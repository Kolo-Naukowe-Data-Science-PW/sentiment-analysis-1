"Kaitscralt",2011-05-08,"best episode so far without a doubt the pacing finally found a rhythm and they stopped to explain the back stories to four important characters plus three direwolves including ghost kitjon stole every scene he was in"
"RAddichio",2011-05-08,"gave ep4 a 9 last weeks ep was my fav so far i didnt understand why ghost appeared for a split second tonight after not seeing him anywhere other than the 1st ep when jon discovered him as a pup tournament was exciting and rather gruesomeas written"
"Mr Bean",2011-05-08,"best episode so far without a doubt the pacing finally found a rhythm and they stopped to explain the back stories to four important characters plus three direwolves including ghostkitjon stole every scene he was inbest episode to datethe episode in which sir allister is the world biggest dick to everyone in existencebest episode gave it a ten"
"Ran",2011-05-08,"ghost was in episode 2 hes lying down near jon and tyrion"
"Valmy",2011-05-08,"i do love how gloomy and serious all the starks are in the series especially jon robb and ned as it should be"
"Bishop437",2011-05-08,"yes i also feel it was the best yet love that we get to see ghost in all his glory now some will complain that he shouldnt be growling but good luck explaining that to a television audiance wish the tourney was a bit more involved but the essential thing happened it was weird that the hounds story was told but littlefinger but at least it was told love that theon finally gets introduced and explained my guess is we are about 2 episodes from viserys being crowned could happen next but i dont think so thought the crossroads inn was perfect i like that it was bronn who tyrion threw the coin to and we hear of the freys of the crossing curse them curse them curse them what else oh yeah the three eyed crow i was afraid they would skip it but it appears my fears were unfounded well done indeed rated this one a ten"
"Lord Godric",2011-05-08,"by far the best one of the season so far loved the dialogue and action"
"SergioCQH",2011-05-09,"another vote for the best episode thus far bryan cogman just did the exposition better than dd"
"moonjump05",2011-05-09,"the lf telling sansa the hounds story ruined this one for me sorry thumbsdowngif classbbcemoticon altthumbsdown "
"Daenerys",2011-05-09,"loved it im going to be a dick and only give it an 8 even though it probably deserves a 9 main reason being nothing super exciting happened and a few scenes were slightly awkward or unnecessary but overall the show is starting to feel more smooth and flow more naturally sansa continues to grate on me but i suppose shes supposed to at this point to some extent"
"John (Snow) Doe",2011-05-09,"7 this episode was very refreshing after last weeks travesty there was legitimate plot advancement exposition was laid out by means other than shameless 2way dialogue and there were some good action scenes i still think this show is dangerously lacking in wow factors that will sustain a nonreader audience the writers should be smarter about departures from the book  instead of having another exposition scene such as the one with viserys in the tub why not have a dothraki raid on an anonymous village or a flashback to a battle in balon greyjoys rebellion there are better ways to give information and advance the story ways which could also offer broader appeal i agree with moonjump05 that littlefinger telling the hounds story was painful  why do we have to learn about everybody and everything this way it felt just like last weeks terrible scene in which jaime recounted the executions of rickard and bran stark on that note sophie turner actually earned some points in my book this week  ive been skeptical on her acting thus far but i think she finally showed some promise overall im losing faith in this show  its employing the same formula each week and there isnt much creativity or risk taking in the writing and directing i think a lot of people on this forum should take the view of a nonreader and essentially ask is this a good show apart from its foundation in great literature there is a lot of ratings inflation going on"
"arrowfan",2011-05-09,"yea jon is really nailing all his scenes perfect casting and acting only scene i didnt like so much was viserys and jiqui in the bath tub maybe because it was such a departure for the books still it was a op to advance some the legenddragon aspects of the story viserys is doing a great job though sam is awesome was really happy with his scenes his friendship with jon is believable too bad we dont get more ghost im missing the bonding between jon and ghost the hands tourney was pretty good gregors lance through the squires throat was gruesome gave gregor a good deal of foreboding didnt like that lf told sansa the story of sandors burned face instead of sandor himself hmmm seems like a missed op to develop sandors character theon is growing on me didnt like the casting at first but think he did a good job in this ep ending was pretty good overall gave it an 810"
"lifefullofwords",2011-05-09,"definitely the strongest episode to date the previous ones were good but had some clunky scenes and the exposition was often heavyhanded this episode flowed very smoothly and the transitions between the different locations were much cleaner they did a great job with brans dream and the threeeyed crow i wasnt sure how they were going to pull it off but i was very impressed especially given how difficult dream scenes are to film it was also an excellent way to begin the episode i like the way theyre mixing scenes that are drawn almost verbatim from the book like the one between ned and littlefinger in the garden and entirely new scenes like the one between tyrion and theon it makes the show more interesting to me than it would be if it only contained scenes from the book not that that would work anyway i agree that kit harrington is absolutely nailing jon and stealing every scene hes just perfect and i couldnt be more pleased since jons one of my favorite characters and it was great to see sam although i dont think the actor playing him has quite settled into the role yet which makes sense since its his first episode im not sure how i feel about littlefinger telling sansa how sandor was hurt by his brother in the book it is very important the he tells her that personally but they still have plenty of time to build their relationship and i hope there will be some interesting scenes between them to come in the next few episodes overall an excellent episode i gave it a 9"
"Daenerys",2011-05-09,"alliser thorne is great in this episode he really came off as not just a bully which is what i got from him in the books but someone who has to be a jerk in order to get these soft boys ready becauseyou knowwinter is coming hes seen whats out there he knows what will happen if you arent ready kind of reminded me what curly says to billy crystal in city slickers after he throws a knife through a guys crotch ive crapped bigger than you he put jon and sam in their place but unlike in the book im on his side hes right"
"Hyper",2011-05-09,"i rate this episode an 8 my vote history 7 8 7 and now 8 the episode finally flowed well where each scene had room to breathe and play out unlike the hectic last episode the infodumping was well handled  i liked all the nonbook scenes and they all filled in a lot of valuable back history all jonsam scenes were great littlefinger as well the loss of sandor interaction so far doesnt bother me at all  ive never understood that shippingesque obsession many fans have for that relationship"
"Daenerys",2011-05-09,"the loss of sandor interaction so far doesnt bother me at all  ive never understood that shippingesque obsession many fans have for that relationshipregardless of how you feel about the relationship wouldnt it be much more dramatic for the hound himself to describe his own brother burning his face off and right now sandor needs a personality i doubt a lot of people even have much sense of him at all littlefinger does not need to be telling that story his personality is well established already and he will have plenty more screen time coming also why keep cutting back to shots of gregor after the joust wih his face still covered by the helmet wouldnt that be a good opportunity to give him a little nonverbal acting is he smirking happy about the having brutally killed a man sad horrified indifferent confused contemplative we cant tell"
"Lady Blackfish",2011-05-09,"while i had individual issues overall this episode was such an improvement over last weeks that im too aglow to be able to enumerate them which means a lot coming from me its definitely the most ive viscerally enjoyed an episode of got so far jon and sam were terrific and the added jaime scene with jory was a neat idea  you can tell the show gets these characters at least not brilliant yet but solid and entertaining edited by lady blackfish 09 may 2011  0436 am"
"lokisnow",2011-05-09,"damn the show gets better and better that was a ten the first ten of the season i was starting to get worried but it keeps improving they opened with an 8 barely pushed over to a 9 improved a little bit more the third time out but it was really the fourth time that was this shows charmand now pretty much every domino has been set and with tonights ending lady stark just knocked over the first one its all downhill from here i think itll be epicregardless of how you feel about the relationship wouldnt it be much more dramatic for the hound himself to describe his own brother burning his face off and right now sandor needs a personality i doubt a lot of people even have much sense of him at all littlefinger does not need to be telling that story his personality is well established already and he will have plenty more screen time coming also why keep cutting back to shots of gregor after the joust wih his face still covered by the helmet wouldnt that be a good opportunity to give him a little nonverbal acting is he smirking happy about the having brutally killed a man sad horrified indifferent confused contemplative we cant tellnaw i never really understood why the hound would actually blab to sansa it makes sense for littlefinger to purvey that particular information and its a little creepy how hes using it to kind of impress sansai think they kept gregor in that armor because hes only really going to be seen in his armor hell be an icon recognizable by the gargantuan presence he imposes rather than his face and something about the armor design screamed spoiler gregorstein to me edited by lockesnow 09 may 2011  0431 am"
"reiver",2011-05-09,"i rated it 7 it was a decent episode but had too many flat and seemingly pointless scenes with protracted backstory im rather baffled that after 3 episodes of dancing around names and history when it would have been appropriate that we got such an info dump with this ep not that im opposed to filling in the history but it all seemed a bit forced clumsy and unnatural i also dont like a lot of the changes im not a book purist and i accept the need to reshape for a different medium i just think that too much has been mangled and lost for the sake of changing rather than to improve so many of the good lines have been plucked and replaced with cliched pap that seems to be from bbc drama rather than the hbo shows i love this isnt even scratching the awesomeness of rome or deadwood"
"The Anti-Targ",2011-05-09,"definitely a step up ghost looked great and tbh i never really cared that ghost was mute thats ubergeek stuff and im just a regular geek i thought it all came together fine i think theyve done it reasonably well by bringing in some history at this point though i do wonder if ep4 might not have been a tad late to bring the n00bs up to speed"
"Ahriman",2011-05-09,"best episode so far"
"Eddard house stark",2011-05-09,"excellent thought the scenes with sam finally showed the true character of jon great ghost scene hodor looks nothing like i would have imagined cersei looked like a geisha the hound is getting underplayed and littlefinger overplayed"
"Abaddon",2011-05-09,"overall im losing faith in this show  its employing the same formula each week and there isnt much creativity or risk taking in the writing and directing i think a lot of people on this forum should take the view of a nonreader and essentially ask is this a good show apart from its foundation in great literature there is a lot of ratings inflation going oni think youre missing that a lot of people understand its incredibly challenging to translate something to the screen from a book particularly one written with a pov structure and they are doing a great job while the experience is naturally distilled from the book i firmly believe that if one watches the show they are getting a great experience my spouse would agree i was out of town last week and she rewatched the 3rd episode without me they can then go to the book and flesh out backstory without many contradictions at alli also think the new scenes have for the most part been very well done giving us glimpses of character interaction we could never see in the book and in a very believable way i am very pleased how well those are coming off so far as they really underscore how well the show creators understand the characters of course there are a minority of cases where i dont like the changes but overall well done ddso yeah if its not working for you thats too bad but i think people here are being honest and i think its a bit cheeky to suggest theres ratings inflation going on when youre part of the ratings deflation crew just as much i personally think both characterizations are silly were all just giving our honest opinions here"
"Abaddon",2011-05-09,"as far as my own rating i would give this a 9 probably the best episode for me so far but i am expecting bigger and better things as the story starts opening up again for the record my ratings so far were 8 9 6 and now 9 the 6 was maybe a little harsh i might up it to a 7 on further reflection but it was easily the most disappointing episode for me so far so i felt it was appropriate to distance it from the 1st episode by more than one point and will probably keep it thereabout the only real gripe i have one obviously shared with many others is that the hands tourney looked very good but way too poorly attended really theyre spending all of this gold on the purse but only 20 people show up disappointing i understand why and it didnt ruin the episode or anything but a really grand tourney would have taken this one easily to a 10 for meive been excited each week for the next episode with the exception of this weeks due to my disappointment with last weeks so thats another indication that it has been the outlier for me so far the story is really going to explode starting next week and continuing all of the way through the end and i cant wait"
"drawkcabi",2011-05-09,"i thought it was the best episode so far but i know the story and characters so well i cant help but be subjective it was just that this was the first episode that felt like the books all the way through to me the previous 3 feeling not having this impact even so its been a while since i read the books i didnt even remember until reading this thread that it was sandor himself that told his story about his brother burning him my only minor complaint is at the point where tyrion is tossing the coin at theon and then leaves to go to the brothel outside winterfell as the scene switches it looked like the training yard for castle black was right outside the walls of winterfell it might not look that way on a second viewing if i pay better attention but the point is only because i knew better i wasnt confused where i think i might have been if i hadnt read the books"
"Bronn Stone",2011-05-09,"this one gets an 8 from me i think that it was a bit of an error to run two actionlight episodes backtoback i would have extended the battle where jon names sam his queen of love and beauty jon mowed through three men a little too easily imo and the episode needed some good swordplay this could have been done easily enough without busting the budget like some elaborate flashback definitely would have got a hint of the complications of dealing with the dogs in the scene with rast just to have the thing sit on him and growl appeared to have been difficult enough that they didnt really show ghost and any of the actors in the scene at the same time i suspect that just getting that growl took forever i knew the decision to have lf reveal the hound story would be unpopular here and im not crazy about it but i do like it as a way to show that lf is privy to all sorts of information that is dangerous and secret also liked that the lfsansa dynamic was not too overly creepy at first sophie looked great  she seemed a lot younger in this scene than in previous ones ser hughs ugly demise clearly shook her of her storybook ideas i was a little bit disappointed in that while catelyn apparently saw the bat of whent the twin towers of frey and the stallion of bracken in the inn i could see nothing of them i understand that there is a concern that you dont want to make the livery look like superhero costumes i serve lady whent call me batman but the whole point of livery is that it becomes a uniform in the chaos of battle"
"Mad Queen",2011-05-09,"7 because of all the jonsamwall goodness the welldone scene at the inn and most dany scenes but everything else especially the expository dialogue could have been better thumbs up for gendry too"
"flyingwind66",2011-05-09,"i gave a 9 my highest rating yet i loved this episode biggringif classbbcemoticon altd  sam didnt look or sound like how i imagined but that was all ok because he did such a bang up job with his acting i thought it was funny how they kept mentioning rossrose i guess shes that redhead with tyrion in the first episode lol i bet that totally unspoiled speculation thread is going to think shes way more important than she actually is haha i like how they added in that scene with jon and sam talking about girls and sex really helped show jons hang up on being a bastard and not fathering any etc it pretty much replaced benjen with sam for this bit of jons development as a deeper character im ok with them delaying that from episode 1 to now haha also woot to ghost being there edited by flyingwind66 09 may 2011  1231 pm"
"Steinman",2011-05-09,"best so far but still not a 10"
"Ara",2011-05-09,"2 they seem to have held the hands tourney at my local renaissance fair that was pretty bad and disappointing as i was looking forward to this part of the series since the beginning"
"Daenerys",2011-05-09,"2they seem to have held the hands tourney at my local renaissance fair that was pretty bad and disappointing as i was looking forward to this part of the series since the beginningagreed it did look very ren faire budget just like so much else absence of direwolves is one lots of movies with all kinds of animals doing all kinds of things kings landing also feels kind of small to me although i like the area around the blacksmith where they found gendry and the dothraki wedding looked very sparse and unimpressive but even if they cant show a wide shot of thousands of people it would have been nice to pack the stands around where the starks are sitting a little more than 3 deep can it really cost that much for a couple dozen extras i mean most little league games are better attended than this grand tournament if the show does well hopefully theyll up the budget a little bit to make things feel larger remember when the holodeck was just a small room with bright tronstyle grid lines on the wallshowever i think rating it down to a 2 is way too harsh i thought the episode was very good and the small size of the tournament didnt ruin it for me edited by daenerys 09 may 2011  0243 pm"
"RAddichio",2011-05-09,"i gave ep4 a 9 rather than the 10 for ep3 due to a certain lack of tyrion screentime the imp played by peter dinklage electrifies every scene in which he appears the rather long scene between benjen tyrion and the recruiting officer was especially entertaining in last weeks show best lines i think hes beginning to like me from ep3 while ned starks war is easier than daughters gets that tribute this week characters gaining more oomph than in the book due to a strong performance for me are petyr baelish samwell and jaime another reason ep4 scored slightly less imho is due to the dragged out dragon eggs expository scene the fantasy aspect of game of thrones plays best when exposed least many new hbo subscribers were lured by the historical drama theme  those viewers in particular will remain enthusiastic for the series as long as dragons and whitewalkers are kept to a minimum"

"Gungnir",2011-05-09,"three it was simply put boring to me i enjoyed reading this part of the book but something didnt translate well to the screen i think it was the expository dialogue that really put me off if they could have flashbacks or something anyway regardless of the reason or my overall enjoyment of the tv series high this episode felt like a flop edited by gungnir 09 may 2011  0358 pm"

"Ser_not_appearing_yet",2011-05-09,"i disagree with some of you the exposition is a necessary evil i find it rather annoying but the people who im watching it with new viewers appreciate it its really impossible to tell the story without it of course sometimes it could be delivered better but its definitely necessary and overall doesnt hurt the show"
"Prince of Dinas Emrys",2011-05-09,"i gave it a 9many of the objections i read are from readers complaining that nonreaders wont find the exposition interesting apart from this being a logical fallacy called the psychologists fallacy in which subjective thought processes are projected onto others and taken erroneously as concrete and objective its also irrelevant to whether you enjoyed the show or not why not let the nonreaders decide for themselves whether they like it i dont think the show could sustain such a huge viewing audience if nonreaders werent getting into it the three nonreaders we watch the show with certainly seem to like it"
"Daenerys",2011-05-09,"would you not expect the scores to drift up those who didnt like the first two or three are voting with their clickers we cant all be as clued in as you are thank the godsgood point however i would think the vast majority of anyone reading westerosorg forums are already fairly large fans of the books and i doubt very many of them are going to stop watching the series perhaps a very small handful who simply cannot accept any deviation from the books exactly as imagined by them"
"YoDaddy",2011-05-09,"im also gonna have to say i was dissapointed in this one the tourney was very unimpressive and this part of the story as a whole just didnt measure up to what i pictured too bad i loved episode three i didnt expect hodor to be 40 either"

"nim",2011-05-10,"best episode yet but still gave it just a 65 i have a hard time believing that nonreader fans are keeping interest at this point maybe my expectations are too high but im constantly disappointed this is the first episode where lfs lines dont feel completely flat but his explanation of sandors burn was a bit painful where are varys giggles i also am not a big fan of sean bean i know that he is supposed to come across as brooding and wary but to me he just looks slightly confused and i was so excited when hodor was called but when he came out was like wth that being said jonsamalliser  pure joy i also think cersei is fantastic jaime too and theon  wow was not expecting that great acting and definitely looking forward to more of him the shows are definitely getting better and looking forward to rating an episode a 10"

"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-10,"as a case in point one scene i found excruciatingly boring was jaime and neds meeting in the throne room towards the beginning of ep 3 what was the point of this scene it was another extended dialogue scene in which historybackground was laid out staging it between ned and jaime only served to establish enmity between them but that had already been done how much cooler would it have been for ned to walk into the room and then a panoramic shot of the room fades to the same room 20 years ago showing the starks roasting and aerys laughing manically it would have given us the same information in a more interesting way using the advantages of a screen medium overwhelming the audience with exposition via dialogue makes for a generally boring show and alienates a lot of viewers it threatens the longevity of the showits of course always a matter of opinion but im not at all unhappy with that we havent gotten flashbacks that can at times come off as cheesy storytelling so its not a given that it would work well and i also see merit in two good actors establishing themselves their relationship if you dont continually build on a rivalry it wont seem very strong or important and history through good acting rather than showing something that only gives us part of that and at a higher cost the flashback would put less focus on the now and more on the past which i think is the reversed of how they want it i understand your point about show not tell but i didnt find that necessary there then again i love good scenes with nothing but talk so my opinion if of course in that context flashbacks also have the problem of either having a different actor play a current role and thus not looking particularly similar or to use the same actors and make people wonder why they looked about the same about 16 years agoin short i agree that it could have been done with a flashback but not in that it would necessarily have been better or even as goodlooking at the ratings in which the lowest episode ranking when adjusted for outliers is close to an 8 its pretty clear to me theres some inflation look at how many people in their reviews each week write best episode ever im enjoying this show i think its great  but its not as great as it could be for obvious reasons most of my friends whore watching the show as nonreaders are confused and disillusioned as fans i think we should be most critical of the show by handing out high praise in light of the shows shortcomings i feel were undermining its potentiali rather think that focusing on negatives will enhance the negative experience just as focusing on the positives will do the opposite i think that if a reviewer gives a grade he should talk roughly as much about the positives as the scores percentage value of the scale and spend the rest on negatives so i dont see why someone shouldnt hand out high praise if he really enjoyed an episode thats after all the entire point of the show to entertainas for the actual grades theres no definition for the scale or ive missed it so people might very well be grading things on differently defined scales which of course means that one has to take that into consideration when judging the importance of it"

"valacirca",2011-05-10,"i gave the e04 a 7 placing it ahead of e03 but behind e02 and e01 my biggest gripe about it was that most of it felt like stuff that wasnt in the book either changed or added although interestingly i thought that overall the differences in e04 didnt feel as jarring as e03my thoughts on e04 for starters i loved the treatment they gave to brans vision with the crow the way it was presented in the show was subtle and enigmatic which i felt was very effective and intriguing if they had played that straightup id bet that it would have come across as corny the following scene with tyrion and jon was also well done excellently condensed and adapted from the book imo the portrayal of hodor was spot on btw and peter dinklage was awesome as per usual samwell tarly wasnt quite the way i imagined him to be though he seems like a mentally unstablechallenged teenager in parts  the type that becomes a serial killer in the future  rather than a gentle cowardly lad didnt like how they made jon fight 1on3 compared to 3on3 in the book combined with the fight being way too short it makes jon look too much like a prodigious super solider lol  grenn spewing out spit  the way they portrayed vaes dothrak was so beautiful from afar  even better than how i imagined it doesnt it supposedly have a wall though  but again the shortcoming of set design comes into play again here so many interior shots viserys  doreah in the tub and viserys vs dany in the hut for example but very little shots to give us an idea of how vaes dothrak looks doreahs beautiful nudity aside i thought that hot tub scene with viserys was nicely done though didnt get the point of the sansa  septa mordane scene i felt they could have cut that out but the moment i saw arya atop the steps on one leg i immediately had this big dumb grin on my face smilegif classbbcemoticon alt  yeah like that lol i still feel like littlefinger comes across as quite a flat dry and bland portrayal when i imagine he should be one of the more colorful characters really disappointed with lf i was waiting for the part where they were going to go at rast in his sleep because i wanted to see ghost so much and he was there and he was ferocious but the scene was way too fast a simple stern understand from jon then a nod of acknowledgement from rast would have made the scene much better also not seeing ghost for most of the wall scenes and then seeing ghost again felt kind of weird anyway the succeeding scene where the guys would touch sam was quite amusing and i loved thornes parting words neds conclusion that gendry is the kings bastard came too quick as well that scene with jaime and jory if jaime was the sly and cunning lannister that he is i would have imagined that he would rather have accepted neds message for the king from jory and read it himself instead of sending jory away with the message undelivered dany vs viserys was very well played great job by both actors and an excellent adaptationcondensation directly from the book not digging the jonsam interaction in general not bad but idk cant quite put my finger on it ser jorah mormont may possibly be one of the more major characters that i care for the least in the show as of now ser hughs death at the hands of gregor was excellently almost exactly how i hoped it would be maybe a bit too little buildup of tension but negligible it was as brutal bloody and merciless as i felt looking forward to more gregor in the next episode but i really really didnt like that they made littlefinger tell the houndandmountain story because aside from the fact that im not liking lfs portrayal at all i think it would have been way more effective if they made the hound tell it himself like it was in the book i also didnt get why arya was there with sansa during the joust it seemed to be a pointless change from the book cersei and neds scene was pretty good i liked seeing cersei looking and sounding like a sly and cunning lannister final scene with cat and tyrion was solid as well classic peter dinklage goodness not the best of cliffhangers but it sets up the next episode perfectly if done right e05 could very well be one of the best episodes in the series the chapters theyll be covering in the book for e05 hold tons of potential for great tv edited by valacirca 10 may 2011  1024 am"

"Loras",2011-05-10,"i rated this one an 8  although it would have been an 85 im rounding down because i think that everything is about to step up a gear in the next episodes and i want to save my 9s and 10s this episode finally managed to make all the stories fit into one episode without any of them feeling rushed or disjointed it allowed room for breathing space in the plots particularly at the wall where we begin to understand what drives jon snow and once again he shows a range of emotion rather than sullen and forelorn an excellent scene between sam and jon while they cleaned the table was slightly ruined by clunky dialogue about jons surname but these two actors have chemistry and the potential for the relationship in future episodes is exciting cogman had a really difficult job with this episode maybe the most difficult of all the episodes in the first season he had to move all of the pieces to a point where the main storylines reach a precipice so whether that be setting up or developing a conflict in the case of jon and dany or csi kings landing adding depth to the capital storyline and layers to the players there i loved how the conflict between the hound and the mountain was set up his dialogue was frequently brilliant his new scene with theon and tyrion for example but sometimes poorly executed what is my name but he has done the job of the episode finally we have the scene which pushes the pieces off the precipice michelle fairley really acted the hell out of that scene i am loving what she is doing with catelyn roll on the next episode hopefully fairley and dinklage duking it out will be the major thread of the episode"
"valacirca",2011-05-10,"instead they are sticking so closely to the book that they are falling into the trap of telling us what happenshappened instead of showing usi totally disagree with this like i previously said my biggest gripe about e04 is that most of it felt like stuff that wasnt in the book either changed or added there should be more faithfulness to the source material than modifications to it to fit the medium imo for the most part the boring and jarring parts ive encountered so far in the series have stemmed from the liberties that have been taken with the story although there isnt anything too major and there are welcome additions that were nicely done"
"Xenophon",2011-05-10,"hmm this was an odd one for me i liked all the individual scenes but i felt they didnt fit together into a whole and the episode as a whole left me fairly cold imo all the previous episodes packed a serious emotional punch because the various storylines complemented each other so well i didnt get that here each bit was good but they didnt seem to build on each other other than a slight thematic connection between bran and sams stories i didnt feel like the various scenes commented on each other in the way that danys marriage reflected on cerseis in ep 1 or nedarya reflected on cerseijoffrey in ep 3 overall though it was engrossing and they did a good job of setting future action up while still keeping things interesting in this episode so im giving it a 7 my rankings for the season are now 7887 edit interesting i seem to be decidedly in the minority comparing the poll results from last week to this week edited by xenophon 10 may 2011  1123 am"

"McGinnis",2011-05-12,"voted 9 i think they handled most of the episode extremely well stuff is finally starting to happen to quote one of my nonreader friends all of whom love the show more with each episode  in fact one of them is considering the books because of it i loved the way dany threatened viserys after he attacked her i might be misremembering but she didnt do that in the book did she i really should know this since ive already read it 3 times but oh well loving kit harington as jon snow but then again i thought he was perfect pretty much from the first episode i didnt care too much for the viserys  doreah bathtub scene but i did like how viseryss mood suddenly changed at the end of it really shows his character in a way the books didnt i was afraid it was just going to be a gratuitous sex scene between them but then the scene redeemed itself could have been a bit shorter though they also established thorne as a prick but he does kind of speak the truth liking sam so far but ill have to see how they handle him in season 23 when he starts to play a more important part was nice to finally see some of ghost this time around they should have at least shown him walking next to jon in episode 3 i thought the pacing was very good as well this time around though i still think the show would have been much better with those extra 2 episodes grrm wanted i found littlefinger telling sansa the hounds backstory with gregor a little weird and id have preferred if sandor actually told that story himself however knowing about lfs interest in sansa with regards to the later books i do think that this kind of has its place too im not all that bothered by it"

"Ser Kevan Raley",2011-05-11,"i liked the sansa and septa scene it does a good job of establishing some back history and showing us some insight into sansas thoughts and worries showing more of her distrust of her father helps sets up the scene when she goes to ceresi as welli also liked that scene i can actually feel sympathy for the sansa character here something i never did at this juncture in the book surprising given that she had pov chapters my sympathy for book sansa came later towards the end of the first book but especially in the subsequent ones for most of agot i really didnt like her"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-11,"i found the shut up to septa mordane to be extremely jarring i guess in the show were not dealing with a little bird who repeats all the pretty things her septa has taught her but with a rather insolent teenager its hard to imagine sansa of the books ever telling someone to shut up well okay she would say it to aryai dont see why sansa cant be both people act very differently around their families and septa mordane is as close as family as you get for sansa than they do towards others i have no trouble believing that sansa will be courteous to everyone like she is in the book other than that she snapped at her septa once the change is very minor in my eyes"

"Huan",2011-05-11,"khal will get is big moment in episode 6 is my prediction agreed the title of the episode is a golden crown also behind the scenes clips maybe the dothraki language featurette show him doing a lot of jumping around and shouting probably in the scene where dany eats the horse heart theres a shot of drogo picking her up and her face smeared with blood edit the episode description includes viserys receives his final payment for daenerys from drogo edited by huan 11 may 2011  1132 am"
"Ser Bronn o the Blackwater",2011-05-11,"i also noticed the harrenhal and bracken sigils on the shields as for the frey guy the only thing i can think of is he was wearing a cloak maybe it was on there but we never see his back a few other notices on the whoknowswhatnumber rewatch they finally got around to showing peoples breath on the wall which makes the cold a little more believable i like that arya finally mentions the kingsguard but not that its still not explained the genealogy book was indeed open to the baratheon page with the dagger knife sitting right on top of it if you look when they approach vaes dothrak you can see the khalasar stretching all along the road into the distance in front of dany and jorah so it is quite a bit bigger than it seems and a few nice moments when jon asks grenn are you sure you want to do this grenns matteroffact no is priceless and when the kingslayer is talking to jory jory they like their bloodshed jaime they quit liking it at the end all in all definitely one of my favorite episodes to date agree that the tub scene was too long and the tourney scene too short but that should be remedied on sunday"
"busyizzy",2011-05-11,"hi im new ive been reading a lot of the posts on the episodes though read all the ones on episode 4 just wanted to add a few things 1 while i agree the viserys bathtub scene went on way too long i appreciated it in that it shows that viserys can be charming  much like his father remember he was almost described as bipolar  charming for a time and then completely mad and psycho eventually the psycho portions took over more and more viserys to me clearly takes after his father so it was an interesting to see his charming moments too  and then snap at the end i actually wished he made the snap a little more prononciated  like slapping her or something a little more extreme than just telling doreah she is a stupid girl 2 i actually did not mind that littlefinger got the hounds lines i think it is a nod to what happens in the future with littlefinger and sansa at the vale after this i dont think they interact much at all but my memory is fuzzy  its been a while since i read the books what with littlefinger trying to appear as disinterested in sansa as possible if we ever do get to season 4  itll be nice for nonreaders to go back to season 1 and see that littlefinger did take a bit of an unusual vested interest in sansa its nice that while littlefinger did answer aryas question and didnt ignore arya persay its clear his attention is all focused on sansa i do think the hound will get his due with sansa  right now i think they want a little littlefinger screentime with sansa before they never talk to each other again till season 4 lol i think he did an awesome job being a creeper  i loled so hard at that gif xd i totally agree with what someone said before  he was trying to impress her and what other story could he tell he just told her why he was called littlefinger lol"

"Ser Warpechowski",2011-05-11,"the post above me did give me an idea maybe the reason why lf told sansa about the hound story right there was meant to create a link between the mountain and the hound that way you know they are both brothers and the hound being a bannerman to the lanisters infers that gregor is also a folower of the lanisters i watched a review from that guy otakuassemble and he got to the conclusion that it was a setup after realizing the things iâve wrote above also the tv show dont explore lf obsession with cat as much as the book maybe they made him speak that just as a hint for future things to come"

"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-11,"i also got the impression that gregor just killed hugh because he could although thats an obvious conclusion as thats what the hound says i think the probability of it being an intentional killing of a suspect is the same in the book and on the show which is slim since gregor takes orders from tywin and probably tells almost anyone else to shove it or worse if they arent important enough if they try to order him the show can of course give a different perspective on gregor but it hasnt yet theres always a good point to make the audience wonder if it was ordered or not though edited by tywins bastard 11 may 2011  0513 pm"

"FilliamHMuffman",2011-05-12,"it was a decent episode better than last week but still struggled translating the book into a visual medium exposition should only be used to introduce backstory that is relevant to the plot that cant be conveyed easily in a dramatic way exposition was justified for the story of the clegane brothers and to explain theons status at winterfell although for the latter the exchange between tyrion and theon was sufficient and the scene between jaime and jory redundant the rest should have been cut viewers who want to delve into the series lore should pick up the books tv is a poor medium for conveying that kind of information this episode needed more tournament spectacle and less characters reminiscing about the past yes yes i know the budget but as with the lack of direwolves i as a viewer just want to be entertained and i can appreciate why the creators have made certain choices while still being somewhat disappointed with the result edited by filliamhmuffman 12 may 2011  1152 am"
"FilliamHMuffman",2011-05-12,"i also got the impression that gregor just killed hugh because he could although thats an obvious conclusion as thats what the hound says i think the probability of it being an intentional killing of a suspect is the same in the book and on the show which is slim since gregor takes orders from tywin and probably tells almost anyone else to shove it or worse if they arent important enough if they try to order him the show can of course give a different perspective on gregor but it hasnt yettheres always a good point to make the audience wonder if it was ordered or not thoughit feels too convenient to simply be a coincidence but if gregor knew ser hugh was suspected in a lannister plot to murder jon arryn its plausible he took the initiative to eliminate him and win favor from his lord without having been ordered to kill him by anyone edited by filliamhmuffman 12 may 2011  1254 pm"
"Tyrion Lannister",2011-05-12,"the tournament cost a fortune because of the purse not the tourney itself  at least thats how the tv show explains it would need to reference the book for how it is conveyed therei just read this chapter in the book last nightthe purse total adds up to 90000 gold and littlefinger immediately starts talking about all of the additional expenses theyll have to figure in a couple of paragraphs later he says we owe lord tywin three million dragons at present what matter another hundred thousand so at least according to littlefingers initial estimates the purse is definitely the primary reason the tourney was so expensive edited by tyrion lannister 12 may 2011  1226 pm"

"Eponine",2011-05-12,"in the book there doesnt seem to be any seeding and gregor and ser hugh meet in gregors second joust near the end of the day jaime and the hound had already ridden once or twice by that point and ser hughs death doesnt end the jousting it resumes almost immediately that was the day that ser loras gave sansa a red rose after his last joust and she takes it to mean something which it of course does not at that point only gregor sandor jaime and loras are left and the last three jousts are delayed because of how late in the night its gotten im disappointed that the show didnt follow the book at all in this regard making it seem like gregor and ser hugh were the only joust of the day because as others have mentioned the joust is one of the most visually spectacular events in the book with a lot of characters appearing in one place showing a few more jousts and having more of the court interacting in the stands would have been a good way to visually introduce some new characters and give other characters more face time like it wouldnt be that important at this point to be able to identify or explicitly label beric thoros loras some different kingsguard members etc at this point but having them around the tourney grounds would have filled out the scene and maybe some people would remember  hey ive seen that guy around the court before  when they became more important varys hints to ned that ser hughs death wasnt accidental because ser hugh was lord arryns poisoner i cant remember if this is something that varys knows for a fact or not  or even if he knows that littlefinger rather than cersei was responsible i thought that lysa alluded to doing the poisoning herself but since shes not the brightest bulb she probably would have considered getting the squire to do it the same as doing it herself without thinking through the full consequences of involving someone else and leaving littlefinger to dispose of him"

"Lord Varys",2011-05-12,"ser hugh is just an distraction he had nothing to do with the poisoning and subsequently it makes little sense to assume that gregor clegane murdered him during the tourney on cerseis orders who in turn had nothing to do with the whole plot its pretty likely that varys and littlefinger were into the poisoning together and both presented ser hugh as a scapegoat to protect themselves and to prevent any further investigations on his side after ned has spoken to varys and littlefinger about ser hugh he is convinced that he killed jon arryn on cerseis orders but due to hughs death he has no proof of that and his whole investigation is another dead end without sansas outburst about joffrey and robert ned would never have guessed the truth about the incest varys definitely confirms his involvement in the death of jon arryn during his talk with illyrio and we are likely to hear some of these lines in the next episode after all the wolf and the lion is a direct quote of varys "

"Juba",2011-05-15,"this is another example of taking lines from the book and not making sure it makes sense with what is on film you shouldnt have to screengrab to see whats being spoken of and for the life of me i just cant understand the producers decision to downplay the heraldryit has the advantage of being true to the books and the period that inspired the setting as well as a visual cue to keep track of the various factionsand much cooler to boot as it is aside from the lannister menatarmswho are so goofy looking and inappropriate that they kill all immersion whenever they appear on screenthe retinues all look the same how hard is it to sew small heraldry badges on whatever leatherpadded armour they give them another thingdoes the bracken dude have a bad french accent or is it just me"
"Lord of Brewtown",2011-05-20,"juba  agree i would think this would be about the cheapest part of the costume too just sew some artwork on or have them wear a cheap tabard probably easierless costly than the shields i did notice the bracken shield during first viewing but not the bat of harrenhall"

"SerArthurHeath",2011-05-13,"having watched it properly now i have to say im impressed with pretty much all of the character portrayals i particularly loved jaime and jorys exchange jaime would have refused to take the letter  he hates games and politics he hates the idea that ned can give him orders and he was angry because his reminiscence of fighting which makes him feel alive was interrupted by a reminder that robert is disrespecting cersei by making jaime guard an orgy i also think sophie turner as sansa is one of my favourite portrayals in the show  of course she looks like a whiny teenager thats exactly what shes meant to be in this episode i had no problem with anybodys acting at all gregor looks terrific in both meanings of the word and i cant wait for next episode now a lot of the character basics and backstories have been set we can get some more nuances and action special mention also goes to allister thorne who i thought was exceptionally well played"

"SerArthurHeath",2011-05-03,"the fact that the direwolves specifically ghost have been totally ignored has made this nothing more than a poorly acted soap opera the character development and poor insight on the part of the directors has disappointed me if you did not read the books you would have no idea what is going on further the characters are so poorly developed that each incident seems to have occurred in a vacuum with no connection or significance to other characters this will get cancelled before season two begins filmingdo you really believe that so far the feedback from new viewers is that they have as much idea of what is going on as new readers did at this point some have worked out some pretty popular fan theories on just 3 poor episodes secondly in what way does having direwolves stop got being a soap opera nd in what way is it one without them the direwolves have been in all the significant scenes that they were involved with in the books ghost isnt meant to have a starring role yet i think the characterisation has been good and though some events dont seem connected ie between the wall and kl and the dothraki they didnt seem any more connected in the book at this point  less so even given the number of characters introduced in 3 episodes which is huge the characterisation has been i think unparalled and i dont know what shows you think you have seen which have done a better or faster job with an even nearly comparable character sheet the acting has also been strong imosho and with a few exceptions which nobody seems to agree on except maybe lena headley very unfairly most viewers have been positive about the acting of all the cast i dont think its perfect but no adaptation can be the same as the book and still be successful in another medium and very few have borne as well to their subject material as got so far in my opinion and this is from someone who did not enjoy the first 500 pages of the first book at all but has had far more pleasure from the tv show probably because i know what is to come"

"A Song of Hound and Wolves",2011-05-08,"great episode gosh i love the guy playing jory i wish he would have been cast in a role that um stays around longer didnt mind the change to the sandor backstory when i realized where they were going with it i thought id mind the change but it ended up working for me all the changes worked for me even the nonbook viserys bathing scene and i loved the nearly verbatim final scene arrest of tyrion at the inn two enthusiastic thumbs up"

"King's Landing",2011-05-08,"great episode here i like ayra learning to dance also when she tells her father no that is not me love the wall sequences with jon and sam and we did see ghost yay the joust was good but i agree that sir hugh wasnt even trying still good to see the mountain next week we will see the rest of tournament looking forward to that the beginning with the dream sequence and the 3 eyed crow gotta love it but i wonder if nonreaders will get the significance of it and tyrion did give directions for the basket for bran to ride awesome"
"Trebla",2011-05-08,"i dunno i kinda liked petyrs story about the hound i feel like they are making him more of an enigma i also liked that they somewhat humanized thorne very amused by arya blurting out why do they call you littlefinger that is totally something book arya would do i liked littlefinger alot more in this episode this episode was ripe with backstory the dragons rhaegar sam lots of dragon names i liked the actor who played gendry ghost made an appearence at last and is there anyone in the seven kingdoms who hasnt had sex or almost had sex with redhead rozesme bianco rhaegarrozjon"

"AshaÂ<U+0097>Not Yara!",2011-05-08,"hooboy a lot of people are going to complain about littlefinger telling sansa that story i admit im disappointed too but it does build up the hound as a frightening character the way littlefinger told her that all the knights in realm wouldnt be able to stop him should he get mad hopefully the interaction we get later of sansa and the hound in season 2 will make up for it despite that change i really enjoyed the episode they did a good job and filling up the backstory and i think im going to enjoy the jon and sam scenes even more than i did in the book i also really liked the added scene with sansa and the septa i thought both actresses did a good job with it especially sansa whom i feel is underrated compared to the more easily likable arya edited by mellisandra 08 may 2011  0912 pm"

"So1ar",2011-05-08,"they cant let petyr tell her this storythis is the first decision theyve made that i really dislikeagreed that was sandors best moment in the book and they gave it away overall a really good episode and i cant help but think this series needs 12 episodes instead of 10 to even the pacing somealso at the end when catelyn was listing all the bannermen tyrion had this priceless look on his face that said wtf are you doing"

"MountainThatRides",2011-05-08,"the deal with ser hugh was that he was incompetent never should have been made a knight and he didnt have a squire of his own to help him prepare for the joustcorrect he was an upjumped squire knighted because he was the one who poisoned jon arryn on the orders of the queen or one of her catspaws he had no business riding in that company is how the hound phrased it  and gregors lance goes where gregor bloody wants it to goanyway regarding the episode  it was blissful not every single decision vis a vis the adaptation pleased me but close enough as to make it my favorite episode thus far in the first two minutes we had brans threeeyedcrow dream and a heaping helping o direwolf i thought samwell was spot on and they did well to introduce him with an understandably shortened account of lord randyll tarlys cruelty and establish the beginnings of his friendship with jon the bit of ghost getting jons point across went a long way to make up for the previous lack of the direwolves littlefinger grew on me a bit this episode his dialogue with ned helped along the mystery of jon arryns death and i dont think it suffered overmuch from the condensing renly is still a ghost and i hope his character is established better as the show goes on the viserysdoreah scene actually surprised me i was waiting for it to end until all of the sudden i realized i liked it it went on a bit too long perhaps but it did a lot for targaryen exposition viserys almost felt uncharacteristically charming until the end when he called doreah an idiot and reaffirmed himself as a bitter asshole they did a good job establishing theons character this week so far hes been downplayed and i bet some nonreaders are assuming hes one of the stark kids or something not only did tyrion and his exchange explain who he was and why he was at winterfell but jaime and jory discussed the greyjoy rebellion and the siege of pyke the thoros namedrop made me happythe joust was great though we only got a sliver towards the end ive been waiting for gregors introduction and he was imposing enough the end scene where catelyn arrests tyrion in the inn was better than i expected it to be when all the men of the riverlands drew their swords it was chilling and the look on peter dinklages face was perfect we also got a taste of marillion and poor masha heddlethings i didnt like so much ser alliser thorne is far more sympathetic than he was in the books in fact despite his cryptic diatribe on cannibalism and how delicious sam would taste he made jon seem very immature and arrogant which i suppose is true in the books as well though since youre only seeing it from jons perspective theres an easy bias on the page the dragon name dropping was great  meraxes vhagar and balerion at least the other madeup dragon names sounded weird especially ghiscar ghiscar was an empire not a dragon it was valyrias rival but whateverhodor was funny but way way too old in the books its pretty clear that hodor is younger and good looking at least if osha has good taste in men which she probably doesnt but stillthe little scene with cersei and ned towards the end felt unnecessary im still not sure what the point of it wasi actually liked the gendry scene though in my head the names always been pronounced with a soft g as in gentry my major qualm is that there was no mention of stanniss involvement which is fairly crucial considering later developmentsmost importantly giving the hounds monologue about gregor burning him to petry baelish of all people was disappointing that is one of the best hound moments and now its never coming how much of that character are they going to carve away are we ever going to see the hound get to be the fucking hound so far he just stands around grunting and looking douroverall 8510things im looking forward to next week bronn comes out to play but most importantly gregor vs sandor arms getting cut off the knight of flowers a bad ass tournament fuck yeah i just hope the scene with sansa and the hound is kept even if he cant spill his beans to her since littlefinger already told everyone his story"

"Shillen",2011-05-08,"i loved this episode best of the 4 so far i felt like the first 3 were a bit slow because they had so many elements to introduce this episode managed to give a lot of history and backstory and not feel like a tiresome exercise people really need to stop nitpicking on every little detail if its already bothering you now youre going to be irate by season 2 3 4 the story is only going to diverge more and more as it goes on"
"Bishop437",2011-05-08,"honestly i sort of like the way they introduced ghost meaning that they waited on introducing him until they could introduced him in a way that was really meanacing and in a way sort of supersentient he is by far the most intimidating of the direwolves and i think the scene kind of pulled off that contrastshaggy i think is the most  that fer will kill you quick as look at you"
"Ser Greguh",2011-05-08,"how would you explain ghost and his silence to a television audience its not that importantwell ghosts silence is never exactly explained to the book audience either its creepy in an undefined way in the books and would be the same in the series if thats the direction they choseits a travesty travesty i tell youkidding its a minor minor nitpick but it did make a bit of a frowny face on me as i watched iti am 99999 sure there will still be an awesome scene between sandor and sansa it will likely play out with slightly different dialog than in the books but can convey the same overall tone just as wellactually my biggest issue with the episode was costerwaldeaus accent in the scene between jaime and jory"

"Tyrion Lannister",2011-05-08,"really enjoyed it once again i had no objection to ghost making a sound because im not sure if his silence would have worked quite as well on the screen i also had no problem with littlefinger telling sansa what happened to sandor assuming theyre going to keep the sandorgregor confrontation and why wouldnt they i think that bit of backstory will be a plus for nonbook readers of course im not a huge sandor fan either i dont hate him or love him i just dont have strong feelings one way or the other if i liked the hound as much as some others do maybe id feel differently about that dialogue being given to littlefinger also not a complaint and not something that makes a bit of difference in the overall scheme of things but just an observation do you think viewers who havent read the books rememberknow that rickon exists at this point edited by tyrion lannister 08 may 2011  1055 pm"
"bleecake",2011-05-08,"i think everyone is getting ahead of themselves with sandor although benioff and weiss dont spoil changes often they have stated that they are excited with what has been done with sandor for all we know next episode he does tell her the story and sansa is terrified that he is going to hurt her i really think that this is a watch and find out and think we may be surprised that the sandor arc remains very much alive and welli dont know some people who seem to know appear to be saying that sansan has been axed completely there is still hope that it has been pushed back and not cut of course fingers crossed if they do cut or too heavily truncate the sansan i will be really disappointed the viewing audience will be robbed of one of the most powerful and interesting threads of the series"
"Lord Godric",2011-05-08,"absolutely the best episode so far again loved the dialogue taken straight from the book and finally we are seeing some of the plotting and scheming of kings landing my favorite parts the first where the episode gets its namesake tyrions cripples bastards and broken things line the scene at the inn at the crossroads was very well done also i was surprised that i quite liked dany when she stood up to viserys loved gendry aryas scene with ned was absolutely great but i was waiting for the thats sansa line although sam was a little pathetic at times the scene with him and jon scrubbing the tables was hilarious ghost finally a nice shot of him a few things i am a little torn about they seem to be making jaime a little sympathetic already i dont mind since he will eventually grow into that character but just seems odd to have it so early why do joffrey and sansa hate each other still the tourney was when sansa was so excited to be with her prince but her they hate each other im hoping they make sansa fall back in love with him because it is crucial to her character that she was obsessed with being a princess and joffrey edited by lord godric 08 may 2011  1106 pm"

"Keltess",2011-05-08,"only have one comment about this episode  i have enjoyed the series so far overall why is it littlefinger who reveals to sansa the history between the clegane brothers  this throws a monkey wrench in the plot as far as how sansas character will develop why or how would littlefinger even know seems like it was a dirty little family secret to me and that it was the hound relating it to sansa in her room in private that made for a sick intimacy a try at it anyway"

"Trebla",2011-05-08,"upon a 2nd viewing very much liked summer growling at theon nice foreshadowing as well as just bursting with backstory just about every scene had someone talking about the past yet the episode wasnt bogged down with it in the theontyrion scene i liked the mention of the greyjoy uncles burning the lannister fleet later on doreah mentions a pirate covered in gold and had dyed sails that made me think of euron doreah also mentions dragonglass asshai and the allimportant faceless men a couple of the other dragon names were certainly familiar ghiscar and velaryon the others besides meraxes vhagar and balerion im not sure about ahkahnay and ehsooveees my dad pointed out every time grenn talks spittle flies from his mouth tis true another bit of possible foreshadowing was dany reproachfully saying to mormont you sold slaves woe to you o slavers bay perhaps my favorie scene was the joryjaime scene more backstory and more foreshadowing they mention thoros of myr and his flaming sword and jory declares ill remember that until the day i die oh curse you kingslayer but it was an excellent scene for jaime he went from arrogant to amiable and back again hes having sex with own sister yet he gets offended that robert bangs multiple whores while he stands guard he coldly tells jory he doesnt serve lord stark yet he seems to feel bad for acting like that as jory walks way a complicated man i liked seeing where everyone sat at the joust and i made note of lancel and his amazing hat in the stands behind joffrey tonguegif classbbcemoticon altp  the final scene introduced bronn who was the man who offers to let tyrion take his room sellsword indeed and interestingly enough im not sure that he was one of the men who rose for lady catelyn maybe we couldnt see him from the angle of the last shot but it doesnt look like he rose"

"rigochu",2011-05-08,"the episode started off with good and kept a good pace untilthe viserysinthebathtub scene i loved all the detail and history during that scene but i fear it went a bit long and i cringed when the topic of dragons was brought up again martin was much more subtle in the book when it came to dragons i agree with this sentiment i also disliked the the viserysinthebathtub scene i feel the time could have been put to better use in another scene especially since the biggest problem with this series is that everything feels so rushed and confusing for those who havnt read the book also does anyone else feel like king robert is such a drunken whoremongering pig in the show that one can almost sympathize with cersei and jaime almost tonguegif classbbcemoticon altp  its like why is ned even putting himself and his family in danger for this guy further dislikes for this episode the measely amount of ppl at the tournament cgi crowd maybe and also the fact that ser hughs death is littlefingers cue to break into the hounds story i mean sansa probably just saw her first killing the timing of certain things seems wrong in this series like they merge certain scenes bc of time constraints but then they add silly extra scenes like viserys bathtub scene my last issue would be with all the expository dialogue in this show what is my name jon snow why is my name jon snow because you are a bastard from the north"
"Triskan",2011-05-08,"find anything roberts bastard son cuts right away to a look at jaime nice"
"Rockroi",2011-05-08,"i liked this episode but it was definitely not as impressive as the others most of this was because this was a reeducation episode this is the history of westeroes and how it effects these people while i appreciated it all it was not as interactive as it could have been i felt like i was watching previously on game of thrones i had seen the vast majority of this before on this very series viserys is crazy arya is a girl who is not a girl sansa is hurt and moving with great trepidation in other words shes the only stark who acts this way etc however please do not mistake me this was a really really good episode that i enjoyed here is what i likedthe recreation of sandor clegane people have to accept something and they have to accept it right now this is a different sandor clegane than the one in the books the books clegane was an oftdrunk brash angry bitter man who was all about inflicting his anger and bitterness on others especially the diluted ie young people the show clegane is not that person in the second episode i mentioned how clegane does not laugh when he announces to ned that he caught and killed the butchers boy he is far more somber than the books clegane in the book clegane laughs and almost brags how this boy is dead but in the show an almost vacanteyed sandor simply says that the boy ran not very fast and thats it hes a far more internal far more internalized character in this universe sandor clegane would never tell sansa stark what happened to him just as he would never tell anyone about that weakness instead a bragging swaggering petryr balish revels in the fact that he can telltales out of school about sandor clegane and why not he wants to impress sansa something sandor clegane has never wanted to do in this instance that scene worked very well in no way would this showsandor tell sansa anything like this show clegane is far too guarded far too walled up far too sequestered in his personality to me that scene was not about giving sandors lines to petyr it was about flushing out two characters by showing what one will say about others petryr and what one will never say about himself sandor its time people realized that the book sandor is not the same person as showsandor get used to it sansa stark real human being i continue to enjoy sansa starks problems with being liked and feeling real pressure from a society that expects something from woemn that women have no control over their fertility and what sex their children are that scene had sansa start as the teacher with septa mordane and then turn oh so deliciously to the septa as the student sansa snapping questions at her i liked the duality of that interaction just as i like how sansa seems to be the only stark who realizes how difficult this world is she and she alone seems to understand how her roll is to play out and how very hard that would be on a 11to15 year old i think this actress is bringing an optforgotten dimension to sansa shes a real person who worries the way a real person should ned stark father to us all i am continually pleased with how ned is being portrayed as a concerned yet slightly ineffectual father and how that relationship is played out with arya the obvious reminder to ned of lyanna i really like how warm he is with arya and how arya is like any child almost dismissive of her parents wishes its a classic reminder that parents and their children have a different attitude towards parental dotting and in the demands of the childrens own futurethe foundations of theon grayjoy we got a really really strong impression of what is up with theon i think its a very strong gateway to that character the consistency of jaime lannister jaimes scene was easy to forget but masterful here is jaime reminding some underling of the slings and arrows of petty misfortune he must undergo with robert the fat he fucks women 6 at a time all the while his wifes brother guards his room jaime talks to jory and gets that look again in the prior episode jaime looked right past robert when he described aerys etc same thing here jaime lannister has no idea and absolutely no care at all who jory is jory is nobody to jaime and jaime does not care about him or anything jory ever was when jory reminds jaime that they fought together then and only then did jaime perk up remembering balons rebellion etc much like the previous episode when talking to selmy the only time the humanbeing of jaime comes up is when he is talking about battle and then nothing jaime needs nothing from this person whomever he was and which leaves a great unasked question robert humiliates jaime at every turn and yet jaime is as respectful and passive as a devout churchmouse therefore what the fuck must have aerys done to make jaime want to kill him ser allister thorne no longer a convenient story device i liked that thorne has a method to his madness in order to hold the line in the coldest part of the realm you need harsh men sam sam is a liability in thorns eyes and we have seen what thornes eyes have seen and we can know why he despises such weakness because the wall cannot survive if its tolerated bonus i liked that sam tarly thinks celibacy is a waste well yeah takeitorleave itthe hands tournament plenty of good seats still available would it have killed then to have cgid a few people because it looks like the tournament of the hand was held in springfield massachusetts ghost speaks horray we saw ghost boooo we heard ghost overall pace i thought this episode dragged the most we saw a diverse set of scenes but i thought this episode could have had more put into it cercei comes calling not sure what this scene was supposed to do except give the actress playing cersei needed screen time she wants to put the affair with the wolves behind them but i thought he wolves were not meaningful why does she care what ned thinks is she afraid he really will find something i thought this scene was disjointed at the same time where are they taking the softer cersei its interesting i give them that i cant believe im saying this but did this episode need more joff charming joff to try to win over sansa wouldnty that have helped things why is joff not the brash bastard we all come to know and hate but a sulking mammas boy is this what we want cannibalism really thornes a cannibal now too meh what i did not likehey doesnt the king have two brothers the complete and total lack of even mentioning stannis is poor just like with renly stannis has a huge roll to play in the series its a good idea that they start laying the foundation of that character asap instead they havent mentioned stannis here the scene at the blacksmith was a perfect opportunity to mention that jon arryn came there with stannis and stannis was really focused on gendry and with good reason im finding the ignoring of stannis to be something that could be done much better i thought this was a really strong episode but not as good as the others"
"damian",2011-05-08,"they seem to be making jaime a little sympathetic already i dont mind since he will eventually grow into that character but just seems odd to have it so early i think its necessary to plant a few sympathetic seeds early on in this medium on tv you dont have the benefit of suddenly being thrust inside his head and getting to know him that way when you think about it hes just a giant dick in book 1 barely makes an appearance in book 2 and then we are suddenly thrust inside his head in book 3"
"JaimeNotJamie",2011-05-08,"anyone else think theyre making jaime a tad more sympathetic early on here because he wont have a pov so to speak like he does in the books later part of what helps make jaime a character who people come to root for is that you see events through his eyes and understand his thought process that may be more difficult to convey on screen so they need to plant seeds a bit earlier so the audience isnt entirely predisposed to hate him"

"Xenophon",2011-05-08,"ok so after two fairly distracted viewings i have mixed feeling about this episode on the one hand it had some good scenes but it didnt feel at all thematically unified i feel like i saw a bunch of things but they didnt add up to anything more all the other episodes packed an emotional punch but this one left me cold anyone else feel this way a few random thoughts the dream sequence worked really wellthat crow was creepy as hell i like how theyre making jaime and thorne more sympathetic no pure villains  good tv i liked dany beating up viserys but did not like her bitching jorah out about the slaves wtf girl you know why youre able to tell your brother off because youre married to the biggest slavetrader on the continent thats why and those chicks who do your hair and cook your foodtheyre slaves hypocrisy alert i dont mind her disliking slavery and eventually coming to reject it completely but at this point shes in no position to lecture jorah on the issue"

"ZombieWife",2011-05-09,"my favorite episode so far highlights the story of the mountain and the hound i was wondering when we would get to see conan even though he only lifted his visor more is coming dany standing up for herself viserys is such a little shit harry lloyd is really doing a wonderful job bran and hodor hodor was perfect the scene with branhodor and tyrion in robs throne room was really fun to watch the scene where catelyn and tyrion were at the inn catelyn calling to all the men loyal to riverrun at the end literally gave me chills jon and sam  strong friendship chemistry the wall scenes are some of my favorite more theon yes alfie allen is going to rock this role in season 2 i cannot wait the scene with jaime and jory was great im liking n costerwaldau more and more his portrayal of jaime is subtle and so spot on the dripping sarcasm yet you see vulnerability or a lostness in his eyes i can see why he was chosen for this part there must be a season 3 if only to see what this guy is capable of great shot of ghost hope we get to see more he looks spectacular arya telling ned thats not me when he tells her she will marry a noble lord the look on neds face is so touching maisie williams is really eating that part up sophie turner is doing such a fantastic job as sansa i get the yearning to fit in to the courtly life mingled with the teenage angst lovely stuff kudos all around excited for next week edited by zombiewife 09 may 2011  1217 am"

"Social Justice Bass",2011-05-09,"i just watched itthis was my favorite showing of showjon so far yes he comes across as a bit reserved and quiet much of the time but thats how jon is in the books we just dont notice it as much because we only see jon a couple of times from other peoples points of view sam did not look anything like how i mentally imagined it but i think the actor fits the role i loved his budding friendship with jonas mentioned before they fleshed out ser alliser hes an asshole but not for no reason bookalliser was mostly a onenote asshole and bully and hes mostly described making fun of jon in some way although it was cool seeing viserys describe the dragon skulls this is one area where it would have been freaking awesome to have it shift to a view of the skulls gradually increasing in size until we see the vast skull of balerion the whole scene still felt very clunky and mostly unnecessary i think it would have been better to see viserys brooding over his last encounter with dany before his fight in the tent all that said the actor playing him is mostly perfectlots and lots of exposition in this episode i dont mind it but it felt rather heavy sometimes i dont really see any way around it either  theres so much that has to be introduced even with television streamliningtyrion was fantastic although he needs to express some more emotion i hope well finally see him get pissed off in the next episode his scene with theon greyjoy putting the boy down while introducing greyjoy and setting up his character was greatnot so much for the nedcersei scene on which im divided it just seems totally outofcharacter for cersei to actually apologize to someone who hurt her son in fact has cersei ever had a genuine apology in the series i cant remember the ending was damn cool enough saidi know there are budget constraints but the tournament just seemed too small would it have been really expensive to cgi in some additional crowds at the hands tournamentthere are a whole bunch of little nitpicks i have but they dont really decrease the shows quality in my eyes edited by wise bass 09 may 2011  0132 am"

"Leofric",2011-05-09,"i think one of the reasons they had petyr spill the story of sandors burns was to make the nonreader audience understand that there is more going on in the confrontation between the gregor and sandor in the next episode sandor isnt stepping in to save loras but rather make sure gregor doesnt go too far in front of the king and get himself executed before sandor has a chance to kill him"

"DuckEverlasting",2011-05-09,"loved this episode but to be fair ive been loving them all im rereading the book at the pace of the show and its really cool to see just how much of the script is ripped directly from the books not just dialogue the most nitpicky thing i noticed when jon goes to speak up for sam the first time pyp grabs his arm and holds him back just like in the book coolmore surprising is how much im loving some of these scenes theyve invented for the sake of the show tyrion antagonizing theon viserys using dragon names on doreah to get himself laid jory almostbutnotquite forming a bond with jaime they all feel like something grrm would have written and theyre all scenes between people who dont really interact much in the books unless you count jaime stabbing jorythe scene between jaime and jory might actually have been my favorite of the episode actually you can tell from a few lines that while jory isnt really a fan of lannisters he respects jaime and is almost intimidated by him its going to hit a lot harder now when they fight and im probably going to miss tv jory a lot more than i did book jory kudos to jamie sives im definitely with the people wishing his character stuck around for longer"
"Eponine",2011-05-09,"need more tourney one of the reasons i like book sansa is that we have a common interest in the details of the houses and the members of the court the best part of the show for me is just seeing all the characters still have the complaint why do so many of the nonbook scenes contain never ending soliloquies they stick out in a bad way to me in contrast to the snappy dialogue between multiple characters liked littlefinger more this episode but didnt think he came across as unnaturally interested in sansa because he takes the same faux confidential tone with ned really glad to have more ned action  it came off as much more organic than a lot of the other scenes because not much exposition is needed since its already well established what kind of character ned is the council scenes are my favorite in the book and i cant have too much of them what i can have is too much dany ive gone from being neutral toward her story to really disliking her and almost every scene that shes in i cant suspend disbelief for her and her awful wig tv sam was much more likable than book sam and i think thats a good thing it was hard for me to picture book sam except as a blob of pure annoying still dont like jon but thought making thorne less dumb bad guy was a good change one thing i dislike about book jon is that hes given such a stupid one dimensional enemy with no redeeming qualities where most other characters have complex conflicts with other developed characters showing jon to be actually rather inexperienced and naive instead someone whos always wise and saving the day may make him better eta a bit concerned about pacing i know it took time to establish characters but feels that almost nothing has happened yet compared to the amount of material still left and while the book can get denser and accelerate the action packing it into a tv show isnt the same the main dany event is yet to come theres a big part of the tourney theres the entire tyrion story  including a huge amount of time and action at the eyrie the whole deal with robert i have a hard time envisioning how there will be time for all that without getting very rushed edited by eponine 09 may 2011  0255 am"

"Balefont",2011-05-09,"for doing exactly what she didwhat is the best case for capturing tyrion atmi think there is plenty of evidence to implicate a lannister because holy shit it was a lannister that through her son out a window and it was another lannister who hired a man to finish the boy and then when a man whom you trust gives you that final piece of information of course shes going to act on it what if he was guilty and she let him go he could easily have caught wind of the rumors against him and then run to casterly rock for safetydont blame cat for falling for littlefingers lies and plots shes not the only one who makes such fatal mistakes for believing littlefinger its just easier with hindsight to pin point these major turnings on her actions at the inn at the crossroads then theres sansas betrayal of ned which is always laid at her feet when it was her fathers fault in actuality"

"legba11",2011-05-09,"catelyn has often been the target of my ire in the books also so ill try to explain my thoughts on her 1 she completely abandons her 1 priority and dont try to put modern values on this they are not in play here of raising her children to seek vengeance bran is crippled rickon is an infant in the books and robb is in need of molding to become a great lord and the most important warden of the realm yet she must deliver the dagger to ned no one else could do that she went to kings landing to get her vengeance 2 she abandons winterfell and leaves it in the hands of a child moreso in the books but he is still young in the show the castle doesnt even have a steward and she takes one of the better people to assist robb with her to make matters worse 3 trust peter trust lyssa as pigheaded as ned is how different would things have turned out for the starks if she had better judgement ned is blinded by his honor and this is his weakness what is catelyns excuse these are people she knew since childhood 4 arresting tyrion we know he didnt do it well almost know she doesnt it was her son being irrational is understandable however at the end of the day you must be responsible for your actions and this is what lights the fuse for events which end with a lot of dead bodies she is not completely responsible for what follows no one is this is the one event you can point to as the event which starts the ball rolling fast enough so it couldnt be stopped 5 she releases jaime this is probably the dumbest single action in the books since viserys decided to get into a dickswinging contest with drogo everyone talks about how foolish shrill awful cersei is by book 4 compared to catelyn cersei is augustus caesar and what hardships led to catelyns flaws one bastard sired when her husband had barely known her and was at war one son permanently injured yet still very capable look at what cersei had to fight through in comparison yet she is the one who such a poor ruler"
"Fez",2011-05-09,"i absolutely adored the first 3 episodes but this one just didnt do it for me possibly the novelty of seeing the books on screen is wearing off and so im turning a more critical eye on the show or possibly i was just tired i dont know there were certainly parts that i really really liked jon sam and thorne inside littlefinger and ned walking the inn at the crossroads some others too but there was a lot that i didnt and it wasnt changes they made i dont care that petyr told the hounds story it was more the pacing this is the first time i noticed just how fast the show moves and there were far too many points where i thought okay ive read the books so i know why this happens but just going by the show there is no explanation andoh wait weve moved on to another scene already also i really wish they made the crowd bigger it would look much better and its actually quite easy and inexpensive to do all that needs to happen is they film the extras standing around cheering over and over each time standing in a different spot and then layer those takes with the actual jousting and bingo instant massive crowd that massive nazi rally crowd cheering in ian mckellens richard iii that was 50 extras plus the entire main cast standing with them filmed a couple dozen times around the stadium and it looked great wish hbo did it here this was the first time budget constraints pulled me out of the show"

"Jaimelan",2011-05-09,"i really dont get the continued comments about making characters more sympathetic how did you guys get through 4 books without learning that every narrator in asoiaf is unreliableevery wellcrafted character should be just like a real person with motivations and reasoning however flawed for doing what they do aliser thorne has always been right about sam and about the sorry state of the recruits however you always read about it tainted through the eyes of jon and his starkness we also know that aliser talks tough but doesnt actually do anything about it and sure enough the show has only shown him directing attacks against jon and scolding the recruits but never actually teaching jaime has always been the total package he is in book 3 you dont find out about his thoughts and private conversations but he obviously didnt change his opinion on why he killed aerys or how people would react or how he felt about cersei and tyrion and the kingsguard the only change jaime goes through is realizing that cersei doesnt actually love him the way he loves her and that he comes to respect brienne and you know what if he had to push an 7 year old out a window to save brienne he would you can argue that part of the fungimmick of the books is the unreliable narrator and that is lost on the show to a certain extent and you may be right but there is no way to film the povs from the book"

"The Warmth of Winter",2011-05-09,"wow pretty awesome episode actually i loved the way they showed ser hugh dying all bloody it was a nice contrast to all the grandeur and i assume a bit of an awakening to nonreaders who are watching the show it was a long time since the last gory scene so it was nicely timed i could have used a bit more action on sansas reaction but hey it was oki liked that theon finally got some screen time i loved aryas scene along with tyrions scene there was a nice buildup between jaime and jory although i dont think his name was ever mentioned and the dream sequence was awesome i did mislike littlefinger delivering sandors lines but hopefully they will still put some effort into their meeting and relationship the tourney was a bit underwhelming but i guess they can still make up for it since theres more epic stuff to come something which was really weird though was the scene before sam is beat up for the first time the guy who later hits him stands with his sword behind his back and along his shoulders and actually flexes the sword wtf are you supposed to be able to do that with a real bladei just sat there staring he did it for quite some time too and thoughtrubber rubber rubber rubber sword rubber sword rubber rubber its made of rubber shockedgif classbbcemoticon altshocked "
"Jaimelan",2011-05-09,"for doing exactly what she didwhat is the best case for capturing tyrion atm she takes him to the vale he is tried and convicted and killed yet convicted on what evidence off petyr saying it was tyrions dagger which even if it was tyrions dagger still doesnt prove a damn thing since he could have given it away or it might have been stolen what was his motivation to do so again she has no idea of the motivation eitherso in the best case he gets convicted and killed off shoddy evidence in a trial that no one outside of stark loyalists will accept and still no one would know why he did it this would clearly put them at the brink of war with the lannisters even if ned could get robert to stop an actual waryet all that is the best case scenario if he is convicted and nedrobert stop a fullblown war obviously way worse things happen she was more than a bloody moron i mean honestly how did she think this was going to work out well at all is beyond me"

as ambitious as this and drawing a total blank how it has managed to be this remarkably faithful and masterfully attentive to the sweeping and multitentacled narrative of the books is nothing of short of astounding just about every actor strikes me as an inspired choice though arya jorah and tyrion go even a step beyond that and the visuals from the wall to winterfell to the red keep are across the board perfect or as perfect as anyone could reasonably expect short of the series being bankrolled by a consortium of eccentric russian billionaires with penchants for miniature giraffes and being given a two hour time slot every week to tell the story instead of onehowever ep104 showed me perhaps the limitations of cramming the series into the unforgiving medium of tv the hands tourney ive seen folks in this thread comment in the margins about the disappointment of seeing what seems like 2030 people in the crowd for this grand tournament thats bankrupting the realm but for me it goes beyond that part of rrs motivation for writing the series was his love of and fascination with heraldry and the vivid grandeur of the high middle ages i get that the hand tourney isnt a major plot point for the series which is why in the millions of decisions the creators had to make in telling the story they could leave this aspect on the cutting room floorm both for the time and expense it would presumably take to flesh it out but to me its one of the most vivid and fanciful scenes from the first book and so incredibly important for the flavor it sets to the whole story really added so much color and vividness to this world which is so important to me to serve as contrast to the grey and unyielding bleakness of the later books if all we get is gregor killing ser hugh i can understand the decision but will feel like so much is lost in the translation as a result granted it might carry over into ep105 we might see jaime riding in his golden armor and the knight of flowers giving sansa a rose but imho the tourney couldve been a major atmospheric event for the entire second half of this episode and really a high water mark for showing us what this series is capable of instead we got robert grumbling about it taking too long to start and a crowd that runs 2 deepit felt like a not particularly well to do rennaisance faire and where the impact couldve been deep and lasting it was instead slight and almost obligatory in feel so i admit even if the tourney carries over to ep5 my expectations for the rest of it arent particularly high while the final scene of the prior episode foreshadowing the horrors of war by overlaying the sounds of steel during aryas training with syrio thought it couldve been even more effective here from neds perspective watching this fools game of knights playing at war would also be a nice contrast to sansas delight with the chivalry and wonder of it all which we also didnt really get in what was shoneanyway my intent isnt to belabor the point this was in my view the first misstep in a truly amazing adaption it just gives me pause with regard to how the series may handle the future battles we all know are on the horizon i admit i do want to have it all the political intrigue and character growth which the series has excelled at and the epic feel and the grand visuals to really highlight what is at stake i understand this may not be possible practically but it doesnt stop me from desiring it all the same at this point if it ends up feeling smaller than the books ill see that as almost inevitable and still be completely appreciative for what theyve done but if it does manage to capture some of that grand feel if the tourney turns out to not be emblematic of what the series is capable that will be absolute gravywell theres definitely going to be more of the tournament ive seen the footage and if it is what i think it is well see loras et al next week otherwise there were some limitations absolutely i thought the tourney would be one of the scenes that could not possibly live up to the bookand i guess i called it i agree with most of your points  you know the wonder of the banners flapping in the wind and the pomp and circumstance contrasted by some poor kid who got mixed up with a nest of vipers taking on a murderous lunatic while sansa watches his blood pump out of him i think they could have cut the viserys scene and added more of the tourney but i understand why they did so by the time he gets his crown were supposed to like drogo and despise viserys the only problem is that harry lloyd is such a good looking dude my gf doesnt want him to well you know tonguegif classbbcemoticon altp "

"Alexia",2011-05-09,"i really enjoyed the episode my heart softened slightly towards sam  i still dont care much for the character but i do like the way the actor is portraying him that being sad my sympathy was definitely with thorne during his speech after he realized that they were protecting sam for sansa during this period in the books she and joffrey still werent speaking he was still angry with her and finally decided to talk to her again after loras gave her the rose out of a strange and perverse sense of possessiveness imo so its true to the books and i like the way the way the character has been adapted her conversation with septa mordane about joffrey and potential children was a pretty nice addition count me in the group that is disappointed that lf took sandors lines but im reserving a final opinion until i see how they handle that relationship viserys is by now my favorite character in the adaptation i loved the expression on his face when daenerys threatened to have his hands cut off hes got this great mix of utterly pathetic and completely loony going on i liked the scene with doreah too once again i loved the scene where catelyn arrested tyrion my head hurts from one catelyndebate too many but i will say that dinklage did a great face and i cheered for her as i did in the books and at the least it is the match that lights up a great story theres very little i didnt like about this episode  it may be my favorite to date and since i didnt comment in last weeks thread didnt get to see the episode until friday ill add that i love robert he and viserys are the two characters i really disliked in the books but they just light up the screen watching him bully jaime and poor lancel was hilarious ill miss both those characters next season"
"Ran",2011-05-09,"catelyn tried to hide from him both in the book and the show they try to be inconspicuous why because neither of them wants to seize tyrion but neither of them want him to know he was there that they were on their way back from kings landing that catelyns hands are crippled by knife wounds because in the worst case scenario in which tyrion really did try to kill bran hes going to take that info run to kings landing tell the other lannisters that the attempt to kill bran probably didnt go off cleanly probably in fact failed and that the starks know something is up and ned stark may be waiting to spring the assassins confession or some other proof at any moment so they need to move now before stark knows what hit himabandoning her family bs they have guards servants a maester and high thick walls up in winterfell its ned and the girls that needed her most who didnt know just how dangerous their situation might be both in going to kings landing and in seizing tyrion catelyn was doing nothing but thinking about how to best serve her family"

"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-09,"i really dont get the continued comments about making characters more sympathetic how did you guys get through 4 books without learning that every narrator in asoiaf is unreliableevery wellcrafted character should be just like a real person with motivations and reasoning however flawed for doing what they do aliser thorne has always been right about sam and about the sorry state of the recruits however you always read about it tainted through the eyes of jon and his starkness we also know that aliser talks tough but doesnt actually do anything about it and sure enough the show has only shown him directing attacks against jon and scolding the recruits but never actually teaching jaime has always been the total package he is in book 3 you dont find out about his thoughts and private conversations but he obviously didnt change his opinion on why he killed aerys or how people would react or how he felt about cersei and tyrion and the kingsguard the only change jaime goes through is realizing that cersei doesnt actually love him the way he loves her and that he comes to respect brienne and you know what if he had to push an 7 year old out a window to save brienne he would you can argue that part of the fungimmick of the books is the unreliable narrator and that is lost on the show to a certain extent and you may be right but there is no way to film the povs from the booki fully agree with this we dont see the full personalities of a lot of people since we only see them through someone elses eyesser alliser is an ass which definitely comes across in the show but hes an ass that knows that must be done the old bear isnt a fool by any means and he knows what hes done by putting ser alliser in his position the wall is a hard place whats beyond far harder you dont achieve anything by coddling the new recruits showing his reasoning for why hes harsh doesnt make him less of an ass it just makes him a multidimensional character instead of a plot pointas for jaime ive always felt that his life changing event didnt really alter him as a person it just made him reevaluate everything again when he killed aerys he felt like he did the right thing but no one agreed and everyone kept seeing him as someone without honor he was always strong enough to dont need anyone else so when no one wanted to understand him he just gave them what they wanted that made him arrogant selfish and at times ruthless when he is forced to reevaluate his life he realizes that his actions werent serving him as well as he had thought and he focuses on other things in his character rather than inventing them"

"Smiler",2011-05-09,"however ep104 showed me perhaps the limitations of cramming the series into the unforgiving medium of tv the hands tourney ive seen folks in this thread comment in the margins about the disappointment of seeing what seems like 2030 people in the crowd for this grand tournament thats bankrupting the realm but for me it goes beyond that part of rrs motivation for writing the series was his love of and fascination with heraldry and the vivid grandeur of the high middle ages i get that the hand tourney isnt a major plot point for the series which is why in the millions of decisions the creators had to make in telling the story they could leave this aspect on the cutting room floorm both for the time and expense it would presumably take to flesh it out but to me its one of the most vivid and fanciful scenes from the first book and so incredibly important for the flavor it sets to the whole story really added so much color and vividness to this world which is so important to me to serve as contrast to the grey and unyielding bleakness of the later books if all we get is gregor killing ser hugh i can understand the decision but will feel like so much is lost in the translation as a result granted it might carry over into ep105 we might see jaime riding in his golden armor and the knight of flowers giving sansa a rose but imho the tourney couldve been a major atmospheric event for the entire second half of this episode and really a high water mark for showing us what this series is capable of instead we got robert grumbling about it taking too long to start and a crowd that runs 2 deepit felt like a not particularly well to do rennaisance faire and where the impact couldve been deep and lasting it was instead slight and almost obligatory in feel so i admit even if the tourney carries over to ep5 my expectations for the rest of it arent particularly high while the final scene of the prior episode foreshadowing the horrors of war by overlaying the sounds of steel during aryas training with syrio thought it couldve been even more effective here from neds perspective watching this fools game of knights playing at war would also be a nice contrast to sansas delight with the chivalry and wonder of it all which we also didnt really get in what was shoneanyway my intent isnt to belabor the point this was in my view the first misstep in a truly amazing adaption it just gives me pause with regard to how the series may handle the future battles we all know are on the horizon i admit i do want to have it all the political intrigue and character growth which the series has excelled at and the epic feel and the grand visuals to really highlight what is at stake i understand this may not be possible practically but it doesnt stop me from desiring it all the same at this point if it ends up feeling smaller than the books ill see that as almost inevitable and still be completely appreciative for what theyve done but if it does manage to capture some of that grand feel if the tourney turns out to not be emblematic of what the series is capable that will be absolute gravyi had the exact same thoughts after viewing ill see how it goes next week but im not overly confident it will pay off with the handling of the tournament so far im concerned the greenfork battle is going to look like a skirmish between 1020 people the acting is great in this series which in a character driven series is the most important part i think most of the dialogueplot choices so far have made perfect sense and have not deviated from the books in any significant way my biggest complaints arekings landing set  kings landing doesnt feel like the sprawling kings landing to me its too clean too small the interiors look way too much like a set especially with lighting behind the stainglass windows etc the wall and winterfell look great to me thoughnot gritty enough  theres something about the lighting that has a cheap made for tv quality again i think the north looks good but kings landing and the dothraki look too clean and the lighting is too bright the dothraki people look way too clean and i dont think they portray the savageness that they do in the books the exras in kings landing look way too neat and clean as well i can remember an interview where george said he wanted to write medieval the way it should be with dirty rushes dogs scrambling for scraps on the floor etccostumingheraldry  the costumes look good for the most part but i think they missed an opportunity to show another thing that really sets this series apart everyone is too graybrown the series needs more color if i didnt read the books i dont think i could tell you the difference between the kingsguard and the city watch or the difference between any of the people in the inn when cat was rattling off her list in the inn i laughed when she kept saying things like i recognize your sigul as well because i couldnt see anyone wearing any sigul i think they purposely toned down the costumes and heraldry that martin describes but i think it was a poor choice martins descriptions are almost comic bookish but i mean that in a good way it also would help viewers keep track of who is in whos house i want to see jaimes golden armor i want to see renlys sparkling green armor and golden antlers i want the loathing to overtake me when i see the twin towers of the freys on some random soldier i want to see the bat of harrenhall i want to see each moon on ser hughs cloak turn from white to redlack of extras  small crowd at the tourney so far and the dothraki horde looks more like what dany was left with after drogos death the cities dont feel like there are a lot of people living there end of critiqueim curious to see how nonreaders are viewing the pacing both from action and plot are there enough answers are there even enough questions is the jon arryn mystery and the bran mystery enough of a hook seems like a ton of exposition telling not showing are we moving forward in plot quickly enough as with the book i think the series should really start to take off with the abduction of tyrion my wife is a nonreader but shes staying somewhat interested but i dont get the feeling she is amazed yet i keep telling her that in about 2 more episodes things really start spiraling out of control i wonder if all the other nonreaders will stay interested long enough for that to happen"
"The Iceman of the North",2011-05-09,"on a rewatch i did notice that bronn remained seated at the end of the episode when tyrion got arrested given that hed already received lannister gold at this point this begs the question why was he allowed to join the posse cat forms to bring the imp north"
"Brewmaster",2011-05-09,"i wouldnt say that jaime doesnt change at all but its hardly a 180 degree turn once we get in his head he becomes more sympathetic even before he loses his hand or comes to like brienne he insults her and laughs at her at one point when hes still in chains but then her being so outside of what society accepts makes him think of tyrion and he feels bad about it and sincerely apologizes to her however brienne basically throws his apology back in his face as being worthless since hes an oathbreaker so he goes right back to being a dick to her that exchange is jaime prehandchop in a nutshell and pretty close to how hes being portrayed on tv imo he has moments of trying to connect or be a little nice but he knows how others think of him so he plays the part they expect him to"
"theMountainGoat",2011-05-09,"i have not read the topic as i usually do before commenting so much of this may well have been said before but i wanted to come in and give my thoughts anyway this episode was absolute perfection apart from three points in ascending order of irritation 1 the arrangement of the inn scene with catelyn and roderick sat about two foot from where tyrion was standing totally failed for me having them far away and making it only because of the singer shouting across to lord lannister that he sees them would have been so much better they had no chance of avoiding being seen stupid of them to even try a minor nitpick i know 2 changing the 3 on 1 jon fight scene so that it is rast grenn and pyp verses jon this one really annoyed me because it would have actually been simpler easier and quicker to do this as written because there is no actual fight having grenn and pyp stand up beside jon to make it a 3 on 3 fight shows us that jon can make friends and gives grenn and pyp a chance to shine instead we get another jon can kick some serious ass scene which weve already seen enough of 3 having littlefinger relate the hounds story to sansa not many people know this story  yeah you fucking dont for starters removing this totally changes the dynamic between sandor and sansa in my opinion and given what he does to her at the end of season two that is a pretty big thing im sure there has already been enough wailing from the sandor fans about this so i wont go on about it any more but everything else was just great 1 hodor 2 theon finally getting an introduction and it was so worth the wait great exchange between tyrion and theon 3 jory talking with jaime brilliant scene might be my favourite moment of this episode 4 dany hitting her brother and the scene with viserys in the bathtub had some great exposition well delivered too 5 the hands tourney ser hughs death was extremely well done  although i do hope part two of the tourney will be next week but i somehow doubt it mia loras tyrell oh and beric dondarrion too 6 if ghost had not made an appearance to scare rast i might have thrown something through my tv screen so glad to see that white beast finally on screen  though i would imagine a lot of tv viewers are wondering how the hell he got there 7 the scene with alliser thorne talking about his experiences north of the wall was great but i so dont like him being anything other than a caricature of a petty evil sadistic trainer to our heroes how dare he have human motivations and experiences to make you think he just wants whats best for the nights watch after all 8 i think ros may have got more mentions this episode than anyone else"

"Prince of Dinas Emrys",2011-05-09,"smiler i find those all very reasonable and wellreasoned critiques most of the answers are rooted i suspect in two unavoidable aspects of this production 1 budget and 2 hbos desire to present the show as adult as opposed to adolescent farebudget accounts for the lack of extras the inaccuracy of the costuming and the claustrophobicstudio set feel of kings landing costumes for example are pricey and the designer appears to be using stock materials that are more readily available than the specialized finery depicted in the novelsi predict that a few years from now some computer graphics whizkid will be hired by hbo to enhance the whole series with cgi additions in order to make a very special got special edition  with expanded crowds accurate heraldry and sigils and more spacious city and castlescapes in the meantime well have to use our own imaginations to flesh out those aspects into the truly awesome and incredibly expensive scope described in the books for nonreaders this stuff doesnt matter one iota and we readers already have it imagined just so in our heads so i for one have no problem continuing to simply imagine an overlay of correct costuming set design and massive crowds over the otherwise excellent imagery the show is presenting to us2 accounts for the lack of brilliant color i think that decision is a misstep personally since the gorgeous hues martin describes are so indelibly a part of his subcreation but i can understand what i take to be the producers thinking which is that the more flashy the colors the greater the perception  however erroneous  that this is some kind of kids showas far as the lack of grit dirt and general filth i have no excuses to put forward and no idea why the producers are not reveling in this chance to show us a truly mucky westeros and essos sure we see them all taking any number of baths which appears to account for the general cleanliness but this does not explain why the dothraki are so shiny and scrubbed on the path from pentos through the dothraki sea excuses and explanations aside you make some fair observations which give even this dyedinthewool fan pause to consider the producers errors so fari had the exact same thoughts after viewing ill see how it goes next week but im not overly confident it will pay off with the handling

"Bronn Stone",2011-05-09,"i thought it worked strong enough the way it was ned looked at gendrys face and saw robert in it then told jory ten seconds later"
"Huan",2011-05-09,"in the books the mountain is larger than life here you barely get a sense of how big he isall they had to do was show him walking past arya on his way to the joust or something to emphasize how big he isi thought he looked pretty huge next to ser hugh when they were side by side in front of the king ser hugh towered over jory in the earlier scene"
"Triskan",2011-05-09,"i thought it worked strong enough the way it was ned looked at gendrys face and saw robert in it then told jory ten seconds laterthat and hed already been looking into lineages in that book which was another hint for a viewer"

"Mazikeen",2011-05-09,"costumingheraldry  the costumes look good for the most part but i think they missed an opportunity to show another thing that really sets this series apart everyone is too graybrown the series needs more color if i didnt read the books i dont think i could tell you the difference between the kingsguard and the city watch or the difference between any of the people in the inn when cat was rattling off her list in the inn i laughed when she kept saying things like i recognize your sigul as well because i couldnt see anyone wearing any sigul i think they purposely toned down the costumes and heraldry that martin describes but i think it was a poor choice martins descriptions are almost comic bookish but i mean that in a good way it also would help viewers keep track of who is in whos house i want to see jaimes golden armor i want to see renlys sparkling green armor and golden antlers i want the loathing to overtake me when i see the twin towers of the freys on some random soldier i want to see the bat of harrenhall i want to see each moon on ser hughs cloak turn from white to redpretty much thisthe lack of actual sigils on coats at the inn is one of my few quibbles with this episode is that the bat of harrenhal i see on your coat no mlady i dont have no bats on me oopsthe issue of drab colours and more distinctive costumes is something that is bothering me a bit about the series i realize that costuming is expensive but it wouldnt hurt if some of the characters changed their clothes once in a while i think catelyn has been wearing that green dress for 2 or 3 episodes now one thought was that they could perhaps use the same costume as base but overlay different accessories or fake embroidery to make it seem slightly different"
"Jojen",2011-05-09,"i dont mind hodors gray hair some people go bald early stannis some people gray early no reason hodor cant have gone prematurely gray as for the lf telling sansa about the hounds secret while i agree they should have had sandor tell her himself it serves a secondary purpose by pointing out the hypocracy of the chivalrous knight and using it to burst sansas bubble over it although granted she hasnt exactly been swooning over them like in the book but i think she likely still comes to this understanding on her own its as much about knights in general as it is about the hound"
"PestilencE",2011-05-09,"this episode had a different writeri dont know if it was that or just the decision to cram in a lot of backstory infodumps and westeros history and too little happening but the episode was rather weak for mei had the exact same thoughts after viewingi dont know whom youre quoting but i had the exact same thoughts as you and him as wellthe budgets restrictions were bearable up to this point but the tourneys well half of it overall blandness was especially hard to accept"

"Mad Sweeney",2011-05-09,"one detail about extras  iirc the production has noted that the tourney sequence had the greatest number of extras and crew involved of any other scene they did in the showone thing about the extras they suck putting aside the fact that theres too few of them if you actually wash them theyre just awful realize though that being an extra is a demoralizing menial task that i cant understand why theyd want to do it i work in filmtv and they just get treated like crap bossed around paid low yelled at for making noise during takes and yet theyre absolutely essential to create any feeling of realism watch the scene with jon fighting apologies i cant remember which time but somewhere in this episode the two guys right behind them are barely going through the motions and are just trying to not make noise with their swords thereve been many examples of this like dothraki people skinning a critter and stirring cookpots it drives me nuts i understand why these people fail at an impossible task but after the first take with the idiots behind jon the director shouldve moved some people in there that dont look like theyre about to start giggling eta i realize too that most of them are locals to ireland and arent all necessarily professional extras it wouldnt surprise me if many of them are first day on a set unlike the hordes of pros that are in la waiting for their big break if hbo is cutting so much for budget reasons i doubt theyre bringing up experienced background actors so i am quite sure most of them are localsas i said also there just arent enough extras for the grandeur of the books this effect can be lessened by camerawork and direction but theyve failed often at that as well the tourney certainly but in more mundane areas too like everywhere not in a closed room take the entrance shot of ned getting to kl theres a high shot that goes towards the gate and there are peasants looking up and walking towards the group but theres like a force field at the edges of the shot and you can just tell that there are no other people around on the periphery of the shot i understand the budgetary concerns but imo theres a lot of sloppy filmmaking going on here and it really irks me edited by mad sweeney 09 may 2011  0943 pm"

"Jaime L",2011-05-10,"if theyre showing gregors joust with the knight of flowers they have to show beric dondarrion vs thoros of myr  theyve name dropped thoros already and both become important lateragreed considering how important both are later infact i wouldve liked to see the preamble to the tourney  the buzz and pageantry that must surround such an event id have liked to see beric riding into town with his retinue saying hes here to win the hands tourney this should feel like a city alive with possibility really show us what the kingdom was like in peace so we can appreciate the proper horror of the kingdom at war we know winters coming but less us enjoy this bit of summerthink its possible to be so gravely and intently focused on hitting all the crucial plot points and really the series hasnt missed one yet that you place less of an emphasis on those little touches that add to the vibrancy of the series"
