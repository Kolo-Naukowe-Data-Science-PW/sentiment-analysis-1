"Xray the Enforcer",2012-05-22,"continue discussion of ep 208 remember keep it classy and civil"
"Pellaeon",2012-05-22,"good episode i love the tyrion bronn varys part but the robb talisa part was boring"
"Rockroi",2012-05-22,"from the prior threadi hated that they gave robb the lines that eddard is supposed to have told him about a man being brave when he is afraid ok they left the lines out from the discussion between brandon and eddard at the beginning it is shame but i can live with it but giving this to robb talking to this random volantene is just wrongi actually thought that this worked just to point out the obvious the show has the luxury that martins pov system did not namely adding firsthand context to robbs embarrassingly bad decision to reneg on the betrothal here the show wants to give us more facetime with robb and they want to paint robb as the decent honorable and courageous leader with a streak of romanticism instead of having a relatively simplistic story of robb vbeing wounded and then bedded and then of course having to marry that woman who boffd him this story has a more gradual movement slowly and surely these two people continue to grow together and inexorably find a bond and to do that you need those moments of honesty and revelation ie i am revealing to you something deeply personal please do not betray by trust in doing so having robb talk about ned his father to a woman he obviously loves works in that context i dont think its a failure at all but a very good rearrangement of neds wisdom and its a good excuse to show how ned still influences his children as is the whole robbvolantene romance she is becoming his personal ros nowcant agree first roz is a wholly invented character while the volanese woman is a representation of jayne and is replacing her roz does not replace anyone while roz is basically a catchall to give us context to scenes we otherwise would have no link to she is a relatively empty space she adds nothing to the story and provides no insight the volanese woman meanwhile is a deeply effecting character to the story as she and robb are slowly meandering down the path to certain disaster this has huge ramifications but its more in the series we have the opportunity to actually meet robb and interact with him in the books we knew him only second hand through cat and to a much lesser degree through bran martin has said several times that if he had it to do all over again he would have given robb a pov okay with that said robbs love must seem genuine and real or its a failure robb cannot just get married offstage as he did in the book and just explain it away after the fact no we are now with robb so if he suddenly marries a foreign woman  well we better know a reason why that reason why must be real and genuine to me the show has done a very good job of making that relationship seem genuine by contrast nothing about roz feels real she is grossly tacked on to the show and is only there to provide a placeholder so the audience knows what is going on and  and it does not help that the actress playing roz is  decent but not very good ie if you are going to have a scene where a character cries the actress may actually want to actually cry also he was terrible to catelyn much more than is the bookswell theres a reason for that in the books robb confronts cat after robb himself has fucked up and married jayne so he knows that he needs top forgive cat to get her forgiveness and help also in the books cat frees jaime after she is told bran and rickon are dead i think the show is rushing the cat storyline in an attempt to take timepressure off the next season sos is a huge book as i have stated before a certain pair of weddings take place at page 585 and 684 respectively thats appx 23 of the way through the books we still have another 300 pages to go after that therefore robbs words seem more cruel because he does not have the mitigating circumstance of his mother having to mourne bran and rickon he is free to be more honest with her on her horrible act again cats actions lose so much empathy because they were done without the context of bran and rickons deaths that is a harder sell and robb is not bound to be kinder to his mother without it"
"legba11",2012-05-22,"i forgot to add my killed the thread post in mk i have they just thrown lf knowing about arya out the window they have this great scene with a significant plot development and then it just disappears in a puff of smoke"
"insertname",2012-05-22,"the same can be said of tywin if he did know she was aryai assume this wasnt the case why leave her with gregor but if he didnt know exactly who she was why did he make no move to find out who she is there arent exactly many northern highborn girls running around ready to be captured so tywin should at least be a bit intrigued who she isbut nope"
"legba11",2012-05-22,"he clearly did not know lf even tested his knowledge when he lf found it out with his comment about daughterssss i loved how tywinarya ended it was a meaningless arc plotwise but developed both characters better than martin ever did and it ended perfectly after weeks of soulful conversations clearly a bond forming tywin casually tosses arya into the meat grinder because she serves no purpose for tywin lannister that moment so perfectly defines his character with 5 seconds of effort he could have put her in a good position working somewhere decent in harranhal or even dispatching her with a couple of peon guards to moat caitlin for a small ransom she is a northern highborn but no its not worth that 5 seconds of effort so he gives her to the worst human being on the planet lf however did know who she is he also knew tywin did not know i dont understand how he would leave harrenhal without such a valuable commodity its like seeing a copy of detective comics 1 at a yard sale and not paying the 2 they are asking for it i understand that storywise they cant let lf get her because her story doesnt go that way but we should have seen lfs plot to grab her get foiled"

"Grey Robb",2012-05-22,"regarding tyrion and the chain or lack thereof i put a few context clues together from the varystyrionbronn banter and i believe they are scraping the chain entirely in favor of another method i think tyrion the highborn plumber of casterly rock will devise some scheme with flushing rather than flinging a majority of the wildfire into the waters of blackwater rush the scene with bronn shooting the fire arrow made it seem as though he could have been using it to set the contaminated river ablaze i still think they will probably fling some wildfire and use ships full of wildfire as battering rams but i think the crux of the plan will be the river itself not necessarily as ingenious as the chain but it serves the same purpose of trapping and eviscerating stannis fleet its probably a lot more budget conscious as well and would still be creditable to tyrions ingenuity just a thought"

"legba11",2012-05-22,"well see i can visualize a fading tyrion looking up seeing loras in the green armor which we saw plenty of and a stag helm which we have not seen and mumbling renly as he passes out and the credits roll i agree that they have not waved the armor in in our faces like rozs nipples but i would be surprised if they pass up on a moment like that ive been wrong before and will be again about the show after the past two episodes i have no idea what theyre doing at this point so"

"Currawong",2012-05-22,"agree with rockrois posts above the writers have had to condense and streamline so much anyway plus they were also faced with the task of bringing certain key people onto our screens where they are absent from the book acok robb in particular does not get a pov in the book but because they have to show him onscreen they can hardly have characters sitting down and expounding at length about what hes done they have to make some changes that allow them to show robb but in a condensed and meaningful way the real guts of the robb  talisajeyne story is that robb is betrothed to a frey girl but because he has sex with another woman he decides it is honourable to marry her and thus he betrays his vows to the freys as long as the writers can show that critical element leading into series 3 then i couldnt care less if they have talisa rather than jeynesimilar to catelyn not knowing that cersei had a son who died last season you can come up with explanations but the simplest one is sloppy writing get realistic its not sloppy writing at all  why on earth would catelyn married to ned and way up north in winterfell for all those years and concerned with her own family know or care anything about what was happening to queen cersei in kl as far as having babies went shes hardly on good terms with cersei anyway"

"Lyana",2012-05-22,"nice episode despite the lack of action the show obviously is slowing down before the finale grande i liked all the scenes in general here are some impressions in order of appearance  i actually didnt have much to say about asha until now because ive just had started to read affc but now im nearly half into the book and have to admit that asha is becoming one of my favourites thus the big interest ive had about the ashatheon scenes this is the first time we see her in her true light the actress has captured the essence of the character and the interaction with alfie was great we get too see how the different perception of the ironmen can turn the captives into brave children i enjoyed very much the emphasis on how different the points of view of asha and theon are and yet they are still btother and sister and there exists some connection between them as little as it is the ashatheon interaction was one of the highlights of this episode imo  im relieved to see a nice setup abot the big jon scene coming in episode 10 im glad were going to see him killing qhorin after all about the issue how jon is represented in the second season ill discuss it further in another thread the big problem here still remains  where the f is ghost how are the going to think of some plausible explanation that he is gone all the time loved the scenes on the fist too the shots in iceland are breathtaking  ive seen that the scenes with robb caused a huge discussions in this thread and there are many posts about this so i wont go in details my confusion about the jeynetalisa story comes from a memory i have about reading an article of the cast decisions few months ago ive read somewhere that they have casted oona chaplin for the role of jeyne westerling so i really thought at some point she will be revealed as jeyne after watching this episode im not so sure about this anymore but its fine by me if she remains talisa i see what are they trying to do here and its ok we have a beautiful lovestory and a great chemisrty between the actors they have been made so lovable that while watching the love scene i had tears in my eyse for knowing what is going to happen in next season robbs story line works for me so far  in this episode we have a nearhighlight where i see a potential to become one of the highlights at the end of this season and the beginning of the next one i find the jaimebrienne interaction particularly funny and cant wait to see more of that  well the way aryas story was handled was a bit surprising but as long as the coingiving is shown im fine with it there was a plausible explanation for every person arya picked and her last choice was handled well in this episode will miss the weasel soup in the show but eh what are you going to do  it is not the end of the world the passing through the gate with all the dead lannister guards was creepy enough i see the writers have something in mind since the name of episode 10 is valar morghulis i will miss the aryatywin interactions though those were the best  tyrions scenes were the best moments in this episode im extremely happy about seeing varys again missed him very much and was annoyed by the constant showing of lf the tyrionvarysbronn scene was particularly funny and i enjoyed it very much nice actintg of lena headey too ive been waiting to see that evil little smile of hers since the teaser came out a few months ago also it was a pleasant surprise to see the red keep during the varystyrion conversation have almost forgotten that they are in kl the place looked different form kl in season one it was a nice refreshing detail  the davosstannis conversation was one of my favourite moments in this episode stephen dillane is growing into his character with every episode and this was his highlight we were forgotten  all the bitter dissapointment about not being appreciated by his brother was overwhelming and i nearly felt it myself the cats and dogsline was hilarious  not really much to say about danys little scene still waiting for the hou  last episode and this episode both ended with something that was thought to be a twist i suppose i didnt really feel the tension as in the books i watched it both times with my boyfriend a nonbook reader by the end of episode 7 he was sure that bran and rickon are alive and those burned bodies belonged to someone else but during episode 8 his certainty was shaken and before the end he was already convinced the boys were actually dead then the final scene came and had an impact on him  he was really relieved his reaction made me appreciate those final scenes more as some kind of twist overall i liked this episode very much but now cant wait to see the highlight of the season next week"

"rmholt",2012-05-25,"there is no riverrun in the show so there is no plot reason for tywin to go in one direction just to turn around and there isnt time for him to do it either there is a leaked casting video for season 3 where spoiler edmure is getting dressed down like he does in the book but its for holding up the mountain not tywin so its going to happen later in a slightly different way as part of introducing the tullys robb is still at the crag so it would make sense that tywin would head that way and then turn around when word of kl arrived however i am not sure the crag has been associated in the show with a threat to casterly rock in fact i cant recall if the reason for the march on the crag was given on tv now i am confused"
"Arbor Gold I'm Sold",2012-05-25,"tywin doesnt get there right when stannis does if you remember there was some fighting for awhile before tywin gets there so he might have more than a day to get thereand i am not suggesting that he lies to his war generals he might have thought that robb was closer than he is robb might have move further away so they deside to head to kings landing there are all sorts of things that could happen in order for tywin to show up in kings landinghowever even if he does not which i highly freaking doubt how is that going to some how stop the entire red wedding just because tywin marches against robb that does not mean he kills robb for all we know tywin could fight some of robbs army and robb can be with the other part or robb could make tywin retreat etc etcwatch that scene again tywin never says he is marching against robb he says he wants to get a march in before robb knows what he is doing he doesnt say what direction that march is going to be in its a misdirection for the nonbookreaders so he can turn up at kl by surprise i just rewatched it i can see where you have some points here they were just setting it up with him seeming to come to the conclusion that he was marching on robb they did it quite heavy handed i think though unless some scouts show up right as tywin is leaving harranhal to say robb is falling back to riverrun i guess my biggest problem was the scene was set with his small council i wish they could have maybe said it with another character other than tywin with the generals i think the scene with arya telling jquen hagar that tywin is leaving and going to march on her brother easily got the point across ill give them credit it pissed me off and they got me even though i new the story probably more so because i new the story"

"legba11",2012-05-25,"she does it publicly because thats how they do things she still wants to ensure he knows she is his superior but she wants him to make it as an ironborn she has given him good advice just not in a way where theon is willing to listen to it besides she has to make it clear she tried to get him to leave so she doesnt get blamed for it when he dies she likely doesnt know their father will react to that"

"Died a Hero",2012-05-20,"my 1st 10 easily the best showing of asha her exchange with theon was amazing then stannis and davosmy god not only informative for the nonbook readers but powerfully delivered the first real stannis moment imo i like dogs theyre loyal i liked that they left tyrion and cerseis conversation alone it was one of the best from the novel and to change it in anyway would be not only unnecessary but completely damagingthe stuff between him and bronn was funny too the back story of talisa was well done im still not sure why theyve changed her in the first place but oona chaplin is great in the role and is beyond hot the king of bones looked great and im fine with how the found the dragon glass stash the only thing that sucked was still no chain and no weasel soup but thats not going to lower the score on what was easily the best episode of the season and the promo for next weeks episode looks beyond epic"
"WinterWarrior",2012-05-20,"definitely a 10 an excellent espisode i was so happy to see branrickon hodorosha and luwin in the crypts at the end ashas strongest appearance i think talisa is still jeyne and somehow her relationship with robb made more sense to me this episode and cersei is her horrible self with ros playing the alayaya role as we suspected the set up for her to accuse tyrion of the purple wedding is underway excellent excellent i think i will stay up long enough to watch it again at 10pm central love it"
"teemo",2012-05-20,"okay asha was good this episode and that surprised me i liked this episode because soooo much dialogue was just pulled straight from the books and i could almost predict every scene what was going to happen i think the lack of dany makes an episode better as well she was there but thankfully it was short and bad jeynetalisa is also terribleworst character in the series imo loved how the handled a lot of stuff thought that they have handled poorly in the past and we got to see some of cerseis viciousness finally"
"boojam",2012-05-20,"a ten again  still just for cast and production values next week looks redeeming whew tho i hope benioff and weiss learn from this season if the actors were not so good and individual scenes not so well played out this would be a train wreck of continuity even if the source material did not exist there has to be a smoother way  last season was so much better well at least arya got to pull her trick i was not surprised by the loss of weasel soup but was surprised that we did not see jaqen in action solving their problem so its dany and the dragons again to end a season i cant see how that can come next week"
"summer_stark",2012-05-20,"yes asha was great this episode i really liked her and i was glad they had the boys double back  thats what i was hoping would happen but thought it was a small chance love that theyre in the crypts still though where the fuck is ghost no one can tell me with any logic whatsoever that ghost wouldnt come and kill people as soon as jon is captured  they sense danger for their masters no sense whatsoever glad samgrenn found the dragon glass though"

"Patchface12",2012-05-20,"i was not happy with the robbjeyne romance and was pissed that there was no weasel soup maybe jaqen rorge and biter will be fleeing with them for a time i dont think jaqen killed all those guards by himself giving them a chance for a final exchange a coin and perhaps a face change how will they make that look convincing with their budget tho i was glad they finally made good use of ros as a standin for alyaya i noticed this is the third time in the show theyve used material from a dance with dragons for their script 710 for me hopefully next weeks episode will be better martin is scripting it"

"gogorath",2012-05-20,"not sure have to watch it a second time my first impulse is that while the cerseityrion team was great overall it wasnt a great episode im less confident the jon storyline will be as good as the book  as much as i like getting ygritte early and while im not overly worried about losing weasel soup i thought they could have drawn that out better well see if i like it better at the 9pm pst showing"

"zippypoodle",2012-05-20,"i gave it an 8 overall i liked it but i took it down one point for talisajeynes long boring story i also took it down another point for arya not killing a guard herself on the way out i dont really mind not getting weasel stew because we did get her giving jaqen his own name but i really wanted to see arya escape herself i love that ros took the place of alayaya as the misidentified whore just waiting for the rabidantiros howls to start and anyone who was worried about jons storyline should be pacified now they are clearly setting up jon to have to kill qhorin on qhorins orders and not because hes in love with ygritte danys storyline is set up wellhope the hotu ends up being epic i was a bit annoyed that robb fucked jeynelisa and cat freed jaime without finding out about the deaths of bran and rickon especially since it would have been so easy just to let one damn raven through but in the big picture it really doesnt matter and is not a substantive change i also am enjoying the briennejaime interaction those two are going to play off each other really well and sam finding the obsidian is a good twist on the novel while keeping to the spirit of events"

"Eira Seren",2012-05-21,"we gave it an 8 like last weeks episode this was one of the better episodes this season i give last weeks a 9 im not in love with the romance stuff with robb though a portion of it is certainly believable and i really enjoy jons interations with ygritte rose leslie is really holding her own tyrion any scene with tyrion is almost totally brilliant i like that he is finally interacting more with varys and thought that tyrions annoyance with bronn was amusing some great emotional intensity in all of tyrions scenes these three work well togetherrolled my eyes a little during the dany scene just par for the course this season i guess we didnt see dany nursing the dragons last season for some reason though i thought maybe that had been implied at least so jorahs line about her not nursing them seemed strange it will be nice to see the house of the undying   if we ever get therearyas scenes were pretty good enjoyed her exchange with jaqen the look on his face when she names him he really landed itone thought i do have in a season that draws from source material that doesnt have as much action what drives the decision to cut some of the still usefull to tvplot existing action while i appreciate the time we spent with ygritte last episode i find myself pondering the two ways the scenes with jon are panning out1 the wildling girl you couldnt kill makes a quick getaway theres a short chase followed by tying her up she grinds her hips against yours then you exchange some banter and have a stroll through beautiful scenery followed by another quick escape only to discover she has outwitted you and you are ambushed later you discover your companions have all been killed your leader also captured and now the two of you plot to try and outwit them while taking another stroll through beautiful scenery in fairness the season isnt done yetspoiler2 in trekking in the general direction of the wildling girl you captured and let go hoping she doesnt alert your enemy to your presence before you can find them you discover youve been marked and wisely high tail it back the way you came your leader with precise thinking says if you are captured you must yield and no matter what make them believe you are breaking your vows so as to turn spy grudgingly you agree despite your attempts to outrun them you find yourselves cornered theres the girl youve been secretly thinking about her admit it and a bunch of the enemy you follow the plan switch sides they want you to prove it and now your commander rushes you with his sword playing a brilliant worthyoftyrion handi think a great deal of 1 worked well on screen especially considering time constraints and theres the added bonus of the grinding hips yet once my professor asked where is the action in a victorian novel mostly its in the dialogue and the sex is in the little details like the sleeve that rides up and reveals the bare forearm like i said i enjoy the dialogue and much of it contains action however sometimes i wish this season felt a little less like pride and prejudice and a little more like got edited by eira seren 21 may 2012  0314 am"
"insertname",2012-05-21,"ok i was reserving judgement until now but they officially botched harrenhal by making tywin look like a real fool why in seven hells would he just leave her there like that why does he make no connections to the assassination of amory lorch whether im happy with the arya development will be decided with the last two episodes the chain will still come dont worry oh yeah and im annoyed by the talisa storyline apart from the obvious cheesy hollywood romance how in seven hells does catelyn allow robb to act like that after she has been arrested fine but she would have put a real stop to that from the moment she found out with more than her stupid line of i wish you could follow your heart bs"
"JW.",2012-05-21,"610 half of it was good the other half was just subpar as usual for this season why release jaime if they still think branrick are alive it really makes little sense robb and talisa a romance plot straight out of a bad ashton kutcher romantic comedy harrenhall was fine this episode atleast no last second assassinations jon and ygritte liking it so far luckily we see the halfhand is still alive and we be seeing that amazing scene later on rose leslie is one of those actrices who has improved on the books character she is more likeable and still fierce and independant stannis and davos good scene aswell although i still think that stannis is a bit to like able dany what a load of sappy sht i had to skip through most of it so many of these scenes are just going nowhere at all i started disliking the character around adwd but the creators of the show have managed to do so by the second season already quite the accomplishment dinklage is the best part of the episode as always oh and cersei finally is being like cersei like nice i have been waiting eight episodes for those scenes and they finally decided to show us one and it certainly didnt disapoint"

"The hairy bear",2012-05-21,"710 imho the problem with this episode was that it had to make up for the shortcomings of the previous ones i think its too late to have a scene explaining stannis background and why he was at odds with robert or a scene with robb remembering his father or to introduce talisas background those scenes would have worked fine in previous episodes but all together in a a single hour felt contrieved still the scene between tyrion and cersei was pure gold one of the best actings from peter and lena so far"
"TC_Chaos",2012-05-21,"810 this episode was kind of boring its kind of hard to enjoy when you already know the plot the last two scenes of dany and bran were emotional so it was a good ending for the episode well next episode is gonna gonna have the most action so well all see i guess"

"Greyjoy67",2012-05-21,"710 for me and i gave the last two episodes 9s basically in building up for blackwater it seems like theyre giving that episode all the big climaxes they could have shifted qhorins death to this episode or dany finding her dragons to this episode or stannis finally approaching the gates there needed to be a more dynamic shift in the plot because this one just dragged and felt very flat compared to the last two i thought the series was really shifting up a gear but nah im sure the next two will lift the excitement levels but this feels like an opportunity lost good stuff ashas scene with theon cerseis whore scene ros wasnt even irritating in it stannis and davos talisas backstory okay its not in the books and yeah shes absolutely gorgeous but it was nicely delivered the short excerpt we got from jaime and brienne not so good stuff why was the jaimebrienne excerpt so short more please longer scenes longer scenes all round how much cutting do you need daenerys wasnt really needed in this episode  that two minute stint was a waste also can they name roose bolton by name please and at least give the brotherhood some screentime doesnt need to be long and they wouldnt need to introduce a multitude of characters necessarily weasel soup out is a shame its pretty fun in the book if not essential whatever way they did it its a disappointing end to the arya in harrenhal arc i think all that build up with her hanging round the castle for like four episodes but she then just walks out hmmmmm still a high standard of acting as always blablabla but this one did not get things moving as well as the last two episodes hopefully its just an interlude as disappointing as that sounds"

"ipsuel",2012-05-21,"disagree about robb and talisa the show version to me makes him seem like an even bigger selfish idiot at least in teh books he was wounded and had just learned about bran adn rickon so it made sense that he succumbed to temptation here he admits he doesnt want to marry a frey and then just sleeps with her after she tells a long story about her drowning brotherwhat gets me is that they still tried to play the vulnerableemotionally charged cuz were talking about the death of a little boy card i mean wtf why not just go wthe original robb is vulnerable they could leave out the wounded and she helped him cope wbran and rickon being killed why are they changing things for ultimately no reason"
"The Anti-Targ",2012-05-21,"too many scenes that didnt quite work for me probably most disappointingly brienne and jaime there didnt seem to be any chemistry nikolaj seeme to be going through the motions with his delivery i blame the direction because nikolaj has delivered some great lines these past 2 seasons though thats their first scene together an perhaps there will be a chance for the chemistry to develop its an important relationship for jaime so i guess some stark loyalists will need to capture jaime in order for him to lose his handor will it be the brotherhood jaqen and arya will need to have one more scene so arya can unsay his name i expect well see the coin and the face change thenwed better or aryas story will go 100 off the tracks i didnt like the lead up to naming a man for death it shouldnt have been jaqen refusing to kill tywin regardless of the reason arya should have opened with the i need your help line i suppose they are rescuing jon and qhorins story arc a bit i still think its crazy that ghost has gone completely awol but i do have a personal need for qhorin to tell jon what must be done the show also put the brakes on the season slowing down the pace which didnt quite work for me i did think tyrion and cersei worked well and theon  asha was good we all knew robb  talisa was coming so it was what it was i think they got that entire thing wrong but the error was in the original decision so what happened this episode is neither good nor bad it just is the next logical step most of what happened in winterfell was fine robb  catelyn was ok i do think it was a cop out not showing the manner of the escape too much suspension of disbelief required to think they could slip out of the camp unnoticed for long enough for them to get a decent head start i dont know whay they didnt have jaimes captivity based based at riverrun given they marched right past it to get to the westerlands its not like hoster tully would ever cave in to promises of gold for jaime bad choice and i cant think hiring another castle would be more expensive than having it all happen in an encampment great to see varys back in the picture and good interactions with tyrion ros being used as the mistaken whore expected and played well 1 12 minutes of dany and nothing really happens pointless i was happy with stannis and davos even though the scene was really only to remind the audience that theyre there it sounds like i have mostly bad things to say about the show but overall i still liked it well enough time is precious with only 10 episodes per season i feel somewhat cheated by having previously on got eating up 2 minutes of airtime thats 20 minutes of potential extra show content over the season lost from doing previouslies  not that this is unique to this episode but i just havent felt like expressing it before 710"

"Kvothe the Arcane",2012-05-21,"people need to calm down and judge the show in the long run yes it is irritating at times when they omit what we see as important character developments but we do not know for sure yet if they have not just moved them remember that arya murdering a guard could easily happen in season 3 of the show which quite frankly they will need to beef out as they cannot do a whole series of her in the wilderness before meeting beric they can easily have a scene where arya kills a lannister scout or to that effect i am not a particular fan of talisa mostly as the name tulisa is just polluted in my mind as synonymous with terrible music other british people will know what im saying but she is still fulfilling the role of jeyne westerling from the books as long as the role is fulfilled in the general character arc ie robb betraying the freys then i think it is fine i mean jeyne or the westerlings were hardly the most important characters the importance came from what robb does and the consequences of his actions i am disappointed stannis hasnt been given more screentime this season though given his importance he isnt really coming across as much of a threat even now when hes sailing the kings landing scenes were far too calm i hope they build this siege up a hell of a lot in the next episode before any fighting begins i would guess that that is their plan as any serious tension this week would be mostly forgotten in the wake of what would therefore be pointless violence all in all whilst i agree this season has not been as spectacular as the first i think its ridiculous to write the whole show off based on character story arc changes that have not been completed yet on screen judge the arc at its end not the middle edited by a knight without honour 21 may 2012  0658 pm"

"Eira Seren",2012-05-22,"lol with weasel soup that scene is completely irrelevant did any one of you actually watch the show robb starks army is all together there is no separate part of the army commanded by bolton who could come over and take harrenhall since no one can take harenhall which they would anyway soon abandon next season there is no point in lannisters losing control over it hence there is no need for stupid weasel soup arya did what she needed to do this season and that was to escape from the lannisters mission accomplished and btw entire aryas storyline in acok actually makes much more sense in the tv show compared to the book original it was too convulted with her being servant for the lannisters then orchestrating coupe to take over the castle then being cupbearer for bolton then never revealing her identity to northerners then killing her own allied soldier i know that bolton was already traitor at the time but she did not know that to escape honestly it was a mess it is easier to follow what is going on this way you know just like it should be in a freaking tv showher storyline is easier to follow maybe but thats because its not a very good storyline her narrative has been in stasis since episode 4 all those tywin scenes nothing happened in a thematic sense for her character great writing and acting exercises but not actually important the complicated narrative at harrenhal in the novels is far more interesting and has a great deal of impact on aryas developmenti agree somewhat that the simplification of the harrenhall storyline is easier to follow however is it necessary to axe all the complication do we feel that way because it is tv and therefore entertainment and should not be at all complicated because simple is nice and doesnt require anything of the viewers i recall lots of twists and turns in season 1 that worked very well and kept the suspense and tension something i think im missing this season there are plenty of opportunities they just seem to slip away for instance do any of us think that dany would dither around while someone has her dragons maybe season 1 dany who is more careful waits and plans knowing how powerless she is though is also sometimes impusive but not this seasons character whenever she doesnt get the answer she wants shes all up in peoples faces spouting some nonsense about blood and fire do we buy that maybe she is finally starting to learn btw not sure if this is the kind of complication im looking for as a viewer wonder what will occur in subsequent seasons when the writers encounter what grrm calls his problem of the meerenese knot but perhaps they can sort that out for usyou dont seriously expect a 10year old girl to slid someones throat in cold blood in american tv show do you her character will have plenty of time to become darker in 3rd season when she is a bit older and when she learns about all deaths in her family   well actually   we saw a 10 year old boy get shoved out a tower window at the end of s1e1 we saw an adolescent point a crossbow at a whore and command her to sadistically beat another woman arya begins the book series at 9 the childrens ages have been advanced for the show and arya is older than showbran hes 10 making her an adolescent in the show she has also already lost those close to her including family nymeria mycah lady jory syrio her father yoren shes seen a kid roughly her own age killed out of hand by soldiers on the road and shes also stabbed at least one boy in season 1 not to mention shes been naming names   so yes maybe i did rather expect it edited by eira seren 22 may 2012  0150 am"

"LeggoMyEssos",2012-05-24,"first time poster somewhat long time lurkerive read the books  love em as everyone here likely doeshowever a reality check  their job is to make the best tv show they can not do a framebyframe frank miller recreation of the novelsthere are two salient points that i have not seen anyone bring up and drive home in these recaps1 what makes the novels great is that no one is ever safe and you dont know whats going to happen next why would you want to watch a tv show that is the exact opposite  a totally predictable reenactment of the novels by consolidating characters altering minor story arcs and adding some nonnovel twists it can recapture some of that grmm unpredictability  if you let it i think many of you are too busy overanalyzing and being hypercritical to the point where youll never enjoy the tv show 2 by extension of 1 youre also basing all of this critcism that the tv show must and will follow the books going forward overall i believe they will  but i for one hope they keep throwing in the surprises kidnapped dragons hot battlefield nurses now and forever regarding things missing in e208  before jumping off the nearest bridge or wanting to push the writers off one perhaps consider the following jaqen is waiting a short distance outside the gates  meets arya for the coin and final resolution we share davos surprise when the chain makes its appearance robb stark is a fan favorite and needs screen time to both please the tv audience and make them emotionally invested in him so that later events become that much more powerful as great as the jon snowqh scenes were in the book they only have 10 hours total to paint the story the snowygritte story line is much more important over the long haul so it was simply more important to establish ygritte for her important arc in season 3 than it iswas to have a bromanceontherun chase through the wildernessbottom line  season 1 followed the first book nearperfectly and it was awesome but we all knew seasons 2 were going to be breaking the chains from the source material and telling the best story possible within the constraints and reality of tv that means streamlining characters resequencing events even fabricating new events to tell the story in a more concise and audiencefriendly manner to some i guess this is dumbing down from the source material to most i hope this is just basic reality at the end of the day its all subjective  you either love it or you hate it most likely somewhere in between one person can argue a decisions terrible and another can argue just as strongly why it isnt but without knowing the endgame none of us truly can say definitively writer decisions in episodes 18 that feel wrong now might make a lot more sense after viewing episodes 9 and 10 or it might even take until the 3rd season or latersorry for the long post  nah no im not "
"woweezowee",2012-05-24,"i gave it an eight i liked that they slowed down the pace and allowed in some interesting characterdeveloping scenes i also liked that they didnt try to shoehorn in a silly cliffhanger which has been a problem this scenei mostly agree with leggomyessoss articulate defence of the show particularly the point thattheir job is to make the best tv show they can not do a framebyframe frank miller recreation of the novelsive really enjoyed the series i can see why people who are extremely emotionally attached to the characters in the book might find changes difficult to accept and theres the occasional alteration which i think hasnt worked  for instance the complete change in littlefingers character has made him less interesting and his role as a wandering expositionmachine could have been better served by an entirely new character  but for the most part theyve got things right many of the best scenes this series werent in the books"
"woweezowee",2012-05-24,"one thing id add re changes from the books a common criticism of the changes made repeatedly in the reviews on this website is that they mostly make for worse not better tv the reasoning for this is often along the lines of its implausible that the character would do this or thats inconsistent with scene x or it was unnecessary for the character to do that but i think these problems are only perceived as problems by martin obsessives who scrutinise the show extremely closely a large majority of viewers simply dont care about them on spoilerfree discussion of the episodes these scenes are often praised as particularly strong and any inconsistencies waved away with a laugh take for instance the scene last episode where jaime killed his relative one response could be thats absurd he didnt need to kill him but who cares it was an exciting wellwritten scene dramatic and tense precisely because it was clear he was going to kill him it was entertaining television agot is not the wire its just entertainment and it was never going to hold up to the level of analysis some fans want to apply to it"

"Rockroi",2012-05-20,"i thought this was the most balanced and complete episode of the seasonhere is what i likedthe time taken and the time spent the best part of this episode was that it felt like every individual storyline was given the time and the space to grow and it did not feel like i was watching a â<U+0080><U+009C>meanwhileatthelegionofdoomâ<U+0080><U+009D> highlights the episode gave each part of the show the time it needed to feel real and fully formed this was maybe the only episode all season that did not feel fragmented and disjointed heck i even liked the jon snow parts the king in the north west look for reasons not entirely clear to me some viewers do not like robbâ<U+0080><U+0099>s relationship with the volantian woman but watching robb comfortably talk to another woman unlike jon who with ygritte has all the comfort of being naked on a nailbed is refreshing he seems to care about her and she seems to have a genuine affection for him or is a doubleagent when robb said he did not want to marry the frey girl not only do i believe him but i kind of sort of understand him tylesa is a complete person filled with empathy kindness bravery intelligence and decency and robb is all those things as well and if she turns out to be a doubleagent fuck thats hot wait what and before i forget i liked that when they were having sex they both laughed for once on this show sex is seen as a positive and fun event i mean its going to kill robb but hey still fun and when he unloaded on cat i was right there with him she fucked it up and she had to be told robb told her and fuck her freeing the ks was weak the siege of stormâ<U+0080><U+0099>s end and robert and renlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s brother stannis is possibly my second or third favorite character in the books handless and noseless take 1 and 2 usually and on the show he has stepped up gotten laid and nailed this part whenever he speaks you get this sense of not only his determination and raw almost pathological force of will but you can sense his emotional void how when he held robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s center he deserved not only praise but gratitude instead he got sent to dragonstone and all the while he talked about the horses and cats and dogs and the hate the hate the hate and also the unfairness one of the reasons i like stannis and one of the reasons i think the actor is hitting stannis so well is because i think we have all at one time or another known what its like to be truly treated unfairly stannis is the rightful king and his realm is the seven kingdoms period whatever robb or dead renly or tywin think matters not at all robert was king died without legal issue case closed and yet he aint the king and so that same sense of fairness that drives stannis also serves him to treat davos well it causes him to listen to wise counsel and it makes him toss aside those who are arrogant proud and wrong to me thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s why stannis works so  so the fury comes out woe be onto they who gets in that way mace tyrell renly the castellan of storms end gold cloaks mance ryder or some karstarks youve been warned fuck if i was mace tyrell id want anyone king other than stannis stannis has to be the only guy in the 7 kingdoms who kicks the shit out of you and then says want a rematch and he never blinks the actor who plays him i think has blinked like 8 times this season the jaime and brienne show now that tywin and arya has been cancelled i hope the jaime and brienne show is able to hold that time spot so far so good jaime is arrogant and infuriating brienne proud and unbending they make an amazing duo the salvation of jon snow okay so it only took them three episodes but i think the show has been able to cobble together the important bits and save jon snowâ<U+0080><U+0099>s storyline they are going to do the halfhand fight etc and it may potentially save time in the long run if thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the case than this worked out if not wellâ<U+0080> â<U+0080><U+009C>you know nothing jon snowâ<U+0080><U+009D> is going to be the worst drinking game ever the spider and the imp i got nothing â<U+0080>cept that donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need to say anything else bran a boy knowsâ<U+0080>what i am on the fence aboutthe least shocking reveal ever who didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think it was going to be roz okay i know we read it in the books and all but â<U+0080> if you made 50 people watch this show episode 1 to episode 18 and then right before she walks out ask them â<U+0080><U+009C>who is going to walk out in that roomâ<U+0080><U+009D> how many of the 50 say â<U+0080><U+009C>rozâ<U+0080><U+009D> and how many of them roll their eyes when they say it iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m going to say 32 say â<U+0080><U+009C>rozâ<U+0080><U+009D> 20 of them roll their eyes and two guys add the word â<U+0080><U+009C>fuckingâ<U+0080><U+0099> to her name now for me i was fine with it it just felt utterly unnatural the whole time and when roz walked out all i could think of was â<U+0080><U+009C>thank christ i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have to listen to shae and then the next scene had shae in it so i ran cold water in my bath tub in preparation of opening a vein but hey she was fine dany it was a pointless scene we could have had no dany this week and tacked on that scene to the week when she burns down the house of the undying and it would have been fine but what was there was fine we get it heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a moron whenever theon talks to â<U+0080> anyoneâ<U+0080> i just want him to stop and its not because heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s poorly written or poorly acted but because theon greyjoy is a car wreck and with that said its pretty much identical to him in the books so not complaining about that just â<U+0080> why does theon have to be so â<U+0080> human what i did not likefuck it was a great episode no bad things to say really just next weekâ<U+0080> i put odds of stannis dying at

"Arrogant Bastard",2012-05-20,"probably my least favorite episode of the season though most of it has to do with the things i enjoyed in the books being changed or occurring prematurely also the episode just felt really disjointed like it was moving back and forth between many storylines with very little actually happening in any of them jon snows storyline has been a pretty massive disappointment theyve sort of rendred him into a bumbling idiot and qhorin now looks pretty bad as well i almost laughed when sam mentioned qhorin as a great ranger when in the scene before hes been caught by wildings all because he let jon snow escape from him to execute ygritte and somehow couldnt find him in time great ranger my ass he has none of the mystique or presence from the books just seems to be the ranger in charge whose only purpose is now for jon to kill robb talisa just dont like these scenes at all and i really think the time could have been spent better elsewhere robb now breaks his promise to the freys because she told him some really long story about her brother drowning whatever arya jaqen was disappointing as well she decides she wants tywin dead jaqen says he cant do it so then she wants him dead then she wants to escape i dont know that all sounded really rushed and im bummed there will be no weasel soup davos and stannis i actually liked this scene as it gave some good backgrond info and characterization to both stannis and davos but i think they dropped the ball with the ending i really like the scene in a storm of swords where stannis decides to name davos his hand when it appeared he might have him executed here he just sort of mentions it offhand and im not really sure why this couldnt wait in the book stannis names him because davos always tells him the truth of what he believes here its like stannis named him because of what he did twenty years ago during the rebellion jaime brienne was fine i suppose though they didnt really do much i also think they revealed that bran and rickon were alive too early this could have been held back at least another week and i feel like they really hammered it home too much not only does theon mention it to dagmer but osha has to be seen outside the tombs and maester luwin has to visit them inside cersei tyrion scene was good though it does feel really jumbled with how theyve been portraying cersei last episode she and tyrion were confiding their thoughts to one another closely and now this episode she feels tyrion is out to kill joffrey who she basically admitted last time out she doesnt even really care for him"

"ServantOnIce",2012-05-20,"i am still upset but it is just a tv show it has to be good tv to get me so upset right lolthe reality is they have developed characters like dagmar osha and roz but they didnt develop jon and his relationship with q halfhandi do understand that they are limited for budget and time but why would jon listen to a guy he doesnt know that wellthe first season was different but they stayed faithful to the nature of the books this season they have taken to chances that are deviating or appear to be deviating away from the nature of martins songi think tonight was so disappointing to me i expected to see more than some bony pasting butts in a sex scene i expected more but there are two episodes left and i am sure some stuff will be streamlined and other things left for next seasonthe issue that i have is that the news of bran and rickons death really set a chain of events off that was in my opinion as powerful as lord eddards decapitationbut there is another season and 2 episodes left for us to see what d and d can do"
"Rickon is FIERCE",2012-05-20,"i thought this was the most balanced and complete episode of the season here is what i liked the time taken and the time spent the best part of this episode was that it felt like every individual storyline was given the time and the space to grow and it did not feel like i was watching a â<U+0080><U+009C>meanwhileatthelegionofdoomâ<U+0080><U+009D> highlights the episode gave each part of the show the time it needed to feel real and fully formed this was maybe the only episode all season that did not feel fragmented and disjointed heck i even liked the jon snow parts the king in the north west look for reasons not entirely clear to me some viewers do not like robbâ<U+0080><U+0099>s relationship with the volantian woman but watching robb comfortably talk to another woman unlike jon who with ygritte has all the comfort of being naked on a nailbed is refreshing he seems to care about her and she seems to have a genuine affection for him or is a doubleagent when robb said he did not want to marry the frey girl not only do i believe him but i kind of sort of understand him tylesa is a complete person filled with empathy kindness bravery intelligence and decency and robb is all those things as well and if she turns out to be a doubleagent fuck thats hot wait what and before i forget i liked that when they were having sex they both laughed for once on this show sex is seen as a positive and fun event i mean its going to kill robb but hey still fun and when he unloaded on cat i was right there with him she fucked it up and she had to be told robb told her and fuck her freeing the ks was weak the siege of stormâ<U+0080><U+0099>s end and robert and renlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s brother stannis is possibly my second or third favorite character in the books handless and noseless take 1 and 2 usually and on the show he has stepped up gotten laid and nailed this part whenever he speaks you get this sense of not only his determination and raw almost pathological force of will but you can sense his emotional void how when he held robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s center he deserved not only praise but gratitude instead he got sent to dragonstone and all the while he talked about the horses and cats and dogs and the hate the hate the hate and also the unfairness one of the reasons i like stannis and one of the reasons i think the actor is hitting stannis so well is because i think we have all at one time or another known what its like to be truly treated unfairly stannis is the rightful king and his realm is the seven kingdoms period whatever robb or dead renly or tywin think matters not at all robert was king died without legal issue case closed and yet he aint the king and so that same sense of fairness that drives stannis also serves him to treat davos well it causes him to listen to wise counsel and it makes him toss aside those who are arrogant proud and wrong to me thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s why stannis works so  so the fury comes out woe be onto they who gets in that way mace tyrell renly the castellan of storms end gold cloaks mance ryder or some karstarks youve been warned fuck if i was mace tyrell id want anyone king other than stannis stannis has to be the only guy in the 7 kingdoms who kicks the shit out of you and then says want a rematch and he never blinks the actor who plays him i think has blinked like 8 times this season the jaime and brienne show now that tywin and arya has been cancelled i hope the jaime and brienne show is able to hold that time spot so far so good jaime is arrogant and infuriating brienne proud and unbending they make an amazing duo the salvation of jon snow okay so it only took them three episodes but i think the show has been able to cobble together the important bits and save jon snowâ<U+0080><U+0099>s storyline they are going to do the halfhand fight etc and it may potentially save time in the long run if thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the case than this worked out if not wellâ<U+0080> â<U+0080><U+009C>you know nothing jon snowâ<U+0080><U+009D> is going to be the worst drinking game ever the spider and the imp i got nothing â<U+0080>cept that donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need to say anything else bran a boy knowsâ<U+0080> what i am on the fence about the least shocking reveal ever who didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think it was going to be roz okay i know we read it in the books and all but â<U+0080> if you made 50 people watch this show episode 1 to episode 18 and then right before she walks out ask them â<U+0080><U+009C>who is going to walk out in that roomâ<U+0080><U+009D> how many of the 50 say â<U+0080><U+009C>rozâ<U+0080><U+009D> and how many of them roll their eyes when they say it iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m going to say 32 say â<U+0080><U+009C>rozâ<U+0080><U+009D> 20 of them roll their eyes and two guys add the word â<U+0080><U+009C>fuckingâ<U+0080><U+0099> to her name now for me i was fine with it it just felt utterly unnatural the whole time and when roz walked out all i could think of was â<U+0080><U+009C>thank christ i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have to listen to shae and then the next scene had shae in it so i ran cold water in my bath tub in preparation of opening a vein but hey she was fine dany it was a pointless scene we could have had no dany this week and tacked on that scene to the week when she burns down the house of the undying and it would have been fine but what was there was fine we get it heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a moron whenever theon talks to â<U+0080> anyoneâ<U+0080> i just want him to stop and its not because heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s poorly written or poorly acted but because theon greyjoy is a car wreck and with that said its pretty much identical to him in the books so not complaining about that just â<U+0080> why does theon have to be so â<U+0080> human what i did not like fuck it was a great episode no bad things to say really just next weekâ<U+0080> i put odds of stannis dying

king in the north west look for reasons not entirely clear to me some viewers do not like robbâ<U+0080><U+0099>s relationship with the volantian woman but watching robb comfortably talk to another

books handless and noseless take 1 and 2 usually and on the show he has stepped up gotten laid and nailed this part whenever he speaks you get this sense of not only his determination and raw almost pathological force of will but you can sense his emotional void how when he held robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s center he deserved not only praise but gratitude instead he got sent to dragonstone and all the while he talked about the horses and cats and dogs and the hate the hate the hate and also the unfairness one of the reasons i like stannis and one of the reasons i think the actor is hitting stannis so well is because i think we have all at one time or another known what its like to be truly treated unfairly stannis is the rightful king and his realm is the seven kingdoms period whatever robb or dead renly or tywin think matters not at all robert was king died without legal issue case closed and yet he aint the king and so that same sense of fairness that drives stannis also serves him to treat davos well it causes him to listen to wise counsel and it makes him toss aside those who are arrogant proud and wrong to me thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s why stannis works so  so the fury comes out woe be onto they who gets in that way mace tyrell renly the castellan of storms end gold cloaks mance ryder or some karstarks youve been warned fuck if i was mace tyrell id want anyone king other than stannis stannis has to be the only guy in the 7 kingdoms who kicks the shit out of you and then says want a rematch and he never blinks the actor who plays him i think has blinked like 8 times this season the jaime and brienne show now that tywin and arya has been cancelled i hope the jaime and brienne show is able to hold that time spot so far so good jaime is arrogant and infuriating brienne proud and unbending they make an amazing duo the salvation of jon snow okay so it only took them three episodes but i think the show has been able to cobble together the important bits and save jon snowâ<U+0080><U+0099>s storyline they are going to do the halfhand fight etc and it may potentially save time in the long run if thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the case than this worked out if not wellâ<U+0080> â<U+0080><U+009C>you know nothing jon snowâ<U+0080><U+009D> is going to be the worst drinking game ever the spider and the imp i got nothing â<U+0080>cept that donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need to say anything else bran a boy knowsâ<U+0080> what i am on the fence about the least shocking reveal ever who didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think it was going to be roz okay i know we read it in the books and all but â<U+0080> if you made 50 people watch this show episode 1 to episode 18 and then right before she walks out ask them â<U+0080><U+009C>who is going to walk out in that roomâ<U+0080><U+009D> how many of the 50 say â<U+0080><U+009C>rozâ<U+0080><U+009D> and how many of them roll their eyes when they say it iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m going to say 32 say â<U+0080><U+009C>rozâ<U+0080><U+009D> 20 of them roll their eyes and two guys add the word â<U+0080><U+009C>fuckingâ<U+0080><U+0099> to her name now for me i was fine with it it just felt utterly unnatural the whole time and when roz walked out all i could think of was â<U+0080><U+009C>thank christ i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have to listen to shae and then the next scene had shae in it so i ran cold water in my bath tub in preparation of opening a vein but hey she was fine dany it was a pointless scene we could have had no dany this week and tacked on that scene to the week when she burns down the house of the undying and it would have been fine but what was there was fine we get it heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a moron whenever theon talks to â<U+0080> anyoneâ<U+0080> i just want him to stop and its not because heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s poorly written or poorly acted but because theon greyjoy is a car wreck and with that said its pretty much identical to him in the books so not complaining about that just â<U+0080> why does theon have to be so â<U+0080> human what i did not like fuck it was a great episode no bad things to say really just next weekâ<U+0080> i put odds of stannis dying at 25 and climbing fuckâ<U+0080> just like book 5â<U+0080> stannis is cominglove this post so much and im over my quota dammitâ<U+009D>â<U+009D>â<U+009D>â<U+009D>â<U+009D>â"

"jlk7e",2012-05-21,"this was the first episode where the changes started to get to me given the fact that they hadnt set up any of the stuff relating to weasel soup and that roose is off with robb in the westerlands i suppose i shouldnt have been surprised that they didnt have it but it was still a bit jarring my bigger complaints are two 1 what on earth is the deal with talisa i was convinced last week by her reluctance to go to the crag that she was jeyne but now shes telling a detailed and convincingly detailed story about her life in volantis and seems to have returned from the crag without incident so she is talisa if so why did they even bring the crag into it why do the extras say that the crag is home to house westerling thats just purposefully fucking with book readers i think which is annoying 2 more subtly i was a little bit irritated by the way tywin took his leave of arya which i guess is a complaint that the show runners havent changed from the books as much as they should have i guess i kind of thought that tywins interactions with her would prove to have some importance in the plot  that maybe he knew she was arya or something because we saw a ton of them sitting in that room talking to each other and then hes just alright im heading out take good care of the mountain for me it didnt feel very satisfying within the context of the show but perhaps that was inevitable other than that i was fairly satisfied i dont mind the change in catelyns release of jaime although i wish shed have said that she did it in part because she was afraid karstark and his men would murder jaime if she didnt and end all chance of her seeing her daughters and some of the other changes turn out not to have been changes at all as i expected  jon and qhorins endgame will play out basically as it did in the books bran and company are still hiding in the crypts and lots of good scenes  i loved stannis and davos theon and yara cersei and tyrion all the tyrionbronnvarys business and brienne and jaime still not sure what i think of robbtalisa i guess i have to start calling her that now as im too confused about whats going on but oona chaplin certainly has a great body and the book version obviously wouldnt work given that madden isnt 15 the dany plot i still dont really care about but ill be interested to see the house of the undying i suppose ill also have to admit that i was stupidly wrong in thinking they wouldnt use ros in alayayas role i thought it wouldnt make any sense why cersei would think she meant something to tyrion but i guess it was fine and it was obviously pretty predictable since everyone else predicted it ah well"

"pleonasm",2012-05-21,"i feel almost redeemed with this train wreck of an episode every major issue ive had with this seasons writing was pretty much proven correct 1 the miscast and terrible writing of shae who bought for a second that tyrion had fallen head over heels for her there hasnt been a single scene this season that would suggest that his feelings are anything more than sexual and now he is near tears uggh 2 talisa  stupid unnecessary rewrite of a minor character which required a long lenghty and boring backstory this week that adds really nothing to the robbjeyne westerling union i wasnt against modifying the original story given the aging up of robbs character but this was as awful as expected it isnt the actors both are more than competent to deliver the goods but i wasnt feeling anything with these two even the clumsy attempt of humour during the stripping down scene as least i think was an attempt came off as terrible 3 arya and tywin  yes  they have chemistry in spades but other than cersei and tyrion what two characters had more screen time together this season and what was the point in the end nothing yes  we got some lessons in great acting from charles dance and maise but to have no real significant point for the characters suggests what a poorly thought out idea why not at least play up the drama and have tywin get a letter from tyrion indicating they have lost arya and tywin suddenly clueing in on who this high born girl is at least it would add some drama to the events at harrenhal or as i like to call it aryas haunted castle vacation 4 qarth despite all the rewrites and changes it remains the weak storyline that it was in clash of kings it feels like its taking her a month to get from the kidnapping of the dragons to actually visiting the house of the undying that said i did like stannis and davros and tyrion with everyone excluding shae edited by pleonasm 21 may 2012  0203 am"

"Versiroth",2012-05-21,"i feel almost redeemed with this train wreck of an episode every major issue ive had with this seasons writing was pretty much proven correct 1 the miscast and terrible writing of shae who bought for a second that tyrion had fallen head over heels for her there hasnt been a single scene this season that would suggest that his feelings are anything more than sexual and now he is near tears uggh 2 talisa  stupid unnecessary rewrite of a minor character which required a long lenghty and boring backstory this week that adds really nothing to the robbjeyne westerling union i wasnt against modifying the original story given the aging up of robbs character but this was as awful as expected it isnt the actors both are more than competent to deliver the goods but i wasnt feeling anything with these two even the clumsy attempt of humour during the stripping down scene as least i think was an attempt came off as terrible 3 arya and tywin  yes  they have chemistry in spades but other than cersei and tyrion what two characters had more screen time together this season and what was the point in the end nothing yes  we got some lessons in great acting from charles dance and maise but to have no real significant point for the characters suggests what a poorly thought out idea why not at least play up the drama and have tywin get a letter from tyrion indicating they have lost arya and tywin suddenly clueing in on who this high born girl is at least it would add some drama to the events at harrenhal or as i like to call it aryas haunted castle vacation 4 qarth despite all the rewrites and changes it remains the weak storyline that it was in clash of kings it feels like its taking her a month to get from the kidnapping of the dragons to actually visiting the house of the undying that said i did like stannis and davros and tyrion with everyone excluding shae1 this was the reveal that tyrion was head over heels even shae seemed surprised not everything in a tv show can have an elaborate build up a lot of people simply expect too much its obvious that tyrion was trying to hideprotect shae and in this episode we find out that hes in love with her 2 so youd have rather robb go off to the crag and then come back married to some random girl they couldnt have the duaghter of the enemy roaming around in robbs camp even if it would have been that jeyne was there to spy as people guessed robb would have been forced to execute her once he found out for providing intel to his enemies this way you get to see more with robb you get to see why he broke his oath and you get to see their love story this will make future events hit even harder the fact that robb marries jeyne has no consequence in the showbooks at all talisa gives the audiance something to see in the show from robb the book barely had him in it at all3 arya and tywin gave screen time and insight to two important characters regardless of people thinking arya some how too innocent in the show due to not killing a guard herself she ordered the death of two men and was also responsible for the death of those guards that alone shows shes capable to taking life it shows the path shed going down im guessing they will use the killing part as a character arc once she gets to braavos theyll likely make her struggle with it its a time limited tv show would you honestly have rather them give screen time to a bunch of random characters like in the book and on top of that a lot of what you get in the book is inner monologue another writing device that doesnt work on screen4 i dont disagree that danys story is the weakest this season but i appreciate that they tried martin really didnt do much with her in this book other than in the hotu so the writers on the show gave it more build up all they did was try to spice up what they were given luckily her story gets better going forward taken for what it is this is an awesome show the best on tv right now imo its honestly sad that people that have read the books well a lot cant just watch it for what it is this is not the book series its an adaptation minor things will change a lot and very important things will change some too from time to time it happens stop watching it with a magnifying glass and a copy of the book in hand and youll enjoy it much much more otherwise you might as well stop watching altogether and just reread the books i promise nothing will have changed in those at all"
"David Selig",2012-05-21,"so stannis will attack in tow days and tywins army is still at harrenhall and he wants to attack robbs forces how would stannis be defeated at blackwater i really hope they wont have tyrion defeats him only with the meagre forces he has in kl this would be ridiculous though given that they are doing their best to whitewahs tyrion and turn him into a hero with no flaws it wouldnt surprise me no word on lfs negotiation with the tyrells which sucks i was hoping wed see how he arranged the alliance they showed him in so many pointless scenes this season yet apparently skipped the really important ones anyway pretty good episode overall bu i am disappointed they didnt show how more of the interaction between cat and jaime  the vows how jaime was released and got out of the camp etc the scene between robb and cat shouldve been longer too so much potential for drama there was largely wasted i really dont like arya didnt have to kill anyone to get out of harrenhal this is a crucial part of her character deveopment showing how ruthless and desensitized she has become because of all the violence shes witnessed at such an young age and also showing how capable she is to deal with problems stannis hates cats and likes dogs figures no wonder hes such a killjoy"
"StannisandDaeny",2012-05-21,"he doesnt like cats that much hate is such a strong word that gets tossed around too easily i share your worry about tywin leaving harrenhal too late i just cant see how hes still going to make it to kings landing the most likely outcome is that the tyrells will save the day on their own not something im looking forward to as much as i applaud them going through such lengths in order to not have to skip this battle i fear itll become the typical tv kindof battle where the larger force gets beaten through tactics and heroism rather than a stupid trick and overwhelming reinforcements"

"Orys'Fury",2012-05-21,"up until tonight i really didnt pay attention to anyone theorizing that dagmer was ramsay at all but it just seems like theyre really endeavoring to prop the character of dagmer up hes almost in every scene with theon granted its to give theon someone to talk to but that aside maybe roose had known theon couldnt be trusted and as a backup plan he decided to plant ramsay on pyke for theons homecomingnot a fan of dagmer  ramsay but what if ramsay sent reek dagmer to follow robb and theon south knowing the north would be ripe for the picking and then onto pyke to convince theon now all reekdagmer has to do is open the gates for ramsay"
"David Selig",2012-05-21,"oh and i was quite annoyed that robb kept saying that the deal with the freys was only for a bridge and ignored the 4000 soldiers he got out of it every single one of which he desperately needs now after they made a point at the start of the episode to show how robb considers himself to be a really responsible lord caring for his subjects ignoring this is quite hypocritical not marrying the frey girl would not be just robb breaking his word it would mean losing a large part of his army at a time he really could not afford it and robb knows that robb and talisa had the potential to be a good plotline both of the actors are very good they have decent chemistry together and oona chaplin being gorgeous helps matters a lot but the writing is just so bad their scenes remain mediocre at the best of times was anyone surprised even a little bit by the story of why talisa became a medic its basically the same story weve all seen and read dozens of times every dialogue between those two is so predictable and follows the cliches so closely i can guess the next line basically word for word without even trying much some positives  the theonasha scene at the start was really good lena headeys acting has improved by leaps and bounds since last season her cersei looks a lot more convincing to me now good to see varys again edited by david selig 21 may 2012  1147 am"

"AegonTheUnlikely",2012-05-21,"seems like opinions regarding the show have diverged here a bit in the last several weeks allow me to throw in my own two cents 1 robbtalisajeyne i was sure she wold turn out to be jeyne westerling when she was hesitant to go to the crag im less certain about that now but either way i disagree with all those who call this romance useless jeyne westerling was never more than a plot device to get robb to break his pact with walder frey and eventually set up the red wedding whether she is jeyne westerling or some random volantene girl the effect of her and robbs whirlwind romancemarriage is the same frey is pissed and bolton sees a chance to move up in the world their romance isnt the most interesting thing on the show but i dont disagree with the showrunners on this one robb cant disappear for an entire season from a storytelling point of view too long of a hiatus for fans to keep up interest and from a production point of view if madden walks and gets another job you might not get him back 2 arya at herrenhal ive liked these bits all season i once again agree mostly with the decisions the producers have made having harrenhal change hands as often as it did in the books would confuse fans it confused me a bit my first read through also without the bloody mummers its kind of impossible to work in the whole weasel soupdoublecross lorch was bound for the grave anyways and gregor clegane isnt very well going to betray the lannisters the thing about the weasel soup episode if im not mistaken was that aryas plan was just kind of icing on the cake hoat was already going to give harrenhal to bolton of course speculation abounds as to whether this was all part of tywins plans to set the red wedding in motion it might very well have been his first move in that gambit iirc not long after bolton takes the castle arya overhears the frey prisoners arguing over whether or not to get on board the tywin train with so many characters out it would have been impossible to really recreate the books plot there but think about it jacquen killing multiple guards serves as a weasel soup of sorts aryas last name resulting in multiple deaths of unsuspecting guards and just because she didnt kill anyone on the way out doesnt mean that she cant slit some poor sobs throat in episode 9 or 10 and whisper valar morghulis as he slips to the ground i think maise williams is a fantastic arya and im ok with how her story is moving along theon i think theons story in the north is being executed perfectly others have said and i agree that this was the first time i ever really liked yara in a scene she hasnt lived up to the asha in my mind but that character only started to become more interesting to me after acok anyways i actually very much enjoyed her chapters in adwd call me crazy but i rather enjoy the whole iron born subplot im interested in how leuwin knowing for certain that bran and rickon are alive changes things but it i think its relatively minor indeed it might turn his unfortunate death into a more noble sacrifice for the little lords i think speculation that at least one if not both reeds will show up next season is probably correct the meeting can be done in a number of believable ways and keeps the story moving on the right track splitting up bran and rickon destinations etc the fact that rickon gets so little screen time now is a good thing in that if he become important several seasons down the line they can pretty much recast that character as soon as he and bran are split unless they plan on showing some of those formerly offscreen adventures otoh the actress playing osha is said to be a favorite of the showrunners so they may be juggling who escorts who where which might result in leuwin being left alive to take rickon tyrion ive liked his bits this season too its obvious theyve streamlined quite a bit i was mildly disappointed that we dont get as much a sense of tyrions personal force of crazy mountain tribespeople also not nearly enough pod who like rickon perhaps is being kept anonymous because of a need for future recasting but i think the cuts have been mostly good and they work im surprised they cut the chain as that seems the easiest bit of the blackwater to leave in but tyrions masterful defense of kings landing was the result of more than just one idea he made several key decisions as long as enough of them are in the mix its his victory jon snow another bit where ive agreed with the changes i would have preferred the fist be in the woods not on a mountain top but thats nitpicking imo i think the stuff at crasters and the changes made with jonygritteqhorin appear to be getting us to the same place qhorin has set jon up to kill him and go undercover with the free folk it even creates a nice parallel with jons earlier inability to do what needed to be done danny hers is the story ive been most underwhelmed by but i dont think its the showrunners fault danny does nothing in qarth in the books besides asking for aid from every faction in town and being turned down by each the hotu serves as the catalyst to get her on the move i fully understand why the changes that were made were necessary how much additional time would it have taken to set up and explain the pureborn each of the 3 merchant guilds xaros place as a leader in one of those guilds the guilds continuous conflict among themselves and with the pureborn and the warlocks and their part in the ongoing petrification of qarth too much its all too complicated for what amounts to the b or even c plot of the book so the fact that dannys story has been unfamiliar and not up to the same quality as the rest of the plots is not surprising im not worried though she still is going to go to the hotu will still likely burn it down only shell mean it this time and will still likely have to leave the city quite quickly afterwards enter arstan whitebeard talk about a ship sent by illyrio and scene she still goes to astapor next season and does her thing in slavers bay it will be interesting to see if mereen where danny does do quite a bit will translate better than qarth wheh that was long any thoughts edit oh i forgot sansa her story has tracked the book pretty closely i will say im somewhat surpriseddisappointed that ser dontos has been basically ignored since she saved him from his ironic death hers is another story that i think will pick up steam once she marries tyrion and the tyrells show up i suppose that maybe theyve delayed the note and plans to escape might be due to a desire to make it clear that the entire operation is littlefingers as far as sansas story is concerned as long as they get one of my favorite lines in ill be happy  lf telling sansa to get the

"Versiroth",2012-05-21,"how many folks had this complaint last season not as many as this season i gather   they have changed the nature i dont care about talisa or jeyne i dont care about ygritte have better teeth than i have in the 21st century i dont care about shae i dont care about bronn being head of the gold cloaks or melisandre being skinny and not curvylicious the reality is that when you have something so essential as the development of a relationship between jon and the halfhand and something as essential as the black rage and utter despair of robb and cat after she hears that bran and rickon are slaughtered you start to lose the nature of the story the nature of the drama halfhands death will seem pointless as jon is already questioning his vows to the watch thanks to some booty shaking by ygritte who looks flawless for a wilding woman and it seems like cat was just a selfish weasel not a mother who had nothing left a dead husband 2 dead children and was all in for her girls   it harms the nature of the story i will admit and will take chastening for my whining earlier this month you are correct i need to read acok and shut up but not this time this was wrong this was garbage this had me furious because it makes the starks look like selfish jerks right now the lannisters look more noble and trustworthy than the starks   robb and catelyn drama robb locking up his own mom  drama robb releasing her when he finds out that his brothers are dead  drama robb instantly forgiving catelyn never made sense in the books anyway this way he did the right thing by imprisoning her and the news of the deaths will give him reason to release her and it was made obviously clear that karstark was planning on killing jaime so her releasing him in an attempt to free her daughters was obvious learning of her sons deaths doesnt change that she saw this as her lone opportunity to free her daughters not once has jon shown to be questioning his vows he couldnt kill ygritte in the books and he couldnt in the show heck in the books he actually lets her go which shows him staying more tru to his vows that in the book even the halfhands death will be the same he will order jon to kill him and then play the role of spy theyre already setting that up the only difference is that jon got more time with ygritte a character that will play a big part next season over quorin who dies soon anywaysome times written word just doesnt translate you cant read a book and then expect inner monologue pointless travel scenes scenes about how much food the characters have left etc will make the cut into a time limited series they simply do not have the time"

"HyacinthGirl",2012-05-21,"1 this was the reveal that tyrion was head over heels even shae seemed surprised not everything in a tv show can have an elaborate build up a lot of people simply expect too much its obvious that tyrion was trying to hideprotect shae and in this episode we find out that hes in love with her 2 so youd have rather robb go off to the crag and then come back married to some random girl they couldnt have the duaghter of the enemy roaming around in robbs camp even if it would have been that jeyne was there to spy as people guessed robb would have been forced to execute her once he found out for providing intel to his enemies this way you get to see more with robb you get to see why he broke his oath and you get to see their love story this will make future events hit even harder the fact that robb marries jeyne has no consequence in the showbooks at all talisa gives the audiance something to see in the show from robb the book barely had him in it at all 3 arya and tywin gave screen time and insight to two important characters regardless of people thinking arya some how too innocent in the show due to not killing a guard herself she ordered the death of two men and was also responsible for the death of those guards that alone shows shes capable to taking life it shows the path shed going down im guessing they will use the killing part as a character arc once she gets to braavos theyll likely make her struggle with it its a time limited tv show would you honestly have rather them give screen time to a bunch of random characters like in the book and on top of that a lot of what you get in the book is inner monologue another writing device that doesnt work on screen 4 i dont disagree that danys story is the weakest this season but i appreciate that they tried martin really didnt do much with her in this book other than in the hotu so the writers on the show gave it more build up all they did was try to spice up what they were given luckily her story gets better going forward taken for what it is this is an awesome show the best on tv right now imo its honestly sad that people that have read the books well a lot cant just watch it for what it is this is not the book series its an adaptation minor things will change a lot and very important things will change some too from time to time it happens stop watching it with a magnifying glass and a copy of the book in hand and youll enjoy it much much more otherwise you might as well stop watching altogether and just reread the books i promise nothing will have changed in those at all agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree  pretty much identical to my thoughts i wish people would stop playing spot the difference and enjoy the show because its fantastic television the phrase bad writing or lazy writing is thrown about so much on these threads but 99 unjustified to say that because some people cant handle minor changes and go apeshit at the evil writers for butchering the show just because theyre translating it into another medium rolleyesgif classbbcemoticon altrolleyes "

"Versiroth",2012-05-21,"i think you are missing the criticism it isnt that change is bad its the quality of the changes thats the problem this is a we will have to be an agree to disagree arguement this is hardly the best tv show on right now yes  it might be the most ambitious but the quality of writing and plotting is mixed at best and we all realize its an adaption which will necessitate changes in fact when they do it well i think they deserve tonnes of credit ie theons execution of roderick when its done poorly or not thought through they can be called out tywin and arya is annoying because there is no payoff its a great concept with a some great moments but its pointless because of the lack of payoff shae fails because the writing never established the importance of the relationship to tyrion before the scene with cersei or a single scene that redeems shae as a character they attempted last week with her coming to the defence of sansa but that felt trite to me talisa and robb is boring thats the problem it not that they changed anything but the change itself is boring replace talisa with jeyne westerling and retain the same scenes and dialouge and it still would suck i know good dramatic and comedic writing when i see it and this season has unfortunately lots of bad writing and plottingyeah we will agree to disagree then because i disagree with you completely"

"Rickon is FIERCE",2012-05-21,"im thinking that talisa is going to turn out to be the daughter of gerion lannister tywins youngest brother who was last seen in volantis before he sailed off into smoking sea looking for brightroar amid the ruins of valyria as to whether or not shell turn out to be working or spying for twywin no ideaintriguingi always felt the ironborn were morons here yeah your strength lies in the sea you still went to war against the north and you arent going to conquer it or be ready when robb goes north by harrying a few villages and staying at sea either dont go to war or do it properly theons chances werent fantastic but at least he committed to the hopeless war they started balon and asha had learned absolutely nothing from theons brothers deaths and wouldve steered towards the same old end if not for euron but here yara when they were alone went for different angle a ironbron dies at sea she wants her brother to be an ironborn win or lose theon doesnt get this he doesnt see how being prince of winterfell and ironborn are two different things which is what his character arc is all aboutbrillianti like jorahs being all off course i remember you stepping out of flames unburnt you were supernaked i think about that moment every second of every day lmaogif classbbcemoticon altlmao not a bad episode i could have cheerfully done without seeing more robbtalisa scenes but at least roz didnt talk too much while standing in for alayaya from the books cersei was in better form in this episode  perhaps she just had to have somebody whipped to restore the confidence that was lagging in the last episode its not easy being queen finally a moment or two when i liked ashayara it started when she had her feet up on the winterfell table a pose that seemed very ashaish nice scene between her and theon poor theon is still trying to be both stark  wanting to compensate the miller for murdering his fostersons  and ironborn by claiming credit for killing bran and rickon alfie allen is extremely believable as theon tyrion is very much in love with shae and it seems fairly obvious to the viewer that she thinks hes cute or gullible but she certainly is nowhere near reciprocating his deep feelings for hergood points alltotally with you on cerseiamusingly putre shae i always read her as a total golddiggerironically the very thing tyrion thought tysha wasthought it was great writing for grrm to juxtapose those two in that way and mess with tyrions head and heartthe jamiebrienne road trip sets off in fine style more of these two less of talisa and robb and id be a happy watcher the danyjorah scene had a lovely view of the mighty cheekbones and azure eyes of iain glen but not much elsehere hereim sorry but thats one of the main problems i have with this episode because honestly it makes tywin look like a fool all those past episodes i though he knew who she was and just kept her around that way for his own specific reasons that were supposed to revealed later and i was thrilled to see where this was going yet now tywin realizes shes a highborn northern girl yet make no move whatsoever to find out who she is how many northern girls are running around in a war i ask you how come she was able to be captured when the lannisters havent even breached northern territory how come that nobody told tywin that amory lorch chased arya five minutes before he got murdered the show also lets tywin assume he was the target of the murder where the way the killing happened clearly suggests he isnt lorch drops dead into his room with the dart already in his neck tywin just appears to be big idiot instead of smart strategist way to ruin a role imo agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree osha being seen in broad daylight and luwin talking to her yet more watering down of the great writing in the books to provide tvesque plottery for the general public i should have put money on ros being the whore that fulfils all plot points that require a whoreyeah that osha thing was a wtf moment for me tooknew that ros thing was cominglove the way you put it thoughi think you are missing the criticism it isnt that change is bad its the quality of the changes thats the problem this is a we will have to be an agree to disagree arguement and we all realize its an adaption which will necessitate changes in fact when they do it well i think they deserve tonnes of credit ie theons execution of roderick when its done poorly or not thought through they can be called out tywin and arya is annoying because there is no payoff its a great concept with a some great moments but its pointless because of the lack of payoff shae fails because the writing never established the importance of the relationship to tyrion before the scene with cersei or a single scene that redeems shae as a character they attempted last week with her coming to the defence of sansa but that felt trite to me talisa and robb is boring i know good dramatic and comedic writing when i see it and this season has unfortunately lots of bad writing and plotting cheersgif classbbcemoticon altcheers "

"niA±ostark",2012-05-21,"slow boring episode biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd  blackwater seems great i loved the scene when tyrion is commanding people to kill those brave men tv robb does not have honor and blows everything for being horny that just sucks be it an adaptation and all it sucks hard the scene was horrible to watch even though the girl has a nice ass book arya is a badass starting to be a killing machine tv arya is not jaime theon and tyrion are the only ones im enjoying to watch i dont know if im the only one but beside the looks amazing casting btw the girl playing brienne sucks at acting"

"StannisandDaeny",2012-05-21,"at that point he wasnt fighting but you can be damned sure stannis committed the reserve to attack when his forces were being overrun it would be a poor general who would lose sight of the greater scale of the battle to go charging off from the start i remember the passage rmanoj is referring to as well he probably got caught up in the fighting during the retreat otherwise how would he know lightbringer didnt serve him better than any other sword they really should have given him lightbringer it would work awesomely in the darknessok ill say that i dont buy peoples interpretation of the bookrobbs actionsah so thats what you were saying i see i thought you meant what he did in the book was unrealistic which i thought was a result of you imagining him as grownrobb from the show i always thought he dreaded getting a bastard because he saw what that had caused with catelyn and thus made some false pretense about honour up for marrying jeyne completely oblivious to the fact breaking vows with your bannermen is equally if not worse offending he thought he could get away with it but obviously didnt know walder frey well enough i didnt hate him but i did think of him as a fool even if it hadnt been for lord frey marrying such a small house would have been stupid marrying asha in exchange for the north and support to get her on the throne of pyke on the other hand now theres a killer move shame robb such a shame so a fool he is but a 15year old fool who had a lot far too many burdens to carry at that and still did admirably at least on the field of battle of course edited by stannisanddaeny 21 may 2012  0414 pm"
"Fengari",2012-05-21,"winterfell great scene between theon and his sister i had no problems with yara before but i really liked her todayi especially loved how she sent her men away before changing her tone from mocking theon to telling him she doesnt want him to die the anecdote was a nice touch to show she does care for her brother even though she does not think him fit to lead the ironbornnorth of the wall i just repeat what i said about last weeks episode the changes do not affect whyhow jon joins the wildlings so no problem the scenes with ygritte showed the viewers how strong jon feels about his vows while he could still say it as we cant hear him think it later he was all alone with her nobody to rat him out and he was clearly tempted but didnt give in to it now were done with that im ready for kit to get out of all these furs for her nowso we were all wrong it wasnt sam finding the dragonglass it was grenn i think at least it has been found i wonder what the first mens signs were aboutrobbs campdifferent trigger for releasing jaimie yes but not less understandable and actually more justified though i understood the grief driving cat to her decision she did make a terrible gamble in the books after all with only brienne as an escort i dont think cleos ever counted how good was the chance of jaimie actually reaching kings landing and even if he did how big was the chance that that would get her girls back we know how well it worked out in this scenario she takes the gamble as opposed to leaving jaimie in a situation where he would most likely be lynched soon which would certainly be disastrous for her girlsgreat acting in the scene between robb and cat by the wayi liked the scenes of robb and talisa this episode now they havved dropped their guard around each other they feel a lot less awkward and thats fitting yes its a loveydovey romance story but it needs to be to have his fall from the freys grace make sense at all personally i feel this relationship they have set up makes more sense than the one in the book robb risking his kingdom for a woman he has come to know and love is less foolish and more mature than him sleeping with a nice nobody in a moment of weakness and then deciding he has to do the honorable thing one can argue not marrying her and honouring his previous promises would have been just as honourable after all as far as he knows even his father has had a fling on the sidei also dont get why people want talisa anything other than she appears to be because it is a different character than in the book it would be kind of hard to explain a noblemans daughter espacially from an enemy house being around him long enough to get to know and love in these circumstances and having him wounded and being nursed back to health in a castle would take him out of his camp too long to fit with the rest of the timelines as they are presented in the seriesif the conspiracy theories about talisa do turn out to be right though ill happily accept that dd have managed to surprise me as grrm has done so many timeson the road or river soooo looking forward to more of thatharrenhalldid i understand it correctly that tywin is marching towards robb isnt he coming to the rescue of kings landing theni liked how they showed arya was too late in thinking of naming tywin and i loved the unname me no please that smug expression on her face and the shrug when jaqen says a girl lacks honourweasel soup as i have said before is something i can do without even though i loved it in the books without prisoners it wouldnt have made much sense i do hope the escape isnt finished yet though i feel arya killing people along her journey with lessening horror at what shes doing is important but we know theres more jaqen and a coin to come so the possibility is still there them walking between all these staged guardcorpses was pretty coollooking thoughby the way hbo when jaqen sheds his face could you please send it over here for my husband to borrow for a bit that would compensate nicely for the lack of a certain bathscenekings landing all tyrions scenes were great as always and bronn varys and cersei are great with him im a bit worried about him being so desperately late in planning the defenses though i really want the viewers to see that he really was who saved kings landing not renlys ghost or tywin if he ever gets there im reserving judgement until after next episode thoughi wonder if tyrion ever contemplates this opportunity if he gets joffrey killed cersei will kill roz and shae will be safe because cersei will think shes already gotten tyrions love winwinwin well the last one purely for tyrion the actress playing shae is not convincing meim looking forward to seeing joffreys arrogance crumble next week theres too many of them in the preview had me cracking upim not usually one who notices the cinematography aspects consciously unless they are bad but what a great image when varys and tyrion talk about the dragons with the flames on the foregroundon sea i now know why i have never like stannis he is not a cat persongood exposition between stannis and davos though i think for nonreaders it would have been good to get this a bit earlier in the seasonqarth when danys dragons were stolen i thought it was to give her something to do until going to the house of the undying but she doesnt really do much does he im starting to fear it is to give her something to do in the house of the undying instead of walking around having visions if i think about it more that makes sense they have left everything that is dreams visions or prophecy out except when it is for bran where it is quite obviously very necessary so why would they include those from the house showing the rw without giving too much away is difficult the vision of rhaegar has no immediate part in the storylines so far and we didnt get the other rlj clues either im lowering my expectations that way i can only be pleasantly surpriseda final note if im wrong and there will be visions i want to request an added one arya holding armfuls of small golden statues of naked bald men holding swords"

"Raksha the Demon",2012-05-21,"well he for sure isnt a dog person xd just watch every single dog that ever appears in the series  bad things happen to almost all of them in a way that is simply grotesque the dog violence is often grittier and more gory than the human violence which says a lot i thinkas a dog person who admires cats i have noticed that grrm does have a tendency to do very unpleasant things to dogs there are two other works by him that i dont reread because of it i dont think hes much kinder to cats in agot yes tommen loves kittens and balerion the kitten survived but the description of joffreys torture of the kitchen cat in retrospect is ghastly and two out of five stark direwolves  the biggest baddest canids of all  died violently though it can be argued that the fates of lady and grey wind are plotdirectedim not optimistic for the long lives of ramseys girls which is kinda sad because they dont seem to be particularly vicious dogs they just do what ramsey has trained them to do track and hunt theyre actually quite friendly to theonreek i would imagine that at least one or two of tommens kittens will survive though it wouldnt surprise me to learn that grrm is either indifferent to dogs or dislikes them but that may not be the case he just may be a total cat person he has cats right"

"MaximusDecimus",2012-05-22,"well i believe that no way that while dagmer has no chance of being ramsay that he will have an active part in the sack of winterfell probably opening the gates to ramsay or something like that it would be a nice scene for somewhere near the end of episode 10 it would still be along the lines of theon is responsible for his own downfall for trusting visibly evil people and would be a nice way to not show ramsay while still letting him be known by the audience letting him be cast only later probably in season 45 as for the reeds it sads my heart but that scene where the meister met with osha practically sealed their faiths as never appearing in the show for me they will probably replace them both by osha since she already replaced jojen in an earlier scene and have the meister leave with rickon never to be seen again probably the saddest part missing from the books since the reeds are among my and many others favorites including howland that has yet to appear but is already a great character"

"dark  sister",2012-05-22,"hm generally i liked this episode at one point i thought finally things are getting interesting and then i realized it was the 8th episode of the season when it takes 8 episodes to build up to tensionfilled events like that somethings a bit off looking back on the preceding episodes a lot of it comes through as characters dicking around annoying each other with dialogue that has no bearing on the show and adding scenes that dont build up to anything i found that in the first season it was the exact opposite  every episode was full of tension and that building up feeling i know that the books are different from each other yet there is plenty of action all the same perhaps more so than agot certainly a lot of shockers occur look i dont really care that they changed jeyne westerling to some random lady from volantis but when you look at the plot structure by doing this change it took many episodes to establish a rapport between her and robb areas of common interest mutual attraction etc however if they had just had him going to the crag capturing the castle and learning of his brothers with perhaps a scene about as long as the one in this episode it would have saved so much more time for other areas that needed to filled out  principally imho tyrions storyline as well as aryas after all in the books robb was pretty much instantly attracted to jeyne  why does it need to be deeper than that in fact it is the utter folly of his rash act that makes the following events even more tragic one thing that continually confuses me  why are they portraying cersei as the wise tactician and tyrion as the dummy who has no flare it seems like theyre presenting him as an overhorny courtier who is good at intrigue but not much good at anything else the chain is a really important part of the upcoming battle and yet we havent seen or heard anything about it if it suddenly starts rising from the water in episode 9 nonreading viewers will be confused and probably think it was either cerseis or tywins idea i thought the execution of the infamous dinner with cersei went off well but i did so want to see tyrion twisting cerseis arm and cowing her as well as her guards i personally believed that was such a crucial moment in the book when he reached for his fathers voice and found it he sounded cold uncaring instead cersei just sits there smiling and says get out and so he is routed why are they doing this role reversal it just makes no sense cersei has her sexuality and low cunning and tyrion has superior wits theyre making poor peter dinklage look a bit like a fool out of the things they changed nothing was too bad ive finally gotten over the fact that theyre not going to be as loyal to the second book as they were to the first in the beginning season so i try to just think of it as something entirely different for all i know they may not have the red wedding or the purple one my favorite scene was at the end when maester luwin spotted osha going into the crypts and as they talk about the farmers boys bran is awake and listening and osha says the little lads have been through enough already i felt that the line while simple was so eloquent about their situation  as well as the general situation and tragedy of the starks all of them have been through so damn much the music that began playing at that point was quite touching edited by dark sister 22 may 2012  0355 am"
"Ghost714",2012-05-22,"while i do think it has taken up a lot of screen time and while i do proffer the original storyline i actually liked the final scene with robb and talisa at the end of this episode i dont know if she is playing robb false or what but i thought her story about the slave saving her brother in volantis was actually quite touching and believable by the time she was done telling it i had also fallin in love with her and if that story was not true than she is a very convincing liar i dunno it was just refreshing to see this heartwarming fun love scene and i really felt happy for them when talisa started to joyously laugh and smile as they were kissing and undressing each other not to mention any execution is going to be good when you have oona chaplin getting naked at the end that was a definite bonus just wow that woman is gorgeous"
"Buckwheat",2012-05-22,"i honestly do not know what to think of it i liked jaime and brienne scene it will be fun seeing much more of it also the arya and jaqen scene was as good as all her scenes till now and i loved her look when she realised tywin is leaving and she was too late to wish for his death a lot disappointed by the lack of the weasel soup though i feel robbed of it i hated that they gave robb the lines that eddard is supposed to have told him about a man being brave when he is afraid ok they left the lines out from the discussion between brandon and eddard at the beginning it is shame but i can live with it but giving this to robb talking to this random volantene is just wrong as is the whole robbvolantene romance she is becoming his personal ros now also he was terrible to catelyn much more than is the books i do not care about asha and theon much they were good i suppose i loved the scene with luwin findding out that they were still alive still no house of the undying i thought they were going to show it at least 2 episodes ago and still not ros has a point in the plot now thank the old gods the thing with the necklace made sense it was interesting to see tyrion all concerned for shae it really showed that he loves her but since when can shae read"

"legba11",2012-05-22,"been ages since i read it but i remembered jon and the halfhand being cornered with no way out not ever exactly captured could be wrong thoughim not sure what the difference between being captured and being corned with no way out by an opposing force is but in the books quorin realizes they are going to get captured the wildlings had been pursuing them for days and they were quickly losing ground he sends the really cool red shirt ranger to take a snipers perch and try to hold them off while he and jon flee once the sniper is taken he realizes they will be caught so he picks a cave to make their last stand and enact his plan to save joni thought the execution of the infamous dinner with cersei went off well but i did so want to see tyrion twisting cerseis arm and cowing her as well as her guards i personally believed that was such a crucial moment in the book when he reached for his fathers voice and found it he sounded cold uncaring instead cersei just sits there smiling and says get out and so he is routed why are they doing this role reversal it just makes no sense cersei has her sexuality and low cunning and tyrion has superior wits theyre making poor peter dinklage look a bit like a fool im not sure how tyrion looks like a fool cersei is gloating over the trap she sprung on him and it turns out she had fallen for his decoy he plays it straight otherwise it would be revealed as not his whore and then delivers his killer minispeech about ashes in her mouth my nonbook fiance said something like go get her tyrion after that scene funny how people see the same thing different ways i dont mean that sarcastically i find it interestingi wanted to add to my negative review of this episode that one thing this season has done very well is display two of the things that really highlight how brilliant martins is writing in the novels he takes two generic fantasy situations and twists them with realworld problems theon takes a major city with an absurdly small force and a great plan this happens all the time in novels but rarely do you get to see the aftermath of what do you do now theon is as trapped in winterfell by his dual nature as bran and rickon are by their last names he was raised as a stark and trained in military planning ned could have done anything worse to set your kids up for failure at least you trained arya with a sword yet his troops are ironborn reavers not soldiers the show has done a great job of how this mix is not going to be successful so what can theon do now his men simply want to take the loot rape the women and burn it down his training says were at war we had the major control point of the region we must hold it at all cost including my own life to leave it would disgrace me this story has been a true highlight this season more interesting than the books even imothe second one is the classic big clash stannis is about to attack kl we dont like stannis he is not a good man even this week when he gives a very redeeming speech to davos he ends it being very unlikable he is fighting tyrion who we all love the best character on television right now they could not have done more to make tyrion more likable this week adding sadly misplaced love to his resume however next week who are we rooting for tyrion is fighting to keep joffery the shitheel of all shitheels on the throne i think this is why they have played up some stanniss lesser qualities this season plus it will make his faceturn more interesting next season"

"ThePrinceOfSunspear",2012-05-21,"i didnt have a problem with them showing his romance with jeyne onscreen rather than off but that isnt what theyve done now is it they made up a totally different story instead and it unfortunately it just plain sucks even when ignoring the books not only that but i would go so far as to say that it goes completely against robbs characterlets summarize here bookrobb is a boy of 15 full of raging hormones he took an injury at the crag he heard of his brotherss deaths and is grieving during all that he is comforted by a woman in a moment of understandable weakness after that happens he feels honourbound to marry her bookrobb is the son of ned stark and just like ned he takes oaths and hononour seriously he would have never deliberately broken his vow to the freys like that and when it does happen he feels stupid and terrible and tries his hardest to make amendstvrobb is a man grown i assume hes supposed to be 1820 he is not injured he has not learned of bran and rickons deaths and is not grieving hes not in any sort of particular trouble he even had his mother around to remind him of his duty and his oath to the freys yet hes palling around with some sexy wench and clearly states he doesnt want to marry the frey girl he deliberately breaks his vow and doesnt even have second thoughts about itwhat made robb sympathetic was because he was so much like ned and took his oath and his honour so seriously and he was young and naive and he actually married jeyne because of his nedlike honour as a stark there is none and absolutely none of that in his story with talissa not only is the story contrary to the spirit of the novel but even judged by its own merit as tv its bad its a clichad hollywood romance with little believability to it and it takes away a lot of the tragedy of the red wedding since robb pretty much has it coming personally the red wedding made me upset because of catelyns suffering losing her last son and death more than robbs death but by giving more attention to robb the tv series could have changed that well so much for that sadpng classbbcemoticon alt wordi cant add anything else except how shitty this show has becoming"

"Rapsie",2012-05-22,"other than making robb unlikable which i think they have done a sterling job of so far there is the butterfly effect of his decision in regards to his character robb didnt trade jaime for his sisters because he saw the kingslayer as a greater prize and knew his bannermen wouldnt be happy if he was released he knew that keeping his bannermen sweet was important that despite his personal feelings about his sisters he had to be shown to be doing what needed to be done also sadly with two living brothers sansa and arya were not as important he later regrets not trying to do more for them or at least trying to form an alliance with the tyrells by marrying sansa to the knight of flowers it is the deaths of bran and rickon that motivates cat to try and get her daughters back and robb to sleep with jeyne that is one of the reasons both cat and robb can sort of understand what the otherone has done its edmure that locks cat up not robb now we have petulant show robb who is now trying to fob off his responsibilities and getting all whiny about the personal cost of leadership being raised to be a high lord has many of the same expectations and duties as a prince being raised to be a king so instead of choosing the honour of a highborn maid which was an issue due to social norms he is clearly sleeping with this girl from essos who has no quams about jumping into bed with him who as a battleside nurse falls dangerously close to the camp follower category and presumably decides rather than keep his word he is just going to do what he wants and marry her consequences be damned the unfortunate side effect is that it makes him look childish and because the tullys havent been introduced he is no going to be forcing edmure to help him cover his mistake and that he cares nothing for his sisters his sisters werent worth losing bannermen but when it came to his own personal desires he was doing what he wanted"
"Giskard Reventlov",2012-05-22,"i somehow softened my stance to all this janeistalisa story though her background story is a bit dumb however talisa character as they portrayed her in the tv show  looks like someone who would stop robb from breaking his oath to freys and endangering himself and his cause alsoshe is a foreigner from volantis and it would be less shameful for robb although he is noble ad has his fathers example not to marry her on the other hand jane westerling from the books is a daughter from a poor but very noble house of westeros and it would be greater shame and more difficult for robb just to to leave her after open sexual relationship"

"AdiTarg",2012-05-22,"i find the main problem with the story is robb as a character like in the books he is a very one dimensional character he just do he doesnt have an agenda he doesnt develop besides becoming king in the north again something that fell upon him not something he aspired to do the tv show doesnt do a great job wit the character either he doesnt know what to do after he has one and thats a man who is king and people die for him how stupid is that he just fights for justice and thats it so the story of him is just left uninteresting because the character itself is just that uninteresting"

"sagaz",2012-05-22,"i didnt have a problem with them showing his romance with jeyne onscreen rather than off but that isnt what theyve done now is it they made up a totally different story instead and it unfortunately it just plain sucks even when ignoring the books not only that but i would go so far as to say that it goes completely against robbs character lets summarize here bookrobb is a boy of 15 full of raging hormones he took an injury at the crag he heard of his brotherss deaths and is grieving during all that he is comforted by a woman in a moment of understandable weakness after that happens he feels honourbound to marry her bookrobb is the son of ned stark and just like ned he takes oaths and hononour seriouslywell i think is more interesting in the show that he actually love the girl this is a change i favorhe would have never deliberately broken his vow to the freys like that and when it does happen he feels stupid and terrible and tries his hardest to make amendsno its better i think it picture him being a child in a more powerful way i didnt find anything remarkable in being sad and have sex with the next girl around and feeling honour boundtvrobb is a man grown i assume hes supposed to be 1820 he is not injured he has not learned of bran and rickons deaths and is not grieving hes not in any sort of particular trouble he even had his mother around to remind him of his duty and his oath to the freys yet hes palling around with some sexy wench and clearly states he doesnt want to marry the frey girlits understandable and he explains it very clearly when catelyn made that promise he was time pressed thinking from now it doesnt matter and the scene where robbtalissa were discussing this its very good depicting her interest and how upset she was when they were interrupted like two people in the limb only seeing and hearing each other very good acting by oona chaplinhe deliberately breaks his vow and doesnt even have second thoughts about it what made robb sympathetic was because he was so much like ned and took his oath and his honour so seriously and he was young and naive and he actually married jeyne because of his nedlike honour as a starkeeerrno because hes in love and the only thing separating him from this girl is the promise to the freys this make his flaw more sympathetic to me a guy in love vs a young man with a moment of weakness i dont need the guiltthere is none and absolutely none of that in his story with talissa not only is the story contrary to the spirit of the novel but even judged by its own merit as tv its bad its a clichad hollywood romance with little believability to it and it takes away a lot of the tragedy of the red wedding since robb pretty much has it coming personally the red wedding made me upset because of catelyns suffering losing her last son and death more than robbs death but by giving more attention to robb the tv series could have changed that well so much for that sadpng classbbcemoticon alt i absolutely cannot agree with you i dont know what you think is a good romance really but this is something this tv show is constructing since the episode where she cuts the leg and he hold the head of the man injured it isnt out of nowhere and the acting of richard madden in this episode was superb two faces the one when she enters the room and start talkingthat almost smile of a man totally pleased and infatuated well he played romeo he must know and the other when hes realizing that he doesnt want to marry the frey girl and the way he blurted it it was good acting as you can get and i really enjoyed the scene bowdowngif classbbcemoticon altbowdown i think i became a fan of maddens acting and will be following his careercoming back to the books i think this change makes rw more tragic and changes the point of the mistake the mistake is not robb entangled with jeyne the mistake is the promise to the freys something that robb actually didnt doedit clarification edited by sagaz 22 may 2012  1032 am"
"Envie",2012-05-22,"im going to confess i did not read all 7 pages of this raging debate im late to the party but just wanted to support morrigans efforts in defending this post there are a lot of very passionate people in this community and everyone has their personal favorites in the books as well as the series many like to compare  contrast the two while others called book purists by some seem to get really hung up on little details that are either left out changed or added in ways the book never did that they disagree with or hatei dont see morrigans post as that at all im willing to say that the robb stark story for lack of more detail in clash of kings was left far too wide open for vast changes and liberties the producers took with that opportunity and ran with it whether you agree with the direction they took it or not i dont think anyone can argue with the point that its much different than most other plot lines in the series and has had a lot more changes heres the bottom line though i cant figure out at all why they felt the changes theyve made to the robb  jeyne story were necessary in this casesure there are budget and filming reasons to drop characters that may not be essential to propelling the plot at this time in the series such as the reeds or many of the side characters in aryas harrenhal adventures weese for example there are also some stated reasons for changing characters names as with asha  yara there are also valid reasons for adding characters such as ros who essentially takes the place of alayaya and ends up being quite a useful exposition tool throughout the first two seasonsbut with jeyne westerling i cannot for the life of me figure out why they not only have changed her name her family heritagebackstory but theyve totally changed her motivations as well as the plot for how she and robb stark came to marry and ultimately betray the frey agreement which was really really important and stressed again and again in the book as a huge turning point in the book and led to the red wedding after watching all the episodes thus far up to robbs love scene with talisa i am just scratching my head in confusion over how lame it seems to be playing out not just their awkward acting which is entirely contrived since of course these scenes were never in the book but the entire flow of the story seems disjointed and off kilter from whatever was implied and revealed in the books the facts as morrigan posted in the op are completely skewedi like the actor they chose for robb stark i felt they were going in a great direction with his character portrayal in season 1 something we couldnt identify with as easily from the books you end up liking the heroic young wolf of the north a lot more i cant figure out why they felt his honor needed destroyed by porking this volantis chick for lack of a better word who is clearly not much like jeyne westerling at all not in the physical way she was described nor in the way she acts  behaves around robb in the books she was supposedly quite shy almost painfully so which catelyn remarked about several times one of the best lines of the books was that she was not worth losing a kingdom over or something similar in regards to robbs decision to betray the frey agreement in choosing to marry jeyne for honor which he doesnt do in the series at alli agree with someone elses assessment a few pages back that one of the beauties of the book was that pretty much all the characters had some gray area that couldnt be attributed to good or bad and some areas that seemed like a good call but ended up being just selfish motivations that end up getting them into trouble the jeyne westerling story for robb was his huge gray area his one big mistake after doing so well in battle and for them to make it a somewhat less meaningful fling like they have in the series really does diminish the overall importance of this significant turning point in the war as we all know  this key critical moment caused his entire campaign to fall apart from here on out why diminish that significance with making jeyne westerling some unknown woman he decides to bump uglies with on the floor at least they gave stannis the dignity of porking melisandre on the battle plan table ugh i really dont understand some of these gratuitous sex scenes other than yes the simple need for a sex component in an hbo series these could have been done much differently and still been great sex and in line with the book which had plenty of great and even gratuitous sex in itso yes in ending my essay i agree with morrigannitpick all you like about whether or not robb married jeyne for honor and was like ned stark or just another selfish bastard like everyone else in the books all you like  thats subject to personal opinion on reading the books for yourself but you cannot argue they changed the jeyne westerling story so drastically it barely resembles anything at all from the book love or hate those changesthere they are how will this change the rest of robbs story i dont know yet but my opinion is that theyve already lessened it a great deal i look forward to watching it play out nonetheless overall i love the series i dont love the jeyne westerling story at all even though i think oona chaplin is a very sexy actress and a decent actor my opinion again is that she was miscast in the role of jeyne westerling and would have made a much better shae or someone else honestly"

"Mulled Wino",2012-05-22,"they definitely ruined his character and since hell die before he can redeem himself its over for him he looks like a jackass at least in the books he was injured away from camp and had an excusea beautiful nurse was taking care of him back at the camp with jeyne he was all business again he was foolish for breaking the pact but he was being a naive 15 year old boy who didnt see the ramifications of his actions tv robb is just a fool and kind of an asshole when you think of it he has a war going on around him and really all we see him focused on is jeyne in the books he was so tense about everything that he could barely even talk to jeyne and she went to catelyn for advice no wonder roose keeps giving them looks of disdain not to mention this chick just waltzes in his tentreally they butchered his character go roose and jaime lannister sends his regards and yeah i never thought this in the books not to mention these writers need to stay far far away from romance writing having cheesy romance at all goes exactly against asoiaf do you really think grrm would write the kind of garbage dialogue theyve exchanged this this omg this the writers are so focused on making every girl in the show a mysterious bratty badass and its tiring and unrealistic it also makes the whole story a lot less tragic imo not all girls are like cersei or aryadamn you hk i was trying to be optimistic about robb but then i read this postbastard"

"Howdyphillip",2012-05-23,"to the op i agree with the base premise of your post i also believe that the tale told about rob stark and his relationship with jeyne westerling is better in principle than the story being told on the series that story would have been very brief on the tv show i cant speak for the writers but i assume that they made the changes to the story in order to give the audience more time with these characters as they will play such an integral part of the story next season in the books we never have a pov from rob we hear about him from other characters there is no way to give a viewing audience the same kind of emotional reactions that we as book readers experienced when reading about the red wedding without getting to know the characters involved this story allows for that while the way it is written does not just due to time constraints he cant meet jeyne westerling until the crag in the story which would leave all of 2 episodes and around 4 minutes of screen time for the audience to get to know them as for the world not knowing about the deaths of bran and rikon i have to believe that the writers have done this for a reason that has yet to be told possibly so that the reeds can be sent to serve them next season if it is well known they are dead then they would not be able to hook up with them next year i cringe at changes at first as well but then i stop a moment and try and reason to myself what the writers are thinking when they make the changes this is one that i understand i would much rather have a deeper connection to rob when his curtain is drawn this show is not just for me as a book reader people who have never seen the show need to throw their remote through the tv just as i threw my book across the room i think that this is a change that will make that outcome more likely that said i dont find these scenes to be the best acted in the series richard maddons delivery seems a little dry and the dialogue is too predictable but it still conveys to the audience the emotional attachment to robb that we were privy to as book readers i take strong issue with the word ruined in the post title even with disappointment that things are not exactly like they are in the books i think words like this and horrible or terrible are just unfair for this tv series i have been a fan of fantasy literature my whole life and nothing has even come close to being a better representation of this genre on tv edited by howdyphillip 23 may 2012  0244 am"

"birdsong66",2012-05-23,"i have to believe there is a reason tptb have decided on this course of actionplotlinearc perhaps it is a simple as providing side by side examples of consequences and building it so that as a viewer your judgement bounces from one to the other as a means to lay blame robb leaves camp with talisapoor form viewers collectively wtf consequence discord threats of beheadings jamie is released by catelyn catelyn releases jaimepoor form viewers collectively wtf consequence loss of valuable hostage loss of trust between robbcatelyn imprisonment for catelyn northern forces weakened robb sleeps with talisapoor form viewers collectively wtf despite enjoying sex scene with naked girl ohhhhh boobies consequence robbs honor potentially compromised compromised in front of his troops future betrayals of bannermen pregnancy but the mother of all is robb sends theon to baylon ill advised specifically advised by both parents not to do this consequence loss of family seat two youngest siblings captured two youngest siblings presumedreported dead fewer heirs to winterfell yall getting the idea placing all of those back to back building it in some small way redeems catelyns actions whereas robbs become ill advised at best absolutely devastating worst so possibly there is still hope"
"mike_s_6",2012-05-23,"i didnt read the whole thread but i somehow agree with op for me though it was not at all about robbs character he was a fool even in the book but the way it was handled in the show softened the series of events that was topped with robbs foolishness mainly these winterfell captured bran and rickon dead their heads on display in winterfell catelyn grieves so much she loses her head and lets their captive go robb grieves and makes the mistake of marrying someone else the stark hope was turning into a massive trainwreck i was speechless and furious and disappointed at how awful everything was turning out but now in the tv series not so much my expected trainwreck of emotions didnt arrive all because they decided to leave the deaths of bran and rickon out of the equation of the others decisions i never thought i would criticize any of the changes until this came"

"Bride of Winter",2012-05-23,"yes but it is his honour in actually marrying the girl he has sex with that is what brings him undoneit doesnt really matter why he has sex  with some sympathetic girl stranger out of grief for his brothers or because he has fallen in love with another woman the bottom line plotwise is that his stark sense of honour leads him to marry that woman and by doing so he breaks his oath to the freys which is what ultimately leads to the rw robb has also misjudged the deep hatreds and insecurities of walder frey of course i agree that one of the tragedies of robbs story is that despite everything he has done all his early successes on the battlefield and being acclaimed as king of the north the wheels start to fall off very rapidly the terrible irony is that this is really caused not by his enemies but by the starks  catelyn and robb himself as the entire jeyne story takes place off screen as it were in the books i really dont care that they have given us talisajeyne because it makes sense in the context of a tv adaptation and because as ive said before her scenes also serve another wider purpose with respect to establishing aspects of robbs character that again we only hear about in the books and people who only watch the tv series are surely already getting the foreboding impression of things about to go terribly wrong once cat releases jaime because you can see and feel the rumbling dissatisfaction within the bannermen via the karstarks back in episode 7eta btw why all the angst over the tv writers having different impressions of robbs character if you read the various threads on the forum here about the books there is plenty of disgreement between avid book fans about how they see certain characters and the interpretation they put on events there is surely no one right way to see every single thing or person in the books  grrm writes shades of grey after all  so one has to be careful about suggesting they get things totally wrong its one thing to say that you dont like their interpretation of someone and explain your reasons but d and d are just as entitled as any other reader to their opinions and as we are watching a work in progress its probably best to wait until certain arcs are completed on screen before condemning them so completelyfor example i dont like the fact that they had jaime kill alton but i also accept that this is how they see his character and also how they wish to show various developments later i will wait until it all plays out on screen before making my final assessment as to whether they have been successfulim less upset about how he went about sleeping with her though i would rather them keep it consistent with it being out of grief im more angry about the issue with marriage it poses maybe im just being pessimistic but it seems pretty set in stone hes going to marry her for love now and its not like theyre simply building up what we didnt see in the books so their marriage seems realistic  the point in the books is that their marriage is completely out of the blue it doesnt have to be a realistic love story because there is no love story they just turn up and are married but its believable because the point is that they really didnt love each other at least before the marriage and theyre not a perfect couple it would be unrealistic if they fell and love and got married in the matter of a few days but thats not the case its not like grrm forgot to develop their relationship or anything their imperfect relationship and unlikely marriage stand to make the point that robb rushed to marry her because lacking foresight he thought it would solve all of their problems but it just created more but thats a crucial part of who robb is as a character he thinks making the honorable decisions will solve all of his problems and it fucks him over in the end and to your last comment i think its an issue with the medium you can sort of interpret the books however you want but when the writers interpret the series a certain way to make the show theyre definitively saying this is who robb is its much more tangible thing so its hard to watch a portrayal you dont agree witheta sorry i went on a bit of a tangent hopefully some of it addressed what you said edited by bride of winter 23 may 2012  0214 pm"
"_Oberyn_",2012-05-23,"also someone else mentioned this and so did my husband having her be talisa some unknown camp follower from volantis makes his screwing around with her a lot more believable he probably thinks hell just have sex with her and then still go on to do his duty and marry the horrible frey girl anyways if in fact shes still going to be revealed as jeyne westerling in the next episode or the finale and he feels honor bound to marry her at that point it still makes sense and flows with the story as written by martinso he feels honor bound to marry someone who has told him nothing but lies since the moment they met"
"protar",2012-05-23,"oberyn pretty much theyve really got themselves into a corner here if talisa isnt jeyne theres no reason for robb to marry her for fear of dishonouring her if she is jeyne then theres no reason for him to ever trust her again"
"Bride of Winter",2012-05-23,"what i dont understand though is that they went to the crag which hbo has made clear is still the seat of house westerling and nothing happened if she was ever going to be revealed as jeyne id have expected it to be there not to mention how are they going to explain jeyne westerling going to her own castle and not being noticed"
"Gannicus",2012-05-23,"i dont believe the show has ruined robbs character at all the books dont go into much if any detail about jeyne and robbs relationship or even what is going on in robbs head a lot of the readers seem to presume to know what robbs feeling and thinking in the novel to me i always envisioned robb hormones raging fell for some beautiful girl in a similar way he has in the show do we expect more from him one thing i do believe we know is young men even kings and starks tend to fall to the vices of flesh even though he has fallen for talisa im sure he still plans to carry out his duty to the frey girl despite his misgivings that is until he gets her pregnant i fail to see the major deviation from the novel as far as the talisajeyne thing we still dont know all of the details to her story in the books i presume the writers at hbo know more than us and are making these changes for a reason considering the time and budget constraints their changes have been good for the most part"
"Morrigan",2012-05-23,"count me in as one who was sure that the crag was mentioned just so wed know talisa would be exposed as jeyne at this point i have no idea why they even mentioned it perhaps to troll book readersi am now convinced that dd neither understand or respect the source materialagreed either that or they do love and respect the source material but they got so carried away with their adaptation fanfiction that they are completely losing sight of what the story and characters are supposed to bepeople who are mad at the robbtalisa storyline arent necessarily book purists by any means honestly in the show theyre pretty much completely negating the point book robb stands to make the red weddings a huge plot point yes but its not the point of robbs story his arc isnt he fucks up and then theres a really awesome massacre robbs arc is about how he goes from having everything going for him to losing his bannermen one by one and driving some to betrayal the point isnt that he dies but why winning every battle and losing the war would have no meaning if his betrayal came out of nowhere its how he arrived there that matters and theres a difference between being consumed by your naive and idealistic vision of honor and not cut out for the game of thrones book robb and being reckless dumb and inconsiderate show robb robb is not just a plot device to bring on the red wedding believe it or not hes his own character with his own storythank youif you havent seen it heres a transcription i did of weisss comment robbs sense of honor and ideals are built on his father and mother both hes fighting this war and his mother has just done something terrible in his eyes and makes him wonder why are you following this code to the letter and why are you so committed to loyalty honor dignity duty to the exclusion of all else when nobody else around you really is is it a smart thing to do or a stupid thing his father was that way what happened to his father it all becomes too much all of the different promises youve made start to conflict with each other and something has to give somewhere robb definitely is hyperaware of what it would mean to break his oath to walder frey whats so great about talisa is she asks him deep probing questions forcing him to confront his own idealism in a critical way he finds challenging makes her much more attractive to him its almost a bit of realism seeping into his world an acknowledgement and recognition that people arent perfect sometimes your own wishes and your own desires and your own happiness do need to play a role in life i think there was crack in his world view and it lets these questions seep in a little bitthanks for this its not as bad as i feared with regards to the blaming cat thing but its still a completely stupid interpretation of the events robbs commitment to loyalty honour and duty has never faltered and there has never been a crack in the way they say it its actually why he ends up being a victim of the red wedding he screwed up the war because of his nedlike insistence to uphold honour in this case the honour of the maiden he deflowered in a moment of weakness and as someone else stated robb didnt want to be challenged especially not by a random stranger hes a king every time theres a debate even before he was king in the north he would say things like this  what does lord stannis have against that that we should cast it all asideâ<U+0080><U+009D>â<U+0080><U+009C>the rightâ<U+0080><U+009D> said robb stubbornly catelyn thought he sounded eerily like his father as he said itwhich might have made sense if robb hadnt been actively pursuing talisa long before this this is what makes me think they dont know what theyre doing they dont know how to make the characters consistent with their own vision of themi agree with this we see more evidence in other characters such as jaime and cersei cersei goes from soft oh no our sins my joffs insane looks ready to cry to vicious i have your little whore if joffrey dies i will torture her to death blah blah blah in completely inconsistent ways edited by morrigan 23 may 2012  0323 pm"

"Bride of Winter",2012-05-23,"and as someone else stated robb didnt want to be challenged especially not by a random stranger hes a king every time theres a debate even before he was king in the north he would say things like thisi completely agree this is a really important point too because while i can see where some aspects of robb may be questionable because hes not a pov character i can safely say he would never fall for a girl because she challenges him honestly making talisa some fiery enigma of a woman who robbs drawn to because shes the only person who speaks out against him is almost laughable above all robb needs to make it known that hes the king hes already scrutinized enough by the rest of the world especially his fathers bannermen day after day hes on edge trying to prove that he isnt the green boy everyone says he is and hell even catelyns been questioning his involvement in the war since book one between fact that hes already surrounded by people who criticize him almost constantly and the fact that  lets face it  hes a bit immature he would never willingly subject himself to people questioning his ability to rule in his spare time forget how unlikely it is that talisa can get close to the king in the first place  once she starts making him question himself he wouldnt give her the time of day let alone fall in love with herthis is what pisses me off the most  the writers take on robb is even worse because its ridiculously inconsistent i cant even definitively say what theyre turning robb into because hes all over the place first they overstate his maturity by giving some of catelyns decisions to him and eliminating the whole boyking theme which is what makes his arc stand out then they age him down 10 years and turn him into a petulant brat sleeping with jeyne because he doesnt want to honor his pact with the freys right after yelling at his mother for freeing jaime no less and then apparently were back to him being more mature and patient than 99 of westeros willing to listen to the insults some camp follower has to spew about the way hes running his war just because hes never heard anyone speak to him like this before oh please edited by bride of winter 23 may 2012  0357 pm"

"SerMixalot",2012-05-23,"yes but they could have had the same interaction with roose and robb without the talisa plot basically the same scenes i think the key is why they havent revealed br supposed deaths by this point the key to understanding this season may lie in why this has not yeet been revealed i dont understand it"
"Sixshells",2012-05-23,"it seems to go back to not having cat and robb hear about the death of br which i simply cant understand at this point in the showim beginning to think it has to do with the fact that that they want to save up theons fake death for the last episode or at the least the episode before that so as to finish the season with a wham cliffhanger note since ramsay still hasnt taken winterfell and theon has it under a communications blackout there is no way for cat and robb to learn about the death of the children but since they had to move along their stories they had to entirely rework their motivations and their dynamics to still keep robbs marrying someone else and cat sending jaime to kl"

"The Meeraculous Third Reed",2012-05-25,"i find it much more human and realistic to think of robb allowing himself to forget his duty and fall in love with talisa if robb is going to put the entire war at risk he at least ought to do it for a very human need and madness with which we can all sympathizeno the whole point is that robb ought not to do it for basic human lust because of the responsibilities placed upon him because of his title and his lineage also the book version of events gives us a far greater reason to sympathise with robb namely that his brothers had been killed by a man he believed was one of his closest friends we also i imagine sympathise and respect his decision not to leave jeyne deflowered and in a position of being a woman who slept with the enemywhereas hbo robb has been set up for the audience to empathise with as im sure that in all our lives we have been in a position where urges have perhaps been the more attractive but less honourable option creating a somewhat subtle but at the same time substantial difference the point is we are not meant to empathise with robb for the most part robb is the newly appointed 17 year old king of a fractured feudal society a society which places huge importance upon family history and for lack of a better word purity we cannot empathise with robb imoas such the decision is stylistic i may be overanalysing this but imo the audience is treated with better respect when we are left to sympathise with robb as opposed to empathise it weakens robbs character"
"teemo",2012-05-25,"some people dont think this was a major book change that it didnt really change the overall plot well what is the overall plot anyway its a bunch of plots all weaved together revolving around who rules westeros and the others i think changing robb starks behavior to this much of a degree and in part changing jeyne so much can definitely be considered a major deviation from the book and not for the better robb isnt a poor 15 year old that is injured and being taken care of by a lovely young maiden who he deflowered and decides to do whats in his opinion the honorable thing tv robb is just a healthy grown man wandering around camp with this random girl thats infuriating everyone because hes spending all of his time with her and the war is now an afterthought i would say thats a major book deviation and he dies next season so there really is no wiggle room here for redemption or change or anything he is stuck with this annoying girl in a cliche cheesy uncharacteristic storyline pretty much up until his death now another entire season of talisarobbawesome its really annoying when this was seriously one of the biggest things i was looking forward to this season and its turned into a nightmare"

"RSasoiaf",2012-05-25,"there are so many inconsistencies with both characters that i do not understand those who try to say this is better story telling compared to the books one thing is to say that it still looks good and it still is good tv no one will go against that i think the show is still quite enjoyable but pleaseit kills me to see some people who say things like this is better or that grrm was the one who made the mistake peoplelook at robb from the show  look at how he reacts to theon when they are discussing if the north should go to war does that look like someone who will take it well to be questioned nope  look at robb when the great john questions his decisions does that look like someone who will tolerate any complains or alternative plans nope  look at robb when his mother tries to tell him she wants to go home and theon should not be sent to the iron islands does robb seems to enjoy this does he take any advice from his mother nope now please tell us why the hell would someone like this enjoy a girl questioning him in an open field and close to some of his soldiers  lords and now we have the girl  first she is introduced as a nurse that roams around the batlefield and has some sort of issue against war and against robb invading the westerlandsif she is foreign what does she care about the westerlands and if she is a foreign nurse why does she take one side of the conflict over the other or are we to believe that she did the same complaints to tywin or to gregor clegane now that would have been fun  next episode she is writting some letters all alone in robbâs camp why is she staying with robbâs army on the previous episode it looked like she had just left and she did not want to work for the north so why is she with them now did they arrest her or keep her there against her will did she decide to change sides in the meanwhile why she did not seem like she wanted to change sides the first time we did meet her and by the way she is now quite a bit less sassy in general and again what is she doing all alone with the northern army who protects her who keeps her safe gives her food and stops her from being rapped is it robb why would he  then we go another episode and now she has a position in which she can ask robb for supplies is she now the main nurse and responsible for that kind of stuff since when how did she get that kind of position is she such a good nurse that robb decided to take her and make her like the armyâs maester dont they have the silent sisters who should really be doing that kind of work can anyone explain why a military leader would pick a foreigner who clearly said she was playing for the other side and take this lady to lead your medical services for your army why does she even trust her asking for provisions that could be really dangerous if she ends up being a turncoat and how does he know she isnt ahhhand it is still weird how she can be all alone and safe toying around a foreign armyyeahhhh  and finally we have kind of confirmation that the girl seems to be really a foreigner and she is all sweet and bla bla bla she loves her brother and bla bla blawellwhat is she doing so far away from her brother then and i dont buy it that she cant live on a slaver citywell cant she complain about that to her brother and family thus trying to solve the slave problem there how is she doing anything good for the slaves by running away to take care of soldiers you would expect someone like her would be more like a village nurse and not a field army nurseor she should be a slave nurse back home taking care of the slaves and doing her best to help them live better and now just try and place this noble girl going all out on a foreign king which she gets to know is already engagedshe even gets to know that the engagement is quite important besides she is supposed to be against the very thing he represents which is a leader who is going to war over something she does not understandor at least that was her mindset 3 episodes agoi guess it doesnt matter anymore you seethe only way for all of this to fit together is if she is just another spoiled brat that just does whatever she feels like on the spot without that much inner tought about it"

"Gannicus",2012-05-26,"i will remind you again the book story was possible maybe not that easy to happen but it was possible the show story is impossible unless something is really messed up with the whole worldhow do you figure a young man cant be turned on unless hes weak and vulnerableso the book story is maybe a bit cheesy the show story is 100 cheesy simply because it depicts things that are not at even plausible in the worldagainin the book robb was weak is was being taken care at the cragg and by a sweet and shy girl you probably know nothing about being in pain and having a really nice nurse taking care of you but you probably know that the nurse thing is still a big big fantasy even in this day and age and i could take the time to further explain why make it simple there is a lot of sexual charge when you are helpless and being taken care off by someone young and nice looking it is believable then things happen and robb kind of really feels sorry for jeyne do to her being so sweet and shy she is totally screwed if he doesnt marry her and do to her personality robb really feels pittyit fits you will pitty someone who is really sweet and shy itâs also almost unavoidable you will feel moved and want to help someone like thatnow in the show we have a girl that should not be there in the first place that should not be allowed to be with robb that should not be able to go around free and happy in an army camp in that day and age remember she was an enemy nurse and she doesnt bellong to the official red cross silent sisters soshe is 100 impossible she could not be there she would not be allowed to be there and she would not remain there if she had the choiceso the king of the north feels sorry for a girl he boned and thats the reason he marries her yeah i find that to be both unrealistic and pathetic hes wounded and depressed and the poor baby has sex with a hot nurse thank god the show didnt try to portray that cheese fest having robb actually fall for a girl is a better story and more believable story because here is what is actually true when every day above ground could be your last men have a tendency not to worry about the repercussions of their actions i dont know how many of you have seen action but when men go to war with the possibility of death looming they tend to put vows on the backburner this happens much more frequently than a nurse and patient getting it on i dont see it hard to imagine rob getting it on with a pretty girl he has a crush on low born or highnow i agree the show has failed to capture a strong love story adequately but i guess thats what happen when you get medieval gurus trying to write love stories pure cheese"

with book robb its certainly not inconsistent with the portrayal of tv robb so far â i agree that he fell in love in both book and the show i dont understand why people insist that bookrobb didnt love jeyne when he says so multiple times and catelyn never doubts it and if he hadnt loved her he would have been a complete idiot to marry her just because he slept with her its not like he needed to protect her honor when she was not pregnant and nobody would have known that they had slept together its not like faith would have come to check on her if she is still a virgin she could have just kept her mouth shut and eventually married someone else robb did not need even to marry her off as some have suggested that happens when a girl gets pregnant or gives birth and its impossible to hide what happened besides robb himself believed he was putting jeyne and her family in danger as well because they would be exposed to the wrath of the lannisters so it would not have been a good solution to jeyne either to be put in danger and confined to a loveless marriage to a man who would resent her for screwing up his war plans for nothing â however if robb and jeyne were in love then it all makes emotional sense i dont think he would have just decided to marry her if he hadnt slept with her but since he was in love and he had slept with her i can see why he felt it was the right thing to do â i do however think that they messed up robb and his storyline on the show i like book robb much more and find him more sympathetic show robb is boring and a bit annoying the main differences are imo â  showrobb is not just a few years older and looking like hes 10 years older than bookrobb hes also written as a guy who simply does whatever he wants and doesnt worry about the consequences i suppose they did it to make him look more of a conventional badass hero but it just makes him less interesting and less sympathetic than bookrobb who is 15 confused in over his head unsure if what hes doing is right and apologetic when he talks to his mother now theres nothing they could have done about richard madden looking his age but they certainly could have made him more conflicted between love and duty at the very least showrobb never seemed conflicted at all â  bookrobb also thinks he may die and makes precautions unlike showrobb who acts like he believes hes invincible the latter actually makes the 15year old bookrobb look more mature â  speaking of bookrobb being apologetic and subtly manipulating his mother into forgiving him for marrying jeyne by implying he will forgive her for releasing jaime because those two things were both mistakes made out of love thats very different from showrobb who scolds his mother harshly imprisons her and then goes on to marry talisa basically saying fuck it im pissed at her so now going to do whatever i want which made him look like a jerk and a petulant idiot â  the romance between robb and talisa was incredibly boring it was like the most conventional shallowest third rate hollywood romance movie about two hot college kids who fall for each other immediately because theyre both hawt and because shes sassy and hes badass â  speaking of which both of them separately were also written like completely anachronistic characters with modern views robb scolding his mother for arranging the marriage with a frey girl was ridiculous writing â as a westerosi noble ending up in a political arranged marriage is what he would have always expected to be a part of his life its what all westerosi nobles do when we see characters deciding to marry for love or rejecting marriage altogether like blackfish or growing disillusioned with their fate of being married off for politics like sansa or feeling resentful of having been stuck in bad arranged marriages like cersei or lysa its a big deal its a huge change in their character that they only come to after a long process no noble in westeros starts off with the idea that they will be allowed to marry whoever they choose just because they lovewant them â maybe they thought it would make robb and his wife more relatable but it only made them and their storyline less interesting and more jarring â  as a consequence of talisa being written as such an anachronistic modern woman showrobb looks like an even bigger idiot i can see why bookrobb thought he had to marry jeyne and why her family probably would have easily convinced him he had to do it quickly in addition jeyne probably wouldnt have been ok with being his mistress  even if she was up for it her reputation would have suffered and she wouldnt want to give birth to a bastard but talisa doesnt seem to care about any of that and never expresses any concern that shed be seen as a fallen woman and robb doesnt express that concern for her either so why does robb need to marry her asap she could have continued being his mistress throughout the war if they were going by carpe diem we could be dead tomorrow if he was determined to marry for love he could have also married her after the war was won when he had no need of the freys so badly anymore he would have still broken his vow to walder frey and looked like an ass for screwing him over though i doubt many people would even care for him screwing over walder frey of all people but he would not have lost the war and his life but why oh why was it so necessary to marry talisa asap while he was still in dire need of the freys oddly enough they both made robb anachronistically modern and then they made him conservative for a 21st century person in that one instance must marry the woman i love and am sleeping with asap so he does not come off as a believable westerosi who expects to marry for politics no love and he also does not come off as someone relatable to the average 21st century tv viewer who does not think they have to immediately marry someone theyre having a relationship with â  there are other things unrelated to talisa that made showrobb annoying i couldnt believe it when they kept having blackfish who was also made to be really annoying as they turned him into a bully and a total robb yesman at the same time bully edmure by telling him he is your king while simultaneously having robb say that he doesnt care about the riverlands you know the riverlands thats been bleeding the most from the

"Nine of Spades",2012-05-21,"everyone ive spoken to who is a fan of the show but hasnt read the books really enjoys jon hes their one of their favorite chracters their sentiments havent changed in season 2 and even though hes been less than impressive this season or less impressive than he was in cok it doesnt make them like him any less or make them think hes an idiot thats only hardcore book fans who are complaining that his character is somehow ruined bc he allowed himself to get surprised by craster and allowed ygritte to take him a few times hes out in the wild by himself for the first time lost his older ranger support crew and hes supposed to be a badass thats why they got rid of ghost for the time being to show the vulnerability of jon he has or had hardcore notions about honor like every other stark in the show ned rob arya sansa and they are going to get challenged by the real world ygritte ripping jon was part of that i dont really see how the character arc is dramatically changed who said anything about the changes to littlefinger and tyrion enhancing their arcs i was speaking of snow who needs to get beat up a bit and shit on as the green boy that he is before he becomes the steely leader he will become i just dont see how these changes ruin jonhes been training for his entire life to do exactly what hes doing now its pretty much medieval knighthood 101 he is 100 in his element at this point in the story whats more while some people think jon is just a regular joe hes definitely not this isnt a kid whose had a carefree easy going life hes someoen who has been trained to a very specific job and do it very well and he is doing that job its exactly the reason robb can outfox tywin lannister they arent green boys they are highly trained young men who are doing exactly the things they trained fornow thats not to say that jon and robb dont make mistakes because they do but they mistakes they make are not for lack of competence but lack of wisdom and foresight jon in trying to run off when news of eddards death his initial attitude toward the other trainees his initial attitude at being named a steward or in his failure to see the other officers of the nw plotting against him and in each case well except the last one he tends to learn his lessons quicklytv show jon on the otherhand shows basic incompetence he doesnt think through the consequences of sparing ygritte he begs to go on a ranging when in the books at that point he knows and accepts his duties and moreover understands and agrees with the logic behind it he also shows instances of courage and competency in the books hes not just there for the ride but hes showing actual abilitybut ultimately what drives me nuts is that i think its made pretty clear in the book that jon a pretty stoic guy hes always had a pretty large amount of misfortune heaped up on him the reason that that he can hold the wall after noyes death the reason sam pyp and grenn look to him the reason that he is the lord commander who can stand up to stannis is because outwardly the guy is just a pillar of strengththe mary sue comparisons drive me nuts because he doesnt do things blindly thinking that hes going to do the right thing and its going to work out for the best because hes good he does things where he knows the very real very serious consequences that coud result and he chooses to do them anywaysthere is something deeply fatalistic about jons character that the tv series doesnt even come close to capturingand thats actually the biggest gripe i have about the qhorin plotline turn jon would have easily preferred to fight with qhorin against the wildlings to the death he doesnt have any hopes or dreams for himself doesnt dare to allow himself to have them and thats what makes stanniss offer of winterfell so seductive the dream is something he cant have instead jon selects duty dishoner in the case of the wildlings and what looks like deathi mean the one unquestionably sweet and pure thing he has in his adult life with the exception of his bond with ghost perhaps is ygrittes love and he indirectly kills her for duty edited by nine of spades 21 may 2012  1146 pm"

"TheWanderer",2012-05-22,"its emasculating to take someone captive then have them set you up then make you their prisoner then have her say shes gonna cut your balls off if you run its emasculating to have someone take your own sword and beat your ass with it its emasculating to have to beg to go ranging as opposed to being selected by the best ranger for his team 3 examples if deviations that make snow look bad for no reasonthere are reasons though why should qhorin want jon on his team because hes a pov character or a stark its certainly not because hes a ranger or an old hand at combat or has displayed any sort of trackingwildernesscombat ability yes craster gets the jump on jon and smacks him across the face so crasters a wildling and an oldish one at that and my guess is hes got a wee bit more experience at moving silently than jon plus jons clearly pretty shockedconfused by what hes seeing and isnt focused on potential threats and ygrittes character is pretty much the same as in the books she talks a big game in front of the other wildlings and does actually have some skill and knowledge of the landscape which is what jon fundamentally lacksthese changes were all made to emphasize other parts of the story either ygrittes character without the capture chase capture sequence we really wouldnt know much about her the sacrifices or simply the fact that jon is still hungry for glory and is a bit of a noob the last time we saw ghost was when he was leaving wqhorin and jon tries to call ghost but ghost wont come and qhorin says its bc direwolves are wild  which to me was a blatant falsehood wrt their relationship to their owners the direwolves are connected to their masters  and that connection helps them know when their masters are in danger which is how they are almost always around to defend them here ghost should know where jon is or at the very least should be able to track him  not only that but getting captured is a time when jon would be feeling fearful which would immediately alert ghost to his need to come back and defend jon the lack of ghost at this point is a blatant plot hole that makes no sense1 how is qhorin supposed to know about the connection between the starks and their direwolves assuming it even is on the level you suggest2 maybe ghost doesnt feel like jon needs his help or is in no real danger jons expression upon capture seems to be more exasperation than fear and even once captured he doesnt seem particularly concerned that rattleshirts going to kill him maybe ghost can either sense that or sense that ygritte isnt a threat or hell really is busyhes been training for his entire life to do exactly what hes doing now its pretty much medieval knighthood 101 he is 100 in his element at this point in the storysorry but medieval knighthood 101 doesnt contain any lessons about wilderness survival dealing with sexy savages or pretty much anything else jons been going through knighthood is all about open combat codes of honour and the like which is exactly what jon is expressing hes been trained to fight and hes pretty good at it as seen in s1 but hes got no idea how to deal with girls or chase people down in the north nor would i expect him to robbs winning his war because hes been trained in how to lead armies and fight wars jons getting ropeadoped by a girl because he knows nothingthe mary sue comparisons drive me nuts because he doesnt do things blindly thinking that hes going to do the right thing and its going to work out for the best because hes goodmary sues dont necessarily assume things are going to work out because theyre good rather thats just how things happen jon is mary suelike in the books because everybody around him thinks hes awesome and for no real reason qhorin selects him for the ranging despite his being intensely underqualified mance makes him basically innercircle upon meeting him despite his being a traitor hes voted lord commander despite his being intensely underqualified true jon doesnt expect these things but they still happen and there isnt generally a good reason beyond hes a stark which is mary sue rationalization of the highest order"
"Eddard Sand",2012-05-22,"the experience of jons capture for me is the defining moment for his character the lessons he learns from his encounter with the wildlings and the subsequent love affair her has with ygritte are what make him the man that ultimately becomes lord commander in living with the wildlings he comes to understand what true leadership is about he sees the determiantion charisma and devotion of mance tormund and ygritte respectively and emulates these qualities when back on the wall then there is the sacrifice that qhorin makes which shows jon that no matter what he must achieve the goal of protecting the wall and those that live within the confines of its protection so until these life altering changes take place i am totally fine with jon bumbling about in the wilderness he is still a boy even while lord commander he still makes mistakes mistakes that in the end have him pseudoassassinated he is flawed but by no means emasculated sincerely eddard sand bastard of the boneway"
"summer_stark",2012-05-22,"the wanderer the falsehood i was referring to was the objective one  not qhorins view ie we are left with qhorins assertion as fact  based on two things  1 jon doesnt bother correcting him and 2 ghost doesnt come to jon then or at all upon rereading my post however i can see that it is easily interpreted the way you interpreted it  poorly worded on my part the point i was making was that direwolves are wild was the reason given to jon and the viewer as to why ghost doesnt follow  but to the viewer at a minimum its weird since ghost is pretty loyal  but to a nonbook reader  it might be just the way qhorin says it is  bc we have no real understanding of jon and ghosts connection at this point and to portray it that way is to convey the relationshipconnection falsely and to have jon fail to say no ghost isnt like that hes loyal etc furthers this view of qhorins as truth rather than opinion and his opinion is blatantly false but up til now we have no reason to doubt it to me it seems like dd put it in as a reason why ghost isnt around after that when it really is a terrible reason bc objectively its false  but considering the problems of cgi direwolves cost and the fact that they cant really interact wthe cast in a meaningful way wo seriously  it seems like this is how dd solved it  ie ghost is wild so he isnt going to come help jonand the idea that jon isnt in danger  from jons pov  strikes me as silly jon is in a dangerous situation  hes not too stupid or crazy to recognize it maybe hes not pissing his pants but this is the moment a direwolf comes to the rescue  when your master is captured you sense something is wrong and help any reasons re why ghost hasnt been around the past couple of episodes is justification not real reasoning that makes sense win the confines of the story"

"ghost the direwolf",2012-05-22,"jon and ghost have definitely lost their mojo what i fell sad about is the fact that we did not get this fabulous  warg connection between jon and ghost  the discovery of where all the widling were and jon explaining his dream to qhorin qhorin understanding what was going on with jon and calling him a warg the trees have eyes againect i was so looking forward to this edited by ghost the direwolf 22 may 2012  0620 am"
"SerMixalot",2012-05-22,"hes been training for his entire life to do exactly what hes doing now its pretty much medieval knighthood 101 he is 100 in his element at this point in the story whats more while some people think jon is just a regular joe hes definitely not this isnt a kid whose had a carefree easy going life hes someoen who has been trained to a very specific job and do it very well and he is doing that job its exactly the reason robb can outfox tywin lannister they arent green boys they are highly trained young men who are doing exactly the things they trained for now thats not to say that jon and robb dont make mistakes because they do but they mistakes they make are not for lack of competence but lack of wisdom and foresight jon in trying to run off when news of eddards death his initial attitude toward the other trainees his initial attitude at being named a steward or in his failure to see the other officers of the nw plotting against him and in each case well except the last one he tends to learn his lessons quickly tv show jon on the otherhand shows basic incompetence he doesnt think through the consequences of sparing ygritte he begs to go on a ranging when in the books at that point he knows and accepts his duties and moreover understands and agrees with the logic behind it he also shows instances of courage and competency in the books hes not just there for the ride but hes showing actual ability but ultimately what drives me nuts is that i think its made pretty clear in the book that jon a pretty stoic guy hes always had a pretty large amount of misfortune heaped up on him the reason that that he can hold the wall after noyes death the reason sam pyp and grenn look to him the reason that he is the lord commander who can stand up to stannis is because outwardly the guy is just a pillar of strength the mary sue comparisons drive me nuts because he doesnt do things blindly thinking that hes going to do the right thing and its going to work out for the best because hes good he does things where he knows the very real very serious consequences that coud result and he chooses to do them anywaysthere is something deeply fatalistic about jons character that the tv series doesnt even come close to capturing and thats actually the biggest gripe i have about the qhorin plotline turn jon would have easily preferred to fight with qhorin against the wildlings to the death he doesnt have any hopes or dreams for himself doesnt dare to allow himself to have them and thats what makes stanniss offer of winterfell so seductive the dream is something he cant have instead jon selects duty dishoner in the case of the wildlings and what looks like death i mean the one unquestionably sweet and pure thing he has in his adult life with the exception of his bond with ghost perhaps is ygrittes love and he indirectly kills her for duty agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree well stated"
"SerMixalot",2012-05-22,"also its not like the wildlings dont capture jon and qhorin in the books they just do it differently and earlier in the showthe difference is in the book he was captured under orders otherwise he would probably have fought to the death he certainly spoke of willingness to do so"

"Morvran",2012-05-22,"im holding faith in the writers i have to because if they mess up jons thread in the longterm then theyve messed up the whole series so im holding faith that they chose to focus on ygritte this season in order to have her story arch hold more weight for nonreaders next season they added her scenes with jon bc theyre going to remove some of their future romance building scenes next season to focus more on the action they will show his development into a leader and fighter next season ghost will get face time next year i actually hold little faith in this as they seem to have dropped all the wolves from prominence which really ticks me off"

"Morvran",2012-05-22,"im getting a little tired of this argument as well and how much hes going to develop next season first of all the latter is a total cop out he should be developing the entire time not backtrackingrespectfully i dont think its a cop out or to specify i think the decision by the writers could be justifiedlet me start by saying i love jons story in the books and am annoyed by how the series has adapted it to the screen im really annoyed that my girlfriend hates when they switch to the snow scenes more than any other settingeven more than when they cut to qarth i want her to love jons story like i do but all the meat has been cut out leaving hardly more than a few scraps of boneok that said i dont think its farfetched to watch his development take a step back in his new setting even if you take into account all the points you made about his role last season he wasnt ready to be a ranger even if he was sure he was ready and now were seeing just how not ready he was lets face it ned stark would have made a horrible ranger and jon has too much of his father in him to be able to just jump into the role and run with it hes too questioning too green too sympathetic and still not accepting enough of his role as a man of the nights watch just as he was getting comfortable behind the wall he was dragged further north and hes out of his element againif theres any major fault i find with the writers right now its that theyve written no sense of foreboding into the area beyond the wall to nonreaders in particular i think it looks like a bunch of men wandering around in the snow that landscape is bleak but save the one babystealing scene theres very little for a viewer to hold on to and then theres the whole ghost vanishing thinganyway sometimes a character develops best when it takes a few steps back and as long as they have jon take giant leaps forward next season i can roll with this one"
"lmanion",2012-05-22,"on the whole i am pretty pleased with the adaptation from books to tv but this is the one thing that bugs me each and every time we see jon for me they have totally screwed his arc in clash in the book he has a good enough reputation that qhorin chooses him to accompany him he then has a rather significant development imo that is completely left out and that is his warging of ghost and discovering the wildling host then his scene where qhorin orders him to turn his cloak in the show it just seems to be oh no jons on screen he is about to screw up again and get himself and others into more trouble and ghost isnt even there to help him out in the books by far the most boring parts for me were from the greyjoys in the show unfortunately i seem to be adding jon to that the rest of the adaptation is great i just cant stand the butchering of jon in this series so far"
"scurvy",2012-05-22,"it was critical in the books that jon warged with ghost found the weirwood in the milkwater and talked to bran from the dark it let us know that bran wasnt truly dead and that jon had warging powers now jon not only knows nothing he is nothing"
"LeananKite",2012-05-22,"for me its not a big deal who found the dragonglass and as sam is the one who slaughters the other just give him the honour to find the dragonglass to who cares and finding it by digging shitholes is a nice movement i think the time of aging up for jon is still to come even in the books he is forced to kill quorin to go with mance then abandons ygrittethese are hard decisions for him and he grows on them afterwards he organizes the defense of the wall against the ygritte companie and then against mance i think his caracter has still time to grow up so perhaps nothing is lost besides some boring scenes in this episode edited by leanankite 22 may 2012  1046 am"

"Hear me Meow",2012-05-22,"i agree with the op concerning the changes between jon snow and jon show in the second season however i dont think dampampampd are being as inconsistent as some people think jon show was never really much like jon snow even in the first season its just that he did roughly the same kind of stuff and had most of the same lines so book readers didnt always note the very profound differences personally i think dampampampd made it clear in the very first episode that jon show was an emasculated weaker version of his book counterpart in the novel the first chapter consists of grrm having bran beat us round the head with what a precocious serious snarky and silvertongued fourteen year old jon snow is jon dominates the scene where they find the wolf pups he is portrayed as bright and sweet as well as composed and even somewhat haughty all his lines are there to tell us about his character in the show jon delivers his lines about why they should keep the wolves and about his not being a stark in as unremarkable a way as possible indeed they sound like exposition rather than character points even if this was just the way harington wanted to play it dampampampd rob jon of his best line i think not greyjoy and instead have theon give him ghost honestly jon getting ghost from theon is practically the equivalent of being raped and to make it worse theon mocks him while he is at it and jon show has no comeback in the novels of course he rides back alone having heard ghost scrabbling and finds his own wolf putting theon down who was five years his senior with an icy stare and a line that dripped of cool composure in the show there is a soul destroying shot of jon holding little ghost with a rather less than masterful expression on his face the kindest way to put it examples could be multiplied but suffice to say this does establish a trend whereby jon show finds himself right at the bottom of the food chain in terms of wit and composure in the novels right after the first chapter he was the stark child to watch out for in the show dampampampd showed us jons new place on all fours on his belly getting owned by theon greyjoy basically this is all by way of saying that i dont think jon show was ever really the same character as jon snow he was always less quickwitted snarky and competent a man who was the shadow of the boy he was in the books some of this perhaps most of it is down to the age difference in the show he cant look younger than twenty and jon snow is well written in the novels as a fourteen year old the rest is due to the character being changed to the same extent as show cat differs from book cat jon shows behaviour in season 2 is therefore in line with his character in season 1 i think to a greater extent than people are willing to give dampampampd credit for edit having just watched the finding of the direwolves again i need to point out that i was totally wrong to say jon gets given ghost by theon he does find him himself in an admittedly underwhelming way compared to the book but theon does mock him the runt of the litter that ones yours snow and jon show does lack a comeback quite unlike the books in the books im pretty sure theon says the runt of the litter its sure to die soon in the show theon kind of apportions ghost to jon in a way he doesnt in the books by telling jon ghost is his wolf while in the books this one is mine is a very forceful line delivered by jon himself theon doesnt hand jon ghost though and i was in error here although i think the basic point still stands also in the books im pretty sure ned asks jon why there is no wolf for him and he says im not a stark to ned making the statement more dramatic in the show the line is very subdued almost cowed and he just says it to bran so it has less affect please do correct me if im wrong here edited by procopius 25 may 2012  0150 pm"

"Hear me Meow",2012-05-22,"my opinion is that jon snow in the series was true to the inexperienced naive way they portrayed him in the books during season one and then somewhere along the line in season two theyve forgotten to age him up and let him start becoming more of the man he will have to be by the time the entire nights watch falls on his shouldersi think its undeniable that they did capture his inexperience in the first season as well as his sullen nature and his angst all very important facets of jons character in the first book trouble is though that was all they managed to portray and very significant elements of book jon were lost there are a number of reasons for this but the most salient is simply the decision to age him up perhaps im more hung up on the original ages than most but i thought jon really worked as a fourteen year old i like some teenage angst but it ceases to be in anyway cute endearing or sympathetic when portrayed by a twentyfour year oldcrucially it makes show jon look pretty immature and even underdeveloped i always got the contrary impression from jon snow in the books if you bore his age in mind when reading his chapters he seemed to cope very well for the most part and his mistakes didnt detract all that much from his intelligence or his decent character at the beginning of the book he was established as mature for his age both benjen and luwin agreed with this and that aspect of him is lost completely simply by having a twenty four year old play him if show jon actually looked anything like the character from the books he would be much more impressive i think he was master of the training yard when he must have been one of the youngest men there grown men and late teens ended up being led by a little teenager age him up and his natural abilities and the training he received at winterfell that made him a precocious nascent leader all vanishthere might be no help for this although given they were so willing to make character changes elsewhere you might have though they would be a bit more eager to undo the damage caused by giving a twenty four year old lines written for a fourteen year oldeven if this was no good through a series of alterations and omissions to jons story in the series in particular but not only the opening scene with the direwolf pups they made him a less impressive character than the boy in the books kind of like rubbing salt in the wound i thought he was at his most impressive at castle black in book one when he persuaded aemon to ask for sam as his steward so he would be passed on from ser alliser this was really the only time he did something bright without prompting and while they couldnt do every scene this one would i think have done most to remedy the unfortunate impression they created that jon is not very brightnow i dont want to be nasty to kit harington he is a good actor very committed to the show and a fan of the books too i just dont think he is very good at getting across jons budding leadership qualities or his intelligence emilia clarke on the other hand seems to handle dany very well in this respect perhaps im just not a fan of the accent dampampd make him do but his delivery fails to convey any sense that he is talented and a natural leader to me anyway also more than any other character he undergoes a lot of tutelage and he never looks very clever while this is happening i just dont think his expressions really show him learning and pondering what he has been told and i think book jon was a thoughtful character show jon looks dopey actually this is a substantial understatement loads of people seem not to mind so maybe this is not such a big deal it seems very jarring to mebut yeah while jons inexperience sure did transition to the screen not much else did for this reason i dont agree that dampampds characterization this season is that out in the show jon is unquestionably the stupidest of the stark children and this is just being brought out this season he isnt this way in the books but he was never the same character even from the start i think the changes to jon this season from the books show dd being perceptive about the new characters that have been created by the adaptation they are thinking on their feet about how to develop jon realistically now that he is very different to the way he was in the book edited by procopius 22 may 2012  1026 pm"

"SerMixalot",2012-05-22,"i respectfully disagree i believe that jon had alot of loving male figures in his life growing up they may not have been soft girlie men they ar e northerners but clearly they loved jon ser rodik and luwin asmuch as ned in their own ways now obviously a stoic winter is coming northerner is going to be grim but the love is there demonstrated by the harsh life lessons taught it is jon which instructs bran to watch the beheading showing that jon has been taught a similar lesson by ned et al in the past jon was raised by the men of winterfell as an equal to robb and bran and was affectionate with his sisters esp arya it was cat that rejected him and kept him at a distance but that does not mean the love that ned or ser rodrik or luwin showed jon was just dutiful that it was less than real or at least i am not aware of any evidence to that end"
"victim",2012-05-22,"im still holding on to hopes that this story can be rectified i think a redemptive arc could be in full swing by the end of the season if  say for example qhorin reiterates the failure jon has been north of the wall giving him his one final task to infiltrate the wildlings and bring them down from within by the time qhorin is dead and jon joins the wildlings his redemption arc would already be well under way as long as season 3 reinforces the fact that jon was the one who saved the entire watch by returning after the queenscrown incident i think theres enough basis to show his leadership abilities at the same time im worried theyll pull a donnie brasco and it will seem as if jon has become a wildling when really all they have to do is show jon realising hey these wildlings arent as bad as i thought theyd be but there still my enemy if they show the wildlings as horrible people when jon lets them through the wall it will be the pinnacle of idiocy in fact jons movements in book 5 were smart its just his brothers didnt think so"
"Ghost714",2012-05-22,"while these figures are all strong men im not sure any of them would have been father figures to jon a father is more than a guiding hand and lifelessons theres supposed to be love there as well im not sure that ned ever really showed jon affection and i think the fact that such a strong potential father figure was there and they didnt connect would eat at jonjon learned in season 1 how to relate with other people his age these next two seasons hes going to learn how to command them mormont criticizes jon for not being able to look the other way but thats not something he wouldve ever learned before i have no doubt that ned would teach hes sons to protect the weak but i seriously doubt he would teach them that discretion is occasionally the better part of valour as he himself fails at this so jon is learning something new this season its not a retread of stuff he should know so its not emasculating in my opinionnone of these things require maturity or wisdom he is a good sword fighter because he was trained to be this is also how he killed the wight and at least initially why his peers respected him as far as being selected as the lcs steward that means that people think he has the potential to be a great leader and he does not that he is ready to do so now if mormont thought jon was ready to lead then he wouldnt have to groom him for the positionno they didnt they showed him getting slightly better becoming a man is not a simple step up its a long and gradual process yes jon no longer thinks hes better than his brothers why does that mean he is now no longer ignorant of anythingi didnt take the statement as a boast certainly not one about being better than other rangers jon was trying to get mormont and the halfhand to give him a chance to prove himself its actually in line with his previous character development to in s1 jon wouldve said he deserved to go because of who he is this season he tries to show them that he is capable that he has fought this enemy and can defeat it its not im a bamf and deserve to be on this mission its i wont be a liability i can handle myself rememberi totally think goat fuckers is in line with qhorins thinking about the wildlings its not a slight against their religion or lack thereof its simply a statement about the way they live its even possible that its true i also find it interesting that ygritte is quick to suggest something similar about the nights watch qhorins been done quite well i think and im personally quite fine with the fact that the show went out and got good actors to play minor characters like him edd and others rather than blowing their money on cgiing direwolves into every scenewhen jon said i fought and killed a wight how many rangers can say that i dont know how it could be taken as anything but him boasting and i think the show confirmed that when they had mormont saying you also let an old man get the best of you and take your swordmormont said something like that also when jon is saying that he is definitely implying that he has done something that most rangers havent and it comes off like he is trying to say he is more qualified than most rangers because of it even though killing a wight is impressive that does not actually mean he would automatically be an awesome ranger hell sam killed an other and he would make a terrible ranger the jon in season one stopped thinking he was better than his fellow brothers in training and now in season two he thinks he is more qualified and in a way better than any ranger who has not fought and killed a wight i dont know how you can think that line was not showing jons incompetence because before jon left mormont said i hope you make a better ranger than you did a steward so mormont multiple times in just this one episode not to mention the craster episode has said things to jon about his incompetence as for show qhorin he is nothing like qhorin from acok physically and otherwise qhorin has a respect and understanding for the wildlings he still fights them but he does not hate them in the book qhorin was a more solemn soft spoken kind of guy despite him being a rather big but slender guy qhorin from the books would never say now come on lets go find these goat fuckers qhorin was like mance when mance was still a brother of the nights watch mance respected the wildlings and understood them he didnt view them like bowen marsh would on page 764 of the paperback edition of acok qhorin says only fools like thoren smallwood despise the wildlings they are as brave as we are jon as strong as quick as clever but they have no discipline the qhorin who tells jon something like that is nothing like the qhorin who call the wildlings goat fuckersand that whole speech qhorin gave jon before they got to ygritte about how he does not want jon to be happy to die for the watch and how nobody would know jons name but he could know that he died to save someone south of the wall etc that whole speech wasnt really out of character for book qhorin the delivery was a little but that speech wasnt however at the end of the speech when qhorin asked jon if he understands and jon said yes then qhorin said then your even dumber than i thought its just words boy words to help us sleep at night thats not something qhorin would say he was all about giving his life for the watch and he even said thats why they do what they do in the books book qhorin would never ridicule jon for saying he understands after he just went into this big rant to explain something to jon only to say it was all a bunch of bullshiti am not saying the actor playing qhorin is bad i am saying the writing for him is bad"

"Hear me Meow",2012-05-23,"does anyone think jon show is badly out of character in regards to how he is in the books even without the addition of the incompetence see i dont really think getting knocked out by craster or even chasing after ygritte are essentially untrue to jon snows character in the novels but i think lots of other changes arein episode six regardless of the farce of the chase storyline jon show is i think less self aware and sympathetic before ygritte gives him the slip than he is in the novels just before he lets her go its not just that he loses control of the situation although he does its the way he talks to her while hes trying to muster the resolution to execute her now most of the dialogue in the show in that scene does follow a clash of kings closely with the exception of one really crucial line which had it been included would have changed the whole scenein the book jon snow does indeed say im as much a crow as they are and someone might see the smoke but he also asks ygritte arent you afraid jon show delivers the first two lines in a tone that sounds like he is trying to be a hard man he is not showing sympathy with ygritte and he doesnt want to let his guard down i wouldnt exactly say his delivery was aggressive but there was no kindness there had the third line been included i think it would have been hard to play the scene that way you dont ask arent you afraid in the tone jon show was usingpersonally the way i read the scene in the novels was that jon snow was sad and regretful when he said all three lines and wasnt afraid of letting his feelings show but even if that is open to interpretation the third line makes it hard to believe jon snows tone didnt soften at some point he was quite willing to admit his weakness to ygritte even while he was debating whether to kill her i dont know whether the change between the book and the show emasculates jon show in the way other changes do but it does make him seem rather less thoughtful and kind than he was portrayed in the novels jon show lacks depth and given the line in question is one of the few omitted from the scene it looks like the change was pretty calculatedas to what happens after if ygritte had got away without this being the result of jon show changing his mind midstrike the chase wouldnt have been so out of character jon snow is pretty green  its just he never comes across like the utter fool jon show did jon show never really makes up his mind about what he wants to do its not even clear in the show he had decided to spare ygritte at that point he just couldnt kill her then the way the scene played out gutted a noble decision completely and made jons decision the product of mercy in the novels seem like weakness and stupidity the additional scenes between jon and ygritte although not in the novels do capture something of the dynamic between the two in the first half of a storm of swords which i dont remember very well but does anyone else think jon show has a bit too much sexual angst in these scenes compared to the books jon snow was broody about a lot of things but i didnt get the impression his enforced celibacy was really one of them i had the impression he was more clueless and embarrassed when faced with ygrittes persistence and i certainly dont remember him ever shouting at her or losing his cool in the way jon show did maybe im wrong about this but i cant imagine book jon getting in a huff over mention of stones and bones he was mighty offended when tormund suggested he was a eunuch but that was itbut the really stupid part of those scenes and they were stupid all the way through was jon shows reaction to ygrittes offer of a life away from the wall in the wilds she says something about having a cabin and women of his own etc choosing what time to get out of bed and so on kit very convincingly shows how this offer hits home with jon show his eyes wander everywhere looking mournful and confused his voice is totally hoarse he has to stop the conversation and ask her to move the trouble is this reaction makes no sense at all there is no indication in the books that jon snow would be even remotely tempted at this stage by the offer of a wildling life for a start he knows very little about it but for an offer like that to have resonance it has to already mean something to the person in question moreover although jons life did sort of suck i never got the impression he was ever that unhappy with it to consider upping ship and deserting but if that is not the case why did he react that way to ygrittes offerin the novels jon and ygrittes first meeting was all about culture shock his knowing nothing was about his ignorance of or sometimes his inability to accept wildling culture by having ygritte really get to jon in the way she did made him look thoroughly gullible and uncomfortable in his own skin in a way he was not in the novels it was as though all his beliefs were collapsing the very first time they were exposed to serious questioning and he even got confused when he had to defend the role of the nights watch it is true that throughout his sojourn with the wildlings in the novels he did have many of his cherished notions questioned and he certainly learned a lot but these changes make jon show seem like some indecisive caricature of all the weal elements of jon snow with none of the strengths"

"dreamcatcher",2012-05-23,"you make a really good point ive never looked at it this way but youre right so theyve been weakening his character from the get go great im not against changes but what theyve done to jon is really pitiful i mean they took my favourite character from the books and made him a guy i would probably hate reading about dany is similar to showjon but thats just how she is written and its not just that they make him look stupid while doing dumb mistakes they also have all the other characters tell him how stupid he is and jon just stares and says nothing even my father who never read the books thinks that jon looks like an idiotmy favourite scene from jons storyline this season is the dialogue between him sam and gilly its straight out of the book and his character is the same its also kits strongest scene this season imo and i agree with the point that dd have their favourites i almost never hear them talk about jon or kit its always the kids peter richard and emilia i believe the biggest mistakes within his storyline are somewhat reparable but i dont have high hopes at this pointi think kit is a good actor he got the leading role in war horse right after drama school for gods sake but the problem is that hes doing what he can with the material that he has i also think that the gillysamjon exchange was his strongest scene we know kit read the novels so hes also as an actor probably torn between playing jon show and jon snow"

"victim",2012-05-23,"this character arc seems more about jon discovering his duty to the nights watch than anything else jon has no love for the wall in my opinion he definitely thought it would be different and there would be more good men there like benjen and jeor rather than rapists and thieves he saw it as his only option as the bastard of winterfell who wanted to make his own claim on society he remembers being a child with robb and saying that he wanted to be the lord of winterfell even though he knew he couldnt he still had big aspirations and the wall was the best place for a bastard to make a name for themselves i think the question is why does anyone like jon as a character hes a spoilt brat who thinks he deserves more than he does because of who his father is i think a lot of his story in the show so far has revolved around learning how to become a brother of the nights watch and this is very much the way his character arc in season 2 has played out in many ways jon ends up givingup himself to be a blackcloak on the wall evident in his betrayal to ygritte at the queenscrown because he is more loyal to the watch than he is to the girl he loves season 2 has to be all about how he gets to this point right now hes making an absolute mess of things i cant argue that and everyone around him seems to have his better mormonts line of learn how to follow seems to be quite important to his story arc jon is still at this point struggling with the fact that he is in no way a leader and that people can easily push him around most importantly jons learning that hes clearly not as big as he thinks he is in the episode summary for valar morghulis jon proves himself to qhorin as readers it seems pretty obvious what this is going to be the thing is that this will be the first time jon has followed the orders of a leader around him as in perhaps he has finally discovered his duty its hard to argue because episode 10 is still a week and a half away but im assuming jon and qhorin will have one more dialogue interchange where qhorin tells him what to do jon says he wont do it and qhorin reminds him of his duty before they ultimately fight and jon goes off with his wildling band next season should really iterate just how unimportant he is up until the point where he does  arguably  the most important thing any member of the nights watch has done in a century as in he risks his life to get back to the wall before the wildlings and informs them all of their oncoming war saving the watch in the process he does this because he finally understands his duty as a brother the boy at the beginning of agot would be thrilled to be elected lord commander it is known but jon isnt because he knows that either way his duty is to the wall no matter what his position is"

"Keep Shelly in Athens",2012-05-24,"patchface  there is no ygritte character development or arc all you need is that one beheading scene to know that shes feisty and brave like osha with red hair shes static all the way through only there to develop jons character like most women in fiction facepalm i think thus far we can say that he botches his first real test in the wild and he gets shamed for idealizing celibacy so in both developments jon is not looking too bright as far as the kitacting question goes i think his best acting was at crasters and those scenes were snoozeworthy i havent seen him in anything else so i have nothing to compare maybe in other work he actually uses his facial muscles and he doesnt look miserable all the time then we know its not just him and that benioff and weiss are taking ygrittes catch phrase too literally edited by keep shelly in athens 24 may 2012  1052 am"
"Hear me Meow",2012-05-24,"this character arc seems more about jon discovering his duty to the nights watch than anything else jon has no love for the wall in my opinion he definitely thought it would be different and there would be more good men there like benjen and jeor rather than rapists and thieves he saw it as his only option as the bastard of winterfell who wanted to make his own claim on society he remembers being a child with robb and saying that he wanted to be the lord of winterfell even though he knew he couldnt he still had big aspirations and the wall was the best place for a bastard to make a name for themselves i think the question is why does anyone like jon as a character hes a spoilt brat who thinks he deserves more than he does because of who his father is i think a lot of his story in the show so far has revolved around learning how to become a brother of the nights watch and this is very much the way his character arc in season 2 has played out in many ways jon ends up givingup himself to be a blackcloak on the wall evident in his betrayal to ygritte at the queenscrown because he is more loyal to the watch than he is to the girl he loves season 2 has to be all about how he gets to this point right now hes making an absolute mess of things i cant argue that and everyone around him seems to have his better mormonts line of learn how to follow seems to be quite important to his story arc jon is still at this point struggling with the fact that he is in no way a leader and that people can easily push him around most importantly jons learning that hes clearly not as big as he thinks he is in the episode summary for valar morghulis jon proves himself to qhorin as readers it seems pretty obvious what this is going to be the thing is that this will be the first time jon has followed the orders of a leader around him as in perhaps he has finally discovered his duty its hard to argue because episode 10 is still a week and a half away but im assuming jon and qhorin will have one more dialogue interchange where qhorin tells him what to do jon says he wont do it and qhorin reminds him of his duty before they ultimately fight and jon goes off with his wildling band next season should really iterate just how unimportant he is up until the point where he does  arguably  the most important thing any member of the nights watch has done in a century as in he risks his life to get back to the wall before the wildlings and informs them all of their oncoming war saving the watch in the process he does this because he finally understands his duty as a brother the boy at the beginning of agot would be thrilled to be elected lord commander it is known but jon isnt because he knows that either way his duty is to the wall no matter what his position isi think you are correct as to how jons character arc will play out in the show i know its probably been said before but it seems like they think deviating substantially from the path of jons development in the books will make for better tv his choices will seem more dramatic and more pronounced and hell have more of an underdog appeal the downside is as the op says that jon show is an emasculated version of the book character hes more bratty and spoilt than jon snow was even at the start of gotit does seem to me though that they will have to change the whole tone of jons sojourn with the wildlings for the show in the books hes a developing young man when he goes over he has resigned himself to the life of the nights watch and he handled himself well on his first ranging the way i read cok was that jon matured substantially throughout the book and became very stoic and serious in his dedication to the nights watch esp because of qhorin but before that too the stuff in storm tested that but it sure didnt create itin the show on the other hand hes just a train wreck and it seems to me that ygritte or someone will have to build him up again he is going to have to have a colossal amount of character development in particular rapid gains in maturity telescoped into his time with the wildlings thats just not how it worked in the booksalso i cant for the life of me see why ygritte will ever be attracted to him in this state even when he does kill qhorin fools who get all their comrades killed through indecision and confusion dont seem like ygrittes cup of tea at least jon show is pretty edited by procopius 24 may 2012  1106 am"
"Sanette",2012-05-24,"keep shelly in athens yeah ygritte is just a literary device but since they felt the need to develop talisajeyne they probably wanted to do the same with ygritte and her culture except the fact that they made jon look like a fool while doing it and ygritte was never this arrogant and mean in the book yes she teased jon and made fun of his ignorance but she never mocked him for being a virgin especially when we know his reasons for ityes those scenes were his best and he looked perceptive and quite clever in them both jon and kit until craster beat the shit out of him the way he looked around crasters keep and saw the women the scene with gilly thats exactly how jon would react id be willing to overlook craster making fun of his face and the lord commander chiding him if they continued his storyline in this vein but they made it much worse anyway i only saw some clips from war horse and he was great in them its theatre so he must use his facial muscles a lot keep in mind that he played a 14year old boy in it edited by sanette 24 may 2012  1137 am"

"Hear me Meow",2012-05-24,"i guess this is a bit subjective i first watched season one before reading the books and tv jon guess also kh is the reason jon became my favourite character then in the books i liked him even more my perceptions of bookjon and tvjon were very mixedup just until i started watching season two and then i realised something was wrong with my favourite so in mind i have already built up the image of jon snow looking like kh because i read the books after the show it would have been really hard to build up a complete different character image in my mind based only on the books it is interesting though how the nonbook readers perceive jons character i asked one nonbook reader if he also thought jon seemed stupid in the second season he told me no but olny because he didnt seem very bright in the first season eitherinteresting i think it is quite telling that nonreaders arent screaming blue murder over jons behavior this season kits jon is the only major character in the series who captures nothing of my image of his book character sure a lot of the others have been badly out of character in book terms almost from the start im looking at you cat but i do feel some of their scenes even now still get somewhere near the essence of the people they are in the books kits jon though i totally disliked from the start he just came across as a dopey wimp this is fine though i love how close alfie and emilia are to their book characters so i cant reasonably expect more from an adaptation jennys dolfens fan art perfectly captures my image of jon snow"
"Sanette",2012-05-24,"no that would be bran followed by aryayoure right i got it mixed up varamyr said that jon was more powerful than him and not the rest of the starks still bran is so powerful that i take him for more of a greenseer than a warg i know that hes both though and we dont know if arya is better at warging than jon since she isnt in westeros fell free to correct me if im wrong"
"Lady of Long Lake",2012-05-24,"no that would be bran followed by aryabran is the only one of the 6 children that have received guidance about his ability too i think brans warging ability was hastened by his desperation to be able to move via hodor im guessing that the other 4 kids could be equally as strong if someone counseled them"

"Ghost714",2012-05-26,"as ive said before in other threads i feel this is the most important reason for the changes of the last few episodes there is no way to show why jon resists ygrittes avances if she makes them after he has seemingly joined the wildlings at that point he cant say i took an oath of celibacy as the explanation that would give away to the wildlings that he still considers himself a crow in the books we know this because we are inside his head but in the show if they cant let him say it the reason for resisting ygritte is open to interpretation it could also be because he just isnt into her or because hes a virgin and afraid to look terribly inexperienced to this wildling woman who obviously knows very well what goes where or any other explanation people could come up with with the scenes with ygritte they have established that he is tempted but doesnt want to break his vow if he keeps resisting her avances for a while after he joins them that shows us he hasnt forgotten that vow yet without him having to say itso i think moving up some of the ygritte relationship to before he turned his cloak was necessary i do wish they had done the rewriting differently though because i feel they way they did it some things just dont make much sense starting with how qhorin and the others just leave jon to killing ygritte even if they wanted to give him some privacy to do it why would they move so far away that jon could get lostan example how it could have been done better instead of letting ygritte go jon takes her back to qhorin and the others opportunity for the test explanation of qhorin qhorin sends jon to take ygritte back to the fist for questioning opportunity for the needed precloakturn sexual harrassment scenes qhorin and the others run into rattleshirt and his men the rangers sacrifice themselves onebyone to let qhorin catch up with jon with rattleshirt hot on their tail the rest follows as in the books just with ygritte as their prisoner at the time rattleshirt catches themgood point i never read jon as this totally badass infallible guy people apparently want him to be in the show certainly not at this point i dont think the most important aspect of his development was manning up or becoming a great leader to me the most important thing was the development from always do what has to be done like ned taught him obeying rules and customs to do what is right from a more humanist point of view lord commander jon does things not because the rules and customs say they should be done if he feels the right thing to do is not what the rules say that should be done he changes the rules that is why he opens the gates to the wildlings even though the nights watch is supposed to keep them out of the seven kingdoms he feels it is not right to let thousands of people be killed by the others just because they were born on the wrong side of the wall its this change that by the end of adwd is his downfall hes changed too many rules for the men that followed him to acceptthis important aspect of jon is still intact so while i didnt like all the changes and would have preferred a solution that didnt make jon and qhorin look less competent than they were in the books i also dont think they really are problematic for jons further developmenti think that is not a fair judgement the first book has nowhere near the complexity as the second it serves as an introduction to the main characters but theres not really huge character development yet and the number of different storylines and locations is also significantly less its just easier source material to stick to the second book is where things start to happen more inside the characters heads than through actions which is much more difficult to translate to the screen and the huge diverging of the storylines makes it very difficult too they need to change things to make this interesting tv if they stuck to all the contemplation and thoughts we get in the books the average tvaudience would get bored andor terribly confused all in all the fact that we are all still watching and still care about what they do proves to me that they are not doing a bad jobthere is a way to show jon resisting ygritte after he joins the wildlings without him saying i swore a vow in the book jon said he didnt want to screw ygritte because he would not father a bastard and that he was to young to wed thats the reasoning he gave tormond for not having sex with ygritte so the show could have done domething like that its not like there only option was to show jon refusing ygritte before turning his cloakand i understand the second book is more complicated than the first book i get that they need to combine some storylines and condense others however that does not explain some of the very poor choices they have made with their changes this season there is no reason to show jon being a blundering idiot in every single episode he is in especially when some of those blunders conflict with the character development they showed him having in season one they should be able to figure out how to do changes withough changing entire character motivations and we should not be able to tell who the writers personally like best and who they dont care about as far as characters go then there are some very minor things that they have changed for no reason at all but to be different from the books in the book 4 men go with qhorin including jon and thats ebben stonesnake and squire dalbridge in the show the same amount of men go with qhorin except they give two of the guys made up names instead of making them ebben and squire dalbridge i know thats not a huge thing but why change those two names to something made up if not just for the sake of being different in the show tywin freaks out on amory lorch for sending a raven to a northern house i have no problem with thisor any of the tywin changes for the most part however the house tywin names is a made up northern house what is the point of that there are like fifty known northern houses in the books and they could have used any one of them so why have amory send a raven to a made up house it just makes no sense there is no reasoning for it other than just being different so why those things are not huge there is still no reason to change them the show is already going to have to change so much and they do so thats why people get mad with the little things when there is no point in changing them the show has completely whitewashed tyrion they have made people sympathies with cersei way more than in the books and they have made joffrey way worse than he is there is no need for such extreme changes they dont need to completely remake all these major characters for example the changes they made with margaery tyrells character combining her character with olenna tyrells that was done very well it makes sense to combine characters like that for the show the unfortunate thing is though not all the changes have been as successful as the changes with margaery the show is making to many characters black and white instead of leaving them as shades of grey the books are full of grey characters and thats what makes them so good yet the show is changing that for some reason and its not because tv audiences dont like those kinds of characters hbo has had a lot of shows with morally grey characters very succesful shows i might add so thats why it seems like the writers are changing things just because they can and thats why it seems like they think they are better than the source material i really hope this post makes sense i wrote it after just waking up with only like an hour of sleep because my 8 week old boxer puppy doesnt think i should be

"Fengari",2012-05-26,"there is a way to show jon resisting ygritte after he joins the wildlings without him saying i swore a vow in the book jon said he didnt want to screw ygritte because he would not father a bastard and that he was to young to wed thats the reasoning he gave tormond for not having sex with ygritte so the show could have done domething like that its not like there only option was to show jon refusing ygritte before turning his cloakthat is the explanation he gives tormond yes and i believe there is truth to it too but it isnt the main reason the main reason is being true to his vows is so important to him and they cant have him say that after he joined the wildlings its only later that he realises the celibacy thing isnt that important whats important about joining the nights watch is defending the realm and as long as he does that hes not betraying the nw even if he is breaking their rules that is the development im talking about from being the guy who follows the rules he becomes the guy who does things because he feels they are the right thing to doand i understand the second book is more complicated than the first book i get that they need to combine some storylines and condense others however that does not explain some of the very poor choices they have made with their changes this season there is no reason to show jon being a blundering idiot in every single episode he is in especially when some of those blunders conflict with the character development they showed him having in season onei already said that i would have preferred them to make the change in a different way making him look less blundering im not sure the blunders conflict with the development from season one though in season one we saw that hes a good swordfighter we saw that even though he thought he was better as them at first lord snow he developed a good relationship with the common men of the nights watch grenn and pip we saw that he stood up to protect the weaker elements sam and we saw that he ultimately decides to stick to his vows even though he wants to do something different although it took his friends to convince him on that one i havent seen blunders that conflict with thatthey should be able to figure out how to do changes withouth changing entire character motivations and we should not be able to tell who the writers personally like best and who they dont care about as far as characters goas explained i dont think they have changed jons entire character motivation it would have been more of a change to his motivation if they had disregarded jon saying no to ygritte because of his vowthen there are some very minor things that they have changed for no reason at all but to be different from the books in the book 4 men go with qhorin including jon and thats ebben stonesnake and squire dalbridge in the show the same amount of men go with qhorin except they give two of the guys made up names instead of making them ebben and

being different so why those things are not huge there is still no reason to change them the show is already going to have to change so much and they do so thats why people get mad with the little things when there is no point in changing themi agree with you on that point those minor changes dont really have a point to them but as they are minor changes i dont really have a problem with them either maybe its because i have only read the books twice and these details were already lost to me anywaythe show has completely whitewashed tyrion they have made people sympathies with cersei way more than in the books and they have made joffrey way worse than he is there is no need for such extreme changes they dont need to completely remake all these major charactersi dont know if you read the forum on twop especially the completely unspoilt thread it seems to me those characters are received pretty much as i read them first time around i think our view of the characters is influenced a lot by what happens later in the books and whats great about grrms writing is that when we reread we see that the elements that become clear later on in the books are already present earlierfor example the changes they made with margaery tyrells character combining her character with olenna tyrells that was done very well it makes sense to combine characters like that for the show the unfortunate thing is though not all the changes have been as successful as the changes with margaery the show is making to many characters black and white instead of leaving them as shades of grey the

of shows with morally grey characters very succesful shows i might add so thats why it seems like the writers are changing things just because they can and thats why it seems like they think they are better than the source materialim afraid that is the result of the time restraints like i said grrm is very good at including details that make the characters greyer that become more obvious as time passes but the show simply does not have the time to be this nuancedi really hope this post makes sense i wrote it after just waking up with only like an hour of sleep because my 8 week old boxer

"Hear me Meow",2012-05-26,"as ive said before in other threads i feel this is the most important reason for the changes of the last few episodes there is no way to show why jon resists ygrittes avances if she makes them after he has seemingly joined the wildlings at that point he cant say i took an oath of celibacy as the explanation that would give away to the wildlings that he still considers himself a crow in the books we know this because we are inside his head but in the show if they cant let him say it the reason for resisting ygritte is open to interpretation it could also be because he just isnt into her or because hes a virgin and afraid to look terribly inexperienced to this wildling woman who obviously knows very well what goes where or any other explanation people could come up with with the scenes with ygritte they have established that he is tempted but doesnt want to break his vow if he keeps resisting her avances for a while after he joins them that shows us he hasnt forgotten that vow yet without him having to say itso i think moving up some of the ygritte relationship to before he turned his cloak was necessary i do wish they had done the rewriting differently though because i feel they way they did it some things just dont make much sense starting with how qhorin and the others just leave jon to killing ygritte even if they wanted to give him some privacy to do it why would they move so far away that jon could get lostan example how it could have been done better instead of letting ygritte go jon takes her back to qhorin and the others opportunity for the test explanation of qhorin qhorin sends jon to take ygritte back to the fist for questioning opportunity for the needed precloakturn sexual harrassment scenes qhorin and the others run into rattleshirt and his men the rangers sacrifice themselves onebyone to let qhorin catch up with jon with rattleshirt hot on their tail the rest follows as in the books just with ygritte as their prisoner at the time rattleshirt catches themgood point i never read jon as this totally badass infallible guy people apparently want him to be in the show certainly not at this point i dont think the most important aspect of his development was manning up or becoming a great leader to me the most important thing was the development from always do what has to be done like ned taught him obeying rules and customs to do what is right from a more humanist point of view lord commander jon does things not because the rules and customs say they should be done if he feels the right thing to do is not what the rules say that should be done he changes the rules that is why he opens the gates to the wildlings even though the nights watch is supposed to keep them out of the seven kingdoms he feels it is not right to let thousands of people be killed by the others just because they were born on the wrong side of the wall its this change that by the end of adwd is his downfall hes changed too many rules for the men that followed him to acceptthis important aspect of jon is still intact so while i didnt like all the changes and would have preferred a solution that didnt make jon and qhorin look less competent than they were in the books i also dont think they really are problematic for jons further developmenti think that is not a fair judgement the first book has nowhere near the complexity as the second it serves as an introduction to the main characters but theres not really huge character development yet and the number of different storylines and locations is also significantly less its just easier source material to stick to the second book is where things start to happen more inside the characters heads than through actions which is much more difficult to translate to the screen and the huge diverging of the storylines makes it very difficult too they need to change things to make this interesting tv if they stuck to all the contemplation and thoughts we get in the books the average tvaudience would get bored andor terribly confused all in all the fact that we are all still watching and still care about what they do proves to me that they are not doing a bad jobinteresting posti certainly dont think anyone would say jon was infallible he didnt make any of the mistakes jon show does but that doesnt mean he has super powers or anything he was badass in the books compared to jon show though although this isnt saying muchi didnt think jons arc in cok was about becoming a leader no it was about growing up and resigning himself to being a man of the nights watch and learning about his duty interestingly the leadership bit is what hbo is playing up if you think about mormonts comment to jon at crasters and benioffs idea that jon show thinks asking to go with qhorin is a fast track to leadershipi guess i dont agree with your idea of an opposition between a code jon learned from ned and a more humane ethos he later develops jon has always been a humane person i think and he learned this from nedeven if you are right about this being central to jons development though why have d  d botched the scene that really revealed jon being humane namely his sparing of ygritte they changed it from the books so jons honourable decision is laced with indecision and weakness it is not even clear when jon decides to spare ygritte he just chickens out of doing the deed then and therelastly jons incompetence married to his reluctance to kill a girl the only reason the show gave for his behaviour with ygritte has gotten all his comrades killed this ought to be an immensely powerful formative experience which should change jon substantially from the book version so it is hard to say they are really on the right tracks with his character

"Le Cygne",2012-05-26,"they miss so many chances to tie the second season to the first season the season that was so effective because it followed the book more closely most people remember the scene when ned cut off the head of the boy from the nights watch who ran from the white walkers back then jon didnt question ned he was his hero but here jon is in a nearly identical situation about to swing the blade and he makes a very different decision he spares ygritte thats character growth thats continuity thats even downright poetic the bastard is seeing the shades of gray that ned for all his finer points couldnt see the show took all that away sure they get from point a to point b but along the way they leave something behind  the character"

"SerMixalot",2012-05-26,"fengari i will only respond that even if you accept the shows premise and storyline there were easy and appropiate changes that would not have impacted time or budget and would fit within the story arc they were creating if jon once defended himself to ygritte during the 2 episodes in other than lame ways if he responded just once to shut her up saying something like i will father no bastards that would have empowered jon given insight to his character and still created and strengthened the relationship to y"

forgotten that vow yet without him having to say iti agree that its going to be hard to show that jons still faithful to his oath in the book we can hear his inner thoughts but film has its own ways how to work around that for example while being with the wildlings jon can encounter a member of the nights watch and tell him that hes not a turncloak and then have the wildlings kill the guy also they can use the actors face to show the characters true feelings besides he said he doesnt want to have sex with her because he doesnt want to father a bastard that explains his hesitation to me and he didnt find her attractive at first but they cant use that since ygritte is played by rose and if i remember correctly none of the wildlings really believed that he broke his oathi didnt think jons arc in cok was about becoming a leader no it was about growing up and resigning himself to being a man of the nights watch and learning about his duty interestingly the leadership bit is what hbo is playing up if you think about mormonts comment to jon at crasters and benioffs idea that jon show thinks asking to go with qhorin is a fast track to leadershipjons motivation is still the same i think hes a lords son whos had to live his whole life under the shadow of his siblings he wants to prove everyone that hes just as good as them he couldnt do that while being locked at the wall so mormonts campaign presents a huge opportunity for him being asked by qhorin to join his scout party is a big honor for him and he doesnt want to disappoint him because hes this big famous ranger and he didnt he did everything right hes competent and levelheaded but thats exactly what the show turned on its head jon show is reckless doesnt think ahead and cant defend himself even if hes being insulted by his prisoner so his motivation is still there but the execution is completely wrong the writers might think that his main motivation is to become a leaderwhich i also dont really agree with but it isnt flat out wrong it just isnt something that plays a big part in acok he just wants to be a proper member of the nights watch and show that hes worth something the fact that sam now looks like a more competent man of the watch just proves my pointanother thing thats been bothering me is that jons scenes lack drama and by this i mean dialogues with some powerful writing and emotions the only one i find good is mormont telling him to learn how to follow and maybe his fight with ygritte about the north season 1 was much better in this regard we had his talk with eddard tyrion sam and aemon theres one episode left till the end of the season and weve had two fairly interesting scenes that tried to deepen jons character hes one of the main characters for gods sake but no theyd rather show ros getting schooled by lf or being tortured by joffreytrue the first season was much easier to translate to the screen the narrative is tighter the main characters were together for much of it and then restricted to a few locations with one outlierdaeny now everyone is by themselves and the narrative has widened in scope tremendously predictably they lost control and a lot of season two has suffered they either wernt up to the task or they underestimated it admiring their own work in season one hopefully after they see what a wreck theyve created they put serious effort into fixing these problems for season 3 again translating book2 was an exponentially tougher job nailing it would have been a tremendous accomplishment but they did not nail itthey do need to make changes and probably bigger ones than theyve been making they need to focus on arcs or cut them entirely the cliffnotes plotlines weve been getting are weakthisi think they extremely underestimated the complexity of the second book but if you cant do it right then dont do it at all it seems to me like they didnt have enough time for the preproduction of season 2 the first season was a much longer process and it shows hire more writers good ones and make bryan cogman the third showrunner they need someone to tell them what theyre doing wrong and since dampd started this thing together and had success with it they cant see clearly anymore theyre downgrading a lot of the characters i dont know if they fear losing viewers or if they just cater to fans of certain characters this show is never going to be true blood but it is hbo its supposed to be complex and jarring this season is a clash of kings for dummies and thats a big shock for me after season 1 edited by sanette 26 may 2012  1246 pm"

"fassreiter",2012-05-27,"from the perspective of ygritte here she has found a man she finds physically attractive is safe to be around but equally capable of cutting anyone else who messes with her to ribbons if you think about it that way jon is pretty much her dream manyou dont get the concept of what a spearwife is at all do you in fact it is ygritte who stands up and protects jon on every single occasion in asos the term emasculation in this thread is telling enough ygritte is not into jon because he is a mindless brute who is able to defend what he manages to drag into his cave mance is not king of the wildlings because he could beat the magnar of thenn and some other leaders it is much more than that wildling society is the only society we have met that knows about gender equality a man who steals a woman is not simply required to be violent he must be smart and creative on top of that ygritte is not into jon because he can protect her she can protect herself she starts to like him because he is smart interested in her culture and their songs if he was a mindless brute she would just kill him in his sleep because that is what wildling women do in contrast to the kneeler women that are just sold by their families and have no way of helping themselves i liked that about the show they underlined that there is a society in which women can be strong i would have hated it if jon had just shut her up with some witty remark this is her territory she is a strong woman and she chose jon to be her partner not because she needs protection but because she is a free woman just like the free folk choose their own kings jon is lost in this kind of society and the show decided to underline that he will get used to it and then he will appear more confident again right now he has a lot to learn for example that being mocked by a woman doesnt equal emasculation ygritte outsmarted him and he will learn to do the same and she will like him even better for it why do you all think weakness in a certain situation is a sign of emasculation this would imply not being a man  being a woman would equal weakness right ygritte was in a weak position when she was captured and no one would think she was a weak person she was clever and turned the tables on jon so this initial weakness worked in her favour jon has to do the same why would that be emasculating you need to experience failures so you can overcome them but this is not even the point the point is that ygritte is not there to show that jon is a desirable guy her function in the story is to reveal the free folks perspective i think it was a good decision to lay the ground work for the concept of wildling society during the scenes with ygritte and to cut the scenes with the rangers being on the run from rattleshirt these scenes would only be useful to work on qhorin characterisation but why do we even need one we didnt spend as much time with him as in the books he will die soon so why waste scarce screen time with him i like qhorin in the books but for the show they decided not to focus on his character but on this function to the plot development in the following seasons it will be much more important that jon learns about wildling culture because the free folk are an important statement about feudal westeros and the game of thrones if jon is destined to be a king or a leader he needs to learn these things its much more important than being the invincible smart guy with the cool wolf this story is not about jon it is about the game of thrones it is a political story not a bildungsroman so maybe they are not very subtle with the handling of jons learning processes so what"
"Ghost714",2012-05-27,"you dont get the concept of what a spearwife is at all do you in fact it is ygritte who stands up and protects jon on every single occasion in asos the term emasculation in this thread is telling enough ygritte is not into jon because he is a mindless brute who is able to defend what he manages to drag into his cave mance is not king of the wildlings because he could beat the magnar of thenn and some other leaders it is much more than that wildling society is the only society we have met that knows about gender equality a man who steals a woman is not simply required to be violent he must be smart and creative on top of that ygritte is not into jon because he can protect her she can protect herself she starts to like him because he is smart interested in her culture and their songs if he was a mindless brute she would just kill him in his sleep because that is what wildling women do in contrast to the kneeler women that are just sold by their families and have no way of helping themselves i liked that about the show they underlined that there is a society in which women can be strong i would have hated it if jon had just shut her up with some witty remark this is her territory she is a strong woman and she chose jon to be her partner not because she needs protection but because she is a free woman just like the free folk choose their own kings jon is lost in this kind of society and the show decided to underline that he will get used to it and then he will appear more confident again right now he has a lot to learn for example that being mocked by a woman doesnt equal emasculation ygritte outsmarted him and he will learn to do the same and she will like him even better for it why do you all think weakness in a certain situation is a sign of emasculation this would imply not being a man  being a woman would equal weakness right ygritte was in a weak position when she was captured and no one would think she was a weak person she was clever and turned the tables on jon so this initial weakness worked in her favour jon has to do the same why would that be emasculating you need to experience failures so you can overcome them but this is not even the point the point is that ygritte is not there to show that jon is a desirable guy her function in the story is to reveal the free folks perspective i think it was a good decision to lay the ground work for the concept of wildling society during the scenes with ygritte and to cut the scenes with the rangers being on the run from rattleshirt these scenes would only be useful to work on qhorin characterisation but why do we even need one we didnt spend as much time with him as in the books he will die soon so why waste scarce screen time with him i like qhorin in the books but for the show they decided not to focus on his character but on this function to the plot development in the following seasons it will be much more important that jon learns about wildling culture because the free folk are an important statement about feudal westeros and the game of thrones if jon is destined to be a king or a leader he needs to learn these things its much more important than being the invincible smart guy with the cool wolf this story is not about jon it is about the game of thrones it is a political story not a bildungsroman so maybe they are not very subtle with the handling of jons learning processes so whatso ygritte likes jon because he is smart i can see that in the books because in the books jon is pretty smart even when out of his known element however how in the world could ygritte ever start to like jon in the show he is not smart at all on top of that they did not have ygritte tell the story of bael the bard so its not like ygritte was attracted to jon because he showed an interest in her culture right away so they didnt have jon kill orel they didnt show him taking an interest into her culture right away and they didnt show jon doing anything smart in fact they showed many examples of jon being stupid so what the hell is there to make ygritte want to be with jon nothing that i can think of and thats what i think people are having an issue with well that and many other thingstoday i actually reread all of jons chapters in acok from the moment he leaves the fist to go with qhorin into the skirling pass so i gotta say that i disagree with you about them showing jon and qhorin getting chased by rattleshirt that chase was not all about qhorin so i dont share the same opinion on hes going to die so why show it there are really a lot of golden moments during those jon chapters and i feel like the show could have had some amazing dialogue between jon and qhorin in those chapters you really feel a since of urgency that is completely nonexistent in the show when it comes to jons scenes those chapters are just so good imo you see these guys being willing to sacrifice themselves so that a few of them might make it back to the fist and they do it without a moments hesitation i think that would have been nice to see in the show instead of jon being responsible for the deaths of three of his brothers and the capture of the halfhand those jon chapters are so good and so frustrating because they literally did everything they could to get away from rattleshirt it just was not enough without showing the chase the death of qhorin isnt going to be impacting at all at least nothing like it was in the books especially because they not only didnt show the chase but they also didnt make qhorin as awesome as he was in the book in the book qhorin is this soft spoken giant of a man with a huge amount of wisdom and book qhorin is somebody who respects the wildlings a lot even as they are chasing them trying to kill them that kind of qhorin is way more interesting than the short loud qhorin on the show who calls the wildlings goat fuckers and tells jon that he is stupider than he looks for saying he understood something that qhorin in the book would actually believe in then show qhorin says its all just a bunch of words boy something to help us sleep at night and i think thats ridiculously out of character for qhorin qhorin really believed in dying for the realm and the nights watchi really can not get past how much they screwed up qhorin and all of jons story for that matter"
"Fengari",2012-05-27,"snipi guess i dont agree with your idea of an opposition between a code jon learned from ned and a more humane ethos he later develops jon has always been a humane person i think and he learned this from nedeven if you are right about this being central to jons development though why have d  d botched the scene that really revealed jon being humane namely his sparing of ygritte they changed it from the books so jons honourable decision is laced with indecision and weakness it is not even clear when jon decides to spare ygritte he just chickens out of doing the deed then and therelastly jons incompetence married to his reluctance to kill a girl the only reason the show gave for his behaviour with ygritte has gotten all his comrades killed this ought to be an immensely powerful formative experience which should change jon substantially from the book version so it is hard to say they are really on the right tracks with his characteri guess it boils down to how grrms characters are so complex different people relate to different aspects of them although i think bringing a part of his relationship with ygritte forward in the story was needed i already said i wished they would have done it differently without everything being the result of mistakes made by jon so i agree with you on that the point is that for me that isnt crucial to jons character development it does change things but it doesnt ruin everything i understand that if you valued different aspects of the character that may be more problematic to you and i admit that that means the show has done a poor job of portraying the full complexity of the character it just didnt feel that bad to me because the character as they chose to portray it still is in line with my personal view of it to say all this in one sentence i concede smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  jon being responsible for the three rangers being killed is indeed huge theres quite a few different ways this can influence jon and we have yet to see where theyll take that lets hope they will use it to turn him around as in hell realise he really needs to think things through moresnip also in the show when ygritte is talking to jon as he is about to take her head off she was more angry than in the book especially when she said strike hard and true crow or ill come back and haunt you i always thought that line was more playful in the book and thats part of what made it so hard for jon because ygritte was being so light hearted and casual in the book jon asked ygritte if she was afraid and she said i was last night but now the sun has come up so i dont know i just thought they made her to angry at that part in the show i mean ygritte can be fierce but she also jokes a lot and thats what i liked about her in the books even when she was about to be a head shorter she was still jokingi never read the lines you quoted as jokes i always saw them as references to the ww strike kard and true crow or ill come back and haunt you if he doesnt do the job thoroughly she may become a wight i was last night but now the sun has come up the really terrifying things happen at night in comparison getting a clean beheading is not so terrifying which doesnt mean it is not scary which is why she said she cant be brave forever"

"SerMixalot",2012-05-27,"wrt to jons feelings about turning his cloak it is another example grrm has placed in the story about conflicting duties he has a duty to his vows to the nw and he has a duty to follow qhs orders the interesting part is how he thinks and reacts to this conflict he tries to find a middle ground going over to the wildings becoming a wilding while never losing his core belief that he remains a nw and we see how different people react to it some believe him and htat he remained honorable while others dont it is interesting to contemplate how other characters would have reacted in that scenario ie jamiened brienne"

"Nine of Spades",2012-05-27,"you dont get the concept of what a spearwife is at all do you in fact it is ygritte who stands up and protects jon on every single occasion in asosshe sticks up for him within the society she doesnt physically protect him or seem to worry about him when rattleshirt is threatening him on the fist of the first men she seems content enough to let jon and ghost kill him though she does point out that ghost is there shes quick to point out hes the one who killed the halfhand and orell thats not to say that shes a shrinking violet and wont stick up for herself but shes still a wildling i dont think she would protect him if she didnt think he was worth the time or would never be able to stick up for himself or her show jon doesnt give ygritte any reason to think hes worth the timethe term emasculation in this thread is telling enough ygritte is not into jon because he is a mindless brute who is able to defend what he manages to drag into his cave mance is not king of the wildlings because he could beat the magnar of thenn and some other leaders it is much more than that wildling society is the only society we have met that knows about gender equality a man who steals a woman is not simply required to be violent he must be smart and creative on top of that ygritte is not into jon because he can protect her she can protect herselfi think the how of it is far less important then that you succeed its sort of a test of manhood one you have to pass to get the girlas for mance being kng of the wildlings isnt about conquest hes a coalition builder hes only a leader in as much as hes convinced the other leaders that they should listen to him and that coalition is very fragile that pretty much dissolves as soon as hes capturedi think you are misapplying modern notions here wildling society has gender equality in the sense that it comes darn close to everyone for themselves a woman has to fight for her life just like everyone else and if shes good at it they dont hold it against you you either strong or you are nothing when ygritte tells jon about her first time she mentions that the boy tried to steal her later and longspear rick broke his arm and called the boy weak all wildling women are going to want the strongest men they can find even if they can protect themselves because having 2 strong people in a marraige is going to be safer then oneshe starts to like him because he is smart interested in her culture and their songs if he was a mindless brute she would just kill him in his sleep because that is what wildling women do in contrast to the kneeler women that are just sold by their families and have no way of helping themselves i liked that about the show they underlined that there is a society in which women can be strong i would have hated it if jon had just shut her up with some witty remark this is her territory she is a strong woman and she chose jon to be her partner not because she needs protection but because she is a free woman just like the free folk choose their own kings jon is lost in this kind of society and the show decided to underline that he will get used to it and then he will appear more confident again right now he has a lot to learn for example that being mocked by a woman doesnt equal emasculation ygritte outsmarted him and he will learn to do the same and she will like him even better for it why do you all think weakness in a certain situation is a sign of emasculation this would imply not being a man  being a woman would equal weakness right ygritte was in a weak position when she was captured and no one would think she was a weak person she was clever and turned the tables on jon so this initial weakness worked in her favour jon has to do the same why would that be emasculating you need to experience failures so you can overcome them but this is not even the point the point is that ygritte is not there to show that jon is a desirable guy her function in the story is to reveal the free folks perspectiveit changes the nature of their first encounter profoundly instead of jon showing strength he shows weakness so her first impression of him is going to be this guy couldnt even hold me prisoner properly  what a moron the subsequent belittling especially the nature of it is also i think telling it might be possible to salvage jon in her eyes if qhorin and jon escape in a clever way but even then they are just going to be hunted down again and jon will yield but the fact the escape will surely fail diminishes the importance of it but still he doesnt even properly steal her in the show her people recover her easily enough in the book she isnt set free until jon lets her go as far as shes concerned hes free and clear at that point but the show he doesnt really have her free and clear and ultimately jon doesnt escapeas for ygritte being weak she didnt try and turn her cloak did she part of the reason that shes tough is because of how she stands up to the notion of being executed she also shows her toughness and cleverness in how she maneuvers jon through wildling society jon is invariably going to look weaker in the first half of asos because he does need ygrittes help quite a bit but the story can get away with it because jon is already pretty well established both in the story so what happens at the end of the book is believable for the characterand no her function is not just to tell jon of the wilding customs its also to make him fall in love with her to put the tension between love and freedom vs duty and quite possibly death shes a temptation for joni think it was a good decision to lay the ground work for the concept of wildling society during the scenes with ygritte and to cut the scenes with the rangers being on the run from rattleshirt these scenes would only be useful to work on qhorin characterisation but why do we even need one we didnt spend as much time with him as in the books he will die soon so why waste scarce screen time with him i like qhorin in the books but for the show they decided not to focus on his character but on this function to the plot development in the following seasons it will be much more important that jon learns about wildling culture because the free folk are an important statement about feudal westeros and the game of thrones if jon is destined to be a king or a leader he needs to learn these things its much more important than being the invincible smart guy with the cool wolf this story is not about jon it is about the game of thrones it is a political story not a bildungsroman so maybe they are not very subtle with the handling of jons learning processes so whatthose scenes running would if done properly been good tv it also would have been more faithful to the characters in the book edited by nine of spades 27 may 2012  1229 pm"

"Nine of Spades",2012-05-28,"yeah i dont get the whole jon is making dumb mistakes as lc hes pretty much on rotten ice from the start he has a faction within the watch almost at open revolt he has to try to please stannis while at the same time try to appear neutral hes got a bunch of wildlings north of the wall that he desperately wants to get behind the wall but he has to have some kind of control over them hes got no money no supplies and he needs to not only feed his men but find a way to feed the wildling hes also trying to check mel and her lord of light forced conversions and general people burning in the end he pushes to hard and too fast for some members of the watch and doesnt see their rebellionassassination attempt cominghe also throws in fully with stannis but i dont think thats a bad call at this point i think there is no way ramsay lets him get away with what he wants to do with the wildlings if he can survive the assassination attempt ill assume he does and he or stannis can defeat the boltons he wil have pulled off a pretty remarkable turnaround he will have gotten a large number of additional wildlings south with the means to control them secured a large amount of funding both as forfeit from the wildlings and the bank of braavos and he will have a relatively stable political situation in the north"
"Hodor Hodor!",2012-05-28,"completely agree with the sentiments expressed in this thread jons story or lack of has been the most disappointing aspect of this this season so far  imo i have no problem with plot changes but when the writers alter the very nature of the character it irks me jon is certainly a little ungainly at times but he isnt a complete moron i thought the book played out perfectly with jonygrette and would have adapted to the screen beautifully sure we are ending up in the same place but its at jons expense as others have noted who would vote this bumbling fool to be lord commander also where are the direwolves such an important part of the series particularly in later seasons but i havent sighted one for what seems an eternity maybe they were all in use for the filming of the grey and will be back later on"

"Jon Mark Selmy",2012-06-26,"the first season is pretty succesful so they get it in their heads that its because of them and then they think they can make any change they want when in reality the first season did so well because they actually stuck to the source materialfor the most partexactly ive been trying to say that many times in many threads"
"AdXRoss",2013-03-17,"im coming in well late here having only just watched season 2 having to wait for its uk dvd release and such grrr but im glad im not the only one whos noticed what a mess theyve made of jons character it was like this in season 1 where he doesnt get to save sam and prove his leadership competencies at castle black instead getting berated by thorne whom in the books is never indicated to have been a ranger or a particularly incisive character and now in season 2 not only is he robbed of many of his victories and triumphs  hes being turned into a professional cockup merchant rereading acok this week in the wake of finishing the season 2 dvd i cant help but notice how big the contrast is between book and show jon book jon is a bit petulant to start with but his character builds piece by piece until it absolutely makes sense that his later rise occur his book actions in the skirling pass are those of an honourable and strong man a young and inexperienced yet quite talented ranger someone who has the potential to be a leading light in the nights watch whereas the show version just bumbles from one cockup to the next the same sort of thing is being done to dany who instead of being a shrewd and diplomatic if sometimes naive and often quite targaryen young ruler is being turned into a shrill harpy who makes you wonder why one of her bloodriders hasnt strangled her in the night"
"The Boar of Gore",2013-05-08,"well at least kit harrington is doing a convincing job of being a good fighter hes embraced the physicality of his role"
"scurvy",2012-05-22,"my favorite chapter in cok and perhaps the whole series is the catelyn chapter in which she learns of the boys death and discusses it with brienne it is heartwrenching it provides complete and unrefutable reasoning for releasing the kingslayer she then parlays with him and makes him swear an oath to return the girls yet in the show the boys are only captives robb even says theres no risk to them having only three children instead of 5 with two captives and no male heir to her son the king is a lot different than having all five children with 4 captive theyve gutted her motivation and the parlay with jaime while good did not have him swear an oath im sure it will be aluded to later but they really made her a weak woman terrible terrible a grieving mother is someone everyone can empathize with a worried mother not as much they could have at least had her stitting with a parchment telling robb that the boys were dead and thats why she released them but theon poisoned the ravens and nobody even knows of his mummers farce and robbs motivation for having sex with jeyne is weakened bc hes neither injured nor grieving very disappointed with this reinvention"
"Harrad",2012-05-24,"i refute it"
"Onion Smuggler",2012-05-24,"i agree with the weakness of her motivations my brother a nonreader was asking why on earth she let the kingslayer go i tried to argue that she was worried for her daughters but he still thought that her motivation was lacking"
"The Monkey",2012-05-24,"she was sure that jaime wouldve been killed during the night by the karstarks if he died he daughters would almost certainly have died too and since she had no chance of protecting him with just brienne she had no choice but to release him its certainly a good motivation possibly even more so than in the book however why she didnt use this argument when robb confronted her is beyond me"
"turdle",2012-05-24,"this whole season has been hbo just trying to touch on all or a bunch of the bullet points of acok without worrying about whether or not the shit they put inbetween actually makes them make sense or making sure that the intended implications of a scene from acok are what they are supposed to be i have nonreader friends who are sure that the shadow is going to show up during the finale the reason is because yes hbo showed both the assassination of renly and the birth of a shadow but the order that these appear is important in the book renlys death is the set up and the birth is the pay off the implication is that melisandre andor the lord of light are to be taken seriously on the tv show they made the birth the set up and renlys death the pay off and because this is the only shadow that exists it really makes the shadow itself the important thing yet were not going to see it or any other shadow now and that shadow is going to seem really bizarre and totally deus ex machina when nonreaders think back to it cats situation is no different yep they managed to cross that bullet point off the list is it as strong a moment as in the book no definitely not"
"Gingerly Grumkin",2012-05-24,"its fucking awful the way hbo butchers cat joff style robbs story is also fucked over by this what i really dont get is why did theon burn the kids in the first place if the iron born knows whats up and westeros is ignorant on everything then why kill 2 random kids to piss of the people of winterfell and only the people of winterfell"
"Buckwheat",2012-05-24,"scurvy i am out of likes but i like that you started this thread i agree that cats characterisation is off they made her look much weaker character i think she does not participate on robbs war councils and she keeps saying she should be at home with the little children not helping robb being a commander  which lets face it she is not really doing i also do not like her arguments with robb in the books i do not remember them ever shouting at each other if i am wrong please correct me here she is made much less likable because robb is made into this badass commander young hero the one who speaks back to jaime lannister while he is chained up and who has a large wolf which never appears when he is needed to tell volantene intruders keep distance  and you are a negative character as soon as you dare to argue with the favourite hero character if you are not a young hot volantene that is i think that robbs role has been made more important at the expense of catelyns to the point she is now a minor character only there to miss her children and look concerned my biggest fear is now that they will make catelyn talk robb into the marriage with the volantene for some idiotic reason after all these changes this could not surprise me anymore please tell me i am wrong edited by buckwheat 24 may 2012  0535 pm"

"Howdyphillip",2012-05-24,"here is another example of the negative treatment of the show that people seem hell bent on doing i dont mind discussing that there are very real differences in catelyns motivations from the show and in the books i dont even mind saying that i preferred the books version but to come out and say that they have gutted a character or that the writing is terrible is nothing more than childish over reaction this is a deliberate change from the books do you think that the producers cant read and are just doing things to piss off book fans i have no doubt that there will be a legitimate narrative reason for the change off the top of my head i would venture to guess that it will be so that the reeds can be introduced due to budget and time constraints these characters couldnt be introduced this season so they are showing up to the story late if it is general news in westeros that bran and rikon are dead then why on earth would howland send his children to him do i like this version as much as the books well no but that is a far cry from saying this show has been ruined and it is terrible or that the producers dont know what they are doing this show is not ruined catelyn has not been gutted and the use of the word terrible in relationship to this show is miles off base"
"Jolene Brown",2012-05-24,"thats like just your opinion man if someone feels catelyns motivation has been gutted then thats what they feel this is a major change like it or not and its certainly at least arguable that it greatly impacts her characterization there is a big difference between releasing jaime because she had just found out bran and rickon had been murdered and releasing him in the situation on the show the people who make this show make plenty of money they can handle some criticism from some people on a message board that i am sure they are wise enough not to read"
"Keep Shelly in Athens",2012-05-24,"what action can she take when she finds out theyre dead i imagine nothing but sit there and grieve maybe she leaves for riverrun or even worse robb sends her there really anticlimatic either way still hope they include her pressuring robb to sue for peace and return home thats my favorite scene of hers"

"Evamitchelle",2012-05-25,"of course that is my opinion just as it is the opinion of someone else that the writing is terrible and a character has been guttedmy opinion is that this is reactionary and childish and doesnt come close to describing the television show that i am watching i dislike this change as well for some of the very same reasons that people have pointed out but it most assuredly isnt bad writing nor does it dramatically effect the overall theme and tone of the series by necessity things will change in any adaptation some for the worse and some for the better that doesnt mean that the show is ruined i guess that my main objection is that this is just another thread dedicated to pointing out anything negative related to the show here is another opinionthis is a great fucking show it is my favorite fantasy series of all time and one of my all time favorite television shows periodhonestly that line is a bit patronizing i respect your opinion but youre being stupid is basically what youre saying here i think dds writing for cat is horrible like theyve missed the entire point of the character i dont think theyre doing it on purpose to piss off book fans they just have massively different interpretations on the character like when they say that jaime is a psychotic monster and that jon lacked a father figure from the portrayal of cat on the show my guess is that they see her as the good mother but not much more and in my opinion thats missing the mark for one thing catelyn should be the main character here instead of playing second fiddle to robb most of the time and following his orders like a trained puppy the idea to go talk to renly was hers as was the decision to actually talk to him instead shes being ordered around by her teenage soncat spends most of her times fighting that in the books  the prejudice that all the men around her have against her because shes a middleaged mother who never picks up a sword pretty much every major lord in robbs command tells her at one point or the other oh youre the gentle sex you dont know anything about war as a way to shut her up or try to make excuses for her with it was mothers madness and because of that prejudice they ignore her sensible advice  send anyone but theon to the iron islands exchange jaime for sansa ally yourself with renly make peace with the lannisters dont go fight lord tywin at the fords etc in the show that dimension is entirely gone because cat never says much of anything when robb is named king in the north she tays silent robb is the one who suggests going to renly she never mentions theon as an envoy etc the one thing she cant shut up about is going back to winterfell with her babies which she never says aloud iirc much less to robb i think game of thrones is a great show on the whole the actors in particular are fantastic but there a few characters that i think dd just dont get at all mainly catelyn and sansa sansa isnt even a major character anymore it seems when shes got something like 3rd most pov of all characters in clash instead they have time to include 3minutes long scenes of ros being threatened by ultimate pimp littlefinger or of joffrey torturing prostitutes because hes evil id consider that pretty mediocre writing"
"Morrigan",2012-05-25,"this show is incredibly well produced in all of its aspects the actors deliver emmy and golden globe winning performances the set design and costuming wins awards the score is worthy of a major motion picture and yes the writing is so far above par that it competes with the best scripted television that i have ever seen what i am saying is that we as fans of the works of grrm have it good we have it unprecedentedly goodthis is true to a certain extent however the reason this is true is because the source material is so good not because dd are good writers they arent im sorry they just arent and their interpretation of the characters is very very often completely out of whack"
"Marjie Eilie Myatt",2012-05-25,"this is not mediocre television this is epic fantasy storytelling on a scale that has never been seen before in this medium  the writing is so far above par that it competes with the best scripted television that i have ever seeni respectfully disagree and apologize in advance for not exactly tackling the topic of catelyns motivation being gutted in comparison to the book which i agree it has been somewhat so far we have seen very little by way of scale if you really look at it how are the battle scenes for example any bigger than certain other miniseries or series that have been produced for television including network television were getting a lot of tight shots offscreen action greatly reduced numbers of combatants synthetic environments ie cgi that is admittedly better than network fare way more dialogue about battle and killing ones foes than actual battle and handtohand combat and for all of the great banter and pointcounterpoint between and among varys littlefinger and tyrion theres still a little too much treacly writing and cliche conceptualization as far as the whoring is concerned and the romance and certain peoples backstories like what talisa revealed last week blecch theyve got a better budget for travel and set constructiondressing than something like camelot on starz but the show is not free of demerits in my book the tudors had great writing and luxurious mise en scene and lots of randy sex and bloody homicide but i would critique a lot about that one as welli think i support the production as much as anyone else in principle anyway but that doesnt mean its immune from critique mayhaps i feel theyve put their money into some aspects that i wouldnt have prioritized over other aspects"
"Grell",2012-05-25,"here is another opinion this is a great fucking show it is my favorite fantasy series of all time and one of my all time favorite television shows periodis that why you are taking any criticism of the show no matter if its well thought out logical and reasonable as if its a criticism against you personally how dare people not like the things i likei have see that whole its a transitionsetup its meant to be boring and bad elsewhere here is my opinion  it doesnt fly edited by grell 25 may 2012  0304 am"
"Buckwheat",2012-05-25,"well i think we all post here and bother watching the show because we still love the original story and the series both and find them interestingi agree that the show is big they have all those costumes many loctions shot everywhere in the world the setting looks very real the actors are awesome i rarely see any complaint about anyones delivery and i think the catelyns actress is definitely one of the best but her motivations are greatly changed from the books and her role is hugely diminishedrandom does anyone know if she has read the bookscat spends most of her times fighting that in the books  the prejudice that all the men around her have against her because shes a middleaged mother who never picks up a sword pretty much every major lord in robbs command tells her at one point or the other oh youre the gentle sex you dont know anything about war as a way to shut her up or try to make excuses for her with it was mothers madness and because of that prejudice they ignore her sensible advice  send anyone but theon to the iron islands exchange jaime for sansa ally yourself with renly make peace with the lannisters dont go fight lord tywin at the fords etc in the show that dimension is entirely gone because cat never says much of anything when robb is named king in the north she tays silent robb is the one who suggests going to renly she never mentions theon as an envoy etc the one thing she cant shut up about is going back to winterfell with her babies which she never says aloud iirc much less to robbi agree with everything you said particularly this it is like the writers share the lords opinion that a character who cannot swordfight alone cannot be a strong character but only a mother to support the one important character i have absolutely nothing against the fact that robb appears much more than in the books it makes perfect sense that they would want to show a relatively unproblematic young hero falling in love fighting and having a connection to his mother but not at the expense of catelyn"
"Cot",2012-05-25,"this is true to a certain extent however the reason this is true is because the source material is so good not because dd are good writersnail on head one of the truest things ive read on these forums even though i try stay away from these series discussion as i find some peoples positions so entrenched ive got to laughthe show continues to be good despite dd writing thanks to the quality and quantity of the actual material"

"Mulled Wino",2012-05-25,"i dont think theres a problem with her motivation if karstark gets his vengence she loses her 2 daughters in no way was letting jamie go excusable in te books or in the show no way she didnt capture him she cant let him go i think cat is shown as authoritive and capable theres definitely some variations but shes clearly a respected character her inner struggles are fascinating in the book but those are difficult to present on a show shes really just as impusive and mistakeprone as in the books so far"
"RobertOfTheHouseBaratheon",2012-05-25,"i dont believe that the show is above critique either as a matter of point i do so all the time i hold opinions that there are places in the story that the book tells a much richer and compelling tale i have made it known that i feel strongly about that in relationship to the character of catelyn stark and the changes in the nuances and motivations of her character all of this can be said without disparaging the show it seems that the majority of topics in this weeks episode discussion are negative by their very nature take for example this thread title i would take no issue whatsoever with a thread title that suggested catelyn starks character has been changed and then opened it up to discussion the op used the term gutted and in the original post used words like terrible to describe it this is just not a fair way to frame a show that is the highest rated cable production on television to further emphasize my point i would be willing to bet that michelle fairley wins her share of awards and acclaim for her portrayal of this character the writing here is changed but it most certainly isnt terrible nor has any character appearing on the show gutted i would like to have honest dialogue about these changes rather than read a bunch of reactionary outrage take for an example i wouldnt mind reading your opinions of where you think that the budget for this show would be better spent i just dont want to read another long tirade against changes in the show and how stupid dd must beyou say people can discuss how they dislike elements and characterisations in the show but you want to limit the emotive words they use we can dislike the changes to cat and say i dont like the way theyve changed cat but were not allowed to use words like gutted or terrible or express out feelings artistically through words i like the way the op has phrased the topic it a good use of language that describes the feeling the author is getting and also trigger an opinion to get people looking and commenting on the thread do you want to list all the words we cant use about the show in future so we can all be sure"
"scurvy",2012-05-25,"while its nice that many impart the new motivation that if karstark got revenge her daughters would die she didnt state that as her motivation so it wasnt you are better writers than the screenrunners sorry they took a terrific scene that a great actress could have made her own deleted it and replaced it with mild worry that is terrible because the show could have had so much more drama and instead went with cliche im not challenging the production values or whether overall its better than 95 of whats on television im saying the change that the writers made was for change sake and it was less significantly worse that the source material and that was a major mistake"
"Evamitchelle",2012-05-25,"the most annoying thing about the change of motivation is that they didnt even use it to justify cats actions the whole karstark would have killed him if i hadnt intervened doesnt get mentioned at all when robb is busy harping on his mother i thought that was the entire point of the change "
"Howdyphillip",2012-05-25,"you say people can discuss how they dislike elements and characterisations in the show but you want to limit the emotive words they use we can dislike the changes to cat and say i dont like the way theyve changed cat but were not allowed to use words like gutted or terrible or express out feelings artistically through words i like the way the op has phrased the topic it a good use of language that describes the feeling the author is getting and also trigger an opinion to get people looking and commenting on the threaddo you want to list all the words we cant use about the show in future so we can all be sureim not telling anyone what or how to say anything all i am doing is saying that when people use what i believe to be childish and reactionary tones that i have every right to say that i think they are full of crap i specifically take issue with the tone of discussion on characters from this show starting from a negative reaction from their very thread titleif i were to not have watched this show and just read the thread titles and posts here i would think that this was the sorriest show ever made that is a shame to me because it is most decidedly not that the saddest thing about all of this is that there are very good points being brought up with the changes from the books and the show but they are just being completely clouded with reactionary drivel that frame the show as bad tv if you want to call this show bad tv that is your prerogative just dont be surprised when i stand up and say that i emphatically disagree and then throw facts like awards and budget and viewership to emphasize my position"

"Howdyphillip",2012-05-25,"then create a positive thread of your own  from what ive seen on the boards most people here find the theon storyline to be have been done well and as a result theres not much point to create a thread about it because most people have the same point of view and there can only be so many i agree this is the best thing ever  before people start moving on to another subject the point of a discussion board is to generate discussion after all and most people gave the episode a 8 on the how would you rate episode 208 thread so the reaction isnt as bad as you make it out to be first of all it would be disingenuous of me to start a cheerleader thread for show catelyn because as i have already pointed out on numerous occasions i dont think that her story line on the show is nearly as enjoyable as it was in the books her nuances and motivations have been changed to be almost diametrically opposed from one anotheri also question why her motivations were not brought up in the discussion with robb and karstark but i can easily attribute that to her making a decision that at that particular moment she believed robb wasnt ready to listen to any excuses because of his overwhelming anger with her and that she was just waiting for a better time i am actually not far off in assessment from much of the discussion that is taking place here i will again say that i dont think having a discussion on the issues is a bad thing what i have been trying to convey is that all of these things can be said without the vitriol and hatred that seem to permeate the board right now starting topics with negative connotations limit discussion and gives the appearance that this show is not liked as you have pointed out the average rating from this board is an 8 i gave it a 7 as it was my least favorite episode this year you could never tell that by reading a list of topics discussing this show though that is my major complaint with the thread title and i believe the proper place to address that is within that particular thread edited by howdyphillip 25 may 2012  0945 am"

"birdsong66",2012-05-25,"i think ive said it before but ill say it again however much i like michelle fairley i think shes terrific the writers have not done catelyn stark justice not from episode one and on my hopes that shed become more like the character in the novel later in the first season never quite transpired and ive grown increasingly frustrated with the way theyve handled her this season and so im at the point where to some degree im looking forward to the red wedding so that they can put catelyn out of the picture and i dont have to keep wincing every time they make the character on the show less and less compelling it really is this cut and dry the changes to her character would make sense had catelyn not been a fully fleshed out character in the books that is simply not the case if her motivations and behavior had been at all vague or muted in presentation the changes make sense as i think everyone can agree this wasis not the case the decision to reduce catelyn to a bland sexless diluted mother archetype insults me personally and to a certain extent suggests that the producers either a dont care for the character or coolpng classbbcemoticon altb  misinterpret the character neither case being one i would spend a good deal of time defending on a board or in discussions with people i watch with and this misinterpretation has been there from episode oneremoval of it should have been you her wanting ned to be the hand her refusal to allow jon snow to stay god forbid we have a scene where she might reflect on postcoital aching loins and my personal favorite catelyn cowering against a rock while tyrion protects her versus she slices the throat of a clansman threatening tyrion every scene subsequent to that wherein her empowering book dialogue is given to everyone else in an effort to build those characters for tv viewership read one victory does not make us conquerors etc or the additional actions while somewhat badass read punching jaime with a rock make her appear somehow less than the whole reactionary trite a shadow of the original it isnt so much that we hate what dd have done or that we believe that the character has been gutted so much as the discontent that i and apparently many others feel that stems from the overall theme that catelyn is a throwaway pov character whose motivations beliefs and actions are only significant as they relate or define another characters those characters who the producers have decided are more worthy or interesting or fundamentally better i do not agree period it is also insulting to me personally and i freely admit this that the mother archetype is defined by dd for hbogot as intellectually inferior overly emotional subject to inconsistencies in thought and action and every other manner of cliche applicable i will state again it is a testament to michelle fairley and her alone that anyone even bothers with a thread on the subject of catelyn and not in any way evidence of the skill which with dd have chosen to present herthat said im really hoping hoping  that dd have chosen to present catelyn as a passive cliche of motherhoodwomanhood whatever as a means to truly define how powerless women in general are in westeros as i believe they have successfully done with other female characters in this she truly represents what cercei reflects on when stating to sansa i think dont love anyone because that love will make you do ridiculous things for those you love you cant help but love your children regardless of father but in the end it will kill you just the same taking that theme applying it to catelyn better illustrates how loyal and loving she is and defines her transformation to sh as even more disturbing because she has become that animal that loved too much tried too hard wanted and wanted ultimately denied and who without any self imposed boundries gives leave to her previous notions in favor of revenge pure true and just it could be fantastically awesome or it can wither on the vine"

"House Martell",2012-05-26,"why are you placing so much importance on member of the stark family  the stark kids werent exactly raised by their parents in the first place  septa mordane took care of the girls education rodrik cassel taught the boys to fight maester luwin is probably the one who taught them their numbers hes also the one who delivered them and old nan told them bedtimes stories its not like they have no one they know around theyre living among the people whove known them their entire lives not random strangers just because theyre not related by blood doesnt mean theyre incapable of giving them the support they need if cat had left robbs side instead would you be saying hes screwed because there is no adult member of the stark family near him  theres only one adult member of the stark family left with 5 children in 4 different locationsi went to school and had lots of teachers that doesnt mean i didnt need parents plus with cassel and luwin now left to run winterfell they have even less time for the boys and yes family members parents especially are important because no one cares about your kids as much as you do and robb is king 16 and acting as a man rickon is 4 bran is 10 and newly crippled so no its not the same as leaving robb the 2 girls are prisoners in kl cat isnt going to go riding in in full armor slaying the kings guard and freeing sansa and presumably arya my opinion is shes isnt a whole lot of good to robb where he is so that leaves bran and rickonas for cat being untrained in war yes she is thats why shes not part of his war councils she never tells him how to fight his battles and he does well without her robbs problem isnt the military strategy its the politics and in that domain catelyn can definitely help shes the eldest daughter of one of the great house raised as its heir for 910 years before edmure was born and married into another great house a ladys role isnt restricted to baking cupcakes for the entire castle so id say that 15 years of being a great lady gives her vastly more experience that robb whos only been alive for 15 years and if you cant accept that her credentials as great lady are acceptable to demonstrate political prowess then what do you make of all the other lords like roose bolton and wyman manderly that follow robb and give him advice  in any case id say that its supposed to be pretty clear that shes politically proficient given the advice she gives  try allying yourself with renly was pretty solid advice and she came up with it before anyone else including brynden seasoned in war and leading men tully dont trust the westerlings was pretty good too or dont send theon greyjoy back to the iron islandsshe had some good advice and some bad but as i said social mores of the time are that her cousel wont be heeded anyway renly didnt align with them and theon and the westerlings did betray them so what practical value did her counsel serve even if i conceed she was the most brilliant politically savy person in all of westeros no one listened so what good did it dowrt the frey alliance 1 not being a high ranking family in westeros so your point is that the freys arent good enough for the tullystarks because theyre not a great house lets take a look at those starkstullyarryn are out of the picture because well inbreeding edmure is the only available tully and hes 2425 marrying him to 10yearold arya would have been massively creepy robert arryn is the only available arryn and hes 6 sickly and a direct cousin lysa doesnt seem to mind about the last part but the sickly part is not great for marriage offers especially to arya the only available girl in the stark family at that time then you have the baratheons who are all dead or already married the main branch of tyrells are all taken except willas and loras the martells have arianne quentyn and trystane but no one really thinks about them all that much in the first place and doran has his own plans anyway and then you have the lannisters of course so all of the great houses are pretty much out which leaves the secondtier houses which means houses like the freys  theyre not really respected but theyre undeniably rich and powerful 34000 soldiers isnt a thing minor houses can afford they also have their own vassals besides great houses almost never intermarry with each other like the previous generation did starktully tullyarryn lannisterbaratheon and they usually marry their bannermen as tywin mentions 2 they needed the freys without the freys they cant even go south in the first place without the freys they lose before they even started they clearly had the advantage so they used ityes my point is the freys arent a good marriage alience for 2 of your 5 children im saying frey is her fathers sworn banner man and she had to give up two of her kids just to have him let them cross the street my point is this doesnt demonstrates a keen negotiating mind yes she did what needed to be done and i have always given her credit for procuring the twins but having children to marry off isnt an advantage that will serve robb further along in his war campaign and do you think she would have married any of her kids to freys under normal circumstances probably not so yes the rich powerfull 2nd tier freys are an undesireable matchi also find it weird that you think not giving up on something because youre not immediately getting your way is a character flaw perseverance is usually considered a good thing no what youre calling perserverence i call wasting time and not being particularly valuable while your other children need you"
"Evamitchelle",2012-05-26,"i went to school and had lots of teachers that doesnt mean i didnt need parents plus with cassel and luwin now left to run winterfell they have even less time for the boys and yes family members parents especially are important because no one cares about your kids as much as you do and robb is king 16 and acting as a man rickon is 4 bran is 10 and newly crippled so no its not the same as leaving robb the 2 girls are prisoners in kl cat isnt going to go riding in in full armor slaying the kings guard and freeing sansa and presumably arya my opinion is shes isnt a whole lot of good to robb where he is so that leaves bran and rickoni assume you didnt live with your teachers and your teachers children and i never said that parents are unnecessary what i dont understand is why you give so much value to blood relations  are maester luwin or old nan incapable of properly taking care of bran and rickon because theyre not related by blood  the kids grew up with them theyre much better suited at raising them than hoster the blackfish or lysa wouldshe had some good advice and some bad but as i said social mores of the time are that her cousel wont be heeded anyway renly didnt align with them and theon and the westerlings did betray them so what practical value did her counsel serve even if i conceed she was the most brilliant politically savy person in all of westeros no one listened so what good did it dowhats the advice youd consider bad for example  and i already gave you an example of the practical value of her advice  it saved jeyne westerlings lifeyes my point is the freys arent a good marriage alience for 2 of your 5 children im saying frey is her fathers sworn banner man and she had to give up two of her kids just to have him let them cross the street my point is this doesnt demonstrates a keen negotiating mind yes she did what needed to be done and i have always given her credit for procuring the twins but having children to marry off isnt an advantage that will serve robb further along in his war campaign and do you think she would have married any of her kids to freys under normal circumstances probably not so yes the rich powerfull 2nd tier freys are an undesireable matchso who exactly is worthy of the mighty starks  another great house  there arent any matches available and its not even the way things usually go there are only 7 great houses anyway they cant always keep marrying each other without ending like the habsburgs so what they do is marry their bannermens children see  mace tyrell and alerie hightower jon arryn and jeyne royce hoster tully and minisa whent stannis baratheon and selyse florent kevan lannister and dorna swyft etc alerie hightower is the only one of that lot to be of almost equal standing house swyft is not even a noble house but a knightly one under normal circumstances the kids would have been married to neds bannermen as said in the text so who exactly do you think would have been a more suitable match for arya or robb  they needed to go south the twins is the only place where the army can cross for hundreds of miles its defended by about 4000 men and theres a castle on each side of the river maybe you think the better strategy would have been to lay siege to the twins for a couple of years what youre calling perserverence i call wasting time and not being particularly valuable while your other children need youso your advice when facing misogyny is to just accept it and go home because its pointless thatll go faralso  i took a lot of heat around here for saying i never bought the fact that cat didnt go back to her boys and i find it way more believable that in the show she at least expresses a strong desire to go to bran and rick in the books i think the most we get is her thinking that the boys must think poorly of her not she misses them now wherever you believe the best place for her is she should at least want to be with her youngest children even if she stays elsewhere so this is one thing i feel the show has done better than the books stunnedgif classbbcemoticon altstunned  catelyn does want to go home to bran and rickon she just doesnt want to leave her 15yearold fighting a war on his own i also find it very believable that someone would wish to stay with their dying father rather than immediately go home to the wellprotected and wellcared for childrenas she slept amidst the rolling grasslands catelyn dreamt that bran was whole again that arya and sansa held hands that rickon was still a babe at her breast robb crownless played with a wooden sword and when all were safe asleep she found ned in her bed smiling fate drives me south again catelyn thought as she sipped the astringent tea when it is north i should be going north to home she had written to bran and rickon that last night at riverrun i do not forget you my sweet ones you must believe that it is only that your brother needs me moreshe knelt before the mother my lady look down on this battle with a mothers eyes they are all sons every one spare them if you can and spare my own sons as well watch over robb and bran and rickon would that i were with them i have come so many thousands of leagues and for what  who have i served  i have lost my daughters robb does not want me and bran and rickon must surely think me a cold and unnatural

"The Bloody Boar",2012-07-08,"i think cats motivation barely makes sense in either the book or the tv series trading the almost guaranteed security of having a highly valuable hostage to exchange for your daughters for the highly dubious chance that the kingslayer will keep his word assuming hes able to keep his word assuming he even makes it back to kings landing i dont care how crazed and irrational a mothers grief makes you this whole plot point is forceinserted by grrm so that he can f the starks fing the starks is one tried and tested way for grrm to provoke strong emotions in his readers however there is one way in which the tv series makes more sense than the book it looks as if catelyn has to get jaime out of there or the unruly northerners will kill him  and her daughters would then be killed by joffrey and cersei in revenge as sure as night follows day all they had to do to make this clearer was give catelyn one line like im going to have to do something or jaime will be dead by morning and my daughters will soon follow ok something a bit better written than that if catelyn could just have said one line like that before going in to see jaime it would have helped the audience make sense of it of course it would still have made much more sense for her to just protect jaime by removing him from danger disguise him hide him in her tent etc rather than just letting him go"

"Zar Lannister",2012-07-12,"ran im probably hijacking the catelyn thread with a lannister question but do you think the way the show delivered jaimes escape attempt and the killing of alton was out of character as compared to the somewhat witty attempt involving cleos in the books edited by zar lannister 12 july 2012  0302 pm"
"Le Cygne",2012-07-12,"its like they had two thoughts in mind here make catelyn grovel to robb and make jaime out to be a monster and a beast their words then force fit everything else to make that so catelyn ends up looking stupid and weak in the book she was neither and jaime ends up uncharacteristically killing a lannister in the book he called cleos coz warned him of danger when they were under attack and later expressed sympathy to his aunt who he liked so not only do the characters no longer resemble the book characters but so much is lost from a storytelling perspective in the book tyrion attempted to rescue jaime and then later we see jaime rescues tyrion jaimes swordfighting skills are brought to the fore in the book escape attempt and this underscores what he is about to lose and the oath is central to the jaimecatelynbrienne dynamic that continues right through the latest book but they just bypassed it on the show edited by le cygne 12 july 2012  1120 pm"

"Jolene Brown",2012-09-21,"i dont necessarily agree with the idea that she is beside herself with grief and completely irrational in the books she rebuts those quite dignifiedly later who try to use that as an excuse for her and says that she knew exactly what she was doing but i also dont think if that was the reason it would be such a terrible problem i dont think the idea often promoted by defenders of the tv shows approach that they are somehow fixing a problem from the books by supposedly making cats decision more logical and making robbs love interest supposedly more appealing is actually positive to me that is a more simplistic approach in which everything has to be reducible to 1  1  2 and all the heroes have to have good reasons for what they do i like that cat and robb make mistakes in the books and let their emotions sway them that was part of what made that storyline so tragic and emotional for me  that they were in an impossible situation and sometimes they didnt make very good decisions but they suffered far far far far far more than they deserved as a consequence they contributed a little to their fate but they in no way deserved their fate it makes me so sad that the shows writers have sort of in my opinion dumbed things down and chosen a less complex and rich approach to the story edited by jolene brown 21 september 2012  1153 am"

"Ran",2012-09-23,"the very first post i made in this thread was agreeing with your point that the tv show made an error in not being more clear when laying out their verson of cats reasoningim not sure why your agreeing with one thing means i should ignore some other thing i consider wrong namely your very much erroneous reading of catelyn in the last acok chapter as grieving mother loses all common sense in the hierarchy of things catelyn stark in the novels is a superior character than the one depicted in the tv series  more complicated by far your agreeing with some minor point of mine about the tv show the lesser of the two works doesnt mitigate the fact that youre wrong in youre reading of that chapter and the fact that youre wrong might be suggested by the fact that you arent trying to back up your claims that shes besides herself with grief or not entirely sure what she wants to do with him by refering back to the text and trying to prove how thats an inescapable or even defensible conclusion instead you shift to handwringing over how mean im being by noting how youre wrong and how its all relative anyways because the text apparently can say anything you want it to say and i cant hold you to just being wrong in facttopics like this have been pretty common for about 14 years now ive seen a lot of them when someone comes in and largely seems to sweep aside everything everyone else has been saying and then doesnt stick to the text it kind of sticks in the craw if you dont want to cause that reaction familiarize yourself with how statements like yours are going to be taken or at least dont start with the passiveaggressive dont get defensive or the even more insulting why are you hostileif you believe your position defend it  prove that she was irrational and that she had no clue as to what she was going to do the only thing you need to do that is to use the book"

"Jolene Brown",2012-09-23,"i dont think those quotes indicate that she was unsure what to do  they indicate that she knew exactly what she wanted to do but she was afraid that it was the wrong thing she is scared of the consequences scared that it wont work out the way she wants it to for good reason she may consider walking away from it because jaimes behavior reinforces those doubts but it doesnt mean she was just sort of winging it i would guess she has been considering this path ever since she sent cleos to kings landing in the first place so i dont think its even only branrickons deaths that motivates her  thats just sort of the final catalyst for causing her to put her plan into action"
"Ran",2012-09-23,"precisely jolene she has doubts about it being the right course but she knows what shes doing the point of talking to jaime beyond trying to understand was to see if there was any point expecting oaths of any kind from him  though as she notes and as jaime notes she was really trusting in tyrion having to follow through on a promise in open courtso herei am become a sour woman catelyn thought i take no joy in mead nor meat and song and laughter have become suspicious strangers to me i am a creature of grief and dust and bitter longings there is an empty place within me where my heart was oncesee the funny thing is we know what catelyn is like when shes consumed by grief its not this its more like thislady stark was there beside his bed she had been there day and night for close on a fortnight not for a moment had she left brans side she had her meals brought to her there and chamber pots as well and a small hard bed to sleep on though it was said she had scarcely slept at all she fed him herself the honey and water and herb mixture that sustained life not once did she leave the room so jon had stayed awaylady stark looked over for a moment she did not seem to recognize him finally she blinked what are you doing here she asked in a voice strangely flat and emotionlessher face did not change her long auburn hair was dull and tangled she looked as though she had aged twenty years youve said it now go awaywhen she opened them again they told her that she had slept four days catelyn nodded and sat up in bed it all seemed like a nightmare to her now everything since brans fall a terrible dream of blood and grief but she had the pain in her hands to remind her that it was real she felt weak and lightheaded yet strangely resolute as if a great weight had lifted from hercatelyn remembered the way she had been before and she was ashamedso what we really have is catelyn in agot briefly going well and truly mad with grief until she comes out of it versus her grieving deeply but being quite fully rational and selfawarei want them all dead brienne theon greyjoy first then jaime lannister and cersei and the imp every one every one but my girls    my girls will   the but is that if the lannisters start dying so will her daughters shes thought it throughshe stared at her scarred hands opened and closed them then slowly raised her eyes ive sent him wine wine brienne was lost robb or    theon greyjoy the kingslayer the ploy had served her well with cleos frey i hope youre thirsty jaime i hope your throat is dry and tight i would like you to come with me i am yours to command my lady good catelyn rose abruptly stay finish your meal in peace i will send for you later at midnightshes planned it out shes going to use the same stratagem she used with cleos to loosen jaimes tongue in hopes of discovering understanding of what happened and of him to try and secure her aims as best she canbut theres no one to find me now is there this time i have to find our own way and it is hard so hardand here she knows the path is difficult shes thinking about the enormity of it the costs but also the potential benefit i keep remembering the stark words winter has come father for me for me robb must fight the greyjoys now as well as the lannisters and for what for a gold hat and an iron chair surely the land has bled enough i want my girls back i want robb to lay down his sword and pick some homely daughter of walder frey to make him happy and give him sons i want bran and rickon back i want    catelyn hung her head i want she said once more and then her words were gonewell that last is about wanting ned or things to be as they were and she cant finish that sentence because that wont happen but its clear that shes recognizing both the futility of robbs war it is futile at this stage and the enormous amount shes lostand then to show that catelyn had thought this all through pretty well look how smoothly her plan goes offhed been very drunk by then thanks to catelyn stark of their escape from riverrun he recalled only bits and pieces there had been some trouble with the gaoler but the big wench had overcome him after that they had climbed an endless stair around and around his legs were weak as grass and hed stumbled twice or thrice until the wench lent him an arm to lean on at some point he was bundled into a travelers cloak and shoved into the bottom of a skiff he remembered listening to lady catelyn command someone to raise the portcullis on the water gate she was sending ser cleos frey back to kings landing with new terms for the queen shed declared in a tone that brooked no argumentso she absconds with a chained jaime she puts off the gaoler she secures an exit and a boat she gets a hold of cleos to provide cover for her plan and so on this isnt the stuff of a sudden decision shes thought it through she even thinks through to what will come afterwardser desmond nodded plainly glad to be done with his distasteful task but sadeyed utherydes wayn lingered a moment after the castellan took his leave it was a grave thing you did my lady but for naught ser desmond has sent ser robin ryger after them to bring back the kingslayer  or failing that his headcatelyn had expected no less may the warrior give strength to your sword arm brienne she prayed she had done all she could nothing remained but to hopeshes not overcome with grief unable to think rationally or sensibly  far from it the picture is very different from the truly drivenoutofhermind catelyn shortly after brans fall indeed she goes out of her way to note the fact that she was fully in command of herself was entirely aware of what she was doing and its consequencesthe news must have driven you mad ser desmond broke in a madness of grief a mothers madness men will understand you did not knowi did catelyn said firmly i understood what i was doing and knew it was treasonous if you fail to punish me men will believe that we connived together to free jaime lannister it was mine own act and mine alone and i alone must answer for it put me in the kingslayers empty irons and i will wear them proudly if that is how it must be loves not always wise ive learned it can lead us to great folly but we follow our hearts  wherever they take us dont we motheris that what i didso the two propositions  that she was mad with grief abandoning all common sense because this is allegedly some trope in the novels and that she didnt really know what she was doing  are wrong the nearest you get is her stepping away ignoring the fact that she didnt actually need to talk to him to execute her plan and that it may all have been a bit of gamesmanship to try and prompt him to engage with herto go further davids on the mark with the idea that criticizing a criticism of the text grounded on misreading in the text is somehow not allowing people to criticize the text you just need to do a good job of it repeating shoddy readings of the character that fail to take into account all the evidence isnt the way to go about it edited by ran 24 september 2012  0205 pm"

"Winter's Lion",2012-09-24,"hmmm it troubles me as both a newbie to asoiaf and as a writer that people can be criticised for criticising grrms writing the man isnt infalliable otherwise he would have made a better character of catelyn i really like her and i loved this scene with jaime but others cannot stand her for many of her actions both big and small the release of jaime does seem more of a rash act than one that was thought through imho i believe she went in there only to question himi think she only went in there to question him too hence the getting him drunk with the wine i think she wanted to loosen his tongue with it if she had wanted to get someone drunk she could have just as easily tried to get the guard drunk a passed out guard  someone else to blame for the escape didnt someone else use that ploy later in the books i cant remeber off the top of my head but it seems familiar"
"Ran",2012-09-25,"alas winters lion has departed us but ill be responding to her points here for the benefit of others so they dont find themselves pulled into the same lack of rigor in their approach to discussing the seriesi think catâ<U+0080><U+0099>s grief takes a different form because the two situations is different as tyrion said iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m paraphrasing here â<U+0080><U+0093> â<U+0080><U+009C>death is so final life is full of possibilitiesâ<U+0080><U+009D> in the first situation sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s right beside bran thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the possibility that he could have woken up at any moment so she stayed with him night in day even to the detriment of her other children in the second situation she believes that her children are dead thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no possibility that they will ever wake up no possibility that they will ever get better sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s also in a completely different place so itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not like she can even stand vigil beside the bodiesthis makes very little sense you see the claim was made that she had lost all common sense that she was overwhelmed by her grief and therefore didnt act rationally in all of this that follows notice how the possibility of catelyn being rational is never really engaged with however the argument takes as its guiding principle that catelyn cant be rational you see so anything that flies in the face of that must be open to interpretationthe reason i didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t take anything from asos into account is that timewise itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pretty far removed from the eventa few hours  far removed and we have her in her own head being perfectly cleareyed about it never wavering from the rational argument for what she did never accepting the narrative that oh youre a woman you were just emotionalto read into those quotes above the idea that in fact shes truly being irrational and her selfjustifications are simply driven from her being mad with grief is to read the text very badly indeedwhat martin chose to write was â<U+0080><U+009C>catelyn had expected no lessâ<U+0080><U+009D> what he didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t choose to write was â<U+0080><U+009C>catelyn had expected no less when she came up with the plan right after she heard about the boysâ<U+0080><U+0099> deaths or even â<U+0080><U+009C>catelyn had expected no less when she sat and though about it while she was being confinedâ<U+0080><U+009D> i refuse to believe that he didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t fully explain catâ<U+0080><U+0099>s thought because of some error of omissionâ<U+0080><U+0093> heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s too good a writer for thatcatelyn stark is of all the characters in the series excepting perhaps davos the most emotionally selfaware and honest she doesnt have traumas in the past that lead her to allude to her feelings she says what they are she doesnt lie to herself about having emotions she may pretend emotions to others that she doesnt feel but she tells us this in her own thoughts and yet this argument presented to us wants to convince us that somehow at the end of a clash of kings she changes radically shes a liar to herself about how she felt and how her emotions impacted her in her own thoughts having been driven mad with grief irrational lacking common senseit flies in the face of her characterization do we really need grrm to spell things out for us to accept obvious truths he basically has provided all the pieces to understand catelyn here shifting the goal posts by deciding to eliminate from consideration evidence detrimental to ones argument and then going and resting the whole of an argument on just the one chapter where for literary effect grrm wants a surprise and a cliffhanger so he reveals less of catelyns intentions than he normally would is folly the next chapter always explains what that cliffhanger was about and the explanation we get is that catelyn planned and executed jaimes escape and she did it with full awareness and understanding of what she was doingiâ<U+0080><U+0099>m trying to prove that martin is a good enough writer that he can inspire this type of debatethe debate martin might have intended to inspire was surely whether it was the wrong or right choice the argument that she lost all common sense is a belief that it was the wrong choice because it was irrational and not thought out it seems that if we are to argue the merits of the choice the fact that it was rational  right or wrong it was rational  seems to be a necessary prerequisite mad actions that make no rational sense arent worth debatingi fail to see what is â<U+0080><U+009C>shoddyâ<U+0080><U+009D> about my analysisi refuse to look at any other evidence because its so so far removed shoddy yesyour interpretation is the only possible one and that cat is the bestest character evareureka the truth at last i never justified her actions by saying shes the greatest character i pointed out the facts the text that anyone with eyes can read but oh you think shes the best character ever therefore your criticisms cant be righttake this as an object lesson dear readers dont do that if you want to be taken seriously youve lost the argument at this pointyouâ<U+0080><U+0099>re the one thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s saying thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s only one possible interpretation and i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think martin writes like thatoh hed be a terrible author if that were true surely everyone agrees with that no theres plenty thats open to only one interpretation and theres plenty thats open to multiple interpretations but this particular thing you want to claim that she was irrational in her last chapter that everything she says about it has to be ignored because shes irrational and selfdeluding for the rest of the series until her death noi think she only went in there to question him too hence the getting him drunk with the wine i think she wanted to loosen his tongue with itwhy did she need brienne she wasnt afraid of him hurting her  he was in chains if she wanted just to question him she wasnt planning to kill him so she doesnt need briennes sword shes not the sort to rough people up so she wasnt planning to tell brienne to beat him up if he didnt answer her questionsthe obvious answer is the very thing we see she meant to spirit jaime away with briennes help the questioning was as i said way back when merely to try and come to grips with him and what he did and why things had happened as they did to try and get at the truth but either way she was sending him off this was after all the best opportunity much of the garrison drunk or passed out drunk from celebratingif she had wanted to get someone drunk she could have just as easily tried to get the guard drunk a passed out guard  someone else to blame for the escapebut thats not catelyn stark she doesnt make choices that involve leaving the blame on others she doesnt foist the blame for how she acted after brans fall on anyone else she doesnt say oh well i was crazy then lets forget about it  she goes and feels guilt and shame for it she feels guilt long afterward when shes in vale shes driven by the need to make up for what in this present day and age would have been understood as a mental breakdown beyond her control but for catelyn it was a failure and she doesnt mean for it to happen again and it doesntshe owns her actions those who argue otherwise are making a fundamental misreading of the character her actions may be the wrong choice but theyre rationally motivated not driven by a lack of common sense she has more common sense in her pinkie than most characters do in the series really edited by ran 25 september 2012  0638 am"

"Castel",2012-05-21,"im starting a thread because i know this is going to get a lot of discussion i actually started to like ros this season and i thought that scene played out very well and for the purists let me just say that i for one am relieved that we didnt have a young black girl stripped and beaten by a bunch of wealthy white aristocrats im not typically politically correct by any means and i understand compartmentalizing a fantasy series versus the real world but there is just waaaaay too much baggage behind the original scene from the books this is the only way it could work and it didi dont get your point here much much more terrible shit has happened over the course of the show wealthy aristocrats beat up on everyone alayaya wouldnt be that big a leap i dont see the issue hereas for ros well they have her on the books and it makes a bit more sense than introducing a random whore but i guess cersei was desperate i just cant see her jumping on someone with only tangential connection with tyrion i mean did he ever see her after the trip to winterfell its quite possible that she won the necklace there or at least that was my initial thought but the more i think about it it is mighty suspicious that tyrion shows up in kings landing and ros ends up there as well with the same necklace and kudos to them for showing the necklace long before it was actually usedmeh hopefully this means ros goes away for a while now i get it shes a nice bridging character and you dont have to find somebody to take her place but the fact that ninety percent of the gratuitous sex scenes involve her has totally made me hate her character"

"Envie",2012-05-22,"i agree with this the actress that plays ros does it very well its a shame though that her character is wasted on sexposition but i guess that from here shell be used by house lannister and given to ramsay bolton as sansa stark she knows the people of winterfell shes redhaired and it would have more impact on the dynamic between theon and arya or in this case sansa and hopefully becoming usefulwhile i can see how you came to these theories red hair connection to theon  i cannot possibly imagine how they would get viewers to buy in to having ros stand in for jayne poole as the fake arya or as a fake sansa at all the actress for ros is clearly a full grown very curvy woman not a young girl who has just barely gotten her first period and certainly not a scrawny little tomboy like arya no one not even those characters who have never met sansa or arya would be fooled by that and especially anyone at winterfell who knew ros no way they cant possibly think that would work from a filming standpointive seen this theory before and honestly if thats what they intend to use ros for after this im going to really start losing more esteem for the writers i think using ros as alayaya was a great move and they dont really need to do anything else with her after this she filled an important role in the plot from the books is it necessary for her to be someone else too"
"sagaz",2012-05-22,"im starting a thread because i know this is going to get a lot of discussion i actually started to like ros this season and i thought that scene played out very well and for the purists let me just say that i for one am relieved that we didnt have a young black girl stripped and beaten by a bunch of wealthy white aristocrats im not typically politically correct by any means and i understand compartmentalizing a fantasy series versus the real world but there is just waaaaay too much baggage behind the original scene from the books this is the only way it could work and it didi didnt read the whole thread but i think the ros character is going to fill every salient whore in the books in my last reread i kept figuring her face in that scene at the wall were jon is in a tower with satin some other guy and a whore from mole town throwing arrows at the wildlings the attack before stannis make his entrance the one when ygritte dies also im almost confident that she somehow would be one of mances spearwives when we get thereedit choosing of words edited by sagaz 22 may 2012  1244 pm"

"Jolene Brown",2012-05-22,"i just reread this whole section of the book i honestly dont see why they couldnt have done it exactly that way  catelyn is in trouble with robbs men in his absence for releasing the kingslayer  he comes home with his new bride and everyone flips out that would have been a shocking twist on the tv show much more interesting than a fairly cliched meet cute and pretty standard romantic drama banter then explore the aftermath and get to know jeyne as his new bride its not like he had to be offscreen very long send him off to conquer the crag in episode five or six do your kingslayer drama with him gone in episode seven bring him back with her in episode eight i honestly dont see why we had to meet her before she married him there is plenty of time between then and the red wedding for us to get to know her and the point of the red wedding anyway is that we mourn catelyn and robb the characters we have come to love since the beginning of the story not that we mourn robbs lost relationship i truly dont think there was any need to change it for tv  in fact i actually think on tv it would have worked better this way and provided a much more interesting surprise by the time robb and talisa slept together on the show it was painfully obvious that was where it was headed but who the hell could have seen him showing up with his new wife from the enemys ranks in the wake of the kingslayer release im not trying to be a super purist or a whiner although i definitely hate the storyline we got i just really think the book storyline would have been more interesting on the show as well and could have worked just fine edited by jolene brown 22 may 2012  0150 am"

"KC_Accidental",2012-05-22,"i agree that the writing for her scenes have generally been poor and i have big reservations about the way she spends more time at robbs side than his generals or other soldiers his men are now so accustomed to her being there that when his rider approaches he addresses her as well as robb roose bolton taking leave from robbs tent and saying my lady is fine that is common courtesy though i would suspect he wouldnt bother in the books as she is just a commoner ill let it slide though but soldiers addressing her as a noble when giving vital news to their king no anyway i think last nights scene with talissa giving her back story was very well done i think they have tried to humanise her character with good morals so robb has something to be attracted to morally shes a good woman and robb sees that i think that is very well done but the execution up until that scene has been woeful and robb himself has been dire wolf i dont want to marry the frey girl stinks of being a petulant little teenager i get that he is a teenager or there abouts but he shouldnt be a petulant complaining little shit but talissas story not only tells us that shes a good woman and like robb and ned she doesnt care about gold glory and all the other noble nonsense but it also gives us a nice little insight into volantis im not sure why people are complaining so much about her not being jeyne though i get that it was confusing at first not knowing if it was her or not but do people actually cry out at night because theyre not getting a character we knew almost nothing about my memories of jeyne are that she cried a lot i think its also much better that theres an actual love interest here and not some noble bint shacking up with robb after knowing him for a couple days it could also be seen as taking advantage on both their parts one from the point of view of captor and prisoner and the other because she knew robb was distraught and grieving over his brothers deaths i mean come on does that actually ever happen in real life aww youre upset about someone dying here let me get into bed with you and â your ââ so overall im happy with the outcome but full heartedly agree that the scenes could have been done better or put to better use theres a war going on really i couldnt have guessed it everyone sits on their arses all day talking to people they shouldnt be talking to"

"eyeheartsansa",2012-05-24,"remember though robb is not in trouble for having sex he is in trouble for marrying the first girl he has sex with and thus breaking a marriage contract up to this point on the show he hasnt actually broken the pact aside from admitting that he doesnt want to go through with it ill be interested in seeing how the rest of this plays out i appreciate the robbtalisa story because we all know whats going to happen we dont know the details there are some awful moments of corniness but im glad they are at least keeping me guessing is robb going to be stupid and rebellious and just say screw the freys  so far it looks this way in the book id had the impression he was just trying to be honorable but since it happens offpage we only know how he explained it to his mom on the other hand most guys tend to sugarcoat things for their moms  so that wouldnt surprise me either edited by eyeheartsansa 24 may 2012  0949 am"

"Rickon is FIERCE",2012-05-21,"my thoughts on this from another threadyes yes yes yes a lot of tyrions depth has been lost from brains to balls the only sign of his superior intellect has been the pycelle trap there have been no sex scenes with shae which are purposefully all over the booksunfortunate bc i think the contrast of how hed be with shae whom he loves vs his interlude with ros last season wouldve been good for character development as it is theyve whitewashed him quite a bit no participation in tyshas rape no sex this season no threats to tommen after the alayayaros beating no cersei poisoning why show him getting the drug from pycelle in the first place over the top prince charming setup of the forthcoming sansa marriagevery little substance conflict darkness or depth all of which make him such a fantastic character"

"Kessell",2012-10-25,"the main critisism one of my non watching friends has speaks to this point as others have pointed out an interesting conversation can be enough action but the structure of far too many scenes enough that it becomes easy to observe and find annoying has to do with two or three people exchanging lines  letting each other finish speaking near perfectly while the camera flashes from 1 face to the other his point was that is what breaks immersion far more than any fantasy element he discribed it as looking at a theatre stage instead of feeling in the mitst of the actors  story obviously this is an entirly personal critique that i dont happen to share but the style they often adopt in dialog scenes is clearly visible as focus on lots of single shots as opposed to long steady shots of the entire set or something inbetween dispite the many directors though for instance nutter is far more guilty of it than others"

"Maester Bater",2012-05-25,"i think that in the first season they were a lot more faithful to the book in terms most of the scenes that were in the book were almost wordforword and it just sounded great this season however even the scenes taken from the book barely resemble them in terms of dialogue and has made this season so much weaker in my opinion"
"Greywolf2375",2012-05-25,"true but perhaps they thought that was just going a little bit overboard they perhaps didnt want that hanging over cats characterisationcould bewhatever their reason it was a loss as that would have been a brutal scene to see and i miss it"
"SerMixalot",2012-05-25,"utilizing the books dialogue tremendously improves the tv series adding a literary feel to the story removing and changing the dialogue to tv cliches harms the series changing cats line shows a lack of bravery as it would take some courage to have a main heroine speak something so negative"
"eyeheartsansa",2012-05-25,"i vaguely remember dd saying that they felt the look she gave him was enough to convey her wordsyes i heard this as welltv is just a different medium there are different tricks of the trade the ultimate goal is to produce quality premium tv and not to please every fan there are incredible time and budget constraints to work with good actors can speak paragraphs with their faces the little exchange where tyrion awkardly almosthugs cercei and cercei pulls back they both look so lost and confused it is masterful acting the series is rich with moments like this and its much more enjoyable if you just put the books out of your mind and enjoy it as a tv seriesi may be wrong but i think if youre looking for a more faithful adaptation through another medium you might enjoy the graphic novels"
"victim",2012-05-25,"because it should have been you is a terrible cheesy clichad line that is used all the time across tonnes of mediums it works well enough in the books but on the show it would have been intolerably melodramatic especially seeing as at that point we hadnt had too much background info on jon other than he was a bastard thats just your example though there have been times this season especially where i wish they kept the original dialogue i cant imagine theyll change the jaime lannister sends his regards line though only if jaime and roose meet which i pray they will"
"Tadco26",2012-05-25,"i wouldnt assume anything as far as what they will or wont leave in the show in the future i do wish they would make more attempts to stick to the dialogue some times it is frustrating when they half keep a phrase like when tyrion was talking to jon in season 1 for example and he told jon that every dwarf is a bastard in his fathers eyes but they left out the second part which was not every bastard needs to be a dwarf which i though was a pretty powerful line of course everyone has their favorite lines and they cant include them all but it is frustrating to see one of your favorites cut and then have them make screen time for a fart joke they made up"

"Rickon is FIERCE",2012-05-24,"ps im very excited to make my first post on the wonderful forum after weeks of lurking hello everyonewelcomeis anyone else also a bit peeved at the reveal of bran and rickon being in the crypts this wouldve been excellent as a reveal in episode 10 here it just came across as weak im starting to think they might be moving the sack of winterfell to s3 so it can open with a bang else why waste such good potentiali am even if the viewers didnt believe br were dead nonreaders would still have the looming suspensequestion of where are they suspense is never a bad thing in storytelling not sure why they chose to do it this way perhaps there will turn out to be a reason but im waiting for that like im waiting for a reason for dontos appearance in ep 1 tyrions obtaining of the diuretic in another early ep the point of the tywinarya scenes other than showing us a new cool interaction just for its own sake on and onyou may be right on the sack but i rather think not simply because so much needs to go into seasons 34 already however it is possible theyll move it considering how much is supposed to wrap up in the next two eps to finish off clash im really not sure why we had to have so much from storm find its way into this season other than to make sure actors like ncw had something to do when bookwise theyd be missing for nearly an entire season"
"Michaelj",2012-05-24,"why would ramsey have brought ravens with him small probably pointless point buthe has to get to return to send a raven eventually"
"RobertOfTheHouseBaratheon",2012-05-25,"the question is are dd that blasphamous that they may add lewin sending a raven to notify them that they are alive maybe theyll find out just before the rw and go from happiness to death cat may convince robb not to let anyone else know incase it jepodises the boys lives i would not put it passed them to screw with the storyline that much"
"LordMarani",2012-05-25,"i think the fake deaths were really poorly handled with the obvious foreshadowing ill send two orphan boys the boys we sent live here etc etc everyone already knew that those were the ones killed instead of bran and rickon it was only a question of when they return instead of if without that foreshadowing and just bran and rickon escaping and theon finding the walnut in the woods the deaths would have been a lot more shocking to readers and then they could be revealed in the series finale cheering osha for her wits instead even luwin knows where they are in the next episode osha running around in winterfell with nobody noticing another plotline so much weaker than it could have been sigh"
"RobertOfTheHouseBaratheon",2012-05-25,"also if i recall in the books werent bran  rickon hiding in a house or stone building of some kind then we get theon pov of the dogs loosing the scent at this millers house you thought how are they going to escape then bang two heads on a spike and theon telling himself he had to do it so he didnt look weak would that be so hard to do on telly have the boys hiding in a building then next shot over theons shoulder seeing the millers house thunders down on horse next scene hes convincing lewin he had to do it showing small amounts of remorse lewin devestated heads shown on spikes wait until ep10 for the reveal i can only think they didnt want the audience to think they were dead for a second maybe they thought people would turn off after"
"Tormund_BloggersBane",2012-06-01,"and where is ramsay through all of this i dont know how they can tie in his involvement now that the millers boys are already tarred and hung without him even been introduced there are some fairly big plot failings so far that will only be amplified as the story progresses"
"Arkash",2012-05-21,"okay so a ship with a good captain leaves for astapor tommorow i guess then we will see dany leave qarth and probably see barristan too in her last scene of the season what do you think  that would mean shes rushing to the hotu at the end of the episode "

"Chelly",2012-05-22,"just going by the episode description it seems the hotu will happen in the final episode i like the idea of ser barristan showing up in her final scene it would be so much better than him just popping up next season"
"Arkash",2012-05-22,"yeah that is why im quite certain of too she will leave qarth on that ship at the end of the episode so they dont have to rebuild the whole qarth setup next season and to end up this story arc it is perfect to end it this way "
"Gogossos",2012-05-22,"but in order to work for tv theyll have to essentially reveal barristan to the tv audience his scene from the throne room will have to be in the previously scenes his disguise shouldnt be too good etc then the nonbook viewers can say isnt that barristan  with dany thats the reaction they want as a cliffhanger"
"Lexicdark",2012-05-22,"i do wonder how they are going to set the whole thing up before he saved her life now she will be fleeing the city and he is just going to be there i guess that is okay but i liked how he showed his loyalty to her first"

"A Dark And Stormy Knight",2012-05-25,"this is a wonderful threadi remember back when stephen dillane was announced as stannisi had seen him act before in a totally different role but as i read through the books i could hear his voice whenever i read stannis lineshe hadnt even appeared in the show yet and he had so completely become the voice of stannis for me he uses his fairly limited screen time so well that one facial expression of his can speak paragraphs by far one of my favorite casting decisions this show has madeyasha and theon was an unexpected treat particularly dont die so far from the sea i did not expect that moment between them and i really enjoyed seeing itone minor thing that really helped sell the scope of the series for me was the brief exchange between tyrion and varys talking about dany possibly being alive with her dragons just being implicitly reminded that these two sets of characters the kings landing gang and danys people are part of the same of show and yet have never interacted in any way drew my attention to just why this shows approach to storytelling is so uniqueedit i also enjoy the way liam cunningham says potatoes edited by a dark and stormy knight 25 may 2012  1010 pm"

"Envie",2012-05-21,"at first i was really disappointed the weasel soup plot was being cut from aryas harrenhal story because like many others it was one of my favorite parts in the book but in thinking on it from a filming standpoint i think i can understand maybe why they decided not to put it in and instead have arya be tywins cup bearer for the entirety of her captivity there heres my bullet points on possible reasons why they decided to play it the way they have making arya tywins cup bearer gave us tons and tons of exposition material she was basically privy to every battle plan he made and even though we know she cant do anything about it its still a great tool for us the invisible audience to get filled in on a lot of details as they played out  the casting and scene shoots necessary to make arya become nan and weasel and even the ghost of harrenhal would have been immense and theyve already put a lot of effort into making harrenhal look pretty believable with the number of cast members and extras there all that for a few scenes in a couple of episodes they had to look at the overall cost of scenes that basically do not propel the story line forward overall yes i agree its immensely important for aryas personal character development but was it really that important for the overall story of the war happening outside the castle no complicating aryas journey down the dark black hole towards future assassin at this point in the series isnt really as necessary as everyone may think it is for the viewer who doesnt know the books theyre getting a pretty good idea that aryas not your average little girl and that her thoughts and motivations are becoming much more adultlike and moving her further and further from innocence i dont think anyones going to feel shes lessened by the lack of murders at this point shes still quite a ways away from the worst of it in her story that being said i do agree with those who felt she should have at least had one death scene with a guard to better solidify her bravery and willingness to kill for what she wants shes already showing more balls than hot pie and gendry combined but having them see her kill a man would have really put her in perspective for everyone i wonder if theyre still playing her down as a helpless child until after the finale of this season and her journey to bravos i also thought the naming of jaqen scene was a little more awkward than i had hoped for and i would have preferred it play out more like the book except that theyve changed all that so its letting their lesser skill slip a bit in comparison to how martin deftly twisted the plot for us theyve done a magnificent job in other areas with the changes theyve made so i have to assume that this was just a little bit of a stumble over dialogue that had to be changed since theres no captives to be freed and they wanted a way for that scene to play out with the same emphasis on her clever ability to twist jaqen into doing what she wants much more awkwardly done however"

"Nagisa Furukawa",2012-05-21,"heres the thing about aryas story at harrenhall in the books its clearly split up into two distinct sections one where the lannisters are in control of it and another where the north is for many reasons this has been compressed into one storyline where its only the lannisters there are many clear reasons for this it gives us arya as tywins cupbearer instead of rooses thus providing tension and exposition it allows roose to stay by robbs side and set him up as robbs righthand man over this season and the next making his murder of robb at the red wedding all the more shocking and just the general issue of limited time to tell this storyi bring this up because weasel soup is inherently linked with the idea that there are two sections of aryas harrenhall story its a transition between the two with the freeing of the north men and whatnot without the north coming to harrenhall and without the weasel stuff at all since aryas secondhalfofharrenhall material being a cupbearer was chosen as her role there in the show theres really no need for weasel soup other than the fact that it is admittedly a pretty cool scene but from a pragmatic pointofview it makes absolute sense to merge arya forcing jaqen to do her bidding by using his name and their escape from harrenallsame with arya murdering the guard thats the finale to the second half of the harrenhall material after shes given the coin by jaqen and is becoming darker and more ruthless shes not there yet as a character so it makes total sense not have her do it this early but next season id bet good money that the harrenhall escape scene from the book is adapted in some form in a future scene the shows truncating the actual events of aryas story its true but from what i can see its still headed for the brotherhood the hound and braavos with all the darkness and murder that implies"

"Versiroth",2012-05-21,"arya ordered the killing of several men this season just because she didnt kill them herself doesnt change the fact that theyre dead because of her its like some of you just cant read between the lines here how is she innocent in the show if several people are dead on her command she also showed that she is quick witted and very adaptable when tywin accused her of being noble born she kept coming back at him with answers to continue her cover up even thought he expected she was high born she never gave in and revealed it to be true all of the things that happen still lead into her future very well"

"Gogossos",2012-05-21,"ok this is how i view it essentially the writers and the actors had so much fun with the aryatywin dynamic we got them 3 episodes in a row and they advanced nothing except maybe for some exposition on their own i love those scenes too and i wish maise gets an emmy nomination for them coz she deserves it going toe to toe with charles dance but for aryas character growth and path only one episode with 3 of those scenes wouldve sufficed using the same screen time arya actually got i would have shifted one of the torture scenes to arya in the kitchens working hard like a commoner then tywin arrives notices her and makes her his cupbearer we get those awesome exposition things we got minus the littlefinger diversion whose screen time is then used for the weasel soup as for the kills i wouldnt have changed much of the first two only that amory doesnt die in front of tywin because that raises unnecessary questions we didnt necessarily need the northman captured for the weasel soup the same random prisoners from earlier in the season would do so as far as i can tell they changed aryas harrenhal set up partly because it was cheaper one room set with a table and chairs and also because they had too much fun with maisiecharless chemistry i have to repeat that i loved the aryatywin dynamic too but ultimately it added little to the show while removing the weasel soup the other thing is i have to wonder whether there are age restriction rules about portraying how dark such a young character can be edited by gogossos 21 may 2012  0733 pm"

"Mulled Wino",2012-05-23,"disappointed in how they turned her arc in this and the last episode weasel soup would not have fit in to the story the way they portrayed things happening but would have been nice to see  to me that was one of the things that helped jaqen decide to give her the coin how she was able to be part of that and play it outnot having her name tywin as soon as lorch was dead is a mistake in writing  they showed us she knows tywin is dangerous yet this impetuous little fireball waitsshe went to plan b escaping with her friends perfectly plausible"
"Silverx2",2012-05-23,"not naming tywin right away wasnt just because she was slow on the uptake tywin treated her well she was relatively safe while he was around and from a couple of instances she ate better then most of tywins own men twin took her from sleeping in a puddle of mud to spending her nights indoors i think ultimately tywin leaving caught her off guard im sure she thought she had more time maybe she expected tywin to say ill leave tomorrow at first dawn which would give her time to talk to jh instead tywin said ill ride at once this left no time for her to plan with jh"
"Greywolf2375",2012-05-23,"well its the same in the book george had already put her through enough horror  and she is learning and she gains more street smarts  but not enough  she names two unimportant louts before realizing that she could have name somebody who would make a differencethat was georges decision to develop her that wayat least on the show the first victim was a real lout who deserved itthe second was a situation that saved her skinin the book she did not even think to take out tywin until he was really long long gone so i give d and d credit for her coming around faster tho not fast enoughthats the problem though  the show tells us she knows he is a target by staring at his neck with a knife and has told us that she knows she sometimes needs to run to get it taken care of immediately like lorch and then drops the ball with it by ignoring it"

"Gogossos",2012-05-23,"wow a lot of people have given up on tvaryas character already just because she didnt kill a guard in that exact moment in the show doesnt mean she isnt going to kill one in the same manner in the next two episodes or next seasoni said earlier that the plot will probably catch up with the books quickly enough but the character might not whitering explained better what i meantwhat has she done in the show to convince jaqen that she would be a good recruit she saved him and has taken on a different persona is that it in the book he genuinly liked her i really like this arya and there are lots of reasons to admire her character but i dont think he has any reason to like her the way he did in the books and certainly no reason to see her potential and ability to learn heck they havent really pressed that home while in the books it is kind of central to her character she wont learn things she considers useless but nobody will put in more work and try harder to learn things she considers worthwile we havent gotten the lessons about barefeet or much elsel we havent seen as much of her intuition and she only goes to jaqen when she is desperatethere are lots of tiny things that are in the books which are not critical to the adaptations plot but are critical to aryas character basically dd should have decided that arya is one of the main characters and her turning point a critical juncture was harrenhal she met and impressed jaqen one of the super expensive assassins in the world while she spent most of asos intending to head to riverrun and family safety place in the world etc most of that was pulled right underneath her by the rw she was then left alone believing her only two remaining siblings were in no position to help her so she follows jaqens path so for me there are three critical ingredients to her narrative she suffers a lot and is put in desperate situations numerous times she has the inner strength to survive she is talented and is focused enough to be a faceless woman an elite profession the weasel soup was definitely part of the third ingredient it gave jaqen enough of a glimpse into her potential talents the fact that dd can nonchalantly write off one of the most important moments of one of the main characters not to mention its popularity fills me with a certain uneasiness edited by gogossos 23 may 2012  0511 pm"

"summer_stark",2012-05-23,"i said earlier that the plot will probably catch up with the books quickly enough but the character might not whitering explained better what i meant there are lots of tiny things that are in the books which are not critical to the adaptations plot but are critical to aryas character basically dampd should have decided that arya is one of the main characters and her turning point a critical juncture was harrenhal she met and impressed jaqen one of the super expensive assassins in the world while she spent most of asos intending to head to riverrun and family safety place in the world etc most of that was pulled right underneath her by the rw she was then left alone believing her only two remaining siblings were in no position to help her so she follows jaqens path so for me there are three critical ingredients to her narrative she suffers a lot and is put in desperate situations numerous times she has the inner strength to survive she is talented and is focused enough to be a faceless woman an elite profession the weasel soup was definitely part of the third ingredient it gave jaqen enough of a glimpse into her potential talents the fact that dampd can nonchalantly write off one of the most important moments of one of the main characters not to mention its popularity fills me with a certain uneasinessi agree with this post  obv since i started this thread still i was thinking about weasel soup v what the show did and it struck me that the weasel soup scene has very little to do warya  both the guard killing and weasel soup have little to do with her the differences are she isnt thinking big picture she is only thinking of herself  and the main thing is that she didnt escape on her own however in terms of the actual importance of weasel soup my favorite scene in acok it seems now in thinking about it that it is less important to her storyline than her reasoning behind itthe important things are 1 she pulls her clever trick on jaqenhere the clever trick fell flat in the show  which really bothered me they tried to pick up where the book left off wrt naming tywin  only thinking about it as he was leaving and not finding jaqen in time however in the show this makes a lot less sense than it did in the books she obv considered killing tywin already  as we saw from the whole knifeneck sequence  so she didnt think about it at the last minute as she did in the books plus having constant interaction with him and knowing his plots against robb it seems silly that she wouldnt name him and the whole argument that she was safe under tywin makes little sense since a she did name him just too late and b  she thought about killing him herself so obv this wasnt a major concern for her add that to the facts that she is younger and has more pressing concerns in the book eg daily ass kicking from weese she never interacts with tywin and is not privy to his plots yet she still tries to name him  albeit too late  but still the show never gives a concise reason why she waited so long so this plot failure makes her seem much less clever on the show than in the books say what you will about the fact that she waited in the books but im not buying it  esp since she clearly thought about killing tywin  and she clearly wanted to kill tywin as evidenced by the late naming of him therefore failure to name him sooner is a mark against her in the show2  she effectively plans a coup she can foresee that freeing the northmen will mean that robbs men will overtake harrenhal from the lannisters the failure to use any name to effect any change outside of her own situation makes her seem less mature  in the books she considers the fact that there are enough northmen to overtake amorys men  and just needs help with the execution  so she effectively plans a coup  though the logistics are handled by jaqen this is the important part of weasel soup to her development  she is finally bright enough to realize consequences and strategize to achieve her goals in the show she merely uses the last name for her own benefit showing her to be not only helpless but also showing no growth in her time at harrenhal her realization that tywin would have been the smart name starts her on a path to realizing that she needs to do more to help  maybe this can still be achieved in the show since she leaves right after the naming instead of sticking around harrenhal under roose 3 she is clever enough to plan and execute her own escape that in and of itself is a big deal it shows her development from helpless child to mature adult with the free the northmen plan being a sort of transition from one to the otherthe way she used her last name to get help  it seemed strange for one thing as i went on about at length earlier in this thread plus it makes her helpless whereas in the books she not only plans the escape she executes is and a guard those three things are pivotal to her development4 kills in cold bloodshe deliberately kills a guard who has done her no harm  this is the single most important part of her growth at harrenhal in terms of her path to being a fm this can still happen but at this point in the show she does not have the development or the personal hardship required to be so coldblooded beat downs by weese killing several men intentionally as selfdefense general sense of fear at harrenhalso all in all as much as i lamented the deletion of weasel soup and its importance i think that the important part of weasel soup was the plan to free northmen knowing that they would be able to take over the castle since they didnt have the whole northmen sub plot a major growth opportunity is lost that they havent substituted as of yet the only other point of weasel soup is to show the way she tricked jaqen into helping and how much of a bamf jaqen truly is  both of those two things are accomplished in the show however the loss of her maturity in realizing she has to use the third name to effect real change and planning the coup is the real loss to her development the fact that it is substituted with jaqen helping her escape means that those things are lost along with two of her most important developments at harrenhal  being independent and clever enough to figure out how to escape on her own and intentionally killing a guard the epic fails of her storyline this season imocan they bring it back and effect her development in other ways next year probably but the fact remains that at this point in the books she is well on her way to becoming a fm and that is why jaqen gives her the coin edited by summerstark 23 may 2012  0606 pm"

"MaJose",2012-05-21,"no weaselsoup ok so she did name jaqen as her last name wich is cool but the weasel soup plan is so much awesome not only because of the way they did it but also because thanks to arya harrenhal was taken by the north the news of bran and rickons supposed death not reaching the starks way to make robb and catelyn seem completely incompetent they are fitting a freaking war and they go and make all this stupid desicions at least in the book they had the excuse of being emotionally unstable during their screw ups and speaking of screw ups robbs love story is just a mess i though this talissa woman was jeyne westerling in disguise or something but now we had a whole story about her past so is this a completely different character this is making robb seem all the more stupid i guess my vision of robbs wedding was less romantic than the producers i always saw it as robb succumbing to a moment of weakness due to emotional distress jeyne was a high born lady and robb tough he dishonored her by sleeping with her high born ladies are supposed to be virgins when they marry so he marry her it was an honorable decision in a way he just put jeynes honor above his own im not saying he didnt fall in love her im sure there was that too but i always thought that it was his sense of duty and honor that really push him to make that decision and not just love cause he wouldnt be so stupid to ditch the freys just for that but well since we dont have a robb pov i guess this is just me wishful thinking that robb wasnt that stupid"
"House Martell",2012-05-21,"im going to hang on to some shreds of hope and try to rationalize some of the changes without riverrun they can change jenye and eliminate all the westerlings from the show save time and actors i mean without riverrun how can they have her mom and sister part of the story therefore she can be nurse from volantis i agree that they could have given robb some more excuses for falling for her bran  rickon dead him wounded and her caring for him but the door is still open for her to escape with his baby which aside from being the catalyst for the red wedding is her biggest role no weasel soup or coin yet but the last episode is titled valor morgalis so there is hope they include it some how im hoping aryas escape wont be that easy shes had a cake walk of a time so far things have to get harder"

"nothatso",2012-05-21,"i feel like theyve completely destroyed the relationship between jon and qhorin in favor of having jon parade ygritte around in the middle of nowhere that seems like something that had a somewhat significant role not only in his character development but in the perception of the character by readersand potentially viewers now he just kind of looks like an idiot also i was really looking forward to that chase scene from the books where the rangers stay behind one by one to stall rattleshirt but its not going to be there very disappointing edited by nothatso 21 may 2012  0138 am"

"Evamitchelle",2012-05-21,"which is exactly what im looking forward to now i mean really as they have written it it would suggest that discord and weakness was given to them by robb himself given that it was his choice to put cousin alton in the cell with jaime because he has too many live prisoners allowing for his death jaimes initial escape and karstarks sowing discord with threats to behead him for the resulting death of his son leaving catelyn with an impossible decision whilst hes off somewhere made all the worse because he asked volantis to join him in hbogot robb deserves even earns the rw guest right customs or noti do hope they eventually spin it that way showing that robb made one political mistake after another but im worried theyre gonna go with she tricked robb into sleeping with her  instead if talisa does turn out to be jeyne westerling"

"Morvran",2012-05-21,"regarding robb and talisaif they followed the book one episode robb would just show up with a girl he married you think this stuff doesnt fly im not crazy about their scenes in general but if you throw out expectations from the book i can see where the writers are going they want viewers especially nonreaders to be invested in robb before the rw and a love story is the best way to do that if youre not able to finance battle scenes ill admit that as their scene opened last night i picked up my phone and started to play a game i didnt care about her story but then i forced myself to watch bc this was actually a backstory from the book that we never really get i mean the falling for each other not the actual way it happened and i actually ended up liking their scene and shes gorgeousthats ok to say right my one nitpick was that they ended the episode on a complete noncliffhanger we already knew they werent dead they messed the whole branrickon thing up badly you either try to make the viewers believe they killed bran and rickon only to reveal the next week that they didnt which would work or you make it painfully obvious that they didnt really kill them like they did last episode with the pointless scene where bran points out the orphan boys and then end the next episode with a real cliffhanger otherwise i really like this episode"
"Independent George",2012-05-21,"i dont mind the arya changes it changes her character development somewhat but all it really does is push things back a little its still the same basic trajectory the jon changes though its just dumb it makes both qhorin and jon into bumbling idiots i kept holding out hope that there would be a better explanation but it makes no sense for qhorin to leave jon alone with ygritte like that or for them to be taken unawares while searching for the greenhorn they just left alone to execute the prisoner none of it makes sense i was willing hold off judgement until we knew for certain that this is what they were really doing i also agree about both robb and catelyns actions not being driven by grief i just dont understand why they would make that change for dramatic purposes it weakens everyone and they could have told the story just as easily the way it was originally written im hard enough on robb and catelyn in the books this makes their actions so much worse eta heres what i dont get im 100 on board with the changes to danys story as it closes a gaping plot hole from the books which has always bothered me so if the writers were wise enough to do that why would they decide to open up a completely new set of plot holes and character lobotomies in westeros im not a purist  i like a great many of the changes theyve made but i dont understand this dumbing down of the characters edited by independent george 21 may 2012  0827 am"

"Raksha the Demon",2012-05-21,"the weasel soup is fundamentally silly all i remember about it was that they poured it on some people and then slaughter happened the basic idea behind the scene girl is greedy is what they needed to get down obviously they didnt that either but people must get what is at the heart of a scene rather than just what was presented the first time around the jeyne changes are to make us give a shit you can argue if its executed well but the original story was lame robb finds girl after she heals him robb falls in love i seriously had no reason to care for jeyne in the books no real position on her place in society and no reason to care about robbs decision as it related to himself but rather how it related to the rest of the north if you just did that and off screen no less it would be the most boring story in the entire tv showi think that grrm put the robbjeyne love story offscreen because to him robb was not one of the most important characters in asoiaf and jeyne westerling though influential through robbs interaction with her was not particularly important either personally i think robbs sowing the seeds of his own doom and that of his mother and many retainers and bannermen as well for an attractive but not outstanding young thing just because he was an honorable man is ironic and interesting the relationship could have been explored much in the book not as a pulsepounding great love affair ie the young wolf the king in the north falling for a fascinating strongwilled charismatic girl but as something more human and believable  the king in the north revealed as a troubled boy turning to this pleasant young girl who he likes but does not love for comfort when he is injured and if i remember right saddened by his brothers death and then having to decide how to best uphold stark honor  to keep his betrothal to the unknown frey girl or cleave to the young girl who he has just dishonored i would have found such a storyline in the tv series far more believable than the much too modern romance of robb and talisathefeistynursei didnt miss the weasel soup episode either i did miss arya killing the guard or was he a groom i cant remember it was another milestone in her transformation from ned starks honorable child to a callous killer"

"bikie",2012-05-22,"just think the show has been dumbed down beyond recognition the motivations of cat and robb are weak and uninspired without them hearing about bran and rickon osha stealing food in the middle of the day is just lazy writing and utter lack of creativity jon is now the 4th stooge arya lack of violence and role changing stilts her character and makes her much less interesting the actress playing her has made hbo arya who she is with no help from the creative staff danys scenes could basically just be shot in one take and replayed for each episode she is to appear in robb and talisa is boring cliche and filler for a character robb who i thought they started to develop in an impressive way im sticking with the show but am very disappointed with the direction it has taken this season"
"teemo",2012-05-22,"it sucks how sansa a pov character is getting hardly any time whatsoever even if you dont like sansa its totally possible to appreciate her povs considering she was one of our only inside sources at kl that wasnt a lannister her povs were always extremely insightful and i love sansa regardless of all the hate she gets on here"
"Rapsie",2012-05-22,"also the conversations between sandor and sansa were essential character building for both characters and their motivations in later books given the tywin  arya scenes we will hopefully get the sandor character building next season sansa might be a bit more difficult as she made a point of not interacting with tyrion"
"teemo",2012-05-22,"they could have easily fit in some sansan last episode completely take out robb and talisas scene okay like 75 of it and danys scene and there would have been plenty of time to build up more a relationship between the two or at least sansa or something with sansa"
"Buckwheat",2012-05-22,"i actually really liked this part  the scene still resonated with me it seems like something hed have said to robb tooyes he might but i hated it i missed the line in the conversation between brandon and eddard at the execution of gared will but i can live with it if they did not put the line there for brandon to hear it surely the volantene could have lived without it tooapparently i am alone in this though shrug"

"RSasoiaf",2012-05-23,"very true i think all of the things that you point out stem from two factors 1 they overly condensed the story for season 2 they picked and chose scenes without really figuring out what abandoned scenes were significant to the ones they kept in book 2 needed to be more than ten episodes or they could have cut major plots they would have been better off leaving stannis out entirelyjust an example than cutting pieces from each storyline 2 the showrunners are good at making scenes but bad at making consistent characters and plotlines they find scenes in the book that they want to do or write new ones and man are the effective but they dont spend much time on working the plot so the scene makes sense in context this means inconsistent character motivation leading to many of the problems you brought upagreemy own speculation is that this may be something to do with them working with different sets and different people writting each episode i fear we currently lack someone with an overall view and a mastermind plan to really cut this here and change that there this was likely not such a big problem on s1 because they were only doing small changes which were mainly local and had no big impact on the whole story now that they start changing things which may have an impact further ahead we start seing that most of these changes work in someway if we consider the individual scenes but they dont seem to get together into the big picturethe one with joff and the whores is quite an example someone decided to build a hell of a subplot and they did create an agressive and effective scene there but then they seem to leave behind what looked to be the big point about that scene unfortunatelly the big point behind that scene has no place so far in the story so what was the ideai could really enjoy seing some of these ideas go forward i would not have a problem with it but they need to keep to some of them and really work them out into a big story else they get something where we are constantly thrown in different directions with many of them just going nowhere insert arya and tywin that like many said were amazingly well made scenes but they just do nothing in terms of general plot"

"Rickon is FIERCE",2012-05-23,"ghost being awol is a bit of a sticky wicket because iirc jon was very deliberate when commanding him to lay in between he and ygritte which would have played just as funny and believably for hbo ghost suddenly showing up now would simply appearoddadditionally hborobb let slip that his bannermen have been griping about talisa caring for prisonersenemies which pretty much confirms that her behavior in most every circle is considered unacceptable his response i tell them they are not your enemies nevermind the obvious wtf looks roose manages whenever she interrupts by just walking in and how is it exactly that some solder can attempt to enter catelyns tent and be rebuffed without a seconds passing but talisa just up and presents herself unannounced and apparently unaware of how unacceptable such behavior will be viewed the telling difference is that brienne emphasized that one must ask to enter and be heard so if talisa doesnt have to observe the same custom perhaps robb has already commanded that she be allowed to enter at her will which would effectively nullify the i dont have to keep my vow at the expense of my happiness mo that dd are selling it becomes premeditated by him acted on by him and eventually consummated by him the first two prior to catelyns betrayalreally like this postlot of my same thoughtsonly id forgotten that detail about jon using ghost to keep things from gettin freaky with ygritte youre right it would have played well on tv and then we could still get that classic line from ygritte after she tells the world she and jon have been gettin it on many a night when she says have ghost sleep somewhere else tonight"

"RobertOfTheHouseBaratheon",2012-05-24,"tywin keeps repeatingly stating that robb keeps winning battles but his army has sat in the westerlands all season not doing anything they are not even pillaging and burning the westerlands it was my understanding robb was dealing out the same card tywin dealt to the riverlands in an attempt to draw him back there robb was stated as winning 3 battles at the beggining of the series thats whispering wood the follow up battle and one mystery battle then he beat stefford lannister thats 4 victories i dont need to see countless battles or capturing of villagesforts id just like when tywin mentions his victories he name checks a recent one maybe kevin will remark scouts tell us robb has captured the fort at bambury or something like that then have tywin rant about the great boy king im just annoyed they havent been clearer about the movement of armies they havent properly explained why tywin in at harrenhall hes there because from that position he can march south to defend kl and still keep robb from moving south and linking up with renlystannis weve had plenty of scenes with tywin planning war what would it take one minute to have them describe the situation and position of the major players that scene with stannis in ep01 with that glorious table they should have used the table and had one of his men maybe even davos describe where everyone was describe robbs victories and where tywin was and why it would have reminded non book fans exactly what happened in s1 and what the situation was in the war that would have been a great way to open the series imo it all just feels like theres not enough info for nonbook readers to follow and book readers are made to have it all suffer unecessary changes the robb love story i wont say too much about except i think they didnt want robb to be acting out of grief or honour they wanted love to be the motivator for him maybe they thought it would be more acceptable in this twilight time to have a tragic love story than have an audience think about the complicated motivations we get from the books i think its a shame that they werent brave enough to let the story stand out for itself than remodel it for the twilight generation edited by robertofthehousebaratheon 25 may 2012  0324 am"

"Mulled Wino",2012-05-21,"they left and came back in the books too i agree with the poster that wanted to know how they avoided the horses for a whole day remember theres only like 20 ironborn in th whole castle"
"The Meeraculous Third Reed",2012-05-21,"the whole luwin seeing osha as she sneaked back into the crypts scene was cringe worthy"
"Jolene Brown",2012-05-21,"did they leave and come back i thought they sent the dogs out to make a fake trail"
"Buttered Turnip",2012-05-21,"as a book reader it didnt bother me because as i remember this is what happened in the booksthey left and then backtracked through the stream the only difference is that when i read the books i imagined that they left winterfell and backtracked that same night and were already in the crypts when theon and reek went searching for them"

"Faraday",2012-05-21,"the whole luwin seeing osha as she sneaked back into the crypts scene was cringe worthyyeah fucking hell thered be absolutely no reason for her to sneak out in the middle of the day to steal food it was a pretty contrived way of having luwin figure out what happened ew"
"Jolene Brown",2012-05-21,"its also a little annoying because in the books luwin knew the bodies werent bran and rickon i liked that he wasnt fooled although it did make one question why he didnt send a raven to cat and robb to share that with them"
"SerMixalot",2012-05-21,"umm did luwin know in the books that the bodies werent all that were left were flayed heads dipped in tar i thought he was suprised when the found him dying in the greatwood"
"CrypticWeirwood",2012-05-21,"no luwin knew he saw the legs none were atrophies from disuse as branâ<U+0080><U+0099>s would have been"
"turdle",2012-05-21,"the issue for me is that in the book they both leave and return before they are suspected of being gone but in the tv show we see that they are still out and about after its been discovered that they are gone seems like it would be near impossible to get back without being spotted but whatever"
"Hear Us Roar",2012-05-21,"we did not need to see it already enough needless stuff in this ep bran knows that castle like the back of his hand theon also snuck because he knows the castle well the bran storyline is a bore at this moment they need to keep him off screen until the dreadfort men show up which is like season 3 more time for stannis and kings landing scenes"
"Hear Us Roar",2012-05-21,"umm did luwin know in the books that the bodies werent all that were left were flayed heads dipped in tar i thought he was suprised when the found him dying in the greatwoodin the books the bodies were tarred and feathered for posterity so the legs could be seen in the show they were burnt so luwin would not be able to figure it out"
"Mad Queen",2012-05-21,"i was so happy they are hiding in the crypts im willing to forgive anything winkpng classbbcemoticon alt  i thought they wouldnt and i really want to see them leave the crypts to find winterfell burned and maester luwin dying"

"SerMixalot",2012-05-21,"again all in all i think the writers did a great job on the winterfell storyline throughout the season"
"Magjee",2012-05-22,"the whole luwin seeing osha as she sneaked back into the crypts scene was cringe worthyin the middle of the day no less while theon is in the courtyardat least be sneaky about sneaking"
"Mulled Wino",2012-05-22,"again all in all i think the writers did a great job on the winterfell storyline throughout the seasoni totally agree look they need to have leuwin around later on to take rickon and if they have to throw in a questionable scene to keep that guy around im all for it it didnt mess up the integrity of the story at all imo and like someone already said as long as they got back to the crypts im all good"
"TeamDanyArya",2012-05-24,"i just figured they slipped back in at night even if the place is guarded guards fall asleep at some point we dont need to be spoonfed that best to leave it up to the imagination of how they got back in"
"sennahoj",2012-05-24,"when i saw them on the run in the episode before i thougt the hiding in the crypts bit was cut i can understand why they were shown near the farm so at least some viewers were fooled about the identitiy of the corpses but i didnt find it logical to be on the run with the wolves and then turn back sneak back into the castle and not be caught but then hey osha is a wildling she can probably do anything"
"CrypticWeirwood",2012-05-24,"remember that bran knows the secret passageways in winterfellâ<U+0080><U+0099>s walls"
"protar",2012-05-24,"this change makes me think that they might be postponing the sack of winterfell until s3 simply because i cant see any other reason why they wouldnt leave the reveal of bran and rickon until then itd make a great twist for the season finale whereas here it fell rather flat but that would be explained if it wouldve meant waiting a year for the reveal"
"High_Heart_Hag",2012-05-24,"its also a little annoying because in the books luwin knew the bodies werent bran and rickon i liked that he wasnt fooled although it did make one question why he didnt send a raven to cat and robb to share that with themof course luwin didnt send word to robb and catelyn theon killed the ravens  and took all the horses couldnt help but laugh a little at how pitiful it all soundedmy biggest concern was how well nonbook readers would grasp that osha and kids were hiding in the crypts its the first time theyve been shown since last season cringeworthy all around but having luwin find them lends credence to the theory that he may take oshas place with rickon after winterfells sacked of course if skagos is another red herring who needs the old man past season 2"
"madman2711",2012-05-24,"i would vision the last part of winterfell story in ep 10 like theon gets word if an aproaching northmen army and that he is surrounded and luwin gets his take the black speach theon then push him to the ground and raises his sword cut to later scene when bran wargs summer into winterfell burning and deserted then they exit the crypts and they find the agonising luwin that instructs them to find the reeds  go to skagos or something similar edited by madman2711 24 may 2012  1139 am"

"victim",2012-05-21,"i noticed he got a good mention by cersei in the tyrionros scene and after it i was expecting to see him a little bit more to set up the character before next episode we didnt though and now it seems to be little more than a reference to a character currently being played by a featured extra so how should his betrayal of tyrion unfold in next weeks episode well chances are it wont and i can recall someone suggesting meryn trant should take his place which seems like a good enough idea  audiences have already seen him being a lacklustre guardsmen who follows cersei and joffrey unquestionably while also having a general dislike for tyrion so this idea makes sense and is helped by the fact that audiences probably already dislike the fellow yet the mention had to be for some reason outside of adding a little bit to the world cersei could have said ser arys or ser boros to get audiences more familiar with characters who become important later so im thinking that perhaps moore has been cast for a kind of oneepisode arc where he is told it is his duty to protect tyrion only to betray him for cersei i cant see any other point of him being mentioned outside of this and its in many small ways similar to mentioning the bastard of bolton what we do know however is how vital that scene is to tyrions storyline so im pretty sure its going to happen as in im not expecting him to run into battle only be accidentally knocked unconscious again i guess it all depends on how much exposition at kings landing we get before the actual battle begins"

"Mummer's wind",2012-05-14,"its kind of the whole point in my opinion tyrion saves the city from stanniss armies and prevents cerseis burning it down through poor planning then nobody recognizes his contributions even though he saved the lives of possibly most of the city then they remove him from power and everyone hates him im sure i really hope they can show that tyrions planning saves the day in this season ill be slightly disappointed if we dont see the massive pile of burning ships though and the horror on davoss face when he realizes that theyve just sailed right into a nightmare"

"celery",2012-05-14,"anyone else wondering what tyrion tells cersei shell pay for in the preview alayaya isnt in the show and i dont understand how she could have found out about shaecersei could have found out about shae from the other handmaid she threatened in the last episode from sansas flowering scene i think it was a pretty stupid move on shaes part seeing as she doesnt have any little birds or any spies of her own to uphold the threat it would be easy for the maid to run and tell cersei shae really cant do anything to stop her so all shes done is just cast suspicion on herselfstill i think its a possibility that the added character ros will take alayayas place thoughwhat im personally most concerned about at the moment is jons storyline i think its crucial that he join the wildings on qhorins orders if he forsakes any vows without being commanded to it would severely change the character imo so i am a bit worried but im assuming hoping that jon is rescued by ghost andor qhorin and the other black brothers in this episode or next giving the story a chance to play out as it did in the book this way the small divergence would only help make it a more reasonable choice for qhorin to choose jon to join them i suppose by making it look more likely from the wilding perspective that jon would betray the nw"
"Lexicdark",2012-05-14,"well from the preview it looked like the wildings have some of the black brothers jon was traveling with even possibly qhorin so they might bring it back around making it qhorin who tells jon to do whatever it takes to gain the trust of the wildings and get that information back to the wall but i agree with the rest if they dont do that and jon just picks that solution total deviation from character especially after all that rambling on about his vows while wandering around with yigrette"

"LordofWinter",2012-05-15,"just my 02i know a lot of folks are stressing about the changes from the books and what not but if you look back through the old threads dd were on here gathering opinions from fans long before they began to film or probably even write the script i think they truly care about what we thinkthis is my biggest problem with the show and i know ill be labelled a book purist but i think that most of the small changes are due to the writers of the show putting too much stock in the views and opinions of the people on these boards ive only been on here a few weeks but ive been able to tell what alot of the hot button issues are with the fans of the series certain things have fans split down the middle as far as opinions go while some just seem to be more extreme cases of fandom but i could see myself being a writer for this show and also being a member of this site and thinking hey you know what i totally agree with what qci said im sure if i write it this way i can show that cersei isnt so bad compared to characters like robertjoffrey or apple martini is right catelyn does get a bad rap a few simple changes will show she had the best intentions or i dont trust margery i think shes just as schemey or more so than cersei lets add this and while they change and add things like some kind of a renegade chef messing with a perfectly good recipe we the fans of the books who look forward to an adaptation of those books into a great show tend to get instead some writers idea a how they think they could improve upon the books that were written for instance lets make jeyne westerling a sexy spy who wins robbs heart dispite the war hes fighting instead of some poor maid whos town he sacks and then box he claims thats much more believable and easier to explain in ten episodes edit this is a work of fiction any resemblance of names or locations is strictly coincidental and was not intended the author and this website do not claim to have a direct answer as to the feelings of any of the members of this site in regards to charactersplotlines in the book series also the author does not claim to know what goes on in the heads of the writing staff of a major television show nor does he claim to have proof that they spend their time trolling fansites of book series their life is probably already consumed with im thinking roz will have some unfortunate event happen to which tyrion will be very upset and the audience will get the opportunity to understand the depth of his character of course once we get to adwd we will be even more heartbroken to see his character take a turn for the worse at least for a whilehow they plan to make people believe that tyrion gives two shits about ros i have no idea especially since i dont think theyve met even at this point in the show so this seems like a poor choice in change there is already too much confusion going on with the whole sansashae thing most people i know who didnt read the books were confused when sansa went directly from not liking or trusting shae to all of a sudden trusting her not to mention the sheer lunacy of shae working in the castle so to just throw ros in the mix will make sense to readers who saw the lack of any other option presented but will have the watchers only crowd wondering how the two are connected"

"Tewks44",2012-05-15,"with some of the recent dumb changes made throughout this season im really really worried about the house of the undying i have a feeling they will completely take the visions out i may be done with the show if they do thatalso im really hoping that we still get qhorins and jons escape the eagle following them and the speech and duel between them that was one of the more epic moments in the second bookand did jon and arya really have the wolfdreams in the second book i thought those came way later as compared to bransi believe jon had his first and only if im not mistaken full warging wolf dream in book 2 when he scouted the wilding army in ghosts bodyand in terms of ramsay i think hes just going to show up and be like im here to retake the castle and then hell basically convince theon to surrender and then ramsay will basically demolish winterfell anyway that way they can work him into the story without being too confusing for the viewers who havent read the books but we still learn that ramsay is a totally twisted dude and were in the same place as the books at that point in terms of ramsaytheons story"

"imajication",2012-05-16,"re not having the chain people are complaining that if they dont have the chain it will diminish tyrions contribution to the battle of blackwater but remember that in the scene where they introduced the wildfire bronn made a big deal about wildfire not being good to use in actual combat because the people using it would end up dropping it causing the side using wildfire more harm that good i think tyrions contribution will be the insight to just stick the wildfire in the derelicts and set blackwater bay on fire using them as cercie had planned would have been disastrous at least in the universe of the tv show but tyrion will have figured out how to use wildfire correctly im not so happy about stannis giving davos the command of his fleet in the book it was implied than davos would have been much more cautious than the actual commander at blackwater having davos in command will make him seem less competent and then stannis making him hand will seem more insane also davos isnt even a lord yet in westeros it just seem weird to give a simple knight command of a fleet at least make hime a lord first"
"StarkWard",2012-05-16,"im not so happy about stannis giving davos the command of his fleet in the book it was implied than davos would have been much more cautious than the actual commander at blackwater having davos in command will make him seem less competent and then stannis making him hand will seem more insaneits not too late to revert to the original identity of the commander as davos said the lords will not be pleased if a former smuggler were to lead them so theres still a possibility of the lords overriding his commands at sea"

"mmp",2012-05-16,"im not 100 satisfied with season 2 but when i think about it book 2 was my least favorite season 2 is so far a better watch than book 2 was a read hbo is making a lot out of some pretty dry material mellisandre is cool when she pops out the demon theon and davos are cool everyone else is a bore dany jon catelyn tyrion will be cool if the battle on the blackwater is a lengthy sequence is it the full episode the episode spoiler suggests it is and shows him charging through the fiery battlefield forget the golden chain just put him on a horse and rally the troops helms deep style seasons 3 and 4 will be awesome because book 3 is awesome like book 1 book 3 has a lot of memorable scenes at least at the house of the undying we might get a first mention of rhaegar  prophecy if they throw it all out then danys story arc this season will have been terribly unimportant but thats book 2 not much happens for dany relative to the other characters im glad they went to iceland there just isnt any mythicality in the acting alone edited by mmp 16 may 2012  0757 pm"
"Khal-a-bunga",2012-05-16,"how much has jons storyline really changed from the preview for this episode it looks like well be seeing qhorin and jon together again and im sure theyll have dialogue together similar to what was in the books the story for jon this season in my eyes has very ably portrayed an inner struggle hes feeling about being a member of the nights watch the issue with craster and the white walkers led jon to realize that mormont knows what kind of man craster is which is important because it makes jon question the integrity of their goal mormont knows craster is a shitheel who sacrifices his sons but its a necessary evil in his opinion the expanded time with ygritte further breaks down jons unquestioning loyalty as she makes a lot of good points about the nature of freedom and the validity of the oath he decided to take i understand that you want more time with qhorin and his men but to what purpose ygritte remains integral to jons storyline going forward qhorin is a catalyst although a wonderful character in his own rite for that story to happen its more important for an audience to get a sense of her character than it is for them to spend more time with qhorin id say and besides we know for a fact that hell be in at least two more episodes this season so we should probably expect that hell be further developed and that hell still force jon to kill him in that case the a remained the same and the c remains the same so all dd have really done is adapt the b to work better as a television series i just dont see how you can say theyve made any massive narrative altering changes to jons storyline or anyones to be honest when thats clearly not the case not to mention there are still three episodes left this season i understand youre approaching this from the perspective of a purist but even so saying anything has been substantially changed to this point is pure hyperbole i think ill defer to david dan bryan cogman and  oh yeah  the author of the novels themselves rather than worry about inconsequential details being changed or omitted or shuffled around"

"gogorath",2012-05-16,"i think the sore point for a lot of people is how well season 1 was apdapted there was no reason for that not to continue not being uber wordforword faithful but the clearly understood the important points of each storyline but this season its as if the praise they got for such scenes as the robertcersi conversation for example has gone to their headsis there not a clash of kings is a harder adaptation game of thrones lent itself very well to 10 episodes clash added three major net locations stannis harrenhal  the iron islands it added a ton of characters stannis melisandre davos yaraasha balon xaro pyat pree quaithe ygritte jeyne roose qhorin margaery along with an increased role for renly and sandor and tywin though thats an adaptation choiceso the scope of the story  already epic in scale  just got much larger now factor in the blackwater the preproduction and production time of that spending an entire episode in one location i think its very unfair to claim changes are due to the writers egos why not try to see it their way before making such an accusationnow thisfor me  tyrion arya and theon all enjoyed their best arcs in clash of kings so it was important they get their storylines correct and as full as possible for this season then other characters can take the spotlight next yearand thisjon snow has gotten the right amount of screen time this year but only if they stick to the key points of his narrative they done tyrion justice but pherhaps bodged theons with the kills of bran and rickon  far too heavy handed no one thinks theyre dead ayra at harrenhal yes tywin is great but there plenty of oppotunity to see him next season they should have rolled the best bits of their 3 scenes together into one decent sized scene because of tywinsayras fatherdaughter relationship harrenhal has lost all its terror whos gonnna touch tywins lannisters cup bearer and all the power of ayra surving the kitchens and using her 3 kills has been lost and the second kill and what lead up to it was imbasilicthose two statements are wildly inconsistent to me jons story plot points have changed but i bet in the end all weve lost is the wolf dream and what weve gained is more time with ygritte more background on why he might abandon his commitments these things are vital to jon snows journey from emo minined stark to the man we see in adwdyou admit tyrion has been done well although i dont know how your request that we focus on these three people is consistent with a more faithful adaptation and arya  i still find her story to be about empowerment perhaps were just seeing it differently but i dont think shes particularly safe just the physical beatings of weese being replaced by the constant fear of discovery i suppose i could see your point of view  except for the idea that what they did is imbecilic i actually enjoyed that  one it makes sense as to how she wastes her kill and two i dont mind a bit of humor its missing from too many dramaswell it matters because how will you feel if when they get to the next book when the storm of swords storyline takes hold and they change all the cool stuff there too sure the characters may again end up in the correct place ready for the next book where yet again perhaps the details are changed again in that season tooand this is what i dont get what is the cool stuff you are referring to jons storyline is going to be really close just with a few things added arya  so weese isnt beating her its not like they removed jaqen or something so yes i would mind if say dracarys was completely different next year but honestly this is more like daario naaharis showing up at astapor instead of yunkai theres bound to be a lot more changes but so far i havent seen anything ruined as people as wont to say characters motivations are still intact even with differences in actions or how we see them the story arcs are still thereand frankly while yours and my favorite scenes at times have changed a bit  a line here an element there  most of the established mustnail sequences have been very good and pretty darn faithful one last aside i know quite a few watchers who are unsure about bran and rickon i agree that i wouldnt have been so obvious but while it was a bit heavy handed its also hard for me to anticipate the problems on the other end if you dont telegraph it enough on the other side people are frustrated when they are revealed as not realistic"

"Chelly",2012-05-17,"just curiious why you think its going to be someone other than shae who gets whippedisnt that what happens in the book alayaya is mistaken for tyrions love interest and cersei has her beaten i guess the show doesnt have to follow it though"

"flinky",2012-05-17,"the way i see it all the chain could just be mentioned between tyrion and bronn when ashayara comes to theon she may have prisoners with her from rodrik cassels group who were the ones who captured reek and have him along with them then leaves with cleftjaw and others leaving theon almost alone there robb being betrayed could be that he finds out about westerling and that is when they hook upget married he also finds out about bran and rickon this makes the freys and karstarks leave jon could still be shown warging with ghost walking around while he sleeps at the wildling camp arya doesnt get to use her last kill and it is saved until the last episode where she could use it to get the northerners out of the cells idk either way i like how it is turning out"

"boojam",2012-05-18,"i disagree the hotu would be an incredibly dramatic end to danys arc ending it in slavers bay would fall flat in comparison and would feel disjointed from danys story in qarth plus it means a new set a new cast etc just for the last episode which is a bit of a waste considering that at the time of filming there wouldnt have been any guarantee that the show would be renewed leaving danys story in slavers bay wouldnt be the logical conclusion itd feel like theyd started a new chapter in her arc and just left it hanging not to mention the fact that dracarys as the s3 finale would make excellent tv but isnt going to work pacingwise if part of danys sos arc is moved into s2i wondered about this from the perspective of ending each season on dragonsas they did in season onei would still think that e10 takes it title from arya and jaqens parting but that need only be short and could even include aryas escapethen s3 could end on dracarys i am thinking the stuff dampd will move to the end of s2 from sos is some of the brienne and jamie stuff after all gwendoline christie has had very little air timeyou know having just finished sos reread my personal favorite story line is aryas  it a ripping yarn of a survival story and the travels with the dog are matchlesswhich includes a certain event the name of which will not be spokenthe briennejamie story sort of parallels aryas if a totally different way but its another zinger of an action storysecond is dany well i am a dany fan lord danys story takes off like alexander the great on steroids after dracrys since  war wise things calm down so much in westeros my druthers would be  for s4 if we get it the conquest of yunkai the conquest of meereen tho that one is almost told as a flashback could be reworked a hell of a lot goes on with dany in sos that is very action stuff but me thinks that runs straight into budget problemsthen there is a lot  a lot of action beyond the wall and at castle blackthere is enough vim and turmoil a plenty for two seasons one again grrm travelogs would vanishthere is so blasted much in sos that  seems to me moving stuff from foc and adwd would be a squeezeif things get that far  what to do with foc and adwd dampd have good imaginations so maybe an unexpected fixup is at hand edited by boojam 18 may 2012  0429 pm"

"Kevin79",2012-05-18,"in i wondered about this from the perspective of ending each season on dragons as they did in season one i would still think that e10 takes it title from arya and jaqens parting but that need only be short and could even include aryas escape then s3 could end on dracarys i am thinking the stuff dampd will move to the end of s2 from sos is some of the brienne and jamie stuff after all gwendoline christie has had very little air time you know having just finished sos reread my personal favorite story line is aryas  it a ripping yarn of a survival story and the travels with the dog are matchless which includes a certain event the name of which will not be spoken the briennejamie story sort of parallels aryas if a totally different way but its another zinger of an action story second is dany well i am a dany fan lord danys story takes off like alexander the great on steroids after dracrys since  war wise things calm down so much in westeros my druthers would be  for s4 if we get it the conquest of yunkai the conquest of meereen tho that one is almost told as a flashback could be reworked a hell of a lot goes on with dany in sos that is very action stuff but me thinks that runs straight into budget problems then there is a lot  a lot of action beyond the wall and at castle black there is enough vim and turmoil a plenty for two seasons one again grrm travelogs would vanish there is so blasted much in sos that  seems to me moving stuff from foc and adwd would be a squeeze if things get that far  what to do with foc and adwd dampd have good imaginations so maybe an unexpected fixup is at handjudging from the way they foreshadowed the three horn blasts earlier in the season im willing to bet that this season ends with the attack on the fist of the first men and what an incredible ending to the season that would be id rather it ends this season than starts the third for sure as we havent had a really good look at white walkers since the first episode and the tv audience needs to be shown how large of a threat they actually are last season ended with fire its only logical that this season has to end with ice right my only gripe is that they will definitely cut the fist attack short and probably cut to black with the nights watch seeing a legion of blue eyed warriors storming them after the third horn blast but i fully expect it to occur this season anyway as it would be the best note to end on"

"King Tommen",2012-05-19,"long time lurker but i did want to add my two cents to the dagmerramsay theory i would agree that the largest issue is the age discrepancy unless either were supposed to believe the actor playing roose is far older than he is or that dagmer is much younger than he appears putting this one hiccup aside though i think this is by far the most logical explanation of how the ramsay snow character will be introduced in this season one of the problems book readers are having with the characterization is the presence of dagmer in pyke and that he would have had to pose as an ironborn for some time to infiltrate the crew i would suggest that book readers are having problems with this because they have preconceived notions about the dagmer character who is similar to the novels dagmer cleftjaw in name only on the show he is not a legendary ironborn warrior who theon knew as a child and he doesnt appear to be acknowledged by anyone on pyke outside of theon in fact the show has taken pains to demonstrate that no one from pyke interacts with dagmer outside of theon he only appears and introduces himself to theon after theons crew has left for the ship and yara has departed after dressing down theon he introduces himself as 1st mate which theon accepts at face value and you could argue that by arriving at the ship with theon the other ironborn men could accept as well since they dont appear to know much about the battleplans and strategy that theon attempts to lay out for them there could just be an assumption that theon brought along his own 1st mate it is curious that in winterfell dagmer doesnt even acknowledge the other ironborn crewmembers and interacts only with theon if you subscribe to this storyline you would also have to accept that roose put ramsay into play as soon as he knew theon was headed back to pyke to treat with his father something roose would have been privy to as one of robbs senior bannermen perhaps he anticipated theon being cajoled by his father and wanted ramsay there in order to give theon the nudge he needed to try and take winterfell and in the introduction scene dagmer is clearly pointing theon in the direction of winterfell by appealing to his need for acceptance with his father and his crew he even guides theon to the point where he can make it look like taking winterfell is his own idea add to the fact that dagmer has been provided all of the reek storyline beats to encourage theon down the road that he takes in winterfell burning the boys executing the disrespectful winterfell loyalist etc and he appears to be taking more than a little bit of pleasure than what would be expected from these actions finally the fact that ramsay has not been cast this season but is clearly going to be on the show after being mentioned by roose means that it would be next to impossible to execute the razing of winterfell plot point in the final episode without ramsay being someone already on the show with rodrick already dead and presumably no winterfell forces attempting to retake the gates it is difficult to fathom how any kind of betrayal will be portrayed once the dreadfort forces arrive and it would be awfully strange to have a masked unspeaking extra playing ramsay this season as it would be terribly confusing for the audience to complete a razing of winterfell without some kind of deception that would require a certain amount of conversation with theon in order to convey what exactly is going on dagmer revealing himself at this point after allowing ramsays forces into winterfell either secretly or through some contrived deception would be a far easier way to demonstrate that theon has been duped from the getgo no one in the audience will understand the motivations of the boltons who arrive if there isnt some kind of inside man alfie allen in a recent interview stated how excited he was about how a certain huge scene came off in the final episode which he specifically mentioned the dagmer actor being involved with him this could be referencing a number of things but certainly the drama involved with the dagmer deception being finally revealed would be a great scene for the two of them i guess there could be some quibbles with the fact that in this scenario roose is playing an extremely long game which wasnt as clear in the books and having ramsay being sent to pyke could be seen as a little convuluted but is it really any more convuluted as ramsay switching identities with his torture pet getting captured going to winterfell befriending theon and quickly becoming his trusted confidant before turning on him and burning down the city which seems patently ridiculous and confusing when laid out this way probably why dd made the changes they did well see how this works out soon enough but i think even the most ardent denier of this scenario would have to admit that everything is pointing to dagmer being a part of the bolton plot at the very least in league with rooseramsay and will probably have a major role to play in theons arc past this season edited by king tommen 19 may 2012  0212 pm"

"Khal-a-bunga",2012-05-19,"the whole dagmer being ramsay thing is a joke right i mean common sense alone rules out that theory with just a cursory glance so it has to be an elaborate joke i refuse to believe anyone thinks this theory is actually credible anyway since a lot of people are discussing how the season should end i copied a post of mine from the general got forum im hoping the final scenes of the second season are in this order dany jorah barristan and everyone else sailing away from qarth while the dragons fly above them then the three horn blasts which fades to black similar to last season after the fade to black well get a cool shot of a ray of light penetrating the darkness as the door to the crypts open and bran rickon  company emerge and have their conversation with maester luwin similar to last season where episode nine was very much the culmination of the season and the finale worked more to set up the story going forward jon and dany both have fantastic arcs in a song of swords so it makes sense to have material from essos and north of the wall close out the season with the more uplifting sort of scene at winterfell to end it edited by khalabunga 19 may 2012  0310 pm"
"House Snow",2012-05-19,"great post king tommen maybe we are wrong but i think the deniers are being awfully unfair to the people supporting this theory at the fvery least there is a ton of circumstantial evidence also roose really only has to be 1415 year older than ramsey as it is concievable that he had him youngand on the show i can buy that age difference show roose look early to mid 50s while ramsey is in the late 30early 40s age range roose honestly looks at least 10 years older to me and probably more id like to see a picture side by side to compare"

"DragonAge93",2012-05-19,"dagmer and ramsay are two completely different characters i highly doubt theyd do something like youre suggesting roose has confirmed ramsay is at the dreadfort and im pretty sure if his son had moved to the iron islands hed have heard of it dagmers only taking reeks spot most likely because the writers thought itd be better to have an iron islander guiding theon in his decisions rather than a noname prisoner from the dungeons itd be more confusing to the nonbook readers and its easier to have an established ironborn to guide theon ramsay will appear and take over winterfell and his story will continue on from there but what in the picture suggested dagmer is ramsay we just have him standing next to theon nothing spoilery about that"

"Warden of the North121",2012-05-19,"ill also add right ahead of time that yes if by some insanity it turns out that they are making dagmer ramsay it is a horrible horrible idea i dont know why thats supposed to be some kind of irony the reason i dont think it is true is because if true it would be an awful idea its an awful idea to cast a roughly 40 year old actor as the son of another roughly 40 year old actor and its an awful idea to have a twist that doesnt make any logical sense just because theres a different twist in the books that does make sensei agree with this wholeheartedly could it be true perhaps but its unlikely and if it is indeed true its probably the first change that i would regard as being completely stupid and unecessary im almost positive hes in league with the boltons somehow put imo he isnt ramsay"
