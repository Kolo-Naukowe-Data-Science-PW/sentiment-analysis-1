1	Ran	2012-04-08	Book spoiler discussion of the show goes here, for those who want to discuss the episode in relation to the books, and with reference to spoilers from them.
This topic should open automatically when the show is about to finish.
2	legba11	2012-04-08	Wow, the people, who don't like changes, heads just exploded.
3	Katydid	2012-04-08	So wait - JOFFREY ordered the killing of Robert's bastards?
Did I miss something?
4	Baitac	2012-04-08	Yay! Pyke is now on the map!
5	Lannes	2012-04-08	Wow, the people, who don't like changes, heads just exploded.Yes, indeed......this is going to be fun to watch......
6	frametown	2012-04-08	Great episode.  I personally like changes, only because I hate watching something where I know what happens in the end.  
The last scene with Jon is a perfect example of that.   Great cliffhanger ending.
7	dtones520	2012-04-08	Just to get it out there, I think the killing of Rakharo was due to the actors schedule, not the producers wanting to kill off a character who lives through the books.
8	EgoistMusketeer	2012-04-08	So what exactly makes something a battle? /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
9	RandomWanderer	2012-04-08	some of the changes aren't too major.. but jon playing winter woods detective and seeing others ? eh... I dunno lol.
also I liked Sallador as well.. the actor seemed to be able to capture the essence of the character well enough.

10	Mya Stone	2012-04-08	I f-ing loved this episode. LOVED. Bring it, naysayers. Peter and Lena were AMAZING on screen together. I am going to continue to love their scenes, as I think he brings her up about 100 notches.
Loved Davos, loved Sallador. I'm intrigued that we actually saw Stannis be seduced by Melisandre.
Sad about Rahkaro. He was my favorite blood rider. (Hell, he was the only blood rider I knew.)
Pyke was exactly as I pictured it. I mean, freaking perfect. And poor Theon. Yeah, I said it. You can feel how badly he just wants to be accepted by anyone. /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
I'm sure I'm missing a ton, but yeah...this episode really brought it for me.
Oh yeah! Arya/Gendry was heartwarming. And the guy who plays Jaquen I love in the 30 seconds he was on screen.

11	The Last Hero	2012-04-08	I thought the episode was ok, but I'm not a fan of the changes with Cersei or the management of the whole scene with Stannis and Mel. And I had heard the same story about Rakharo.
12	Mad Queen	2012-04-08	So wait - JOFFREY ordered the killing of Robert's bastards?Did I miss something?Book Joffrey would never do that. It would be like Joffrey admitting to himself that he isn't Robert's son, or is there any other reason to order the killing of Robert's bastards?
13	turdle	2012-04-08	ghost looked fantastic, wish they could have spent more time with asha/yara before the reveal, but time is precious. i dont really like that mel and stan are fucking, TMI once again. i did like that we got to see a whitewalker.
14	Spooky Scary Jurble	2012-04-08	Wow, the people, who don't like changes, heads just exploded.MY MONITOR IS COVERED IN SKULL.Issues I had with the episode:1. Asha letting Theon finger her - wat.2. Ayra looks like a Final Fantasy character.3. That added scene with Jon and the sacrificed kid.  Why was it necessary?  How convenient that one of Craster's wives had a son while Jon was around...4. Making Melisandre banging Stannis explicit is kinda lame, but it was the same with Renly+Loras.5. RAKHARO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO6. Atheist Davos and Saan.  Davos isn't a religious man, but he still keeps the Seven, and Saan keeps the Lord of Light.  Making them irreligious is fine, but atheism doesn't really fit the setting at all.7. Black Saan still bothers me -I would have no problem with Black Saan if they had changed his city of origin to one of the more cosmopolitan Free Cities, he could be gosh darned Pentoshi or Volantene, but they keep his city as Lys.  A black Lyseni!? Preposterous!The episode was a B- to me, because Balon is awesome as shit.

15	dtones520	2012-04-08	some of the changes aren't too major.. but jon playing winter woods detective and seeing others ? eh... I dunno lol.It's a way of reminding viewers of the Others, since they don't appear in the book, and showing what Craster does with his sons in a way that makes an impact on tv.
16	Ser Coffee The Bold	2012-04-08	So, is everyone else still pretty sure Jon isn't dead and is just knocked out?
17	Winter's Knight	2012-04-08	I should have seen Raquro's death coming, classic mauve shirting in the previous episode.#
This episode showed me two things:
1. I  can't remember any instance in the books where it is definitely confirmed that Cersei ordered the killings.
2. Replacing Slynt with Bronn instead of Swann is a brilliant way of highlighting Tyrion's hypocrisy.
18	Bastard of Boston	2012-04-08	Wow, after a lackluster premiere, episode 2 made me its bitch. Maybe the one thing that really bothered me about the premiere was lack of Arya?Seeing Arya, Gendry, Lommy, and Hot Pie reminded me of how much I enjoyed their rag tag in Clash. I can't help but chuckle everytime Arya calls someone a liar. So quickly, this group already seems like they'll have great chemistry going forward. Add Yoren and Jaqen into the mix, and this is one story arc that I'll look forward to every Sunday.I'm not a fan of Samwell in the book. But, this show struck gold with who they got to play him. He's hilarious without even saying anything...his constant bewildered or beguiled facial expressions are fantastic. And, Dolorous Edd! The reason I breathe is so that I can live long enough to hear his next line. He reminds me of Creed from The Office...all he needs is one line to warrant his premiere standing in the universe.Seeing Theon's arc start was fantastic. "Smile with your mouth closed." So awesome. I was apprehensive about who they chose as Asha/Yara, but I gotta say, so far, so good. I'm hoping she can grow into the role even if it's hard to see right now. Really glad they kept in the awkward incestual moment...it was one of my favorite parts of the book, and I've been waiting to see it on screen. Also, everytime a new location is added to the opening sequence (Pyke), an angel gets its wings.The Dragonstone bits, I'm still trying to digest. On the show, are they gonna axe the fact that Stannis is supposed to have a daughter? It seems such a vital aspect of the books...don't know how I feel about this. Melisandre appears to be much more the tempress on the show. I don't mind it...it's never put out there, but Mel got her Stannis shadowbaby somehow. Might as well play up the fact that Stannis gives in to her out of "duty" and desire.I wonder if Aegon the Conquerer ever used his dragon table for that.Salladhor is gonna be a lot of fun. Always good to get confirmation that there's black people in Westeros. Liked the scenes between Davos and his son...great setup for the spiritual battle at the heart of the Davos arc.Another brief Dany appearance this week...mirrors the book. One thing that took me by surprise, though...Rakharo is dead? That's a pretty big wtf moment considering, well, he's not supposed to die.Lastly, the King's Landing crew. Lena continues to kick my ass with her Cersei. This woman deserves some type of major award nom in the future. I like how they're developing her with Robert dead. Lena played her lowkey last year, but now she's able to unleash. The verbal battles between her and Tyrion are great...one burn after the next. Tyrion wins points for the funny...but, Cersei always goes in for the low blows.I like the idea that Joff is the one who ordered the bastards killed on the show. It seems like something he'd be more inclined to do...because he's a dick.POD appearance! Dolorous Edd and Pod are, lowkey, saving the universe...one scene at a time. Bronn as the head of the City Watch took me by surprise...but, this change makes sense. Not mad at the show for doing it. Beats introducing a new character who would just take up space.Littlefinger's scene with Ros makes up for the blasphemy that happened last week. It's time to build him back up to the devious force he is. And, the exclamation point on his assholery was the cum wipe.
19	Fez	2012-04-08	Was one of the weakest episodes in the series thus far, imo.  Not because of the changes, I don't care about that really, its just that it felt disjointed and dragged on too much in the middle. Also, and I say this for the first time ever, there was far too much sex. I was fine with Stannis/Mel scene (although, correct me if I'm wrong, this is a change from the books, yes? I thought it was never clear if Stannis had an affair or was seduced while asleep) but the Theon/Captain's daughter scene dragged on even worse than it did on the page and the brothel scene was completely unnecessary. I would much rather have preferred either another Arya scene, or some checking in with a character not in the episode; maybe show Joffrey being randomly cruel and stupid.
There were some definite great scenes of course; Tyrion/Slynt, Tyrion/Cersei, Davos/Saan, Theon/Balon, and Arya/Gendry were all really good, but they were surrounded by a lot that left a lot to be desired.
20	Envie	2012-04-08	Can someone please summarize the scene with Littlefinger and crying Ros - I'm totally lost. I have a hearing loss and even with headphones on and the sound cranked, I could not quite make out the entire convo since he whispered the entire thing. Ugh, frustrating! Who was the guy she was supposed to service and didn't? What's the story Littlefinger tells her about? I got the gist of it that she's really upset about the murder of the baby and LF is telling her about another woman (and that's the parts I couldn't hear right) -- would like hearing someone else's take on it.
					
					
							Edited by Envie, 08 April 2012 - 11:21 PM.
21	Ramsay Gimp	2012-04-08	Yea, Littlefinger was actually scary in this episode. Again, that's a feeling I never got from him in the books, but it's better than coming off stupid like he did last week.
22	Winter's Knight	2012-04-08	I adored Jaqen H'gar-and Sallador-props to the pirate for  stating he wouldn't rape Cersei.
23	sharkhawk	2012-04-08	I think Asha/Yara was perfectly cast.  Read some people on other sites saying she wasn't beautiful enough.  To me she was perfect, hot but with a Tomboy kind of imperfect look.  Real athletic looking.  The ship captains daughter was perfect too.  Meh looking (but not chubby enough) and dumb as a box of rocks.  The Roz scene could go.  I defended the role, but now don't see the point.  Bronn as city watch commander makes sense, no reason for another character there.  Also could live without having to show the Mel/Stan sex scene, but I guess that is to explain the shadow killing of Renly in the next ep or two.
I'm also not a big complainer about deviating from the book, but I wonder how they are going to write the next episode after Craster knocks out Jon.  I can't see the watch leaving after Craster brained him.
24	sharkhawk	2012-04-08	Oh loved the Sam and Jacqen casting too, and biter look great.
25	Ramsay Gimp	2012-04-08	Can someone please summarize the scene with Littlefinger and crying Ros - I'm totally lost. I have a hearing loss and even with headphones on and the sound cranked, I could not quite make out the entire convo since he whispered the entire thing. Ugh, frustrating!

I got the gist of it that she's really upset about the murder of the baby and LF is telling her about another woman (and that's the parts I couldn't hear right) -- would like hearing someone else's take on it.She's traumatized by the baby-killing. Littlefingers acts like he's going to comfort her, putting his arm around her and whispering and such. But then he tells a story about a beautiful Lyseni whore he once bought who acted similarly depressed, and therefore couldn't get customers. "I hate bad investments...they haunt me," he tells Ros. Then he tells how he eventually sold this Lyseni to some Lord who wanted to "transform her", as a way of mitigating Littlefinger's losses. It was all a not-so-veiled threat to Ros: get your act together, youere here to make money, not cry and drive away customers.What he meant by "transform" I don't even want to know. Sounded like some Qyburn shit
26	HokieStone	2012-04-08	I think this may be my least favorite episode of the entire series, although it did have it's high points as well. 
- Asha, er, "Yara" - My first reaction is "blah" - she doesn't show the same fire that she shows in the books.  Hopefully she grows on me.
- Hated the Littlefinger brothel scene.  Hated it.  Or at least, the first part, the voyeurism and the gag with wiping the whore's face off, and have her immediately kiss another man.  It again smacks of "we're on HBO, we'll show this just because we can".
- Stannis.  Two episodes in, and I'm not buying Stannis yet.  Personally, I never suspected a Stannis-Mel tryst in the books, but after seeing other comments, I can look back and see that it was hinted at.  But the way it was done here...meh, that's not Stannis for me.  But it's not just that...I will have trouble fully explaining, but he just doesn't fully act or talk like Stannis to me.  For whatever reason, what jumped out at me in this episode was when he called Renly his "little brother".  Maybe it's because to me "little brother" is most often used as a term of endearment...but I just don't ever see Stannis saying the words "My little brother".
27	Rockroi	2012-04-08	So, I am starting to have a significant issue with the disparate nature of the series.  Its not that I cannot follow whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going on; its that I cannot really enjoy whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going on.   Before I can really enjoy Tyrion/Stannis/Arya in their mortal danger we seem to jump to the next characterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mortal danger; interspersed with this is the reality that much of what the characters are doing is still at the introduction level (most notably the Greyjoys and Stannis). With that as a backdrop, here is what I liked:Arya: I think Aryaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s story-line is picking up well and staying true and straight.  In other words, we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have much redirection away from the important stuff in the books.  We get the meat on the bone and not any fat and we still feel satisfied.  Of all the parts of the story, hers is the most even. Tyrion: Basically, the best part of the book Clash of Kings remains the best part (overall) of Season two of GoT.  Tyrion is smart (so fucking smart); heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s self-aware (as opposed to, say, Ned who had no idea just how blind he was), and confident.  All the while heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s enjoyable, funny and bright.  His dialog with Varys is not hard to follow but not really â<U+0080><U+009C>dumbed-downâ<U+0080><U+009D> from the book.   He is feisty and full of life; power does not appear to be the chore it was to Ned (and the fact that Tyrion references Ned was a nice touch). Balon Greyjoy: I am stunned that I didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want to puncture my ear drum with his scenes.  Balon Greyjoy is one of my least favorite characters in one of my least favorite story-lines.  But here, is sounded more even and reasonable than he had in the book.  Nicely done. Ghost: Oh good; youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re still here.Jon and Sam: Their scenes hold up really well; Sam is a much more complete character in the series than in the books.  Jon is also very good- he has a harder edge to him than book Jon who was trying so hard not to outwardly appear like he wanted anything.  In the series, Samâ<U+0080><U+0099>s intelligence is not hampered by this need to show him as a coward; he is a smart guy whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s intelligence has a good voice.  Jon meanwhile is conflicted and brooding but it has a humanity.  Not bad at all. Jury is still out:Stannis the Priestess Fucker:  Again, much like Renly and the Hound and â<U+0080><U+009C>Sheaâ<U+0080><U+0099>daâ<U+0080><U+0099>funneeâ<U+0080><U+0099>horrâ<U+0080><U+009D>, Series Stannis is different than book Stannis.  And that takes getting used to.  In the book, Stannis was all Iron.  He has this confident and determined stride to him; he was impersonal, but starkly determined and grim.  This Stannis seems a lot more flaky and chittering; like heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s trying to act tough but his name sounds less like â<U+0080><U+009C>Stannis!â<U+0080><U+009D> and more like â<U+0080><U+009C>Melvin.â<U+0080><U+009D>   This Stannis lacks that iron-will that brooked no compromise and even less confusion.  Series Stannis seems unsure, vacillating and almost timid. And the fact that book Stannis was adamant about adultery makes his sweeping fuck of Mel on the Painted Table to be a little off-putting. Then again, if that woman showed me that bodyâ<U+0080>¦The artificial cliff-hanger:  I can understand why we had to catch Craster throwing his kids to the Others?  But why the lame cliff-hanger?  ZOMG!  I wonder what happened?The Absence of Robb/Bran/Joff/Cat/Renly/Jaime/Sansa: We didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see hide nor tail of like half the cast this episode.  And I really think that is a good thing; the show needs to get tighter.  At the same time, those characters are doing and seeing a lot that needs explanation and perhaps some items that we did not see in the books.  But that leads me, inexoriably, toâ<U+0080>¦What I did Not Like:A Tear For Roz: Just. Stop.  The experiment has failed.  Roz isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t working.  And in an episode where you could not find time for (see above), you found time for this ancillary character?  So we could see how upset she was?  And Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not saying the woman playing her is not the second-coming of Merril Streep or anything but in a scene where the character is crying it would help if the character was actually crying.  ANYWAY- Peter gets to tell us a story about what a hard-ass he is.  We knew that already.  What did this scene tell us?   Not sure. All I know is that its leading me to this new game we should play- you know that web meme â<U+0080><U+0093> Evil Bert? Where Bert pops up in pictures of Osama bin Laden and the JFK assassination and at Klan Rallies?  Well, I am wondering what the show will do next with Roz?  Where will she appear next?  Will she be an Astapor slaver?  Will she vote for Lord Commander of the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch?  Will she be in Oldtown?  Seriously?  Where will this completely disposable character end up next? Overall, it was a very fragmented episode wherein every scene felt like it should have gone on longer or had more in it and where nothing felt connected or integrated.  It was not bad, but it was somewhat forgettable.
28	The Red Lamb Chop	2012-04-08	I think the point of the Stannis/Mel sex scene was so that when Mel gives birth to her Stannis shadow baby thing, it's not gonna be a "Well how did that get there?" moment. Like, when people ask "What the heck? How is Mel giving birth to that?" they'll be able to point back and be like "Aha! You see, when Mel told Stannis she would give him a son and he impregnated her (in what was to me a very awkward sex-scene), she actually meant that demonic thing was the son." so all in all, she does give him a son; it's just not human...Speaking of Stannis's heir, was I the only one saddened by the confirmation of Shireen's nonexistence?
29	Ser Hippie	2012-04-08	Liked this episode a lot apart from a couple of scenes.
LF/Ros - just felt unnecessary and I'd rather have spent time elsewhere.
Asha/Yara seemed a bit off to me but I'm not too bothered.
Loved Sallador (I also enjoyed one recap where the reviewer who didn't know his name referred to him as "Salad or Sandwich"), Balon was nailed perfectly. The Tyrion/Varys, Tyrion/Janos and Tyrion/Cersei scenes were fantastic as well, especially when you see Tyrion realizing the mess he's stuck in.
Arya/Gendry was done well, and I'm glad to see Yoren's translated well to the screen, as I'm a big fan of him in the books.

30	Dark14	2012-04-08	I figured Asha(yara) would be better looking to.
Why would they kill Rhakaro to he is kinda needed why not just recast him if that's the issue i mean he had like two lines in season one who would have noticed. kinda PO'd at that. Same with Stannis/Mel isn't the whole thing with Stannis that he always does the right thing no matter if its hard... now he just looks like a man to go out whoring with Robert and Mel looks a whore instead of priestess.
31	Sphinx The Riddle	2012-04-08	I wonder if Aegon the Conquerer ever used his dragon table for that. /cheers.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cheers:' />
32	Ramsay Gimp	2012-04-08	God, must people hate on everything new? Davos and Sall were great in this episode. Yara is a good fit as well. Warrior women shouldnt be beautiful - she was sexy, which is all that matters as far as her looks are concerned. And she played the role well
33	Envie	2012-04-08	She's traumatized by the baby-killing. Littlefingers acts like he's going to comfort her, putting his arm around her and whispering and such. But then he tells a story about a beautiful Lyseni whore he once bought who acted similarly depressed, and therefore couldn't get customers. "I hate bad investments...they haunt me," he tells Ros.

Sounded like some Qyburn shitThank you SO much - man that scene confused the crap out of me. I knew Littlefinger was threatening her somehow but since I couldn't really hear what he was whispering that well, and none of that is from the books, I lost the whole conversation pretty much. I'm not sure why that scene was necessary AT ALL. I have defended Ros's addition to the cast in the past pretty heavily - saying how she's been a great transition device to tie together some of the loose ends with a few characters we don't get all the details about in the show... and that she's probably headed for another role in Alayaya's place... but this scene with Littlefinger seemed complete pointless unless I'm missing the point along with my hearing! /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
34	TeemuOfHouseSelanne	2012-04-08	Was that definitely Rhakaro? He doesn't play a huge role in the books, but as Dance progressed GRRM seemed to be building him up for some sort of Queensguard-type position or something. I saw a version without Dothraki subtitles so I'm not totally clued in.
Tyion/Slynt is one of my favorite moments and I thought the show nailed it. Bronn taking over the goldcloaks can only be considered a plus, his relationship with Tyrion was one of the best parts of season 1 and this just allows for more Bronn then we would have had, while not affecting how his character arc plays out. Balon was damn near perfect, Asha had the 'tude but maybe not the look. Davos never really speaks allowed about his support for the seven in the books, rather keeping those thoughts to himself, so I have no problem with how the show is approaching his beliefs, especially because the casting choice was damn near perfect.
Excited to see Marg and Brienne next week.
Also just wanted to touch on the Stannis/Mel bangfest, I think it's one of the few instances where HBO actually succesfully uses sex to help the plot along. While reading it didn't occur to me that Stannis was actually banging Mel till she offered it up to Davos. It may have really confused a TV audience when Mel has a Stannis shadow baby later on.
Speaking on Mel, that's exactly how I pictured her. Great casting call.

							Edited by Sphinx The Riddle, 08 April 2012 - 11:36 PM.
36	Corvinus	2012-04-08	Didn't like the Rakharo thing one bit. Something tells me that he still would have had a role to play past ADWD. Maybe now they can bring Jogo.
37	J_Crews	2012-04-08	The loss of Rakharo was a bit jarring to me, but the other changes were mild in my opinion. 
Having Joffrey be responsible for the purge of his father's (or so he thinks) bastards makes him a better villain; Jon witnessing Craster giving the babe up to the Others is more powerful than learnig about it through exposition; Bronn acting as a stand-in for Ser Jacelyn Bywater keeps them from having to pay another actors salary just to have him do Tyrion's bidding all season (which Bronn is also all about anyway), then croak in the Battle of the Blackwater -- I, personally, really liked Bywater, but he turned-out to be a throw-away character unworthy of a TV adaptation; and, the Stannis/Melisandre thing may've never been expressly laid-out in the books, but it was hinted at.  How else would she be pregnant with his shadow babies twice in upcoming situations?  Also, the books are told through POVs, of which we get none for either of them until several books later, so how could we have seen it?
I must say I did rather miss the playful banter that marked Theon's initial meeting with Asha (Yara in the show) from the book, though.  It wouldn't've hurt a bit to leave that dialogue in there. 
Lved, loved, loved Pyke, by the way!  Pretty much exactly as it was described in the books. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
38	Mya Stone	2012-04-08	my problem with craster doming Jon is.. wheres Ghost??Hunting for food? Playing poker with Dolorous Edd? Drooling over Craster's wives/daughters unnoticed? /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
39	koftroy	2012-04-08	I will write more later....but there were a few changes I did not like
I still have a problem with Jon being portrayed as belligerent and following Craster? WHERE IS GHOST? I know we saw him once, but Ghost being by Jon's side is a key element of his character . He should have been sitting next to Jon when Sam came over.  Also Jon is not disobedient at this point, he is doing his thing....here they show him as easily aggravated, but he does act like Ned, in giving Craster the evil eye, judging! The thing Jaime Lannister hated sbouy Ned....he was all judgey. He also really needs to find out what is going on with the boys. Maybe it is part of the hurt he still feels as being a Bastard they did that?
I saw the need to introduce an Other at this point, as we always knew C is a dirtbag. I know they only have 10 episodes.  But they could have just doubled that scene in the book when Jon goes into the woods to look for Ghost and finds Dragonglass next to the body of the dead Ranger.  
Stannis & Melissandre? We all knew that was going on. But when I re-read the books, I felt Stannis was not so much under her spell, but was using it to differentiate himself.   Davos was great and they really aged his son up! 
Cersei is finally acting like Cersei! They waste screen time with all that Brothel crap....that could have been using to see more NW.
Also Arya was awesome, and Jaqen Hagar...I know I can't spell it. He was kind of sexy actually. 
Arya telling Gendry who she really is? I am not sure about that and she has gotten so much taller.
That is it for now...
Raakharo dying? He is there throughout all the books, like her Silver. Jorah's love for Dany is creepy in the book. Here it looks kind of hot
40	CrypticWeirwood	2012-04-08	Speaking of Stannis's heir, was I the only one saddened by the confirmation of Shireen's nonexistence?We donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know that. She isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a son. It only said Selse had given Stannis no sons, that they were all stillborn. Shireen isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t  a son.  She might still exist. Who knows? Time will tell.
41	Envie	2012-04-08	Ok here's my likes:
- Pyke / Balon Greyjoy - just the way I imagined them, perfect casting and artistry in rendering the island keep, walkways, gloomy interior complete with kraken fireplace.
- Loved the Tyrion / Janos Slynt scene - perfectly done. Pretty much every scene with Tyrion is spot on.
- Arya/Gendry/Hotpie/ - Jaqen, Biter etc. etc - great scenes, true to book, well casted actors, great chemistry happening that conveys a sense of growing friendship that's essential for later parts of their story.
Dislikes:
I wasn't fond of the Tyrion / Cersei scene this time around. Lena Headey seemed a bit off this week, I'm not sure why. Maybe this is my perception of her 'slipping' a bit further out of control?
Didn't like the cliffhanger ending with such a drastic change from the books. I realize they need a way to tie in revealing what happens with the boys and all that, but Craster smacking Jon over the head? That's so far off the story - I'm disappointed.
Didn't like the Ros / Littlefinger scene - even though I couldn't hear it, even knowing now what the convo was about, I felt it was pointless
And lastly - I don't like the actress picked for Asha Greyjoy at all. I'm female so I'm not going to go on about her not being 'sexy' enough (that's personal opinion)... I just don't feel she portrayed Asha's incredible quick wit, smartass attitude and huge confidence nearly well enough AT ALL. Her eyes are too droopy, she looked constantly insolent... not cocky and self confident.

42	areacode201	2012-04-08	The actor that plays Rakharo got a better gig, that's why they killed him off IIRC.
43	N. Baratheon	2012-04-08	Speaking of Stannis's heir, was I the only one saddened by the confirmation of Shireen's nonexistence?Me too, if only because it looks like both her (with her Greyscale) and Patchface (who there's obviously more to than meets the eye) will have some level of importance as the books progress.  But, I'm hoping that Stannis just wants a son so bad he's not even acknowledging his daughter's existence.
44	sharkhawk	2012-04-08	I've got a question.  The others haven't been seen for 8,000 years, yet Craster is giving his sons to them and has presumbly been doing so for years.  Were they just waiting till they had enough of Craster's sons to create an army?  The rangers have been visiting Craster for years but only now the others are going after everyone.
45	DirePenguin	2012-04-08	Envie - similar impression. Slightly different opinion.
I thought Cercei/Tyrion scene was weak due to the whole idea of the conversation itself. It did reveal some very important insight about how Cercei came to hate Tyrion other wise.
Jon's . . . I actually hate the part where he was kinda running alone and stumble on things . . . didn't make any sense. He was running alone, in the dark, wearing all blacks for god's sake. Could have made him stalk around a bit smarter than that : /
Littlefinger ... I don't know, I don't like any porn scene in this series in general. The girl with sement in her mouth was .... ew. I found Greyjoy's sex scene a bit more disturbing tho for some unknown reason.

46	Arrogant Bastard	2012-04-08	Good episode overall, though not without it's faults. 
Stuff I liked a lot:
--Tyrion with Varys and Janos. Great scene between him and Varys, and I'm glad they kept that "paddling" line of Varys's. Also, really enjoyed seeing Tyrion take Janos apart, and naming Bronn captain of the Gold Cloaks is a good way of not having to cast Jacelyn. Loved that they kept Bronn's best line in the series too.
--Arya. Maisie Williams is still fantastic, and I enjoyed her scenes with both Gendry and Jaqen. Also liked the new Yoren line about "shaving a spiders' arse" when threatening the gold cloaks.
--Balon Greyjoy and Pyke. Pyke looks fantastic, and the guy playing Balon really did a tremendous job. I'm glad they kept that scene almost identical to teh books, and retained the "iron, gold" discussion about Theon's bauble.
--Davos and Salladhor Saan. Great scene, and very impressed with the guy playing Saan.
Nitpicks
--Tyrion mentioning Robert's bastards as potential claimants to the throne. Um, no they're not, and Tyrion would know better.
--Ros scene. Scene was pretty good actually, adn well acted, but hardly necessary. I think the time could have been better spent elsewhere, as it didn't really reveal anything new or add any characterization; everyone knows Littlefinger is a shit weasel already.
--Stannis and Melisandre. Seems like they're just trying to hard to show everything, instead of keeping some things subtle. 
Gripes
I really only have one big gripe about the episode, adn it's the ending. Really lame cliffhanger that was hardly necessary. NOt every episode needs to end with a cliffhanger, and this one was by far the worst of the cliffhangers. Felt straight out of True Blood, and it's hardly suspenseful because nobody is really going to think Jon won't come out of this ok.
47	Sound_of_winter	2012-04-09	A bit iffy with this episode, there were good parts:
- Pod makes an cameo! /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
- Edd and his fart jokes
- Davos/san/ and Matthos
- Arya and the gang
- Cersei tearing up Tyrion
- Tyrion tearing up Janos
 Stuff that threw me way off:
- sooo many sex scenes, I wanna see Robb, or Bran, or Sansa instead! /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
- Was Theon FINGERING Asha? O__o
- the girl playing Asha looks pretty decent, but she mumbles a bit.
48	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-09	I was disgusted by the Theon and Asha/Yara scene in a way that I never was with Jaime and Cersei.  Maybe it's because I've already developed sort of a pity for Theon.  I seriously wanted to wash my eyes out with lye as I was watching it.  I'm not sold on the actor playing Asha.  She lacked that spunk book Asha has. 
I'm very surprised with how explicit they are being with things that are only hinted at in the books.  I know GRRM works closely with the show, so I wonder if he's giving a silent nod to all of the theorizing that goes on in the forums or if the producers are just using their own theories.  I mean, it's hinted enough times that Stannis and Mel have done the dirty but we are never really sure.  There have been some amazing theories about what Craster does with his sons and giving them to the Others is not one that I bought into.  I wish I knew if we can use the show to learn more about the books.
I reread parts of the books dealing with the killing of the bastards this past week and I found that it's never really stated that Cersei is the one who ordered it.  Slynt said it was orders but never mentions the queen.  The only time anyone says it was Cersei was Tyrion and Varys only agreed that it was a terrible thing.  So it could have been Joffrey since it was done around the same time that Joff found out about the incest rumors. 
I really like who they cast as Jaqen.  I had imagined him as a slimy, creepy man.  The scene was great.  Still, I wish Arya had brought him some water.
Pyke looked amazing.  Balon was amazing.  I was not sold on Asha/Yara.  She didn't have any spunk.  I was disgusted with the Theon/Yara scene in a way I never was with Jaime/Cersei.  Maybe it's because I have already developed a pity for Theon after reading so much about what the future holds for him.  Maybe it was just because the actress playing Yara wasn't very good.
I had been defending Ros' inclusion on the show but I'm losing faith.  I can't figure out what they are building her up for.  I'm not entirely sure what that entire scene was even supposed to be telling us about Littlefinger.  It starts out with him spying on his whores...are his whores his spies?...then turns disgusting when he wipes semen from a whores mouth and then watches her kiss a patron with that same mouth then he goes on to threaten Ros.  All of his previous scenes have already showed us that he's a player in the games and that he has no problem playing dirty so what new were we supposed to learn? 
Dolorous Edd made me laugh so hard that I spewed Dr. Pepper from my nose.  It hurt.  I had to clean my nose up, rewind and watch again just so I could laugh properly.  I didn't appreciate his character in the books because I couldn't quite understand the dour nature he was supposed to have.  The show makes me appreciate his comic value.
49	Lordtoofat2sitAthrone	2012-04-09	Asha was ok, I wasn't really taken in by the actor but they didn't keep the whole scene.  Balon kinda reffered to her and she made a joke about Theon's garb, and earlier on horseback, she just kinda let Theon play with her while he brags.  She didn't come off as a swaggering, confident type - wishing she had been born a man like Cersei, but she really didn't leave an impression.  I'm a little miffed about the cliffhanger and I don't understand it.  How hard would it have been for Gilly to have said, "he gives our sons to the Gods?"  Leaving it a mystery to the viewer as to exactly what that means.  If someone can explain this decision to me, please do.  
I'm not a purist by any stretch, changes for expediency, or because of budget limitation or time constraints is fine.  But that ticked me off.  Where is Patchface? Where is this dynamic between Queen's Men and King's Men?  Where are the Reeds?  I'm not upset about the damphair because he can be omitted without any great loss untill the events of the 4th book.  I think this is the start of some serious deviation.  Not that's necessarily a bad thing.  I remember an interview with the showrunners that said each season won't so much tell the story of the book, but when it's viewed as a whole, will tell the story of "ASOIAF."  Which I'm fine with.
50	Mark Antony	2012-04-09	This was a decent episode; I enjoyed "The North Remembers" more though.
- Jaqen was pretty good, I liked him. Rorge and Biter were okay, not really what I pictured at all but Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll live. Yoren was bad ass as fuck in the opening scene. His death is going to suck. Hope its epic. I liked Gendry a lot as well; Arya scenes were definitely highlights this episode.
-Can't stand Shae, I just don't get why they changed the character so much and why is she staying in the tower of the hand? enjoyed Varys/Tyrion going at it though.
- Loved the Tyrion/Janos scene even though it was ten times better in the books. I get why they made Bronn the Lord Commander of the City Watch, I was hoping to see Jacelyn Bywater but no big deal.
- Ghost looked fucking awesome
- so which blood rider did they kill off? didn't like that change honestly.
-Geez I hate Theon just as much on the show as I did when I was reading Clash, not how I pictured Asha (Yara) but whatever I was actually happy with the ironborn scenes. Thought Balon was perfect.
- Littlefinger/Ros= Mehhhh, I just don't like what they did with Littlefinger and I hate Ros so.....
- Davos is the man, Salladhor Saan was casted perfectly imo. Great scene, KING STANNIS IS MY GOD
- Not really mad that they pinned King Roberts bastards murders on Joffrey and really enjoyed the Cersei/Tyrion scene
- I'm sold on Stannis already, really like the casting, surprised by him and Mellisandre just straight up fucking but I guess they got to make shadow babies somehow, No Shireen!! I don't see why they cut her out?
- I get they wanted to show what Craster does with his sons but they could've handled it much better imo. I could barely even tell that what picked the baby up until I saw the blue eyes but I think they could have made it clearer that it was a white walker, and Craster finding Jon and hitting him upside the head? idk just didn't like how much this episode differed from the books.
- No Robb, Catelyn, Sansa, Renly, Jaime, Tywin, etc. This is probably one of my least favorite episodes of the entire series but still enjoyed it a lot. Solid 7
51	DannySpud	2012-04-09	There have been some amazing theories about what Craster does with his sons and giving them to the Others is not one that I bought into.  I wish I knew if we can use the show to learn more about the books.I thought it was book-confirmed that he gave them to the Others? I don't really do any theorising with asoiaf (hell I only heard of R+L=J about a month ago...) but I was always under the impression that that was what happened, I'll have to find the bit in the books.Finally I can talk on here about this episode (and finally I can actually get on the website...)My episode thoughts:I was a bit uncomfortable with the Arya peeing scene.The Yara/Theon scene was creepier than I was expecting, I thought she should have kept trying to stop him rather than let him finger her.Iron islands look amazingMel is hot (no pun intended). I liked how Stannis was refusing to sleep with her until she insisted she could give him a son. Shows how much he wants a son.I am assuming that was Rhakaro (bloodrider who Dany had a moment with last ep) who came back without a body. Is there something that confirms this since we didn't see his face? So much for him replacing Daario...Ghost is huge, I feel sorry for Quorin.The Others are so well done, I get chills when I see those blue eyes.So Craster has captured Jon. Will this be the catalyst for Jon being sent to the wildlings?So some deviations from the book, but that's okay, I like not knowing whats going to happen.
52	Lord Belmore	2012-04-09	It was good as usual, but I'll nitpick a bit. My three biggest issues with the episode:
1. Craster/Jon Cliffhanger. This feels really out of place, and I'm curious to see how they resolve this. I suppose it doesn't have to harm anything important (Jeor can die any number of ways without much loss, the Craster/Others reveal still occurs) if they do it properly. This could quickly become a non-issue, but it just shocked me somewhat.
2. As almost everyone has noted, Yara/Asha really lacked the spice that made the character jump out in the books. I don't care about her appearance (and very well would have expected her not to be comely), but the personality simply has not made the jump to the screen.
3. I'm still also sad about Patchface and Shireen apparently being out. The Dragonstone scenes had such a creepy atmosphere in the books, and they were part of it.
Thankfully, I don't see any of these mattering too much going forward. Shae is annoying, but that will just make a certain moment that much better. Also, was I the only one kind of glad when Rakharo died simply because they scared me into thinking they'd stick him in as a love interest for Daenerys based on the previous episode?
53	Frumpus	2012-04-09	I don't see why anyone cares that Rakharo died. He barely plays a role in the series as a whole and his character/role is easily expendable/replaceable.
Sallador Saan being black only bugs me because the only reason he's black is because the series was overdue for some ethnic diversity. So he's the token black guy. Personally I still think they should have just had Jalabhar Xho appearing in the background.
54	aimlessgun	2012-04-09	So much awesome little stuff in the episode and it flowed together pretty well too. So many actors knocking it out of the park.
It's funny talking about how Ros is wasting our time again, but it occurs to me that the Dany section was just as much a waste of time (and I'm not a Dany hater). Though I guess if Rakharo's actor had to leave the show they did have to give him a sendoff.
55	CloudFlare	2012-04-09	Loved it. The change in Joffrey's actions are believable, and show his malicious nature.Didn't like the Rakharo thing one bit. Something tells me that he still would have had a role to play past ADWD. Maybe now they can bring Jogo.I loved how they showed his death. It was nice from a viewing perspective, and a 'reader of the books' perspective. From a viewing perspective, it was clever how the horse came out of the mirage. From a reader perspective, it threw in a nice curveball. I was suspecting that one of her blood riders would return with emissaries, of the location of the ghost city.\ Bronn as city watch commander makes sense, no reason for another character there.Yep. It also makes more sense for Tyrion to put someone loyal to himself in charge.I found Greyjoy's sex scene a bit more disturbing tho for some unknown reason.It was a lot like the early Dany/Drogo love scene. The women are powerless in the scenes, and whether they enjoy the physical act or not is highly debatable.
56	Tim Maxwell	2012-04-09	Will they ever bring in Mormont's Raven?  /cry
57	Ser Coffee The Bold	2012-04-09	I'm seeing a recurring theme to the hates: patchface & Shireen, Ros, Stannis Mel sex, and Jon cliffhanger.
Shireen and the fool may be offscreen with Stannis's wife, TV viewers don't need to see them because they aren't yet players in the game of thrones.
The Mel Stannis scene was totes forgivable because it will explain the shadow baby... which never was explained in the books and was more of a WTF GRRM? when I read it. It also explains why Stannis becomes more devout.
Even though the last scene left me with a bad taste in my mouth for the cliffhanger, I'll say it explained something we all expect craster was doing with his boys, giving them to the others.
To me though, HBO gets an excuse for one Jon cliffhanger because all we have to do is wait a week to find out he is actually OK. GRRM is making us wait years to find out what's with Jon in the next book on one hell of a cliffhanger.
58	Qhorin Halfhand and Yoren	2012-04-09	The way they are focusing on Ros, I think that Ros will be the one who will be forced to marry Ramsay in the show as fake Arya.

59	DannySpud	2012-04-09	There have been some amazing theories about what Craster does with his sons and giving them to the Others is not one that I bought into."He gives the boys to the gods. Come the white cold, he does, and of late it comes more often. Thats why he started giving them sheep, even though he has a taste for mutton. Only now the sheep're gone too. Next it will be dogs, 'tillâ<U+0080>¦" She lowered her eyes and stroked her belly. "What gods?" Jon was remembering that they'd seen no boys in Crasters Keep, nor men either, save Craster himself."The cold gods", she said. "The ones in the night. The white shadows." And suddenly Jon was back in the Lord Commanders Tower again. A severed hand was climbing his calf and when he pried it off with the point of his longsword, it lay writhing, fingers opening and closing. The dead man rose to his feet, blue eyes shining in that gashed and swollen face. Ropes of torn flesh hung from the great wound in his belly, yet there was no blood."What color are their eyes?" he asked her."Blue. As bright bright as blue stars, and as cold."Seems pretty clear to me.
60	CloudFlare	2012-04-09	The way they are focusing on Ros, I think that Ros will be the one who will be forced to marry Ramsay in the show as fake Arya.Possibly as fake Sansa? I'd hate to see that happen, but cutting out the marriage subplot might move things along.
61	Qhorin Halfhand and Yoren	2012-04-09	Possibly as fake Sansa? I'd hate to see that happen, but cutting out the marriage subplot might move things along.No, as fake Arya. Jeyne Poole's role.
62	Francisco R. Fonseca	2012-04-09	Okay my thoughts:
1. was surprised at the change w/Joffrey, and doesn't make sense s/l-wise. That's typical Cersei.
2. Rahkaro dying....WTF, he doesn't die in ACOK. I felt it was unnecessary. Where's he not as important as Jorah, ut was a surprise.
3. I was really looking forward to the scene where Arya kicks Hot Pie's ass w/her wooden sword, missed that.
4. LOVED Ghost.....OMG that was so cool. I'm loving the direwolves this season,
5. Like Gendry, think they portray him well.
6. Mel & Stannis, didn't have a problem w/it but it wasn't in the book and Stannis was never depicted as very sexual IMO. As another said it's like Renly & Loras, a scene we never saw.
7. Oh almost forgot....the scene w/Janos seemed rushed and I didn't feel the same energy I did in the book. I mean Tyrion seemed like he was happy but...idk was off to me. and Bronn as Commander of the City Watch? That could work.
8. I liked Jon's scenes.
Despite some gripes I did enjoy it & like it isn't exactly the same.
63	DannySpud	2012-04-09	The way they are focusing on Ros, I think that Ros will be the one who will be forced to marry Ramsay in the show as fake Arya.No. If they do this then I will join the Ros haters. Why do people think this will happen? Ros is a woman and Arya a girl, Esme Bianco is literally twice as old as Maisie Williams (just checked), no one in the show should be fooled by that switch.
64	CloudFlare	2012-04-09	No, as fake Arya. Jeyne Poole's role.While everyone in the books closes their eyes and go 'It's Arya Aray Arya!' I can't see them doing the same for Ros. The red hair is just too much of a stretch.

Yeah, after rethinking it, I think you two are right.
67	Laohu	2012-04-09	So, is everyone else still pretty sure Jon isn't dead and is just knocked out?Well, in this episode, he did not die -- ok, MAYBE lose consciousness -- from several stab wounds. Jon simply took a clubbing to the head. Nothing to get worked up about /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
68	Magjee	2012-04-09	No, as fake Arya. Jeyne Poole's role.*Ugh* that would be a disaster.
69	David Selig	2012-04-09	Really good episode, much better than last week's IMO. I liked pretty much everything, even the Ros scene was decent, and somewhat necessary for non-readers to get what a ruthless bastard Littlefinger is. I guess I am ove of the few who liked Asha/Yara. Davos and Saan were good and the Stannis scenes worked better this time. The Yoren/Arya/Gendry scenes were really well done. Oh, and I love that Craster owned Jon again. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />The way they are focusing on Ros, I think that Ros will be the one who will be forced to marry Ramsay in the show as fake Arya.How the hell would this happen? The ages don't match at all. Nobody at all would be fooled which makes it pointless.

(only spoiler tagged because it's a long post)Yeah, I posted an even clearer scene earlier (its on the previous page of this thread).
71	Brewmaster	2012-04-09	A few quick points:
A couple people mentioned they were freaked out by theon fingering Yara. That didn't happen. He was just rubbing low on her stomach, he was never fingering her.
Second, a bunch of people said stannis sexing Mel was only hinted at in the books. Again, not true. It was clearly revealed in the books that they were having sex.
Anyway, I thought the episode was good. A lot better than last weeks episode. Arya's bit was the best part, IMO. I also really enjoyed Theon's.
72	CloudFlare	2012-04-09	Was Littlefinger spying on someone having sex, or was he spying on someone spying on someone who was having sex?
73	koftroy	2012-04-09	I did not remember the quote about the Others from CofK....it is so hard to remember everything. I will always Asha Greyjoy, Asha...it was stupid to change her name. 
Plus she had thick dark hair she wore in a long braid down her back. So she became one of my fave characters...but on the show? She had better be more badass.
I liked the friendship between Arya and Gendry.  In the book I felt he had a little crush on her..but isn't she like 10 in the book and Gendry like 14 or something? Here, I think she is almost 12....but I love Arya.
74	Ser Coffee The Bold	2012-04-09	Was Littlefinger spying on someone having sex, or was he spying on someone spying on someone who was having sex?Both... at first the first one, then the second one. I love how creepy and brooding the series is making Littlefinger look. This is why I like the Ros addition to the show, it gave us a backstory to Theon in season 1 and Littlefinger in season 2
75	WillWork4NinjaPowers	2012-04-09	Hated they killed Rhakaro, he was hot.  Still irritated they killed Silver. I do not enjoy the Mel and Stannis scenes.  I liked Saan and Davos.
76	DannySpud	2012-04-09	I liked the friendship between Arya and Gendry.  In the book I felt he had a little crush on her..but isn't she like 10 in the book and Gendry like 14 or something? Here, I think she is almost 12....but I love Arya.Yeah, I felt like GRRM was building up to a cute love thing between them until they went their separate ways. That made me sad, I hope they meet again.
77	Knight of Ashes	2012-04-09	Book Joffrey would never do that. It would be like Joffrey admitting to himself that he isn't Robert's son, or is there any other reason to order the killing of Robert's bastards?I think TV Joffrey may suspect, deep down, that he's not Robert's son. This version is at least, a bit smarter.
78	J_Crews	2012-04-09	A couple people mentioned they were freaked out by theon fingering Yara. That didn't happen. He was just rubbing low on her stomach, he was never fingering her.Yet, in the book, she squeezed his package, like, 4 times, and nobody is saying anything about that.
79	Fryie	2012-04-09	RAKHARO WTF
JON WTF
STANNIS HYPERSEXUALISED WTF
this series is going to change quite a bit of the story. OTOH, i don't see how they can tell it all in just 10 episodes without significant editing, so i'll just have to get used to it; a bit sad, though, season 1 was more faithful to the story.
i liked the acting and the theme of the ros scene, actually, although i agree that screen time is wasted on this non-character. but perhaps she's somehow going to play a bigger role in the future?
but to not just simply point out the bad stuff, here's what i liked most:
- Gendry is <3, as is Gilly (however brief her appearance). Skins was a very good series, before it turned boring (after season 2), and I'm glad those two actors made it to an HBO production.
- Arya ~ nuff said
- Varys. Just. fucking. awesome.
- Balon. Wow, what an appearance.
80	Qhorin Halfhand and Yoren	2012-04-09	I think TV Joffrey may suspect, deep down, that he's not Robert's son. This version is at least, a bit smarter.Yeah TV Joffrey is older and somewhat less naive than book Joffrey and it does come of as believable. I don't have a problem with that change, I also liked how they made us wonder who was behind it, until of course it was revealed

81	DirePenguin	2012-04-09	2. Rahkaro dying....WTF, he doesn't die in ACOK. I felt it was unnecessary. Where's he not as important as Jorah, ut was a surprise. Was that Rahkaro? I think I heard the woman screamed Quohollo.
82	Odie Wan Kenodie	2012-04-09	I love the scene between Vary and Tyrion "And I keep on paddling"
83	J_Crews	2012-04-09	I'm very surprised with how explicit they are being with things that are only hinted at in the books.  I know GRRM works closely with the show, so I wonder if he's giving a silent nod to all of the theorizing that goes on in the forums or if the producers are just using their own theories.  I mean, it's hinted enough times that Stannis and Mel have done the dirty but we are never really sure.  There have been some amazing theories about what Craster does with his sons and giving them to the Others is not one that I bought into.  I wish I knew if we can use the show to learn more about the books.The book specifically states that's what Craster has been doing in two separate conversations: one between Jon and Gilly; then later between Jon and Lord Commander Mormont, clarifying that all the NW Rangers know about it and pretty much don't ice the old bastard only because his place being there keeps them alive at times.  As for the rest: the book story is told exclusively through character POVs, so it wouldn't have been possible to show what Stannis/Melisandre were doing behind closed doors.  We don't get a Melisandre POV until ADwD and we've never had one for Stannis to date.  I, for one, think it's more than a theory, however; she gives birth to at least 2 of his shadow babies, one of which is witnessed first-hand by Davos.I'm not entirely sure what that entire scene was even supposed to be telling us about Littlefinger...  All of his previous scenes have already showed us that he's a player in the games and that he has no problem playing dirty so what new were we supposed to learn?For me, this was more about showing his cruelty.  Reading the books, crooked, slimy, and ruthless as we knew him to be, I recall being a bid surprised when we learn later that he's had poor little Jeyne Poole essentially sold into sex slavery.  Doesn't ADwD mention her having scars from being whipped repeatedly or something to that effect?
84	J_Crews	2012-04-09	Was that Rahkaro? I think I heard the woman screamed Quohollo.The subtitles of Dany speaking said Rakharo.
85	SI Monster	2012-04-09	I just finished watching, thank the gods for the DVR.First and foremost, the changes: Bronn for watch commander, I'm not mad at. It keeps him in the show as opposed to Bywater who ends up a one-off. And lets be honest, Bronn for president after Obama.Casting: I don't have an issue with Saan being black. Someone once said they didn't like him being from Lyse and being black. Think about it, he's a pirate, all becasue he said that's where he's from doesn't me he is. Yara/Asha Im' not mad at either, who said she had to be a beauty queen? But the excessive finger play from Theon knowing the truth... I'd like to change the subject.*Extra content* With this I mean the stuff not in the book. Stannis and Mel getting frisky toghether was often guessed at and rumored in the book, but to see it done in such a high handed and fankly distrubing way will keep me from sleeping soundly at night. I really think it was gratuitous like Renly/Loras last season. Also I think the scene between Roz and Littlefinger was the showrunners way of handing him his balls back after Cercei girlified him last episode. Overall, I dug the episode. Everything from watching Yoren establish dominance to the gold cloak to the final confrentation between Cercei and Tyrion. It was a good time, no beer required.
86	SI Monster	2012-04-09	Yet, in the book, she squeezed his package, like, 4 times, and nobody is saying anything about that. Truth be told, while I was reading, I was saying to myself he will never be able to stop washing those hands when he finds out this chick's his sister. She, however, has no excuse. That was so wrong.
87	Fryie	2012-04-09	Ah, and also, say what you will about the Dragonstone scenes, but the visual composition is just brilliant. Fiery Melisandre standing before the Painted Table, behind her only the darkness of the night...
That's enough to make me shiver, more than any dialogue.
88	Qhorin Halfhand and Yoren	2012-04-09	Regarding Melisandre and Stannis, I wouldn't mind them having a sex scene eventually but not  before Stannis receives any proper development or in this way.  The lusty tv show Stannis comes off as a weaker character than the book Stannis who I also assume had sex with Melisandre. (and yes I think lust eventually became a more important part of their relationship, perhaps early on there was some, but not the way tv show Stannis reacted.)
Overall, Stannis character development is weak in the tv show, the viewers don't get a sufficiently strong sense of who Stannis is. His very strong opposition to brothels in the books, how incredibly determined and stubborn he is, how big of grudges he holds (him whining about Robert time and time again in the books, and how he treated him and how he trated Renly) , and other stuff, tv show Stannis just isn't sufficiently good character to me, so far. He has changed, and not in a good way which is disappointing because Stannis was a rather good character in the books. And even with the time constraints they have with only ten episodes, I think they could have done a better job, especially since they have time for that Ros scene.

89	Lord of Cheese	2012-04-09	I didnt like Jon+Craster ending. Stop changing the story D&D!!! GRRM is a much better story teller than the both of you put together on your best day and improved by x10. Let the books guide the story!
Hated Roz and the brothel scenes. She will serve no purpose in the story (better not). There is no way in hell she can be a fake Arya.
Rhakaro getting killed off was stupid, but more forgivable than the others things.
Im starting to find im forgetting the details of the books as i only read them once. But i dont recall Joff ordering the killings.
Greyjoys were done ok. I thought Asha was not how i imagined. She looks too 'soft'. Certainly not the sort who commands her ship and kills men and throws axes. How do they think she is going to manage the Kingsmoot scene?
I rated it a 9 in the other poll thread but after a while of thinking about it i have changed my mind... it should be a 7.
90	CloudFlare	2012-04-09	It starts out with him spying on his whores...are his whores his spies?...then turns disgusting when he wipes semen from a whores mouth and then watches her kiss a patron with that same mouth then he goes on to threaten Ros.  All of his previous scenes have already showed us that he's a player in the games and that he has no problem playing dirty so what new were we supposed to learn?I think LF's spying on spies was to show how how convoluted King's Landing politics really are. I'm sure his whores spy for him. The semen scene(as disgusting as it was) showed that LF can think on his feet and, ahem, keeps his customers happy. He got to where he is today on his smarts, not a sincecure from a lord. You know that from the books, but the casual viewer doesn't.
91	Knight of Ashes	2012-04-09	Yeah TV Joffrey is older and somewhat less naive than book Joffrey and it does come of as believable. I don't have a problem with that change, I also liked how they made us wonder who was behind it, until of course it was revealedI'm quite grateful for some of the changes; I could do without two exact versions of Cersei and Joffrey running around.PS  What the hell are warning points and why don't I have any of them?

She, however, has no excuse. That was so wrong.What I meant was everybody is disgusted by him touching her, but she did it to him in the book... numerous times, once even at the feast AFTER being revealed as his sister.
93	CloudFlare	2012-04-09	Regarding Melisandre and Stannis, I wouldn't mind them having a sex scene eventually but not  before Stannis receives any proper development or in this way.

He's not physically impressive, particularly compared to the actor portraying Davos.
94	Qhorin Halfhand and Yoren	2012-04-09	Same feelings here. I just don't get the sense of 'iron' from TV Stannis. He's not physically impressive, particularly compared to the actor portraying Davos.Yep. Also I agree with this:- Mel promising Stannis a son. This doesn't jive with me. I'm fine with them fucking since it obviously happened in the books, but Stannis wanting to father a bastard boy makes zero sense.
95	DannySpud	2012-04-09	Where does the title come from? I didn't catch the reference when I watched the episode.
96	TheEvilKing	2012-04-09	Just to get it out there, I think the killing of Rakharo was due to the actors schedule, not the producers wanting to kill off a character who lives through the books.Just wanted to quote this for anyone who missed it.
97	Knight of Ashes	2012-04-09	Same feelings here. I just don't get the sense of 'iron' from TV Stannis. He's not physically impressive, particularly compared to the actor portraying Davos.When I first saw TV Stannis, the first thought that came to my mind was that he looked like a young Alastair Sims portraying Scrooge.
98	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2012-04-09	So did they just get rid of Shireen? I heard Mel say something about Stannis only having still borns.
99	DannySpud	2012-04-09	So did they just get rid of Shireen? I heard Mel say something about Stannis only having still borns.Still possible she meant stillborn sons, but I think it's probable Shireen's not going to be in.
100	Odie Wan Kenodie	2012-04-09	I'm yet another who does not like TV Stannis. TV Stannis is not steel, he is soft lead that melts in Mel's hands. He doesn't even look like Stannis.
101	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2012-04-09	Well that kinda sucks, I like Shireen. But I geuss it could later be revealed that she means no sons.
I liked the episode,Ghost looked great and I really liked the end of the episode.Arya and Gendry was awesome.Jaqen was great. I  thought the Mel/Stannis scene was pretty good too.Even though they don't do it in the book, it's heavily implied.
102	J_Crews	2012-04-09	... I'm fine with them fucking since it obviously happened in the books, but Stannis wanting to father a bastard boy makes zero sense.Any King can legitimize a bastard by decree.  Somebody -- Lady Mormont, I think -- is currently holding such a decree Robb wrote legitimizing Jon and naming him his heir, and Stannis offers to do the same and name Jon Lord of Winterfell.  Also, a previous Taergarian king legitimized all his bastards on his deathbed.  This correlates in the real world as well; I'm pretty sure Henry VIII fathered a bastard who was to be his heir, but died before reaching adulthood.
103	BlackTalon	2012-04-09	1. I  can't remember any instance in the books where it is definitely confirmed that Cersei ordered the killings.2. Replacing Slynt with Bronn instead of Swann is a brilliant way of highlighting Tyrion's hypocrisy.1.: It is made implicitly clear, at some point later on Tyrion refers to it as "CerseiÂ´s savage course"2.: Swann? He initially replaced Slynt with Jacely Bywater who is respected as an honorable man by everyone.
104	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2012-04-09	Am I getting things mixed up or does Bronn become City Watch leader sometime down the road anyway? I like that they kept Bronn's line in, makes Tyrion have a good"crap" moment.
105	J_Crews	2012-04-09	Swann? He initially replaced Slynt with Jacely Bywater who is respected as an honorable man by everyone.Correct, and then the Gold Cloaks are given to Ser Addam Marbrand after Bywater's death.  Ser Balon Swann replaces Ser Preston Greenfield on the Kingsguard.
106	Knight of Ashes	2012-04-09	1.: It is made implicitly clear, at some point later on Tyrion refers to it as "CerseiÂ´s savage course"Not that I feel all that strongly as to who ordered what, but Tyrion also thought that Cersei ordered Ser who'snameIkeepforgetting to kill him, but yeah, I believed (and still do) that Book Cersei ordered the killings.  I don't think Book Joff would do so since he's so fucking clueless, he probably doesn't know how babies are made.
107	J_Crews	2012-04-09	Am I getting things mixed up or does Bronn become City Watch leader sometime down the road anyway? I like that they kept Bronn's line in, makes Tyrion have a good"crap" moment.No, but he wears the City Watch's black ringmail uniform all throughout ACoK.  He is eventually knighted, marries into a noble house, and then murders his way into basically being a lord.

109	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2012-04-09	Just to get it out there, I think the killing of Rakharo was due to the actors schedule, not the producers wanting to kill off a character who lives through the books.All of the people who were "wrongly" predicting a romance between Dany and Rakharo and Ros taking the place of Arya, heads must be spinning by now.
110	Robbed Stark	2012-04-09	my problem with craster doming Jon is.. wheres Ghost??I was thinking the same when it happened.  I have a feeling ghost will be there next week to stop the killing blow.Was that really Edd?  I thought that was the cook, Three Fingered Hobbs.. or did he have more fingers?

112	prof talc	2012-04-09	Anyone else think Asha/Yara looks like Russell Crowe?
Liked Gilly and Jaqen a lot. Davos too. 
When Sam and Gilly met I got this immediate flash montage in my mind of everything they go through throughout the rest of the books, with the baby, being on the ship, the crying, the sex. It reminded me of the scene from the OC when they flash back to Marisa and Ryan meeting at the top of the driveway in the first episode. It might have gotten a little dusty in my apartment...
Someone may have mentioned this, but, no Damphair?
113	teemo	2012-04-09	I actually liked this episode, even though a lot of things bugged me.  I think it was the scenes at Pyke.  I REALLY loved the interaction between Theon and Balon.  It was almost word for word, IIRC, and Balon was cast perfect.  He is just exactly what I pictured.  Asha (I refuse to call her Yara) is not what I pictured, but I'm okay with her.  Is she chubby, or just really fit and that's muscles?  I can't tell.  Loved those scenes though.  I wish Asha could have gone on a little longer with the Esgred thing, but yeah I know...impossible.Not getting the Craster/Jon thing.  What are the chances anyway that Jon would just conveniently be there while one of the girls just had a son and Craster happens to be near Jon sacrificing one?  That was just odd, and not a very captivating cliffhanger for the book reader, since you know, it didn't happen.  I am NOT a fan of the Meli/Stannis scene at all.  I don't mind a sex scene since I'm pretty sure it happened, but like THAT?  She was talking down on Selyse, when Selyse is one of her most fervent supporters.  Here she is just a confined weak woman in a tower that never had a child. OK.  And Stannis with his whole ".....sons??" line.  I don't know about that.  Why does Stannis want a bastard son?  I thought he was under the impression that sex was for her magic and shadow babies.  But maybe I am totally off the mark here.  And I think that comparing this to Renly/Loras is not really fair.  Renly and Loras were obviously madly in love, and nothing in the book suggests that of Stannis and Meli.Dany.  Well.  Boring.  I guess they are now resorting to just killing random people off since there's nothing too exciting going on with her.  I don't know where they are going with this crazy idea that Joff had anything to do with killing the bastards, because that is not the Joffrey I know from the books.  Are they trying to make Cersei more likable or something?  I don't even know how that could be possible.I'm also sick of Ros being the only thing as a plot device to understand LF's character.  He deserves better than that.Love Arya's scenes!!  I want to see her walk with the Mountain and Tickler soooooo bad.

114	Gertrude	2012-04-09	I love the moment where Sam saves Gilly from Ghost and she tells him he is very brave. You can just about see Sam giving his heart up right then. It also shows how she would find him attractive. I have to admit, in the books it makes logical sense - she sees him as a protector, but I never really felt it.
I love Edd and Grenn's conversation. I like the Night Watch secondary characters even more on screen.
I totally understand Bronn being the Commander of the Goldcloaks, but my gut reaction was meh. In the books he was totally loyal to and dependant on Tyrion. His knighting and marriage was like a punch in the gut because it was yet another blow for Tyrion when things went to shit. I realize that Tyrion appointed him and can reasonably still count on him to be on his side, but Bronn is more independent now. But like i said, I can easily see how they made this decision and i still have my books. I can just pick and chose which bits of the series I want to incorporate into my personal canon.
Gonna echo that Heady really didn't do it for me last season, but so far this season I have really come to like her in the role. It's possible that it's because she's playing off Tyrion, and those two are gold together.
115	Knight of Ashes	2012-04-09	Someone may have mentioned this, but, no Damphair?No Wex either (Whom I've always thought of as Porky Pig to Theon's Daffy Duck).
116	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2012-04-09	All of the people who were "wrongly" predicting a romance between Dany and Rakharo and Ros taking the place of Arya, heads must be spinning by now.I was actually thinking they could make Ros take the place of Jeyne when she is sent off to Ramsay. Even though I wouldn't nessacerily "like it" they haven't cast Jeyne and they could have Theon recognize her like he does Jeyne.
117	Gertrude	2012-04-09	Am I getting things mixed up or does Bronn become City Watch leader sometime down the road anyway? I like that they kept Bronn's line in, makes Tyrion have a good"crap" moment.I believe Tyrion does make him captain of his personal guard that Bronn recruited for him. That may be what you're thinking of.
118	DannySpud	2012-04-09	Someone may have mentioned this, but, no Damphair?Is Damphair the Drowned God uncle priest guy? Because I swear I've seen him in a promo at some point.I was thinking the same when it happened.  I have a feeling ghost will be there next week to stop the killing blow.The wolves don't seem to be so "magic" as they are in the books. Book-ghost would have silently ripped Craster's arm off before he got anywhere near hitting Jon. I guess it's because the wolves can't be as omnipresent as in the books because of budget limitations, but its still a shame.
119	teemo	2012-04-09	I was actually thinking they could make Ros take the place of Jeyne when she is sent off to Ramsay. But how on earth can a woman in her 30s take the place of a girl that is 14 and looks even younger??

Ros could definitely not pass as Arya, she is played by a 30 year old woman, Arya by a 15 year old girl. Seriously, why does this come up so much? There is absolutely no way this will happen. No way. None. On a scale of possibility this is on par with the show resurrecting Ned and having him dance with Lady and a weirwood tree on the moon. This will not happen.
121	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2012-04-09	But how on earth can a woman in her 30s take the place of a girl that is 14 and looks even younger??IDK it just ran across my head one time. It would be kinda weird when Theon starts to carry her, since he's not supposed to be very strong.

I didn't picture him as black either but he played it perfectly.Criticisms of Ros - well, who gives a f***, Ros is only there so we had a segue into a 'remember audience, Littlefinger is a ruthless, calculating badass' scene.Viewers who haven't read the books are going to FREAK the fuck out when it's revealed Littlefinger is behind Sansa/Joff etc. UNLESS it's established early that a) he has a motive (Cersei being a bitch) and /cool.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='B)' /> is ruthless enough to and capable of executing such a convoluted conspiracy against the crown....

I don't understand how people can come up with that scenario and claim to have read the books? I suppose reading and comprehending are two different things.
126	teemo	2012-04-09	Yeah, who cares that he's black?  He's exactly how I pictured, except quite a bit less elaborately dressed.

130	BlackTalon	2012-04-09	I think we saw Jeyne Poole sitting beside Sansa during the feast at Winterfell ... no way Roz will replace her, who on earth came up with that...
Btw I quite liked TV Yara, book Asha may have made all the fangirls happy but she was never a very believable character, IMHO. And I seriously hope I will never ever have to read about her pulling her dirk from her bodice and calling it her suckling babe again, Jesus Christ...

The whole purpose for Chataya and Alayaya was to cover him visiting Shae by making it look like he was just frequenting a brothel, rather than having brought Shae with him to court after having been explicitly forbidden to do so by Daddy Warbucks... err... Lannister.

135	HyacinthGirl	2012-04-09	I really, really liked the episode! But then I'm not one of the readers who delight in playing spot the difference between the books & show. "*Screech*, they changed the hair colour of a minor character! How DARE they butcher my favourite books!" Please. It's getting boring.
-I liked Asha/Yara. I think the actress was spot on. I'm not a Greyjoy fan, but the sets and actors were amazing, so it was very well done.
-Arya and Gendry had some great interactions, and I really don't mind that her revelation has been moved forward. Their friendship will be more interesting to watch this way. LOMMY WANTS TO YIELD! Hot Pie is brilliant. And Jaqen was perfect.
-Huh, no Robb/Cat? I suppose the timing didn't work
-OhmyR'hllor, Peter Dinklage just gets better and better. "I'm not questioning your honour, I'm denying its existence." So. Great.
-Liam Cunningham is definitely doing Davos justice. I like him a lot, and it was good to see Salador Saan (why are people complaining that he's black? You're as bad as the Hunger Games fans who had a hissy fit over Rue being black. Sheesh.). I think there are some Stan Fans who think his sex scene was all wrong, and I don't quite see where they're coming from, but hey, I'm not a die hard Stannis loyalist. I think that scene went pretty much as it would have if it were in the books. You might not want your noble, just, honourable king cheating on his wife with a creepy/sexy priestess, but he did, so...
-Forgot about Dany. So Rakharro did die. Damn. He was pretty. Poor Irri. Why did the actor have to leave the show? WHY WOULD HE WANT TO LEAVE THE SHOW?! But I think his death was a good move: instead of all of Dany's bloodriders returning to her, we get reminded that she is in a very bad position in a very dangerous place.
-The Jon scenes were the highlight of the episode. Some NW banter about milkmaids, we finally see Ghost in the fist time in ages, and I love Sam! But the last scene was amazing. I don't care that it wasn't in the books, I wish it had been, it was a great scene! Typical Jon running into the woods like a hero, creepy Craster, and now we know for sure what he does with the boys. It was a superb addition because the audience sees the Others, who we haven't seen in a while, are still very much around and scary.
Jon's gonna be in trouble....

136	J_Crews	2012-04-09	Yeah, she'll be out of there soon, I think.Hope so.  That'll make it make more sense.
137	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2012-04-09	I've got a question.  The others haven't been seen for 8,000 years, yet Craster is giving his sons to them and has presumbly been doing so for years.  Were they just waiting till they had enough of Craster's sons to create an army?  The rangers have been visiting Craster for years but only now the others are going after everyone.They have an endless supply of Wildlings and a few giants.
138	DannySpud	2012-04-09	So, you do not foresee Tyrion moving Shae out of the RK, being that Lord Varys commented that Tyrion was not supposed to bring her?I guess that's actually quite likely. I don't really like show-Shae, her hands of gold moment is shaping up to be nowhere near as tragic as it should be...
139	Knight of Ashes	2012-04-09	Back to Shireen- she provided the first time we heard about grayscale, which will become significant down the road, so maybe she'll show up at some point.

142	J_Crews	2012-04-09	I totally understand Bronn being the Commander of the Goldcloaks, but my gut reaction was meh. In the books he was totally loyal to and dependant on Tyrion. His knighting and marriage was like a punch in the gut because it was yet another blow for Tyrion when things went to shit. I realize that Tyrion appointed him and can reasonably still count on him to be on his side, but Bronn is more independent now. If you think about it, though, Bywater was very much Tyrion's man too.  This way it's just more condenced; removing the need for a whole new actor whose salary would eat up budget dollars and a whole new character for TV fans to try to keep track of.  Also, gives the dude playing Bronn a bigger role.
143	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2012-04-09	I guess that's actually quite likely. I don't really like show-Shae, her hands of gold moment is shaping up to be nowhere near as tragic as it should be...I don't like Shae at all. The actress portrays her exactly like I imagined her, a social climbing, conniving bitch. I'm looking forward the characters demise, although, I think the actress is doing an excellent job.
144	TheEvilKing	2012-04-09	I think they left the option of Shireen open on purpose. They can introduce her down the line if they decide she is too important to leave out.
ETA: There was a nice touch in the scene where the Gold Cloaks come to fetch Gendry. When Yoren has his knife to the dude's thigh, you can see all the Nights Watch recruits slightly out of focus in the background, slowly picking up their weapons and moving towards the Gold Cloaks. I thought that was well done.

146	teemo	2012-04-09	I think they left the option of Shireen open on purpose. They can introduce her down the line if they decide she is too important to leave out.I think that is the best route....but after she said Selyse could give him no sons, didn't she also say something like "only stillborn children?" or just "only stillborns?"
147	Knight of Ashes	2012-04-09	I think they left the option of Shireen open on purpose. They can introduce her down the line if they decide she is too important to leave out.I sure hope so; it's bad enough they left out Theon getting excited over the thought of "Esgred" lactating.
148	Vikingkingq	2012-04-09	I know some people have complained about the Stannis and Melisandre scene, but I think if you pay close attention to what happens in that scene, it plays out exactly as it must have happened:Stannis says that he can't beat 110,000 men with 5,000 men and that he needs Renly's army to win (true)Melisandre replies "I have seen the path to victory in the flames" (true), "but first you must give yourself to the Lord of Light."Stannis thinks she's talking just about his rather...unenthusiastic conversion.Melisandre says "you must give all of yourself." (meaning his shadow)And then she only brings up the son (which is true, she's going to give him a shadowbaby) to get him over the hump of betraying his wife.To me, this perfectly fits the books - Melisandre is just vague enough that Stannis doesn't have to think that he's killing his brother with sorcery, and she couches the conception first and foremost as a requirement of victory based in religion.
149	DannySpud	2012-04-09	I think they left the option of Shireen open on purpose. They can introduce her down the line if they decide she is too important to leave out.Yeah, I felt her only real importance in the books is to introduce us to greyscale, but that's not really important till FfC/DwD (I forget which one...) and can be done by pretty much anyone. Sure there's the technicality of her getting the Iron Throne but does anyone really think that'll happen?I think that is the best route....but after she said Selyse could give him no sons, didn't she also say something like "only stillborn children?" or just "only stillborns?"I think she said "No sons, only stillborns" which could be referring to he's had a daughter, but only stillborn sons, or it could be that he has no children. Can't really tell.
150	teemo	2012-04-09	I sure hope so; it's bad enough they left out Theon getting excited over the thought of "Esgred" lactating.Even though I know how strapped they are time wise, I really wanted to see that fake interaction go on a little bit longer /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />  I thought that was one of the funniest things in the books.

Very good points.  My only thing is that - wouldn't it be sort of confusing to viewers?  Will they be able to see that deeply into her shadowbaby births based on that, or just think it's totally unrelated?  Because as far as I can tell, nothing in that scene hinted at anything but Stannis wanting a son and Meli wanting to give him one.  But I guess later on they could clarify that later, huh.  Anyway, good post.

152	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2012-04-09	I'm yet another who does not like TV Stannis. TV Stannis is not steel, he is soft lead that melts in Mel's hands. He doesn't even look like Stannis.Robert was steel, Renly copper and Stannis iron. Iron doesn't bend, it breaks.
153	Ravenhair	2012-04-09	1.  Asha was irritating as a character in the books when she was first introduced, IMO, but I grew to like her as the series progressed.  The actress cast as Asha did not display her fire or spirit.  
2.  Too bad it was sunny when the Pyke scenes were filmed.  I always pictured Pyke as being perpetually overcast and, well, grey. 
3.  Ok, we know that Stannis and Mel eventually have sex of some sort in the books because of the shadow babies.  The scene tonight was just weird, though, and not a good weird.  The actor portraying Stannis and the writers/directors do nothing to set up the idea that Stannis is shown, initially, to be so brittle that he will break before he bends.  We do not get a sense at all of his unyielding moral compass, which helps show us later his total hypocrisy in the situation with Melisandre. 
4.  First the silver and now Rakharo?!  Wtf, writers/directors?   I understand the rakharo actor was offered another role, but then the show could have done something different than make him a bizarre plot point. 
5.  Why is Sam suddenly a horn dog constantly thinking about and looking at women?  Writers/directors, wtf?
6.  Littlefinger has now been written to be creepy as shit without book littlefinger's intelligence.  So instead of a great game player who is creepy, we get a dip shit who is creepy. 
7.  Loved Arya (Maisie Williams) and Gendry.  Close to the book scenes and great interaction between the two.  Their scene was the highlight of the episode.  Jaqen was excellent for the small time we saw him.  Actor playing Yoren was excellent last season and this season as well.

156	Vikingkingq	2012-04-09	Some more thoughts:1. Jon seeing the Other I think is necessary to remind the audience that the things we saw very briefly in the pilot are still around. I think the show is going to pump up the Other stuff going on by advancing the attack on the Fist of the First Men to the finale of Season 2, and probably adding in some Othery sightings in Season 3 and then show us the Others in action at Hardhome in Season 4.2. Despite my initial fears about Asha/Yara's look, I thought she looked appropriately creepy in the scene with Balon, but I hope we still get to see her bit with the axe and dagger.3. I thought Arya and Gendry were perfect, and Jaqen H'gar was very very good, although I had never thought his name was pronounced that way.4. I don't think it's explicit that Shireen doesn't exist; all Melisandre said was that Selyse had given him only stillborn sons.5. The scene with Littlefinger and Ros creeped me the hell out, especially given the references in last season to his client with a taste for beautiful corpses. /shudder
157	teemo	2012-04-09	5.  Why is Sam suddenly a horn dog constantly thinking about and looking at women?  Writers/directors, wtf?6.  Littlefinger has now been written to be creepy as shit without book littlefinger's intelligence.  So instead of a great game player who is creepy, we get a dip shit who is creepy.Yeah, I recognized the Sam thing too.  That is not very "sam-like" - girls freak him out.  They did this in the first season too I think.  Wasn't he fixated on boobs or something?And yes on LF - he needs a new plot device to replace Ros.
158	Vikingkingq	2012-04-09	This is pretty neat - I never really thought of it like that. Very good points.  My only thing is that - wouldn't it be sort of confusing to viewers?

Anyway, good post.I think it's the reverse - the audience needs to see the shadowbaby conception so that the shadowbaby birth makes sense when it happens later on this season.
159	Odie Wan Kenodie	2012-04-09	For people who are watching it with non-book readers, what are they saying about this episode?  My boyfriend thought it was boring and that nothing really happened.that was what my boyfriend said too. Boring, yawn, snore.

Jaqen was excellent for the small time we saw him.  Actor playing Yoren was excellent last season and this season as well.  1. Sort of agree, but we haven't really seen much yet2. Yeah, with a perpetual light drizzle or mist.3. Disagree. The scene with him writing the letter was a very good introduction to his unyielding moral compass. "A harmless courtesy your Grace." "A lie. Take it out."4. If they stuck to the books Dany would be having a pretty boring season. I'm not really a fan of Dany, she hardly ever does anything after GoT5. I believe they changed his character a bit because the actor they got to play him is so good.6. He needs more verbal battles with Varys to show his intelligence7. Agree, I love Arya and Maisie is easily the best actress on the show, which is amazing for such a young girl.
161	SFA-OK	2012-04-09	For people who are watching it with non-book readers, what are they saying about this episode?  My boyfriend thought it was boring and that nothing really happened.I've read (and am a big fan) of all the books and I thought it was boring! But I've thought the majority of the episodes so far have been fairly boring. For non-book readers I'm curious to know how many of them even know what is really going on with all the different storylines, especially with the way the show constantly jumps from scene to scene with quick bits of information being thrown out here and there.
162	Gertrude	2012-04-09	If you think about it, though, Bywater was very much Tyrion's man too.  This way it's just more condenced; removing the need for a whole new actor whose salary would eat up budget dollars and a whole new character for TV fans to try to keep track of.  Also, gives the dude playing Bronn a bigger role.Like I said, I totally get why they made this decision for the show. It makes sense and Bywater is ultimately a throw-away character. I'd even say it was the right decision for the series. It was a purely emotional reaction, but I'm not one to get up in arms about the differences between the two. I will just remember that that's not really what happened and treasure the book version all the more.
163	Odie Wan Kenodie	2012-04-09	I think they left the option of Shireen open on purpose. They can introduce her down the line if they decide she is too important to leave out. I agree with that.i think it would have been to much to introduce a poor girl with gray scale and explain it while everyone else on Dragonstone shall be introduced.
164	malek	2012-04-09	I know some people have complained about the Stannis and Melisandre scene, but I think if you pay close attention to what happens in that scene, it plays out exactly as it must have happened:Stannis says that he can't beat 110,000 men with 5,000 men and that he needs Renly's army to win (true)Melisandre replies "I have seen the path to victory in the flames" (true), "but first you must give yourself to the Lord of Light."Stannis thinks she's talking just about his rather...unenthusiastic conversion.Melisandre says "you must give all of yourself."

Hmmm...One more thing. Ever since series got green light I hoped for just one thing, that little exchange between Tyrion and Bronn. In my opinion these are the best lines in series, and I'm so happy I've heard them on TV. Though Flynn could have delivered it better, certainly with a fingers rubbing gesture.
165	FiveByeSeven	2012-04-09	Hey folks. Just dropping by with news that the title of the Season 2 finale's already been revealed!And they've saved the best possible title this season for the finale!
	Spoiler Valar Morghulis
166	LuisDantas	2012-04-09	6. Atheist Davos and Saan.  Davos isn't a religious man, but he still keeps the Seven, and Saan keeps the Lord of Light.  Making them irreligious is fine, but atheism doesn't really fit the setting at all.I can't think of a reason why it would not fit, personally.  I think you are overestimating the differences in cultural mindset between the middle ages and these days.  If anything, people back then would be more aware of how optional belief in deities actually is.
167	Ran	2012-04-09	It's clear Stannis has slept with Melisandre in the novels -- the shadow she gives birth to is his shadow! -- but it's quite subtle.
168	FiveByeSeven	2012-04-09	I think they left the option of Shireen open on purpose. They can introduce her down the line if they decide she is too important to leave out.I listened closely to that bit, and it seems like that statement was deliberately left ambiguous. It did not confirm nor deny that Stannis has a female child.
169	Qhorin Halfhand and Yoren	2012-04-09	It's clear Stannis has slept with Melisandre in the novels -- the shadow she gives birth to is his shadow! -- but it's quite subtle.I agree that Stannis sleeps with Melisandre in the novels, but did you find that scene acceptable and in general Stannis portrayal acceptable? I think they should have showed Stannis differently in the show than they did and also provided more character development for him.Stannis in the books is Iron willed, very determined, has a very strong sense of believing in his moral code, has strong feelings of bitterness. And also he does not seem as lust obsessed (or obsessed about Melisandre giving his a son) as show Stannis. I don't think the tv show was very successful with its portrayal of Stannis.

170	IceVyper	2012-04-09	I haven't read all the comments, so someone may have already said that:
At first I was pissed at the cliffhanger in the end but now a week has passed since I saw the preview and I have my ideas.
*Ghost was not arround when it happened but he may just appear seconds after Jon gets hit.
*They need to have Jon hurt and passed out so that he can start experiencing his warging abilities. They need to explain how it happens because the audience won't buy it if Jon gets to sleep one night and then becomes a skinchanger.
I really can't wait to see next weeks episode.
The Arya scenes were just amazing, love her whole adventure.
I still think that the brothel scenes are just a waste of time but it seems like they are there to stay.
I am curious to see who will be Dany's main bloodrider now.
171	Rockroi	2012-04-09	It's clear Stannis has slept with Melisandre in the novels -- the shadow she gives birth to is his shadow! -- but it's quite subtle.But when you are dealing with Magic its always ambiguous.  Magic does not have a mathmatical outcome; merely because Mel's shadow-baby wore Stannis' face does not necessarily equal that Stannis had intercourse with her.  It may be that Mel performed a ritual on Stannis that made his desires manifest.  Maybe his shadow was something Mel did because Mel desires Stannis.  Again, Magic does not have mathmatical rules, therefore you cannot say that the books are "clear" that they had sex.At the same time, its implied.  Not just the shadow baby but Stannis' distopia when he's not around Mel; Mel's followers being ID'd as "Queens Men." But even there we have problems.  When Asha encounters Stannis in DwD she states emphatically that Stannis is the type of man who think of women as a nother species; in the books Stannis' sexual desires dont just seem muted, they seem all but removed from him- from his homely wife the stories of him having sex once  a year. I'm not saying that they did not have sex (it seems generally more likley than not that they did, if only because ... well... because men like attractive women).  But "clear?"  Not really.
172	Vikingkingq	2012-04-09	I agree that Stannis sleeps with Melisandre in the novels, but did you find that scene acceptable and in general Stannis portrayal acceptable? I think they should have showed Stannis differently in the show than they did and also provided more character development for him.Stannis in the books is Iron willed, very determined, has a very strong sense of believing in his moral code, has strong feelings of bitterness. And also he does not seem as lust obsessed (or obsessed about Melisandre giving his a son) as show Stannis. I don't think the tv show was very successful with its portrayal of Stannis.How is what we saw different from the book? Stannis isn't acting out of lust (rewatch the scene; the moment Melisandre disrobes, Stannis moves to put a damn table debtween them) - Melisandre says here's how you're going to win, and then tells him she'll give him a son to get him past his marriage vows. Look, as Ran points out this sex act had to happen. And what we saw was something that was couched in terms of duty and a reluctantly embraced religion and a huge amount of awkwardness. That's Stannis!
173	Vikingkingq	2012-04-09	But when you are dealing with Magic its always ambiguous.

Again, Magic does not have mathmatical rules, therefore you cannot say that the books are "clear" that they had sex.Ambiguous? Melisandre is quite explicit about it in Dance With Dragons. She had sex with Stannis in order to give birth to a shadowbaby, and likely it happened because she said this is how R'hllor will give you victory, and Stannis went to it "like a man marching off to battle," which is perfectly in keeping with his character.
174	Ran	2012-04-09	It certainly very hasty, I'll grant you that. But we don't really know what motivates Stannis to sleep with her in the novel, so I suppose the whispered promise of a son might be all it takes. It does make me wonder how they'll deal with it when a son isn't exactly forthcoming -- not the sort of son Stannis imagined he'd get, anyways.
Melisandre has been explicit in ASoS that she births her shadows by sleeping with Stannis -- she tries to get Davos to sleep with her because Stannis's energies are depleted, so to speak. And yes, ADwD makes it even clearer.

175	Inigo Montoya the Second	2012-04-09	For people who are watching it with non-book readers, what are they saying about this episode?  My boyfriend thought it was boring and that nothing really happened.my mom was worried that the greyjoys were just going to have their own separate plot but i hinted that they tie into one of the stark children and straight up told her about vic/dany. that's years away, if the show even lasts that long.yeah, it was boring. i love the series but i don't think they need a 3rd "exposition" episode. i don't see why they can't start moving everything along next sunday. (or if we're lucky episode 3 show up early on xbox too! /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />)
176	Ran	2012-04-09	Oh, and something I've wondered between screener and final episode: did they keep the order of Theon with the captain's daughter, and then the brothel scene? I thought that was a very poor editing decision.
177	Ser Bunkster	2012-04-09	The actor that plays Rakharo got a better gig, that's why they killed him off IIRC.he got a part in Brad Pitt movie World War Z
178	David Selig	2012-04-09	Oh, and something I've wondered between screener and final episode: did they keep the order of Theon with the captain's daughter, and then the brothel scene? Yes, they kept it.
179	Ser Greguh	2012-04-09	People really didn't get that Stannis fucked Melisandre in the books?  I didn't think it could possibly be more clear.  WTF.  Seriously.
180	Greywolf2375	2012-04-09	"I'm the most strict and honorable man in Westeros.  Wait, I can have a son??  Lets get it ON!!"  Thumbs down.
I'm fine with speeding up story lines,but wasn't too happy about them announcing "Hey, we're here for that guy"
Loved Saan & Davos - the changes to Davos not being a follower of the 7, meh.
Varys did not come across nearly as sly & slippery with Shae as he should have.
Ros/LF...we need to see what he is watching why?  making sure his investments are safe...ok...but beyond that, meh.  Fine, he doesn't like bad investments & gives Ros the threat...but why was any of the scene necessary?
The whole ending scene with Jon/birth/Craster.  Yeah, not a fan.
Rakharo being beheaded?  not a fan.
I'm trying to watch this like I watched the LOTR movies - I know there are changes, there have to be changes.  This will not be the book - and that is fine...good even in some regards.  As just a TV show, I'm enjoying it - even though there are some gaps that need better explanation.  As an adaption of the book series, the first two episodes of this season have not engaged me like any of last seasons did.
181	Greywolf2375	2012-04-09	How is what we saw different from the book? Stannis isn't acting out of lust (rewatch the scene; the moment Melisandre disrobes, Stannis moves to put a damn table debtween them) - Melisandre says here's how you're going to win, and then tells him she'll give him a son to get him past his marriage vows. Look, as Ran points out this sex act had to happen. And what we saw was something that was couched in terms of duty and a reluctantly embraced religion and a huge amount of awkwardness. That's Stannis!Stannis is all about breaking his word and cheating on his wife?  Stannis is by the book - him jumping on Melisandre when she throws out the word "son" is not what Stannis in the book is about.  "Proper" is what defines him, that act was not proper based on the information they have given in the show.
182	Lord of the Night	2012-04-09	Damn fine episode.What I liked...-Jon and the Other. This was a fantastic scene that really makes you realise what the Night's Watch is walking into. Its not just Wildings and Mance Rayder and that dick Craster that live out here, there really are monsters in the woods. And as in the books its an interesting possibility as to how the Others are born.-Tyrion: Period. Tyrion is awesome and owns in every scene he is present in. His friendly dinner with Janos Slynt was his highlight scene, I do wish that he had invoked Tywin's name and made Slynt cower like he did in the book. But of course, "You should have stopped at Imp!" is fantastic.-Yoren taking a hundred levels in badass with the Gold Cloaks. This scene had me laughing with how awesome Yoren was, and he took the guy's sword. Also enjoying Arya and Gendry, these two are a great pair that I hope we see more of in the books as well as the TV show.-Balon Greyjoy. I was ambivalent to this character in the books, albeit I pictured him differently and wrongly, but his actor really pulled it off. Balon seems cool, and I liked the way he smacked Theon down for his stockholm syndrome with the Starks.-Davos and Salladhor. These two were great together, absolutely loved Salladhor's plans for Cersei and Davos later saying that Salladhor is indeed his friend, so of course he's never trusted him.What I was ambivalent to...-Daenerys. Things haven't yet picked up so Dany's story isn't a highlight.-Stannis and Melisandre. I had no doubt in the books that Melisandre was sleeping with Stannis after she offered to sleep with Davos and talked about heartfires, and that Stannis's was weak from being used. Obviously she bedded him to have that shadow. So I think the scene was necessary to explain it to the audience. Stannis himself needs to get to a scene where he can really show the iron core that makes him who he is, and Melisandre needs to get to one of her darker scenes to show who she really is.-Ros and Littlefinger. I do not hate or like Ros, I just don't find her character interesting. That said, Littlefinger scared the hell out of me with that story of his. If anyone needed confirmation he's capable of doing horrible things, selling some poor whore-slave to likely be tortured and disfigured is all the proof you need.What I didn't like...-Cersei. Too much attempts are being made to make her sympathetic to the audience. She ordered the killing of the bastards in the book and that is how it should have stayed.-Yara Greyjoy. I absolutely DO NOT mean the actress, she's great. I hate the name change to Yara. Asha Greyjoy and Osha are different names and hardly confusing, and does it even matter since Osha is leaving at the end of this season?... she is leaving I hope. And that they are not going to change it to keep her around.Also on a side-note. Is anyone else worried that Ramsay Bolton hasn't been cast yet, or the Reeds? These characters are vital to the stories for Bran and Theon, and in Ramsay's case much of ADwD and the following books. Episode 8 is titled The Prince of Winterfell, so hopefully we'll see "Reek" then, or hear about him beforehand.LotN
183	DarkSnow	2012-04-09	What will happen between Jon and Craster surely that changes the story alot. i like the loyalty the first season had to the books but having changes make it a lot more exciting. but it they change too much now how will next season follow if the scenes are cut from this season.
184	Flayed Starkman	2012-04-09	Time for me to jump on the "Forum of Ice and Fire" train.
I didn't particularly dislike this episode, but I disliked the changes more than in episode 1.
I don't really see why they should have inserted that Jon/Craster ending, because it creates an artificial conflict, and God knows how they'll handle it in the next episode. But non-book viewers probably needed to be reminded that the Others exist and all that.
Bronn becoming Captain of the City Watch was OK, because a new character would only take up space.
Rakharo should not have been killed off, but if there are scheduling conflicts, what are you gonna do?
But the most grave "sin" the writers have commited in this episode is combining Shireen and Selyse, which I think is totally bonkers. I mean, they could have mentioned Shireen without showing her, although I kinda have been waiting to see what the greyscale looks like. 
But in spite of all this, I thought it was an OK episode.
185	Lany Cassandra	2012-04-09	I don't really get upset about things being different in the tv show from the books UNLESS I think it affects the story line:totally understand Bronn being the Commander of the Goldcloaks, but my gut reaction was meh. In the books he was totally loyal to and dependant on Tyrion. His knighting and marriage was like a punch in the gut because it was yet another blow for Tyrion when things went to shit. I realize that Tyrion appointed him and can reasonably still count on him to be on his side, but Bronn is more independent now.This is the problem I had too.  I guess we have to wait and see if this makes Bronn's betrayal easier or harder to believe.I also thought Mel "seduced" Stanis in his sleep (maybe with him subcounsiously aware of it) and that "he always does what is right".  Having sex just at the promise of a son seems to lesson his character and his strength.I had mistakenly thought it was Gilly already having the baby boy, but since it wasn't I am not as bothered by that change.Didn't care for the Ros scene, but someone showed me what was posted on another board and this makes a lot sense (in addition to the LF is a cold hearted bastard:I know I'm a minority as a Ros fan. But I like the character and I like the scene. To me, its importance was to show a contrast between Ros and the other characters. A innocent baby is killed. We get the following reactions:1. Joff--ordered it to happen, so obviously he didn't care2. Cersei--deemed it what was necessary3. Tyrion--is concerned about the political ramifications of the Lannister name being tied to infanticide4. Janos--was just taking order, no remorse5. Bronn--would've done it if the money is right6. Littlefinger--you get one night to grieve over a dead baby; get over it or I'll see you to a sexual sadistAll of these rich, powerful, conncted people don't give two shis about Barra. The one person who does care? A whore, someone every single person on this list would look down on except for Bronn. Powerful commentary in my opinion.Definately an interesting POV  (thanks Mya)Not sure I liked that Jeoff ordered it, but he is older and nastier in the tv show, so I guess I can live with it.As far as Shireen and Rhoko go, don't care all at.  As far as I can see they are not part of the plot lineeta:  I should add that I did really like the rest of the show. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

186	duncanthemedium	2012-04-09	2. Replacing Slynt with Bronn instead of Swann is a brilliant way of highlighting Tyrion's hypocrisy.Jacelyn Bywater you mean...
187	hoelk	2012-04-09	I didn't have a problem with Stannis banging Mel on screen, BUT how the scene was arranged was somewhat ridiculous and inflicted major damage to Stanni's cool. He should have been much more reluctant about it, in a non-passionate quickly-perform-his-duty kinda way (which would have been even more awesome because of how eyefriendly Mel actually is)

188	Princess Peach	2012-04-09	he got a part in Brad Pitt movie World War ZThey could have got someone else to play his part.  It's not like anyone would really notice the actor change that much, he really wasn't that memorable in season 1.  They just used the opportunity to make it look like something has happened in the Dany storyline.
189	Ser Bunkster	2012-04-09	2 small things that I loved:
When Davos and Saan are walking on the beach, look at the shape of the island in the background, its shaped like a dragon and looks cool as fuck.
As Vayrs goes to leave the tower of the hand, Tyrion puts his hand against the door to stop him opening it.but when Tyrion goes to open it Varys puts 1 finger against the door to stop him. just thought that was a lovely touch to show that Vayrs thinks he is stronger/more powerful than Tyrion.
190	Ran	2012-04-09	GRRM has noted that American audiences are particularly unwelcoming to casting changes during a show. I think people would have been annoyed by someone else being called Rakharo. And, truth be told, I think he did leave a memorable presence -- Elyes Gabel's got a lot of charisma, and he sold that Dothraki language like no one else -- and a recasting would stick out like a sore thumb.That's a nice point about the hypocrisy of Tyrion, by replacing Joff's baby-killer Slynt with his own baby-killer-if-I-get-paid Bronn. Obviously, the idea of an illiterate, lowborn scumbag like Bronn being able to run the Watch is kind of silly -- it's a police force, you can't just get any old guy off the street to run an organization that has its own logistics and bureaucracy -- but we can suspend disbelief because it was really pretty clever as a way of cutting out Bywater and streamlining the story a bit.Lets just hope this doesn't mean Bronn meets Bywater's fate at the Blackwater. Jerome Flynn has been terrific.Oh, and if you haven't rated the episode yet, please do so!Bunkster,Yeah, the dragon statues are cool and a nice reminder of the Valyrians.I haven't had a chance to say here -- though I did in our episode coverage -- that I was really looking forward to Lucian Msamati on the show. I loved his performance in The No. 1 Lady's Detective Agency, and knew he'd do great with this role. He did. And as I note, it looks like they've gone with the notion that he's adopted Lys as his home port, but he's not originally from here -- episode 4 should make that clearer, I think, in an indirect way.

191	sharkhawk	2012-04-09	Theory about Ros crying. 
Robert visited Winterfell.  We know what a horndog he is.  He visited the winter village  brothel.
He liked Ros, visited her in LF brothel.
Everyones commented on how heavy Ros looks. 
Maybe Gendry (and Edric) aren't the only bastards left.
192	Howland Reed	2012-04-09	I thought it was pretty decent.  Besides what everyone has been saying, but we knew they were going to make changes.  I thought Rorge and Biter were pretty m'eh.  I imagined them so much more intimidating, bigger, scarier.

193	Grunkins	2012-04-09	And many liberties shall be taken!
Good episode.  More Arya is always for the better.  Not sure how keen I was on overt Mel and Stannis getting it on, but I'll never turn down nudity.  Enough Ros.  Did Theon smell his finger afterward?  Because that would make it dirtier.  Pike was perfect.  Saan was good.  Davos is a pimp.  I'm not sure if it gets points added or deducted for Littlefinger wiping the semen off the girls mouth before she made out with the outraged client.  A little Renly might have been nice.  Cersei good as always.  Jon's dead!
(yay, the site is working again)
194	dtones520	2012-04-09	They could have got someone else to play his part.  It's not like anyone would really notice the actor change that much, he really wasn't that memorable in season 1.  They just used the opportunity to make it look like something has happened in the Dany storyline.Instead they got an actor, the guy playing Kovarro (name change, I know), who sounds like he is going to be the bloodrider we are going to see in Dany's story.  They will add a 3rd one, but just with some random guy like they did with Aggo.  I'd rather them kill off the one to give Dany's story some meat than just change the actor for a middle of the pact role.  Its not like giving her a new Bloodrider with a different name really makes her story any different.  As long as you have one to potentially get tossed over some walls in a trebuchet later on.
195	Auska	2012-04-09	I'm sure Jon's not dead! He probably warged.
Waitâ<U+0080>¦
196	Roose Seal	2012-04-09	I thought it was a great episode. -Don't mind the changes, streamlining the plot is a necessity at this point. -Cersei/Tyrion is always great. She just hates him so much-As much as I dislike Ros, that scene turned Littlefinger from a schemy bastard into a truly scary sociopath, his story about the whore who was "transformed" (I don't even want to know what that means) was chilling.-Theon was great in this episode. I wasn't really fond of him in the first season but he was great. The actress they picked for Yara is perfect and Balon as well.-All the Dragonstone scenes were great. In the books it's obvious Mel and Stan are doing the beast with two backs so yeah. Also, Stannis was appropriately awkward during sex. Saan and Davos were great.-Yay Arry and Gendry. Jaqar is perfect as well.-Noooo Hot Blood Rider Rakharo /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />-I still continue to not give a shit about Jon.
197	HannibalStark	2012-04-09	Was one of the weakest episodes in the series thus far, imo.  Not because of the changes, I don't care about that really, its just that it felt disjointed and dragged on too much in the middle. Also, and I say this for the first time ever, there was far too much sex. I was fine with Stannis/Mel scene (although, correct me if I'm wrong, this is a change from the books, yes? I thought it was never clear if Stannis had an affair or was seduced while asleep) but the Theon/Captain's daughter scene dragged on even worse than it did on the page and the brothel scene was completely unnecessary. I would much rather have preferred either another Arya scene, or some checking in with a character not in the episode; maybe show Joffrey being randomly cruel and stupid.There were some definite great scenes of course; Tyrion/Slynt, Tyrion/Cersei, Davos/Saan, Theon/Balon, and Arya/Gendry were all really good, but they were surrounded by a lot that left a lot to be desired.not so sure Mel and Stannis getting it on is a change from the books...I always got the feeling there was something going on, kinda like with Renly and Loras, on TV it needs to be much more direct than the way its alluded to in the books.
198	alnes	2012-04-09	I liked the first episode, but I didn't feel the LOVE last week, now it's back /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> so much great stuff.
The Kingsroad: Perfect.
Loved Yoren being bad ass, Gendry is spot on, Jaquen is great, Arya continues to be the most loveable character on the show. The conversation with Hot Pie and Lemmy was really funny. I somehow liked Hot Pie in the books, in the show he's far from being a likeable kid, great actor though.
King's Landing: Not enough praise can be given to Peter Dinklage. I also love Varys. The scene with Janos Slynt was perfect, I like Bronn's promotion too. We also got to see why Cersei hates Tyrion so much. The brothel scene wasn't necessary, they could have shown us Robb instead, but by itself I thought it was a good scene, Littlefinger has no morals whatsoever.
The Wall: yaaay, Ghost!
I loved Gilly, perfect cast. Good dialogue between the guys. The end with Craster and the Other was unexpected, it's nice not to know what will happen next for a change.
Red Waste: Nothing to see here. The actor dropped out, so the killed his character, can't really complain about that.
Pyke: Only great scenes here.
"Try smiling with your lips closed - hm. better." Alfie Allen is an awesome douchebag Theon. Balon Greyjoy couldn't be better as well.
As for Asha: She's confident and cocky, but by no means this awesome warrior queen who would be able to earn respect and lead men in this ultra-macho society on the Iron Islands. Still, really good actress.
Dragonstone: Sallador Saan <3
Davos is spot on. I'm not entirely happy with Stannis, not "irony" enough, but I didn't feel the scene with Mel was out of place.
I only read the books after I saw the first season, so I guess I'm easier to please than someone who's been with the books for a decade or longer.
199	LuisDantas	2012-04-09	I liked Stannis' depiction so far in the series. 
While I seem to be in a minority, it is clear to me that Stannis is not any kind of moral reference, although Davos and himself see him as such.
Stannis has time and again shown a lot of moral shortcomings, not least of all deep hypocrisy, and the TV Series seems to understand that perfectly.
Incidentally, I have often wondered why Davos is so loyal to him.  Am I the only one wondering if the episode wanted to hint of a homosexual attraction to Stannis, with that talk about he being his God?
200	dtones520	2012-04-09	I didn't have a problem with Stannis banging Mel on screen, BUT how the scene was arranged was somewhat ridiculous and inflicted major damage to Stanni's cool. He should have been much more reluctant about it, in a non-passionate quickly-perform-his-duty kinda way (which would have been even more awesome because of how eyefriendly Mel actually is)To me, it was very much like Stannis doing his duty.  He didnt want to at first, Mel touched on how his wife sucked and couldn't produce him an heir (and left it ambiguous as to whether or not Shireen was alive), I think she probably put some sort of spell on him (that or just being super hot) brought up the son and got Stannis on board with doing it.  He knows his ultimate duty is to take the Iron Throne, if banging Mel helps him do that, well so be it.   Then he actually does it, and it is the worst sex scene possible.   Seems like he was 2-3 pumps and was done and he sounded totally ackward when he did it, with his gross grunts.
201	Howland Reed	2012-04-09	Didn't Sallador Saan wear very flamboyant clothing?
202	tearloch	2012-04-09	The way they are focusing on Ros, I think that Ros will be the one who will be forced to marry Ramsay in the show as fake Arya.Because Ros will be able to be passed off as a teenage girl?  Don't see that happening.....
203	Auska	2012-04-09	I also thought Mel "seduced" Stanis in his sleep (maybe with him subcounsiously aware of it) and that "he always does what is right".  Having sex just at the promise of a son seems to lesson his character and his strength.I liked it, and also the show of weakness hidden from view. Brings a little more realism in the character for the screen: for me, Stannis in the books is just barely on this side of absurd. Even the most iron-willed have a button, if you can find itâ<U+0080>¦
204	Dacie	2012-04-09	Really, really liked this episode.
All the stuff with Arya on the King's Road-Yoren, Hot Pie, Lommy, Jaqen, Gendry-seemed spot on to me.  Exactly how I pictured it.
The Tyrion scenes were great (the only complaint I have is the "fish pie" line kinda grossed me out...and they kept repeating it over and over)
Davos, Salla, and Mathos were great.  
I  actually really liked the scene with Mel and Stannis.  It was sufficiently awkward, which is how I imagine it went down in the book, and will answer a lot of questions when she births the shadowbaby.  I am a little sad that they've possibly left out Shireen, which makes me think she won't have an important role in the books in the future.  Also, it won't give an introduction to greyscale.  
I thought the Ironborn scenes were really good.  I liked Balon and I also liked Asha/Yara.  I liked how it showed Theon strutting into Pyke like he owned the place, all decked out in his finest, and ended up looking like a fool.  Again, just as I pictured it.
Craster's was a lot creepier this episode, and I think it was a good choice to show him actually giving a child to the Others.  Ghost also looked great.
205	Katydid	2012-04-09	Having Joffrey be responsible for the purge of his father's (or so he thinks) bastards makes him a better villain;I'm coming to terms with the fact that the writers/producers are going to take their artistic liberties.  Or, I'm resigned to it, anyway.  I won't agree with all the changes or additions, but maybe they won't all piss me completely off.That said, I don't see why Joffrey needs to be a better villain, when it's his mother that perfectly fills that role.  I don't want a softer, sympathetic Cersei. I want bitch-monster Book!Cersei, the one who verbally bitch-slaps Tyrion in this episode, ripping him for her mother's death.Joffrey is a whiny brat that screams for his mommy when he cuts himself on the throne.  Cersei is the one who is crazy, power-hungry and bloodthirsty enough to murder babies.  (Nevermind the fact that, are we really meant to believe that Joffrey is smart enough to have coordinated the search for all Robert's bastards?)I can only hope that, after the Purple Wedding, Cersei goes into her crazed mode, and we get her on-screen as she's meant to be.

206	FiveByeSeven	2012-04-09	Didn't Sallador Saan wear very flamboyant clothing?Compared to Davos' and Matthos' drab seaweed cloaks, he had very extravagant clothes. He also sported an exotic scabbard. What was flamboyant was his swaggering pimp-walk when he bid them adieu.Loved the bit where he made it look like he was going to make a grab for Matthos, and Matthos literally jumped away from him.
207	duncanthemedium	2012-04-09	Let me begin by saying that I rated the episode a solid 8. I will reserve the 10 for the Blackwater episode, which I think would be awesome to see.
I want to address, what I view as a recurring problem for the book-loyalists. I have said this before, we must be able to see the TV show as its own thing. And as such, it has a slightly different discourse on Power. I think even from the pre-season that dealing with Power is the theme of the season. The books are such an expansive and limitless medium of discourse, that GRRM is able to comment on a plethora of ways of handling power. The TV series, needs (by the necessity of the medium) to converge on a discourse, a unity of opinion towards which actions happening on different continents and in different kingdoms can climax towards. I think there is also, with characters like Ros and the girl on the boat and the Arya storyline, a hint towards some kind of a class politics. Remember, these are not 'players' of the 'game of thrones' but pawns albeit with their own agency and limits of operation.
In that sense, both the Stannis scene and the Ros/LF scene works beautifully. Look at how we hear and like different renditions of classic songs by new artists. They all bring in a bit of their own to the material even though the structure of the song, the lyrics, the music is essentially the same. 
This TV adaptation works in exactly the same way. And the symphony they play is a sweet one indeed...
208	Gronzag	2012-04-09	I think that Jon's unconsciousness after being knocked out is when we will se his first warging into ghost
209	FiveByeSeven	2012-04-09	I can only hope that, after the Red Wedding, Cersei goes into her crazed mode, and we get her on-screen as she's meant to be.Not sure you meant the Red Wedding. Maybe the one that comes after. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
210	Magjee	2012-04-09	Seeing Jon getting ko'ed by Caster, was thinking...
Will they skip Half-hand and Jon's supposed betrayl and start his Wildling adventure now?
Maybe the Fist of the First Men is replaced by an attack on Craster's Keep.
It's one way to condense the story.
211	iheartseverus	2012-04-09	.PS  What the hell are warning points and why don't I have any of them?Ahem, as someone who does have a warning point, I shall explain.  Once upon a time long, long ago, I was browsing here and drinking wine in the middle of the night.  At some point, the wine told me it would be a great and clever idea to post a nasty poem about a couple of the members I wasn't getting along with.  It felt like the wittiest, giggle-inducing idea I'd had in a long while.  Til the next morning.  My poem was gone and I had a convo from Ran that I was suspended for 3 days.  Alas.  THAT'S how you get a warning point!
212	BigFatCoward	2012-04-09	haven't seen the episode yet but i'm not concerned about the producers changing things up, if the show is going to get past Feast/Dance then there will have to be major changes to make the show workable and watchable.
213	FanTasy	2012-04-09	Loved the way they made Pyke look. Awsome. Loved Ghost even more ... they put in the red eyes at last.
In general: mixed feelings. But I realise it would be nearly impossible for Season 2 of the show to get me hooked completely. Season 1 taught me GRRM and the books existed /blushing.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':blushing:' /> and after that I have read the books several times. 
So my hopes were not that high up when watching Season 2 ...
But to give credit to the show: I like what they are doing.
You have to be very explicit, you can't use the subtle build up in the books.
- Suspicions confirmed that Joffrey could have had a hand in ordering the slaying of the bastard children in Kings Landing. It fits in that the show seems to make Cersei look more as a counterpart of Catelyn, less evil and disturbed than she is in the books.
- Littlefingers scene with Roz: I get why at this stage they have to picture him as an evil schemer and a pimp. Otherwise viewers wouldn't get what happens between him and Sansa later on.
- Bronn as commander of the City Watch was a shock. I suppose they are cutting the whole thing with Lollys and found a way to get him in a position where his later choices will be better understood.
- Silver and the bloodrider: digressions I can understand, serving the goal of fleshing up Dany's desperate situation
- Craster whacking Jon I definitely didn't like, have to wait how they are resolving this in Episode 3 but it was a thing I disliked. I can understand they must have a cliffhanger for the audience that has not read the books.
- Jacqen, Rorge and Biter: nice. Aptly done.
- Tyrion: mixed feelings. Found his acting performance better in Season 1. He gives the impression of a bad ass and not the man who is ambition driven but at the main time terribly insecure.
All in all kudo's for the show runners.
214	WillWork4NinjaPowers	2012-04-09	I was actually thinking they could make Ros take the place of Jeyne when she is sent off to Ramsay. Even though I wouldn't nessacerily "like it" they haven't cast Jeyne and they could have Theon recognize her like he does Jeyne.Wasn't Jeyne Poole in Season 1?
215	Katydid	2012-04-09	Not sure you meant the Red Wedding. Maybe the one that comes after. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Yes, thank you - - I meant the Purple one!
216	FanTasy	2012-04-09	Ow forgot: Stannis and Melisandre: yes of course we knew from the books they had sex. The one thing I found disappointing that the show suggests Stannis does it because he is promised a son. The books are clear imo, although subtle: he has sex with her because he knows it will cause Renly's death.
217	Jamie Lannister	2012-04-09	Varys slaughtered this episode.And I keep on paddling.
218	Vuron	2012-04-09	I liked Stannis' depiction so far in the series.While I seem to be in a minority, it is clear to me that Stannis is not any kind of moral reference, although Davos and himself see him as such.Stannis has time and again shown a lot of moral shortcomings, not least of all deep hypocrisy, and the TV Series seems to understand that perfectly.Incidentally, I have often wondered why Davos is so loyal to him.  Am I the only one wondering if the episode wanted to hint of a homosexual attraction to Stannis, with that talk about he being his God?This, this, and more this.... everyone always stating that Stannis is this way or Stannis is that way in the books always seems to forget that we really only see Stannis from one POV and that's Davos.  I've thought all along that Davos had a man crush on Stannis, anyway.  People claiming that Stannis hates bastards and would never father one or do anything for one seem to forget that he was more than willing to give Winterfell to Jon in order to get what he wanted.  I think people are giving Stannis way too much credit and he is just a man, after all.I think the Mel/Stannis scene was fine and was probably pretty close to what would have happened in the books if we had a POV.
219	FiveByeSeven	2012-04-09	Yes, thank you - - I meant the Purple one!You're welcome. I never did understand though why fans dubbed it the "Purple Wedding."
	Spoiler Joffrey's face was explicitly mentioned as having turned black. "The Black Wedding" should be more apt!

220	StarkBlack21	2012-04-09	Is Allister Thorne cut from the series? or will we see him appearing at Kings Landing? Love Thorne in season 1
221	FiveByeSeven	2012-04-09	Varys slaughtered this episode.And I keep on paddling.I love how the writers re-contextualized that line from Clash. Hope we get to see more classic lines from the books given new life and layers in the series.
222	IceVyper	2012-04-09	Saw a few posts where people think Jon is dead. Serisously? We've all seen promo shots, footage and have read the books and we know that he lives.
They just need him unconcisous for a while (like Bran) so he can start skinchanging. I do hope that he will be appearing in all episodes, not like last season.
What I want to see now is how they will make peace with Craster now that he has attacked Jon.
223	Ran	2012-04-09	Oh, yes, Conleth Hill remains absolutely perfect as Varys. He's a better Varys than Dinklage is Tyrion.
224	Thorny Issues	2012-04-09	Hi all I'm new (but have lurked for a while),My two coppers worth:Balon Greyjoy - superb. Really great and made a much greater impact on me than I remember from the books. He is a mad old sod though...Yara (Asha) - honestly, I think it's too soon to judge. Quite a lot of smirking going on, and I would have enjoyed a bit more verbal sparring. She seemed a bit smug in the scene with Baron, which isn't quite how I think of her. I shall withhold judgement until I see how she handles an axe (also, looks are neither here nor there; though I think she's striking, which is much much better than model beautiful. That would be daft).'Unfortunate' captain's daughter - what a brave actress. I thought that was a really painful scene to watch, for the right reasons. I also think its the most justifiable sex scene thus far (it shows both Theon's character (and will pay off in his future...trials), and the general gender imbalance in Westeros - certainly much more convincingly than any brothel scenes).Ghost - I love the Dire Wolves. They're huge, and they look amazing. Top CGI work.Gilly - perfect!Samwell - That guy can really act. So much with just a look/shrug. Fantastic stuffStannis - hmmm. Getting a little worried now. Last week he was perfect, I thought. But giving in to lust/promise of a son just doesn't sit right. I know its implied that something like this happened in the books, but I will need a good dose of stern, iron Stannis next week to make up for this.Mel - not sure the nudity was needed, but she retains a mystique all the same.Arya/Hotpie/Gendry - Every moment a joy. Best scenes this season for me...Tyrion - ...though Tyrion is, as ever, masterfully played.Bronn - Hurrah! Looks like we'll be getting extra Bronn, which is excellent newsCersei - continues to impress. Scene with Tyrion crackled with tensionLittlefinger - He is a bit of a perve in the books, so that's fine I guess. I think the being scary to Ros scenes (or something like them) are needed for none readers. Otherwise later *ahem* revelations are just going to seem...surprising to say the least. But what the heck is going on with his accent?Davos - perfect. I knew he would beSaan - it's odd. I never had a fixed mental image of him from the books. That happens to me sometimes. So, since the actor did such a great job, I shall simply picture him. It works fine (place of origin can be shifted/made mysterious; I don't think it matters all that much for the series)Varys - still paddling away. MasterfulYoren - yeah, I wouldn't mess with him either. It's going to be painful. Hope he goes out well...Pyke - looks perfectCraster/Jon - I see the need to explicitly reintroduce the big bad not seen since the first episode. However, three problems: a) Since Craster has now attacked Jon, surely the Craster's keep scenes are going to have to play out differently now aren't they? That's a bit risky (and unneccesary?). b ) Where's Ghost? Why doesn't he rip Craster's arm off before he touches Jon? c) Sam's encounter later on loses some impact now, unless Jon doesn't say anything to anyone (which would be stupid)?Head in a bag - I understand the actor became unavailable. That's a shame, because he was really great. One slight worry: why isn't the horse followed back?Old guy on the peer - finally, I must applaud this actor. Just pitch-perfect representation of Theon's distance from his own people.

225	tearloch	2012-04-09	I have read the books.  I love the books.  But I am not in the camp that gets upset with every little change that HBO makes.  One thing you have to keep in mind is how GRRM wrote the books.  Everything we see in the books is through a character POV.  Sometimes those POVs slant how you see a character.  Shae is a great example.  We really only see Shae through Tyrion's eyes.  Tyrion always saw her as loyal to him.  But in the end, we find out that she was not how Tyrion saw her, she was loyal to herself, and when she got a chance to better her lot, she took it.  I like that HBO is bringing out the true characters in people for the show. 
I also don't mind the changes with Joh so far.  We all know Jon is a do gooder.  So on screen, HBO has Jon see Craster give a child to the Others, instead of having Gilly tell it to us.  Shows are meant to be visual.  Too much dialogue losers the viewers.  In the end, we get to the same point (which is knowing what Craster is doing).  And I am sure Mormont will tell him to shut his whole about it....that everyone in the NW already knew it....that sometimes its not right vs. wrong, good vs. evil....that sometimes you have to choose your battles.  All of these things are part of Jon's growth in the books, and HBO is keeping with the spirit of Jon's character, even if they are deviating from how GRRM did it.
Same goes for Stannis.  So he desires a son.  Is a bastard son better than a crippled daughter?  In the mind of a warrior, I bet it is.  We don't have the luxury of hundreds of pages to develop Stannis' iron will.  And, back to my original point, Stannis' iron will is developed throught Davos' POV.  When we see Stannis through other POVs, like Jon's later in the series, his will is not so iron, is it?  He will make Jon a legit Stark, but only if Jon agrees to his deal.  Doesn't sound like such an iron will.
226	WillWork4NinjaPowers	2012-04-09	You're welcome. I never did understand though why fans dubbed it the "Purple Wedding."
	Spoiler Joffrey's face was explicitly mentioned as having turned black. "The Black Wedding" should be more apt!
The stones from Sansa's hairnet are purple.

228	The Last Dragon	2012-04-09	Absolutly loved this episode! 
Thrilled to see J'qan Hagar. Loved his third person speech and the way he brought the lines. He is one of my favorite charachters in ACoK and really looking forward to see more of him this season. 
I can totally understand most of the changes to the story. In 10 episodes you cannot fully comprehend the vastness of this story, so the producers must be straight to the point on some occasions. 
Again Tyrion was great, also loved the way Varys his voice was lowered when receiving the threat from Tyrion. So badass. 
Seeing Ghost was great, Pyke was fenomenal. Really felt sorry for Theon. Seeing the White Walker again was creepy. Props to the sound department for the scary clicks they make. My non-reading girlfriend was thought it was pretty damn scary, so good job! 
Can't wait for next week.

229	WillWork4NinjaPowers	2012-04-09	One complaint I don't get is that Stannis doesn't look like a warrior.  I don't think Stannis is ever described as looking like a warrior.  He is tall and thin in the books, I thought, where Robert is built like a warrior and in turn Renley, who is supposed to look just like Robert.  The casting of Renley bothers me more than the casting of Stannis, although I do not think the actor is owning the role at the moment.
I don't think Bronn will see Bywaters fate.  If they are killing off people still alive in the books, I hope that it's because they know from GRRM that those characters do not exist past WoW.
I was really wanting Yara/Asha to be closer in appearance to what she is described as in the books.  I am not a fan as of now.
Really did like Jaqen.
I hate Craster clobbering Jon.  Now that has to be dealt with, creating a storyline that doesn't exist in the series and takes away from actual events  in the series.  That irks me.
230	lostinwesteros	2012-04-09	More disappointed in this episode than the first one.  Mel and Stannis?  Come on - she'll give him a son?  Does she mean shadow babies?  IMO just inserted sensationalism for TV. Loved Jaquen!  Cringed at the other two, i.e., HBO did a great job on them.What was with the last scene with Jon?  I just don't like it when too many liberties are taken deviating from the books.  It was nice to see a white walker, although of course I wanted to see more!I hated changing the script so that Bronn was the new Commander of the City Watch -- unrealistic!  Lastly, but most importantly -- WHAT HAS HBO DONE WITH RAKHARO?  I did hear the interview with Martin yesterday when he alluded to HBO's having more or less a box of heads and that they were really expensive to  make.  So will we see more of these bodyless heads just so HBO can get full use out of their props?OK - I really didn't realize I was so unhappy with the episode until I started writing.  But I was also disappointed that they rushed over so many things. Gee -- I'm not usually so critical!  But, there it is.  /mad.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':angry:' />
231	Magjee	2012-04-09	Is Allister Thorne cut from the series? or will we see him appearing at Kings Landing? Love Thorne in season 1I think he arrives in KL a little later if I remember the books correctly.Then he is made to wait and the hand rots.So maybe midway through the season.
232	LuisDantas	2012-04-09	I should have seen Raquro's death coming, classic mauve shirting in the previous episode.#This episode showed me two things:1. I  can't remember any instance in the books where it is definitely confirmed that Cersei ordered the killings.2. Replacing Slynt with Bronn instead of Swann is a brilliant way of highlighting Tyrion's hypocrisy.How is choosing a man he trusts hypocrisy?
233	FiveByeSeven	2012-04-09	Spoiler Because it was the purple stone from Sansa's hairnet that poisoned and killed Joffrey.
The stones from Sansa's hairnet are purple.Aaah! Now that definitely makes sense. Thank you. Consider me enlightened.

							Edited by Ser Lany Cassandra, 09 April 2012 - 08:46 AM.
235	tearloch	2012-04-09	How is what we saw different from the book? Stannis isn't acting out of lust (rewatch the scene; the moment Melisandre disrobes, Stannis moves to put a damn table debtween them) - Melisandre says here's how you're going to win, and then tells him she'll give him a son to get him past his marriage vows. Look, as Ran points out this sex act had to happen. And what we saw was something that was couched in terms of duty and a reluctantly embraced religion and a huge amount of awkwardness. That's Stannis!Dead on IMHO.  In the books, I seem to remember thinking that Stannis had sex with Mel the night before (or right before) Mel goes with Davos into Stormsend.  I think there was some alluding to it, but don't really recall (ordered everyone out of his tent except Mel, and yada yada).  So HBO moved it up an episode....it is still based on Mel needing his "seed" to birth the shadow baby, to get Stannis the men he needs in battle.  This was not about lust for Stannis, this was about duty.As far as Shireen and the "still born" comments, IDK know for sure if HBO really sees the value in casting (paying for) an actress to play Stannis' daughter.  Does she ever move the plot of the series forward?  Maybe the greyscale stuff, but that could easily be his wife with greyscale.  If you recall episode 1 on the beach, after Stannis gets his fiery sword, he starts to charge off the beach.  He stops, and turns back to retrieve his wife.  ONLY his wife.  There was no child with them.  I do think Shireen has been scrapped, and I for one will not shed a tear for that "omission".
236	CrypticWeirwood	2012-04-09	-Yara Greyjoy. I absolutely DO NOT mean the actress, she's great. I hate the name change to Yara. Asha Greyjoy and Osha are different names and hardly confusing, and does it even matter since Osha is leaving at the end of this season?... she is leaving I hope. And that they are not going to change it to keep her around.Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re probably thinking of them like the words ash and ocean in an American accent, but they wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t sound like that in most UK accents, where Asha might well have the a of UK father, and Osha could sound really close to that, especially in speakers with the cotâ<U+0080><U+0093>caught merger. They would thus end up being very close, and  in some accent even indistinguishable.
237	legba11	2012-04-09	Forum wouldn't work for me last night, after that first post (booo), so first impressions:
Much stronger that 2.01.  They stuck with a few stories this time, I'm fine with no Jaime (who i think is the best part of the show), noticed him not in credits.  the theme seemed 'The cost of love/sex"
I thought the Tyrion/Cersei parts were ok, a bit disappointing as they figured to be the highpoint.
Tyrion/Varys was great (though short)
Balon and Jaqen are both as great as I had hoped.  They are my Troy McClure's of the books (minor characters who I love).  Both delivered a ton of awesome in a few lines.
Yara letting Theon go a bit further was icky.  This and wiping spooge off a whore's mouth were our HBO! moments.  These annoy me.  I am fine with sex in the story (several examples of it in this ep.), just throwing taboos on the screen is cheap.
Seeing Melisandre seduce Stannis and Davos seduce Sallador was about 1000x times better than happening off screen.  (OMG Sallador is black!  He must be from District 11!)
I approve of Jon's scene, though I wish he has actually tried to be sneaky. CRUNCH! CRUNCH! No reason to hid behind trees (until the end).  I'm happy Crastor noticed, otherwise that was a bit silly.  They need to keep the Walkers in the show, It's acceptable in books to just have your BBEG talked about and never do anything (as books are just that, things being told to the reader).  On film, it's lacking.
Dany scene was a waste in this episode, should have happened next week when that story goes further (I assume).  At least have someone mention The Night Lands to make the connection.
Arya! Gendry! Yoren! That scene rocked.
238	The burned dog	2012-04-09	I was looking forward to discussing this episode, but seriously I canÂ´t stand all this wailing of women about changes and sex.
Personally, I loved it.

239	dtones520	2012-04-09	I don't know if anyone noticed, but they made Lommy's hands green.  Thought that was cool.
240	Kaitscralt	2012-04-09	I thought this episode was one of the shows weakest, if not the weakest -- yet I still enjoyed it very much. I am going to randomly list my observations and pros and cons.
Things I liked:
1) Character performances -- Lena and Peter continue to steal the shows best scenes, but I also thought basically the entire cast had a great episode. The Greyjoy's were all great, as well as the Night's Watch, the King's Road crew, Varys and many more.
2) Stannis & Dragonstone crew -- I am far less worried about Shireen and Selyse than others here, nor am I finding Stannis to be any less bad-ass and stern. The sex scene was handled fine. He gave in to a beautiful naked sorceress, as any warm-blooded male would. I don't know how Stannis' morals are being judged when we know he is days away from having his brother murdered, which is one of the greatest sins on the Westeros morality scale. Plus, he scarcely seemed to even be enjoying the seduction. Just watch how he kisses her and those noises he makes. It was all incredibly awkward, as it should have been. Side note: Davos' scene was just perfect.
3) Giving Joffrey and Robb a break -- Thank you! It's time to slow things down whenever possible.
4) Ghost -- Enough said.
5) Varys -- I so loved his exchange with Tyrion. I like that the show is making threats more blatant, even if it makes the characters seem a bit more dim. The way Varys held the door shut with a finger after Tyrion used his whole hand was awesome. Plus they kept in the great ocean/fish/paddling analogy. He recognizes that Tyrion is a bigger threat than anyone else in King's Landing, so he is making it known that he is the top dog.
6) Arya's scene was pure gold. Gendry looks different to me than he did in the forge, and it keeps distracting me. Maybe it is the lack of sweat and smithy outfit, or maybe the actor has grown up a bit. I still loved everything about this scene, including Jaqen.
Things I didn't like:
1) How the writers handled the Yara/Theon exchange -- In the books she is clearly messing with him, moving his hands away and finally after revealing herself making him very embarassed. On the show, a lot of non-book readers are going to think she is really creepy and incestous. While Alfie's facial expression conveyed his disgust perfectly afterwards, I do think maybe a line or two could have been added to make Yara seem just a bit less gross. I love the way she looks though -- gritty and tomboyish, with a sex appeal underneath it all. The idea of a perfect 10/10 beauty queen swinging two axes around and winning the loyalty of barbarians always seemed fake to me. This woman is one who looks like she has killed.
2) Cutting from a ship sex scene to a brothel sex scene -- Really bizarre choice of editing here. Didn't work at all for me. I also found the Littlefinger spying to be a bit confusing and unnecessary. I hate thinking, "Are the non-readers going to be thinking this random nobleman is important?" Otherwise, I did like Littlefinger's creepiness and scariness. The scene was a bit long but I liked showing what a sociopath he is.
3) The Red Waste of Time -- Poor Daenerys and Jorah really have nothing to do for a while. Not the writers faults, but if we don't need to see Robb sitting in the woods, we don't need to see Daenerys sitting in the sand. More swearing vengeance, promising blood, blah blah.
4) Jon getting bonked by Crastor -- I'm not sure why this isn't sitting well with me, as I don't mind the other changes involved in this story line. Or maybe I just hate cliffhangers. I like Jon giving in to his emotions and charging into the woods with his sword drawn. I need to see what happens, obviously, but I do think Ghost should be around...
--
Also, I continue to be unbothered by character development changes and things like Bronn over Bywater. This is a separate entitiy from the novelization.
241	tearloch	2012-04-09	What I didn't like...  -Yara Greyjoy. I absolutely DO NOT mean the actress, she's great. I hate the name change to Yara. Asha Greyjoy and Osha are different names and hardly confusing, and does it even matter since Osha is leaving at the end of this season?... she is leaving I hope. And that they are not going to change it to keep her around. Also on a side-note. Is anyone else worried that Ramsay Bolton hasn't been cast yet, or the Reeds? These characters are vital to the stories for Bran and Theon, and in Ramsay's case much of ADwD and the following books. Episode 8 is titled The Prince of Winterfell, so hopefully we'll see "Reek" then, or hear about him beforehand. LotNFrom what I have heard, Osha will be replacing the Reeds in Bran's storyline.  I don't like it, because I grew very fond of the Reeds.  But I do understand it was simply about $$.  Osha has the "Old God" knowledge that the Reeds brought to Bran.  She has experience north of the Wall that the Reeds did not.  The only thing I worry about is who will take Rickon?  My gut says Maester Luwin will take Rickon and Shaggydog on their path, with Osha, Hodor, and Bran going together.Not sure if Ramsay has been cast yet, but he better be an uber psycho....
242	FiveByeSeven	2012-04-09	If you recall episode 1 on the beach, after Stannis gets his fiery sword, he starts to charge off the beach.  He stops, and turns back to retrieve his wife.  ONLY his wife.  There was no child with them.  I do think Shireen has been scrapped, and I for one will not shed a tear for that "omission".Too bad. No Shireen means no Patchface either. Would have been interesting to see the creepy jester I-know-I-know-oh-oh-oh his way to the screen.
243	Olorun Sand	2012-04-09	I havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t read the whole thread yet.  On my way to work so I apologize in advance if I'm repeating posts from before.I've read all the books and I'm fine, ecstatic even, when the show deviates.  As long as they stay with the spirit of the story and the world that George has made for us.  In fact seeing ACoK word for word and scene by scene would make a dull watch for me.  That being said....the parts that made this episode lack luster for me was the LF/Ros scene.  I get the point but don't care for the execution.  Seems a bit ham fisted in making LF seem ruthless and all about LF only.  I think they could of used that time to make the Theon/Yara scene more witty and funny.  I kept thinking they really missed at comedy gold cutting that conversation to a forth of it's potential.  There were a few more slow bulky spots but as a whole I did enjoy it.  Loved the huge CGI Ghost and most everything dealing with beyond The Wall.  The same for Arya and Gendry heading North.  I think this season will really ramp up when Renly and Stannis start in on each other.
244	boojam	2012-04-09	Hated they killed Rhakaro, he was hot.I figured they have to have a Dany scene each episode, Emilia Clarke has become an associated A-lister for the show the non readers are going to say 'where the hell is Dany?!".Was it Rhakaro? I am still confused about that.Really need a tragedy each episode? Yeah I know George like's grit, but even George does not punch up each chapter that way. So that's odd.

245	FiveByeSeven	2012-04-09	I don't know if anyone noticed, but they made Lommy's hands green.  Thought that was cool.Had to go back and check again. You're right! That was a brilliant touch. Guess it has to do with his old job as a dyer's apprentice (can't remember if the book ever touched on that). Still weirds me out how slavish this show is to some minute details, and how lenient it is to more obvious stuff.

246	Magjee	2012-04-09	From what I have heard, Osha will be replacing the Reeds in Bran's storyline.WHOA!That's a huge change, stings a little.
247	BearShin	2012-04-09	I hated the actress playing Yara/Asha. She had the right look, but she was a bad actress. She sounded flat and false.
248	ServantOnIce	2012-04-09	In the last production shot from Ireland it shows Bran, Rickon, Osha, and Hodor leaving the ruins of Winterfell. I think Maester Luwin dies as it would be impractical for a person so old to make such a long journey.  The Reeds may appear next season and take Rickon to Skagos whil Osha, Hodor and Bran go north. The reality is that Osha is popular with the TV audience and with the producers they can't write her out for infinity.
I still don't know if there will be a Reek . . . Ramsay may be left out completely.
249	ServantOnIce	2012-04-09	I hated the actress playing Yara/Asha. She had the right look, but she was a bad actress. She sounded flat and false.I felt the opposite, wrong look but great acting . .
250	Three Dog Knight	2012-04-09	Can I just say...I fell asleep watching this episode about 30 minutes in, and woke up with about 10 seconds left.  In my groggy, partially-seeing state, I thought it was Mormont that whacked Jon (!).  I was trying to figure out WTF was going on in my head all night.  Finally watched it again this morning.  /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
251	wyman's cook	2012-04-09	I think that Jon's unconsciousness after being knocked out is when we will se his first warging into ghosti don't get it..why wouldn't Craster just kill him ? it doesn't make any sensepretty silly change, this one..Seeing Jon getting ko'ed by Caster, was thinking...Will they skip Half-hand and Jon's supposed betrayl and start his Wildling adventure now?Maybe the Fist of the First Men is replaced by an attack on Craster's Keep.It's one way to condense the story.this sounds nice, but half hand, is aA2ready casted and confirmed /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />

252	boojam	2012-04-09	5) Varys -- I so loved his exchange with Tyrion. I like that the show is making threats more blatant, even if it makes the characters seem a bit more dim. The way Varys held the door shut with a finger after Tyrion used his whole hand was awesome. Plus they kept in the great ocean/fish/paddling analogy. He recognizes that Tyrion is a bigger threat than anyone else in King's Landing, so he is making it known that he is the top dog.I am going to show my laziness again. I not going back over the novel to read this Varys - Tyrion conversation again.Is it from CoK?I just don't remember Tyrion accusing Varys of a threat? Thought they always got along?I probably need correcting.
253	Robin Of House Hill	2012-04-09	Why did they change Asha Greyjoy's name to Yara?  I can almost understand last season's change of Robert Arryn to Robin Arryn because they thought the audience couldn't figure out two characters with the same first name, but why change Asha???
254	FiveByeSeven	2012-04-09	Also, what Melisandre whispered to Matthos was absolutely chilling:
	Spoiler "Death by fire is the purest form of death."

I've read the books, but that sinister foreshadowing has me dreading
	Spoiler Matthos's eventual demise on the Blackwater.
255	Ser Hippie	2012-04-09	I am going to show my laziness again. I not going back over the novel to read this Varys - Tyrion conversation again.Is it from CoK?I just don't remember Tyrion accusing Varys of a threat? Thought they always got along?I probably need correcting.In the book Tyrion finds Varys hanging out with Shae and recognizes the implicit threat in that (I know what you're doing, I know who Shae is, etc.). In the show they chose to make it more explicity, presumably so the point isn't missed.As for complaints about Stannis/Mel - he's not about honor, he's about duty. He sleeps with Melisandre because it's his duty to win the war and claim the throne.

256	Chelly	2012-04-09	Wow! I loved it! I don't even care about the changes, they don't bother me. First of all, Pyke looked amazing and exactly how I pictured it in my mind. The actor playing Balon was perfect. The scene between him and Theon was so convincing. My poor, son of a vicious whore Theon. He's such an asshole, but I can't help that he's one of my favorite characters. Alfie Allen plays Theon just right so you feel both embarrassed for him and want to punch him in the face at the same time. The actress playing Asha exceeded my expectations, I thought she owned it. She got the same swagger and confidence that makes her attractive like Theon has, imo, which fits them being brother and sister. So what, she's not model pretty, she looks like what an ironborn woman would look like, imo. She looks a little tough, hard, gritty, and she gives the impression of a woman who would be commanding her own men in an otherwise very sexist culture. She's a woman who earned her respect from the men including her cold and bitter father.Damn, off to work here's a short list...Like:Arya/GendryYoren and all the scenes with Hot Pie and Arya, Lommy can go away.Cersei was on fire this episodeTyrion and Janos - replacing Bywater with Bronn as commander of city watch was a good way to condense and eliminate a very minor character. Also more Bronn!Salladhor - The actor did a fine job and he was very fun to watch. He had the right amount of flamboyance without being to cartoony. I loved his whole "I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her." and his "I can be very convincing" Hee.Nice acting between Irri and Dany over Rakharro's death.Love:All things Theon, Greyjoy, and Pyke!NW including, Dolorous Edd, Sam/Gilly, and Jon. Gilly is too cute and I love the Sam and Jon exchanges, Also Ghost is one magnificent beast.Last, but not least... Jaqen! /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' /> Hello, there gorgeous man. Even for the 1 minute of screen time he had, I already knew I am going to love him. He's got the charm, mystery, and danger that embodies Jaqen, I got all that from the one minute, yes I did. I lol'd at how he pronounced the last name, only because the way GRRM spelled it, it is pretty damn unpronounceable.
257	boojam	2012-04-09	Oh, yes, Conleth Hill remains absolutely perfect as Varys. He's a better Varys than Dinklage is Tyrion.Odd thing to say, they both seem pitch perfect to me.
258	wyman's cook	2012-04-09	I am going to show my laziness again. I not going back over the novel to read this Varys - Tyrion conversation again.Is it from CoK?I just don't remember Tyrion accusing Varys of a threat? Thought they always got along?I probably need correcting.Tyrion has an inner monologue/thinks , that Varys's visit was a hidden threat, a message to him, like " i know whta you're hiding and since you're hiding it, then i know it means much to you"
259	Howdyphillip	2012-04-09	I just do not understand all of the complaints about the changes from the book to the TV series. They are still capturing the spirit of this story absolutely magnificently. I am watching the show now with a bunch of non book readers , and they are loving it. This is far and away the best show on TV, and my all time favorite series.If you want an example of a bad TV conversion of a fantasy book, go and read The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher. then, go watch the TV show. After this is done, go write a nice, long letter to D&D about how thankful you are about how wonderful they have been in their story telling.With all of that said, I absolutely loved this episode. Arya being back was just the icing on the cake. I can't imagine a more perfect scene. I also loved, loved, loved the Baelish scene. Some of the best acting of the series so far. Balon was spot on perfect, and they took Gilly right out of my head and put her on screen.We are watching greatness
260	ServantOnIce	2012-04-09	As for complaints about Stannis/Mel - he's not about honor, he's about duty. He sleeps with Melisandre because it's his duty to win the war and claim the throne.As Colonel T. said in the movie "The Patriot", "It is such an ugly business doing one's duty but occasionally it can be a real pleasure." /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />
261	dreamcatcher	2012-04-09	Arya and Gendry are extraodinary, the best scenes in the ep for real. Loved seeing Gilly, she acts as Cassie did /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
262	ServantOnIce	2012-04-09	Tyrion has an inner monologue/thinks , that Varys's visit was a hidden threat, a message to him, like " i know whta you're hiding and since you're hiding it, then i know it means much to you"Exactly espeically when Varys repeated Shae's obvious lie . . .  Varys threatened him big time .  Tyrion did fall into the trap Varys was trying to get his goat, Tyrion lost his coolness . . can't do that with Varys.
263	NW Deserter	2012-04-09	WOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Loved it. And can finally get on the forums now. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />I'll probably be repeating what has been said but here it goes:Kingsroad-Badass of the Week award goes to Yoren. At first, when he brought his knife between the Goldcloak's legs, I thought we were going to get a castration joke - but the fact that he basically was threatening to sever the dude's femeral artery...you just don't get cooler than that. It'll be sad when he dies, the actor playing him is just perfect.-Arya/Gendry/Hot Pie/Lommy were all perfect. One of the few sunny moments this season with the "m'lady" scene. Made me smile. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />-Quick look at Jaqen, made me pleased to learn I'd been pronouncing his name correctly. Looking forward to the Ghost of Harrenhall stuff.Kings Landing-All of Tyrion's stuff was money, as usual. I loved that they brought in the fact that his mom died giving birth, and that Cersei finally found a weak spot in him.-I got giddy with fanboy excitement when they kept Bronn's line about asking how much. I love when they lift lines directly from the book like that.-Varys was effing amazing this week with Tyrion, too. Those two actors together make a great scene.-Littlefinger scene brought his character to a whole new level, from scheming bastard to ruthless sociopath. I loved that monologue.-I personally found the multiple levels of peep-holes in the brothel really amusing on a second watch. It's a great analogy for the devious politics of the capitol.North of the Wall-Dolorous Edd had our whole group laughing, even the non-readers. Great choice leaving him in in the show.-The actor playing Sam is awesome! I love that they're making him sort of a horndog, it makes him a more compelling and (sym)pathetic character.-I don't mind the change with Jon/Craster. I'm looking forward to seeing how it gets resolved. It's nice to be surprised sometimes when I've read the books so many times.-Gilly was cast perfectly too. Oh and Ghost was awesome, more convincing than Grey Wind IMO.Dragonstone-I love Davos' actor, but he talks too damn fast. Maybe it's just because I'm American, but the thick accent with the speed of his dialogue makes me have to really listen hard to pick up the lines. Loved the stuff about Stannis being his god, though.-Sallador was well-cast and perfectly scripted. Loved when he made Mathos squirm a bit.-Mel/Stannis scene was done about as well as it could have been. Also, CVH is really freakin' hot, so that helped.Red Waste-A lot of meh. I feel like they're over-using Dany's lines about vengeance and blood and fire and blah blah. I know the show-writers can't really help it when Dany doesn't do much in the second book, but it's still boring when she comes on screen.Pyke-The visuals of Pyke are stunning, exactly how I thought it'd be.-Balon Greyjoy was cast so perfectly (I feel like I'm saying that a lot).-LOL at how they handled the Theon/Asha stuff. Even funnier than in the books, with Asha's line about "Anyone with a cock can be fooled" or something.-Alfie Allen is doing Theon justice with his portrayal. We're already seeing the inner conflict. I've always thought Theon was one of the most tragic characters in the entire series, and I think if the show gets to the 5th book material, Alfie will portray him excellently.Great episode overall! I like the deviations for the most part, and the parts where it's staying true to the books are stellar.
264	Dru	2012-04-09	Why did they change Asha Greyjoy's name to Yara?  I can almost understand last season's change of Robert Arryn to Robin Arryn because they thought the audience couldn't figure out two characters with the same first name, but why change Asha???I believe it was to not confuse nonbook readers from Ohsa. Thought Asha and Osha were too close so they went with Yara. Thought it was a great episode and new characters well casted. Dont mind the changes at all. I like being surprised and it being different so I am kept guessing. Sick of Ros though but I know they need to give LF screen time and that is never a bad thing because he is so amazingly casted. I could watch Tyrion and Cersie go back and forth forever and have Varys step in from time to time. Best casted and acted trio of characters in the series IMO.
265	bloodymime	2012-04-09	So Craster has captured Jon. Will this be the catalyst for Jon being sent to the wildlings?That's a good thought, they've already changed Jon's story when it comes to that anyways. He asks Mance if he saw where they put the bastard at Robert's feast when asked about deserting but in the tv version he wasn't even in the feast. I guess he could have said they didn't let him in at all but maybe they're wanting to give him a nobler reason to forsake his vows even if the audience is going to know it's a ruse anyways.
266	Robin Of House Hill	2012-04-09	I believe it was to not confuse nonbook readers from Ohsa. Thought Asha and Osha were too close so they went with Yara.So folks can confuse Yara with Arya....right.   Why do TV people think audiences are so dumb?   Oh, wait...
267	the wolf warg	2012-04-09	Everyone keeps complaining about the ros scene, its not so she can have a larger role, she is there for littlefinger and tyrions characters they needed someone to tie everything together and she was a perfect fit
268	Trebla	2012-04-09	My thoughts:- A randy episode. .Fish pies and semen lips. lol Stannis taking Mel atop the Painted Table was a nice touch.-Bronn as Lord Commander makes sense. Bywater is just another character to add.-Joffrey ordering the bastard massacre also makes sense. I don't think it was about his legitimacy but rather a way to show power and act out towards Cersei. Cersei knew all along and she did nothing. she also shamed him by slapping him in front of people. Well Joffrey is not going to take that. A strong king ACTS. It also plants a seed that Joffrey is quite capable of sending men with daggers to kill children. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />-This episode was very good at showing the power of women in Westeros. Cersei is regent and controls the Small Council. Her brother is contesting with her for power. While that may have been a draw so far, she greatly wounded him by hurling Jaime and Joanna against him. That was painful. Yara (I think I may be one of the few that doesn't mind the name change) humiliates her brother and is firmly set as her father's right hand. Melisandre seduces black iron Stannis with dreams of sons and power. She also has Davos' son bent toward her new god.-Set against that are Gilly, Ros, and the captain's daughter. Misused by men and treated as property to be beaten, sold, and even murdered if they do not perform in they wats expected of them. While we have gotten to see the mostly good life of the nobility, I'm glad we are also getting to see the horrors of medievel life.-Podrick! Ghost! Alas for Rakharro. Poor Shireen. In the books she has greyscales, in the tv show she doesn't exist.
269	Katydid	2012-04-09	You're welcome. I never did understand though why fans dubbed it the "Purple Wedding."
	Spoiler Joffrey's face was explicitly mentioned as having turned black. "The Black Wedding" should be more apt!
I assumed it was because the color purple signifies royalty, and it was a royal wedding.
270	Lord Varys	2012-04-09	In my opinion, this episode shows us why it was a huge mistake to downplay Selyse: Truly, why is Stannis even married if this woman did not give him an heir? And Shireen can't be cut. Stannis may not be dead at the end of ADwD, but he is supposed to be dead. Shireen will be declared Queen. So what's going to happen in the TV series if they ever reach that point?
They have to give us Shireen back. The girl is as 'important' as Tommen and Myrcella. She may have little/no screen time, but her existence is important politically.
As to the sex scene: I don't mind it, nor do I mind the setting. Stannis Baratheon cannot be as 'opposed' to sex as his appearance makes us believe. But I do not believe that Mel could seduce Stannis by promising him a son. Nor do I believe that he longed this desperately for a son. If he did, he would have sex with Selyse on a regular basis. As king Stannis would be able to legitimize his bastard son by Mel, true, but would he do this? If Stannis never got an child from Selyse, would he not rather put his wife aside, divorce her, and take Melisandre as his new queen? I think he would, so this does not make any sense at all.
There is a love story between Stannis and Mel. But this only begins after the Blackwater. Before that, Stannis saw Mel only as means to an end (i.e. the Iron Throne). She was his red falcon. Afterwards, she really started to comfort him. And the line in ADwD strongly indicates that Stannis spends his nights with Melisandre on a regular basis. Apparently you can have sex with that woman and not making (shadow) babies ;-). But even then, Stannis is never under her thumb/in her thrall. He outright threatened to kill her in ASoS during the Edric Storm business. He would have done it, if they had ended up sacrificing him without the promised results...
The better thing would have been to play the religious/royal card. Promising Stannis that by laying with her the Lord of Light would give him what he wanted (i.e. the Iron Throne and justice). Also, with Selyse as devoted follower of Melisandre we would have gotten a rather interesting dynamic here. As I see it, it's quite likely that Selyse encouraged Stannis to have sex with Melisandre because it's 'God's will'. Making all of Stannis's followers R'hllorians (and Matthos Seaworth the only talking face of them) lead to that stupid dialogue about religion and atheism between Stannis and his son. Davos only said that Stannis was his god to Axell Florent if I'm not mistaken, because he was afraid that they would consider still a follower of the Seven. But Matthos never would 'report' Davos to Mel/Stannis, so this whole stuff seemed quite out of place to me.
They also gave the first chance away to have Salladhor Saan tell us about the original Azor Ahai and Nissa Nissa. Telling this story is one of the main purposes of Salladhor Saan in the books, so I really think they missed an opportunity here.
As to Littlefinger and Ros:
Completely pointless. Spying and whores and customers alike further makes Littlefinger a moron. The man does not care about sex. He only cares about money, influence, and power. Sure, owning brothels and spying on customers can give him leverage over them, but he would not do this personally. The man is head of the royal treasury. He has work to do.
As for Ros, I simply do not care. I don't see where she is going from here nor do I care. I just found this scene a waste of time. We already knew Littlefinger is an ass, so what was the point?
I also don't like the Joffrey-Cersei-change. Joff is not that much older in the series, and since adulthood starts at the age of 18, not 16, Joffrey should be as far from being a man grown in the series as he was in the books. The Regent rules, the king does not. Considering Cersei's personality she would not back down this easily, nor should series-Joffrey have the cunning to circumvent his mother. Giving Slynt an order is not the same thing than diverging from the script in public. Cersei and the council had real difficulties to countermand Joff's order of executing Ned, but the whole thing makes Cersei a stupid, whining mother. But it's somewhat coherent with Joff's character. He would do this, and it's not that unbelievable that he would have heard talk about Robert's various affairs and his bastard brothers. Killing them is the right thing to do after Stannis sent out his letters.
The rest, Pyke, Asha, Balon, and the captain's daughter, the Kingsroad, Arya, Gendry, Jaqen, Hot Pie and especially Lommy ('I'd yield!') were really great. Not sure about the Jon scene in the end, though. Hundreds of NW men slept around Craster's Keep that night. Would Craster risk to slip out to deliver a boy to the Others? I don't think so...
271	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2012-04-09	I agree that Stannis sleeps with Melisandre in the novels, but did you find that scene acceptable and in general Stannis portrayal acceptable? I think they should have showed Stannis differently in the show than they did and also provided more character development for him.Stannis in the books is Iron willed, very determined, has a very strong sense of believing in his moral code, has strong feelings of bitterness. And also he does not seem as lust obsessed (or obsessed about Melisandre giving his a son) as show Stannis. I don't think the tv show was very successful with its portrayal of Stannis.How much of a moral code would expect any straight man to have with a naked woman in his face?
272	Balefont	2012-04-09	I'm yet another who does not like TV Stannis. TV Stannis is not steel, he is soft lead that melts in Mel's hands. He doesn't even look like Stannis.He's supposed to be the brittle iron (Robert was the 'true steel') but the TV Stannis is ineffectual pewter.

275	TrackerNeil	2012-04-09	I believe it was to not confuse nonbook readers from Ohsa. Thought Asha and Osha were too close so they went with Yara.Although it's strange the writers would remedy the situation by substituting a name that sounds like "Arya."I wasn't a fan of the Littlefinger-Roz scene. I suppose the writers are trying to show us just how ruthless LF is, but can't they have found a more interesting way than having him threaten a character who can in no way strike back?
276	Lord Varys	2012-04-09	Oh, and I really have to compliment Conleth for this episode. He really can be menacing without being becoming all that explicit. That's how Petyr should be as well. Littlefinger does not make threats. He, ah, say that he would appreciate to be left out of Tyrion's intrigues. That's how he threats. And Varys, well, Varys never actually threats anyone at all. He just makes conversation. They really got that one right, I have to admit it.
The only thing they have to repair eventually is Varys's disguise stuff. But as of yet there is no real use for it, I guess.
277	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2012-04-09	People really didn't get that Stannis fucked Melisandre in the books?  I didn't think it could possibly be more clear.  WTF.  Seriously.Reading and comprehending are not one and they same.
278	CrypticWeirwood	2012-04-09	So folks can confuse Yara with Arya....right.  Because Asha and Osha sound very much alike in the UK accents that they are using.  Using standard IPA notation, we might well have these pairs:Asha: U.S. /ËA¦EÉ<U+0099>/, U.K. /ËÉ<U+0091>ËEÉ<U+0099>/Osha: U.S. /ËÉ<U+0094>ËEÉ<U+0099>/, U.K. /ËÉ<U+0092>ËEÉ<U+0099>/Surely you can see that while the U.S. pronunciations are reasonably far apart, the U.K. pronunciations that they would necessarily be using are really rather similar. Yes, there are other U.K. possibilities, but those given above are the most likely ones, and itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s way too close â<U+0080><U+0094> much much closer, say, than the cited counterexample of Arya and Yara.
279	Greywolf2375	2012-04-09	Seeing Jon getting ko'ed by Caster, was thinking...Will they skip Half-hand and Jon's supposed betrayl and start his Wildling adventure now?Maybe the Fist of the First Men is replaced by an attack on Craster's Keep.It's one way to condense the story.That could be, and if it is, I'll be pissed as it will, in my opinion, skip the biggest bad ass moment when Squire Dalbridge stayed behind to give his brothers more time.
280	MountainMan	2012-04-09	I dont mind the changes that they have been making. By and large its all minor stuff. Bronn commanding the city watch? A really nice touch I thought.	 
Most Awesome scenes..
Sallador and Davos. Sallador is awesome. Loved the Cersei fucking dialogue.
Theon and the captian's daughter. She was amazingly cast. I feel sorry for the poor girl having to show those nasty tits on screen though...
Tyrion and Slynt. Not quite so awesome as the books but they did a good job.
Balon Greyjoy. Great casting. He is fucking dope.
The one thing that really bothered me....
Asha/Yara casting. In the books she was my favorite female character. I also envisioned her as being FUCKING SEXY. Sorry but her casting just doesnt do it for me. Maybe she will grow on me but so far... She's just not very good looking and doesnt emit that sex appeal she did in the books.
Cant wait for next sunday!!
281	echoer11	2012-04-09	i didnt like the dynamics of the relationship between joffrey and cersei either, my guess is they are trying to make him more bad ass than he has ever been or will be, while making cercei a more likeable character early on...
IÂ´m all for action/suspense oriented changes over the book (like yoren's scene and the nicking of arteries) but when they try to change the characters just for the sake of simplyfing them I just canÂ´t stand
282	the maid of woodlynne	2012-04-09	You're welcome. I never did understand though why fans dubbed it the "Purple Wedding."
	Spoiler Joffrey's face was explicitly mentioned as having turned black. "The Black Wedding" should be more apt!

	Spoiler Purple because of the color of the stones in Sansa's hairnet/strangler crystals
Eta: my apologies - I see several other folks already answered this. /blushing.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':blushing:' />

283	Trebla	2012-04-09	Except that Joffrey isn't capable, nor a "strong king."  He's a brat and an idiot, and I'd really prefer to see the character that way.His mother is the true power behind the throne, and I feel like she's coming dangerously close to being wasted in this young season. /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />You aren't getting my reference on a "strong king". He throws those words of wisdom at Tywin in ASOS. He appeared to be parroting someone. Tyrion and Cersei suspect Robert but many people  have it was actually Littlefinger. Tywin wasn't impressed and sends him to bed like a child.Of course Joffrey is a brat and an idiot but he's a dangerous one. He thinks that power is being able to do anything he wants to anyone. He has no clue about politics and the dangers. His mother in the books wasn't much better. She didn't become the real power behind the throne until book 4. Tyrion was the power in book 2 and Tywin was in book 3.Cersei is different in the show, being smarter and not quite as ruthless.
284	Francisco R. Fonseca	2012-04-09	Can someone point out how in ACOK the extent of Mel & Stannis's relationship is implied besides the fact that she carries his banners  and other stuff like killing Renly and....the othee guy at Storms' End (name escapes me)? I found him to be a very stern figure and not very sexual at all. In the book he does make a comment to Renly regarding his homosexuality, so I see that, but if someone can help me out on my question I'd appreciate it.
285	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2012-04-09	Theory about Ros crying.Robert visited Winterfell.  We know what a horndog he is.  He visited the winter village  brothel.He liked Ros, visited her in LF brothel.Everyones commented on how heavy Ros looks.Maybe Gendry (and Edric) aren't the only bastards left.How about she was traumatized by watching an infant being snatched from her mothers breast and butchered like a dog? wow.
286	Ser Zig-Zag	2012-04-09	Can someone please summarize the scene with Littlefinger and crying Ros - I'm totally lost. I have a hearing loss and even with headphones on and the sound cranked, I could not quite make out the entire convo since he whispered the entire thing. Ugh, frustrating! Who was the guy she was supposed to service and didn't? What's the story Littlefinger tells her about? I got the gist of it that she's really upset about the murder of the baby and LF is telling her about another woman (and that's the parts I couldn't hear right) -- would like hearing someone else's take on it.She's traumatized by the baby-killing. Littlefingers acts like he's going to comfort her, putting his arm around her and whispering and such. But then he tells a story about a beautiful Lyseni whore he once bought who acted similarly depressed, and therefore couldn't get customers. "I hate bad investments...they haunt me," he tells Ros. Then he tells how he eventually sold this Lyseni to some Lord who wanted to "transform her", as a way of mitigating Littlefinger's losses. It was all a not-so-veiled threat to Ros: get your act together, youere here to make money, not cry and drive away customers.What he meant by "transform" I don't even want to know. Sounded like some Qyburn shitMy take on it was that they were foreshadowing something that will be revealed later on.Littlefinger said a rich man bought a sad whore. Who do we know that is rich and has a whore who has been "transformed"?

I found him to be a very stern figure and not very sexual at all. In the book he does make a comment to Renly regarding his homosexuality, so I see that, but if someone can help me out on my question I'd appreciate it.I think Davos figures it out. He suspects that Mel and Stannis are having an affair. They do spend a lot of time behind close doors and since Mel is a witch and has a lot of control over Stannis, it's reasonable to assume they are having an affair. Plus, it would make sense for Stannis to try to produce a male heir. He doesn't seem intersted in his wife and while I got the strong sense he didn't particular care for sex, Mel changed his mind. A hot crazy chick will do that I suppose.
288	J_Crews	2012-04-09	In the last production shot from Ireland it shows Bran, Rickon, Osha, and Hodor leaving the ruins of Winterfell. I think Maester Luwin dies as it would be impractical for a person so old to make such a long journey.  The Reeds may appear next season and take Rickon to Skagos whil Osha, Hodor and Bran go north. The reality is that Osha is popular with the TV audience and with the producers they can't write her out for infinity.I still don't know if there will be a Reek . . . Ramsay may be left out completely.Last scene shot does not necessarily mean last scene that airs.  Scenes aren't shot in order.
289	Brewmaster	2012-04-09	I think Davos figures it out. He suspects that Mel and Stannis are having an affair.

Probably because of how dense these books are, often people have trouble picking up on things that arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t explicitly stated. In this world, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not like people are going to actually use the words â<U+0080><U+009C>Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m fucking herâ<U+0080><U+009D>, but Stannis still comes out and admits it to Davos.Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m at work, so I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have the exact passage, but when they talk about how Stannis has taken her into his room at nights, Davos asks him what is going on. Stannis says â<U+0080><U+009C>She comforts meâ<U+0080><U+009D> Davos asks â<U+0080><U+009C>in what wayâ<U+0080><U+009D> and Stannis replies â<U+0080><U+009C>In every wayâ<U+0080><U+009D>.

	Spoiler  Under Storm's End she gives birth to a shadow that Davos recognizes...presumably Stannis. How did the shadow get into her womb? Pretty strong implication for sex
291	Archmaester Marwin	2012-04-09	This episode had great moments and weak moments:
GREAT
1. Ghost. OMG wow looks amazing. Exceeds my wildest expectations.
2. Pyke. Looks bloody phenomenal. Bigger than I expected, much more of a whole castle.
3. Sallador Saan - He was awesome. Not typical blonde Lyseni, but he seemed to have a summer islander vibe with is comments about the holiness of a woman's parts.
4. Lommy suggesting yield, Hot Pie talking about what makes a battle, Yoren, Arya and Gendry's scenes. I'm really liking this plot line. Jaqen was good too.
5. Tyrion and Cersei have great on screen chemistry.
WEAK
1. I thought Janos Slynt was balefully dull. He should have been louder, more obnoxious, and drunker IMO.
2. Littlefinger wiping the whore's mouth. I simply cannot defend this pointless, over the top, filth. I have never complaied about the sexing up of the show before, but that was just nasty. There was no need for it either. He could have wiped her without her being so messy, it would have accomplished the same thing. What, does she have no feeling in her face? WTF.
3. Didn't like Yara. Perhaps I am unfairly comparing her to my mental image of book Asha, but still.
4. Didn't like the sex scene between Mel and Stannis. I think the very last thing we needed at this point in establishing Stannis' hard as iron stubborn honor is a scene of him cracking and forsaking his honor, even if it might have happened.
292	Francisco R. Fonseca	2012-04-09	I think Davos figures it out. He suspects that Mel and Stannis are having an affair.

Thanks.
293	Robin Of House Hill	2012-04-09	Because Asha and Osha sound very much alike in the UK accents that they are using.

It makes sense.  I keep forgetting we are two countries separated by a common language.
294	DannySpud	2012-04-09	Finally!! Sigh, this outage problem is getting ridiculous... 
My thoughts on post-Jon-knocking-out (involving youtube HBO featurettes and the trailer for next ep, so spoiler tagging):
	Spoiler Quorin is definitely in the series, he's in the "new characters of season 2" featurette, and considering his entire point in the books is to escort Jon to the wildlings then sacrifice himself to convince them Jon has turned cloak I imagine the same thing will happen in the show. In the trailer for the next episode it sounds like Craster is kicking them out, I think they'll leave the keep and Mormont will send Quorin, Jon and some redshirts off to infiltrate the others and Jon will separate from the others either the next episode or the one after.

One thing that's really starting to annoy me is the opening credits using the Wall and Vaes Dothrak for Jon and Dany when they aren't at those locations. I want a "The Haunted Forest" and "The Red Waste" and maybe even "The Kingsroad" for Arya.
295	salt	2012-04-09	Plus, it would make sense for Stannis to try to produce a male heir.This is purely an invention of TV, based on nothing from the books.  And Stannis would have no interest in fathering a bastard, something he associated with Robert.
296	Caro99	2012-04-09	*Good things:- I think Lenaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s portrayal of Cersei is awesome. She may be very different from the book Cersei, but Lena acts really good with her version. Her moments with Tyrion are so awesome to watch.- loved the following interactions: Arya/Gendry, Loomy/Hot Pie, Davos/Sallador, Tyrion/Bronn, Sam/Gilly.I really liked the iron islands, which is good since in the books they sort of bored me. But they really put a lot of detail into it, and the actor playing Balon is amazing! I also liked Sallador, he was really funny. Jaqen I think was also great. I pictured him like that in the booksâ<U+0080>¦ okay, maybe not that hot! and Ghost was wonderful! About Stannis & Mel, I didn't mind it that much. It was a good scene, though I certainly had never imagined that Stannis would do that in the painted table- shows how much I know.*Bad things:- I think Davoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s son is a little bit annoying.- The captain's daughter Theon is with... well, why do they show her instead of some important people? We know Theon is horny & a ladyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s man in his way, so why show it yet again..?- Ross & LF. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not that I dislike Ross. I don't, and I think that she was good in this episode with her face expressions as LF subtly threatened her, but she isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t the only one who is unhappy with her situation. I hope that she now makes LF happy so we can see more of Brienne, Sansa, Sandor, Cat in the upcoming chapters...- Bronn being made the commander of the gold cloaks. I love the actor and the character is really funny, but Tyrion does not trust him that much...

They're due to arrive at the Fist of the First Men in episode 5.  I think he'll kill the Halfhand and go double-agent in episode 9; the finale will show him being doubted and generally treated like crap by Rattleshirt; and it will end with the third horn blowing to signal the Others attack on the Fist.

298	frametown	2012-04-09	Regarding the Fist of the First Men, it will definitely be in this season.  In one of the maps that is on the interactive HBO GO version of this episode, the Fist is noted as being northwest of Craster's Keep.  
That makes me think we will be seeing it soon.
299	J_Crews	2012-04-09	This is purely an invention of TV, based on nothing from the books.  And Stannis would have no interest in fathering a bastard, something he associated with Robert.Kings can legitimize bastards with a single signature.
300	teemo	2012-04-09	So is Ros pregnant with one of Robert's bastards or something?  I hope she dies soon.
301	J_Crews	2012-04-09	So is Ros pregnant with one of Robert's bastards or something?I sincerely hope not
302	teemo	2012-04-09	I sincerely hope notI hope not either...but I was thinking of how she looks a little bigger, of that shot in the trailers with Joff/Ros, and Joff is now officially a mass bastard murderer...
303	Balefont	2012-04-09	Kings can legitimize bastards with a single signature.While technically true this is not a strong move for a king to do it for his own bastard.  It wrecks havoc in the lines of succession.Again, as someone stated before, Stannis is such an honorable prude TV Mel's flimsy attempts to sway him in such a way at such an early stage in the game would have been met with disgust rather than lust.  Robert was the weak man who fathered bastards.
304	Winter's Knight	2012-04-09	While technically true this is not a strong move for a king to do it for his own bastard.  It wrecks havoc in the lines of succession.Again, as someone stated before, Stannis is such an honorable prude TV Mel's flimsy attempts to sway him in such a way at such an early stage in the game would have been met with disgust rather than lust.  Robert was the weak man who fathered bastards.Stannis doesn't have any sons, so there's no line of succession to disrupt.
305	Trebla	2012-04-09	On whether Stannis had sex with Mel in the books:A Storm of Swords U.S. paperback pg. 347"Is the brave Ser Onions so frightened of a passing shadow? Take heart, then. Shadows only live when given birth by light, and the king's fires burn so low I dare not draw off anymore to make another son. It might well  kill him." Melissandre moved closer, " With another man, though...a man whose flames still burn hot and high...if you truly wish to serve your king's cause, come to my chamber one night. I could give you pleasure such as you have never known, and with your life-fire I could make..."

I could give you pleasure such as you have never known, and with your life-fire I could make..."She also mentions in the last book that her bed has seen very little use since Stannis marched for Winterfel, so I would say between this detail and that passage you quoted that there is little doubt Stannis was serving tube steak to Melissandre. Not that I think he did it for enjoyment or lust, it was pure duty for him like everything else.
307	The Owl	2012-04-09	I didn't mind the (subtle) changes, in fact I haven't minded them at all....
I am just wondering where the hell they're taking the Jon/Craster sub plot....
308	The Nerdly Knight	2012-04-09	Quite a few things irked me about this episode sadly though overall it was still a nice one.
1) Joffrey ordering the killing of the bastard children. I mean really?
2) The conversation between Tyrion and Varys was very underplayed and a let down.
3) Rorge had a nose
4) Arya/Gendry however have a great thing going in this series and Arya's story has been great so far
5) Someone already said it but did we really need Detective Snow out seeing Other's and getting bopped on the head?
309	Arya The Assassin	2012-04-09	Wow, I finally managed to access the forum (I tried to post here after the second episode aired, but the site has been offline or inaccessible due to heavy traffic).Anyway,Good:Tyrion's scenes are very good, even better than the ones in the first season.The guy who plays Davos Seaworth (sorry, don't remember his name) has been well cast. The actor is good and his persona (or rather the persona he projects onscreen) reminds me of the character from the book. A nice addition to the series.The scene with Balon and Theon. Casting Patrick Malahide as Balon was an excellent choice.Gleeson gets a lot of credit for his role as the despicable Joffrey (and rightly so), but I also think Alfie Allen deserves credit for his role as Theon Greyjoy, a character that I find highly unsympathetic.I was delighted to see Maisie again /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> I liked her brief scene with Jaqen (that actor was spot on) and I look forward to seeing Arya with the Hound and Jaqen later in the season.Kit Harington continues to deliver a consistent and solid performance as Jon Snow.Bad:I don't mind sex scenes per se, but some of them felt a bit 'uninspired'. This is, at least in my opinion, a tough challenge for movies/TV-series in general: Sex scenes are rarely erotic or 'sexy'. Instead the viewers are just waiting for the scene to end so that the plot can make any progress.The writers are trying to do their best to cram several basic plot elements into one episode, and I think they're doing a good job overall. However, the pacing still feels a bit off, and the setting changes a bit to often perhaps. The first episodes in season one faced the same problem (they had to introduce a lot of characters and basic plot elements, exposition, etc.), although I felt that the pacing in those first episodes were handled a bit better.Ros's scene: I really like Ros and the actress who plays her. I don't mind that the writers devote screentime to Ros, but I wish they had written a scene that felt more 'substantial' or important (unless I'm missing something about the scene that makes it more important than it appears to be). This is even more important when pacing and limited running time comes into play.Overall I think this episode was good, although not quite as good as the first one. Nonetheless, I wasn't bored for a second and I think some of the pacing problems will go away after the first episodes. As in the first season, it looks like the second season will need a few episodes before things really start to get exciting (I feel the same way about the books, for that matter, they're slow starters). I think it bodes well that the acting so far (for both new and established characters) in this season has been very solid.
310	Lord Godric	2012-04-09	I've been waiting to comment on this episode since it aired last night, but since most of my thoughts have escaped me in the hours the forums were down I'll briefly say that I loved the episode.  I know a lot of people had concerns particularly with the Dragonstone scenes last week because they felt that not enough was explained.  I thought, and was happily proven right, that they would continue to build on the foundation they had built.  A lot was explained about Davos, Melisandre and Stannis within a short time.  And the actor who plays Davos is fantastic.  He is doing a phenomenal job with the role.
Now, I know a lot of people have problems with "all the changes" but I don't think anything was drastically changed that changes the plot.  Rakharo was killed, but so what?  How does that change the story?  Bronn is the captain of the goldcloaks, again, does not change the story.  Stannis had only stillborn sons but that doesn't mean he never had any daughters, so Shireen is probably lurking somewhere offscreen with Patchface.  People really need to get over small changes like these.  As long as the story is not changed and characters still maintain the same essence with which Martin created them, then the changes in this adaptation are acceptable.
311	bloodymime	2012-04-09	Maybe they're combining Stannis' wife and daughter. I don't remember the the book wife as sickly and weak or being stuck in a tower the way Mel talked about her.
312	teemo	2012-04-09	Maybe they're combining Stannis' wife and daughter. I don't remember the the book wife as sickly and weak or being stuck in a tower the way Mel talked about her.Yeah, Selyse's not sickly or weak IIRC....that's Lysa...
313	The Faceless Bard	2012-04-09	I was ok with the Theon Sex scene only because it contrasted his arrival on Pyke... he went from the future king and that girls wet dream to a nobody in 60 seconds, and it was awesome
314	congokong	2012-04-09	Ch-ch-changes...
There's really too many differences from the books to even keep track at this point. I just hope by next season they don't barely follow the book at all like True Blood.
Changes off the top of my head:
-Davos being an agnostic instead of Stannis
-Sallador arguing about whether he will rape or just take Cersei
-Arya being unable to keep a secret
-Joffrey being even more of a dick than he was in the books while Cersei gets more sympathy
-Killing off Daenerys' bloodrider (and she lost Silver last episode too)
-Wasting good screen time with another useless Ros scene with Petyr just so we can remember that Petyr is evil (no shit)
-Craster being stupid enough to give a sacrifice while he has 200 guests in his one room house
We already knew that Stannis was doing Melisandre...
315	BabyMeraxes	2012-04-09	BABY SHEREEN!!!!!!!!!!!! This is what I'm most upset about. There go my chances of seeing greyscale, and I was really looking forward to watching Patchface act like a creep. 
Otherwise, everything was great. Arya was great, the Greyjoys were great,  Cersei is doing a great job becoming that asshole we know and love her to be.
I'm just going to say this right now: I like book-Tyrion way more than show-Tyrion.
316	Spooky Scary Jurble	2012-04-09	I can't think of a reason why it would not fit, personally.  I think you are overestimating the differences in cultural mindset between the middle ages and these days.  If anything, people back then would be more aware of how optional belief in deities actually is. No, you're wrong.  Read some historical books on the subject.
317	Vikingkingq	2012-04-09	It certainly very hasty, I'll grant you that. But we don't really know what motivates Stannis to sleep with her in the novel, so I suppose the whispered promise of a son might be all it takes. It does make me wonder how they'll deal with it when a son isn't exactly forthcoming -- not the sort of son Stannis imagined he'd get, anyways.Melisandre has been explicit in ASoS that she births her shadows by sleeping with Stannis -- she tries to get Davos to sleep with her because Stannis's energies are depleted, so to speak. And yes, ADwD makes it even clearer. My interpretation is that the son isn't the primary motivation; it's what he needs to get over the wife thing. The primary motivation is victory in war.
318	Morrigan	2012-04-09	My own nerdrage thoughts about episode 2.What I liked:- Arya and Gendry! <3- Jaqen, though it was painfully brief. Can't wait to see more of him.- Yoren being all badass. Loved it, true to the book too.- Tyrion vs Janos Slynt.- Random Ironborn giving Theon the cold shoulder + Balon putting Theon back in his place. Take that, Greyjoy. Also, Pyke looked great.- Sallador Saan was memorable and funny. Good for him.- Varys and his "I keep on paddling" line. Yay! Glad they kept that.- GHOOOOOOOOOST! \m/What was cool-but-should-have-been-better:- Theon and Yara Asha. I'm not sold on the actress playing Asha yet (she doesn't look like the bold, cocky, badass woman I read about), and I thought the scene was a lot funnier in the books...- Tyrion vs Cersei. In the books he confronts her with the incest before the rumours spread. He appears less clever now since the viewers can't tell he already knew about it. Also, no slap-fest. Boo.- Dolorous Edd is always amusing, but fart jokes? Really, HBO? You didn't want to use GRRM's witticisms from the books, so you replace them with... fart jokes. Meh.- Needs moar Arya.- Boo, no Shireen. /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />  And I think it was too soon to see Stannis and Melisandre having it on. We know it happened (off-screen) in the books and I don't mind that they show it, but for non-readers it seems that it's just yet-another-sex-scene.What I didn't like:- WTF, Rakharo? He doesn't die in the books. Gratuitous death? I know the bloodriders are all kind of interchangeable, but still...- I know the Theon/captain's daughter scene is in the book but that's actually something that could have been cut since Theon already had a "sexposition" scene (totally made up for the TV version) with Ros in S1. But hey, they probably thought, moar sex = good!- Changing the orders about the bastard's purge as coming from Joffrey instead of Cersei. Stupid. Joffrey's already a Complete Monster, no need to pile on.- The constant softcore porn is getting tiring and just gives more ammo to the detractors. And that mouth-wiping, really? Grow up, D&D. /rolleyes.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' />- Everything involving Ros and Littlefinger. Ugh, worst character adaptation ever? I was thrilled when Carcetti from the Wire was cast, but I hate how they wrote Baelish for the TV show. He's a creep but not THAT kind of creep (the voyeurism was just too much). And we already know he's greedy and ruthless, this was just mustache-twirling stupidity. And to add insult to injury, that scene lasted longer than the Daenerys scene (and it also meant no screen time for Sansa, the Hound, Catelyn and Robb, etc.) while being complete and utter filler. Pointless, stupid, F U D&D, you guys are hack writers and the only reason the show's still good is because of the source material being that good. Seriously. (Yeah, yeah, I is mad brah!)The artificial cliff-hanger:  I can understand why we had to catch Craster throwing his kids to the Others?  But why the lame cliff-hanger?  ZOMG!  I wonder what happened?Actually, I do wonder what will happen. Not in the "is Jon okay???" sense, obviously, but I didn't really get what they were going for with Craster knocking Jon out (also, that "blow to the head = instant KO" clichA© needs to die, plz). I assume that Jon will wake up the next morning in his camp, will try to tell Mormont what he saw and Craster will tell him he must have dreamed it or something, but that people will start muttering about Craster to foreshadow the later mutiny. But that's just my speculation.

319	DannySpud	2012-04-10	My two pence on the Jon stuff (I posted this in the cliffhanger thread)People are saying it is a bit of a coincidence that someone had a baby right when the NW were there, I don't think it is. I think the baby was already around and Craster gave it to the Others to protect the NW. Then next episode I can imagine Jon telling Mormont, Mormont confronting Craster about it, Craster explaining, and Mormont being pissed. Then Craster kicks them out for being ungrateful.
320	James Arryn	2012-04-10	I do agree they seem to reach for sex as a constant bridge...not as subtly as Rome or Deadwood. Doesn't bother me, but it's where you don't wonder where they're going to go with certain scenes/conflicts/interactions anymore. Just kinda ''so how long until she takes...oh, ok."
I think GGRM's sex scenes weren't written all that well...the show's sex scenes are a little more effective, but still slightly obvious and as I said, beginning to be predictable.

321	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2012-04-10	So is Ros pregnant with one of Robert's bastards or something?  I hope she dies soon.No.

322	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2012-04-10	This is purely an invention of TV, based on nothing from the books.  And Stannis would have no interest in fathering a bastard, something he associated with Robert.I think that had less to do with an heir and more to do with a sexually repressed, unattractive man with a good looking naked woman grabbing his junk.
323	smo	2012-04-10	Just to throw my two cents in because I can... I really enjoyed the episode.  I really look at the books and the tv series as two different things.  I do not expect the tv series to follow the books to the letter.  That would be impossible.  I look forward to seeing how the story line plays out, both within the books themselves and the tv series.

325	Knez Snow	2012-04-10	Great episode. Arya, Gendry, Grayjoys, Cersei all were great. I am ok with Littlefinger's added scenes. Seems Ros will be filling rolls of bunch of side-characters so that makes her good addition to the show (Alayaya, Chataya, i even have this wierd feeling she might be Jayne although that is a very long shot considering her and Arya's age)
I can't tell, are Lommy and Hot Pie recast or not?
326	DannySpud	2012-04-10	Seems Ros will be filling rolls of bunch of side-characters so that makes her good addition to the show (Alayaya, Chataya, i even have this wierd feeling she might be Jayne although that is a very long shot considering her and Arya's age)I don't understand!! Why are so many people independently coming up with this theory? This can't happen, they are too different in age. Jeyne has been cast as well so there's no need. Why?? AAAHHHH!! *breaks down into tears*
327	BlackTalon	2012-04-10	I really liked the episode generally, but ...
Yara. She might be able to pull off Asha from her type and her acting, but she DOES look a bit doughy and pasty faced. No ways somebody would look like this who basically spends his whole life in an open longboat on the sea. She hasnÂ´t got the look of a warrior.
What on earth was that last Jon scene about. I have absolutely no idea where they are planning on going from there but I am already lowering my expectations.
328	Knez Snow	2012-04-10	I don't understand!! Why are so many people independently coming up with this theory? This can't happen, they are too different in age. Jeyne has been cast as well so there's no need. Why?? AAAHHHH!! *breaks down into tears*Well it probably won't happen, but Jayne wasn't casted. Untill they actully say characters name in episode, or character gets some defining action (like Tommen, being blond and at the same table with Lannisters)  they don't count. Because they can (and will) recast them.They also need someone who can do nude scenes (if they chose that direction, we still don't even have Ramsy so we cannot know, and what will Theon do for like 2 seasons.). There is a question how will they introduce character of Jayne (probably Littlefinger just randomly finding someone who we are told is Sansa's friend Jayne?).Maybe they will send Jayne Westerling (Lannister?) but i don't know would I like that. Most likely, because of how D&D reacted to question -is that girl in season1 episode1 Jayne Poole-, they will just "recast" her and go that way.They changed Asha to Yara because its close to Osha. And they will have 2 Jaynes, unless they change something again. Sansa mentioned "Jayne Poole's mother" in season 1.Interesting question, is Ros going to have a full, new story arc now? Whose roles will she take over? What part in Littlefinger's plots will she take?  I can't imagine her just earning him money.
329	Lady Olenna	2012-04-10	Asha/Yara was not what I expected BUT I got over that quickly when she was standing next to Balon - they almost look like they could be related - they seemed very in sync with each other and played the scene so well. Balon is exactly what I pictured and just nailed the role. I thought Theon was excellent in this episode. He looked like a little boy lost and looking for a place to belong. 
Joff. Cersei and Tyrion always seem to get their roles spot on. Cersei and Tyrion are so great together. 
Varys as always was perfect. 
I don't know what they are doing to Littlefinger but I'm holding out that they will do him justice. 
Still don't like the Ros scenes. 
Arya and the bunch were great. Yorenade me laugh. Not sure about Biter and Rorge yet. 
Ok... Big disappointment is still Stannis/Mel. I'm just not feeling it. I love Davos and Saan but I just don't enjoy watching the way Mel and Stannis are portrayed. I hope they change my opinion. 
I'm not sure about Craster/Jon yet. I will wait until next episode to decide that one. My tv's for whatever reason are so dark that the last scene is almost black and I can't even really tell what's going on. But I get the idea. 
Ive got my fingers crossed that Shireen, Patchface and Mormonts crow will make a future appearance.
330	DannySpud	2012-04-10	Well it probably won't happen, but Jayne wasn't casted. Untill they actully say characters name in episode, or character gets some defining action (like Tommen, being blond and at the same table with Lannisters)  they don't count.

Whose roles will she take over? What part in Littlefinger's plots will she take?  I can't imagine her just earning him money.Even if they recast Jeyne, they won't just use Ros. The age difference is just too big, it would completely take away from the show if characters somehow forgot Arya wasn't Ned's oldest child by a decade. The only benefit I can see to Jeyne being Ros is that the audience will recognise her. But seeing as Reek-rhymes-with-meek recognises her it doesn't take much more than a "that's Jeyne, Sansa's best friend from Winterfell" from him to establish who she is.
331	Honey Badger	2012-04-10	Ros I'm starting to lose the faith.  A hot ass actress but she has to justify her presence.
Yara worked well.  Those who say she isn't hot enough have filled in the blanks regarding Asha.  Remember she's supposed to be tomboyish and not objectively hot, but makes men wild by being confident in command and outrageous.  This actress seemed to work when keeping a smirk while letting Theon finger her.  The book Asha was equally as calculating.  Only thing is she's a bit chubby for an Ironborn, but no big deal.
Salt wife on the boat worked as well.  Incredibly pitiful creature; nailed that small role perfectly.  
Cersei and Tyrion had a good back and forth.  Hating the Imp for killing his mother was more Tywin's gig, but I always figured Cersei hated him for that too.  Being a dwarf had to be embarrassing for the proud Lannisters, which both she and Tywin would have felt.  Jaime was the one who didn't care and loved his little brother.
Stannis was okay but I'm not liking the sex scene.  This show reveals too much.  As a reader I liked the subtlety of guessing and piecing the evidence together.  The show gives the viewer no intellectual respect.  They need to be The Wire and leave more things left unsaid.  Instead everything gets beaten over our heads because they're worried the (admittedly larger) audience can't keep up.
332	Hear Us Roar	2012-04-10	Ros' role is to run the prostitution madam angle that happen frequently in the books. She helps flesh out Little finger and as we know Tyrion practically lives in whorehouses. So she fills a double purpose for the series.
333	The Knight of Grasses	2012-04-10	A good episode, but still one of my least favorites.  Briefly:
Likes: Arya/Gendry, Yoren (such a badass), Pyke, Tyrion/anyone, Night's Watch scenes
Dislikes: Stannis, Brothel scene
Again, overall I still enjoyed it, but I'll focus on the one thing that bothered me.  Stannis is wrong.  I didn't like the physical look of him last week, although his characterization was alright.  But the thing with Mel just threw his whole character off.  While I certainly wouldn't be upset if they toned down the sex in the show, that's not the reason I disliked the inclusion of that scene.  Nor does it have anything to do with being a book purist, which I don't think I am.
It's that it seems to establish Stannis as something far different from what he is in the books.  Yes, it's hinted at in the books that he's slept with Mel (although before now, I never treated it as a certainty), but before we learn about possible infidelity, we learn about what a hard, uncompromising man he is.  I feel like that stern-ness will be much harder to establish in the show now that he's an adulterer willing to cast his vows and honor aside for a naked priestess.
I think GRRM kept the Stannis/Mel thing muted for the very purpose of not casting Stannis as a giant hypocrite.  We were meant to focus on his dutiful, principled leadership and reluctant religiosity; his strict adherence to rule of law.  Conversely, in the show, everything he does from here on out is framed by that scene with Mel.  Conceivably, it's necessary to the show's version of Stannis and I'll come to accept it.  But Stannis has been, by far, the most disappointing character adaptation from the first one-plus seasons.  Maybe the only one.
334	redriver	2012-04-10	I think the Stannis portrayal is pretty much accurate.The Stannis I recall in the early books is pretty much a man in thrall to Mel,and cold, and not lovable.
This is what we get.If and when Stannis turns badass,I'm sure we will get that too.

335	Elundin	2012-04-10	Yes, Ghost+ Jon is like Drizzt+ Gwenyiver. Him without the giant bundle of happiness is plainly wrong. Stannis panding of lust is wrong (but then again thats how babies are born). Bronn as captain of the city watch is also wrong (but then again one more character would be confusing). The entire brothel scene is wrong (but then again a little boobie never hurt noone). Rhakaro dead is wrong (but then again he can be easily replaced, plus its one less character to remember a name for).
On the other hand, Pyke was excellent cinematography. Balon was excellent portraying. Sallador was oh so good. Tyrion+ Cersei and Tyrion+ Janos and Tyrion+ Varys (Tyrion always gets the best scenes/lines) was excellent. Arya+ Gendry and the rest of the kids was funny. Jaqar was something to look forward to.
Also the scene with Jon and Sam really helps towards building understanding of what Jon becomes.
All in all? I have to rewatch to decide whether I liked or not. I'm torn at the moment.
336	girlfrommonday	2012-04-10	Because Asha and Osha sound very much alike in the UK accents that they are using.  Using standard IPA notation, we might well have these pairs:Asha: U.S. /ËA¦EÉ<U+0099>/, U.K. /ËÉ<U+0091>ËEÉ<U+0099>/Osha: U.S. /ËÉ<U+0094>ËEÉ<U+0099>/, U.K. /ËÉ<U+0092>ËEÉ<U+0099>/Surely you can see that while the U.S. pronunciations are reasonably far apart, the U.K. pronunciations that they would necessarily be using are really rather similar. Yes, there are other U.K. possibilities, but those given above are the most likely ones, and itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s way too close â<U+0080><U+0094> much much closer, say, than the cited counterexample of Arya and Yara.although I understand the argument of pronunciation, I am not conviced aboud the idea. Asha and Osha are never on the screen on the same time, they are in different parts of the Westeros, they have different storylines, they even don't look alike... Is it so unusual, that two people on the huge continent have quite similar names?
337	Peach Fuzz	2012-04-10	Stannis and Melisandre was cringing i prefered it in the books where its heavily implied he s laying with her. Also when she mentioned ill give you a son she was talking about shadow babies i thought Stannis didnt know about them.
The Asha theon scene was funny she isnt as pretty as i pictured her but she did look alot like Balon Greyjoy.
338	boojam	2012-04-10	Tyrion has an inner monologue/thinks , that Varys's visit was a hidden threat, a message to him, like " i know whta you're hiding and since you're hiding it, then i know it means much to you"Don't remember that , but sure it's there.What I remember is Varys helping Tyrion hide her and , I may have this wrong, helping in moving her to the RK.In fact being on Tyrions  side all the way.I did notice in the dialog in the show , twice, that Shae is mention as working in the kitchen, so maybe she's not in Tyrion's quarters all the time?

In a sea of 30+ different distinct characters, you don't think the average person might get them confused?
340	boojam	2012-04-10	I've got a question.  The others haven't been seen for 8,000 years, yet Craster is giving his sons to them and has presumbly been doing so for years.  Were they just waiting till they had enough of Craster's sons to create an army?  The rangers have been visiting Craster for years but only now the others are going after everyone.I always got the impression that its those south of the wall who had relegated the Others to mythology, and that the wildlings (I guess it's never stated explicitly) had never done that, even when the Others were dormant.How Craster figured out what to do is left as a mystery, but it seems something a wildling could figure out.Just why it placates the Others is never explained, seems to me sooner or later Craster's offerings are not going to make one wit's worth of differences and he and his following will be wiped out.
341	redriver	2012-04-10	Yoren- "I sharpened my knife before breakfast.I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to".Another genius line.
Arya looks Japanese anime with those big eyes.
Alton Lannister looks very like Gendry.Related in real life?
342	Songlian	2012-04-10	Haven't read all 18 pages of this thread, but are we sure Rakharo is dead? There was something about that scene, like not quite showing his head out of that bag, that made me thinking they might be trying to pull something up.
Dunno. Not in denial or anything, just seems odd to kill a character that lives all the way to ADWD.

343	boojam	2012-04-10	I know some people have complained about the Stannis and Melisandre scene, but I think if you pay close attention to what happens in that scene, it plays out exactly as it must have happened:Stannis says that he can't beat 110,000 men with 5,000 men and that he needs Renly's army to win (true)Melisandre replies "I have seen the path to victory in the flames" (true), "but first you must give yourself to the Lord of Light."Stannis thinks she's talking just about his rather...unenthusiastic conversion.Melisandre says "you must give all of yourself." (meaning his shadow)And then she only brings up the son (which is true, she's going to give him a shadowbaby) to get him over the hump of betraying his wife.To me, this perfectly fits the books - Melisandre is just vague enough that Stannis doesn't have to think that he's killing his brother with sorcery, and she couches the conception first and foremost as a requirement of victory based in religion.That is excellent.I did not catch that until I viewed the scene the second time.Well one is going to have to be a very sharp non-reader to catch the drift of what is going on.D&D's writing seems to have even gone over the heads of readers! And people here complain about the lack of subtlety in the teleplay.Even me. Gonna have to pay closer attention!

345	TheRiderThatMounts	2012-04-10	I did not really like the changes but I'm really curious to see how they will use them. Maybe all these changes will add something nice.
I love GRRM's characters. I was actually really dissapointed when I saw lord Tywin and he was not bald with sideburns. Not to get me wrong, Charles Dance is a great actor and he plays a great Tywin but still, the no-hair-huge-sideburns look was something that defined lord Tywin. It said all or nothing and it helped the character a lot.
This is why I'm not ok with the way they portrayed Stannis. He would have never jumped Melisandre's bones like that. The man hates whores and the idea of sex. To him it's just duty.
The way they showed it, it was like he was seduced by the promise of a son. And Stannis is not easily seduced.
Also, did they cut his daughter from the show?
I was also sad to see them kill of Rakharo. I understand that the actor left the show to play in World War Z. I don't understand why they had to kill the character since the GRRM clarly says in the books that Rakharo grows into a man, taller, more muscular. They could have used some other actor.
346	boojam	2012-04-10	But how on earth can a woman in her 30s take the place of a girl that is 14 and looks even younger??Will all the book readers get over the 'age thing'!That ship has sailed!The show is bound by labor laws.... and even an adult TV HBO can't violate various laws about child actors, especially their presentation in a visual medium.(What George used as a template will , and cannot, fly in contemporary visual drama, in fact I don't think it can ever be done , even at some future date.)
347	Balefont	2012-04-10	Stannis is one of the major characters in the whole story and particularly in Clash and I just feel they totally missed the boat with the TV version.  I'm curious to see how it gets "fixed" but so far the character is complexity flat and non-threatening.

Most of the viewers , right now, speak North American English (my nod to Canadians)... and lord viewers in  Western Europe and Eastern Europe, how are they going get confused?One would think UK viewers are sophisticated enough to figure it out, the Irish and Scottish would get confused?I still want to hear George asked the question... he approve? Maybe he so happy with getting 99.99 percent of it right he looks the other way?
350	boojam	2012-04-10	Also George said at some point (to lazy to search out the quote) that he should have made the children older in the first place (after he realised the 4 years gap wouldn't work out)You know if this show continues, here we still sit on pins and needles!, the four year gap will take care of itself, hell it could a 6 year gap! They are not going to recast excellent actors , that would be crazy.Not to mention fans arriving at HBO's doors with pitch forks and torches!
351	redriver	2012-04-10	From an Irish perspective,no confusion.No real need for the name change.
Then again the name change is no big deal to me.

That's all good, but it has nothing to do with the fact that Ros can not pass for Arya under any circustances ever. The age gap is too big, they look nothing alike, and she wouldn't have the first clue how to act like the daughter of Lord Stark. It would be a completely ridiculous plot development. Why would Roose accept her? Any girl of a close age to Arya would serve his goal way better.
354	Ran	2012-04-10	Yeah, Ros is not taking the Jeyne role. Either they'll do something else with it or they'll just introduce Jeyne, "Oh, yeah, she was in Winterfell and was Sansa's friend and just accept she was there." George has mentioned this sort of thing before, when talking about the Sopranos and the way suddenly some lieutenant of Tony's exists on the show and is a major player even though you've never seen him or even had him mentioned before. Just have to accept it.
But yeah, Ros is definitely not going to try and be passed off as Arya,
355	K-Raptor	2012-04-10	I liked how Melisandre whispers to Matthos that "death by fire is the purest death". Considering he dies during the Battle of the Blackwater.
The Arya storyline was great as well. Hot Pie + Lommy Greenhands so far have made a great impression on me. Jaqen was good as well. I like how they pronounce Jaqen H'gar. Much better than what I had in mind.
356	Greywolf2375	2012-04-10	Will all the book readers get over the 'age thing'!That ship has sailed!The show is bound by labor laws.... and even an adult TV HBO can't violate various laws about child actors, especially their presentation in a visual medium.(What George used as a template will , and cannot, fly in contemporary visual drama, in fact I don't think it can ever be done , even at some future date.)Her argument has nothing to do with book age v. show age - read what she said.  This was about Ros being used in place of Jeyne as fake Arya.  There really isn't any argument that a 30ish buxom redhead can't replace a 14ish slim brunette and not have any question the sudden change in appearance.  Your outrage about people who read though is noted.
357	legba11	2012-04-10	At least it's not just me who cannot get on the forums most of time...
Jon's story is still going to play out similar to how it does in CoK.  Ygritte is coming, The Half-Hand is a "major" new character.  We see them climbing and fighting together.  Sadly, I think this will get played out as a cheap cliff-hanger, where the world gets reset (to normal) quickly next week.  Something like Ghost find him (and the dragonglass) and they leave Craster's without him knowing Jon survived.  It won't matter on the way back as Jon isn't with them anyway.
Stannis and Mel had sex in the books.  There is no doubt about that, That scene is likely how it happened.  Stannis does NOT know she is hatching a demon fetus to kill Renly (and the steward of Storm's End).  (There is no indication of this, he has no idea what happened to Renly).
LF's speech served two parts, once again it shows the audience what type of guy he is underneath the fancy clothes.  It also serves to be putting Ros in the right place to run his moneymaker when he leaves.  He knows KL is about to become real dangerous and knows he needs to get out.  LF is a survivor.  Jofferey/Cersei in charge would make any person nervous about their survival.  Stannis or Renly are going to attack the city soon and it's currently defended by some poorly trained cops and (at that time) led by a man who would not be hard for the invaders to buy off.  There's a reason he decides to continue playing The Game from outside KL for nearly the rest of the books.
358	shadow of death	2012-04-10	With the stannis/mel sex scene.  In the books it is easier to imply what is going on.  Sometimes on the show they do need to hit the viewers on the head to make it more obvious.  Hey and with a body like that even Stannis would give in.  Stannis is obviously a major character in the books so i am holding judgement on him until he has some more screen time.  In the books he kinda grows on you.
Asha was not how i pictured her.  I figured she was sort of lanky and wiry but pretty in a tomboy sort of way.  Her and theon actually look like siblings though.
Littlefinger is not really how he is in the books.  Maybe they are protraying him like this so when it is revealed more that he is a major player people will realize how smart he is.
359	Milcov	2012-04-10	Good:
Salladhor Saan
Balon Greyjoy
The captains daughter on Theon's ship was done well
Tyrion dismissing Slynt was brilliant
Joff killing the bastards
Gendry and Arya
Clearing up early that Craster sacrifices sons
Bad:
Out of character Stannis
Rakharo (though maybe unavoidable)
Littlefinger just being a pimp
Ros shouldn't be servicing clients if she's manager
Jon getting knocked out
360	Songlian	2012-04-10	Yes.It states in the English translation of the Dothraki that "Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight".Thank you! That's not quite what I meant, though. I know everyone thinks it's Rakharo... but based on the fact that Jorah saw what? A bit of hair and a ponytail? I just find it curious that in a show with so much gore/violence/etc, they shy from showing us his face.Eh. I'm probably just making a big case from nothing.
361	dtones520	2012-04-10	Thank you! That's not quite what I meant, though. I know everyone thinks it's Rakharo... but based on the fact that Jorah saw what? A bit of hair and a ponytail? I just find it curious that in a show with so much gore/violence/etc, they shy from showing us his face.Eh. I'm probably just making a big case from nothing.I think the reason they dont show the face is because it is super expensive to make a replica fake head. Apparently GRRM wanted them to make one of him to put up on the spikes in the Sansa/Joffrey scene in season one, but was tolf they couldnt do any more exact replicas due to budget stuff. So, im guessing, that they had a bunch of prop severed heads, put a wig on it that looked lime Rakharos hair and didnt show the face. No need to screw up your budget for a minor character especially when you have a high budget episode like Blackwater.
362	boojam	2012-04-10	Yeah, Ros is not taking the Jeyne role. Either they'll do something else with it or they'll just introduce Jeyne, "Oh, yeah, she was in Winterfell and was Sansa's friend and just accept she was there." George has mentioned this sort of thing before, when talking about the Sopranos and the way suddenly some lieutenant of Tony's exists on the show and is a major player even though you've never seen him or even had him mentioned before. Just have to accept it.But yeah, Ros is definitely not going to try and be passed off as Arya,Ok , surely someone has mentioned this, D&D in the commentary for season on , DVD, point out Jeyne Poole at but is the actress ever given credit, can't find her on IMDB.There is a picture of her on the Wiki.
363	dtones520	2012-04-10	Why do people keep calling the Stannis scene out of character? We all know he sleeps with Melisandre from the heavy, heavy implications in the books. So, what character did he go against? Stannis is a dutiful man bent on justice. He was reluctant to nail Melisandre in the show, but they cant put in 10 scenes of him turning her down before it actually happens. Without seeing that they did it the shadow baby scene becomes a bit confusing. It highlights Mels power over Stannis, which she has in the books.
364	dtones520	2012-04-10	Ok , surely someone has mentioned this, D&D in the commentary for season on , DVD, point out Jeyne Poole at but is the actress ever given credit, can't find her on IMDB.There is a picture of her on the Wiki.You only see her once at the Winterfell feast for the king. I dont think we see Jeyne in the series until we get to ADWD.
365	boojam	2012-04-10	You only see her once at the Winterfell feast for the king. I dont think we see Jeyne in the series until we get to ADWD.Just my opinion, frankly the whole Jeyne Poole arc seems over elaborated to me, sure it's important to Theon's arc at the end of ADwD ,... tho that whole narrative could have been orchestrated without Jeyne, seems he was coming back to his senses anyway.
366	The Last Dragon	2012-04-10	Just my opinion, frankly the whole Jeyne Poole arc seems over elaborated to me, sure it's important to Theon's arc at the end of ADwD ,... tho that whole narrative could have been orchestrated without Jeyne, seems he was coming back to his senses anyway.Well, the whole Jeyne Poole/Fake Arya has some more importance then only Theon his story arc. It is the whole reason Jon does what he does and the end of ADwD. But the producers have about 4 more years to come up with a plausible change of story.
367	theWesterosi	2012-04-10	Stannis sleeping with Melisandre had to be shown. Not much of the audience would be able to deduce that Stannis slept with Melisandre by just seeing a shadow being spawned out of her.

369	Catelyn	2012-04-10	Well...I actually didn't imagine Asha as she is in the shows but overall i think her attitude is quite similar to the one described in the books.
I really didn't like neither Jon being knocked out by Craster at the end of episode nor Rakharo being killed. Maybe it is necessary to let the audience understand the other Khals are against Daenerys...but still.
Also too much space is given to Littlefinger. I know they have to make the audience aware of the fact that he's a really important and smart character, that he moves everything and everyone around him but this is shown just at the end of ASOS and in a AFFC, not before, not really I mean.
I don't know what you guys think about this, but seriously too much Littlefinger!
370	Songlian	2012-04-10	I think the reason they dont show the face is because it is super expensive to make a replica fake head.Had no idea that it's so expensive to make fake heads. But it makes sense to save every penny, if that's the case. Thank you!
371	girlfrommonday	2012-04-10	They're both women in their late twenties/early thirties, they're both dressed plainly, they both have some martial skill (Asha more than Osha).  In a sea of 30+ different distinct characters, you don't think the average person might get them confused?I honestly don't think so. It's like saying, that people will confuse Sansa with Margaery if they have the same name: both young and pretty, both dressed like a lady.As I said before: Asha and Osha are not similar (different type of beauty) and even if someone, for example Theon will speak of Asha, careful viewer should have no problem with understanding who he's talking about. If he/she is not careful, well, probably is confused already with the story.It's all goofy. Most of the viewers , right now, speak North American English (my nod to Canadians)... and lord viewers in Western Europe and Eastern Europe, how are they going get confused? One would think UK viewers are sophisticated enough to figure it out, the Irish and Scottish would get confused? I still want to hear George asked the question... he approve? Maybe he so happy with getting 99.99 percent of it right he looks the other way?My native language is Polish and here pronunciation Asha/Osha is very similar. But come on we are not stupid/deaf and it's not like this is the only pair of words that sounds alike /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
372	WinterfellRose	2012-04-10	As I said before: Asha and Osha are not similar (different type of beauty) and even if someone, for example Theon will speak of Asha, careful viewer should have no problem with understanding who he's talking about. If he/she is not careful, well, probably is confused already with the story.From the various trailers we've seen, it seems that Theon will be seduced by Osha later in Winterfell. Maybe that is where it might get confusing when he calls her Osha. If he had been speaking of Asha previously as his sister..... Just what came to my mind...
373	JayDubya	2012-04-10	I honestly don't think so. It's like saying, that people will confuse Sansa with Margaery if they have the same name: both young and pretty, both dressed like a lady.Ok, then let me say that:  If Sansa and Margaery had the same name (or they had the names Sansa and Sonsa), a lot of people would get confused.   Not you, not me, but a lot of normal people who don't have very good memories, and/or haven't read the books would get them mixed up.
374	JayDubya	2012-04-10	People confuse Asha with Osha!As someone noted they never appear in the same scene together across the 5 novels, so far.And even if they did they have a totally different visual appearance.I don't think it's D&D , someone at HBO has the auditory discriminatory neurons of a blind cave fish.I have a general rule that I follow...   If I've never ever done something, and someone else has years of experience in that field, then I assume that, even if I don't understand why it's been done, that the expert has a good reason.  I mean... why do calculators have + signs on them?  Who can't add numbers in their heads?  Why would anyone need a device to help them add things?   Why do toothpicks have instructions on the box?  Who could possibly be so dumb as to not understand what a toothpick is for?   Why did Sony invent a form of DRM that can be eliminated with a magic marker?  What possible person thought that was a good idea?  The fact is, that these things were not done in a vacuum.  They didn't magically appear one day.  Someone made a specific effort to pursue a strategy and implement a change.   Just because I don't understand the reason, doesn't mean the reason is stupid.  It is far, far more likely that I'm simply ignorant of the reason.    If I were to educate myself, and become an expert in the field, then, perhaps, I can render an educated assessment of the intelligence (or lack thereof) of the decision and the person making the decision.Until that point, I continue to work under the assumption that I am lacking data.  Because me assuming that someone has the 'auditory discriminatory neurons of a blind cave fish' because they made a decision that I don't understand approaches the heights of callow arrogance.
375	theMountainGoat	2012-04-10	Perhaps my experience of episode 2 was coloured by the fact that I was in a pub with 30 other fans and sat three feet away from George RR Martin, but I think I'd still think this was a brilliant episode had I been on my own at home.
So many of the scenes used dialogue straight out of the book and everything looked great, especially Pyke. I definitely prefer it when some characters are left out so the show can put a greater focus on the storylines they are following that week. It works so much better. I was surprised there was no Renly this week but I'm sure there will be a big chunk of his story in episode 3.
The only thing I didn't really like was the whole Yara/Asha thing but we knew about that long ago and it's already been argued to death. The gratuitous sex was gratuitous but is fast becoming the norm for this show. I did not mind the Ros/Littlefinger scene this week to be honest because we saw a different side to her character which felt like the right choice for her, although I do think it's a little incongruous with the previous episode where she appeared to have become the madam of the brothel and now she is back to being just another whore.
I think making Bronn the captain of the goldcloaks is actually a really interesting change. I was surprised because I thought that Jacelyn Bywater had been cast but perhaps I am mistaken. It does make me wonder if they are going to keep Bronn around instead of having him disappear off to Stokeworth, but he's such a great character I don't think I'd mind if they do go that way. Also I'm glad they kept in the line about how much since that tells you everything you ever need to know about Bronn.
The end of the episode was so awesome I can't believe that scene wasn't in the book. The absence of the Others in the second book has always been a strange choice and for the TV show we definitely needed that reminder that the White Walkers are still out there. I got chills when I heard the ice cracking language echoing through the trees and the visual of the White Walker picking up the baby and walking away was creepy and beautiful. It will be interesting to see how they handle Jon Snow waking up next week. Will they have already left Craster's when he awakes in a litter or will he awake in the midst of Craster and Mormont arguing. If I had one complaint about it I'd say the fact that they had not established that there was a newborn baby son in the household when the Night's Watch arrived made it seem like the baby came out of nowhere. Just one line about a pregnant daughter about to give birth or Gilly saying something about her sister giving birth to a son yesterday might have helped with that. And yes Ghost looked awesome.
Overall it really was a fantastic episode, a great improvement on the first episode which I thought was awkward and had some poorly thought out ideas. I know George liked it and was happy to see so many fans enjoying it in person. He had already seen the first two episodes before they aired so we did not get to see any reaction from him as he watched but George has not seen any of the other episodes yet. I'm not sure if he will be able to watch episode 3 when he is in Portugal next week but if anyone finds him in a bar watching it you may get to see his reaction, although I suspect he may wait till he gets back home before watching it.
376	DemiNymph	2012-04-10	Ros, sucks. When are they killing her off? What a waste of time. Why do we need to know about this character? Stop giving her air time. Who did this actress fuck to get on the show? 
How is Stannis out of character? People forget that in the books we see Stannis through Davos' POV, not Stannis's own POV. We will never be able to know what exactly Stannis feel or think, just what Davos thinks of him. You are reading Davos' guesses and perceptions. Just like any 2nd hand information, it may or may not be accurate.

I got chills when I heard the ice cracking language echoing through the trees and the visual of the White Walker picking up the baby and walking away was creepy and beautiful.Slightly off-topic terminology check: does 'White Walkers' encompass both Others and Wights, or does it only refer to one or the other?And yes, I'm astonished that anyone would complain about this because it wasn't in the book. We got to see an Other for Gods sake.I enjoyed the episode, you could still tell that the task of setting up new characters and plots was paramount, but at this rate I think they'll really be going full steam by next week. I'm still disappointed that we haven't seen a scene where only Davos and Stannis are present, to me this is the heart of that whole subplot: Davos walking that narrow line between truth and respect. I really would have loved it if Stannis had read the letter back to Davos alone, so Davos could raise his objection to the 'light of the lord' section (providing the real meat of their relationship and revealing his feelings about Mel at the same time).I have no problem with Ros, but I am a little disappointed with the crying scene simply because it portrays Littlefinger as just plain nasty. I wouldn't say book LF is nasty, he's just incredibly driven and ambitious. I can't see book LF sacrificing someone simply to make good on one investment (although he probably would for the prospect of long-term multi investments, or the potential to climb yet higher in the game of thrones).
379	White Raven	2012-04-10	I will never understand why they make such a big deal out of "LIttlefinger owns brothels" in the series and why he has to be around his employees all the time.
But now the things I liked:
Arya/Gendry
Yoren
Tyrion/Varys
Ghost
And I don't really care about the Iron Islands chapters in the books, but I like the portrayal of Balon Greyjoy here.
380	Sam with Hooters	2012-04-10	I love the scene between Vary and Tyrion "And I keep on paddling"Eunuchs, like whores, rarely sink.
381	Nymeria101	2012-04-10	I liked the episode but as everybody else I noticed all the changes...I was surprised when they killed Rhakaro. Really? Why did they change it? I mean, he's important in the books, why would they want to kill him now? And I agree, the Littlefinger-Ros scene was unnecessary. It actually kinda freaked me out. And Mel seducing Stannis? I thought it was a little weird...I just didn't realize they had that kind of a relationship from the books.Also yes, it was kinda dumb to change Asha's name to Yara but if they think we're so stupid to think it's Osha, ok. I have friends who haven't read the books and they're watching the series, and they're really bad at remembering names, so I guess they wanted to make it easier to people who didn't read the books. The brains of us readers have more practice with the whole name-remembering thing.  /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />

I still need more scenes to convince myself 100% that Liam is a good Davos, but I'm optimistic.Grenn, Sam and Dolorous Edd talking about women - priceless.Bad pointsLittlefinger's creepy peep show - completely pointless to me.Stannis and Mel sex scene - it was well done, but it's completely destroying my view of Stannis. I'll wait to see further explanations.

383	bloodymime	2012-04-10	Littlefinger is the guy you want to think can't be all bad because he's witty and has a nice smile. This is the guy that spent his life making Lysa Tully believe he loved her and then when she was no longer useful pushed her out the moon door like another person might step  on a bug. Then to make sure that a girl he grew up with and pretended to love all these years really knew how he felt told her Cat was the only one for him.
Think about that, imagine a person you've grown up with and known for all your life and then imagine murdering that person, no matter  how good of a reason there could be for it, as nonchalantly as Peter killed Lysa. That boy's got a viscious streak that's he had to hide because he's small and he's weak but that doesn't mean it isn't there. Personally he strikes me as a little Mountain That Rides with brains instead of brawn.

All I saw is a black shadow who could've been anyone really, and then I must have blinked because I almost missed the blue eyes. I really don't know how non-readers could have known what that was - I, at least was expecting an Other.Agree that the Ros scene was unneeded to establish Petyr as a villain, and ridiculous to show him as a a whore-wimp : the man is a lord, and wants to become someone important, he's not micro-managing his brothels!My other deception is the Theon-Asha scene : not enough banter, not enough sparks. I'd like to like show "Yara" like I do book's Asha, but so far, I'm not convinced.

Kind of thought of them as Sauron's orcs.

391	chris_warrior	2012-04-10	What he meant by "transform" I don't even want to know. Sounded like some Qyburn shiti actually wondered when i heard this portion of his monologue if it was a (somewhat clunky IMHO) opportunity to introduce Qyburn... in a "remember that throw-away scene in Season 2, Episode @ where we mentioned a man who paid amazing money to cut up living people? well, here he is!" way.i liked the episode, but i also thought the sex scene in the brothel was blatantly gratuitous; i would have preferred more Jon and Sam or Arya. i loved Ghost; i think they did a good job CGI-ing him. i didn't mind the Bronn change or the fact that they're revealing Joffrey as the baby-killer (i actually think it fits well into his ordering a similar deed at Winterfell?). even the bloodrider being killed makes sense if there was an issue with the actor returning. and the Mel and Stannis episode actually made snort/chuckle, given what they did they did on Aerys' table. then, of course, i winced a bit, because they are seriously f*cking the continent of Westeros... literally and figuritively. in that way, i thought it was an effective visual. a littl eham-handed, perhaps, but it got the point across.Theon and the Captain's daughter? eh. Theon and his sister? eh. they're both in the book, and both kind of needed to 'get' the character of Theon, but honestly i really can't stand Theon (and he gets much worse as things go on) so my opinion of "eh" may be more personal than objective.Jacquen? awesome? Sallador? awesome. and obviously Tyrion and the council (including his explicit/added interaction with Varys and his trading jabs with his sister) was wonderful; Peter hits every nuance, and Lena and the guiy who pays Varys are both amazing. it's funny: when i read the King's Landing portions of the books, i rushed through because ICK to most of those characters. now i really want to know where Sansa is, and i want to see more of Tyrion and Cersei. Balish, though, i still want to smother with a pillow.
392	DannySpud	2012-04-10	I forgot Jeyne doesn't show up again 'till DwD, assuming the actress who played her is a similar age to Maisie/Sophie then she'll probably be eighteen by the time they get to that. If she's cool with nude scenes then fine, if not then they can either replace the actress or tone down the scenes. Either way she'll look so different from the last time we saw her that Reek is going to have to make it clear who she is. And she won't be played by Ros (I seriously can't believe this is even a discussion...)

394	CrypticWeirwood	2012-04-10	White Walkers = OthersWights = WightsWhich is itself a problem, because many people would pronounce â<U+0080><U+009C>wight walkersâ<U+0080><U+009D> and â<U+0080><U+009C>white walkersâ<U+0080><U+009D> identically, or even perceive them to be identical even if pronounced distinctly.Canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t you just hear it now?  â<U+0080><U+009C>Hey, are there any blacks in the south to go with the wights in the north?â<U+0080><U+009D>
395	DragonAge93	2012-04-10	Great episode. Nothing really extraordinary happening, but it's the beginning of the season, and the events coming up should be heart pounding.
My favorite scene would have to be Jon Snow and his spying on Craster. May not have been exactly like the book, but it was great and had me with my mouth open. And it was awesome to see the Others/White Walkers again, albeit very briefly.
One thing I didn't totally like was how we go from seeing Theon laying with the captain's daughter, and then the next get an additional two sex scenes right after in Littlefinger's brothel. Usually I don't mind the sex, but these first two episodes have had more sex in them than last year's first two episodes. But whatever.
And can't forget the great scenes we had with Arya and the Night's Watch recruits. And Yoren is such a badass. Too bad we'll probably get his death next episode....
396	chris_warrior	2012-04-10	Ah, and also, say what you will about the Dragonstone scenes, but the visual composition is just brilliant. Fiery Melisandre standing before the Painted Table, behind her only the darkness of the night...That's enough to make me shiver, more than any dialogue.agreed. the visual idea behind that scene made the impact for me. the fact they had sex? meh. at least, as others have said, it explains the shadow son who will kill Renly.
397	Leuf	2012-04-10	Stannis isn't really working for me yet, and I thought they spent a long time with Davos and Saan dancing around Davos' backstory without actually telling it so I'm not sure if that made any sense if you haven't read the books.  But we have a lot of time ahead of us with Stannis and Davos so there's plenty of time to get to know them better.
What I thought was missing from the Theon-Yara/Asha scene was that Asha pretends to be someone else not just to mess with Theon's head but so that he would act like himself in front of her and she could get him to say things he wouldn't have said to her face.  I thought that was important to get across so she doesn't come off like a perv.
This was probably the first Ros scene that I actually liked, if it was just taken out of context standing on its own.  In context, I don't like how they're making LF such an open villain and that scene went on way too long taking away time from other things.
398	Gloria	2012-04-10	So have They confirmed that the Reeds are definitely cut?  Because of all the changes, this is the one that really cheeses me off the most.
	Spoiler I have a feeling they'll cram Bran\Rickon together with Osha and have them both flee with her, and cut out the whole CotF / Bloodraven / Bran / Coldhands plot all together.  Maybe they thought it was too hippie-dippy-magical for the audience to get into, or maybe they're going to focus less on the mystical bits and more on the actual war bits.  Whatever the reason, I don't like it, especially if they cut that whole thing out.  Notice they haven't spent a huge amount of time on the three-eyed crow idea...

400	girlfrommonday	2012-04-10	Which is itself a problem, because many people would pronounce â<U+0080><U+009C>wight walkersâ<U+0080><U+009D> and â<U+0080><U+009C>white walkersâ<U+0080><U+009D> identically, or even perceive them to be identical even if pronounced distinctly.Canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t you just hear it now?  â<U+0080><U+009C>Hey, are there any blacks in the south to go with the wights in the north?â<U+0080><U+009D>I hate this name in GoT - it have sense in books, where the Others are very pale etc. And here with this dark predator look? It makes no sense, because they walk through the snow? oh, hell, the Night's Watch deals with snow also.It's quite funny, I never complain about actors appearance and their similarity to the orginal etc. as far they can act, but when someone changes names I get nervous /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
401	ace	2012-04-10	The Asha/Yara casting wasn't really the way I imagined her. She would probably make a better Brienne. Asha is supposed to be very attractive. Don't want to nitpick on the name change, but doesn't it give you a warm fuzzy feeling to know the producers believe that the fans are too stupid to tell the difference between a and o? And it's a pity the conversation between her and Theon has been so drastically cut/simplified. Was one of the best scenes in the book. If GRRM wrote that scene with her naked you know it would in the episode and it would be at least 5 minutes long.
Loved the Davos/Salladhor scene and Tyrion of course, who is given too little time in the episodes so far. I would probably watch 45 minutes of just Tyrion/Peter Dinklage and enjoy it more than either episode shown so far.
Also that confrontation between Yoren and the mounted gold cloak. Yoren says something like "The throat might be better but cutting off your balls would be pretty bad too".  I smiled at that because in the book he actually has the knife at the gold cloak's throat. But it's also sadly symbolic of the show as a whole with its obsession with between the legs stuff.

402	J_Crews	2012-04-10	While technically true this is not a strong move for a king to do it for his own bastard.  It wrecks havoc in the lines of succession.Again, as someone stated before, Stannis is such an honorable prude TV Mel's flimsy attempts to sway him in such a way at such an early stage in the game would have been met with disgust rather than lust.  Robert was the weak man who fathered bastards.Personally, I would've preferred another path, but I think they're trying to give viewers an explanation for the shadow baby impregnation other than him knowingly participating in dark magics and fratricide.  I always imagined she took his seed, giving him the explanation that the life force within was required by the Lord of Light in order to destroy his enemies, yadayada.  Stannis doesn't strike me as a kinslayer.  He wanted to destroy Renly, but I think he would've preferred to beat his army, then imprison him like with Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine.  Maybe I'm just naive, because I always liked Stannis.  He's a king I'd willingly serve.And, while it's true Aegon IV's legitimizing all his bastards on his deathbed led to the Blackfyre Rebellion, the same wouldn't be true if there was only one bastard and no other heir to contend with.  Henry VIII had a bastard son by a teenage mistress when Catherine of Aragon proved unable to give him a son who lived past infancy, but the boy -- whom Henry was extremely fond of and many believe he intended to name his heir -- died at 17, prior to the law that would've allowed him to be invested as heir made it through Parliament.  Also, in the story, Robb penned such a decree legitimizing Jon and naming him his heir that I'm pretty sure Lady Mormont is carrying as she hides-out at Greywater Watch with Howland Reed.
403	J_Crews	2012-04-10	Stannis doesn't have any sons, so there's no line of succession to disrupt. Exactly.
404	Tewks44	2012-04-10	Overall, I thought it was a good episode.  I was peeved about the Jon Snow scene at the end, but hey, they'll get kicked out of Craster's Keep, the plot will continue as it normally would (book 3 spoilers), 
	Spoiler and when they return Jon won't be with them so that should work out just fine.
  I was also annoyed with the random death of Dany's bloodrider that didn't occur in the book, but he wasn't a major character, and apparently there were conflicting schedules, so there's not much you can do about that.
However, what really got to me was how Yara (Asha) was portrayed.  In the books she was a tease and fended off all of Theon's sexual advances, which culminated in a darkly hilarious "haha, I'm your sister and I just punked you" kind of moment, plus it showed how clever she could be.  In the show she is basically a perv who let her (unknowing) brother get her off on a horse ride....

405	Lord Godric	2012-04-10	I thought that was a great bit too, although it suggests she knows be dies in flames which really doesn't make sense if she sees Stannis' victory. But Mel has always sucked at reading the flames.

406	The Knight of Grasses	2012-04-10	Why do people keep calling the Stannis scene out of character? We all know he sleeps with Melisandre from the heavy, heavy implications in the books. So, what character did he go against? Stannis is a dutiful man bent on justice. He was reluctant to nail Melisandre in the show, but they cant put in 10 scenes of him turning her down before it actually happens. Without seeing that they did it the shadow baby scene becomes a bit confusing. It highlights Mels power over Stannis, which she has in the books.Because the Stannis scene IS out of character.  Just like anyone does out of character things, Stannis sleeping with Mel (both in the books and in the show) is out of character for him.  My point was that in the book, GRRM makes it clear that such a thing is out of character, given that it's never even mentioned explicitly.  We assume it happened, but his character is one of stern adherence to law and justice and all that.In the show, by giving that scene such prominence, it's not very clear that it's out of character for him.  Yeah, he puts up token resistance...for all of like 20 seconds.  I understand the show has to make some sacrifices in order to provide context for later occurrences, but to me it seems like they're sacrificing much of Stannis's character, and that's too high a price.  
	Spoiler I'm no show creator, but I would have preferred that Mel's shadow-spawn would have been some summoned thing that didn't require pregnancy, and the relationship between them could have been developed more slowly and allowed Stannis's uncompromising nature to assert itself before he gives in.

407	LadyStormHeart	2012-04-10	My husband, who has never read the books, also questioned where Ghost was when Jon was whacked by Craster.  I think Ghost will be in the conclusion of the scene next week.
Over all I am very happy with the tv adaptation of the books, though I do wonder how anyone who hasn't read the books can keep up.  There is just SO much going on, so many characters, so many plots... but I know several non-readers who are doing just fine, my husband included, though I have had to clarify things.
I personally am not a purist.  I don't mind the changes they make, as long as they try to keep true to the main theme.  I do have to admit I was a little irritated when they killed Dany's Silver - that horse is still with her and is mentioned in at least every book the Dany has a POV.  I was a little surprised at the blood-rider's death but I don't think it's that big of a deal to the story line.  She has two others, anyway, and more protectors are coming.  I honestly feel the whore scenes were added because hey - it's HBO and sex is kinda their thing - but the mouth wiping scene?  Yeah, could have done without that.  I talked this show up so much to a family member who is very intelligent, well-read and refined, and I can only imagine what he thought when he saw that, hahaha.
All in all, this episode was OK.  I love Tyrion and Cersai - I look forward to their scenes, something I don't remember doing in the books.  I really don't like Stannis, at all.  In the books he was so much more commanding, here he's just a man.  Sam is perfect; he's making me like the character much more than I did in the books.  Asha isn't at all how I imagined, but I'm waiting to see her more in action before coming to any conclusions.  Dany kinda drives me a little nuts... I love her in the book, but her character on the show seems weak still, and when she lashes out or shows her anger it's not at all convincing.
And the Dire wolves are amazing.  Love, love, LOVE.

408	Brewmaster	2012-04-10	About Littlefinger.Doesn't it come out at some point in one of the books that Littlefinger has been supplying some lords with some dead prostitutes, or is that someone else?
409	chris_warrior	2012-04-10	It certainly very hasty, I'll grant you that. But we don't really know what motivates Stannis to sleep with her in the novel, so I suppose the whispered promise of a son might be all it takes. It does make me wonder how they'll deal with it when a son isn't exactly forthcoming -- not the sort of son Stannis imagined he'd get, anyways.the other reason i accept that they decided to show us that scene is that it really makes clear the moment that Stannis ends up "in bed" with R'hllor. so to speak. i always had an odd feeling we had missed the moment of his reluctant "conversion" when i was reading the books. if we take this scene as somewhat canon, it appears clear that he allows Mel free rein not only of his kingdom but of *him* because she promises him victory... and a son.
410	Lord Godric	2012-04-10	I feel like people are making too big of a deal about the Stannis/Melisandre sex scene. Implied or shown, it changes nothing because it happens in both instances.  Some people have said that it make Stannis look like a hypocrite - and well he was. Stannis had a mistress on the sides in the books in the form of  Melisandre while he chastised Robert for being a manwhore and banned brothels on Dragonstone. 
And I actually thought the show did a great job showing that it wasn't Stannis just being horny. When Mel stripped down that didn't make him lust for her, it was after she mentioned being able to produce a son that he acted. We all know that Stannis is an honorable man, and that was not changed by showing him having sex with Melisandre as it wasn't shown as a complete act of lust. 
Also, babies have to be made somehow. And to just show Melisandre giving birth to a shadow baby without ever really explaining wth happened would not make for a clear plot.

In the books outside of a couple of times he is barely mentioned or talks about whores other than as a good investment.
412	Brewmaster	2012-04-10	That's more tv Littlefinger who apparantly lives in a brothel.

There is talk is of how expensive it is to find these corpses and POV character (I think it was Tyrion) is wondering if he found them already as corpses or made them corpses.
413	Ice Turtle	2012-04-10	I hadn't read the whole thread so I don't know if someone mentioned it before but I liked the part when Tyrion read the letter from Mormont and the small council just laughed and left the room. I wonder how many of them will live to rue this.

Some people have said that it make Stannis look like a hypocrite - and well he was. Stannis had a mistress on the sides in the books in the form of  Melisandre while he chastised Robert for being a manwhore and banned brothels on Dragonstone.Book Stannis never had a mistress. He had an ally/servant/guide in Melisandre but nowhere is a sexual relationship said or even implied.And I actually thought the show did a great job showing that it wasn't Stannis just being horny. When Mel stripped down that didn't make him lust for her, it was after she mentioned being able to produce a son that he acted. We all know that Stannis is an honorable man, and that was not changed by showing him having sex with Melisandre as it wasn't shown as a complete act of lust.Book Stannis is portrayed as someone completely not interested in sex beyond producing an heir. Melisandre wouldn't even try to seduce him. Not only that, he's also married which means he has a duty and an obligation to his wife. And you know how he feels about duty. So he's not only not someone who would be interested in sex for sex's sake or desire it, so wouldn't be seduced easily, he's someone for whom duty, honor, his vows and obligations are above any personal desires he might have.And that 20 second feigning resistance to her. It wouldn't even be believable as playing hard to get.Also, babies have to be made somehow. And to just show Melisandre giving birth to a shadow baby without ever really explaining wth happened would not make for a clear plot.Exactly. Babies are made this way. But Mel never had any babies. The shadows are some sort of dark magic. It's never said that they require an actual sexual intercourse to create, much less with Stannis. In fact IIRC it's implied that Stannis doesn't even know that Mel is behind these assassinations, only that she sees them in the flames and then they happen.And now that Mel seduces him with the promise of a son, what happens? Is she lying or misleading him? That would also be completely against her character. Or is she actually going to give birth to a son and they'll be a happy family. That would be even worse.PS I finished reading ASOS so perhaps there is something in the next books I don't yet know but the show is still in the beginning of ACOK and so far this particular arc is straying far from the book.
416	Isabella Stark	2012-04-10	I really enjoyed this episode.
I won't list everything I liked, because most of it has already been discussed.
I liked the dialogue.  There were a lot of memorable lines in this episode.
I can't believe the Krakon fireplace hasn't received more discussion.  I had about 10 people with me watching (both readers and non-readers), and everyone went "ooh wow" when we saw that.  Congrats to the set designers.
Lommy's green hands were another nice touch. I didn't notice Dragonstone being dragon shaped, so I'll have to go back and take another look.
Re.: Asha
1) I can't believe there's this much discussion over the name change. It's not like it changes the plot or anything.  I think the concern about confusion is justified.  Apparently lots of non-readers couldn't tell Robb, Theon and Jon apart.  Yes, the Asha/Osha issue is a different issue since they never appear in a scene together, but noobs have enough new info to absorb without having to deal with, "what's her name? Asha? Isn't Tonks playing someone called Asha?" etc. I wouldn't be surprised if the producers were emplying some non-reader to review the scripts to catch potential confusion for non-reader viewers, and that person got confused between Asha and Osha. I don't think it's the end of the world if hbo overcompensates to avoid confusion.
2) But yes, "Yara" sounds dumb and resembles Arya.  Couldn't they have gone with "Marina" or something completely different?
3) The actress wasn't what I pictured, but I was picturing Lily Allen, and I'm glad they didn't go that route!  She really looked like Balon Greyjoy.  I liked that!
I too am getting irritated, not by the sex or by Ros, but by how much time Littlefinger seems to spend at the brothel when he's surely got more important things to be dealing with, being Master of Coin and all.

It's never said that they require an actual sexual intercourse to create, much less with Stannis.Sorry, you're wrong here. It's spelled out more than once that they had sex to produce the shadow babies. At some point, Mel tries to get Davos in her bed instead because she says this magic "drains" Stannis's energy too much. And we know from Mel's POV that Stannis has "shared her bed".
418	EgoistMusketeer	2012-04-10	Does anyone know if episode 2x03 will come out early on GO like last week's did?
419	DannySpud	2012-04-10	One thing I hope they include soon is Tyrion's one... two... three... sequence when he's basically fixing KL.
420	hesitantreader	2012-04-10	Yeah, I felt her only real importance in the books is to introduce us to greyscale, but that's not really important till FfC/DwD (I forget which one...) and can be done by pretty much anyone. Sure there's the technicality of her getting the Iron Throne but does anyone really think that'll happen?I think she said "No sons, only stillborns" which could be referring to he's had a daughter, but only stillborn sons, or it could be that he has no children. Can't really tell.She seems important, but in part because of how long she has been around in the books.  I could go on with speculation about what role she will play, but it seems shortsighted to cut her out of the story unless Martin has given them inside information.
421	J_Crews	2012-04-10	Book Stannis never had a mistress. He had an ally/servant/guide in Melisandre but nowhere is a sexual relationship said or even implied.It's not only *HEAVILY* implied, if you read between the lines, as far back as ACoK, but pretty much outright stated as fact later.  Keep reading.  There are numerous quotes from the books in this very thread to prove it if you back-track, for that matter.  We don't get POVs for either of them in the early stages (and still none, to this day, for Stannis), so you have to read between the lines like with Renly and Loras's rampant man-love, which GRRM has confirmed he intended all along. Exactly. Babies are made this way. But Mel never had any babies. The shadows are some sort of dark magic. It's never said that they require an actual sexual intercourse to create, much less with Stannis...She didn't wave a wand and conjure the shadow.  She stood, throwing-off her robes to reveal a huge preggerz belly, then squatted and "birthed" the shadow baby right in front of a confused, terrified, and sickened Davos, who recognized it as looking like Stannis.  It doesn't get much more implied than that.
422	Vikingkingq	2012-04-10	Because the Stannis scene IS out of character.  Just like anyone does out of character things, Stannis sleeping with Mel (both in the books and in the show) is out of character for him.

 It is absolutely mentioned explicitly, and it is therefore in character given that it happened. Stannis slept with Melisandre, he did it before the meeting at Storm's End, she gave birth to a shadowbaby.Stannis' character is about his adherence to law and justice - not to honor. He's not Ned Stark, he's incredibly pragmatic and ruthless about the means to his ends. He's willing to forgive people he considers to be traitors to get their bannermen, he's willing to use R'hllor/blood magic to kill off the pretenders to his throne (I'm not referring to Renly here, FYI) even if that possibly means the death of Edric Storm, his own kin.What makes Stannis Stannis is that he is a man poised on the absolute edge of heroism and villainy, whether he allows his resentment and sense of entitlement to push him into becoming the new Night's King or whether he listens to his better angels in the form of Davos and decides to stake his claim by defending the realm.And I'm sorry, ace, but it's quite explicit that he's sleeping with Melisandre. She shared his tent during the campaign, Melisandre herself confirms that she slept with him to produce the shadowbabies (which Davos recognizes as Stannis' shadows) and "wore him out" so to speak when we get her viewpoint chapters later on.He doesn't do so to get a son. If you rewatch the scene, it's very clear - Stannis says he can't win without Renly's army, Melisandre says she's seen a path to victory in the flames but that he has to give all of himself to the Lord of Light, Stannis thinks she's talking about the words, she makes it clear she's talking about sex, only then does she bring up the sons issue to get him over the issue of cheating on his wife.
423	Leuf	2012-04-10	So have They confirmed that the Reeds are definitely cut?  Because of all the changes, this is the one that really cheeses me off the most.From the interview with D&D: "there are certain elements from the third book that are going into the second season, and certain elements from the second book going into the third season."I don't see why Bran and whoever he is with couldn't encounter the Reeds later and pick up on that next season, if they wanted to go that way.
424	hesitantreader	2012-04-10	The one thing that I wish they had left in from the book was Tyrion getting Slynt to reveal his most trusted men and then sending them off with him to the wall.  I think it serves to illustrate the power base that Slynt brings to the wall with him, important to the future story, and it also makes Tyrion seem more clever.  Considering how few lines they would of added to the sequence it seems like an odd cut.

425	Brewmaster	2012-04-10	I don't see the extra men as being at all crucial to the later Wall plots. Slynt and Thorne set up against Jon and a lot of the older wall vets are simply against Jon because he's young at first and later because of his Wildling connection and the ways he's changing the Watch. In fact, I don't ever remember the extra men from King's Landing being mentioned once they got to the wall at all.

The direwolves look great. Real or not (I think they're real...?), they LOOK real
A little disappointed in the fact that Mel and Stannis are all of a sudden in a sexual relationship....what's the point in this, besides making the series even more racy...
Disappointed in the very limited Daenerys screen-time over the past two episodes
Why is Asha "Yara" now? Grrrrrrr
Otherwise, I loved the episode, especially the Cersei/Tyrion banter..

Considering how few lines they would of added to the sequence it seems like an odd cut.yes. and i kind of missed how he implied "Oh, and this particular one should encounter rough seas and accidentally drown." i think it pointed out that the character of Tyrion was somewhat honorable... but not above killing off people he thought deserved it.
429	J_Crews	2012-04-10	A little disappointed in the fact that Mel and Stannis are all of a sudden in a sexual relationship....what's the point in this, besides making the series even more racy...As has been proven already earlier in this thread, they scromped in the books too.  People just seem to've missed it somehow.Disappointed in the very limited Daenerys screen-time over the past two episodesShe does very little in the 2nd book.  What?  Like 7 total POV chapters, maybe, in the whole book?Why is Asha "Yara" now? GrrrrrrrBecause there's already another character named Osha, and a large percentage of the population of the planet are morons.  The producers were worried they might get confused.  And they were probably right.  If most people weren't morons, Reality TV wouldn't exist.

430	DarkWingsDarkWords	2012-04-10	Well Martin hinted towards Stannis and Melissandre having sex in the book, as vague as it was. Naturally when I saw it wasn't surprised. Though the actor for Stannis in my opinion doesn't fit the bill due to the fact Martin always mentions his defined jaw and the constant grinding of the teeth, he doesnt seem like an uptight man with Robert envy. Why doesn't the show ever show Davos playing with his finger pouch, that's a major part of his character. Plus Arya revealing herself made more sense in the book then it does in the show. Being to eager to trust isn't part of her character. I don't think they will have Shireen in the show because when Stannis and Melisandre are about to have sex she mentions to Stannis that Selyse gave him a stillborn. Unfortunate too for Davos he only has one son now and he's the one that's going to die in the " green fire."  Last but not least Rakharo dieing was a shame, isn't he the one that leads them to the deserted village where they get respite from the desert elements
431	CrypticWeirwood	2012-04-10	Unfortunate too for Davos he only has one son now and he's the one that's going to die in the "green fire." Just because weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve only seen Matthos doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t mean that Devan et alios cannot exist.
432	Ikurai	2012-04-10	To all those people who don't like changes to the story and want things to go word-for-word as the book: Stop watching this and just read the books again. I promise you they will not disappoint you. /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />  However, it'd make things quite boring for me.
Having gotten that out of my chest, I will do some episode thrashing myself... WHY IS THE STORY MOVING SO FAST??? Is  this season going to cover everything that happens in all the books and the finale will be John getting Ceaser'd? (don't answer that)
I read the books after watching season 1 - which was fabulous. But are people that haven't read the book getting the story? If I didn't know what was going on, my head might hurt.
Secondly, this episode needed to get a move on! I understand that new characters being introduced puts a strain on the story but by that logic the entire season will be like this as Martin keeps introducing new characters. I certainly hope it isn't.
Now on to those controversial topics, I dislike disagreeing just to be in the minority but I am going to stick my neck out again and say I liked the LF scene. Many people disliked the Ros/LF scene because it was.... "not in the books"/"not extremely important"/both. I suspect, however, a lot of people didn't like how LF was being portrayed even though they may not have spelt it out - it may have clashed with their mental image of LF. This is quite understandable after reading LF's plans in the later books as it shrouds him with mystery and shows his conniving nature. However, there is no denying the facts that he IS brutal and he DID run a brothel and most probably he WOULD have to face a similar situation in the virtual world that Martin created. And I can't say he would have reacted very differently. So to those who dislike it because it wasn't in the book, look back to the first line of this post. Atleast, it wasn't particularly uncharacteristic like the scene from last episode which is debatable.
To those who feel that there was ono point to the scene and it was just fabricating new stuff just for the hell of it - I strongly disagree. Until now(the story so far), LF has been viewed as a minor/side role. Even if he IS a conniving side role. In fact, until Sansa was saved by him, LF wasn't given that much importance. He was always a man to watch out for but not quite a wild card yet. However, that drastically changes, and he has parts to play later. I think the directors are giving us face time with him to help him make the transition from a side role (who gets screen time only when he is making a proposal to Ned or trading words with Varys) to a main role who gets screen time by his own right. That's just how I choose to view it.
Also about how the episode ended - having read the books, it's not much of a cliff-hanger as we  know nothing will come off it - but I guess if I hadn't read them, it might have been very interesting.

I love me some Onion Knight!  If I hadn't read the books, however, I don't think I'd be understanding him right now.  He better get a damn monologue to tell his story or something.  Ooh.  Ooh.  When he's rowing Mel into the cove under Storm's End.  That's a good opportunity for some exposition right thurr.  I don't think they will have Shireen in the show because when Stannis and Melisandre are about to have sex she mentions to Stannis that Selyse gave him a stillborn.She actually says,  "No sons.  Only Stillborns.  Only death."  They can still squeak in a daughter, if they want to.  The in-episode dialogue allows wiggle-room.

434	Jack's Smirking Revenge	2012-04-11	First time I've been able to get on the boards since Sunday.  Here are my observations:
1. The Arya parts were the best part of the episode.  The dynamic between her and Gendry plus Lommy and Hot Pie really works.  Tom seems like he's going to be awesome as Jaquen.
2.  Pyke looks pretty awesome.  I wasn't very excited when I saw Balon but he was awesome.  Alfie is pretty great as Theon. As for Asha er excuse me "Yara"....eh.  She doesn't exactly have the charisma of Asha but it was only the first episode.  Also it was awesome they added Pyke to the opening credits.
3.  I'm not that big of a fan of Lena Headly. 
4.  Peter Dinklage continues to kill it.  Still not a fan of Shea. 
5.  Dany is boring.  Of course I thought that throughout the books.
6.  The scene between Stannis and Mellisandre was awkward.  Just the way it was executed it seemed....awkward.  I thought Stannis was sleeping with her in the books so that didn't bother me but it was just weird.
7.  Davos is awesome but they didn't need to make him an Athiest.  He was a believer in the Seven in the book.  I guess it was an attempt to show his devotion to Stannis...It works for Jaime but not him IMO. 
8.  Ros....oh Ros.  At least that scene with Littlefinger actually proved a point but Ros is awful.  Please stop wasting time on her.
9.  Cliff hanger was lame.  Showing Jon seeing the White Walkers was fine but Craster knocking him out was silly IMO.
10. Ghost looked great!
I felt like the pacing and some of the scenes were pretty disjointed this episode.  I didn't like it as much as the first episode but the addition of Arya made it pretty great.  I'm hoping next week is better though, the lack of Robb and his storyline or Bran kind of hurt it.
435	Odie Wan Kenodie	2012-04-11	5.  Dany is boring.  Of course I thought that throughout the books.She is terribly boring. Not to mention I'm sick of seeing her staring dreamily into the distance with empty eyes.She's really just wank material for those who do not get turned on by Ros. Wank material with three dragons.
436	pinkie10	2012-04-11	Correct me if I'm wrong but Gilly didn't have the child while the Night's Watch was there in ACOK. She had it in the next book and it wasn't sacrificed because Craster dies. Right? Right. This baby has a bit of importance later on.. I think. Craster just giving it away in the TV show could pose a problem. No? Butterfly Effect.
437	girlfrommonday	2012-04-11	Correct me if I'm wrong but Gilly didn't have the child while the Night's Watch was there in ACOK. She had it in the next book and it wasn't sacrificed because Craster dies. Right? Right. This baby has a bit of importance later on.. I think. Craster just giving it away in the TV show could pose a problem. No? Butterfly Effect.it is probably the child of some other wife.
438	malek	2012-04-11	Ever since series were first anounced I hoped they will put in just that one little exchange between Tyrion and Bronn that I find best in the series. And was soooo glad when I've seen it in this episode, though Flynn could have delivered it bit better (at least while rubbing his fingers together).
I've read some posts from those that haven't read the books about how Bronn is a golden hearted sellsword, and there is some on Ned Stark in him ?! Hope that this exchange oppened eyes of these.
439	night light	2012-04-11	I loved almost everything about this episode: Tyrion and Bronn, Yoren, Arya and Gendry, Davos and Sallador, everything and everyone at Pyke, Dolorous Edd, Sam, Gilly and Jon beyond the Wall - all fabulous. I personally didn't have a problem with the Stannis/Mel sex scene, as it was heavily implied in the books and will certainly make the whole "shadowbaby" thing clearer to non-readers. Similarly, I didn't mind the change with Jon seeing Craster making his offering to the Others: it explained in a few seconds what would otherwise have taken a couple of minutes of dialogue to describe. I can't see how it would cause a huge ongoing deviation from the books - I assumed Craster struck Jon mostly so he can drag him back and take him for a wife out of anger, not necessarily to keep his sacrifice a secret. Mormont already knows what's happening (or at least book Mormont does), and Craster's rage just means the brothers will be moving on from Craster's Keep a bit earlier. Which is good, yes? For pacing purposes. There's a lot of book to get through.Which brings me to my main complaint: the added brothel scenes. Quite aside from the fact that the bj/peepshow and the subsequent action was vile (I'm no prude, but I really, really thought it was unnecessarily exploitative and offensive), I just don't see why they're wasting TIME on this shit. One book, ten episodes and so many brilliant characters, and HBO fritters away precious screentime on this crap? Really? For the record, I don't buy the characterization angle either: I honestly don't think it added anything to the story, or shed any new light on Littlefinger. We already know he's an untrustworthy, morally bankrupt opportunist. Now we know what...he likes to watch? He likes to clean up afterwards? Ugh.
440	Tywin's bastard	2012-04-11	Ever since series were first anounced I hoped they will put in just that one little exchange between Tyrion and Bronn that I find best in the series. And was soooo glad when I've seen it in this episode, though Flynn could have delivered it bit better (at least while rubbing his fingers together).I have the opposite opinion. Rubbing his fingers together and so on would have made it slightly cheesier and less natural for me. The way Flynn did it seemed very genuine to me.Which brings me to my main complaint: the added brothel scenes. Quite aside from the fact that the bj/peepshow and the subsequent action was vile (I'm no prude, but I really, really thought it was unnecessarily exploitative and offensive), I just don't see why they're wasting TIME on this shit.

We already know he's an untrustworthy, morally bankrupt opportunist. Now we know what...he likes to watch? He likes to clean up afterwards? Ugh.Nothing about his actions indicated that he watched because he liked it. He had a completely neutral look when he was watching so it was obviously just him keeping a close eye on his business (information is power). That you assume that he likes to clean up is even more strange since that part is just meant to gross people out.And we do get to see a different depth to the limits Littlefinger will go to in order to profit from it. If you don't think that's anything new I suppose we don't need have to have Joffrey do anything sadistic anymore since he already did that in the first season and we couldn't possibly gain anything from continuing to follow his character on that path, right?

441	Ser Dermett Corbray	2012-04-11	Made a thread about this but it seems it wasn't approved... what did people make of Bronn being made City Watch commander? I always thought it was good that Tyrion removed Slynt and replaced him with a veteran in Ironhand. I suppose Bywater wasn't exactly a major character but it showed that Tyrion saw the importance of raising those that deserve it. Would the goldcloaks accept Bronn as their leader? Also, Tyrion was pretty just and professional in his decisions during his time as Hand (even if the people didn't see that). It seems weird that he'd relieve one of Cersei's lickspittles of his duty then raise a questionable mercenary to such an important rank. Promoting Ironhand was a great move because he gained a key follower and he was also a veteran goldcloak and would command the respect of his men.
Just a minor thing but it bugged me.
442	legba11	2012-04-11	There are way too many characters already in the books (for television) and Bronn has little to do this season other than Episode 9.  This is a very sensible reduction.
443	Ser Dermett Corbray	2012-04-11	Yeah but what more will he do now as commander of the city watch? Wear gold armour instead of black? It was his gradual rise from mercenary to Tyrion's captain of guards (recruiting other mercenaries within the city, including the Kettleblacks) to knight post-Blackwater (being made a knight after serving as commander of the gold cloaks and being replaced my Addam Marbrand is a bit silly, unless Tywin keeps Bronn on as commander in the tv show) to minor lord was what made Bronn unique.
Thinking about it, I guess it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine Tywin keeping Bronn on as commander when he comes to town at the end of the season. I guess this means no Addam Marbrand either.
444	BronnFan	2012-04-11	Thinking about it, I guess it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine Tywin keeping Bronn on as commander when he comes to town at the end of the season. I guess this means no Addam Marbrand either.Perhaps he replaces Bronn as City Watch Commander but has him marry Lollys to placate him.
445	Ran	2012-04-11	You do have to suspend disbelief a little bit, re: Bronn as City Watch commander. But I don't expect he'll be holding on to the post after this season -- Tywin will almost certainly shoo him out of it.

446	Rhaegar Stark	2012-04-11	I have read a lot of posts about how Dillane isn't carrying it as Stannis. I disagree. I especially liked the moment when he asked Melissandre what she whispered to Matthos. His stare is pretty spot on with what I viewed as Stannis. Also remember he really has not gotten much screen time I think they will put more emphasis on him and Davos when he meets up with Renly all the way to Blackwater. That is my guess at any rate. Dillane is a fantastic actor all I am saying is give him a chance.
447	Chuckcash	2012-04-11	Hi All - First Post!Now that I can get on, here we go... /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />The posts on here are pretty represantive of my feelings anyway on the changes - some good, some bad, however, essentaily massively lost opportunities to further cement the series and new characters for me.Theon and Asha's exchange was one of the funniest parts in the books so far and should have been been acted verbatim IMO. Asha letting theon go only so far before taking control again, verbally and physically, kept the scene on track and Ironic - the TV scene was plain seedy and I do not see how any none Book reader will grow to appreciate Asha/yara/whateverStannis......On whether Stannis had sex with Mel in the books:A Storm of Swords U.S. paperback pg. 347"Is the brave Ser Onions so frightened of a passing shadow? Take heart, then. Shadows only live when given birth by light, and the king's fires burn so low I dare not draw off anymore to make another son. It might well  kill him." Melissandre moved closer, " With another man, though...a man whose flames still burn hot and high...if you truly wish to serve your king's cause, come to my chamber one night. I could give you pleasure such as you have never known, and with your life-fire I could make..."Thanks! That's exactly what I have been looking for to substantiate the relatinship between Stannis and Mel as i could not place it in the books, or on the forum. My first reaction was "Nooooo!!" and actually still is, but for a different reason now. The above passage is from what I expect will be part of the next season and is from the 3rd book and not at this point. At Renly's murder, we just know that Mel is involved but not how she did it. At this point (Book2), my thoughts of the "Shadow Baby" was just one of magic and Mel's Power (Mel seduces/rapes Stannis while he is asleep?). Stannis admits to Davos that he has trouble sleeping; dreams of being in renly's tent and his Bloody peach etc. if we have to keep the table scene, why was it needed now? The shock of renly's murder will now be completely lost to everyone when it happens and could easily be covered (by the table scene) in the following episode? For me, an ideal oportunity to spice up the Magic aspect has been lost.I concede that Stannis' character is open to question as he is not a POV character, however, Davos is not the only source of character witness that we get for Stannis, with all forming the same summary: Stannis is Iron, brittle, never bends and is above all dutiful - Davos finger bones are the perfect summary of who Stannis is - ultimatley unforgiving (I also feel unimaginative but thats a personal take) which is his ultimate character flaw (and easily malleable by Mel)It's a big Reach, but, I always considered that Stannis would "find out" that Mel is using him and react to this - casting her adrift in a future book in a big way. Currently, he seems more consenting Pawn than the current King to be, Pre Blackwater. Post Blackwater, now, thats another thing... /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

451	jon's_mom	2012-04-11	it sucked. What is up with that crap? I know some stuff has to change coz actors move on or whatever but Joon playing scooby doo woods detective? oh come on, not only that but they make it a cliff hangar that Jon gets knocked out playing detective? total bullshit

If they show her pregnant then I would agree with you.
453	jon's_mom	2012-04-11	next episode.....
Craster is about to kill Jon but then stops because Ghost growls and threatens him..... like yeah, Ghost would never let Jon get hit on the head in the first place but whatever. Pretty annoyed about this crap being played around with. GRRM obviously doesn't care about the others in 4 subsequent books, whyt we have to put up with it here all of a sudden

If they show her pregnant then I would agree with you..Judging from the trailers we will most definitely see Mel give birth to the shadowbaby. And if I'm remembering correctly from the book, Davos remarked that she looked as if she was to deliver any moment, at that time.
456	Fist of the First Men	2012-04-11	The Craster ending I'm sure just adds a cliffhanger for the non-readers. I think it will signal they've warn out their welcome and the watch will move on toward the Fist.
457	ace	2012-04-11	Well, that quote from ASOS might imply they had sex. Or it might not. Sex usually doesn't kill people, even tired or depressed people. That's the beauty of mystery. Not everything must be dumbed down to a yes/no question. That's what made the books great. 
But I think the argument whether it's true to the books or not kinda misses the real point. That scene wasn't put in the episode for its value to the story. It wasn't in the books so no one can honestly say it is vital or even important to the story. From the story point of view it would've been better/more shocking to keep the shadows a mystery the way it's in the books. The real reason for that scene was HBO's "boob quota". 
Same with the endless brothel scenes. It's obvious the brothels/Ros aren't put there for LF or anything plot related. LF is put there for the brothels. It's the same "lowest common denominator" attitude by the producers that leads to the excessive amount of sex scenes at the cost of important plot elements. The Tullys are cut, the Reeds are cut, Catelyn is cut, all the other character arcs are cut to the bone and a bit more. Anyone who read the books can give you a list of things he wanted to see but won't. But no one can ever say the show doesn't have enough sex scenes.
I think that by endlessly arguing whether a certain sex scene is canon or how to fit it to the books we're excusing the producers attitude to the story. I prefer to see more of the story at the expense of gratuitous sex scenes than more sex scenes at the expense of the story.

Next morning Jon wakes up in the woods with a headache, talks to Mormont about seeing the white Walker but keeps mum about Craster.  And the plot continues past the diversion same as in the book.
459	Leuf	2012-04-11	.Judging from the trailers we will most definitely see Mel give birth to the shadowbaby. And if I'm remembering correctly from the book, Davos remarked that she looked as if she was to deliver any moment, at that time.But in the books there are two shadow babies, one for Renly and one for Storm's End.  The first is out of the blue, we even see Mel from Cat's perspective just before and there's no mention of her looking pregnant, the second we get much more from Davos' perspective.
460	Knight of Ashes	2012-04-11	Every time I see Arya on season 2, I can't help but think "Wow. Yoren would make a good hairstylist."
461	legba11	2012-04-11	A couple of people have said it now, Ghost is out hunting frequently.  I would imagine more so at night.  It's likely he makes the save to begin 2.03, however.
462	Brewmaster	2012-04-11	Well, that quote from ASOS might imply they had sex. Or it might not. Sex usually doesn't kill people, even tired or depressed people. That's the beauty of mystery.

The Shadowbaby quote isn't the only spot, there are multiple points in the books that tell the story of Stannis fucking Mel. And, he flat out admits it to Davos.
463	tearloch	2012-04-11	I am in the camp that had no problem at all with Stannis and Mel getting it on.  I think it was heavily implied in many places in the books. 
I am trying to recall the timeline.  Stannis should be meeting/killing Renly in the next episode?  That will probably be the ending of episode 3.  But when does Stannis take Stormsend?  Is it right after he kills off Renly?  If so, maybe they needed a little bit of time in between Stannis' encounters with Mel, since it drains him so much....  I do hope HBO makes it very apparent that the shadow babies look like Stannis.  I seem to recall Catlyn remembering that what she saw kill Renly had "Stannis' shadow".....
I also remember thinking in ADWD during Mel's POV chapters, when she is talking about glamors and such, that she needs things from people to work her magic, whether its bones from armor, or the "seed" of her king.  I think that was the final nail in the coffin for me to confirm what she had done to make the shadow babies in previous books.
464	J_Crews	2012-04-11	Above any other, her telling Davos in plain English that she's used Stannis up too much and, if he really wants to help, he should come to her chambers one night and trade his life-fire for pleasure is beyond a hint.  How anyone can read that and not see it is beyond me.  And that's just one quote among several.  Didn't Mel even comment in her POV in ADwD that her bed was seeing much use since Stannis had been away?
465	DanyStark	2012-04-11	Can I just say that one of my favorite parts of the show is the opening I jumped for joy when I saw Pyke in the opening credits. It is a brilliant sequence and I am trying my damnest to spread the word to non-book readers that you shkould not just fast forward as many of them have told me they do! For shame! So help me fellow GoT lovers to tell people to watch the beautiful beginnings!

Dillane is a fantastic actor all I am saying is give him a chance.I'm willing to give him a chance, but I've been disappointed so far.  He does not communicate strength and power, only inflexibility and weakness.  Book-Stannis is the most formidable commander in the 7 kingdoms.  So far I have not seen this side of him.   Is this because of the actor or the script?I am not one to complain about script departures from the book.  I think they not only are inevitable but desirable, especially for these books.  I'm willing to give the writers a lot of slack.  But I hope that Stannis gets better.

467	Vikingkingq	2012-04-11	Well, that quote from ASOS might imply they had sex. Or it might not. Sex usually doesn't kill people, even tired or depressed people. That's the beauty of mystery. Not everything must be dumbed down to a yes/no question. That's what made the books great.But I think the argument whether it's true to the books or not kinda misses the real point. That scene wasn't put in the episode for its value to the story. It wasn't in the books so no one can honestly say it is vital or even important to the story. From the story point of view it would've been better/more shocking to keep the shadows a mystery the way it's in the books. The real reason for that scene was HBO's "boob quota".I'm sorry, but you're just assuming bad faith of the showrunners here. This scene is here because it happened in the book, we just didn't get to see it due to lack of POV, anymore than we got to see Robb interact with Jaime or Cersei with Joffrey. And yes, it's vital - because the audience needs to understand what's going to happen at the end of episode 4.If Melisandre simply showed up looking pregnant and gave birth to a shadowbaby out of nowhere, the audience wouldn't understand it, and wouldn't invest anything in that moment. Instead, they're being handed a huge headfake - they think Melisandre is going to have Stannis' baby and then we're going to see a shocking inversion of nature that is going to stun people, not just because it's one of the few scenes of blatant magic we've seen yet but also because it's going to confound their expectations about what was going on with Stannis and Melisandre and the pregnancy.
468	Vikingkingq	2012-04-11	I am trying to recall the timeline.  Stannis should be meeting/killing Renly in the next episode?  That will probably be the ending of episode 3.  But when does Stannis take Stormsend?  Is it right after he kills off Renly?  If so, maybe they needed a little bit of time in between Stannis' encounters with Mel, since it drains him so much....  I do hope HBO makes it very apparent that the shadow babies look like Stannis.  I seem to recall Catlyn remembering that what she saw kill Renly had "Stannis' shadow".....Episode 3 is Catelyn discussing peace terms with Renly when he gets the news about the siege of Storms End, then Stannis meets Renly in episode 4, and episode 5 suggests that the shadowbaby will be the capper to episode 4.I think they're going to blend the second shadowbaby in with the first and have Davos row Melisandre over as she gives birth to the one that kills Renly.
469	Humphrey Plantagenet	2012-04-11	Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not worried about Stannis/Mel knocking boots being explicit rather than implicitâ<U+0080>¦itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s TV after all. But Mel promising to give him a male heir doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t work for me. It changes her character and motivation.
470	legba11	2012-04-11	They aren't likely going to worry about the second shadow baby, I imagine Renly will be killed in Storm's End.  It's an easy way to cut an unimportant plot point and simplify things.
471	Morrigan	2012-04-11	Well, that quote from ASOS might imply they had sex. Or it might not. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' /> Seriously? How can people be this dense? Let us post the quote again, with some highlights:â<U+0080><U+009C>Is the brave Ser Onions so frightened of a passing shadow? Take heart, then. Shadows only live when given birth by light, and the kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s fires burn so low I dare not draw off any more to make another son. It might well kill him.â<U+0080><U+009D> Melisandre moved closer. â<U+0080><U+009C>With another man, though ... a man whose flames still burn hot and high ... if you truly wish to serve your kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s cause, come to my chamber one night. I could give you pleasure such as you have never known, and with your life-fire I could make...â<U+0080><U+009D>â<U+0080><U+009C>. . . a horror.â<U+0080><U+009D> Davos retreated from her. â<U+0080><U+009C>I want no part of you, my lady. Or your god. May the Seven protect me.â<U+0080><U+009D>You have to be deliberately obtuse to not realize she's talking about sex. Come on now.Above any other, her telling Davos in plain English that she's used Stannis up too much and, if he really wants to help, he should come to her chambers one night and trade his life-fire for pleasure is beyond a hint.  How anyone can read that and not see it is beyond me.  And that's just one quote among several.  Didn't Mel even comment in her POV in ADwD that her bed was seeing much use since Stannis had been away?Yup:Melisandre had spent the night in her chair by the fire, as she often did. With Stannis gone, her bed saw little use. She had no time for sleep, with the weight of the world upon her shoulders.And just in case some people want to be deliberately obtuse again and say she used the bed for sleeping, no, she doesn't use beds for sleeping. The passage above follows up with,And she feared to dream. Sleep is a little death, dreams the whisperings of the Other, who would drag us all into his eternal night. She would sooner sit bathed in the ruddy glow of her red lordâ<U+0080><U+0099>s blessed flames, her cheeks flushed by the wash of heat as if by a loverâ<U+0080><U+0099>s kisses. Some nights she drowsed, but never for more than an hour.So she doesn't use her bed much anymore, because she doesn't need to sleep much, nor does she want to. When Stannis was there, she did use the bed. Geez, I wonder what she used it for. /rolleyes.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' />I do agree that some of the sex scenes are gratuitous and stupid. Particularly the additional brothel ones. And it could be argued that showing Mel/Stannis having it on on-screen instead of off-screen wasn't the right decision or that the placement of that scene was too soon or whatever (personally I think it's fine by itself, but a bit too early in the season, especially in an episode with a large number of porn scenes already haha). But to bitch that it's not canon or not from the books is just hilarious.

474	Chuckcash	2012-04-11	It's quite a leap to go from Mel and Stannis have sex to the invisible assassin was actually given birth by her, if we don't actually see her being pregnant first.  If they show her pregnant then I would agree with you.Not sure what you're getting at there - if they had saved the Table scene until after Renly's murder, there would be no leap to make at that point; shock at his murder would be everything. Shocked understanding would then come after the Table scene, before Davos rows her out to Stormsend with the Audience now knowing what to expect. I might be wrong in hindsight after the season ends and it all may tie up brilliantly, but right now, it just feels cackhanded at this point! /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
475	Vikingkingq	2012-04-11	Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not worried about Stannis/Mel knocking boots being explicit rather than implicitâ<U+0080>¦itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s TV after all. But Mel promising to give him a male heir doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t work for me. It changes her character and motivation. I don't think it does. As I've said, she only brings up the child when Stannis brings up his wife - the child reference is tactical, not motivational. The motivation is clear - Stannis needs to give all of himself to the Lord of Light to achieve victory.
476	Leuf	2012-04-11	Not sure what you're getting at there - if they had saved the Table scene until after Renly's murder, there would be no leap to make at that point; shock at his murder would be everything. Shocked understanding would then come after the Table scene, before Davos rows her out to Stormsend with the Audience now knowing what to expect.No it wouldn't, because the idea that the shadow was something she had to actually give birth to rather than just conjure up is not a logical conclusion from just seeing them have sex.  But if we see her pregnant before the first (or only?) shadow over a time period, when she couldn't possibly be showing a normal pregnancy, then you immediately know something is up, especially when Dany never showed her pregnancy.
477	EgoistMusketeer	2012-04-11	Does anyone else think that although the Stannis actor is doing a good job, when he says
    "I cannot defeat my brother in the field"
its one of the worst delivered lines in the series.

479	TheColdWinds	2012-04-11	They are changing alot. I like the changing with the indivdual scenes while keeping the esscense of the story still there. However they seem to be cutting corners and taking out alot of characters. Shireen, Bywater, and they killed Rakharo!! I also believe the way the show is going that they are going to cut Edric Storm aswell. Not cool. They seem to be just cutting down the story alot in a attempt to pop off new seasons. I would have wished they spent more time getting stronger acotrs for ahsa/yara, and gilly, and spending more time on the story. THEY ARE CUTTING TO MUCH OUT WTF!!!! PATCHFACE!!!! NO!!!
480	Jaxom 1974	2012-04-11	It's clear Stannis has slept with Melisandre in the novels -- the shadow she gives birth to is his shadow! -- but it's quite subtle.I really would have preferred some more ambiguity about the whole thing on screen though.  They could have gone through that whole scene and still left it up to interpretation whether Stannis gets his freak on...it might have made the eventual shadow baby more chilling in that respect, much in the way it is in the books.  Down the line, the Davos/Mel scene where she offers herself to him, that could confirm it then, but some ambiguity would have served the tension of the story better, as well as given the non-book viewers something more to debate at the water cooler...-Cersei. Too much attempts are being made to make her sympathetic to the audience. She ordered the killing of the bastards in the book and that is how it should have stayed. And damn it, Han shot first too!-Bronn as Lord Commander makes sense. Bywater is just another character to add.I wonder at the condensing of too much though.  Not having some of Tyrion's appointees and people about makes his fall after the Blackwater a little less satisfying.  Everyone he surrounds himself with before the Blackwater is either dead or turned on him by the end of it and it really helps motivate him in ASOS and beyond.  Peter Dinklage will certainly not lose his nose either.  I do have concerns about how this will play out down the line, but I'll keep the faith over all.

You can't skip backwards a few pages to remind yourself what happened in the previous chapter, you can't re-read the page because you're on to the next scene. A large audience that has not read the books is going to have to grasp where this shadowbaby is coming from and I guarantee you, we will find non-book readers who will be very confused about what just happened at the end of Episode 4.

Shireen isn't taken out, the line referred to stillborn sons.2. Rakharo's death was due to the actor leaving to do another movie.3. Bywater is not essential; he's a minor character who dies in the book he was introduced in. Having Bronn in his place to betray Tyrion after the battle will be so much more resonant than having one minor character replaced by another.
483	MtnLion	2012-04-12	The way they are focusing on Ros, I think that Ros will be the one who will be forced to marry Ramsay in the show as fake Arya.That thought crossed my mind, too.  As for the other suggestion, as a fake Sansa, I think that Sansa has another part to play in the Eerie. I do not like that Ros survived the crying situation.  It would have been totally in Littlefinger's character to offer teh customer the alternative whore, as he did, then find someone to escort Ros away, permanently.  I kind of find the idea that Petyr would stoop to threats with Cersei and Ros as incongruant with his nature.  He has a golden rule, to always keep his hands clean.
484	night light	2012-04-12	Tywin's bastardHe had a completely neutral look when he was watching so it was obviously just him keeping a close eye on his business (information is power).Huh. He had a neutral expression? Didn't notice. I was too busy rolling my eyes.If you don't think that's anything new I suppose we don't need have to have Joffrey do anything sadistic anymore since he already did that in the first season and we couldn't possibly gain anything from continuing to follow his character on that path, right?I thought I was pretty clear initally but obviously not. Let me restate it: this was 1) a new scene which 2) did not progress the plot and 3) provided no new character insights. Joffrey does plenty of awful things in the books. In the show, these will 1) not be new scenes - I'll be annoyed if they do create any since there are many from which to choose already, 2) progress the plot (e.g. inciting the riot) and/or 3) provide new character insights - with respect to Sansa, Tyrion, the Hound, Margaery, and the Queen of Thorns amongst others. I honestly don't see how you can draw that comparison.

485	Cruella	2012-04-12	To be blunt, if we're going to whine about characters like Bywater, we might as well just not watch the series, and writers might as well stop producing the show.
486	tearloch	2012-04-12	Episode 3 is Catelyn discussing peace terms with Renly when he gets the news about the siege of Storms End, then Stannis meets Renly in episode 4, and episode 5 suggests that the shadowbaby will be the capper to episode 4. I think they're going to blend the second shadowbaby in with the first and have Davos row Melisandre over as she gives birth to the one that kills Renly.Thanks.  That makes sense.  The killing of Renly and the capture of Storms End can be blended into one sequence to move the plot along, with little to no draw backs.  I wonder if Edric Storm is gonna be brought into the story.  Much like Stannis' daughter, I don't think it would be an important omission in the grand scheme of the show.  Really all he did was create a mild conflict between Stannis' duty and Melisandre's desires and magic.  So after they meet in the field, Renly retires to Storms End.  Simple enough...just move his army closer to Storms End.  Why would a fancy boy like Renly sleep in a tent when he was a nice comfy castle near by.  Davos takes Melisandre into Storms End to kill Renly, instead of the castellan (sp?).  I buy it.
487	tearloch	2012-04-12	Does anyone else think that although the Stannis actor is doing a good job, when he says	"I cannot defeat my brother in the field"its one of the worst delivered lines in the series.I think too many are taking the image we have of Stannis from the books as the real Stannis.  Remember, the book is all through the eyes of other characters.  The Stannis we know from the books is mostly derived from the POV of Davos, who owes everything he has (and even things he doesn't have, like some fingers) to Stannis.I took Stannis' comment in the show to mean more along the line of:"I [and my 5000 troops] cannot defeat my brother [and 100,000 troops that should be mine] in the field."I think it shows that while Stannis is a very capable commander, he is not stupid.  He is a realist.  In the book, doesn't Stannis want to defeat Renly in single combat?  This goes along the same lines.  He knows his army is no match for Renly's.
488	tearloch	2012-04-12	1. Shireen isn't taken out, the line referred to stillborn sons. 2. Rakharo's death was due to the actor leaving to do another movie. 3. Bywater is not essential; he's a minor character who dies in the book he was introduced in. Having Bronn in his place to betray Tyrion after the battle will be so much more resonant than having one minor character replaced by another.So far, the only omission of characters so far that I am truly disappointed in is the Reed kids.  The rest, I am totally OK with.1. Shireen:  are we sure she will be in the show?  The scene on the beach burning the seven, after Stannis gets his sword, he sticks it in the sand and starts to storm off.  He doubles back and gets his wife.  ONLY his wife.  No child was there.  Might be insignificant, but could also mean Stannis (HBO type) is childless.  In the end, does it matter?  What did Shireen ever do to advance the plot of the series?2. Patchface:  Really?  Upset about that?  Again, what did he ever do to advance the plot, except for put out some jiberish that some take of a prophecy of future events?  No real loss here.3. Bywater:  As stated above, no real loss.  He is easily replaced with another existing character that will eventually betray Tyrion.  Bronn has already said he will do pretty much anything for money.4. Rakharo (or whoever the bloodrider was):  Not a big loss.  Not really a big loss in terms of the overall plot.  In the end, you get Dany with a hodge podge of a Queens Guard.  Barriston Selmy.  The fat pit fighter.  Joras for a while.  It doesn't matter who they really are.  She has a band of misfits that are following her.5. The Blackfish:  Still not sure if he is cut or not.  I think he is, but who knows.  I personally love the Blackfish, and would really have enjoyed seeing him on screen, but as I think about it, he really has done very little for the overall plot (in 5 books).  I am not gonna shed a tear if Brynden Rivers is axed from the HBO series, even though I truly love his persona in the books.6. The Reed kids:  This is the one that have both a personal and plot objection.  My favorite dialogue in the entire series was when the Reeds came to Winterfell and swore their loyalty to the Starks.  Moving!  But cutting them creates alot of problems with the plot moving forward.  Yes, I get that Osha can serve in a similar manner in terms of Bran's development of his "abilities".  In fact, she is probably a better guide for him to get into the north.  But who on earth will take Rickon?  Will he go with Bran?  The omission of the Reeds (who still could be brought into the series later without a ton of problems, if HBO wants to do it) is the only one that I see as truly affecting the overall plot line of the show.
489	Aegnor	2012-04-12	Not sure if it's mentioned in this thread or not, but did anyone notice that Melisandre tells Davos' son Matthos "A death by fire is the purest death". That totally forshadow's his death in the Battle of the Blackwater.
490	Silverx2	2012-04-12	Agreed on the Reeds. Bran and the Reeds was one of my Favorite storylines and to not have it makes me sad.
491	Mr. E	2012-04-12	Agreed on the Reeds. Bran and the Reeds was one of my Favorite storylines and to not have it makes me sad.What confuses/interests me about the Reeds is I don't understand how D&D are going to work in anything about the TOJ now...we already didn't get the crucial scene in the first season (ned's dream) but without the Reeds there is literally no more connection to Howland, the last person who knew what happened...which either means that there's going to have to be some creatine jerry-rigging to fit this all in, or the show's going to deviate from the book extremely and not have R+L=J.And Silverx2, we need to talk about your avatar pic.
492	Silverx2	2012-04-12	Yes, it is quite nice, I've had it on here for a couple of years now...

There's good ambiguity in television.  Mysteries can be left out there for the discerning viewer to piece together.  The whole idea of "show don't tell".  If Mel attempts to seduce Stannis and he says no, but maybe he seems tempted and then there's a shadow baby that looks like Stannis?  Real good viewers will catch on to things that are foreshadowed well.Hell the first time we see Stannis' shadow in the books, there's no indication that it has anything to do with Melisandre's seduction of him.  Unless of course, they're going to combine Davos taking Melisandre under Storm's End and the killing of Renly into one scene to save time and skip Edric Storm all together...Bottom line, the seduction of Stannis was done in a clunky manner and felt out of place with the deliberate nature of it.Not sure if it's mentioned in this thread or not, but did anyone notice that Melisandre tells Davos' son Matthos "A death by fire is the purest death". That totally forshadow's his death in the Battle of the Blackwater.This statement is a case in point.  Readers will get the reference right away, but viewer who haven't read the books might just look back upon this statement at the end of the season and think that the writers might have just been that clever.

495	True Northerner	2012-04-12	Renly will be in Episode 3, but he's not going to get killed by the end, right? While for book readers it's a dramatic moment, I think killing a character the first episode we see him (this season), would lose a bit of drama.  Also, Im looking forward to the actress who plays Margery. I loved her as Anne Boleyn in the Tudors!
496	Mr. E	2012-04-12	Yes, it is quite nice, I've had it on here for a couple of years now...Damn it. That means I'm the Bizarro in this equation.
497	MtnLion	2012-04-12	Mr. E and Silerx2, it seems to me that the show may skip the hints to Jon's parentage, at least until Bran comes into power.  I think it will be something to watch the battle at the Tower of Joy through Bran's eyes.
498	hesitantreader	2012-04-12	I always surprised at how much credit people give Littlefinger, this is the same guy who told a story about the knife that was used to attack Bran, a story that could very easily been disproved.  He clearly makes mistakes in the book and is not an expert at the game of thrones.
I have no problem with the way he has been shown in the show, be it with Cersei in episode one or with the whores in episode two.  If there is one constant in the books it is that no one is perfect.

If there is one constant in the books it is that no one is perfect.I see the story about the knife as a gamble, and indicative of his character; unlike Varys, who plays the long game and is incredibly meticulous in his plotting, Littlefinger improvises and plays for short-term advantage, sometimes very impulsively. As we see later from his speech to Sansa, sometimes he does things for the sheer hell of it to muddy the waters.
501	Triskan	2012-04-12	Just a few quick thoughts of mine:-The guy playing Balon is amazing; incredible gravitas on screen.  And everything about Pyke and the Iron Islands was spot on to how I picture it in my head.  Great. -The Arya/Gendry scene was really fun-All of Tyrion's scenes were great.  I hate Slynt, as any sensible man would, and it's great to watch Tyrion punk him.  I think PD is doing an even better job this season in the early going. -Dillane is just not working as Stannis for me thus far.  Hopefully that changes. And now for my extremely sophomoric comment:-Any worries that CVH wasn't hot enough or sultry enough to be Mel have been laid to rest.
502	boojam	2012-04-13	Agreed on the Reeds. Bran and the Reeds was one of my Favorite storylines and to not have it makes me sad.Ok, I gonna just say it. I am re-reading ASoS ,..., the Reeds and Bran's storyline in that book , except for a little suspense stuff is about as boring as Tom Bombadil in LTOR. If had of been Tolkien I would have killed him off!So there.
503	ScientistGirl26	2012-04-13	Was one of the weakest episodes in the series thus far, imo.  Not because of the changes, I don't care about that really, its just that it felt disjointed and dragged on too much in the middle. Also, and I say this for the first time ever, there was far too much sex. I was fine with Stannis/Mel scene (although, correct me if I'm wrong, this is a change from the books, yes? I thought it was never clear if Stannis had an affair or was seduced while asleep) but the Theon/Captain's daughter scene dragged on even worse than it did on the page and the brothel scene was completely unnecessary. I would much rather have preferred either another Arya scene, or some checking in with a character not in the episode; maybe show Joffrey being randomly cruel and stupid.I agree with everything you said. I could have lived without having seen Theon Greyjoy finger his sister on the horse, he is a loser.Sex scenes in the brothel were a complete unnecessary soft porn material, and while we're at it - producers, can you throw in some athletic looking young men in here and show their asses? Women watch this show too, you know.When Stannis and Melisandre were having sex, I couldn't stop thinking about how those little figurines on the table must have poked Melisandre's back. Anyone else?Rakharo's death - I knew it was coming, but man oh man. The first time I saw him in Episode 3 of the first series, my jaw dropped and I was like who IS this?? where, what, how? saliva all over the place. But seriously, he was one of the best characters in the show.

Though unfortunately, and I know that horse has already been flogged here..  the age thing wouldn't work.

505	Greywolf2375	2012-04-13	I hadn't read the whole thread so I don't know if someone mentioned it before but I liked the part when Tyrion read the letter from Mormont and the small council just laughed and left the room. I wonder how many of them will live to rue this.I did like that scene - while I did miss Tyrion mocking Thorne, I thought they did a good job of tying together the knowledge of the snarks & grumpkins being shared with the south and it being dismissed.
506	Roose Seal	2012-04-13	When Stannis and Melisandre were having sex, I couldn't stop thinking about how those little figurines on the table must have poked Melisandre's back. Anyone else?That's all I could think as well. "That table looks like the last place I'd chose to have sex"
507	Hedge Lawyer	2012-04-13	That freaked me out, too.  It was way more graphic than Cersie and Jamie in the tower.  I know she wanted to trick Theon, but this makes Asha look like she wants her kid brother, as she knew who he was the whole time.I agree.  HBO completely botched that scene, IMO.  In the book, Asha is teasing Theon but is also careful to move his hands away and not let him take things too far.  Then, once she reveals her true identity, she makes it crystal clear that she was just trying to embarass Theon.  She outright belittles Theon for the things that he did and said.  That was one of my favorite scenes from the entire series; I laughed out loud when I read it.The show had none of that nuance.  They didn't even have "Yara" try to resist Theon.  It merely looked like she let her brother finger her.  They could have taken 30 seconds from some other scene  to elaborate on this to help non-readers understand the situation.  Maybe they could have cut the beginning of the brothel scene (but then we'd have to lose the oh so important "wiping of the whore's mouth", and we can't lose that!), or maybe the Stannis sex scene.  As it is, it just looks like another intentional incest moment.I'm not enjoying Season 2 as much as I did Season 1.  I think that the story has already become too disparate for HBO to capture it properly.  It feels disjointed.  Everyone gets superficial treatment, things are magnified or rushed to an extent that it distorts the charaterization, and you're left with odd scenes like the Cersei-Littlefinger scene in episode 1, the Theon-Yara groping, and the Stannis sex that aren't really explained or don't seem to appropriately capture the spirit of the characters.  That's a bad sign, considering how tight the narrative is in ACoK in comparison with the later books in the series.  I don't see how HBO can do ADWD.

508	Free Northman	2012-04-13	I fully agree with the complaint that the sex is over the top.
It is not even necessary.
What do the whore scenes add to the story? The Stannis/Mellisandre scene is justifiable and adds to the atmosphere and builds Melisandre's character as a seductive enchantress, but the repetitive Theon sex scenes - that guy must have had more sex in the series thus far than he has in real life - and the whorehouse scenes are frankly off-putting.
Especially since I'm trying to introduce my wife to the series, and she has stated openly that she loves it, but is put off by the semi-pornographic parts that add nothing to the story.
509	gramblor	2012-04-13	I really never figured that people who read ASOIAF are actually such prudes when it comes to seeing nudity on screen when they read about rape/murder/etc.....
The sex scenes are used tactfully:
1. Scene with Ros in Episode 1 explains that she has a form of management position in the brothel. Most likely to combine her in with the role that Alayaya plays for Tyrion. Also acts as a segway for purging Roberts bastards. People would be like "WTF why are they all of a sudden killing babies and shit?" if they didn't have that segway to it.
2. The sex scene with the captains daughter is in the books and serves to portray Theon thinking that when he returns home he will be received as a hero and the rightful heir to Pyke.
3. The Asha/Yara scene, while I admit they got it a little wrong, still serves its purpose. Lets not get too disturbed by the fact that Theon touches her Vag, shes squeezing his dick like its going outta style in the books.
4. Stannis and Mel doin' it serves the purpose of explaining the shadow babies that are to come. The general population will not have read the books and have the insight and knowledge to know what is going on. Without this being explicitly shown, you would end up having a huge WTF feeling from the general population. Also, its heavily implied/drilled into our heads that this happens in the books (although off screen).
5. The LF/Ros scene in episode 2 is the only scene that really didn't need to be there.
In total, the sex scenes in the show represent MAYBE 6-7 minutes of screen time COMBINED. This isn't very much time, its not like they would be able to tell an in depth story or make some character arc more spectacular. So many people have their too far in the clouds to understand this.

516	Hedge Lawyer	2012-04-13	Yes!  Thank you!  Why did we need to see Theon banging some rando in the bowels of a ship?As others pointed out, that was in the book.  He led her on the entire trip, used her for her body, and then abandoned her to her fate.  It was used to show Theon shallowness and lack of character.  I actually thought that that scene was well done on the show.
517	Hedge Lawyer	2012-04-13	She squeezed his package numerous times in the book, even once at a feast after she'd revealed she was his sister.  I fail to see the difference.In the book, the squeezing was clearly in the context of Asha mocking Theon.  Besides, she was squeezing in the book.  Theon was doing far more than squeeing or quickly grabbing Yara on the show.  He was full on fingering her.  It was not equivalent to Asha's squeezing- rather, it would be like if Asha was j*cking him off in the book.  It went a level farther on the show than in the book, and it was made worse because it was basically stripped from the context.The show turned a funny scene of overconfident, somehwat delusional Theon being humiliated by his crafty sister into another creepy incest scene.  Yara looked like she wanted sexual gratification from Theon despite knowing that he was her brother.  That completely misses the point of the scene in the book.  HBO botched the scene.  I don't remember many (if any) scenes from Season 1 that I thought were poorly done.  I can think of several poorly done scenes from Season 2 and we're only two episodes in.

518	zippypoodle	2012-04-13	Thanks for setting people straight JS Crews. Perhaps people who want to complain about changes from the books should actually recall the books correctly first.
And for the prudes, maybe we can get the writers to produce alternate versions of the sex scenes where the characters eat tea and crumpets and wear Victorian outfits.
519	boojam	2012-04-13	Yes!  Thank you!  Why did we need to see Theon banging some rando in the bowels of a ship?Except for Theon's first sight of Pyke, I was guessing that D&D would skip that scene to get on with the Theon/Asha encounter, which they shortened greatly.That was a real waste of time, Theon won't even see that character again, Asha's character was developed in her interaction with her brother, good theatrical fodder, so that seemed a fumble for D&D.

520	boojam	2012-04-13	Meanwhile, she spends 2 chapters squeezing his cock, at least once after revealing who she is.  I guess you are talking Asha here?My take was that Asha could turn it on or off with men just to show who was boss.With Theon it seemed , since she knew who he was, she was probing him (so to speak) more for psychological info for herself and well as her father. She had him figured out by the time they got to Pyke.

And, yes, I was talking about the Asha/Yara character in response to people being sceeved-out by the incest-y feel of Theon being in the general neighborhood of her genitals while on the horse.

I've watching it 3 times and it was pretty clear to me he got his fingers just below her pants; not to be vulgar, but he mighta felt bush, but no clit.  He wasn't far enough in there.  Where I think the scene failed was in cutting some of the flirty banter between the two when he thought she was the shipwright's wife.
523	Dragon of Valyria	2012-04-13	Of course, what the actor actually did and what was intended to come across are likely two different things entirely.
524	Free Northman	2012-04-14	I can only convey what a number of people I've introduced to the TV series - who have not read the books - have said to me.
The story is great, but the gratuitous sex scenes add very little other than shock content.
Was Braveheart a poorer movie because William Wallace didn't go all Boogie Nights on his wife or the princess?
Was Gladiator poorer for not having full blown nudity for random non plot advancing sex orgies?
All of these movies have plenty of guts and gore and tragedy and suspense without having to include over the top graphic sex scenes for no particular reason other than to tittilate some frat boys.
For the record, I'm a guy in my early thirties, but I don't feel the need to get a porn fix everythime I watch Game of Thrones.
It's just unnecessary, as far as I'm concerned.

Watch True Blood, Rome, Entourage, Deadwood, or any of their other productions, and you'll find the same.  And, for the record, GRRM was pretty graphic in the books too.  At least the show didn't treat us to seeing Drogo's manhood "glistening wetly" as the books did.  People should just be glad we got the show at all.  If the worst thing I have to see is Littlefinger wiping cum off a whore's mouth in return for getting to see ASOIAF in live-action, I'll muddle through with a smile and call it a big, big win.

It seems they believe the sex scenes add to the popularity of the show.I don't see how that logic works. If they got the age restriction down to 16 for example, surely that would add a million or so extra viewers for them.And all it would take would be cutting the most graphic sex scenes. Not all of them, just the ones that are most graphic and non-plot advancing. You could keep all the gore, which hasn't been all that much in any case.So to me, they're actually sabotaging their own cause by adding full frontal nudity for the ships captain's daughter (who is damn ugly by the way) getting it on with Theon, or the nameless whores in Littlefinger's brothel etc.
527	BlackTalon	2012-04-14	I have watched S2E2 for about the fifth time and I think I actually like the TV version of the scene better than the book one ... it seems a good deal more realistic, by now the book dialogue seems not very credible and contrived in comparison.

Theon's tragedy , he does not recognize his weakness. He was indeed brave at Robb's side, but Asha ferrets out his inability as a military leader , much less the captain of war ships. We get the impression if he had of been raised on the Iron islands Asha would have still trumped him. The Stannis-Mel scene has a meaning that I don't think non readers picked up on, tho if one pays close attention in that scene the information is there.Jaime - Cersei in the first season is a vital plot motivation ...it might could have been handled with more sophistication , but there it is.The Sexposition , well that's an odd narrative device (I can't remember if George did in the books?)... sometimes it turns out to be zero sum, such as the Ros - Pycelle first season, Little Finger and Ros in the second.As I have noted, the Theon - captain's daughter thing was a waste of good plot time, we had been there and done that.I don't know if D&D have a story consultant besides George but someone should tell them (as fine a writers as they are!)"you guys need to tighten things up, we only have 10 episodes."
529	teemo	2012-04-14	I've getting really sick of all the gratuitous sex scenes/sexposition.  I personally don't mind, but I think it's kind of giving the show a bad name to some people and taken less seriously.  My boyfriend refers to it as a "medieval soap opera" with over-the-top, ridiculous sexual gratuity.  I'll say anything to try to convince him to like it more, such as - "there's tons a lesbian scenes!" and he kind of had the same response someone else on here did.  "Why would I want to watch a series of a show for some sex scenes???" /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />
530	legba11	2012-04-14	There are tons of gratuitous HBO! moments.  The books are graphic too, The Lannister twin reunion from SoS comes to mind...  In both cases I find it unnecessary.  It's more in your face on the show as you have people actually pretending to do it, as opposed to some chubby hippy just writing it.
531	Hedge Lawyer	2012-04-14	I don't buy that he was "full on fingering her."  Dude would have to have some awfully long fingers.

Where I think the scene failed was in cutting some of the flirty banter between the two when he thought she was the shipwright's wife.We can debate his technique, but ultimately your last sentence underscores the problem with the scene.  HBO didn't set it up- it just looked like Yara was relaxing and letting her brother grope her for her pleasure.  There was little hint of Yara's goal in that scene- to take the measure of Theon and, once she decided on his worth (or lack thereof), her decision to humiliate him.  She squeezed him, but not out of her lust or her desire.  In the show, she just reclines and lets the magic happen.  It was disappointing to me ( a reader) and confusing to non-readers.  It just looked like another random incest scene.
532	Strider	2012-04-14	Does anyone else think that although the Stannis actor is doing a good job, when he says "I cannot defeat my brother in the field" its one of the worst delivered lines in the series.Yes.  You have touched on my single serious criticism of the second season.  I am not a purist when it comes to TV/movie adaptations of novels.  Novels and film are two very different mediums.  Most importantly, Martin's Song of Fire and Ice novels are particularly convoluted and unwieldy ... and long.  Successful adaptation of these books will require often drastic creative decisions, including changes to the narrative, creation of new characters, and changes to the established characters.  This is all expected.  We cannot rightly expect faithfulness in all the details.  If we who know the novels (I've read them all twice) are going to enjoy the HBO series, we must find a way to bracket what we know and to enjoy the series on its own terms.  This is difficult to do, I know.Quite frankly, I find most of the complaints about changes and additions to be nit-picky and even silly.  Has LIttlefinger's character been severely distorted by his encounter with Cersei or by the revelation of his ruthless pimpery.  Of course not.  Has Stannis's character been severely distorted by his violent bedding of Melisandre.  Of course not.  Has the story been ruined by Craster offering the newborn to the Others.  Of course not.  Yes, liberties with the text have been taken; but as I said, the series needs to be appreciated on its own terms and not judged by meticulous conformity to the novels.  Many (most?) of the viewers do not have the advantage (or is it disadvantage?) of having read Martin's books. But that being said, I am extremely disappointed so far with the series' characterization of Stannis.  He is being presented as a weak, even desperate man.  Would the book-Stannis have ever said this line?  Book-Stannis is a formidable warrior and commander, known for his steely will.  Even to Melisandre I do not see him as ever confiding doubt and fear regarding the possibility of victory.  Others might fear or anticipate defeat but not Stannis.   Am I wrong?  Or am I being nit-picky, too?  /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

By ACoK,the story is already too spread out, with too many viewpoint characters at too many different places, for the show to be able to present with nuance.HBO either should have given Season 2 15 episodes instead of 10, or HBO should have more drastically changed the story from the beginning to be able to present a more focused and narrow story.  For instance, they could have written Renly and Loras out of the story from the beginning and had Stannis at King's Landing in season 1.  He could have then left for Dragonstone after King Robert's death, and he could  have began Season 2 with the support of the Stormlands and plotting to attack King's Landing.  That way, people would know who Stannis is, and Season 2 could have focused on developing him.As it is, the show feels too disjointed to me. HBO is taking the middle path- trying to stick as closely to the books as possible within the alloted 10 episodes- and it's feeling over-compressed, rushed, and shallow.  My non-reader friends don't really even know who Stannis is, given that he has received about 5 minutes of screentime so far (2 of which had him hunched over and grunting on top of Mel).  Blackwater isn't going to be impressive if no one knows or cares who Stannis is.

HBO is taking the middle path- trying to stick as closely to the books as possible within the alloted 10 episodes- and it's feeling over-compressed, rushed, and shallow.  My non-reader friends don't really even know who Stannis is, given that he has received about 5 minutes of screentime so far (2 of which had him hunched over and grunting on top of Mel).  Blackwater isn't going to be impressive if no one knows or cares who Stannis is.I tend to agree that the writers probably should have cut out many of the characters and events in order to create a more focused story.  A Song of Fire & Ice may simply not be adaptable to the screen without radical surgery.  But can you imagine the cry and hue such surgery would have generated? I hope that if the series lasts long enough the writers will give serious consideration to dramatically eliminating many of the narrative threads and characters from Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons.  These are the two weakest books in the series, almost qualifying as narrative failures.  I don't know how they can be integrated into a compelling cinematic story. Bottomline:  we who love the books need to give the writers plenty of slack.  They need the freedom to make a successful adaptation, which probably means more departures from the source material, not less.But I am enjoying the second season.  The production values are exceptionally high.  We'll just have to wait and see if the writers can pull everything together.

A Song of Fire & Ice may simply not be adaptable to the screen without radical surgery.  But can you imagine the cry and hue such surgery would have generated? George would not have signed that contract.He had repeated offers to do film versions.He wanted as much elaboration as possible. He knew what HBO could do with a multi season format.That was the gamble he was willing to take, GOT could have flopped the first season.Now , George knows full well the compromises of TV , having worked in it and written teleplays.So I don't know what he has worked out with D&D, that how much latitude he has given them.To some extent , now, the cast is having an effect on the story, D&D just have too good an eye for fine actors and the actors have made the characters , to a large extent, made those parts come more alive than the prose!I would think all producers wish they had the richness of the first three novels. All now depends on ratings and HBO's bank account.There is plenty to adapt for seasons 3, 4 (&5?) from CoK and SoS. From there D&D with George's blessing may have to wing it, because as much as I like it as a reader, as a visual narrative it's gonna get complex, but good writers can be clever... we shall see.
536	boojam	2012-04-14	I know she did, but for whatever reason, it grossed me out, and I'm one of the defenders of them showing Mel and Stannis making abominations.  I just can't put my finger on why it freaks me out J.S., but Ewwwwwww.Asha uses her empowerment shrewdly , more subtlety power play there than your giving George credit for.Her's is the Iron Way (so to speak).

I can't see them having Dany sit around Meereen for two season, I can't see them devoting time to making Briene and Victarion and Quentyn Martell and Areo Hotah and Griff and all the others into feature characters on the show.  I wouldn't be surprised to have them do away with the Euron/Victarion and the Dorne threads altogether.I think that seasons 3 and 4 (if there is one) are going to be based off of ASOS.  If there's a season 5, I see it being dramatically different from the books.
538	mormont	2012-04-14	not to be vulgarWhy say 'not to be vulgar' when you've been nothing but?People, yes, there are explicit sex scenes. That's no excuse for talking about them as if you were eleven years old and just discovered your older brother's porn magazine collection. Class it up a bit, please, or posts will be deleted. Take that as an official mod warning.
539	Dragon greyscale	2012-04-14	In the book, the squeezing was clearly in the context of Asha mocking Theon.  Besides, she was squeezing in the book.  Theon was doing far more than squeeing or quickly grabbing Yara on the show.  He was full on fingering her.  It was not equivalent to Asha's squeezing- rather, it would be like if Asha was j*cking him off in the book.  It went a level farther on the show than in the book, and it was made worse because it was basically stripped from the context.The show turned a funny scene of overconfident, somehwat delusional Theon being humiliated by his crafty sister into another creepy incest scene.  Yara looked like she wanted sexual gratification from Theon despite knowing that he was her brother.  That completely misses the point of the scene in the book.I agree and I'd like to add that the creepiness also comes from the sexual power relations in the scene. Book asha is very assertive while tv asha is a tease... big difference. Yara flirts by acting as someone who wants to be taken by theon, while asha takes what she wants herself. She's much more sassy and empowered. I think that's what makes the scenes feel so different. In the show it's one-way groping which takes away a lot of yara as a powerful female character.
540	Dornish Hen	2012-04-14	But that being said, I am extremely disappointed so far with the series' characterization of Stannis.  He is being presented as a weak, even desperate man.  Would the book-Stannis have ever said this line?  Book-Stannis is a formidable warrior and commander, known for his steely will.  Even to Melisandre I do not see him as ever confiding doubt and fear regarding the possibility of victory.  Others might fear or anticipate defeat but not Stannis.   Am I wrong?  Or am I being nit-picky, too?  /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />No, I don't think you are.  Stannis is supposed to be strong and steely, not brooding and sulky as he has been portrayed so far.  He believes in himself, his military abilities, and his right to the throne. In the show he seems to only believe in Mel, which makes him appear to be of weaker character than I would liked to have seen.

Take that as an official mod warning. Apologies, but I'm not sure of any other way I could've gotten the point across.  Re: the "in the bowels of the boat" scene, I was trying to point out that the corresponding scene in the book is actually *MORE* graphic (and gross) than what the show gave us, not less; I guess I went too far with the imagery.  And, as for the comment that drew the warning above, I suppose I could've used clinical terms, I guess.  Otherwise, I'm not sure how else to've said it. Anyway, my apologies to the community.

In the show he seems to only believe in Mel, which makes him appear to be of weaker character than I would liked to have seen.I agree on most, except for the sulkiness comment.  He sulks, more or less, constantly about everyone loving Robert and Renly but not him.  He says something at one point like Robert could urinate in a drinking vessel and men would call it a fermented grape beverage, but I give them clear, cold water and they mutter to themselves about how strange it tastes.
543	Lady Katherine	2012-04-14	I've getting really sick of all the gratuitous sex scenes/sexposition.  I personally don't mind, but I think it's kind of giving the show a bad name to some people and taken less seriously.  My boyfriend refers to it as a "medieval soap opera" with over-the-top, ridiculous sexual gratuity.  I'll say anything to try to convince him to like it more, such as - "there's tons a lesbian scenes!" and he kind of had the same response someone else on here did.  "Why would I want to watch a series of a show for some sex scenes???" /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />Thank you for so eloquently saying what I've been trying to but couldn't quite get the words right /drunk.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drunk:' />I understand that there is a lot of sex in the books.  A lot of that sex also helps us readers really understand certain characters as well (ie. Jaime and Cersei for one).  I also understand that the show is on HBO.  I'm cool with risque stuff.  I'm a HUGE True Blood fangirl.  I'm also a fan of Boardwalk Empire.  My favorite TV show of ALL TIME is Sex and the City.  HBO rocks because they don't have to deal with the censorship that other TV networks have to.That being said, it is my opinion (just my opinion!- don't yell at me!) that a lot of the sex scenes are overshadowing other very important events and plot lines.  When I was at home visiting my parents for Easter last week, I watched "The Night Lands" at their house just because that's where I happened to beat  that time.  Needless to say there were lots of super awkward moments with my mom sitting next to me!Idk...I'm only 25 and I teach high school.  Maybe having to yell at those dang kids for talking about inappropriate stuff has pushed me into premature prudish-ness!
544	ScientistGirl26	2012-04-15	That being said, it is my opinion (just my opinion!- don't yell at me!) that a lot of the sex scenes are overshadowing other very important events and plot lines.Yes! Thank you. I don't have a problem with sex scenes as long as they don't steal too much screen time from other events and characters that I find a lot more interesting.For example, they could have thrown in some random additional drama at Dothraki, have some members of the tribe rebel and fight with Daenerys...or they could have shown Joffrey molesting more random innocent people...or show night walkers slaughtering someone in the forest (that was one of the best scenes in Season 1)...or more scenes with Bran, I think they are treating Bran too superficially in this season and giving him less scenes than he deserves...anyway, I can think of at least 10 decent things they could have done with the characters.They throw it all away to set a world record in a number of sex scenes in one episode? I think it's a wrong move. Everyone knows what whores look like and what they do. It doesn't add anything to the plot, One or two tastefully done sex scenes per episode is enough to attract certain targeted audience. Doesn't matter if the books are loaded with sex, the show should adjust to response of the audience to Season 1 which was amazing and I think everyone will agree. Season 1 had a perfect amount of sex scenes and they were much more tastefully done. Anything more than that is too much and it crosses the line between art and pornography.
545	Conchobar	2012-04-15	The sex scenes are strange for me. I feel uncomfortable sometimes watching them, and I usually don't mind sex scenes in programs. I love this show though, I love everything about it. The actors they have chosen, the sets, the world they have materialized.
546	Roose Seal	2012-04-15	It's not about what is okay to show and what is not, it's about what is relevant to the plot and/or character development and what is not.Case in point:-Theon banging the captain's daughter like she's an animal: relevant to Theon's characterization. He treats women like garbage, he values his cock over anything else, he's dangerously proud, etc. Could the same thing be accomplished without titties ? Maybe, but in this case it's not too distracting.-Littlefinger wiping cum off a whore's mouth: not relevant to ANYTHING. It just makes me picture a room full of pimple-ridden geeky writers wearing stained shirts snorting like pubescent boys when one of them suggests the idea. It does not make the show "adult" or "edgy", but rather the exact opposite ie. childish and mundane.As for the show having lots of sex just because the books have lots of sex, that's a moot point. On screen sex (or violence for that matter) is not the same as written sex (or violence) and the sex scenes in the show are not half as graphic as their book counterparts, for a good reason: there's a huge difference between reading about Drogo's manhood "glistening wetly" and having a close up of a tumescent and shiny penis dripping with cum on screen. I don't care much for the former but I care even less for the latter, and I'm sure lots of people would echo that sentiment.I'm not prude by any stretch of imagination, but if I want to see porn, I watch porn.

Which by the way Asha also wants, but that's another story.

548	legba11	2012-04-15	Well put, Lost, what I mean as the HBO! moments are the ones which are just pointless sex (or other "taboos") which HBO seems compelled to add to their shows now that cable networks are challenging their territory for serious high-quality drama.
549	Silverx2	2012-04-16	i just want to toss out that the whore who had cum wiped from her mouth is the same one that Ros is with when we have little fingers classic "play with her ass" line.
in season one Ros is kind of this hot shit awesome whore, and this other girl is kind of, lesser in a way.  then in season 2, ros is crying, and the other one is just blowing through guys(pun intended).
its a weird reversal of fortunes, and something i'm sure only i noticed.
550	The late lady stark	2012-04-16	Asha was ok, I wasn't really taken in by the actor but they didn't keep the whole scene.  Balon kinda reffered to her and she made a joke about Theon's garb, and earlier on horseback, she just kinda let Theon play with her while he brags.  She didn't come off as a swaggering, confident type - wishing she had been born a man like Cersei, but she really didn't leave an impression.  I'm a little miffed about the cliffhanger and I don't understand it.  How hard would it have been for Gilly to have said, "he gives our sons to the Gods?"  Leaving it a mystery to the viewer as to exactly what that means.  If someone can explain this decision to me, please do.  I'm not a purist by any stretch, changes for expediency, or because of budget limitation or time constraints is fine.  But that ticked me off.  Where is Patchface? Where is this dynamic between Queen's Men and King's Men?  Where are the Reeds?  I'm not upset about the damphair because he can be omitted without any great loss untill the events of the 4th book.  I think this is the start of some serious deviation.  Not that's necessarily a bad thing.  I remember an interview with the showrunners that said each season won't so much tell the story of the book, but when it's viewed as a whole, will tell the story of "ASOIAF."  Which I'm fine with.I think damphair shows up later, I saw Theon getting baptized by him in a "next episode" thing.
551	J_Crews	2012-04-16	I think damphair shows up later, I saw Theon getting baptized by him in a "next episode" thing.Damphair has not been cast.  That was just an unnamed priest of the Drowned God, though the dude did have a certain presence.
552	EgoistMusketeer	2012-04-16	Should they even cast Damphair? Other characters deserving screen time have been left out (Blackfish, Jojen, Meera, Ramsay? etc.) Why bother with him when an undeveloped drowned priest can do his part. Save the casting for Victarion and Euron.

Other characters deserving screen time have been left out (Blackfish, Jojen, Meera, Ramsay? etc.) Why bother with him when an undeveloped drowned priest can do his part. Save the casting for Victarion and Euron.Unless GRRM has shared with D&D that he'll be important in the future, I'd say he's out.  If so, they'll introduce him when and if he's important.  He's been a pretty minor character thus far in the books.
554	teemo	2012-04-17	I guess we could just pretend that was Damphair, but there's really no reason for him to have an official role for him, I guess.  He hasn't really done too much.
555	Ran	2012-04-17	Random Drowned Priest. Or maybe Damphair. They're leaving options open, basically.
556	J_Crews	2012-04-17	I guess we could just pretend that was Damphair, but there's really no reason for him to have an official role for him, I guess.  He hasn't really done too much. Quite right.
557	J_Crews	2012-04-17	Random Drowned Priest. Or maybe Damphair. They're leaving options open, basically.My thoughts as well.
558	Weeping Sore	2012-06-29	Way late to this thread- watching on my iPad by logging in with a friend's HBO credentials-
Am I the only one who has always hated the Asha character in the books? I kind of like the actress because she fits how I feel about the character- she's a jerk! Why is she so damned pleased with herself all the time, and really, her sexual humiliation of Theon (who is admittedly a tool) is really uncalled for and just plain yucky. Ok. Taking a breath.
Really the whole Iron Islands plotline just slogged for me in the books and I am enjoying it much more on the show. There, I said it. Better than the books.  Theon - perfect. Balon - perfect. Pyke looks absolutely amazing, and I loved the whole segment. 
Stannis/Mel sex - this was always implied in the book, perfectly played.  Stannis is still so rigid and brittle, but human.  No reason not to show this, it gives Stannis' guilt an extra dimension when Renly dies.
559	Graufreude	2012-07-25	I haven't read the whole thread, so I don't know if somebody came up with this, yet.... but the scene that really struck me in this episode was the child of Craster being taken away by something...
...now what if that something was a CotF and Craster was actually a good guy? /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
560	Phat Walda	2012-09-03	I know I'm wicked late to this party, but my husband and I wanted to wait till we had finished book 2 before we started watching the second season. I'm starting to wonder if we should have even bothered, since it's looking a lot different already. I think he still would have been surprised by the second book at this rate. 
ROZ! What the fuck, man? Brendan already called it, and I bet he's right: Roz is going to be the one the Kettleblacks capture, thinking that she's Shae. It seems like anytime there's something for a side character, she gets shoehorned in. Writers, WE DON'T CARE. Her character has no depth, no backstory, and she's not that great an actress (she's not even actually crying in that scene, I mean, c'mon). 
JOFFREY! He's suddenly got a brain in his head, eh? They;re making both him and Cersei a lot smarter in the show than they are in the books. Not that I think that's a bad thing, but I wonder how it will affect the rest of the story. 
YARA! I actually liked her casting a lot. She's not classically beautiful, but she's got sex appeal, which I think is more important for someone who's supposed to be kind of a badass. I wish that they had kept in Theon spilling his guts to her about his family, I think that added to his humiliation, which I always enjoy. 
BALON! He was perfect. 'Nuff said. 
PYKE! God, it was SO PERFECT. 
STANNIS FUCKS MEL?! So fucking what if the TV audience was going to be confused? You think that I WASN'T confused when she's suddenly 9 months along after having been flat-stomached only a few days earlier? And yet GRRM felt no need to explain everything and ruin the mystery. That's half the fun! Oh, well. 
ANYWAYS. I think that this episode could have been a lot tighter and a lot better, and I didn't enjoy it half as much as the first one.
561	PetyrPunkinhead	2013-03-17	I'm re-watching S2 on Blu-Ray and thought I'd comment on each episode w/ their respective special features as I go. Yes, I know there's a general S2 blu-ray thread, but it's a long and unwieldy beast. I'm wondering what people think about each episode after a second viewing and w/ the added bonus of the commentaries, histories, maps, etc.The histories in this episode are again great. The episode has a bit less "oomph" for me on the second go-round after having read the books and knowing where Theon ends up this season. I also couldn't get through the commentary on this one. It's w/ the actors that play Theon and his sister Yara. They apparently are friends off screen and it made for a surprisingly tedious commentary track. I ended up turning it off about mid-way through the episode.
562	Ran	2012-04-08	How would you rate episode 202?
					
					
							Edited by Ran, 09 April 2012 - 04:01 AM.
563	DannySpud	2012-04-09	I'd rate episode 201 as a 7 or 8. Episode 202 on the other hand...
564	Laohu	2012-04-09	I gave it a 9. It would have received a 10 if D&D had refrained from putting the Ros/LF scene in. The only purpose I can see it having is a foreshadowing to Qyburn.
565	SFA-OK	2012-04-09	I gave it a 4. I'm almost done watching the show. I was hoping it would improve from last season but if anything, it's gotten worse. Unnecessary changes, changes for the worse, characters acting out of character from the book, etc. The writing is just mediocre, there's no way around it. It's clear they are targeting a mass audience (which is understandable) but the show and the writing definitely suffers. I just don't get some of the changes, though. Melisandre and Stannis? What the hell, And that's just the tip of the iceberg. 
And I'm starting to think the show's producers/writers are just looking for excuses to show nudity, lol. Not that I would normally complain, but, the semen scene, wow.
566	Qhorin Halfhand and Yoren	2012-04-09	6/10
They have some rather good scenes but the Dragonstone storyline and the portrayal of characters such as Stannis continues to be disappointing, Yara/Asha wasn't as good as I expected  and I found the Ros scene unnecessary. I thought the Theon sex scene also went too long and wasn't particularly good scene. Highlights are Balon/Theon scene, Tyrion and Janon Slynt and Tyrion and Cersei scene and Arya scenes. The episode is not bad, its good parts are pretty good, but judging it overall, it is not as good as I had hoped especially with how it handled Stannis.

The show has to be different from the books simply because of the limitations of the medium. And what's wrong with the Mel/Stannis scene? The books make it pretty clear that she has sex with him. And as far as nudity goes, IIRC every sex scene (except Ros') was either directly or indirectly in the books, and IIRC sex often involves nudity. (And IMO Ros is a good, necessary addition to the show but lets not get into that...)
568	Lord of Cheese	2012-04-09	I gave it a 9. The story telling has improved. Ghost looked cool!
-1 for Ros. Sick and tired of the brothel scenes. They waste so much time and contribute nothing to the story other than sexualising it. There is plenty of sex in the books without having to add more unnecessary stuff. They should let the books guide the content exclusively! There is plenty of story to show without wasting time on this pointless stuff.
Balon/Theon/Asha was well done i thought.
A litte bit slow on the Danny side fo things.

That's what makes you want to turn off? Not the excessive violence?
570	Ice Turtle	2012-04-09	6/10, the first one was better, I actually liked Ros scene. LF was rather scary

Not the excessive violence?They do? Because I sure as shit don't remember that, but I've only read the books one time so maybe I missed that part. But I always thought Stannis was a cold, non-sexual (almost impotent) character who was obsessed with being king and pretty much nothing else. The semen scene was just totally unnecessary and over the top, but that's just my two cents on it.
572	Fryie	2012-04-09	I actually disagree with the "Stannis is not changed" opinion.Of course, Stannis and Mel make little shadow babies, but we don't ever get to see how. In my head I always pictured Stannis doing it out of necessity, while in this episode he was at least partially driven by lust.That might just be my interpretation of Book Stannis and doesn't have to be the true one, but for me, it is a change.Now whether that change is good or bad, is another thing. For me, it's becoming a little boring, since basically, everyone is having sex at some point. [I hope they do not decide to add a Varys "and this is how you do it as a eunuch" scene...]
573	PatrickStormborn	2012-04-09	They do? Because I sure as shit don't remember that, but I've only read the books one time so maybe I missed that part. But I always thought Stannis was a cold, non-sexual (almost impotent) character who was obsessed with being king and pretty much nothing else.The semen scene was just totally unnecessary and over the top, but that's just my two cents on it. They have sex to produce shadowbabies; Melisandre says that her bed has seen little use after the departure of Stannis (long after they've stopped making shadowbabies); Jon recognises that Melisandre is his true queen. There's plenty of evidence for it.
574	TheEvilKing	2012-04-09	+ Tyrion's scenes with Cersei and Janos Slynt were both amazing.+ Pyke was awesome. Balon was spot on and Yara is an improvement over Asha.+ Jaqen seems perfect.+ Sallador Saan is great. "I don't want to rape her, I want to fuck her." Indeed.- No Joffrey. He was the best part of ep 1. Also no Robb who was also great.- No Renly, so he's only going to be in 2 eps this season, by the looks of it? Nobody will care when he dies.- They seem to be just throwing LF random crap scenes at this stage to give Aiden Gillan something to do. It's not working.- Mel promising Stannis a son. This doesn't jive with me. I'm fine with them fucking since it obviously happened in the books, but Stannis wanting to father a bastard boy makes zero sense.I'm giving it a solid 6.
575	salt	2012-04-09	Terrible Stannis scenes.  Stannis having sex with Mel, fine.  Grunting with ecstasy as he does it?  Not fine.  And the hopeful "A son!?" line...so un-Stannis like it made me cringe.
576	mrnegativity	2012-04-09	People are so harsh. Stannis was played pretty well in this ep, and they need to establish Melisandre-as-seductress and Stannis-as-devotee early on (otherwise a whole heap of later actions won't make any sense)... what better way than getting them to fuck on the table shaped like Westeros? Awesome. And Miss Van Houten got her gear off... people are still complaining why??8/10 for an awesome episode. There were a few wierd moments (Jon racing through the forest in detective mode) but the rest was suitably epic.Yet again art direction (costumes, set design) is UNREAL.

577	wyman's cook	2012-04-09	yup, the Stannis-Meli scene, could have been avoided..they should have made it way more subtle or at least avoid showing Stannis as lust-driven or seduced
also, no Balon bitchslaping Theon ? WTF ... they cut their whole scene's impact/climax
and why oh why the Jon-Craster incident ????

578	Debb2	2012-04-09	5 from me. 
I liked Tyrion's scene with Slynt, especially the relationship between Bronn and Tyrion. 
I also thought the scene with Little Finger in the brothel showed a side to him that's not normally seen. He works so hard to maintain a smooth, gentlemanly demeanour that it was "nice" to see a manipulative, cruel and threatening background. 
Also liked seeing Stannis show some human weakness; Jaqen (who I struggled to get an impression of at first when reading the book) and Gendry (who seems so believable).
But overall I felt the episode jumped around too much. The scene-setting and character introductions continued from episode 1. I'm struggling to care about Dany and Arya's situations too.
579	SFA-OK	2012-04-09	They have sex to produce shadowbabies; Melisandre says that her bed has seen little use after the departure of Stannis (long after they've stopped making shadowbabies); Jon recognises that Melisandre is his true queen. There's plenty of evidence for it.I had forgotten about that (there is so much stuff in the books), but TV Stannis is totally different so far than the book version and that scene, ugh. I didn't mind the nudity, though!
580	HyacinthGirl	2012-04-09	Loved it. As per usual. Posted all my thoughts in the discussion thread but I need to emphasise how much that extra Jon/Craster scene rocked. It was a great addition, possibly my favourite added scene so far.
Also, everything Arya was amazing, and Tyrion just keeps getting better and better. "I'm not questioning your honour, just denying its existence." Lad.
Please stop complaining about Stannis & Mel having sex. You all knew they did it, and the shadow baby sequence will make a bit more sense now.
Very sad Rakharro's dead, he was pretty. But it does remind the audience that Dany isn't just skipping through the sunny desert, she's in a lot of danger with enemies all around her.

581	a shadow	2012-04-09	Tyrion and Bronn, Tyrion and Cersei, Tyrion and Janos, anything involving Tyrion was stopping time.
Balon and Theon were locked in an amazingly intense scene too. 
And Gilly unknowingly touched the very heart of Sam by calling him "brave" /rofl2.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rofl:' />
Yoren deserves all the "braves" I can find. His character is being threated properly.
Hot Pie was amazing and excellent and flawless and (adjectives continue in the same manner). Dialog about battles was perfect and revealed each character on the spot. 
Salador/Davos/Davos' son were perfection too /rofl2.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rofl:' />
Was dissapointed that they gave so much time to Ros and such, while rushing Arya's trust for Gendry and making her to admit being a Stark to him.
Was not a fan of Joffrey ordering the killings. I almost expect for him to be dressed all in black soon, just to complete the cliche of a villain.
Stannis seems a little petty. 
Asha/Yara came across as not so much intelligent or daring (as in the books), but simply spiteful and a brute.
582	Dracarya	2012-04-09	I gave it a 9 - I'm trying to take the show as a separate entity to the books now, else I'd lose my mind. We don't see Stannis and Melisandre having sex in the books, so it's no surprise that people are shocked when it happens so blatantly on our screens. He has been changed - "a son?" was just cringe-worthy. Too many brothel scenes too - makes me feel slightly ill. No need to see all of that. 
Very close to giving up watching too, but seeing it as a new TV show rather than an adaptation of these books makes it a bit better. I thoroughly enjoyed season 1, probably because I watched it before reading.  I highly doubt we'll get all the seasons needed to cover all of the books anyway.
583	mrnegativity	2012-04-09	Too many brothel scenes?? GRRM vividly describes vaginas as 'c***s' in the books and happily writes about incest, but nudity and sex on screen 'makes you...ill'?
Kudos for remaining faithful to GRRM's violently sexual world, IMO.

585	TheEvilKing	2012-04-09	Based on the rest of your post your 9/10 score seems a tad strange.Haha yes. 9/10 but very close to giving up watching? So a TV shows need to be a perfect 10/10 to be watchable?

587	mrnegativity	2012-04-09	Adaptation =/= word for word rendering! The show is doing a pretty awesome job of making Westeros come alive.
But I'll stop trolling now.
588	DannySpud	2012-04-09	Like I said - taking it as a separate entity. 9/10 as a show, pretty damn crap as an adaptation of these excellent books.GRRM has said that he wrote the books almost specifically to be un-adaptable because he was fed up with the limits imposed by tv and film (paraphrasing a bit as I can't remember his exact words but that's the gist of it). I think they're doing a decent job with it.
589	PatrickStormborn	2012-04-09	The show is a faithful adaptation. Stannis and Mel is as obvious in the books as Loras and Renly, and I'm sure we would have got a very graphic sex scene if Mel had been a POV character while Stannis was still at the Wall.Asha/Yara came across as not so much intelligent or daring (as in the books), but simply spiteful and a brute.I've got to admit - I thought the exact opposite. I didn't like Asha at first in the books, but I think Yara seems more compelling and more in line with what we learn about her in AFFC.Too many brothel scenes?? GRRM vividly describes vaginas as 'c***s' in the books and happily writes about incest, but nudity and sex on screen 'makes you...ill'?Kudos for remaining faithful to GRRM's violently sexual world, IMO.Exactly. Readers have been describing GRRM's sex scenes as "gratuitous" since AGOT was first published. The show seems no different to me.

590	Princess of the Night	2012-04-09	I gave it a ten, because I think it was waaaaay better than the first one. I really liked it. 
Asha is not what I imagined her like, but I think the actress is perfect for the role. And Balon, too. Loved it.
There might be a little too much time for Ros and Littlefinger, but to people who never read the books, it means a lot to see the relationship between Littlefinger and Catelyn.. 
And as far as Joffrey ordering the bastard killings, well, whatever. Cersei's time is yet to come, let the audience hate Joffrey a bit more..
591	a shadow	2012-04-09	Like I said - taking it as a separate entity. 9/10 as a show, pretty damn crap as an adaptation of these excellent books.I'm getting a little better at separating books from the show too. It really helps. Still such a big difference compared to season one, when all was new to me. No regrets for reading the books though /fencing.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':fencing:' /> They are amazing /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
592	Tywin's bastard	2012-04-09	I thought the first episode worked well but this is still a clear step up, mainly because most things are on their way and the tempo could be lowered a bit. It's clear that the entire machine working on GoT knows better how to work now than last season, which I suspect will pay off immensely when things really get going.Pyke was amazing. This season has been a step up in production values overall and it made seeing the Iron Islands really joyful. The acting keeps on being done well and these characters will certainly add to the show in a great way.I actually liked the added scene with Ros and Littlefinger quite a bit since we get to see one of the most fundamental parts of him, which of course is his ruthless efficiency, and Aidan acted it very well by slowly going from one thing to another. He's not emotionally attached to many things in the world and it's both why he's so great at finances, as well as a good part of why his schemes are of the kind that can succeed.I don't have a problem with Stannis having sex with Melisandre either. It's a fact that it happens in the books and that he's aroused doesn't bother me. In the books we hear that he slept with his wife out of duty but she's a completely different person than Melisandre. I don't think the fact that Stannis can be aroused changes him (even most of the driest men can be in the right situation and Stannis doesn't have to be two-dimensional) and it's a clear way to show how Melisandre affects him and his decisions in a way that no one else can (which of course makes Davos' job very hard). As always, the number one rule in TV/film: Show, don't tell.Like I said - taking it as a separate entity. 9/10 as a show, pretty damn crap as an adaptation of these excellent books.Could you point me towards a TV show, or movie, that adapts something comparable with far greater faithfulness then? It must be out there since you go so very far as to describe this adaptation as "pretty damn crap", which I hope no one would do without learning how to make proper expectations. It would be interesting to see such an example in order to compare witht his show.

Certain characters are being changed for reasons beyond me, there is too much sex, and I think the icing on the cake was Arya instantly trusting Gendry.

The only thing ridiculous about it is you calling that obvious fact ridiculous when it gets used in practice. For people that don't want to discuss it's better to start a blog.Your post was a bit tricky to get a grip on so the reason for me asking about it (and it was an honest question) was to understand the contest you're coming from. In order to understand your point about how the show is as an adaptation it's interesting to know what you think adaptations are generally like.
596	salt	2012-04-09	So far, Robert is the only Baratheon brother to have been portrayed faithfully in the show.  Renly in almost a completely new character, from what we saw in season 1 he retained maybe 15 percent of the essence of the book character.  Stannis also seems to have been changed pretty drastically, though its still early on.  Which is fine, it doesn't ruin the show, but its disappointing for the readers like me who thought the Baratheon brothers and their dysfunctional relationship with one another was one of the best parts of the books.
Aside from Stannis and the confirmation that it was Joffrey and not Cersei who ordered the killings ( /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />), I liked the episode.  The Iron Islands were great, very faithful to the Theon chapter in the book.  I loved Gendry and Arya ("You shouldn't insult people who are bigger than you." "Then I'll never get to insult anyone!").  OK episode, but out of the 12 we've seen so far this falls somewhere in the bottom 4 for me.

Fuck me with a bloody spear, I didn't realise having a mixed opinion was a problem. I'm just incredibly surprised that so many people are shocked by the scene. How else did you think Mel got shadowbabies -- by having sex with Stannis while he slept? It's all but confirmed in the books, just like Loras and Renly (although, now that I think about it, Mel/Stannis is a bit more obvious). The reason they've had to show a sex scene between Mel and Stannis is because so many readers missed it. If the show simply hinted at it, I doubt many viewers would pick up on it.Gendry knew Arya was a girl; she therefore had to explain why she was with the Night's Watch. There is nothing wrong with "having a mixed opinion". I just don't understand how Game of Thrones could ever be called a bad adaptation. It's much more faithful to the books than I was expecting. Some things simply have to be changed.
598	a shadow	2012-04-09	OK episode, but out of the 12 we've seen so far this falls somewhere in the bottom 4 for me.Today I deliberately went on various entertainment sites and read comments there. It differs like day and night from people, who have read the books,and those, who didn't. Viewers who just watch the show are amazed how good the episode was...

I'm going to reserve judgement until I see how they've handled the Arya/Gendry relationship throughout the whole season.

I like sex scenes as much as the next man, but there comes a point were it becomes over the top and gratuitous.  As usual HBO has crossed that threshold.  But what do you expect from the channel that has brought you Six Feet Under, Rome and True Blood.2. Not only do I not like the actor for Stannis, but I also would rather have any sex between Stannis and Mel to remain implied rather than be explicit.  I almost stopped watching the show I was so shocked.3. Killing one of Dany's blood riders to save a buck?  Where was the sense in that?4.  Having Theon finger his sister is just creepy.  No way Asha/Yara would allow itIf HBO is just gonna get paid to rewrite ASOIAF what is the point?

I'm not expecting great episodes until the latter part of the season though. Honestly, I don't mind a few changes here and there. It's not because I didn't like how the books were written originally, I just don't think the changes are that big of a deal yet. Overall, I think the show is fantastic, even when considered as an adaption rather than a free standing entity. I'm sure George would agree. It's his world and even he's more relaxed about it than you guys are.

603	Slingingstones	2012-04-09	9
The difference between the two media is that video does not require you know how to read. (Except for the sub-titles when Dothraki is spoken.)
604	Loras	2012-04-09	I am going to give this episode an 8/10.  I thought that the episode was great with a number of excellent character building scenes but was still setting up the core of the season.
The Good:
			    I loved the subtle handling of some of the characters in this episode.  A particular stand out for me was building Samâ<U+0080><U+0099>s character.  He was a thinly drawn character in the first season, a sidekick for Jon Snow who gave him advice but here for the first time he gets an opportunity to shine.  I love what Jon Bradley does with the character and I enjoy the changes that D&D have made (particularly in reference to girls).  The moment that Gilly called Sam brave was one of those few heart warming episodes that reminds us that this world is very human.  I also challenge those people struggling with the adaptation to knock the way that Sam is portrayed.  A second example is the relationship between Davos and Stannis.  The scene where Davos and Matthos are discussing religion and gods is fantastic.  This small scene has done wonders for the entire Dragonstone storyline and I feel now as though I understand the respect that Davos has for his King.  Liam Cunningham is hitting it out of the park with the role of Davos! 
			    The entire Arya arc in this episode was a joy to watch unfolding on the screen.  At first I was concerned that there would be little payoff to the cliffhanger from â<U+0080><U+009C>The North Remembersâ<U+0080><U+009D>, but again this story was filled with nuance and all of the actors involved were brilliant.  The scene with Yoren and the Goldcloaks was also a touch of class and I look forward to seeing where this story will go from here.
			    Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing was stellar once again, Peter Dinklage continues to impress as Tyrion Lannister, I could rave about those scenes all day! 
			    The Brothel scene was a stroke of genius in my opinion.  The writers really show two things with this scene; the first is another window into the character of Petyr Baelish.  We know now how Petyr rose so high in court, he is ruthless and manipulative, it was good to see another facet of the character.  The second aspect showed how some of the common people feel about the way that the Gold Cloaks massacre of the bastards is affecting public opinion.  Much better that the previous Littlefinger-Ros scene.
			    The Bad:
			    I am missing Catelyn this season.  I noticed in the discussions of the previous episode that people were complaining that Ros has had more screentime than Dany? Well what about Catelyn?!  I am looking forward to catching up on her story soon.
			    Overall I feel that this episode continues to set up the rest of the seasonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s arc, but I thought that the montage at the end of â<U+0080><U+009C>The North Remembersâ<U+0080><U+009D> would kickstart the season in a similar way to the final scene of â<U+0080><U+009C>Cripples, Bastards and Broken Thingsâ<U+0080><U+009D>, but I was wrong.  This was a slower episode that builds up the fantastic characters of the series, adding more layers to each of them.  The end of the episode fell flat for me, but I am looking forward to seeing where we go from here...!
605	rmholt	2012-04-09	I liked the Asha/Theon scene and wordplay.  Why did they rename her?  And she appears so different than described/  
too soft, no beak.  The sex stuuf between them was at least relatively faithful to the book.  
The Stannis/Mel sex was a little over the top - why on the Painted Table in a rush of passion, rather than in a private room with a rush of duty.  
LF is getting too much screen time and is carrying too much of the narration of the story.  I wonder why they are relatively good at conveying the nature of characters more subtly but LF has to be spelled out.
Agree Arya, Gendry, Hot Pie, Lommy well done.  "that;s not very lady like"
EXTREMELY glad they are using Dolorous Edd.
I'm having trouble understanding some of the lines - maybe need to activate CC.
Also the girl on girl sex scenes are excessive in number and detail and gratuitous. To me.
606	End of Disc One	2012-04-09	The Stannis/Mel sex was a little over the top - why on the Painted Table in a rush of passion, rather than in a private room with a rush of duty.  I've seen quite a few people say this.  But how do you even get it up when you're only doing it for duty?
607	Lany Cassandra	2012-04-09	I gave it a 6, the lowest rating I have given any episode.  I didn't care about all the minor changes as long as they keep the major plot lines in place, and I am worried they messed up two of them.
The husband on the other hand (non-book reader) still gives it an 8 or 9.  He didn't like the Ros crying scene, but loved most everything else.
608	Mr. E	2012-04-09	I've seen quite a few people say this.  But how do you even get it up when you're only doing it for duty?The Lord of Light has many abilities some would consider to be...unnatural.Oh, gave it an eight, for what it's worth.

609	Greywolf2375	2012-04-09	I've seen quite a few people say this.  But how do you even get it up when you're only doing it for duty?It's very similar to trying to get pregnant for a long time - basing the act on time of day, day of month, etc.  It takes the fun out of it and makes it work/duty.  That is what Stannis should have looked like - not "I can finally have a SON?!?!" and jump on her.  A bastard son as well.
610	Ser Graymax	2012-04-09	Gave it an 8.
First 2 episodes down, so far so good.  Rather than comment on the storylines Im going to address the new/newer characters.
New casting is not what Id pictured but so far all seem to be doing a good job.
Milisandre - Should have been more exotic, sexy, flirtatious.
Davos - Excellent
Theons sister, Yara - Pictured her as slimmer, more athletic, prettier even with a strong nose.
Balon Grayjoy - Suitably creepy, could have played Walden Frey if older.
Craster - Too clean, intelligent, unthreatening.
Gilly - Acceptable
Captains Daughter - Great fit to the book.
Stannis - Spot on but I just dont like the actor.
Jagen H'ghar - Good, need to see more.
Salladhor Saan - Mixed feelings, I like his dialogue but not his delivery.
Gendry - Just perfect.
For the first time last night Cersei actually looked attractive.  (Must be the cheekbones) She was just too drawn in the face before and those wigs suck.

611	Robin Of House Hill	2012-04-09	I gave it a 7.  I was feeling generous because the scenery at Pike was done wonderfully.  Otherwise, it played like a soap opera.  The scenes with Davos were excellent.  The LF/Roz scene was worthless.  Otherwise, too much was changed from the book, in the interest of getting to the "good stuff" sooner within a 10 episode season.  Maybe I was too generous.
612	Blisscraft	2012-04-09	The show brought me to the books.  For that, I will always be extremely grateful.  That being said, I am a bit nonplussed by the bit with Jon following Craster.  Wha?!?!?  Really?  I don't know what that will accomplish.  Someone please explain it to me.  Gently, though. . . /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />
Continue to love Arya, Gendry, and Sam.  Fantastic!  Looking forward to more Davos, Edd, and Balon Greyjoy.
613	episodenone	2012-04-09	I wish I could have liked it as much as the rest of you.  Just talked about it with a buddy of mine and he agreed with my point of view.
I gave it a 4.  I know, I know it was meant to be a build the plot -- but I was rather bored in the meantime.  The scene with Ros and LF seemed to go on for 15 minutes - as did the scene with Dany's bloodrider -- neither or which held any value to me.
Maybe if I had not read the books I woul dneed those scenes -- but can't see why.
My fear is that they really will veer off from the book - as, for example, the seeming importance of Gendry - when he is basically lost as far as I can tell in the novels.  Might as well not spend as much time on it on TV.
I do seem to be in the minority here - but I have always been a tough sell.  Then again - I also think the novels are tediously long at times with a heck of a lot of filler that is unneeded - so maybe that is what they are doing here as well.
Don't get me wrong [since I am new to these boards] - I do love the story - just don't love the execution entirely.
614	Tears of Lys	2012-04-09	I gave it a 6, the lowest rating I have given any episode.  I didn't care about all the minor changes as long as they keep the major plot lines in place, and I am worried they messed up two of them.The husband on the other hand (non-book reader) still gives it an 8 or 9.  He didn't like the Ros crying scene, but loved most everything else.Yeah, I gave it a 6 too.  I was extremely disappointed in Asha/Yara.  No humor or devil-may-care at all.  Just a flat character.  And has anyone discovered why they decided to change her name?  Did it sound too similar to Arya or something?  And "Yara" doesn't?  :totally confused:I get where they're going with having so much emphasis on the brothels/Ros, etc.  there's a lot of things that are hinted at in the books that can be made clear through these scenes.  And it gives the show a chance for more NUDITY!  Yay!  /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />Pike was really great looking.  Balon... not so much.  Why do all these old, grizzled characters show up looking so good?  I imagined Yoren, for example, to be a lot more skanked out looking.  That reminds me, have we seen old Frye yet?  If he shows up looking under 90, I'm going to kick the TV.
615	Mr. E	2012-04-09	The show brought me to the books.  For that, I will always be extremely grateful.  That being said, I am a bit nonplussed by the bit with Jon following Craster.  Wha?!?!?  Really?  I don't know what that will accomplish.  Someone please explain it to me.  Gently, though. . . /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />I thought that scene was the best in the show--but as to your question: I think it just came down to the producers wanting a way to get across the horrific means Craster has of keeping his lands while reminding the watching audience of the actual presence of the WW, which is something that has not been seen since the first part of the first episode of the first season.
616	WinterWarrior	2012-04-09	I love the show in general, but this episode only rated a 4 with me, when last week I rated episode 1 a 10. I am so sick and tired of Ros and the brothel and feel those scenes are such a waste of time that could have been better spent on extending and developing other scenes like the ones with Asha/Theon going up to Pyke, more with Arya, show as much Tyrion as possible please, and Dany's three blood riders came back to her - one did not die. Why was that necessary?
The best part was Ghost. I thought the ending was mixed up as well and did not make much sense, with Jon and Craster....
617	boojam	2012-04-09	I refuse to give the show anything but 10 because of production values and the cast.
That said it's like the 201. Are D&D afraid there won't be a S3? Even knowing it's not true, almost seems as if they are trying to shoe horn all of CoK into one season. Don't mind the deviations, but have to watch a episode at least 3 times to catch what happened. Keep hoping things will slow down. Hate to say it, because D&D are such fine writers, but almost seems as they were overworked , and from what they say seems they are. The first season was the product of work that went on for three years from 2007 to 2010. Now I am sure D&D spent time on S2 before S1 started filming, in fact I think they have said they blocked out the teleplays as far as they could. But when push comes to shove, it seems picking and preparing Dubrovnik and Iceland took place in 2011, so that seems a lot of work. Well Bryan Cogman and Vanessa Taylor wrote the next two episodes, hopefully they had more time to mull (yes I know D&D had the final input).
A whole lot happens on the road with Gendry and Arya, thought they summarized that quite well. Tom Wlaschiha finally on stage and says something, brief! I even thought in the book once Jaqen H'ghar had his appearance George would give more elaboration, but that does not come until later, and even then seems slim, H'ghar is supposed to be mysterious but knowing , now, the rest of the FM story, he's as opaque as welders goggles.

618	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-09	I rated it a solid 9.  I'm not yet comfortable with some of the changes they are making with the books, but I thought as a show it was fantastic.  I connected with many of the characters and arcs.  I loved the scenery and the costumes.  The only major costume issue I have is Cersei's horrible hair.  It looks so incredibly fake that it's distracting.  The least they could have done to make it somewhat believable was to dye her eyebrows a shade lighter. 
My favorite scene was the fish pie conversation with Shae, Varys, and Tyrion.  I cringed and I laughed.  Dolorous Edd also had me laughing my arse off.
619	The Anti-Targ	2012-04-09	7 from me, almost a 6. I thought the episode was going quite well, and then that abomination of a final scene.
Still don't see much subtlety in Melisandre's character.
620	eyeheartsansa	2012-04-09	Enjoying the season so far.. I don't really have any complaints, other than..I was really looking forward to meeting Asha/Yara, it was one of the funniest things in the book.  I would have liked to see her mess with Theon a bit more before revealing herself.  But it's small potatoes, there is so much ground to cover I can't really blame them.To me it just doesn't do to get hung up over changes from the book.  It is an HBO series.. and much more enjoyable if you try to watch it as a TV series, and not a strict adaptation.  I enjoy the things they change up, because I like being surprised.  if everything was 100% faithful to the book it would get boring.
621	boojam	2012-04-09	And has anyone discovered why they decided to change her name?  Did it sound too similar to Arya or something?  And "Yara" doesn't?  :totally confused:Well that question has been hang fire for a year now. As far as I know it's never been directly posed to D&D.Did they make the change or was it at HBO's request? Still does not make a lot of sense.Gemma Whelan is ok by me, tho why they have chosen to homley-fie her, well a little, is a bit of a mystery.Gemma is not Catherine Deneuve, but have seen Gemma in other productions and seems her appearance could have fit George's better. Supposedly she and Alfie auditioned together so well D&D thought they had to get her. Indeed in E2 they did play off each other well...(again so brief!), but they skipped the Shakespearean mistaken identity 'horse' play that was so effective in the book. Make's one wish they did a 'director's' cut of the episode!
622	Dacie	2012-04-09	9/10.  Really liked it!
623	Ferrum Aeternum	2012-04-09	I gave it a 9/10, better than last week imo.  I didn't mind any of the changes.
624	A Redeemed Hound	2012-04-09	I gave it a 5.  Last week was way better.  Stop with the stupid-ass brothel scenes.  We get it.  People have sex there.  They are cheapening the story and the books and everything we love.  I can live with most of the changes but I do not want to watch porn all night.  I want more story.  The cum on the woman's lip?  What is the point?  Theon's scene I can live with.  It was actually in the book and it kind of goes over how arrogant and dick-ish.  Stannis and Mel having sex?  I don't know.  I can go with that I guess.  I just think Stannis was terribly miscast.  The guy playing The Onion Knight should have played Stannis.  But he is also excellent as Davos so what can you do?
I love certain scenes too.  Arya's scenes rock.  I love the guy playing Jaquen.  I man has a thirst.  Loved that scene.  Loved Ghost.  I like who they cast as Gilly.  Love Sam.  I can live with the baby boy scene.  Have to give the audience something to chew on.  Love all things with Cersie and Tyrion and Tyrion and Janos.  ANd Tyrion and The Spider.
So much to love here but they completely ruin it with the stupid Littlefinger garbage.  So stupid.  I can even live with what happened to Rakharo.
I hope next week picks it up and gets the ball going.  If HBO only gives you 10 episodes they should have at least said they could have a 2-hour premier to get the story set up properly.  But last night was a 5 overall.  Some scenes were a 10.  Others a solid 1.
625	DornishSnake	2012-04-09	I understand the problems people are having with the show, but 4 seems excessively low. The show has to be different from the books simply because of the limitations of the medium. And what's wrong with the Mel/Stannis scene? The books make it pretty clear that she has sex with him. And as far as nudity goes, IIRC every sex scene (except Ros') was either directly or indirectly in the books, and IIRC sex often involves nudity. (And IMO Ros is a good, necessary addition to the show but lets not get into that...)What's wrong with the Stannis scene? Well, let's see.  His entire character is based on him being this slave to duty and virtue, and in one of our first scenes with him he's an oathbreaker to his wife, cheating on her because she's "sick." Remember when John Edwards did that? Really screams a persons of honour and duty.Second - how he did it. A spur of the moment decision. Again, simply screams Stannis. And worse, a spur of the moment decision clearly driven by temptation, selfishness, and -- if I'm being GENEROUS -- a bloodlust for power (giving him "an heir.").Who is this character???So, regardless -- even if Stannis had sex is the book with her, it wouldn't have been anything like this.  Couldn't have been.But third and most important, the book is NOT clear that they had sex at all. You wonder. You consider. You debate with your friends. There's some mysetery there.**There is NO mystery in the HBO series, ever.** Everything is constantly being smashed over your head, like the viewers are idiots.This excuse about "medium" differences is also getting old. There have been great, multi-deminsional, suspenseful, complicated plots AND characters in TV. Battlestar Gallactica: Bill Adama and basically every character on the show. Most characters from LOST. Deadwood, The Wire.Game of Thrones the TV show and its characters don't stand up to any of those shows. In a story that was based on mystery and complicated characters, every bit of mystery and every complicated part of a character is being systematically removed. There was NO reason for that Stannis scene. Had NOTHING to do with "medium changes." The only reason it's in there is because HBO thinks it would get higher ratings if Stannis has hot, passionate sex scenes with a hot wizard, rather than if he didn't. The fact that Stannis the character would never have a hot sex scene -- and certainly not on the "spur of the moment" -- doesn't matter. This character is NOT Stannis, and HBO doesn't care.Last... the dialogue. Why is there so much of it? Non-stop chatter.  Where is a bit of silence, where it's just the camera and a character? Where their face shows what they're thinking, or better yet.. you wonder what they're thinking? In the Cersei and Tyrion scenes, those great actors have the good sense to at least pause in between sentences. In the others, it's just rapid fire, back and forth, endlessly, for the hour. I don't blame them. The writers have given the task of conveying everything by words, nothing by facial expressions or emotion.Is there ever going to be a scene that can compare with Bill Adama crying alone in his quarters? A scene that can compare with any of the LOST characters having a moment to themselves, where you don't know what they're thinking but want more than ever to find out?  Will HBO ever give us a scene like that? Like heck they will. Even though George gave them a raod-map to many scenes like that, and better, in the books.And don't tell me there's too much story to get through. There is also no rule that HBO had to do an entire book in one season. They could've developed the plot far more than they have. Look how slowly LOST was developed. Look how slowly GEORGE developed THIS story in the books! The books aren't thousands of pages for George's good health. They are thousands of pages because ALL good stories, especially this one, must be told at a certain pace.Here? Here Theon is tasked to go to his father's to get reinforcements and is there 5 minutes later, with his answer in hand. 0 suspense was able to build in that time. An outrage. The HBO show feels like point form notes, where getting through the plot is more a mechanical chore for the writers than a joy. And the audience can feel it.The first book alone could have, and perhaps should have, taken several TV seasons. Instead, HBO handcuffs themselves by trying to tell a 1,000 page book in 10 episodes, then complains they have to tell the story poorly because they were handcuffed. It's their own fault they're handcuffed, how can it be an excuse! Why do people buy that excuse?Frankly, I was embarassed by this episode. I haven't liked the HBO series at all so far. But this episode I didn't know what I story was watching, and didn't like it. An emabarassing disaster. If I'd never read the books, this is the type of story I would've laughed at. So simple, NO subtely whatsover. Even, dare I say, PREDICTABLE each and every time they stray from George's plot. Oh, let me guess: the hot female wizard gets a sex scene with the King.The execution of the story is brutal; and apart from the Imp and the Queen, all other characters have been dumbed-down so much, that they are no longer interesting. Stannis practically got a labotomy. What a tragedy. And this is just the beginning.

626	lyvyathan	2012-04-09	I'll give it a 9/10. Why, because when the credits rolled I was still awestruck.
OK, so they dicked around with the GRRM's story - but we saw that coming in Season 1 when Renly and the Knight of Flowers were transformed into a Freddie Mercury that couldn't sing and a Leonardo Dicaprio who couldn't act.
One of the many things that stood out for me - and I'm not talking about Stannis's organ.
1. Theon Greyjoy's scene with Asha and his father - I thought that was pretty riverting acting coming from all three.  Best of all, you could feel the Ironborn culture oozing out from the contempt of (the actor playing) Baleon. Wow.
2. Asha/Yara - I really really like the actress who plays the character - she carries it with a subtle swagger. I like it.
As in 201, I could have done without another brothel scene - it was a new development unnecessary to the storyplot and it wasted time which could have been devoted elsewhere imho.
I don't mind additions - I absolutely loved the added conversation between Cersei and Robert about Dany's threat in Season1 and the humorous remark about how their marriage was holding up the Kingdom. But this LF twaddle? It detracts from the overall story imho.
3. Peter Dinklage was absolutely brilliant - again.
4. Davos and Saan - brilliant acting there too. I loved how Saan told off Davos' son.
Its not often that when the credits roll I'm awestruck - so I rate it 9/10.
Acting 4 + Props/Dress 4 + 1 point for HBO for the balls to produce this epic instead of a reality TV show or a butchered cheap version. So all up 9.

627	ServantOnIce	2012-04-09	I give it a "1" it was the worst episode of the 12 they have aired so far.
1. The Sex scenes, the scenes that feature Stannis/Mel and Captain's Daughter/Theon are necessary. Me, I don't like sex scenes so I turn the channel.  The one I missed (thank goodness) in the brothel I heard was disgusting and unnecessary as the brothel scene last year was. 
2. I loved the ending with Jon and Craster, we get to see a boy being offered to a White Walker/Other that was a heart pounding scene. Ghost would have been there, don't know why he wasn't.
3. I thought they should have left in Balon slapping Theon and mentioning Urron Redhand . . /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> The actress who played Asha/Yara looks nothing like we picture her but is good for the role.
4. Stannis and Mel need more time on camera, explaining who he is and what she is about . . but I know that isn't practical.
5. The guy playing Davos is so on point, and so money he's money and doesn't even know it. S. Saan was good as well, good conversation sounds S. Saan reminds me of a few of my relatives.
6. The Yoren scenes are on the money.
7. Queen of Mean Cersei is too soft . . . but there is time for that to change and I think it will.
Overall their worst episode of the 12 aired, but the potentional is high. I actually miss Catelyn Tully and next episode she will have a better role.
My one issue WHY KILL OF RAKKAHRO (sp?) that was FOOLISH!!
628	Seed	2012-04-09	I thought the episode came off pretty good.  I loved the portrayal of Sallahdor Saan and his relationship with Davos.  Also, the Hot Pie/Lommy/Arya conversation was a good add, I especially thought Hot Pie did a good job.  I'm liking the TV show Gendry more than the book Gendry, he's seems a bit more human.  I don't think I like book Gendry until far later on, but I took an immediate liking to him here.  The Tyrion/Slynt scene was great, I'm pretty sure they made Bronn head of the City Watch so as not to introduce yet another character in Bywater.  I also liked the LF scene as it established a more sinister man by words rather than by action. 
Yoren, FTW.
629	Thorny Issues	2012-04-09	Me, I don't like sex scenes so I turn the channel.  The one I missed (thank goodness) in the brothel I heard was disgusting and unnecessary as the brothel scene last year was.Genuine question: do you skip the (numerous) sex scenes in the books?
630	Seed	2012-04-09	OH YEAH and they killed off Rhakkaro!!!  That I didn't see coming, or expect.  Guess we shoulda seen that coming from their interaction in last week's episode.
631	Chelly	2012-04-09	I gave it a 9/10. I really liked it and I thought it was better than the last episode. I'm very excited to see how Theon is handled and I want more Jaqen already.
632	bloodymime	2012-04-09	Eight out of ten. First Ros scene i didn't dislike. The voyeurism is a good way to hammer home that this is the game of thrones, there's always somebody watching and most like someone is watching the watcher as well. Plus nothing says creepy like delivering that kind of threat in such a comforting tone.
Night's watch was great, Lommy already wanting to yield. Ha. Biter wasn't what you'd want to see but oh well.
Stannis has been a letdown from the start when he's  writing his letter of declaration and comes off to me as someone discussing what to have for breakfast, i understand the limitations of casting but he is an actor. Let's see a little more grinding of the teeth and clenching of the jaw. I've gotten used to it though as just about every single fighter in the series has come across as baked out hippies to me instead of warriors and hard men.
Jon and Caster was interesting. I don't mind the changes. I've read the books and like being left wondering a little what will happen next.
Pyke was awesome. Good ratings for that alone. Always liked the ironmen and hopefully they introduce Cleftjaw in the series and do him justice.
633	Giskard Reventlov	2012-04-09	Gave it 7 because I love the books, would've been lower.
Asha/Yara is TERRIBLY casted. Where did they find that fat girl with baby , plump face. I hoped that promo pics ere wrong but , alas.. As the stupid name change wasn't enough.
There were some good and bad casting choices on the show. i.e Meliasndre was also casted poorly but compared with this ungodly abomination she looks almost good.
Thing I hate most wih book adaptations is NOT when they omit or add parts but when they change nature of characters by changing the parts of the book (like in LOTR)
In season 1 they used those little changes to show us something about the character that is in the book but what could not be put in a show.
However I don't know to what end is all this Melisnadre/Stanis ; cercei/Littlefinger ; Tyrion/Spider.... scenes So far I dont see what does this changes add to the story.
p.s. I hope, at least, that they make another change and kill that terrible asha/yara so I dont have to look at her fat face anymore.
634	Reposado	2012-04-09	I liked this week a lot better than last week. People will complain about the unnecessary sex scene but the Dragonstone stuff was handled much better this week, and Theon and Arya both went on nice journeys, establishing the Iron Islands as a setting and a culture, and introducing us to the messiness that will become the riverlands. For now, I think they did a nice job with Gendry, and Lommy, and Hot Pie has been fantastic.
And of course Saan, very well done there

635	Greyjoy Rebellion	2012-04-09	DornishSnakes' post summed it up as well as anyone could, in regards to Stannis (I liked the show up to this point very much).
2/10.
636	_Oberyn_	2012-04-09	6. and 5 of that is just for Pyke. The rest was mediocre at best. Balon/Theon reunion dialogue should have remained faithfull to the book. Tyrion/Slyn the lines felt rushed. Salador gets a pass for now.
Edit- Great post DornishSnake
					
					
							Edited by _Oberyn_, 09 April 2012 - 12:12 PM.
637	Golden Brown	2012-04-09	Gave it a 7. I didn`t mind the sex scene between Stannis and Melissandre, but "I will give you a son" was stupid beyond anything. Stannis wouldn`t want to make a bastard. And I don`t like the fact that we will see Renly in the third episode, since he is already out of the picture by the end of the fourth.
638	Caro99	2012-04-09	i'd have to give it an 8. some parts were really funny and well acted, but that's certainly isn't how i pictured arya... and too much ros & LF again, and no Sansa or Sandor /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' /> but it was pretty good otherwise. i guess that with 20 or more main characters we won't always get what we want in each episode /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />
639	TeamDanyArya	2012-04-09	I'm going to try and post this again since the website crashed on me before I posted. /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />
Anyway, I gave it a 7. I think they rushed Theon's homecoming just a bit too much. I wanted a bit more tension there or the scene to be a bit longer. My husband was disappointed at how homely Asha, excuse me Yara, was. We were both expecting a bit more of a hottie but I'm more interested in the character as a whole. I pointed out that Greyjoys didn't strike me as particularly good-looking in the book so...
I could do without any more scenes in LF's brothel. I did actually like Ros this week since she got to be more human. And it showed LF as a wannabe Maifa boss. They could have done without the whole LF watching a dude watching Ros. Just LF watching Ros would have been okay. And I could have done without the mouth-wiping.
I think my favorite scenes were Tyrion with Cersei and Tyrion with Varys. You see just how much Cersei hates Tyrion and always and how much that hurts him even though he tried to not show that her. Varys and Tyrion are intersting together because it shows how Varys is truly looking out for the realm. LF and him have that conversation back in season 1 about how they both are only looking out for the realm but this season and in the books as well, you are shown that LF really is only looking out for himself and how to acquire more power. Varys isn't about acquiring power for himself necessarily.
Arya and Gendry was good. I like Gendry because he just wants to be left alone to be a blacksmith. If he ever found out about who his father is, I don't think he'd care. He certainly wouldn't make a play for the throne.
Ghost looked awesome. I want the direwolves in action, though. I want to see Grey Wind in battle with Robb. And Ghost and Jon need to be seen more together. Jon's scene was a little rough for me. Him running through the woods was off and I can't remember if it was in the book or not. ACOK was the one book I can't remember much about.
Mel and Stannis was fine for me. I didn't mind their sex scene since it is implied by Davos and Jon that Mel and Stannis got it on. I think the casting of Stannis is growing on me. He's awkward in the book and I think the actor is doing a good job of that. I think the line about giving him a son was put in there because it doesn't seem like they will be having Shireen in the show.
640	Tadco26	2012-04-09	My least favorite episode so far.
It started well with Arya, though I thought she was more provoking than defensive with her stick on Rorge. The books have Biter lurch thru the bars and try to grab her which prompts her to hit him with her stick. In the show it comes more like a kid poking at a barking dog in a cage. Not a big deal, but not as good a scene as it could have been. I liked Yorenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s interaction with the Gold Cloaks, though originally the came with they Queenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s orders. The second Arya scene didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t sit as well with me how ever. Gendry doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t figure out she is a girl nor does she share her true identity until after Yorenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death, and doing it before hand felt a bit forced. The acting was good, but it would have been more natural if it played out in the original time line instead of so soon. Even one more episode delay would have been worth while.
Tyrion, Shae and Varys scene is very good overall. I am still puzzled at Tyrion keeping Shae in the Tower of the Hand though. A big part of his problems at court are keeping Shae secret, NOT being willing to take her inside the castle and having to sneak out to see her. It also pretty much eliminates the idea that maybe Ros will be Alaya or Chataya as there is no need for the character if Shae isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t being kept in hiding in the first place. Maybe she will in the future, but itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to believe that all the spies in Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know about Shae by then. But beyond that point, the scene was well acted and I enjoyed it. Great considering I disliked season 1 Shae.
The council meeting where Cersei tears up Robâ<U+0080><U+0099>s offer went fine. Nothing particularly bad or good. Tyrion and Janos Slyntâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scene played out well, and I didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t mind Bronn being named captain of the city watch. I hate Joffrey ordering the killing of Robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bastards instead of Cersei. And Tyrion implying that she was worried the bastards might have a claim as the reason she wanted them killed was also silly. Two Hands had already figured out Cersei and Jamieâ<U+0080><U+0099>s secret based in large part from seeing these bastards, and the danger was even higher after Stannis sent the letters making the story public rumor. Joffrey would have been much more likely to kill anyone who spread the â<U+0080><U+009C>liesâ<U+0080><U+009D> than to kill Robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bastards, as he believed himself to be Robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s son.
Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s keep, Dolorous Eddâ<U+0080><U+0099>s fart joke fell flat for me. Otherwise the rest was well done for the first part. I liked Ghost, and Sam and Gilly. They didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need Jon to follow Craster to show what happened to the babies as they are not constrained by point of view characters, and if Craster cared enough to attack Jon, it seems unlikely he would have left him alive. All of the veteran rangers already knew what Craster did with his sons anyway.
Off to Dany, we get the death of Rakharo. Unfortunate, but understandable since the actor got a movie offer. That being said it wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t the only option, as they did recast Ser Gregor. The change didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t bother me, but I didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t feel any emotional impact from the death either.
Theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s sea voyage played out very close to the books, and was one of the more natural feeling â<U+0080><U+009C>sexpostionâ<U+0080><U+009D> scenes with the Captainâ<U+0080><U+0099>s daughter. Yara didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t match my image at all, but could be forgiven with more screen time. In the books she plays along with his flirtations, but tells him she is married and keeps his hands from wandering too much. In the show Theon sticks his hand down the front of her pants without her protesting at all. Balon did well in his scenes, and we shall see where things go from here.
Surprisingly I had almost no problem with Littlefingerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s brothel scene. It was a bit long, and the voyeur part easily could have been cut for more important scenes that were cut short. In the end that has always been my biggest problem with most of Rosâ<U+0080><U+0099> scenes, that so many lines and scenes have to be cut due to time constraints, but they make so much time for her scenes. But this scene was easily the best of her scenes for me, and also the one that most fit something I can imagine the book Littlefinger saying. So despite my general distain for Ros, this scene worked for me on itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s own even if I question if there wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t more interesting and important content to cover.
Likewise with Stannis and Melisandre, it didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t bother me even if I canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t say I thought it was a great scene by any stretch. Davos and Salladhor Saan played out pretty well, though Davos did worship the Seven even if he wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a particularly religious man, and my impression was that prior to recently his son would have worshiped them too. So back when Davos was a smuggler and Matthos was young praying for his fatherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s return it seems unlikely he would have been a follower of the Lord of Light at that time for that to be a good reason for why Davos should follow him. A minor point though and overall I liked the scene.
The most disappointing thing is that most of my complaints are not things that would require a bigger budget or significantly more time, but just writing issues that seem to be things that just as easily could have been written more true to the books.
641	teemo	2012-04-09	I agree, and that goes for Mel and Dani, too.  Especially, Dani, actually.  As beautiful as Emilia Clarke is, sometimes that wig makes her look like a Treasure Troll doll, with the contrast of brown eyes and that "silver-blonde"(baloney, that thing's white!) wig.I showed that to my good friend/hair girl because of how many people have told me I look like her, and she immediately said - "wow, look at that silver hair.  weird."
642	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-04-09	I've never been buggered by the wigs.
I felt the 2nd episode flowed much more nicely than the first.
All the Tyrion scenes were brilliant.
Bronn as Commander of Gold Watch suits me just fine.
Cersei is amazing in her coldness.
Pyke was fantastic, as are the Iron Born.
Arya and Gendry play off each other well, Jaqen was okay, Rorge and Biter really disappointed me.
Stannis's scene surprised me, but it was hinted at in the books, and my gods Mel has me wanting to convert!
Davos is awesome yet he seems more highborn then he should.
Saan should have been a bit more colourful, so although he is from Lys is he an immigrant from the Summer Isles?  I'll assume this for Xaro as well.
Daeny's scene was succinct.
I like Jon's ending, it is good to have read the books but to still be surprised.
Petyr/Ros...  I suppose it serves to enlighten us into how much of a cunt he is.  I wasn't impressed with Ros's acting though.
I'm happy to have voted an 8, I feel it was well deserved and the show will only get better from now on.
643	Slingingstones	2012-04-09	Yara/Asha's look is what I expected of a strong female sea captain, nine years before the mast,  commanding a tough crew and having killed men in close combat.  It tends to mess up one's mascara and lipstick.  bathing in salt water toughens your hide and frizzes your curls; and, beneath all that a body to arouse a long lost brother.  It really doesn't say much for Theon, who would screw a snake if someone would hold it's head...or better yet, screw a pile of rocks if he thought a snake was hiding therein.
644	Ravenhair	2012-04-09	I ranked the episode a 5.  Here's my explanation from the Ep 202 discussion thread with a few additions:
1. Asha was irritating as a character in the books when she was first introduced, IMO, but I grew to like her as the series progressed. The actress cast as Asha did not display her fire or spirit. 
2. Too bad it was sunny when the Pyke scenes were filmed. I always pictured Pyke as being perpetually overcast and, well, grey. 
3. Ok, we know that Stannis and Mel eventually have sex of some sort in the books because of the shadow babies. The scene tonight was just weird, though, and not a good weird. The actor portraying Stannis and the writers/directors do nothing to set up the idea that Stannis is shown, initially, to be so brittle that he will break before he bends. We do not get a sense at all of his unyielding moral compass, which helps show us later his total hypocrisy in the situation with Melisandre.
4. First the silver and now Rakharo?! Wtf, writers/directors? I understand the rakharo actor was offered another role, but then the show could have done something different than make him a bizarre plot point. 
5. Why is Sam suddenly a horn dog constantly thinking about and looking at women? Writers/directors, wtf?
6. Littlefinger has now been written to be creepy as shit without book littlefinger's intelligence. So instead of a great game player who is creepy, we get a dip shit who is creepy. 
7. Loved Arya (Maisie Williams) and Gendry (Joe Dempsie).  Close to the book scenes and great interaction between the two. Their scene was the highlight of the episode. Jaqen was excellent for the small time we saw him. Yoren (Francis Magee) was excellent last season and this season as well.  Conleith Hill as Varys was amazing as always.
645	boojam	2012-04-09	You know just like last week watching 202 again, like 201, I liked it better.
The drama at Pyke looked better the 2nd time around.
The very short sequence with Arya and Jaqen H'ghar looked good the first time... now watching it again, notice Jaqen apologizing for Rorge and Biter... I think that in the book?
Then as Arya dusts it up with Rorge and Biter notice the way Tom smiles at her defiance. Nice touch.
Did anyone catch what Melisandre meant when she said she would give Stannis a son?, ... that she meant a 'son' ... non book readers will find out.

646	boojam	2012-04-09	I showed that to my good friend/hair girl because of how many people have told me I look like her, and she immediately said - "wow, look at that silver hair.  weird."This WIG thing keeps bugging some people, I don't see it, the wigs look perfect to me.
647	teemo	2012-04-09	This WIG thing keeps bugging some people, I don't see it, the wigs look perfect to me.Yeah, it's definitely silver....I even got it "silver-approved" by someone that does hair colouring for a living! hah. All the wigs look fine.  She wasn't even 100% positive that it was a wig (it was a small-ish picture on my phone), but was fairly confident that it was.

648	Lord Godric	2012-04-09	A solid nine.  This episode was great, and it fabulously managed to build on the foundation that the first episode built.  The Greyjoy scenes, the Arya/Gendry scenes, the Davos scenes all were executed excellently.
649	Howdyphillip	2012-04-09	I am shocked at how many people are rating this thing 5 and below. To me, a 5 would be an average episode on American television. Something like a run of the mill episode of CSI Whatever the Fuck.
What we are watching in this series is television greatness. There is an absolute ceiling for me of a 7 just because of the set design and costuming. With the monumental acting that is being done by Peter Dinklidge and Lena Heady, I am raising it another point and putting this show at an 8 as an absolute minimum for the worst episode they can make.
This week, my final evaluation is at a 9. There was the smallest of disappointments in the casting and name change of Asha Greyjoy. She is one of my biggest book crushes, and they just didn't capture her sassyness  for me. I am willing to withhold judgement, because there is something about the actress that just may grow on me.
Otherwise, this episode was one of my favorite ways to spend an hour in front of a television. I am sure that I will see this over and over again. (something I never do with other series.)
650	MegasAV	2012-04-09	I gave this episode a 6, I really liked some parts but I feel they are really changing the essence of the book with a lot of the changes.  Although I loved how they made Pyke appear on the big screen the intitial meeting between Yara and Theon played nothing like the book and really I feel changed here character.  In the book it was Asha who on several occasions grabbed Theons cock, moreover with the fake identity she gave him, he then opened up to her about his plans, his successes in battle with Robb etc.  I know this may sound like nitpicking but it shows a certain cunning which the Asha character has, which I feel hurts the character portrayal. 
Moreover the Janos Tyrion scene felt extremely rushed I really would have enjoyed if they used some more dailogue from the book in that scene but alas I guess time constraints. 
In terms of Stannis I believe DornishSnakes post said it best.  This character they created is not Stannis none of his backstory has been told thus far in the TV show so I don't know how anybody can understand my favorite character from the book.  Not one mention of the siege on Storms End, no mention of him smashing the ironborn ships, his parents perishing on Shipbreaker Bay.  I know we are only two episodes into the season but I have no emotional attachment to this Stannis whatsover.
651	SerBarristan	2012-04-09	I ranked the episode a 5.  Here's my explanation from the Ep 202 discussion thread with a few additions:1. Asha was irritating as a character in the books when she was first introduced, IMO, but I grew to like her as the series progressed. The actress cast as Asha did not display her fire or spirit.Agree with last. She could have shown more spunk.3. Ok, we know that Stannis and Mel eventually have sex of some sort in the books because of the shadow babies. The scene tonight was just weird, though, and not a good weird. The actor portraying Stannis and the writers/directors do nothing to set up the idea that Stannis is shown, initially, to be so brittle that he will break before he bends. We do not get a sense at all of his unyielding moral compass, which helps show us later his total hypocrisy in the situation with Melisandre.Eh. I thought the scene was awkward as hell -- on purpose. But aren't you just quibbling with timing? Stannis is going to act like he's got a stick up his ass, don't worry. The hypocrisy will be quite apparent I think...4. First the silver and now Rakharo?! Wtf, writers/directors? I understand the rakharo actor was offered another role, but then the show could have done something different than make him a bizarre plot point.Like he rides off never to return? Wouldn't book people complain "what happened to Rakharo?" And then you'd have all these conspiracy theories that he might return later, in an even greater departure from the books. His death served a purpose. I liked how they handled this.5. Why is Sam suddenly a horn dog constantly thinking about and looking at women? Writers/directors, wtf?Are you serious? Considering that Sam is a 18ish-year-old straight male whose taken a vow of celibacy (a vow that kinda doesn't make sense) and may never know the love of a woman and hasn't even seen a woman for 6 months prior to epi 2, I think a certain amount of sexual frustration/curiosity is perfectly acceptable. So we now know he's an assman. Word. The fact that he takes Gilly to his friend Jon so they can help her is about as anti-creepy as you get. "She's a person, not a goat." Hello, that puts Sam about 1000 lightyears ahead of most men in Westeros. Props to Sam. And as a sidenote I thought the scene with Gilly/Jon/Sam was brilliant and great acting esp. from Kit.6. Littlefinger has now been written to be creepy as shit without book littlefinger's intelligence. So instead of a great game player who is creepy, we get a dip shit who is creepy.Well, what in this episode made him dumb? A bud of mine complained the same thing and I don't see it. Creepy? He's not watching his clients to get off. Dude deals in secrets. Remember last episode? "Knowledge is power." Cersei may not appreciate that fact. Doesn't make it any less true. He eavesdrops on his powerful clients to gain leverage. It's a lot easier to manipulate someone if you know all about their, ahem, proclivities. Not so mention people tend to say stuff they probably shouldn't in the throes of passion. Useful stuff.7. Loved Arya (Maisie Williams) and Gendry (Joe Dempsie).  Close to the book scenes and great interaction between the two. Their scene was the highlight of the episode. Jaqen was excellent for the small time we saw him. Yoren (Francis Magee) was excellent last season and this season as well.  Conleith Hill as Varys was amazing as always.Varys rocks. Yoren ditto. Exactly as imagined.My least favorite episode so far. It started well with Arya, though I thought she was more provoking than defensive with her stick on Rorge. The books have Biter lurch thru the bars and try to grab her which prompts her to hit him with her stick. In the show it comes more like a kid poking at a barking dog in a cage. Not a big deal, but not as good a scene as it could have been. I liked Yorenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s interaction with the Gold Cloaks, though originally the came with they Queenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s orders. The second Arya scene didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t sit as well with me how ever. Gendry doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t figure out she is a girl nor does she share her true identity until after Yorenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death, and doing it before hand felt a bit forced. The acting was good, but it would have been more natural if it played out in the original time line instead of so soon. Even one more episode delay would have been worth while.This just seems like wanting faithfulness to the books for the sake of faithfulness to the books. I get that this site is about the books, but appreciate the fact that it's an adaptation and choices will be made to -- in the showrunner's minds -- improve storytelling. So, I don't see the harm in Arya revealing her secret this soon. What difference does it make if she does it now, or later.Tyrion, Shae and Varys scene is very good overall. I am still puzzled at Tyrion keeping Shae in the Tower of the Hand though. A big part of his problems at court are keeping Shae secret, NOT being willing to take her inside the castle and having to sneak out to see her. It also pretty much eliminates the idea that maybe Ros will be Alaya or Chataya as there is no need for the character if Shae isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t being kept in hiding in the first place. Maybe she will in the future, but itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to believe that all the spies in Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know about Shae by then. But beyond that point, the scene was well acted and I enjoyed it. Great considering I disliked season 1 Shae.Yes agree. It makes me think there will be a scene made up to justify the escalation between Tyrion/Cersei. Like Cersei kills Ros maybe. But for what reason I dunno. On this point, the books made sense... Will look forward to what they come up with. Also, it eliminates an opportunity to see Varys/Tyrion sneak around the tunnels beneath the city and Varys in disguise. Perhaps they will manufacture another, but I liked that stuff.The council meeting where Cersei tears up Robâ<U+0080><U+0099>s offer went fine. Nothing particularly bad or good. Tyrion and Janos Slyntâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scene played out well, and I didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t mind Bronn being named captain of the city watch. I hate Joffrey ordering the killing of Robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bastards instead of Cersei. And Tyrion implying that she was worried the bastards might have a claim as the reason she wanted them killed was also silly. Two Hands had already figured out Cersei and Jamieâ<U+0080><U+0099>s secret based in large part from seeing these bastards, and the danger was even higher after Stannis sent the letters making the story public rumor. Joffrey would have been much more likely to kill anyone who spread the â<U+0080><U+009C>liesâ<U+0080><U+009D> than to kill Robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bastards, as he believed himself to be Robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s son.Sympathetic to this point but I think Joff doing it is plausible. TV Joff is older than book Joff, and he's more likely to assert himself. Plus, just because he's confident he's the heir, doesn't mean he isn't worried that someone will pick-up one of these bastard sons and use him to challenge the throne... Given the proliferation of kings throughout the realm, it's clear one does not need an air-tight primogeniture-observing claim to get into the action. Y'know? Plus, I  can see Joff doing it just because he doesn't like the idea Robert had other kids out of wedlock. Or just because he can. Joff doesn't particularly need a good reason to be cruel. King does as he likes.Now reasons why the showrunners opted for this? Maybe to build up the idea that Cersei is loosing control of the situation, which neccesitates Tyrion's badassery. Also makes Cersei more sympathetic, and frankly, she needs to be. Cause book Cersei is one-dimensional. Re-reading some of ADwD, I'm sold on that point.The most disappointing thing is that most of my complaints are not things that would require a bigger budget or significantly more time, but just writing issues that seem to be things that just as easily could have been written more true to the books.Yeah, I think in general though the writers have arguments as to why they depart from the source text. Whether those arguments are convincing is up for debate, but I think most, if not all, changes are based on improving the story-telling (in general and/or specific to the TV medium) and pragmatic issues (e.g. not confusing audience etc). Doesn't mean I agree with all their choices, but see why a good chunk of them make sense. A lot of the new scenes have worked really well imo.

First of all i must say i haven't read the books... Actually i read the 1st AFTER watching season 1, and i started reading the 2nd but stopped when i realized that i would enjoy more the tv series if i dont know what will happen (and read the books after). - So please, as the topic says NO spoilers, dont reveal waht will happen in the books (as some of you hint).
Anyway,
- I dislike Ros (and her fake crying) but liked Littlefingers intimidation (and just when i thought he would kiss her!!!!!)
- Tyrion is MUCH better even than season 1!!!!
- Cersei too is very good!
- I loved Yara, i mean the whole scene and the actress are amazing!
- The poor girl Theon enjoys in the ship was even uglier than described in the book...
- Arya is very good, Gendry not so much.....
I gave a 7, GoT is my favorite tv series by far, so i kind of wanted SOMETHING MORE from these first 2 episodes...... I hope i will get it in the next!!!

653	James Arryn	2012-04-09	IMO, they have weakened both Brothers Baratheon. Robert was just lacking in stature, but Renly they completely lessened, and they seem to be edging that way with Stannis. I guess I get why...too many titans makes for weaker plot when it's limited to 10 hours.
Tyrion, Varys, Cersei, Jon, and the whole Yoren crew were excellent. Pyke was visualy great somehow...especially when Theon first lands.
Everything else was in the middle. Ros is annoying me, and her crying defies her presumed life experience, but they used it well for LF's character. Same for Shae...her acting has always been a bit off key for me, but they used her well in this episode.
Cersei is easily the most improved character this season.
Edit: minor point, but why is Tyrion suddenly such a whistler?
Edit, again: Making Joff the baby killer doesn't bother me for as it applies to Joff...not inconsistent, more like bigger Bran attempt...but I'm not crazy about the motivation; sympathizing Cersei. I think they are concerned about 3-dimensional-izing long term characters.

Robert was just lacking in stature, but Renly they completely lessened, and they seem to be edging that way with Stannis.Agree. Why though? Trying to figure out what purpose it serves to depict Renly with less bravado. Or Stannis with less... well everything. Oomph, for lack of a better word. I don't think the showrunners make choices that depart from the source material willy-nilly. I may be wrong about that, but if not, I can't really grasp what storytelling purpose it serves..Edit: minor point, but why is Tyrion suddenly such a whistler?Think it could be a few notes from a certain song? That would be outrageously cool.

I don't think the showrunners make choices that depart from the source material willy-nilly. I may be wrong about that, but if not, I can't really grasp what storytelling purpose it serves..I think I unwittingly gave my response in one of my 20 edits. My best guess is they are worried about too many bigger than life characters...great for books, might make for bad tv, other than cartoons. Every attempt at filming the Illiad has had the same problem. If there are so many great could-be-kings walking about, it doesn't seem like such a big deal to be/get/kill/betray one.In the books the titans do have some flaws, to a degree, but they are more subtly revealed. In a show I guess they have to paint in broader strokes. Hated it with Renly, starting to get a bit annoyed with Stannis.I also think it's specifically the Baratheons because they are the biggest distractactions from the main plot conflicts they want to emphasize.

656	Dragon greyscale	2012-04-10	What's wrong with the Stannis scene? Well, let's see.  His entire character is based on him being this slave to duty and virtue, and in one of our first scenes with him he's an oathbreaker to his wife, cheating on her because she's "sick." Remember when John Edwards did that? Really screams a persons of honour and duty.Second - how he did it. A spur of the moment decision. Again, simply screams Stannis. And worse, a spur of the moment decision clearly driven by temptation, selfishness, and -- if I'm being GENEROUS -- a bloodlust for power (giving him "an heir.").Who is this character???So, regardless -- even if Stannis had sex is the book with her, it wouldn't have been anything like this.  Couldn't have been.But third and most important, the book is NOT clear that they had sex at all. You wonder. You consider. You debate with your friends. There's some mysetery there.**There is NO mystery in the HBO series, ever.** Everything is constantly being smashed over your head, like the viewers are idiots.This excuse about "medium" differences is also getting old. There have been great, multi-deminsional, suspenseful, complicated plots AND characters in TV. Battlestar Gallactica: Bill Adama and basically every character on the show. Most characters from LOST. Deadwood, The Wire.Game of Thrones the TV show and its characters don't stand up to any of those shows. In a story that was based on mystery and complicated characters, every bit of mystery and every complicated part of a character is being systematically removed. There was NO reason for that Stannis scene. Had NOTHING to do with "medium changes." The only reason it's in there is because HBO thinks it would get higher ratings if Stannis has hot, passionate sex scenes with a hot wizard, rather than if he didn't. The fact that Stannis the character would never have a hot sex scene -- and certainly not on the "spur of the moment" -- doesn't matter. This character is NOT Stannis, and HBO doesn't care.Last... the dialogue. Why is there so much of it? Non-stop chatter.  Where is a bit of silence, where it's just the camera and a character? Where their face shows what they're thinking, or better yet.. you wonder what they're thinking? In the Cersei and Tyrion scenes, those great actors have the good sense to at least pause in between sentences. In the others, it's just rapid fire, back and forth, endlessly, for the hour. I don't blame them. The writers have given the task of conveying everything by words, nothing by facial expressions or emotion.Is there ever going to be a scene that can compare with Bill Adama crying alone in his quarters? A scene that can compare with any of the LOST characters having a moment to themselves, where you don't know what they're thinking but want more than ever to find out?  Will HBO ever give us a scene like that? Like heck they will. Even though George gave them a raod-map to many scenes like that, and better, in the books.And don't tell me there's too much story to get through. There is also no rule that HBO had to do an entire book in one season. They could've developed the plot far more than they have. Look how slowly LOST was developed. Look how slowly GEORGE developed THIS story in the books! The books aren't thousands of pages for George's good health. They are thousands of pages because ALL good stories, especially this one, must be told at a certain pace.Here? Here Theon is tasked to go to his father's to get reinforcements and is there 5 minutes later, with his answer in hand. 0 suspense was able to build in that time. An outrage. The HBO show feels like point form notes, where getting through the plot is more a mechanical chore for the writers than a joy. And the audience can feel it.The first book alone could have, and perhaps should have, taken several TV seasons. Instead, HBO handcuffs themselves by trying to tell a 1,000 page book in 10 episodes, then complains they have to tell the story poorly because they were handcuffed. It's their own fault they're handcuffed, how can it be an excuse! Why do people buy that excuse?Frankly, I was embarassed by this episode. I haven't liked the HBO series at all so far. But this episode I didn't know what I story was watching, and didn't like it. An emabarassing disaster. If I'd never read the books, this is the type of story I would've laughed at. So simple, NO subtely whatsover. Even, dare I say, PREDICTABLE each and every time they stray from George's plot. Oh, let me guess: the hot female wizard gets a sex scene with the King.The execution of the story is brutal; and apart from the Imp and the Queen, all other characters have been dumbed-down so much, that they are no longer interesting. Stannis practically got a labotomy. What a tragedy. And this is just the beginning.So... How do you really feel? I mean, no need to hold back or anything.
657	DannySpud	2012-04-10	Think it could be a few notes from a certain song? That would be outrageously cool.Which song are you thinking of? The Bear and the Maiden Fair? The Rains of Castamere? I can't think of any others (except one that hasn't been written yet in the show)
658	ace	2012-04-10	Gave it a 5. The previous episode was a 6 so it's going down hill for me so far.
The entire episode had a really disjointed feel, jumping around, not spending more than a couple of minutes on any scene. It's become obvious that 10 episodes just isn't enough for such a long book even more so with the writers adding things not in the book.
The show has too much pointless sex in general. I know that people say that the books themselves have plenty of sex which is true enough. But the writers who are brutally cutting a lot of important and fan favorite things from the book, wouldn't cut even 1 second of completely pointless and irrelevant sex scenes. Take the scene with Theon and the girl on the boat. In the book it's 1 paragraph in a long chapter. In this episode it's almost as long as the entire travel to Pyke AND all the conversations in Pyke. And that for a girl that would never be seen again. I would've gladly given it up in favor of the feast in Pyke for example. Entire chapters in the books are cut to a 30 second dialog, entire paragraphs reduced to a single syllable, but every second of every breast MUST be shown.
And not content with all the sex in the book the writers feel the need to add even more. Loras and Renly for example, or the pointless Ros. Or in this case Mel and Stannis. Unlike Loras and Renly which you might say is implied in the book, this is IMO completely unlike the book characters. Book Stannis strikes me as almost completely asexual. He is all about duty. He married his wife out of duty, and he keeps Mel because she helps him do his duty. IIRC it is never explained how the shadows are made (I've just finished ASOS so it might be in later books) but I just can't imagine Melisandre as a seductress or Stannis as being lustful. And I don't for a moment believe that this scene was made for plot or character development. They just wanted to show her naked. That's no way to adapt our favorite books.
Daenerys is almost completely cut out so far, the only scene being the pointless death of Rakharo. Why?
Jaqen is too plain IMHO.In the book I imagined him as a sort of cross between Syrio, Drogo, and James Bond. Here he's so wooden, he says his lines like he's bored and half asleep. Could''ve hired Keanu Reeves to play him for all the acting he does.
I don't like that the bastard killing is transferred to Joffrey. Book Joffrey is evil enough without blaming him for every bad thing that happens. The writers are turning Show Joffrey into a cartoon that makes emperor Palpatine seem like a deep and nuanced character.
I expected the writers to play up Craster sacificing his sons more than in the books so wasn't surprised by it. Sure it's a little odd that he's got a new baby ready just as the Watch rides in and he goes to do the deed while they're stll there but I'm giving the writers the benefit of the doubt here. This might still turn out good if they develop it right.
I hate Ros and every pointless scene she's at. Every minute she's on the screen is a minute that could be Catelyn's or Arya's or Bran's or Daenerys', or any other character that we all love.'
It's weird because I loved the first season bubt this one is so far very mediocre. I'm just hoping the show improves with time.

659	SerBarristan	2012-04-10	Rains. It would just be neat if they were thinking that far ahead. I doubt it. But it'd still be a nice teaser. And they have to play it a couple times for the coup de grace otherwise folks won't appreciate the significance.
660	Ravenhair	2012-04-10	@Ser Barristan
If Tyrion were indeed whistling the Rains of Castamere, that would be so cool.....I doubt it for the reasons you state....but still
661	Elundin	2012-04-10	+ Ghost
+ Arya and Gendry
+ anything Davos, I just love Davos
+ Theon's visit to Pyke and his rediculue were awesome
+ Sallador Saan was AWESOME!
- Melisandre+ Stannis. Bleh
- Bron a captain?? Just wrong
- The entire brothel scene
They gotta stop giving all the awesome lines to Tyrion.

And they have to play it a couple times for the coup de grace otherwise folks won't appreciate the significance.Lol, that would be cool. I don't think they'll make it obvious, more like an easter egg. I want them to play more songs in general, especially "A bear there was, A BEAR! A BEAR!"eta: the whistling I mean. I hope it will be obvious during the red/purple weddings, especially the red one.

663	The Meeraculous Third Reed	2012-04-10	**There is NO mystery in the HBO series, ever.** Everything is constantly being smashed over your head, like the viewers are idiots.Firstly, I agree with everything you say about Stannis. I thought he was quite good in the first ep, but the scene with Melisandre was dire.However, the part I've quoted is vital, because you have to understand that for all their fanfare and praise, Deadwood, The Wire, Battlestar etc. never had particularly good ratings. GOT is balancing between faithfulness to GRRM and having to dumb down for audiences (including the casual viewer)Gave it 7 because I love the books, would've been lower.Asha/Yara is TERRIBLY casted. Where did they find that fat girl with baby , plump face. I hoped that promo pics ere wrong but , alas.. As the stupid name change wasn't enough.I hate to be crude, but I agree. She simply is not attractive enough to play Asha.Shortened thoughts because the site crashed on me last night.All in all, this was probably the worst GOT episode so far. The Stannis/Melisandre scene was very poor and does not really pay homage to the Stannis of the books. I was likewise very disappointed by the final scene (why did Craster need to knock Jon out?), the pointless brothel scene (Aidan Gillen is a great actor, it doesn't mean he always needs something to do) and the changes regarding Rakharo's death (unnecessary) and Davos' seeming atheism (though it is ages since I read ACOK, I'm 99% sure he was always strong in the faith of the Seven)However, there were some very good bits. Yoren was great, as were the other Arya scenes (though again I'm somewhat annoyed by the deviation from the book), while Dinklage's scenes were strong throughout. I also think the casting of Salladhoor Saan is very good, and Ghost looked very good (though wtf can Sam control him?) In conclusion, a very average episode, deserving of only a 4 or 5.
664	redriver	2012-04-10	I gave the first episode an 8 and really would have given the second a 9.The drama factor really kicked in here,whereas it was naturally absent in E1 due to it being a scene setter.
The Tyrion scenes were amazing and the line to Slynt,"I'm not questioning your honour,I'm denying it's existence" was priceless.
Great to see Arya and Gendry.The Theon scenes were great,but tinged with a sense of tragedy for me.
I like Davos' Merseyside accent.This is shaping up to be at least as good,if not better than Season 1.
Gave it a miserly 8,but really 8.5.

665	miguel sanchez	2012-04-10	good points:arya + gendry = super cutetyrion's dismissal of janos slyntsallador saan was spot on!balon was superb, finally the audience might "get" theonyoren was proper badasspyke was beautiful, my girlfriend commented on it immediatelydavos.mixed feelings:craster and jon cliffhanger. I agree with whoever speculated that jon will wake up the next day and craster will deny everything. whole scene was a bit clunky though, didn't feel right.yara greyjoy. asha is one of my favourites and I'm not so sure about the actress playing her. The meeting with theon did NOT live up to how great that scene was in the bookstannis and mel. we all know they've been making babies shadows. Didn't expect stannis to enjoy it so much. Mel manipulating him with the need for a son seemed like unecessary justification for him to sex her.tyrion puts bronn in charge of the gold cloaks?? book tyrion is not that silly, but tv audiences would not even understand the complexities of westeros well enough to understand why that is stupid. so it doesn't really matter.don't care:rakharo dies. served a purpose to remind us that dany has enemies at all sides. the question is will they kill doreah in the wastes? imo they'll keep her alive for a lot longerdolorous ed's "witticisms" weren't funny. they better make him funnier.the sex scenes. imo they should serve more of a purpose, but I'm not grabbing torch and pitchfork over it. Some people on here are such prudes apparrently. "semen! oh my!"bad points:ros + littlefinger. wasn't as bad as that cersei + littlefinger scene last week.joffrey ordered the killing of the bastards. I guess they want cersei to be slightly less hateable or something? why?still dirty about the lack of patchface. shadows come to dance my lordI gave this episode a 7, last week I gave a 6. Hopefully next week we'll get catelyn + renly's entourage. also sansa and robb were missed. Still wondering how they'll handle the north situation with no reek or reeds cast.

667	Vic-tarion Rattlehead	2012-04-10	I've gave it 5. While in the first episode I was mostly frustrated about the casting issues, in the current one my point of concern was the blatant adding of unnecessary footage.Some people here are saying, that it was necessary to show Stannis and Mellisandre sharing their body fluids atop of the map of Westeros, as it was necessary to show in the first season Renly getting a blowjob from Ser Loras. Well, I disagree with you. There is no need to chow every bit of info from the books to help the audience swallow it - GRRM haven't showed this stuff "on-screen" in his writing for a purpose - he was aiming to a bit more intelligent reader. And the film directors are definitely trying hard to make this season more RATING-vice than QUALITY-vice. Maybe they'll add some cameo appearance of Harry Potter in the sixth episode? It also can increase the DVD sells afterwards... Chuck Norris can also save the day!I have no problem with the vivacity of the sex scenes - GRRM provided plenty of these thro out his books. But all of these brothel sequences with an non existing Ros character (who is fucking her way thru the whole Westeros - and with the help of the script writers maybe will sit the Iron Throne some day) is a waste of a screen time - and we all know - that ten one-hour-episodes are clearly not enough to cover all of ACOK.The Iron Islands part was OK. Asha (it is really awkward for me to call her Yara) is nothing like I always imagined her, and Balon Greyjoy is a bit too young, but they are bearable...Two moments that pissed me off were: the death of one of Dany's bloodriders - Aggo, Jhogo and Rakharo are alive thro out all of the books - so why are you killing one of them? And also the encounter of Jon in the woods with Craster smuggling his son - as far as ADWD we have no curtain knowledge of what was the fate of his children. So why do the script writers are taking so much freedom in revealing all of GRRM's secrets so soon? I've just realized, that the guy with the beard that is talking to Jon/Sam/Grenn is Dolorous Edd - I thought it was Pyp who's grown a beard! Now that's a Hell of a BAD casting job!!! It's turning worse with every moment. And Rorge is looking just filthy, not menacing at all (and he's got a nose!).

We don't know what happens to the sons, but we know that they get sacrificed.

671	Vic-tarion Rattlehead	2012-04-10	Balon Greyjoy too young?Patrick Malahide is 67 years old.What age do you think Balon is?Let's see... The First Greyjoy rebellion took place 9 years before the starting of GOT and Theon was already 10 years old (with him being Balon youngest son). Theons elder brothers both took part in the rebellion, so the oldest of them should be at least 15 (at this age Balon himself killed his first man) then he was killed. So inclining that he fathered his first son at the age of what... 16? We'll have this sum - 16+15+9= The Iron King should be at least 40 years old - and you should keep in mind, that in the middle ages people didn't just lived happily till the age of 88 like in our times, and they looked older - especially a seasoned reaver like Balon, who's whole life was dedicated to warfare and permanent stress.He shouldn't look as old as Maester Aemon of cause, but still - in the series he looks a bit too young.

674	Songlian	2012-04-10	I gave it a 7. Loved the Pyke (amazing cinematography) and the Greyjoys (amazing cast), and everything involving Arya.
I think it helps at this point that I haven't read ACoK in, what, 2-3 years? I can hardly remember all the details, so when the show goes astray (because I get the feeling that it's kinda starting to) it mostly goes over my head and I can still enjoy the beautiful work of art this series is.
Also, three cheers for Ros with her clothes on.
675	ghost the direwolf	2012-04-10	I give it an 8  because I did not like the Ros+LF scene. A waste of valuable time  and Daenerys scene of too short. I Would have liked more Ghost and Jon. Apart form those points I did like everything in the episode. Tyrion time with Cercei, Jjanos Slynt and Vary as a delight.
I Loved Pyke  ( really as i pictured it) and the way Asha was portrayed  (Tom boy). I did not expect to see Sallador San or even Davos son so that was a good surprise and of course a plus.

676	ghost the direwolf	2012-04-10	I can only see her as Jeyne pool mentor, not Chataya or Alayaya as they are Varys girls and in the TV show Shae is already in the tower of the hand so I guess not Chataya nad Alalaya. I really would have liked the WW made of ice.
677	malrod	2012-04-10	i gave it a 5 out of 10 and i think im being very generous. the book is raw and certainly there is sex, but really now,it seems the tv adaptation is just playing to the masses. and im very disturbed about the portrayal of stannis. i thought of stannis has the hardened capable battlefield commander, who inspired loyalty of his men. in the tv series he starts off as  weak and easily manipulated by melisandre, and the sex scene is totally out of character. but i've read the books so........
tyrion scenes are spot on and carrying the show in my opinion.
678	A Murder of Ravens	2012-04-10	The HBO series is it's own animal. Comparing the book, your understanding of the book, and the episodes doesn't give the series much of a chance. You have to put the book aside and understand that if the author has given his blessings to D & D to interpret his work, and is consulted during this process, then I think everyone needs to step back and give the series a chance to succeed on its own merits.
679	lyvyathan	2012-04-10	I've seen quite a few people say this.  But how do you even get it up when you're only doing it for duty? Haven you heard the expression - As stiff as a guardsman (on duty)? /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
680	Ser Plissken	2012-04-10	I've seen quite a few people say this.  But how do you even get it up when you're only doing it for duty?Are you serious?  Melisandre was so hot, I reckon even Varys would have wanted her...
681	Blizzard	2012-04-10	I'm giving it a 6/7
+Liked the Davos and Salladhor scene
+Jaqen looks impressive and fits what I thought he looked like
+Tyrion and Janos scene was good
+ The ending was great
+Balon looks like I imagined
-Didn't like the long Theon sex scene with the captain's daughter
-Don't like Asha being changed to Yara
-Brothel scene was pretty pointless
682	QueenDork	2012-04-10	I give it a 5, and only that because it is still what is it. HBO is starting to irritate me though. Sure, they need to change some things to fit the limited time, but so much? For example, doesn't Gilly tell Jon that the boy babies are given to the gods? Why couldn't they just add that line and throw out Jon running into the woods after Craster with a baby? 
Now, I see a lot of people are unhappy about some of the sex. I understand that it IS HBO and apparently they have a sex quota to fill for each show they produce. But the time they spend on sex could really be used to further the actual plot. They might even be able to reduce some of the changes they make due to time constraints. On a side note, I don't understand what it is with tv and doggy style nowadays. Anyway.... 
I can accept these things. Once they give me more dragons, then I will be a happy girl. 
The thing that bugged me most was Asha (seriously, they changed her name? I didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t even catch that. Why bother changing it??) Her ride to Pyke with Theon is one of my favorite parts of the book! The banter is awesome! His shock when he learned the truth was funny! That COULD have been one of the best scenes of the show! It ended up being very disappointing. There was no banter, she LET him feel her up, which was just creepy, and the girl is not hot (not offense intended to the actress). Asha in my head is HOT. Sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a HOT pirate, bad@ss, â<U+0080><U+009C>omg I want to her!â<U+0080><U+009D> chick! This chick also seems a bit on the shy side. Asha? Greyjoy? Shy?? No way.

684	salt	2012-04-10	Ok.
I really don't understand this "there's too much sex in the HBO show" thing.  I hear it constantly on this forum, and it confuses the hell out of me.  The show doesn't show even 10 percent of the sex and debauchery that takes place in the books.  There is a scene in the books where a woman at Harrenhall known to sleep with Lannister soldiers is locked naked in the stocks in the middle of a courtyard so the men can come up and rape her any time they feel like it.  There is a scene where Euron's men strip and entire family of sisters naked and make them serve them dinner, and one of the Ironborn starts to rape one of them on the table as her little sisters watch and cry.  Neither of these scenes forwarded the plot in any way, or let us learn something about the characters that we didn't already know. 
I can promise you that neither of these scenes will make it into the show.
The HBO show has been practically puritanical compared to the shit we see in the books.  I'm confused as to how someone can read something of this nature and be totally fine, yet suddenly be offended when they see a tiny fraction of it on screen.

685	salt	2012-04-10	Mel says that her bed has seen little use since Stannis left. They also share a tent. What else do you think was going on?In my opinion this is one of the most commonly misunderstood lines from the books- directly after saying this Mel talks about how at all hours of the night she has been frantically searching the flames for any sign of Stannis.  I think this line was referring to the fact that with Stannis marching off to war she is constantly worried about her Azor Ahai, not that she hasn't been having sex with him.However, I certainly think the shadow babies were made through sex, you don't get pregnant with blood.

I'm confused as to how someone can read something of this nature and be totally fine, yet suddenly be offended when they see a tiny fraction of it on screen.I'm not of the "too much sex" camp, but to be fair, I believe the argument is that the sex scenes in the show are gratuitous and don't serve a purpose and the screen-time could be put to better use. That's a bit more nuanced (and reasonable) than saying "I don't like all the sex on HBO" (though there certainly are people saying that).With that said, I think most of the sex scenes do serve a purpose. For Theon, it's how we learn what he's thinking ala sexposition. I think he may actually have more lines mid-coitus than otherwise. For Mel/Stan & Loras/Renly, it's because a lot of viewers won't pick up on the hints and be totally oblivious to the relationships. In addition, TV is a visual medium, so I think whenever the showrunners get to show sex that is "necessary" they take it because its supposed to be visually stimulating... It may be playing to the "lowest common denominator," but to justify more seasons of a show this expensive, it needs to be more than just critically acclaimed. There is a tradeoff here between having a show that is identical to the books and having a show period. I got into this universe from the show-side (and later reading the books) so I appreciate how the adaptation differs, but also how remarkably well they've captured this world.... It's a balancing act, and if that means giving the smallfolk some T/A, violence, or what have you to keep their attention, let's do it!

687	Lord Ravenfrost	2012-04-10	6/10 My knee jerk reaction to this last episode was one of disgust I almost gave this a rating of like 3/10 but, I watched the episode again in non-fanboy mode and had somewhat of a change of heart. I really love the the way Tyrion is continued to be portrayed I look forward to his scenes as much as i looked forward to reading his chapters.I love the way him and Bronn interact they seem like they are probably good friends off screen and it shows in their performances. I like how they handled Theon's homecoming it was true to his first chapter in ACOK although I felt the scenes were rushed and was missing him meeting a very changed uncle before he rode up to see his father. I don't like this introduction to Asha/Yara we got I think the woman playing her missed what the character is about and apparently the writers did too it should've been Yara fondling Theon not the other way around. They should've included the feast as well to really put Theon in his proper place as a total outsider.I'm not sure if I can endure another dumb ass Ros scene, for someone who wasn't even a sentence in the books she sure chews up the damn scenery. I can dig why they put in Petyr scenes as they need to develop his character but I feel they could do that with more scenes with Varys and him or Tyrion or someone other than whores that really don't add anything important or interesting to the story. I think they have done a fine job with Davos, I like the actor playing him, I feel like the man did his homework and is doing the character justice. I don't like the man playing Stannis but I feel that was done on purpose, Stannis is a total douche in the books I've never liked him and the actor helps achieve this effect without trying. Salladhor Saan is also another pretty spot on performance, I think he's gonna be good comic relief for the whole Stannis/Davos storyline. The woman playing Melisandre is a bit more plain then I would've pictured but I think her acting may yet shine through and she'll end up doing the character justice (at least I hope).Arya's scenes are very spot on but again I feel like they are being rushed. I like the rapport that Arya has with Gendry on screen it doesn't seem faked and that is very important for their part of the story. All the supporting roles surrounding those characters are very spot on as well especially Yoren and Hot Pie the writers just need to slow things down a bit. I've been pretty happy with Dany's storyline so far even after they killed her blood rider and her Silver, neither were essential to the story and that really conveyed the direness of her situation. The real thing that bothered me was the last few minutes of the episode I just don't understand why that had to happen. Jon is a very important character and if they plan on moving the story forward they shouldn't be spending too much time at Craster's keep as there is a lot story beyond that setting. Whatever the writers have planned for Jon at Craster's I hope they wrap it up in the next episode and move on. I would've given this episode a higher rating but the whole brothel/twist ending kinda pissed me off.
688	White Raven	2012-04-10	6/10 The first episode of this season was way better and I expected more after it.
689	WormofBook	2012-04-10	The Littlefinger plot is by and far the most interesting to me in ASOIAF, I hope that all this characterization and sexing up is simply foreshadowing by HBO of delving deeper into that plotlet.
690	Lord Godric	2012-04-10	In ADwD Mel mentions that with Stannis gone she has no use of her bed. That is confirmation.
ETA: For some reason the iPhone app won't let me quote things. So this post and the next were about the revelation that Stannis/Mel were sleeping together.

691	Lord Godric	2012-04-10	I think some fans just don't like the fact that the show makes book things obvious when they missed them in the book themselves. 
Which shows exactly why it is needed to explicitly show it.

692	Dornish Hen	2012-04-10	I enjoyed the episode and gave it an eight.  
Love: Tyrion and Cercei.  In that moment you can see Tyrion has figured out that his sister is weak.  They sure do know how to push each other's buttons!
		  Arya and Gendry.  "That's not very ladylike."
		  Delorious Edd.  "We were having a serious conversation."
		  Sallador Saan.  I can't wait to see more of him.
		  Jaquen Haagar.  More!!
		  Pyke.  The scenes were awesome!
		  Ghost!
Not Sure:
		 Stannis and Mel.  I understand the need for the scene, but it was still weird and unStannis like.
		 Theon and the Captain's Daughter.  The way he treated her made me cringe way more than in the book.  I guess I could have put that in the love							   category for the strong reaction, but I have a hard time watching that scene!
		 Craster smacking Jon.  Huh?
Also, this is weird, but I LOVE the details they are putting into Dragonstone.  I love the dragon claw (do dragons have claws or talons?) glasses in the first episode and I love the sound of the waves crashing during the Stannis and Mel scene.  It kinda makes it a little bit unsettling.  Well, more so than it already was.

694	rmholt	2012-04-10	Edit: minor point, but why is Tyrion suddenly such a whistler?That isnt a minor point to me!  In the book he is always humming "their" song (his and Tysha's)  I guess the speakers pick up whistling better.  Maybe it is for those of us familiar with the book - even if they never explain it, we know what it is. Or not. Just my take.
695	Greyjoy67	2012-04-10	Some very harsh criticism here. Most non-readers are loving it from what I can work out, especially my mates. And there's not even been much action yet. I do feel it was weaker than ep1 slightly, so maybe a 7 would be a good grade.
The brothel scenes are indeed getting irritating now - it's not even a particularly entertaining set to look at while they're talking. I was so bored during the Littlefinger scene. 
The greyjoy scene where Theon meets Balon has got to be one of my favourite scenes in the entire show so far, and easily my favourite of the series so far. The casting's been nailed, and every line was said with such conviction. How on earth can anyone call the writing sloppy when there's scenes like that? Visually, Pyke looked fantastic too. 
Also, contrary to a few people, I loved the Stannis and Mel scene. Perhaps it was rushed a bit - they could have drawn it out, and made it a climax and shortened the brothel rubbish. But, I dunno, the way he knocked all the pieces off the table as he did it...there was something symbolic about it - especially the way it kept switching to 'foot shots'. It was really well pieced together.
696	GSP	2012-04-10	Agreed with everything Vic-tarion Rattlehead said, but even more so, just love that handle! That's old school my friend! Killing is very much Vic's business (both of em).
Can't really say anything that hasn't been said a dozen times here. Boo Ros. Boo brothel scenes. Stannis ... overcome by passion?! -- Boo
Salador Saan is Lysene isn't he? IIRC, aren't they described as being a notably pale people? The actor did a great job, the change works, and I'm not a stupid redneck that is bothered by such a change, but I'm just curious if I'm imagining this or not.
Hey HBO, I understand you like to stuff in all the sex scenes you can, but do me a favour and skip the ones where the people involved are hideous. Could really have done without seeing those nasty dugs on the boat.
697	Ravenhair	2012-04-10	@Lord Godric 
Baitac and I have both discovered we cannot quote when using our iPads.
698	int11	2012-04-10	I liked it and I'm not too worried about the changes. I found the cliffhanger pretty lame, though, but it might work better for non readers. And I don't understand why so many people like D. Edd ... he's a jackass and not the least funny.
699	Joslin9	2012-04-10	Well, I'm all caught now. I saw S2E2 twice now. the second time on HBO GO with the interactive explanations. I also read the synopsis on IMDB.
I never read the books. I gave the episode a 7. I thought Tyrion's character was great and Peter suburb. all the acting is first class. The art direction is wonderful and Pyke, was ver picturesque .
From the very beginning of me watching this series, I thought the sex scenes gratuitous, and I agree the brothel semen scene, was not necessary, and Theon's "passing his time on the ship" sex scene as IMDB phrased it, with the homely Captain's daughter, also unnessary. We already his full frontal scene in season 1. What's the point of the repition?
I like the ending being scary as the Whitewalkers take the baby. 
But why is a father sacrificing his baby boys like that?
700	Holmes	2012-04-10	As a reader, yeah: 4.
As a watcher, apretty good 7.
I think we can all agree Littlefinger/Ros was superfluous.   After reading this thread, that point has been beaten to death.  Having Craster whack Jon was a little jarring also.
The kid's scene was perfect, I thought.  Sounded just like kids bickering.
I do wish that Stannis/Mel was offstage though.  And that Janos Slynt had called himself Janos Slynt.
701	TeamDanyArya	2012-04-11	Ok.I really don't understand this "there's too much sex in the HBO show" thing.  I hear it constantly on this forum, and it confuses the hell out of me.  The show doesn't show even 10 percent of the sex and debauchery that takes place in the books.  There is a scene in the books where a woman at Harrenhall known to sleep with Lannister soldiers is locked naked in the stocks in the middle of a courtyard so the men can come up and rape her any time they feel like it.  There is a scene where Euron's men strip and entire family of sisters naked and make them serve them dinner, and one of the Ironborn starts to rape one of them on the table as her little sisters watch and cry.  Neither of these scenes forwarded the plot in any way, or let us learn something about the characters that we didn't already know.I can promise you that neither of these scenes will make it into the show.The HBO show has been practically puritanical compared to the shit we see in the books.  I'm confused as to how someone can read something of this nature and be totally fine, yet suddenly be offended when they see a tiny fraction of it on screen.Agreed. Spartacus has more sex in the first 15 minutes of any given episode than GOT had the entire first season. Sex is a theme in the books and we see all the various facets of sex. Sex is used for power and love and is another tool in the Game of Thrones for some. Also, it has a way of showing the different culturals and their attitude towards sex.
702	gordonah	2012-04-11	I wasn't impressed with this episode.
A big personal difference is that I read all the books after watching the first series, but I don't think that is a problem. I'm happy that a different medium needs to be adapted, and am intrigued by the differences introduced.
I am one of those who thinks there is too much sex. Yes, there is sex in the books, but I find a lot of that poor ad well.

I'm confused as to how someone can read something of this nature and be totally fine, yet suddenly be offended when they see a tiny fraction of it on screen.First, yes there is sex in the books but its quite sparse over 5 over very long books. But so far the show has had 3x as much sex as the book portion it has covered and with alot more to come that was never in the books e.g Renly/Margaery.Second, scenes you dont think will make the show for being too much, i would not be so sure. Dany/Drogo scene was not even rape in the books.Third  we are not offended by the sex. People are just upset because there is so little time to cover such a long book yet and most of sex scenes are a waste of screen time. But tbh if HBO wanted all this fucking they should have fucking commissioned more fucking episodes.
704	SFA-OK	2012-04-11	God I hate book purists. Please quit watching.I'm not quite ready to quit watching but I'm almost there. I'm not really a book purist, I'm just not a fan of heavy-handed/cliched/mediocre/middle-of-the-road writing which this show has an abundance of so far. Compare, for example, dialogue from the book to dialogue that the writer's of the show consistently use and there's no comparison. It's too bad there aren't other writers working on this show. I really didn't think HBO would be in favor of dumbing down a book adaptation after they did shows like the Sopranos but that's what is going on here, IMO. This show doesn't really even feel like it's on HBO (except for the nudity), it feels more like it's a basic cable type of a show.

I actually saw people on facebook claiming that the sex in the books were so much more erotic and sensual than in the show. I just had to laugh. I suppose it's a matter of human nature that makes people more easily offended by what they see than what they read...

Dany/Drogo scene was not even rape in the books.What was in the show wouldn't be rape by their standards so I don't understand why people keep saying it. In the book they have one tender night and after that he continues to take her hard, regardless of how painful it is for her, so the show just removes the back and forth because it would completely diminish her actions to finally take control over her situation, seeing how it's being covered in just two episodes.

707	zippypoodle	2012-04-11	Second, scenes you dont think will make the show for being too much, i would not be so sure. Dany/Drogo scene was not even rape in the books.No, in the book Drogo just took a terrified 13-year-old girl and twiddled her nipples until she turned into a sexpot. The show version was much more authentic IMO.
708	zippypoodle	2012-04-11	i gave it a 5 out of 10 and i think im being very generous. the book is raw and certainly there is sex, but really now,it seems the tv adaptation is just playing to the masses. and im very disturbed about the portrayal of stannis. i thought of stannis has the hardened capable battlefield commander, who inspired loyalty of his men. in the tv series he starts off as  weak and easily manipulated by melisandre, and the sex scene is totally out of character. but i've read the books so........tyrion scenes are spot on and carrying the show in my opinion.Well, they clearly had sex in the series so it's not that out of character. It came across to me very awkward and duty-like--exactly like Stannis Baratheon would have sex. He was going to turn her down until she brought up having a son, something a king is duty bound to have.And as others have pointed out, the sex is far rawer and often more disturbing in the novels.And Stannis inspires the loyalty of exactly no one in the books except for Davos. I challenge you to find one character in the book who anywhere expresses personal loyalty to Stannis other than Davos.
709	zippypoodle	2012-04-11	Too many brothel scenes?? GRRM vividly describes vaginas as 'c***s' in the books and happily writes about incest, but nudity and sex on screen 'makes you...ill'?Kudos for remaining faithful to GRRM's violently sexual world, IMO.This. As I see it, those people complaining about changes from the books are more often than not just failing to remember the books accurately.
710	zippypoodle	2012-04-11	Loras and Renly wasn't very obvious to me at all in the books, I only knew because I saw season 1 first. I like the show, but I don't like the changes they're making from the books. Certain characters are being changed for reasons beyond me, there is too much sex, and I think the icing on the cake was Arya instantly trusting Gendry.  Fuck me with a bloody spear, I didn't realise having a mixed opinion was a problem.No, but having an untenable opinion leads to inevitable and legitimate attacks on it.  I mean seriously. The Arya/Gendry scene was taken virtually word for word from  the book and occurs less than a third of way into ACOK. Your "opinion" is wrong because you're wrong on the facts.Today I deliberately went on various entertainment sites and read comments there. It differs like day and night from people, who have read the books,and those, who didn't. Viewers who just watch the show are amazed how good the episode was...		It's not just show-only viewers. On most sites, most BOOK viewers thought it was a really good episode. This site just has all the change-one-thing-and-I'll-hate-it whiners.   And even with that being said, over 70% of voters gave it a 7 or better, so it just tends to be said whiners who post a lot.

711	Sadie Stark	2012-04-11	I've got to say the first episode was my first episode where I'd read the book before watching it on TV. Needless to say there was some confusion and many moments I screamed at the TV saying:Why didn't you start at Dragonstone?That wasn't in the book?They had a feast not a small dinner?What about Stannis' daughter? What about the Jester? So you can tell I was quite frustrated. In Episode 2 the questions had died down as had the shouting at the TV screen. The main areas that I wasn't sure of is why Theon's sister is called Yara now and not Asha, why didn't Theon have the salt water blessing from his uncle and why did they add in Jon being nosey resulting in being smacked on the head by Craster! I do understand they can't recreate everything that is in the book, I just wonder why they have to add in stuff that isn't in the book. I guess it adds more for the viewers who haven't read the books...I'm excited about episode 3, I wish there wasn't such a long wait between episodes, but that is a good thing in a way that it captures your attention and you're hungry for more.
712	legba11	2012-04-11	9 for me, excellent episode. -1 for the excessive HBO moments.
713	Hasfast	2012-04-11	I gave it a 5.Ros' scene: absolutely irrelevant. That character is not necessary at all, although...
	Spoiler It's probable that they're grooming her to be the one killed by Ramsay in Theon's foolish escape attempt. Still, we'll have to endure her for far too long. She outlived her importance even in the first season
Rakharo's death... I don't see its point. He's more important than Doreah, yet they decided to keep her over him? Weird. I only give this event credit on behalf of its dramatic relevance.All Tyrion scenes, while improvable, are magnificent. Tyrion owns this book, really, and it couldn't be any less for him in the series. He's sometime lacking witty answers, though... he keeps silence before "valid" arguments. That's not much like him.The last two scenes... I can't say just how disappointed I am of them. In a single scene, they stomped on Stannis' inflexibility regarding justice and laws, which is probably the most important feature of the character. In this and all the other books, he recognizes Shireen as his heir. Why would he want a boy over keeping his vow? Seems like a rather weak narrative resource.As of Jon's scene... well, absurd, from A to Z. As some people has said here already, it's quite convenient that one of Craster's girls gives birth to a boy precisely when the Night's Watch is in there... And Craster's attack on Jon, dramatic cliffhanger, I give you that, but it incredibly complicates things., and it was unnecessary. They could've simply have Jon see the Other taking the boy, and then returning to camp pondering over what he witnessed. Also, I doubt Ghost would've been too far away from Jon if a White Walker was around.Kind of a doubt... Does Valyrian steel need any sharpening? I don't believe I read anything about sharpening such blades in the book. D.R.

The show version was much more authentic IMO.I was not debatig which vesion has more merit, its a sickening enough situation either way, The point I was making was that we cant assume HBO will not portray some "future events"  fucked up as they may be.
715	Strider	2012-04-11	I'm surprised that so many people are criticizing Stannis for succumbing to lust.  Egads, this duty-bound, puritanical, moralistic man of power is as tight as a drum.   Of course sex for him is going to be a lust-explosion.  It doesn't matter that this dimension of Stannis's personality is not portrayed in the books.  We are talking about a man of power.  Do you think he has no libido?
Edit:  I see now that a thread is dedicated to this topic, so I will repost my thoughts there.

716	The Monkey	2012-04-11	I thought it was great. Most scenes were spot on, especially Cersei/Tyrion and Arya.
Didn't mind the Ros scene (even though I think she's an unnecessary character as a whole), as it showed how terrible institutions brothels really are, but the cum-wipe was just disgusting and completely unnecessary.
Have to say I wasn't too impressed with Balon Greyjoy. I thought he seemed a bit frail and Walder Frey-esque, whereas I always imagined him be extremely hard and fiece, like Tywin Lannister.

717	GreenAppleFossoway	2012-04-11	I'd give it an 8, but it's a shaky 8, because I despise the girl they cast for Asha/Yara. Anyone else picture Asha as really skinny, but with an athletic body, and maybe a pony tail or something, and TAN? Like, really dark tan? And maybe be a bit more fierce, instead of perching on Balon's shoulder? I can't see the current actress talking about her "Lord Husband" and "Suckling Babe". This chick they picked for her would be better cast as the Captain's Daughter. Well, maybe they will cut the whole Euron/Victarion/Asha/Damphair storyline to save us from the awfulness.

Show Asha, so far, looks fine to me. Is she as beautiful as the Lannisters, or Daenerys Targaryen? Of course not; she's not supposed to be. She's supposed to look Ironborn, and she does.
720	Red Raven	2012-04-11	I'm not surprised Stannis porked Melisandre.  He's a fanatic and fanatics will do anything to prove their devotion.  He probably thought it was his duty to his new god.

725	Abifer	2012-04-13	I gave it an 8.  
Yeah there were a few 'WTF' moments (Mel/Stan, Jon/Craster) but I'm looking forward to see how everything's going to develop from here.
NW scene was brilliant - I was  cheering for Yoren and his badassery!
 A lot of people have complained about the LF/Ros scene.  I think Ros is like Marmite - people either love her or hate her!  But I can see it from the perspective of character development - LF got owned by Queen (regent) Bitchface last week so it's nice to have a little reminder that he has a harsh, yet subtle way of doing things.  I actually like him as a character!
Loved all the Pyke stuff, I love Theon's character in general and so far really enjoying how Alfie Allen has portrayed him as a cocky, womanising egotistical so and so.  
Still waiting for Dany's storyline to kick in...

727	Hedge Lawyer	2012-04-13	I gave it a six. If I could do so, I'd give it a 6.5.
There were three scenes that I didn't think were well done (Theon & Yara on horseback, the brothel scene, and the Stannis / Mel sex scene).
The good scenes were undermined to a certain extent by the disjointed feel of jumping between the many POVs.
It was enjoyable, but I think that it was the worst episode yet.
728	Hedge Lawyer	2012-04-13	I know I am comparing what I see in this season to what I saw last season from a quality perspective and I believe others are as well, so we have 12 episodes to compare.Exactly- hence the word "series" rather than "season."  There have been twelve episodes in the series, and I think that this was the worst episode of the 12.
729	Hedge Lawyer	2012-04-13	Terrible Stannis scenes.  Stannis having sex with Mel, fine.  Grunting with ecstasy as he does it?  Not fine.  And the hopeful "A son!?" line...so un-Stannis like it made me cringe.Exactly.
730	zippypoodle	2012-04-13	He wasn't grunting with ecstasy, he was grunting with effort. That's not a terribly conducive position for sex.
731	Hedge Lawyer	2012-04-13	He wasn't grunting with ecstasy, he was grunting with effort. That's not a terribly conducive position for sex.What?  It's not like he was holding her or lifting her up- she was sprawled back on the table.  It didn't look like such a stressful position that you'd be grunting from exertion after two or three pumps.  Regardless, I think that they could've built up Stannis more before having him hunched over and grunting. That, coupled with his gasping "a son," It just made him seem like a desperate, lecherous weirdo.  Stannis is one of my favorites from the series, and so far the show isn't doing him justice.
732	Fat Mac	2012-04-13	7 or 8 for me. Not too mad about the Stannis sex scene. Like Renly and Loras, the show is just emphasizing something that was already eluded to. The Craster scene was a bit blah but it was a good way to show what he was doing with his sons. I didn't mind the Ros/Littlefinger scene since I love every scene with Littlefinger, minus the one with Cersei /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
Really positive notes were
-Tyrion sending Janos to the wall (one of my favorite scenes in the entire series)
-The Sam/Dolorous Edd dialogue
-Arya and Gendry scenes
-Theon/Asha/Balon scene was really well done in my opinion
-Got to see grown up Ghost
-Varys/Tyrion scene
733	boojam	2012-04-13	I'm not surprised Stannis porked Melisandre.  He's a fanatic and fanatics will do anything to prove their devotion.  He probably thought it was his duty to his new god.It's not as explicit in the book, but for non readers what seems like a scene of rumpy pumpy leads to a supernatural solution to the problem Stannis was worried about.
734	moonsblood	2012-04-13	gave it a 6
The true to the book scenes were good but seemed rushed, except for theon going to poundtown, that seemed to take forever.
I'm not liking Stannis or Mel's portrayals.
Too much LF he is supposed to be mysterious
Ghost was awesome
Salla was hilarious
735	Red Raven	2012-04-13	...Have you read the books?Yes I have.  Since this is about the TV show, I was speaking of my impression of the TV version Stannis.  Mel was coaxing him in much like any cult leader would coax a follower and by the looks of things Mr. "I have a wife...I took vows"  Stannis bought it.That said, as for the book version, considering what he lets Mel get away with he may be a hesitant, methodical fanatic but a fanatic nonetheless.

741	Hedge Lawyer	2012-04-14	Um, no.  In standard UK English, this is the second series.  Each series has ten episodes.What is it in standard Australian English?It's a show written by Americans, adapted from a series of novels written by an American, produced by an American cable station, being discussed on a forum headed by an American, so don't be surprised if people discuss the show in American terms using American nomenclature.  If this were Dr. Who or Fawlty Towers or something, then you'd have more of a point.  I didn't intend to insult British fans- I didn't know the alternate British usage.  It was a language barrier issue.  Abifer understood that, so I don't see why you're defensive about it.

742	now my watch begins	2012-04-14	I gave it a 4. I'm almost done watching the show. I was hoping it would improve from last season but if anything, it's gotten worse. Unnecessary changes, changes for the worse, characters acting out of character from the book, etc. The writing is just mediocre, there's no way around it. It's clear they are targeting a mass audience (which is understandable) but the show and the writing definitely suffers. I just don't get some of the changes, though. Melisandre and Stannis? What the hell, And that's just the tip of the iceberg.And I'm starting to think the show's producers/writers are just looking for excuses to show nudity, lol. Not that I would normally complain, but, the semen scene, wow.Oh, any way HBO can work in T&A and sex they do it. Did you catch Tyrion's reference to Varys about Shae's fish pie?  At least that was a double meaning and not as in your face as the brothel scene.  I don't even think my husband caught that one. The brothel scene I did a double take and said to myself, was that??? Did they???  My husband didn't miss that one. I do like watching it, despite any changes and since I know GRRM is involved, it kind of gives me clues on who is really important and who isn't for the upcoming books. I've re-read the books 4 times.  My husband hasn't read them at all and he keeps asking me questions throughout the episodes - this last one I couldn't explain much because so much of it was different than the books.
743	Ran	2012-04-15	A tally of ratings: 7.04 unadjusted average, 7.15 adjusted score after removing the top 5% and bottom 5% of votes to normalize data a little. That's a bit lower than last week. Also, the median vote is 7 this episode, vs. 8 for the previous episode.
744	Conchobar	2012-04-15	Probably a 7 or an 8. Wasn't a fan of the ending but in all fairness, it is difficult to make a good cliff hanger this early on in the book.

Carice Van Houten herself cited that quote from ADWD when someone on twitter complained about Stannis and Mel not having sex in the books. Rickon is an important character. Rakharo is not.
747	DornishSnake	2012-04-23	HBO defenders of the Stannis and Mel scene: we're at book 2, not book 5.
You cannot seriously argue that HBO is just as mysterious and subtle as GRRM because in book 5 something is revealed. We're at book 2! GRRM milked that mystery and subtely for years. HBO milked it all of 0 seconds with its ham-handed approach.
It's the equivalent to watching a Sherlocks Holmes movie where the killer is revealed in the first minute. Then defending it by arguing it makes no difference because Conan-Doyle reveals him anyway...on the last page.
Maybe it'd also be OK if HBO told us who ends-up on the Iron Throne?? Because, after all, GRRM no doubts reveals that too...in book 7.
Sometimes people make me wonder.
748	DornishSnake	2012-04-24	To be clear: it does count as a (very) significant change to make these "big reveals" 3 books earlier. Also totally unnecessary and for the worse.
In addition to reveals being made so early, the HBO Stannis/Mel scene is not remotely consistent with his character in the books. Stannis and Mel may have had sex, but I doubt very much it's because Stannis can be seduced in under 30 seconds like a teenage virgin, or that he did it because he "wants an hier" and/or because his "wife is sick." HBO needs to recognize the difference between Stannis and a teenage John Edwards.
749	Quiet Isle	2012-09-14	I gave it a 9. It would have received a 10 if D&D had refrained from putting the Ros/LF scene in. The only purpose I can see it having is a foreshadowing to Qyburn.  WOW.  Thank you for that.  I missed it.

The books are pretty open about Renly being gay.  Melisandre did sleep with Stannis - Martin all but told it with the "bed" passage.  And Rickon?  OH RICKON?  Don't you forget about him.  He's going to be a major player in my opinion.  He's lost, confused, with no history to remember, with a massive aggressive direwolf, a wildling and headed to Skagos.  He's going to come back as THE ORIGINAL STARK.  He won't have to live up to others of his line (WHO BY THE WAY WERE NOT LIKE NED).  His Uncle was a WILD WOLF, not tentative like Ned.  Rickon is, I believe, going to return to help and will be an AWESOME WARRIOR, and I believe he's going to learn magic on his journey.
751	Queen of Whores	2012-10-22	Rated it a generous 8.
Pros:
Tyrion gets rid of Janos Slynt
Arya, Gendry, Hot Pie and Lommie scene
Theon's scenes on Pyke
Cons:
Pointless sex scenes
Daenerys not doing much
Jon cliffhanger
752	GreyWarden	2012-11-19	I liked it well enough. There were parts I don't remember reading from the book; but i'm getting used to the show adding its own touch to it, and most of the time they are very pleasant surprises. That part when Cersei talks about Tyrion's first joke is heartwrenching. Poor little guy.

760	Hookd	2012-04-10	I would not think that this is a spoiler of any sorts because I don't think it is that relevant...
Did Joffery always order the murder of the bastards?  I thought that from the books it was Cersei.
761	justashadow	2012-04-10	I rewatched this episode to see what I missed the first time. There is a lot of foreshadowing of things to come. I think that King's Landing doesn't know what has hit them with Tyrion as the acting HOK....I loved how he got rid Ser Janos Slynt and sent him to the Night's Watch and replaced him with Bronn but I think his exchange with Lord Varys was really interesting..not sure if either one will trust each other. I love how he eggs on Cersei with his wit...she doesn't know how to handle him but I felt sorry for her when she found out about what Joffrey had done.
The location of the Iron Islands was amazing (it took my breath away as far as locations go)and meeting the Greyjoys, another family to figure out. By the end of the episode, I felt for Theon..torn between his family's honour and his loyalty to the Starks. What happened to Theon's mother??
I loved Salladhor Saan, the pirate..a little humor is always good. What is with Matthos Seaworth though..he looked quite pale, I kinda wonder if they will explore his and Davlos father/son relationship. I like Stannis so far but I'm not sure about Melisandre and her religion..there isn't much said about it.
Ayra and Gendric wereintriguing at times , but why would she tell him who she was??
Dany's tour of the desert was a little short for me, I can only suppose she might be wandering for awhile.
The best part for me was Jon Snow and Sam Tarly in North with the Wildings. I loved Sam's lines..he certainly adds some humanity especially helping Gilly and with Ghost. I couldn't believe he followed Craster into the woods....I guess he knows the secret now...I liked the ending...can't wait for next week.
Btw, I just about to start reading the series.

764	Fakko	2012-04-11	I've read from other responses that Joffrey ordering the slaying of the bastards differs from the source (I haven't read any of the books, but may start soon). 
That revelation and Cersei's expression in response to Tyrion's assertion says so much about how bad the situation in King's Landing is. 
It would appear that Cersei has been grooming Joffrey for the throne for a while and I believe she thought she could control him there; effectively ruling by proxy.  With the killing of Ned Stark and Joffrey's reaction to Cersei slapping him and now this.
I think she realizes how little control she has and that she has released a cruel tyrant onto Westeros.

speculation follows (i haven't read book 2)
I wouldn't assume Cersei isn't the one who gave the order yet, she's more than capable of giving that impression if it serves.
I assume the greyjoys eyes are on Winterfell.
Glad to see the wild walkers back as this is probably the story arc that most interests me.
I'll call that tyrion's whore will be killed within the next few episodes.  Cersei will either do it or she'll be framed with it.
Hope Ghost eats Castors face next episode.

Some things seem obvious  to some of us because we know the books. But i did not pay much attention to what Tyrion said exatly either, i had to rewatch that part myself to confirm.
773	Mad Queen	2012-04-10	Why would he do that? The bastards not looking like Cersei's children are evidence of incest, so Cersei has an excellent reason to order them killed. But Joffrey? Is he admitting to himself he may be Jaime's son? And has he seen them? Does he even know they look different, more like Robert?
774	HyacinthGirl	2012-04-17	I don't think it necessarily means he admitted to himself that he may in fact 100% Lanniser, I think he was just aware that people would be more inclined to believe the "disgusting lies about [Cersei] and Uncle Jaime" if the black-of-hair bastards were around for everyone to compare to him. Yeah, it's something Book Joffrey wouldn't be smart enough to do, but it's not completely out of character for Joffrey to bypass Cersei in ordering murder (I'm talking about Ned Stark.)
775	RevengeOfTheStarks	2012-04-20	I really want to rant about this. First, the one positive aspect of this change is that in the show, Cersei's lack of control over Joffrey, her powerlessness, and the foisting of some evils onto Joff, make Cersei a much more sympathetic character. This combined with Lena Headey make her a really enjoyable character for me, whereas I absolutely hate book Cersei.
However, Joffrey now is basically baby Voldemort. The show has taken away whatever shred of humanity and vulnerability Joffrey had, and transformed him into a cardboard cutout villain. If he could grow a mustache, he'd be twirling it. In the book Joff is still a complete shit, but he also displays some really human insecurities and misgivings. You can understand why he is the way he is to some extent. It's not that he's just a complete sociopath. First, he's Cersei's firstborn, and the crown prince. There's a lot of pressure in that role, especially since Robert ignores his "children," leaving them entirely under the tutelage of Cersei. It's also clear that Joff is constantly seeking approval and validation, as evidenced by his reaction when Sansa witnesses his humiliation at the hands of Arya and Nymeria by the river. He also desperately wants to impress Robert, so he picks up on some throw away remark Robert makes about how Bran's better off dead than a cripple, and sends an assassin after him. Yes, Joff is still a horrible, fucked up human being, but he's believable and he has depth. It's this fleshing out that prevents his death from being entirely triumphant to everyone who hates him (including Sansa), making it at least as sad as it is a relief. Most of the horrendous things Joff does are motivated by his need to not be laughed at, to be taken seriously, to seem kingly in the eyes of others. They aren't maliciousness for the sake of maliciousness, but rather maliciousness for the sake of impressing people.
Show Joff in comparison is just a caricature - a teenaged baby killer. I've heard some people say that this is what Joffrey would have become if he'd lived long enough to get a bit older. I agree with this. It's clear that Joffrey was headed towards becoming completely ruthless and more importantly, entirely confident in his ruthlessness. But even so, the show never showed us his development leading to this point, so from the perspective of someone who doesn't know book Joff, and only watches the show, this kid is a flat, stereotypical, peach-fuzz twirling villain.
Finally, I don't think it was necessary to dehumanize Joffrey in order to make Cersei more sympathetic. Cersei was already fleshed out. She was abused by Robert, resented the way she was bartered off by Tywin to forge that alliance, fiercely protective of her children. And yes, also a bitch. But to make her more sympathetic for the screen, all they had to do was play up her Robert issues, and maybe invent more of a love/hate thing with Tywin.
776	The Greenseer	2012-04-20	It's this fleshing out that prevents his death from being entirely triumphant to everyone who hates him (including Sansa), making it at least as sad as it is a relief. Many good points, yet I have to disagree about his death being sad for anyone besides the Lannisters. Sansa was shocked, but I don't recall her being sympathetic. Don't forget she considered killing the little bugger herself but lacked the nerve.  And I'd wager that most readers gave a shout of 'hell-yeah!'
777	The Non-Human	2012-04-20	I agree somewhat. I really was hoping that Cersei might be lying or not entirely comfortable with what she had ordered to be done, thus ironically pinning it on his son. I mean, Joffrey admitted he did not even know about the bastards, in the way Cersei would have probably known (as demonstrated by her book self), so I still find it hard to believe that Joffrey jumped form ignorance to murderous rampage. What's more, I think there was no real foreshadowing of this, to the point that to me, it feels a little too disconnected.
On another matter: Joffrey's death was (and will be) nothing but a pleasure. There was nothing sad about his death at all.

It's not that Sansa (or probably any readers) felt sad about Joffrey's death. It's more like there was an element of pity/horror regarding the manner in which he died - definitely true in Sansa's case. To me anyway, though I'm glad he kicked it, the feeling is a little different from what I want for Ramsay Bolton, which is essentially to watch him get eaten alive by his dogs, starting with his genitals. Does that make sense?

780	Holmes	2012-04-22	He's not smart enough to think of the political reasons.  Robert treated him poorly, or ignored him, and publicly shamed him (in the show, when Robert stole Renly's line about being beaten by a girl).  He's been slapped by his uncle.  He just got slapped by his mother.  So I think its more of a giant fuck-you to Robert and a statement of his authority to his family.
781	Brucolac	2012-04-22	I don't really have a problem with it, because it isn't really out of character.  Joffrey was batshit crazy-GRRM modeled him after Caligula.   It seems like the show is going to let viewers think it was Cersei that tried to have Bran killed, so they are just moving something she did to Joffrey.  It is mentioned that she kills some of Robert's bastards in Lannister land and she does send people after Gendry while Joffrey orders a hit on Bran for less reason than he would for killing Robert's kids-himself being entirely illegitamate and his bastard brothers only half.  The sequence with them killing the bastards was a way to start the Arya/Gendyr storyline anyway.

782	Ronuja	2013-10-08	I am one who usually resents every little deviation from the book by the show no matter how small. In this case however, on balance I find I can accept their decision artistically to shift the blame for the baby killings from Cersei to Joffrey. Obviously Cersei has the greater motive for killing the babies, but perhaps, deep down, Joffrey feels a kind of reflected shame? It's clear both that he idolizes Robert, and maybe a small part of him somewhere is unhappy with his "Fathers" infedility, which is expressed indirectly in the Throne room scene where he provokes Cersei into slapping him. Cersei is patently humiliated by Roberts' extramarital exploits, maybe Joffrey feels some of that and wants to remove the reminders of his parents unhappy marriage? It's a long, crooked shot but as has been mentioned it wouldn't be totally out of character and it builds on the notion that Joffrey is acting increasingly ruthlessly and out of anyone's control. It certainly doesn't feel like a giant 'fuck-you' to Robert for me.
Â 
I don't think anyone could be truly saddened by the result of Joffrey's death, (I haven't seen the show's depiciton of it yet), but reading it, I felt quite a strong twinge for Cersei, her helplessness and the way she remembers Joffrey scratching at his own threat as his face turns purple. It's one of those rare moments when I've kind of felt for her, the other being when Jaime tosses her plea for help into the fire.
783	WiDMNDBAMMD	2013-10-28	I think Cersei killed them.
Â 
There's a power struggle going on between the Queen Reagent, King and Hand. Tyrion knows that only Cersei or Joffrey could've given the order.
Â 
Joffrey is too stupid to realize that the bastards are a threat to him, even if he did realize they were a threat he probably wouldn't have bothered to give the order.
Â 
Cersei on the other hand would have a real reason to want her dead husbands bastards dead so that every part of him is dead. She would know that it needs to be done

784	scurvy	2012-04-09	It is implied in the book that Melisandre and Stannis have sex and the seed results in the shadows - the first of whom looks like Stannis, but if I recall does its damage while Stannis is in a fitful sleep- almost as if it's him under a trance and his soul is doing the deed.  The second time it's clearly a birthed shadow that does the deed and Stannis' whereabouts are less relevant. 
But, that's not my issue.  My issue isn't with the writing off of Selyse and perhaps even Shireen and Patchface (boo).  But, it's Melisandre's seduction of Stannis.  He wouldn't be moved by the need for a son.  Now, the securing of the realm- the destruction of his enemies- his throne... those are things that would motivate Stannis to cast aside his honor and have sex with Melisandre.  It would seem that if she could tell him the power of R'hllor and how with his seed she could birth unstoppable assasins to destroy his enemies, well, he would go for it.  But, for a son, forget it Stannis would suck it up and live with a daughter with greyscale as his heir.

786	teemo	2012-04-09	I always was under the impression that it was rather lustless and done only to make shadow babies, with Stannis knowing what he was getting into.  With how strict and prickly Stannis is, and how tight Meli and Selyse are, I always imagined her encouraging Stannis to sleep with Meli.  Is that weird?  The scene didn't feel right to me.

The scene didn't feel right to me.No, your imaginings are not weird (unless I'm weird too) because I always had that same exact impression. Though its never said exactly, I always got the impression from Martin's writing and hints that Stannis did the naughty with Melisandre for one purpose only, to create the shadow babies and not because he was lusting after her. Also worth noting, I believe its mentioned more than once in the books that everytime Stannis does this, or gives his blood for one of the scrying in the fire rituals, it weakens him somehow, whether physically or mentally I'm not sure. That's why Melisandre can't do it too often, she is telling someone this. In my mind this made their bizarre sex rituals more mystical and full of sorcery, not just Stannis throwing her on the westeros table and pieces scattering all over the place like they're two lust filled teenagers going at it on the pool table at a frat party. bleh.
788	livewyre	2012-04-09	I always thought it went down the way it id on the show. Mel seducing stannis implying that it was the will of the lord of light. Stannis doesn't know about the shadows exactly. He remarks that renly's death causes him nightmares and he doesn't know why. I always thought Selyse willingly let stannis have an affair with mel as part of her devotion to the lord of light.

790	Chalais	2012-04-09	I always thought that Selyse was lying to herself about the affair, and purposfully threw herself even further into religious nuttery as part of said self-lying. But it would have been nice if the show was clearer about the fact that Stannis does have a living child, a daughter.

I always thought Selyse willingly let stannis have an affair with mel as part of her devotion to the lord of light.I've gone back and forth, but yeah Melis. is hot and supposedly a prophetess. No one on Westeros necessarily knows she's just one sorceress out of many, she's sort of the Red Pope there.I suspect Stannis enjoys his sex with her, though he rationalizes it in his mind.It doesn't work perfectly in the show but we'll see how this promise of a son develops. From Stannis's view, if you have a chance to have sex with her, and have a son with the head of a new religion, he could be king after Stannis sets Selyse aside.
792	teemo	2012-04-09	But if Davos can easily resist her and he has cheated on his wife in the past, what makes anyone think that Stannis couldn't resist her...??  Stannis wants to make brothels illegal, for crying out loud....and that is an extremely out-there idea for someone in Westeros.  Maybe he's just a total hypocrite, but I just don't buy them having sex was the consequence of Meli convincing Stannis that his wife is useless and that she can bear him a son....Stannis would not want a bastard son, even if he could legitimize him easily enough.

794	dtones520	2012-04-09	I've always pictured Stannis as a man who despised his wife for not producing a son, an heir, for him. He is a man of duty, I'd imagine he let the same about his wife. A high lords wife's duty is to produce an heir, sadly. So the fact all he has gotten out of this marriage is a sickly daughter probably makes him pretty annoyed.
So, Melisandre, using the allure of giving him a son, lures him into screwing her. Which makes the shadow baby. I don't think Stannis ever had a clue about them. Or at least the one that kills Renly.
795	Sci-2	2012-04-09	But if Davos can easily resist her and he has cheated on his wife in the past, what makes anyone think that Stannis couldn't resist her...??

If Stannis wins the Iron Throne the holy order of the Seven will be abolished. Stannis can easily set aside Selyse as Melis. is essentially the Pope of the Red God as far as Westeros will be concerned.It makes sense, though it is different from the books. But I like these changes as they keep me interested.
796	unBloodraven	2012-04-09	In the TV series though Mel stated that Stannis' wife only gave him stillborns (death) so Shireen doesn't exist, so there was alot more motivation for the hookup with Mel. Either way though now we know for certain now how that shadow demon thing that she released on Storm's End was created. I was kinda looking forward to seeing Patchface oh well....

797	Pliny	2012-04-09	Hmm... My impression was that Stannis doesn't really know what's going on, sex/shadowbabies-wise. 
This scene didn't feel right to me, and  TV-Melisandre in general doesn't feel right to me. In the show she seems (to me)like an obvious "bad guy," with evil, baddy motivations. In the books, she's a true believer, and thinks what she's doing is right, and she shows compassion to Cressen ("You can still spill the wine"). 
Also, where is Shireen? I thought she might be kind of important later on, given Val's reaction to her at the Wall.
798	teemo	2012-04-09	Yeah, I can imagine him becoming more lustful for her over time.  I just don't think that's how it started, or that Meli said, "I'll give you a son..." and Stannis just forgets his duty, honor and everything and starts screwing her so that he produces a bastard son ASAP.  I think it was something that was definitely more planned than that, and I honestly 100% believe that Selyse knows about it and might even be a instigator. In the TV series though Mel stated that Stannis' wife only gave him stillborns (death) so Selyse doesn't exist, so there was alot more motivation for the hookup with Mel. Either way though now we know for certain now how that shadow demon thing that she released on Storm's End was created. I was kinda looking forward to seeing Patchface oh well....She said that his wife didn't give him sons, only stillborns - she didn't say anything about daughters.  I think they did this on purpose so they could keep it vague in case maybe they want to change something down the road.  100% ruling out Shireen is pretty harsh..
799	Envie	2012-04-09	In the TV series though Mel stated that Stannis' wife only gave him stillborns (death) so Selyse doesn't exist, so there was alot more motivation for the hookup with Mel. That's not entirely how it was stated, so you're jumping to conclusions. Melisandre specifically said "Your wife has given you no sons, only stillborns" I'm fairly certain this was carefully worded so that the possibility of Shireen's existence could still exist. As we well know, like many early European monarchies, sons are the preferred heir to the throne and often daughters are bypassed in favor of a son unless there's no other choice.Stannis knows Shireen has grayscale and has always been sickly and that his wife has never been hearty in childbirth. He would definitely be motivated by the offer of a son as an heir. I still don't think it justifies the lusty sex scene, but that's just me.
800	Envie	2012-04-09	She said that his wife didn't give him sons, only stillborns - she didn't say anything about daughters.

801	Qhorin Halfhand and Yoren	2012-04-09	To me it is all about what is a better character.
I don't like the changes because a man seduced by a woman promising him a son, isn't particularly good character. Nothing particularly special about him. The Stannis of the book on the other hand.
The show Stannis does not come as Iron willed, extremely, extremely determined, not lustful, believing strongly in a moral code, believing strongly in duty, highly bitter and so on. He lacks both the interesting backstory, and other aspects of book Stannis.
I do think that book Stannis is somewhat of a hypocrite in various ways but it discovering or wondering his hypocricy is only fascinating because of the kind of man that Stannis is or mostly is. If in the books we immediately found him having sex for a son, very easilly succumbing to what Melisandre proposes, did not give a strong impression of being very determined, very bitter, very strongly believing in moral codes, duty etc, etc. It wouldn't work.  A king that is seduced that easily by Melisandre isn't as fascinating as their relationship in the books. Show Stannis comes of as a quite more bland character and not as interesting as the book version. So yeah that scene is problematic but the lack of sufficient development and backstory previously is also problematic.

803	Net-Viper X	2012-04-09	I agree with many of you in that I think that Stannis did it for the cause and duty, with no feelings towards lust. I also feel that with his wife being such a fanatic for this religion while Stannis himself seems to take it all with a huge grain of salt, that it would have had to be at the behest of his wife to have sex with Mel for the good of Rhillor and their cause. I don't think Stannis actually believed in the Lord of Light mumbo jumbo enough at that time to have done the sex act on his own because he would have thought it a hoax and would never stain his honor for such. It was his wifes belief rather than his own that ultimately convinced him to go through with it, and once he saw the results, thats when he started to become a believer.
I don't think for a minute that a guy like Stannis would have betrayed his honor for a son, since he would believe that the dishonor he engaged in while creating the child would carry over into that child and the Baratheon name that he carried. I think the only way he would have sex with someone else for a son would be if his wife was totally in on it and pressured him to do so. The fact he has stayed faithful to her all these years despite how obviously miserable he is makes it clear he would never betray their marriage willingly.
Edit: forgot to mention I was speaking of the book in the above mentions, and thought the scene in the movie was off because it didn't mesh with the event as it is presented in the books.

The fact he has stayed faithful to her all these years despite how obviously miserable he is makes it clear he would never betray their marriage willingly.This is also a good point. As much fuss as Stannis has made over Cersei and her incestuous relations and illegitimate heirs, you would think he would never ever want to tarnish his own image in any way, especially siring bastards on a foreign priestess. I doubt the citizens of Westeros would really take to that so well. I think they made a mistake with this portrayal of Stannis.
806	Sci-2	2012-04-09	Oh, I don't think of show-Stannis as even the same person as book-Stannis. Same with Joff, Shae, Cersei, Littlefinger.

Which inevitably does lead to some comparisons.I think Robert, Cersei, Joffrey, Ned and various others are good characters in the show despite possible changes and even with comparing them with book versions and finding that they changed things about some of them.While in the case of Stannis the show version is to me a pretty worse character than the books is. If they had made changes but he was just as good character even with them, I wouldn't mind but the changes have been detrimental in my view and the show Stannis isn't as good as he could have been with more development/backstory/better portrayal.

808	Catastrophe	2012-04-09	I didn't care for this scene. It seems like they're really rushing through the whole Stannis/Melisandre/Davos story arc. They're showing all the major plot points, but glossing over all the details that give those events meaning and nuance. It's the equivalent of reading a summary on Wikipedia instead of reading the actual books. If I was a TV viewer who'd never read the books, I'd have no idea what the big deal was about Melisandre's religion, or how it was any different than any of the other religions we keep hearing about in passing. It's completely unclear what kind of deity Melisandre worships, or why Davos and Cressen were so opposed to her, or why Stannis keeps her around.I also didn't like that they showed the sex scene between Stannis and Melisandre. To me, it worked better as one of those things that was heavily implied but never quite confirmed. Aside from that, it just didn't feel right. If they had to show a Stannis/Melisandre sex scene, I'd rather they made it more clear that Stannis was only "doing his duty" for the power that she promised him. As is, it seems like he secretly wanted to sleep with her the whole time, and went through with it as soon as she gave him the flimsiest of excuses. I also don't like how Melisandre belitted Selyse to him, since in the books Selyse was one of Melisandre's most fervent followers. I'd have prefered it if Stannis slept with Melisandre with Selyse's consent.

809	Lord Varys	2012-04-09	Mel and Stannis fall in love with each other (at least that's what I believe - it's clear from ADwD that at least Mel has honest feelings for Stannis). But this does not happen before ASoS. It's Mel who comforts Stannis after the Blackwater. Without her he would not have recovered. And they even have sex on a regular basis at the Wall, so I guess Stannis does actually enjoy sex with Melisandre. And I guess she doesn't have cold feet, so that's a plus as well.
But it makes no sense to assume that Stannis would enter into a relationship with Mel because he wants a son. If this was his motivation he would cast aside his wife and marry Mel. But neither the book- nor the TV-Stannis would do such a thing. Not with Shireen still existing, not without Shireen. He is married. But he would never legitimate his own bastard from Mel, so he would either marry her or not take her into his bed (or take on his table).
The promise of justice, the promise of the Iron Throne could move a man like Stannis. But not the promise of a son. Had Stannis truly wanted a son he would have clenched his teeth and shared the bed with Selyse more often. After all, the man knows that to father a son he has to share the bed of his wife.
810	teemo	2012-04-09	I've always pictured Stannis as a man who despised his wife for not producing a son, an heir, for him. He is a man of duty, I'd imagine he let the same about his wife.

811	Sci-2	2012-04-09	But isn't that his fault?  He very rarely even sleeps with her, from what I've read.  Why should he be annoyed with Selyse for that?Well it seems like show-Stannis did sleep with her a lot, but she kept birthing stillborn sons. I do agree that this show-Stannis is in danger of being less interesting than book-Stannis.At the same time, it sorta makes sense. In the books do you think Stannis would have agreed to make weird shadow-babies? Or he would have slept with Melis. just because she told him there was a magical ritual that required it?We may be giving book-Stannis too much credit here.
812	Lord Varys	2012-04-09	I guess it would have been better to give Mel and Stannis their first sex scene at Storm's End. As I see it, this is much more likely. Mel might have convinced Stannis that he will get Renly's men at Storm's End, but I'm quite sure he felt really, really bad (and was in need of much 'comforting' the night before the scheduled battle (and the days before that). The scene in episode 2 should have given us the first glimpse about Stannis's next move (i.e. Mel should have mentioned that she has seen that Renly will die). It would have also been good to establish Mel and Davos as antagonists over the next move (attacking KL opposed to attacking Renly).
Mel is not that long 'pregnant' when she gives birth to a shadow (between conceiving and giving birth to the shadow who murdered Ser Cortnay Penrose could not have been more than a few days), so there was actually no rush to hurry intimate Mel-Stannis-scenes.
813	BabyMeraxes	2012-04-09	I was not too happy. I liked that nothing has been confirmed with them. Melisandre is being portrayed too much like a person, where as in the books I imagined her to be more of a force. However, I accept it. Mostly because they were almost certainly banging, as Melisandre will soon reveal. Also, this has the potential to make those Shadowbabies fucking RIDICULOUS.
814	Honey Badger	2012-04-10	It's a tough one as the books don't really explain it.  The shadow babies Stannis probably doesn't know about since he had that fitful sleep about Renly.  He doesn't seem practical enough to do outright murder, more like he's willing to look the other way as "R'hllor" does his thing through Mel.  I also think Mel is unreliable as she could be a perversion of her religion if Thoros of Myr examined her and was appalled by the shadow babies.  We only have second hand accounts on what counts as piety and what doesn't.
The seduction scene puts to rest the idea that Stannis was drugged or tranced while Mel made her babies.  This looks like outright consensual sex.  The books hint at lack of knowledge on Stannis' part as the creations seem to weaken Stannis' soul or spirit.  But it seems off from what we know of the books.  Stannis is willing to live a hard truth like her fucked up daughter, grinds his teeth in matters of honor, and is noble to fault, similar to Ned.  I don't see him cheating just for a son.  If he was that practical, it would have been easy for him to set aside his current wife, or just raise a bastard or whelp more children using surrogates.  He refuses to do anything "easy" in the books.
815	Drinking Cersei's Tears	2012-04-10	And they even have sex on a regular basis at the WallWha? Is this implied in ADWD?  Must have missed it...
816	Elundin	2012-04-10	This entire scene felt oh so wrong. It was completely out of character for Stannis. But that's my take anyway. Its purely television for dummies, so that they can explain stuff that happens down the road.
817	Jory	2012-04-10	Mel and Stannis fall in love with each other (at least that's what I believe - it's clear from ADwD that at least Mel has honest feelings for Stannis).		What.... ?

819	snax	2012-04-10	I haven't been particularly delighted by the Dragonstone scenes, minus the opening one, in general. First off, no creepy little Patchface? Aww... /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />   And the sex scene between Stannis and Melisandre seemed very off and out of character for him. Stannis seems like a deliberative man who will do or endorse something if he finds strong practical value out of it. I never got the impression that he was particularly attracted to Melisandre in a sexual way. However, their fucking right there on the table instead of a more "proper" place like a bed suggests it was a spontaneous act of lust. I just can't see that out of someone like Stannis. But eh, whatever. Nice titties. /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />

820	AndrA©s Garcia	2012-04-10	I got the impression from the books that Stannis and Mel slept together on more than those occasions where shadow babies were to be produced. One of the things that gave me that impression was Mel's line about her bed being lonely since Stannis left the wall. Did they create shadow babies whilst there?
By the way, how do you get and retain an erection out of a sense of duty and with no lustful feelings whatsoever? I'm not saying it can't be done, but yeah...
821	Sixshells	2012-04-10	Like other scenes, it gave me the impression that it was too much, too early, since their relationship only starts off after the Blackwater, in addition to being gratuitous.  Call me naive, but from the books, I didn't even believe sex was needed to make the shadow babies, only that people thought they were using the pretence of private magic rituals to have sex. I was under the impression that they indeed were doing a magic ritual, including drawing some blood and maybe even semen (think about it: you can make a baby as long as you can get you hands on some of that even without sex), as well as Stannis's mystical life energy or whatever. Except that Stannis being more of an opportunity believer and not on the mystical side, he doesn't really believe it works (and Mel probably didn't explain the shadow baby part), but he better try anything he can.
It results as being out of character from the book. It's not the first time, and won't be the last.
822	The Bread Viper	2012-04-10	To just highlight how dumb I am I had never made the connection between sexy time with the red priestess and shadow babies. I had picked up the hints that they were getting it on, but always though Stannis too honourable to do that type of thing and that it was simply rumour. Sad there's no patchface but I mean casting and make up would have been a nightmare.
823	Isis	2012-04-10	I like Mel much better than Stannis actually. I think she is pretty clear cut as a character in the show. Stannis, though, not so much. He has no defining characteristic/s. I am fine with characters being interpreted differently for the TV show - it's an adaptation. But, I don't know who TV show Stannis is and right now I don't care all that much.
Re. shadow babies. How this was acheived was implicit in the books. Much as I love ambiguity in my fiction it just doesn't work as well in a visual medium. George talked about this at the weekend, that some events which are implicit in the books (like the pies in ADWD) will HAVE to become explicit on the screen otherwise it won't work.
I don't mind the whole Mel and Stannis thing but it's way too early in the course of events and it did nothing to help show us his character. It could have been used to demonstrate him refusing her repeatedly over time before finally giving in. Instead it makes him look weak-willed, unprincipled, wishy-washy...
824	Greywolf2375	2012-04-10	The stannis we see in the books is when he is with people. When he is alone with Melisandre he is a different guyNo - i disagree.  That is the thing about Stannis - he is not two faced, he is not putting on a show.  He is 100% duty/law/right.  Whomever he is with sees that same person.
825	Milcov	2012-04-10	This really felt out of character to me. Stannis just wouldn't throw Mel over the Westeros table and go at it, nor would he be allured by her saying about a son (she should have been clearer or hint more about the shadow babies as well IMO). Stannis would know full well that any real son Mel gave him wouldn't be legitimate either.
Besides this though I love the music for all of Melisandre's scenes
826	Lord Varys	2012-04-10	Melisandre ponders in ADwD that 'her bed saw seldom use now that Stannis is away'. Considering the fact that it's also revealed in that chapter that Melisandre does not sleep all that much (only about an hour a night), and that she only slips into sleep while sitting at her hearth, it's obvious that Melisandre only used her bed at Castle Black for sex with Stannis Baratheon.
Also considering the fact that Mel and Stannis did not seem that close at the Wall as they were in ASoS (where Stannis spent practically all his time with Mel wandering through the bowels of Dragonstone and left the ruling business to his Hand Lord Alester Florent and his queen Selyse), we have to accept that Stannis does enjoy sex with Melisandre, or at least the comfort/joy her touch and warmth can give him.

829	Nukelavee	2012-04-10	I actually thought it was a terrible scene.  As in, a series ruiner scene.
I mean, it destroys so many things that make Stannis and Mel's interplay, and role, in the story interesting.
It gave away plot points well in advance of when they should happen, pacing and narrative wise, it's blatant and heavy handed, and, yes, it's not true to the characters.
It wasn't worth the free boobies.
830	Lord Varys	2012-04-10	Yes, Stannis could legitimize his bastard by Mel. But would he do that? Would Stannis Baratheon even considering legitimizing his child conceived and born in lust and infidelity? I think not. That's completely out of character. More so, if Stannis truly and desperately longed for a son, he would have had sex with Selyse on a regular basis.
831	Tourniquet	2012-04-10	HBO Stannis =/= book Stannis, and its very easy for non-reader viewers to grasp onto the idea that King's need heirs. Plus HBO loves showing nudity and it was probably an easy excuse.
I was very displeased with this scene, as I am a firm believer that Stannis has not slept with Mel in the novels...I don't think that his honor would allow it.
832	Artas	2012-04-10	Stannis is not about honour, he's all about duty.
833	Vuron	2012-04-10	I don't understand why everyone thinks that Stannis is the poster boy for honor.  Where is his honor when he assassinates his own brother?  We really only get one detailed view of Stannis in the books and that comes from Davos, who just happens to have a man crush and worships Stannis.
834	Tourniquet	2012-04-10	I don't think it was dishonorable to kill Renly. Renly had an army and was attempting to take control of the Kingdom. That made him an enemy of Stannis (the "rightful" King). Killing him was no different than if he kill Balon Greyjoy or Robb Stark...It certainly wasn't nice.But it wasn't dishonorable.

As someone said in the other thread, Stannis is all about duty, not honor.

As someone said in the other thread, Stannis is all about duty, not honor.I can envision a scenario where Stannis is not willingly sharing a bed with Mel. There is the possibility of sorcery being used. However I am a known Stannis apologist so my opinion is very skewed...
837	Lord Varys	2012-04-10	Stannis does not assassinate his brother Renly. His conversation with Davos indicates that he does not grasp fully that Melisandre used him (i.e. his semen) to create a being who would kill his brother. He has a hint of the truth, that much is clear, but I very much doubt that Mel went to Stannis saying 'Fuck with me, and I'll create a shadow creature looking like you who we can use to assassinate your traitor brother'. Stannis knew Renly would die when they had their last parley, his ultimatum revealed as much, but I doubt that he gave the explicit command to kill Renly. I rather believe Mel painted the whole thing as R'hllor enacting his will.
But I'm not naive. Stannis wanted Renly to die. And, in my opinion, he has no reason to regret it. Renly was a traitor, he betrayed Robert, 'Robert's children', and Stannis. His life was forfeit by all the laws of gods and men in Westeros. Kinship means nothing if you rebel against your rightful liege lord/king. Any lord/king would put his younger brother/son/sister to the sword if they plotted against him and tried to steal his crown/lordship/castle.
838	wolverine	2012-04-10	Didn't like the scene.  Seemed unlikely and maybe required more build up if they wanted to show it.
I hate hearing Patchface in the books and don't care at all if he is absent from the show.
839	Sci-2	2012-04-10	I'm just curious, for people who think Stannis was honorable in the books, how exactly Mel got him to sleep with her to make the shadow babies.
Because I suspect she told him pretty much what she tells him in the show, that he has to sleep with her. And yes Stannis has honor, but he also has no love, attraction, or respect for his wife. If your new Pope is undeniably hot, and you never loved your wife as you were matched for politics, and she says to be one with God you have to have sex with me...
Seems like many, if not most, would give in.
840	Tourniquet	2012-04-10	I'm just curious, for people who think Stannis was honorable in the books, how exactly Mel got him to sleep with her to make the shadow babies.She is a sorceress after-all. If she can birth shadowbabies and glamour men to look like other men and protect herself from poisons and see the future in fires, I think she would have the power to trick someone into sleeping with her...
841	Lady Meera Reed	2012-04-10	Although it could've been more subtle, I have no problem with HBO showing Stannis & Mel have sex. What I didn't like is the "reason". A son for an heir, really? That makes no sense. He already accepted that Shireen is his heir (as he told Ser Massey). This was so OOC not only for Stannis, but also for Melisandre. Now they both look like this one dimensional character with no mystery or ambiguity. I hate show!Stannis so far .. *clutches books*Being the rightful king, Stannis could legitimize his bastard if he wanted to.He could, but then he should've banged another woman years ago if he was so desperate for a son.I would've preferred it if show!Mel's reason was "I've seen it in the fires, this is what the Lord of Light requires for the realm" or something like that. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' /> At least it will still have mystery. It will show her dedication to R'hllor, & Stannis' dedication to his duty.Stannis is not about honour, he's all about duty.Exactly. Ned = honor, Stannis = duty."Honor, he called it. Well, honor has its costs, as Lord Eddard learned to his sorrow..." - King Stannis
842	Lady Octarina	2012-04-10	To me, his nights with Melisandre were probably motivated by her convincing him that was necessary to secure him the throne too. On the other hand, it's not absurd to think that she could have convinced him by claiming she would give him a son, like in episode 2.02. I mean, Selyse never was able to give him one, probably won't be able now, we don't even know if Shireen exists on the show, but if she does she's the same sickly child with little chances of surviving as in the books. A king needs an heir; if he needed to have sex with Melisandre to have a male heir (a bastard, okay, but he could legitimize the child), so be it, I doubt Stannis would have anything against the idea. Also, it would explain why hey keep having sex even after Stannis can't produce more shadow babies (not that lust is not reason enough, but Stannis is the kind of man who needs to be convinced that he's doing that for duty, not pleasure).
That said, I must say I simply loved that scene. That was when Carice van Houten was finally able to convince me as Melisandre; and Dillane's Stannis was so properly awkward that I can barely describe how much fun I had watching it.
843	Jerritus	2012-04-10	I figured the son she promised was the shadowbaby Mel (and Stannis) use to kill Renly.
844	Tyler Snow	2012-04-10	I was surprised at the brashness of it as well but I had always figured Stannis was sleeping with Melisandre with his wife's permission. Obviously, that would be the only way Stannis would do it and would probably see it more as duty than joy.
845	Lady Octarina	2012-04-10	I figured the son she promised was the shadowbaby Mel (and Stannis) use to kill Renly.Yes, that was probably what she had in mind, but I doubt Stannis knows. I'm among those that don't believe Stannis was aware that his sleeping with her would lead to Renly's death.
846	Parwan	2012-04-10	I think the problem with Melisandre starts earlier than the seduction scene. We go to Dragonstone and see a bunch of people on the beach. They are burning wooden statues. It appears that essentially everyone, including Stannis, has become a follower of the red god. Why? There is one person, Cressen, who objects. None of the men even respond to him. They are moving themselves away from the gods of their fathers, and the gods still accepted by most of the people in the Seven Kingdoms. Embracing a foreign religion cannot possibly help Stannis Baratheon and his friends gain alliances in Westeros. Why, then, would they accept such a religion? Is its theology that compelling? We are given no reason to believe this. Later, Davos's son talks about holy books and the power of prayer. This, again, is just one person, and I'm sure followers of The Seven could match stories about how their prayers were answered. 
Stannis is obviously interested in power. What power has Melisandre shown to this point? This is the main problem with the lack of a backstory, not the issue of whether Stannis has a daughter or not. Melisandre has no army, no navy, no military experience. As far as we can tell from the TV show, she hasn't performed any magic yet. Later, Cressen tries to poison her. He dies quickly, and she remains healthy and strong. This would impress a man interested in power. Thus, the "true king" might well move toward the worship of The Lord of Light--after the poisoning attempt, not before. Did Melisandre simply bewitch everyone? It's not clear.
847	Lord Hodor	2012-04-10	The "problem" everyone has with this scene has a name - Subtlety.
In the book the Stannis - Mel relationship is implied, always very subtle, but it is there for all to see.
On screen the medium prevents the subtlety, unless you want a 2 hour episode every week, (I do!), you get straight in your face booty.
To all who think Stannis is some kind of righteous, virgin but for the one time he had Shireen, against sex and masturbation need only to look at some "Abstnence Only" kind of reverends and preachers that make the news on the US every now and then and their sexual exploits.
If they are loud about being against sex, its usually because they like it too much.
848	stevelabny	2012-04-10	I don't like Stannis. I always accuse him of only believing in duty and honor when it benefits him. He punishes Davos even as he rewards him, but he lets Renly's men off scot-free because he needs them.  He talks about he's rightful king, but he helped overthrow Aerys. Etc Etc.
That said, I've taken two implications from the books about Stannis-Mel
1> he's slept with her
2> he doesn't seem to know what's going with the shadow babies.
Which in my mind always meant she was beguiling him..and with more than just her feminine charms.
The scene played so awkwardly on TV, I might still believe that. At least until Stannis directly speaks about their relations or accepts responsibility for shadow babies.
Of course, I also believe the fight scene between Ned and Jaime in S1 clearly showed Jaime toying with Ned and Ned fighting for his life and then Jaime suddenly realizing he'll have to at least try... but a lot of viewers (and D&D themselves) seem to think that it showed an even match.
849	Sci-2	2012-04-10	He could, but then he should've banged another woman years ago if he was so desperate for a son.But no other woman could absolve him of his adultery in the way a Red Pope could.The only way Stannis can win is if Melis. has miraculous powers. But there's also the fact that for most lords - who likely don't care about religion save as a means of advancement - even if Stannis is defeated they can switch sides.It is a Game for the nobility, so unless you have a sincere faith in the Seven burning their idols doesn't matter. And there isn't any overly good reason to believe in the Seven, since unlike the weirdwood or R'hollor they have no magic/miracles.
850	Rockroi	2012-04-10	My issue with Stannis (in the series) is that he appears to be far less self-assured than the Stannis of the books.  This could be for several reasons, but one that must be relevant is that series-Stannis has only been around for 3-4 scenes while books Stannis has had a much longer time to grow.
In the books, Stannis is portrayed as a righteous power-house.  Not just Davos but Tywin, Varys, Cersei and Tyrion all recognize that Stannis is far, far more dangerous than Robb, Renly or Greyjoy.  Stannis is a proven battle commander who is hard, tough and supremely serious.  Varys goes so far to say that there is nothing more fearsome than a righteous man with a rightful cuase.  Davos obviously has deep resepct for Stannis and for very good reasons.  As time goes on, those who are introduced to Stannis are impressed with his seriousness, his honor, his desire to do his duty and his leadership.  This is no small list, either: people as diverse as Asha Greyjoy to Jon Snow are not awed of Stannis but give him his due respect at almost every turn.
Series-Stannis seems a far cry (so far) from that Stannis.  Series Stannis seems far more skittish; he lacks the Baratheon Confidence that he embraced so much in Clash of Kings.  Series-Stannis is mopey; he seems to talk far more about his slights and insults than he does recapturing the throne.  Again, that's a distinct difference from the book.  In the books Stannis does gripe, but his gripes seem very reasonable: he's pissed that Renly is trying to up-jump him; he cannot abide by Renly's lack of loyalty while Stannis was very loyal to Robert (even though he did not love Robert... even though Stannis eventually DOES admit that he did love Robert [scene outside of Storm's End]).  And really, who could blame Stannis for this?
Series Stannis almost appears petty; just another vain lord who wants the crown for himself.  But in the book, Stannis is described by many as duty-bound.  Melisandre says that Stannis- just like Jon Snow- puts duty above all else.  Stannis believes in his mission and in his roll moreso than in a glory.  Stannis after all, went to the Wall because the Wall asked and he believed them.  No other King- not even Robb -did anything like that.  Stannis states at one point that its not that he "wants" the Iron Throne; that "want" plays no part in the decision.  Instead, Stannis IS the King, regardless of choice.  Series-Stannis seems void of this duty-quotient. 
Which brings us to the sex.  At first I was put off by Stannis sex-scene with Mel.  However, I was reminded that in the books its revealed that Mel and he are in fact having sex (and the lack of recollection on my part says a great deal more about me than it does Martin or the show's writers).  I think Stannis has desires just like other men but having them revealed so blatantly is off-putting.  Mel tells Stannis stuff he wants to hear so its not really surprising that Stannis gives into a reasonable temptation.
But by doing so the show portrays Stannis, again, as weak insofar as Stannis appears like he's being tricked; that he is the pawn in Mel's game as opposed to being a mover in it.  THis is in contrast to Robert who fucked what he wants and does not think twice about it, or even Renly who, while hiding his homosexuality, has sex that he wants with peers.  Stannis appears to be having sex with somebody who is using him; hardly a peer. 
And this is almost 100% of what we know about Series-Stannis.  Unlike book-Stannis who was involvbed with Jon Arryn's discovery and held Storm's End from the Tyrell's and Redwynes and who crushed the Greyjoy Fleet, series-Stannis looks like the indicisive, unsure, vacilating lord who just wants to be King and has some hot woman tricking him into having sex with her. 
Now, with all that said, I am not sure its a bad interpretation of Stannis.  Book Stannis does resent Robert and clearly thought ill of Renly.  Asha Greyjoy sees his resentment of Robert and even Davos sees Stannis' ire towards Renly.  Stannis does harp on petty slights (and sometimes with good reason). 
However, i think whenever we talk about Stannis we have to see his whole image and so far the book is harping only on those aspects of Stannis that can appear weak or indicisive.  I think in time the series has to color in the parts of Stannis that are hard, honorable and tough.
851	Ferrum Aeternum	2012-04-10	Implied or not, I never questioned that Mel and Stannis had sex in the books (not even in ACOK).  If nothing else, Davos's observation at the end of the shadowbaby chapter gave it away - "He knew that shadow.  As he knew the man who'd cast it."  
That said, the seduction scene itself felt a bit clumsy and rushed.  I would have preferred Stannis resist Melisandre's seduction until episode 3 or 4.  The fact that he gave in to her relatively easily undercuts that iron will that Stannis is so well-known for.  I had no particular problem with Mel playing the son card as (I believe) the subject of Stannis's dissatisfaction with not having a son and heir is broached on at least a few occasions in the books.
852	Rohanne	2012-04-10	That scene did not sit well with me either. It is probably the first time I was disappointed with their adaptation of the books. Also, I do not care for all the extra sex scenes they keep adding that were not even in the book. I am not sure if they are trying to cater to a certain audience but I think they are a little over the top at times. I love the books but this is definitely my least favorite aspect about the show. Guess that is what happens when it is on HBO.
853	hotweaselsoup	2012-04-10	HBO Stannis =/= book Stannis, and its very easy for non-reader viewers to grasp onto the idea that King's need heirs. Plus HBO loves showing nudity and it was probably an easy excuse.I was very displeased with this scene, as I am a firm believer that Stannis has not slept with Mel in the novels...I don't think that his honor would allow it.I completely agree.  Stannis is so iron-bound by duty and rules that I cannot conceive of him knowingly sleeping with Melisandre.  That said, I can very easily see Melisandre glamouring herself to look like Selyse, and through this deception tricking Stannis into having sex with her.
854	Hear Us Roar	2012-04-10	Beggars can't be choosers we have seen Stannis drop his honor bs when the reality of the situation needed him to. Riding in battle with Pirates and Smugglers, using sorcery etc. The reality of the situation is that he does not have enough men and must do the not so honourable thing like kill his brother with magic and not in the field. So he also needs an heir as his wife cannot produce a son. Which all Kings/lords know is needed to ensure your security in you position. So Stannis bent the rules again, when the reality of the situation called for it.
855	Sixshells	2012-04-10	Although it would be possible to imagine Mel using glamours to trick him into having sex with her, I don't see him accepting simply in the hopes of having a (bastard) son that he might eventually legitimise. If that motivation were present in him, he would have used it a long time ago to sire bastards, maybe as rationalisation to allow himself to act on his attraction for women he might have met. Or it would be necessary for the two of them to argue that now that he is king, he cannot let his kingdom without an heir, which would excuse his breaking his marriage vows. That I would be more ready to buy, but not in the way it's described in the show.But no other woman could absolve him of his adultery in the way a Red Pope could.Stannis is a self-righteous prick who places his own sense of morality and justice above all else and doesn't give a crap about the gods, unless he can use other's belief in them (and even so he is often reluctant). I totally believe that he is ready to do dishonourable things if he sees interest in doing so, but only if he can justify it to himself. Mel absolving him of his sin under the eye of the Red God would do little to him. Rationalising about how it would help him reinforce his power in the long run (including by humouring the very powerful sorceress at her side, even if he clearly does not realise all that it entails), sure.

856	congokong	2012-04-10	I didn't mind this scene, but rather how Stannis is being portrayed. He seems unsure of himself, restless, and brainwashed somewhat. The actor doesn't portray the iron will I'd expect. I just don't see him as the character I know from the books.
In the books there's no indication that he's brainwashed. He doesn't embrace Rhilor but listens to Melisandre because the Seven never helped him and he needs an ace in the hole to overcome his enemies. I bet he had sex with Melisandre in the books but he doesn't show any love for her, but rather need.
And no, the promise of a bastard son wouldn't convince him to do her on the table.

Plus a son between herself and Stannis would be seen as both a royal and spiritual force.

(Because GRRM is not known for subtlety when POVs are in sexual relationships, is he?)It is more of a difference between mediums, and structure. The show is not following a POV structure. Just because a book POV did not observe is does not mean it could have happened. Remember that.
860	Lady Stormheart	2012-04-11	Well, I thought he just did the deeds for 'duty' and did not take any enjoyment from it. Melisandre might have had to put him a trance during the process. I remember how he'd always come out of it very ill and weak. I didn't even think he was aware of what was really going on. Brainwashed?
I am aware HBO has to play up all the sex scenes for ratings and what not but come on. Stannis is not sexy.
I enjoyed Renly and Flowers scene better tbh.
Can't wait for the Jon Snow/ Ygritte scene, lol

That can be an active storytelling choice too, not just a a structural one. George is a fan of ambiguity in fiction, as am I.
863	Clariana	2012-04-11	For me Stannis bugger*ng Melissandre was totally out of character, and somehow ruined him for me.Technically speaking Stannis did not "bu**er" Mel, there would be little point in him doing so.  But I agree with the overall perception that it happened a bit fast... But then again they only have 10 eps in which to condense hundreds of pages.
864	Ghyran	2012-04-11	From the book my image of Stannis was that he wasn't really interested in women.. I was suprised by this scene.
I though season 1 was very much like the first book, but so far I'm of the impression that the directors are choosing to change details abit more in season 2.
865	Sofokles	2012-04-11	That just didnt seem to be Stannis because I was under the impression that Stannis havent even heard about thing called "lust".
But maybe they just had to make Stannis more mainstream male for the TV-show.
866	lannisterbannerman	2012-04-11	It probably would have been more effective if the sex scene between Stannis and Melisandre was implied rather than actually shown. For me personally, it made Stannis appear far weaker and more susceptible to manipulation than I think his character truly is.
I saw no 'lust' in the scene though, only a man's desperation for a male heir and the presentation of a possible way of achieving it. I do like Stephen Dillane's portrayal thus far but he still has a bit of proving to do. As for Carice van Houten, I think she very much fits the part. Melisandre has always seemed to be one of the darker characters in the series and her ambiguous goals and ideas are shown through Houten's version of the character.
867	birdsong66	2012-04-11	I didn't really mind the scene, and thought it rather well done by Dillane in that he managed to capture how uncomfortable Stannis is in his own skin.  As for Melisandre, I'm still on the fence regarding the actress.  IMO, she's not subtle enough as a TVMel, be it due to writing or acting skill.  Which is to say, overall, the problem with season 2 will continue to be the introduction of new characters, at the expense of other previously established characters, but without the backstory that accompanies each in the novels, the "fleshing-out" is sacrificed for time constraints.  So, we have succinct presentations befitting an hour viewing, rather than a more paced and methodical layering, as was presented in The Wire, Deadwood, Oz.  It is only a "problem" if one expected an exact duplication on screen.  It seems to me there is deeper meaning to the shadow-baby than simply a magical thing that Melisandre can produce.  Stannis is a character who must remind others that he "is not without mercy," but who is largely regarded as one with no capacity for mercy.  He is clearly DUTY motivated versus HONOR.  It is his duty to produce an heir as king, preferably male, and thus dishonoring his marriage in the service of duty fits Stannis' pathology, whether Syleese(?) is on board or not.  I mean, this is a man who cut off the fingers of Davos, who smuggled supplies that saved his life while under siege, for smuggling in the past.  The shadow baby, to me, is the same "shadow/shade" that the novels refer to describing the dead, as a concept, not physically present, but a shadow on one's memory, if you will.  That Donderion became a "shadow" of the man he was in younger years, as the toll of rebirth was paid, leaving only a shell of the strongest characteristics in personality is important.  It is the same with Stannis.  The shadow baby is his essence, (no pun intended) it is that thing that he cannot consciously bring himself to do, that is unleashed to do as he desires nonetheless.  Call it his soul, call it whatever, but it is his deepest urges, his darkest secrets, his wrath set free.  The shadow baby is a version of Stoneheart in that LS has become the darkest urges that were present, but controlled, while alive.  He grows weaker as Melisandre grows stronger.  Some would suggest he's actually dead, but continuing in a shadow/shade state himself.  I think he knows about the shadow baby in the same way Bran knows that Jaime pushed him out a window, in the deepest recesses of their consciousness.So, would he sleep with her?  Yes.  Would she give birth to his darkest demons?  Yes.  Will others suffer for it?  Yes, because he is without mercy and driven by DUTY alone.  And like his father, the shadow-baby is without mercy, duty bound, and ultimately, will be the death of Stannis.
868	ChromeWeasel	2012-04-11	That just didnt seem to be Stannis because I was under the impression that Stannis havent even heard about thing called "lust".But maybe they just had to make Stannis more mainstream male for the TV-show.That's my assessment as well. I'd prefer to see Stannis half-heartedly having sex with Mel. The passionate lovemaking from the show doesnt fit his character IMO. But it's not necessarily wrong, and it's probably better for TV. Mel definitely looked good in that scene. I just wish that they had made a better practical argument for the two having sex than Mel did. I pictured Mel winning Stannis over slowly as her visions come true and insisting that sex was necessary for the next step. This seemed too much like Stannis took the first offer.
869	Strider	2012-04-11	Lustless sex?  Dutiful sex?  A Stannis who has fully sublimated his libido into a life of honor, justice, and chastity?  Is that really how everyone thinks of Stannis, a saintly celibate?  Is this realistic?  Is this actually true to the books?
Of course, we don't really know, as we know nothing about Stannis's sex life, so we are all speculating.  Stannis has admirable qualities (why would Davos be so loyal to him otherwise); but the man is also a power-driven, puritanical, pathological narcissist.  He has a dark side.  In his quest to possess that which he deems rightly his (viz., the throne), he aligns himself with a witch, renounces his gods, and "kills" his brother (at least in his heart)--in essence he sells his soul to the devil.
His libido is not sublimated; it is repressed.  And in this last episode it finally breaks through his iron will and explodes in a paroxysm of lust.  Meiisandre's promise of a son may seem prosaic and uncanonical; but it's all tied into Stannis's "lust" for kingship, a lust that is clothed in the dress of honor and duty.  Of course Stannis wants a son.  The promise of a son is a promise of immortality and dynasty.  I do not think it is out of character.  Quite the contrary.
Stannis is a conflicted, complex man, which is what makes him so interesting.  And so I am not surprised to see him suddenly and violently take Melisandre on the table.  I suspect he is hating himself throughout the fucking.  
That being said, I do believe that Stannis has been miscast.  Stephen Dillane does not have the right bearing.  I do not sense power and strength in him, only weakness..

I think he knows about the shadow baby in the same way Bran knows that Jaime pushed him out a window, in the deepest recesses of their consciousness.That would be his id then, also agree with Strider about the sexual sublimation. It fits perfectly.Jaime is chaste, but not celibate, Stannis is repressed. The main male characters in AGoT cover a whole range of sexual traits.
871	Vvornth	2012-04-12	I sincerely believe that the TV series confirms things only hinted at in the books. I think it is the intention of Benioff and GRRM to make what is subtle in the books far more spelled out in the TV series.
So what we are seeing here in this scene is exactly what has been going on the whole time but which was veiled in the book.
872	Strider	2012-04-12	We all appear to have forgotten one other aspect about Stannis's bedding (or tabling) of Melissandre:  while the catalyst is the promise of a male heir, this promise is offered within the context of a call to a personal surrender to the god.  Up to this point Stannis has performed the externals of faith--he has said the words, he has burned the idols, etc.--but he has not yet given his soul toRhi'lor.  This act of surrender is accomplished by the breaking of his marital vows and his erotic union to the priestess of Rhi'lor.  Think Faustus.  Think Anakin Skywalker. 
Throughout the books we see Stannis sacrificing his duty for the goal of attaining his political and military goals, each sacrifice contributes to his moral and spiritual disintegration.  But giving his soul to Rhi'lor is a deeper, more profound act of betrayal.    He is giving himself over to the dark side.

But giving his soul to Rhi'lor is a deeper, more profound act of betrayal. He is giving himself over to the dark side.This, though I suspect neither Fire nor Ice is inherently evil. Both are forces in the world that must be balanced - think about Meera and Jojen swearing by ice and fire.

I suspect he is hating himself throughout the fucking.  That being said, I do believe that Stannis has been miscast.  Stephen Dillane does not have the right bearing.  I do not sense power and strength in him, only weakness..I never thought of Stannis as saintly. I thought of Stannis as simply disinterested is sex altogether. Part of Stannis's sexual disinterest could be his wife, but I expected that most of it was simply his stubborn and dispassionate nature. That has nothing to do with religion or purity. Some individuals simply do not care much for sex. Some find it distasteful, especially with someone you're not in love with. And Stannis doesnt seem like he's in love with his wife. I don't expect the book Stannis to actually fall in love with anyone. He's that much of a stubborn stiff for that. And Stannis remarks several times about how Robert had that quality in him (making other people love him) and Stannis does not.I don't see that as a good or bad thing. It's just Stannis's character. That's portrayed much different in the show.
875	Stannis is the Mannis	2012-04-12	Yeah I thought this scene was poorly done. Stannis is an early casualty of the HBO format this season.
For starters, they cut out scenes with his family to save time, but the result is you don't get the missing piece that Selyse is a devout follower of Mel, the reason she's there in the first place, and that Selyse encourages Stannis to follow her even though Stannis is reluctant at first. It also seems to me that they're trying to build suspense for the eventual shadow birthing scene by giving a reason why Mel can be shown as pregnant, and shocking the TV viewers when they find out that it's no normal baby. Assuming this hunch is correct, it's just one of a number of detrimental slights to the character of Stannis all for the sake of raciness, episodic drama/suspense, and other TV show "necessities."
The next issue is that HBO, wanting to make the show as racy as possible, forces the onscreen sex scene which takes away all subtlety and provokes a much different reaction from the viewer. It's not that I have a problem with the scene itself (other than the invented motives and lack of context), but they have laid next to no groundwork yet for the Stannis character. Very little back-story has been shown, or his iron-willed, dutiful, and honor-driven nature. In fact, the best we get of that is Davos telling Saan that Stannis is the most honorable man he knows, yet only minutes later he is sleeping with the Red Lady through lust and the manufactured desire of wanting a son.
Instead of building his iron-willed, dutiful character first, and subtly showing the sexual relation with Mel after the character has some credibility, they've chosen to essentially start with that. Although many people identify with and support Stannis in the books, it'll be near impossible for a TV viewer to be fond of a character that has done nothing as of yet but cheat on his wife out of lust. There's no coming back from that, either, because as far as the show is concerned, viewers' first impression will always be that of an adulterer, and when the show later tries to build on Stannis's identity of justice, duty, etc, it will just seem silly.
The whole problem is that they've removed any argument for those of us who believe in the book his motives for his exploits with the Red Lady were to win the iron throne and that if he was not encouraged by his wife, in the very least you get some idea that she would be OK with it because she vehemently follows Melisandre. Now, clearly these last two points are debated in the book by some, but the problem is it's not even debatable in the show because they've taken out key facts and are left with a 1-dimensional Stannis. And that, if nothing else, is their biggest misstep. They took a character that has layers and can be debated (his motives, his honor, etc) and created the opposite.
It's really unfortunate, because it'll be very hard for them to bring him back from this. I know it's early in the season, but they've already changed too many important background aspects of Stannis and they wouldn't have introduced things such as his motive of wanting a son if they weren't going to continue with it. And in the end, I feel all of these changes have just been brought about because of HBO's lack of time and need for sex and suspense. They've taken my favorite character from the book and created a character that even I don't like in the show.

876	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2012-04-12	Being that we do not have a Stannis POV and Weiss and Benioff know more about the story than we do, maybe Stannis did have a desire for sons? What lord doesn't want male heirs?
877	Stannis is the Mannis	2012-04-12	I don't think it's unlikely or even untrue that Stannis wanted sons. But if it was that big of a driving motivation for him (enough to get away from his established character as hard, just, dutiful, etc) I think GRRM would have made it evident in the books. I don't think it's fair to try to pin such a strong motive to a character when there isn't much (if any) evidence just because it could be true or because it simply seems to make sense. Therefore making a point of it being his motive for sleeping with Mel is a stretch in my opinion. And again, I really think they're just going to use it as fodder for the shadow-baby reveal which will undoubtedly be a big event at the end of an episode. But this whole issue is only a small piece of my big problem with that scene.And whether they know more about the story than us isn't completely relevant. The fact of the matter is they're adapting the story to a TV audience. They are going to take liberties and make changes based on how they think the story can be successful on a TV platform, and us readers aren't always going to agree with them. Just because something is true or becomes true in the show doesn't mean it's true in the books, although they do a good job for the most part.

878	Dragon greyscale	2012-04-12	Slightly off topic: is anyone else worried/curious how they're going to visualize the shadowbabies? I hope it doesn't come off cheap (which is very much possible). The main thing is that it doesn't look too similar to actual child labor... more like an exhaustibg physical excercise for Mel. I know it is described like that in the books, with Mel opening her legs, but I just can't visualize it with my mind's eye. At the same time, it should be made clear that M&S sexy times led to the shadows. I can see the shadows moving towards their prey but that can also become a bit cartoonish. IDK, I guess, overall, the emphasis should be on shadows, not babies.
879	Hyper	2012-04-12	Lustless sex?  Dutiful sex?  A Stannis who has fully sublimated his libido into a life of honor, justice, and chastity?  Is that really how everyone thinks of Stannis, a saintly celibate?  Is this realistic?  Is this actually true to the books?Of course, we don't really know, as we know nothing about Stannis's sex life, so we are all speculating.BINGO. We just don't know. We've never had a Stannis POV. Yet there are many who just are so *sure* that Stannis has no sex drive. But how would we know?Again... GRRM is writing these books "unreliable narrators". We only know what they see - or think. Not what actually happens when they are not around. And when the POVs do tell us something, it is always through the filter of that character. Davos practially worships the man, so he ignores or rationalizes away things that don't mesh with his view of Stannis. The same with Cressen. And Melisandre. But Melisandres POV, at least, gives a very strong hint that there has been an *ongoing* sexual relationship with Stannis.

I think his sex with Selyse is dutiful because she is ugly. I have no problem believing that his sex with Mel was lustful. Stannis has never had an attractive woman strip and grab his junk. If he's straight, he's going to bang her. The scene looked about right to me, because I imagine he was done by eight strokes or less.

If we don't agree on that, then there's no use arguing because we clearly just don't see eye-to-eye. I don't mean to argue that he had sex with the Red Lady, that it was right, or that he did or did not enjoy having sex with her, but his motive for doing so is the question at hand.This bit of your post in particular: "Stannis has never had an attractive woman strip and grab his junk. If he's straight, he's going to bang her." seems to be your own cynical projection of how Stannis would act in a situation rather than using the information we're given about him (which is all we legitimately have to go on). Again, we just disagree completely. But as I mentioned in my first post, at least in the books there is room to argue and disagree, in the show they've taken away too many facts and clearly painted him in one way, which myself and many others believe is the wrong way.

He disguises it to the outside world as being dutiful, but I refuse to believe it until GRRM writes it.
884	Lord Varys	2012-04-12	I don't see the problem here. It is already confirmed that Stannis Baratheon likes sex. ADwD did so, in that one tidbit in the Melisandre chapter. They enjoy each other, in fact. Stannis was not attracted to Selyse, that much is true, and he is uncomfortable around women (especially around atypical women like Asha and Alysane Mormont), but this does not mean that he has no sexual desires, or does not like having sex with women. Considering the fact that he is depicted as straight guy, we have to assume his sexual desires involve women. We don't not what Stannis likes/dislikes when having sex, and considering the vague picture of the joy a man might have when having sex with Melisandre, we can't be sure, but as of yet does not consider Stannis a bad (or weird) lover.
Stannis is definitely attracted towards Mel. And he always was. But I very much doubt that he started to sleep with her because she promised him a son. Nor would he have follow his own desires and humiliate/betray Selyse with no good reason. Stannis has no intention of becoming another version of Robert, who was made look like fool due to his sexual appetites (and the blind eye he turned towards his wife).
Despite the appearances, Melisandre never controlled Stannis. This is also confirmed in ADwD. All he ever did was heed her counsel. Mel never controlled or shaped Stannis desires (i.e. his ambition/determination to seize the Iron Throne of Westeros), but he let her have her way from time to time.
Considering Stannis's personality I can't imagine that 'I give you a son' could motivate him to forget himself and fuck her then and there on the table. This would have afforded something more, say, the Iron Throne, or Renly's men. This scene would have been really powerful indeed if Mel had promised Stannis to give him an army in exchange for his semen. This would have been rather irritating and weird to the audience, but, well, the riddle would be resolved soon enough. I'm not so sure that Stannis will be happy when he learns/realizes that his 'son' kills Renly and disappears into thin air. That's not the kind of 'son' Stannis had in mind...

We also cannot forget that he is a raging hypocrite 
	Spoiler burning his starving men for eating dead bodies, when he was about to do the same thing, if not for Davos.
 I do not doubt that he take her there on the table and still behave as self-righteous as he does. He does what he wants to do.
886	Iron Captain	2012-04-12	I agree with what many of you have already said.  I think if she promised him the iron throne, or at the very least Renly's army by having sex (or some other means to fulfulling his duty of taking the iron throne) then I could maybe seeing Stannis sleeping with her, regardless of it meant breaking his vow to his wife because he would in a way be doing his 'duty'.  But sleeping with her for a son is just self-serving motive and doesn't fit Stannis at all.

You believing that men are helpless to their sexuality and can't resist temptation through morality, duty, responsibility, or other motivations is ridiculous. It's no wonder that you project this line of thinking into characters in the book when you think that's how men actually are in real life.Nothing in the books implies this repressed, lustful persona you seem to have come up with for Stannis. The same Stannis who wants to outlaw brothels (but I suppose you'll twist this into his hypocritical attempt at covering up his filthy desires). Again, being that we don't see the scene and are only left to wonder about it, I infer the interaction based on what I know about both characters from actual dialog and scenes, whereas you infer your version based on an incredibly cynical and misguided belief that men are helpless to sexual desires. To each their own.

You believing that men are helpless to their sexuality and can't resist temptation through morality, duty, responsibility, or other motivations is ridiculous. It's no wonder that you project this line of thinking into characters in the book when you think that's how men actually are in real life.Nothing in the books implies this repressed, lustful persona you seem to have come up with for Stannis. The same Stannis who wants to outlaw brothels (but I suppose you'll twist this into his hypocritical attempt at covering up his filthy desires). Again, being that we don't see the scene and are only left to wonder about it, I infer the interaction based on what I know about both characters from actual dialog and scenes, whereas you infer your version based on an incredibly cynical and misguided belief that men are helpless to sexual desires. To each their own.You're leaving out the incredible hypocrite part.
889	Stannis is the Mannis	2012-04-12	You're leaving out the incredible hypocrite part.I would debate Stannis being a hypocrite with you but I have a feeling we would both be here a long time and in the end neither of us would have any change in opinion, so i'll just leave it as it is. People have different opinions on Stannis and that's part of what makes him interesting to talk about. But we are interpreting events in two different ways. It's clear you are none to fond of the character whereas I find him likable and intriguing; us arguing further will bear no fruit and change no one's mind.

890	boojam	2012-04-14	Yes, that was probably what she had in mind, but I doubt Stannis knows. I'm among those that don't believe Stannis was aware that his sleeping with her would lead to Renly's death.Twice this thread has given a away a major spoiler and it still seems to go over several heads.

892	boojam	2012-04-15	^It's a book spoilers thread though... idgiNot nullI thought the treads hereabouts were a confluence of the show and book (with almost all the spoilers belonging to the books, one would have to have seen a future episode to give spoilers for that.) Tho for book readers we have some idea that the adaptation will use information from the books that could count as spoilers for the show.Of course once they happen they won't be spoilers any more.
893	HyacinthGirl	2012-04-15	I'm not a die hard Stannis fan myself, and so I had no problem with the Stannis/Mel scene. If you think about it, it's exactly how it must have gone down in the books. But I have a buddy who loves Stan the Man, and he was really annoyed by the scene; because it "didn't do Stannis justice/wasn't how Stannis would have acted."Please. You all know he screwed Melisandre in the books. Possibly on the friggin' table. I don't get the inflated view of how awesome Stannis is: he talks about honour/justice/righteousness, but you all know he's a hypocrite. I'm not saying everything he does is hypocritical: there have been plenty of times when he is that "truly just man" that Varys talked about, but Melisandre, and R'hllor is an example of it. I don't think he's a bad character at all: I love the Davos chapters and Stannis is a very original character and all, I'm not Stan bashing. But how was that scene SUPPOSED to happen, if not by Melisandre seducing Stannis, urging him to give all of himself to R'hllor, promising him more power? (Yeah, the "a son?" line was a little weak, BUT THAT IS JUST FORESHADOWING, people.)

894	Lyeder	2012-04-15	I did not really enjoy the scene - but I expected it. It was hinted at several points in the books, so it was obvious that they would not let an occasion like this pass to have a sex scene.
However, I did not find Stannis particularly lusty, but rather angry and strong in that scene. Of course, in this particulare situation where he projects himself kind, the necessity of a heir might push him more than in other moments of his life.
Somehow, I also always got the impression (in the books) that Selyse does not mind the relation beween Melisandre and Stannis. She is so fanatically into that new religion that it is more important than her marriage (which has never been a passionate one).
895	teemo	2012-04-15	Cynical, no. Logical, yes. There isn't straight a man alive ,other than on tv, movies and romance novels, who is going to turn away an attractive naked woman begging him for sex. So no taken man would turn down a naked woman for sex?  Ever?  Alive?  In the whole world?
896	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2012-04-15	So no taken man would turn down a naked woman for sex?  Ever?  Alive?  In the whole world?...Is going to turn away an attractive naked woman begging him for sex when he hasn't any consequences to suffer. No, he will not, and if anyone says otherwise, he is lying to placate a woman.
897	teemo	2012-04-16	...Is going to turn away an attractive naked woman begging him for sex when he hasn't any consequences to suffer. No, he will not, and if anyone says otherwise, he is lying to placate a woman.When you say consequences, are you including guilt?  If so, I agree.  Otherwise, I think that is way too big of a generalization.  Plenty of people wouldn't cheat under any circumstances.  May be the minority, but they exist.
898	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2012-04-16	When you say consequences, are you including guilt?  If so, I agree.  Otherwise, I think that is way too big of a generalization.  Plenty of people wouldn't cheat under any circumstances.  May be the minority, but they exist. At least 45 - 50% of married women cheat and 60 - 70% of married men. I cannot even imagine the amount percentage of those in unmarried "committed" relationships, and these are only U.S. statistics.
899	teemo	2012-04-16	Well, I did say that the number of people who wouldn't cheat ARE in the minority, but they do exist.  To say otherwise is a gross generalization.
900	Jory	2012-04-18	I'm not a die hard Stannis fan myself, and so I had no problem with the Stannis/Mel scene. If you think about it, it's exactly how it must have gone down in the books.

(Yeah, the "a son?" line was a little weak, BUT THAT IS JUST FORESHADOWING, people.)Well, I'm totally on the fence about the writer's (D&D's) portrayal of Stannis and I'm not sure if they really get him or not. I've heard things in the interviews that make me think they do, and then the shit about Stannis wanting a bastard son on Mel just made me go "what the hell." He's not a hypocrite, by the way - not in my view of the character, at least.
901	Vandalism	2012-04-20	They should not have showed the scene. It went against Stannis' character and personality. They should have mentioned it subtly like the books did.
902	MyDogIsNamedDanerys	2012-04-22	Idk, I think if you watch stannis carefully during that scene its pretty obvious he was already going to "give himself to the lord or light" before she brought up the son thing. I suspect they put that line in so that viewers will make the connection between the shadow son and the sex.
Stannis motivations in both book and shoe - IMO:
50% "give yourself" to the lord and your enemies will burn.
50% hot priestess who actually wants me yessss...
It's easy to explain why Davos is able to resist and Stannis gives in.  Davos despises Mel, because she burnt his gods and (he thinks) she is manipulating his king.  Stannis being an atheist doesn't care about the seven, and he doesn't think he's being manipulated.  Attraction isn't only physical.  If you hate someone that's a pretty good way to resist their temptations.
903	7V3N	2012-04-23	The noise... Like, c'mon man.
904	7V3N	2012-04-23	I thought the treads hereabouts were a confluence of the show and book (with almost all the spoilers belonging to the books, one would have to have seen a future episode to give spoilers for that.) Tho for book readers we have some idea that the adaptation will use information from the books that could count as spoilers for the show.Of course once they happen they won't be spoilers any more.That isn't possible since some book events do not even make it into the show/are changed immensely. I have always interpreted this as a ACOK Spoilers topic.
905	Maria Underfoot	2012-04-25	I think that that scene (which I didn't mind nowhere near as much as I minded the brothel scenes, or Joffrey and the whores) helped explain the shadowbaby. Since we're not in touch with Davos' thoughts (''And he knew the man who had casted that shadow''), we need to understand that Stannis... planted (what's the word for that? :0) the... em baby in Mel. So in that sense, it was rather useful.
I want to ask, and I'd be grateful to anyone who answers, whether Selyse and Shireen were completely written off in the show. I don't think they've been mentioned so far, but is their existence acknowledged? Or is it like Stannis never was married? I definitely understand that the producers would want to both limit the cost and keep the audience from getting confused, but they could at least mention Stannis' family...
906	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-11	Selyse's existence is acknowledged: Stannis said 'I have a wife.' =D
This scene had me worried from the start. Melisandre is very different in the show, and while Dillane is a great choice for Stannis and I have nothing against him at all (on the contrary) I think stuff was changed to make him look more like a bad guy. His reaction to Renly's death and how they made it seem he knew everything that was going on perfectly well (contrary to the book) most of all. Why this has me worried? Well, it feels like they're preparing the audience for a soft landing for Stannis' eventual death by casting him like this... I also think it was Stannis' own idea to leave Melisandre behind, not Davos'. Hopefully they'll explore his character a little more later on 'cos right now it seems to me Stannis will only gain haters and fewer supporters than he did from the books... I can only hope they're doing it so it will be more obvious later Stannis isn't such a bad guy, but that's wishful thinking I guess.

907	rustypaladin	2013-02-23	"My issue isn't with the writing off of Selyse and perhaps even Shireen and Patchface (boo)."This is a big issue with me, I was very much looking forward to seeing how they did Patchface (he was one of the more interesting characters on Dragonstone).Also, I think this scene was just added for the sensationalism; let's face it sex sells.
908	Louis Cachet	2013-02-25	As far as i know Selyse and shireen weren't written off..
909	howland_reed	2012-04-10	This topic is not for complaints about Asha's name change, or the actress Gemma Whelan's physical appearance/likeness to Asha.  Both are wrong imo, but I can deal with that so long as the actress portrays the character well.I'd like to discuss instead the rushed introduction we got to Asha's character in episode 2.  It's a real shame really because Asha's one of my favorite characters in the series and a large reason for that was the brilliant introduction we were given in ACoK.  In one chapter, GRRM brought this bold, independent, playful yet seductive woman to life.Lost in the translation to screen was the fact that book Asha was the one who came onto Theon, flirting with him shamelessly while pretending to be a shipwright's wife looking to be whisked away by the "lord of Pyke."  Instead, what we were presented was mostly Theon groping her like the lecher he is.  Yes, she did play along (for like 5 seconds of screen time), but for non-readers, the scene was more about Theon being Theon, rather than igniting their curiosity about who this woman was.In the book, when she finally reveals herself as his sister, she does so at a feast and sits at a place of honor beside her father.  The way she handles herself and the laughter she evokes from the other men when she belittles Theon also demonstrated the respect she had earned from her peers, despite her gender.  We also lose great lines about her husband is her axe and her suckling babe is the dagger between her breasts.Instead, on the show, the way she just stands beside her father makes her seem like some dutiful daughter who simply won his favor.  Yes, Balon does talk about her successes, but television is a visual medium.  I want to see that she has the respect of those under her command.  I don't want to be told it.  It's sad when a book does a better job of this.This is why I particularly did not like the Littlefinger/Ros scene.  It was actually a decent, well-acted scene, and much better than the infamous Littlefinger monologue from last season...but it was completely superfluous.  It didn't really add any new character development.  The five minutes wasted in the brothel could've been better used to flesh out the introduction of the Greyjoys, who are pretty significant characters from here on out.Thoughts?
910	TedStriker5150	2012-04-20	I agree with this 100%.  You summed up my thoughts exactly.  Especially the fact that she was the one who came on to him...  she was pretty direct actually...  It wasn't Theon who did the first groping...  lol.  This in itself, before anything else, sets up her character as a "just one of the guys" kind of girl.A very memorable moment from the book that just seemed a bit rushed.  But I guess you can't flesh everything out. It's just that as one of my personal favorite character introductions in the book, I would have liked to have seen more.

There were two scenes episode 2 that advanced the plot not one micron.Even CoK gives precious little page time to Pyke.So D&D could have borrowed time from those scenes to play out the Theon/Asha meeting with more elaboration, cause outside of the humor it told us a lot about Asha and more about Theon and I call that plot advancement.So it was an odd choice.
913	Voshed	2012-04-23	I agree totaly with the first 2 comments. If a viewer hadn't read the book scene would have introduced Yara/Asha to the story but without a taste of presence within the Iron Island Clan that is evident as the story unfolds.
That said, I totaly disagree with the casting. I feel Gemma Whealan's was totaly the wrong person for the role and will be incapable of generating the aura and authority she has to display later on in the story, that is so evident in the books.

I think changing that scene was a bad choice when they could have just simply followed the story and not wasted time with the LF scene(i get that they need to show how heartless he truly is, but i don't care) and made theon's trip to pyke more than brief scenery and a hint of the madman they call Balon.
915	Peras	2012-12-30	In my head Asha Greyjoy is Robin from how i met your mother. Don't ask me why. 
I do not disagree with the cast entirely. She still has the looks of a proper iron islander, but yeah... could've been better
916	Nezzer	2012-12-30	In my head Asha Greyjoy is Robin from how i met your mother. Don't ask me why.I do not disagree with the cast entirely. She still has the looks of a proper iron islander, but yeah... could've been betterAgreed, could be better, but I think many readers envisioned Asha the wrong way. Check the drawings people made of her. Most of them show her with tight and short clothes, with a huge cleavage. I've always pictured her more like a Xena woman warrior, wearing real armor, than a RPG one with stupid bikini armor. The actress hasn't impressed me much so far, but she hasn't done a bad job either IMHO. Nina Gold has been amazing with the casting, and she was perfect in Rome with every single character. I believe Gemma Whelan will still surprises one day.
917	The Direfox	2013-01-10	I would also have liked to see the proper scene, but remember that the feast scene would have required numerous actors, a huge new original hall, and lots of time and money.  The writers probably chose to favor the LF scene over Asha's real intro because it was much less expensive and time consuming.
918	Rolex Baratheon	2013-02-13	Asha was the one at fault in the book, and the show changed it to Theon. I hated that. She looked wrong, talked wrong and acted wrong on a whole.

920	Lord Hodor	2012-04-09	Very meh. I was expecting an accent as tick as Syrio`s, instead we barely got one at all.
Some will say, but hey he`s a FM, he knows how to mask his accent. Which would be accurate, if he was trying to sound Westerosi.
"A Man Knows" or a "Boy has a friend" dont really sound Westerosi to me.
921	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-09	His attitude wasn't at all as I expected.  I imagined some slimy, creepy guy for some reason which is stupid because if he was slimy and creepy, it would be less likely that Arya would come to think of him as a friend.  I really liked the show's portrayal of him.  I hungered for more.  The entire scene was fantastic.
922	Flayed Starkman	2012-04-09	Yeah I have to admit I expected a bit more of a "flamboyant" Jaqen, A  la Syrio. But I think it was okay. 
But his hair color split was barely noticable.
923	Lady Octarina	2012-04-09	I liked him, my only problem is that I expected Jaqen to be much less attractive. But hells! 90% of the characters are more attractive on the show than on my mind, so...
But I loved how the actor portrayed him, and the comparison with the other two prisoners is just as striking as in the book.
924	TheEvilKing	2012-04-09	He was fine. Can't wait to see more.
925	WinterWarrior	2012-04-09	I thought he was fabulous. I am looking forward to seeing more.
926	Francis Buck	2012-04-09	I thought he was fine. He didn't blow me away or anything, but he was still cool, and I think for non-book readers, a lot of them will still feel that "he's creepy because he's so polite" vibe that most people got their first time through.
927	Nym_Stark	2012-04-09	For now, the Jaqen portrayed is okay, I need to see more to have an opinion but I was really waiting for a more red and white hair. /frown5.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':frown5:' />
928	Chelly	2012-04-09	Loved. Him.
Not just because I personally find the actor to be smoking, hell fire hot, but so far he only had like a minute of screen time and I am already intrigued by this man. He's courteous, friendly, and gives off this sense that he might be an okay person, but then he's in the cage with creeps like Biter and Rorge, yet he's not even worried. First, you know he must've done something to get grouped with the likes of them and secondly, the fact that he's not too concerned with his new terrifying roomies shows that there is something very scary and dangerous about him.,  I need to see more Jaqen, but so far I really like what I've seen. /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />
929	Howdyphillip	2012-04-09	I thought that Jaquen was perfect. Not only that, but Rorge was great, and they couldn't have done a better job on Biter. I can see the fascination that Araya will have with this character.
930	NW Deserter	2012-04-09	I'm curious where you guys got the impression in the books that he was ever "slimy". Arya makes note of the stark contrast between him and the other two wagon-captives - he seems polite, courteous, clean, almost high-born in mannerisms, just with the slightly creepy third-person speech and of course the odd hair. I feel like the guy playing him captured all of that quite nicely.
931	Reposado	2012-04-09	I liked him a lot. Other than the hair, which seems to be toned down across the board, not sure what more we could have expected. Don't think he shoudl have an accent as much as Syrio does since, for all we know, Lorathi accents aren't as notable for Westerosi as Braavosi
932	Jamie Lannister	2012-04-09	He looks brilliant. Not ridiculously extravagant and out of place, but handsome, enigmatic, sly and gritty.
Perfect.
933	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-09	I'm curious where you guys got the impression in the books that he was ever "slimy". Arya makes note of the stark contrast between him and the other two wagon-captives - he seems polite, courteous, clean, almost high-born in mannerisms, just with the slightly creepy third-person speech and of course the odd hair. I feel like the guy playing him captured all of that quite nicely.For me, the feeling that he was sort of slimy came from him speaking in third person and being consigned to the cage with the likes of Rorge and Biter. Him calling her 'sweet boy' or 'lovely boy' also felt slimy as I was reading, though this was sort of an indication that he knew she was a girl.  Also, while Arya notes the differences between Jaqen and the other two, she is not entirely sure how she feels about him.  I never thought of Jaqen as creepy or slimy in the same way I thought of Craster, but I most certainly expected him to be less clean or something.  Still, I'm very happy with his on-screen portrayal and it doesn't take the mystery out of his character.
934	Greywolf2375	2012-04-09	He was fine.  As, at this time, he is just a throw away character they introduced him, gave Arya time with the three of them and moved on.  If they had done more it would have seemed odd.
935	Caro99	2012-04-09	we saw too little of him, but so far i am really liking him! of course that the fact that he is really hot helps, but i liked how he spoke, and his accent, (we don't know how the people from lorath speak, so...) and i think he and maise will have some great screen time together- still, ought to wait till we see more scenes with him, but it was so sad to watch it in english only to have the stupid spanish subtitles taking away his third-person way of talking. he was saying "i have the honor of being jaqen" instead of "this man has the honor of being jaqen" i bet though the actor won't dissapoint us. so far all the actos in the scenes with arya are doing a pretty good job IMO /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />
936	tom9d	2012-04-09	Appearance-wise, I thought he was perfect. Just as I'd pictured him while reading. Not just him, but Rorge and Biter as well. Despite his minimal screentime, it was the part of last night's episode I was most excited for.
937	Envie	2012-04-09	I'm not sure how I feel about Jaqen's portrayal yet, we only got a tidbit of him and a few lines. Hardly enough to judge if he's going to become a fan favorite like he is in the books.
I will say I like the hawkish look of the actor though I expected him to have darker hair for some reason, I don't know why since he was supposed to have half blue hair anyways. I would expect with the grittier, dirty way they're making most of the actors look in the show, it makes sense that Jaqen riding in a cage with two other violent criminals is going to make him less attractive in some ways.
Also, I really thought Biter's look was spot on, but I don't know yet with Rorge, couldn't really see that much of him. The lines were done perfectly though.
938	Ferrum Aeternum	2012-04-09	He looks brilliant. Not ridiculously extravagant and out of place, but handsome, enigmatic, sly and gritty.Perfect.This.  I couldn't have imagined that brief scene any more closely to my experience with the book than it was portrayed on screen.
939	Tyrion-kratS	2012-04-09	it was ok. he wasn't at all flamboyant enough, and I'd agree with a lot of you who said we haven't seen enough of him really. His accent could have been thicker I thought. I think the hair was just a litttttle toooo pale, it shouldnt have been too bold as he's come from a black cell, but a little bolder than it was. other than that looking forward to more of him/arya.
rorge and biter were amazing too, cant wait to see how they do all the mountain and his men
940	iheartseverus	2012-04-09	It was wonderful to see the initial impressions of Jaquen from the 'Unsullied' (non-book readers) at TelevisionWithoutPity.  They don't know anything about him, of course, this is the first they're seeing him.  But they instantly recognize (1) he's 'different' than the other maniacs in the cage (2) but he's in the cage, so he's dangerous in some way (3) he's courteous, silky, and he's not afraid of his cage-mates, and the maniac cage mates don't threaten or attack him = he's dangerous.  (4) his third-person way of speaking is eerie.. as one poster noted 'A girl freaks out!'
That's a lot of good, insightful input for what?  A 30 second appearance?  Kudos to the show writers.

Kudos to the show writers.I agree..I am glad that so many people noticed him!  And I loved him, thought he was perfect.  It's going to sound weird for anyone to talk in third-person with a made-up foreign accent.  It's a thin line between goofy and mysterious and I think he definitely nailed it.

942	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-04-09	Jaqen was awesome although I wish the show was more consistent with the regional accents in order to immerse us more in this fictitious world.
Rorge is a frightening looking man and the actor is good, I just can't see why they did not bother making him noseless.  It would be good to have such a ghoulish presence and I can't imagine it being that costly or hard to have managed the effect, practical or CGI.
Biter was pretty good though.
943	Envie	2012-04-09	I agree..I am glad that so many people noticed him!  And I loved him, thought he was perfect.  It's going to sound weird for anyone to talk in third-person with a made-up foreign accent.  It's a thin line between goofy and mysterious and I think he definitely nailed it.Yes! You know - It was so well done I didn't even really notice it. Of course, we book nuts already know Jaqen talks that way and so its less eerie than it probably is for a non book reader (and I like the name unsullied for them haha). The actor has a good handle on how Jaqen should speak, if only for the brief minute we got to see him.
944	boojam	2012-04-09	I thought they have nailed the character with Tom Wlaschiha.
I wonder what non readers make of him?
If a man has read all the books by now, and what a man finds out about the FM.... then the more  a man finds out about Jaqen H'ghar the less a man knows about him!
By the by I have always been of a mind that he was not put in that cage, he put himself there for a reason.
945	iheartseverus	2012-04-09	I thought they have nailed the character with Tom Wlaschiha.I wonder what non readers make of him?See the posts just above yours...  /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />
946	Blaer Dayle	2012-04-09	I personally loved what we saw, he hit it spot on. I think he didn't show an accent as he has adopted the Westerosi accent being a Faceless Man and all.
The third person speaking is something I always understood as part of being a faceless man. He actually doesn't know his true identity any more, and simply refers to his "true" self as "this man", and others to "a boy/girl/lord/whore/dog/etc".
Rorge and Bitier were creepy of course, as I expected.
Can't wait to see more of these three.
I also subscribe to the theory that he was in the black cells for a reason, as Littlefinger had no doubts that a FM could carry out an assassination without hitch, and if I trust anyone on matters of deceit its LF.
I too was let down that Rorge had a nose, although it didn't make his portrayal any less creepy.
947	smo	2012-04-09	I thought he was great.  Can't wait to see more of his character and how he interacts with Arya. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
948	Davos55	2012-04-10	I was impressed! He is such an intriguing character in the book, and my brother (who hasn't read the books yet) called me and said, "Who is that guy in the cage?!?" I Just laughed and said, "Oh..you will see!"
Biter was great too, and Rorge wasn't as totally hideous as I pictured him, but still was effectively creepy!
949	strifed169	2012-04-10	this may be a bit off-topic but how did the prisoners ever take a piss/crap? I assume theyre too dangerous to be escorted to the bush and from what I remember they weren't shackled or anything
950	Hear Us Roar	2012-04-10	He got as much screen time as he needed. His role exapnds as their journey north keeps going
951	redriver	2012-04-10	Loved. Him.Not just because I personally find the actor to be smoking, hell fire hot, but so far he only had like a minute of screen time and I am already intrigued by this man. He's courteous, friendly, and gives off this sense that he might be an okay person, but then he's in the cage with creeps like Biter and Rorge, yet he's not even worried. First, you know he must've done something to get grouped with the likes of them and secondly, the fact that he's not too concerned with his new terrifying roomies shows that there is something very scary and dangerous about him.,  I need to see more Jaqen, but so far I really like what I've seen. /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />^This.
952	Indigocell	2012-04-10	He was more or less just as I imagined him, looking forward to seeing more of this guy on screen.  I wonder how his character is going to work in the tv adaptation though, I imagine viewers could be confused by the whole face changing aspect of this character.  If they think different characters with similar names are too confusing for new viewers, how will they handle a character who is the same, with different faces?
His hair color was toned down from the book but I think that falls in line with what they have been doing on the show so far.  Jaime's hair isn't quite as golden, the Targaryen's don't have purple eyes, and I guess a bold white streak doesn't look that good on camera either.

953	Songlian	2012-04-10	He looks brilliant. Not ridiculously extravagant and out of place, but handsome, enigmatic, sly and gritty.Perfect.He was great.So far, there's nothing I don't like in the way they handled Arya's story. Perfect execution, imo.
954	Milcov	2012-04-10	Wanted a bit more of an accent but that's nitpicking.
955	dtones520	2012-04-10	See, i never really pictured Jaqen as having a really thick accent. Especially after i learned more about the Faceless Men and them teaching Arya new languages. A good assassin should be fluid in multiple languages so they can pass for the person they are mismicking.
So him speaking the common tongue well makes sense to me, being that he is in Westeros on a job.
956	Lannes	2012-04-10	Everyone's mental picture varies, but, in my mind's eye, they nailed Jaqen.
I loved his amused smirk when Arya starts hitting the cage.....
957	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-10	I was trying to explain Jaqen to a non reader friend who wanted spoilers but it was difficult.  In the books, we are introduced to the idea of FM before we meet Jaqen so we aren't totally thrown off when he reveals himself as such.  But in the show, they've not brought up anything about FM.  The whole FM concept is completely mysterious and somewhat confusing until Arya gets to the House of B&W and it would probably be doubly confusing to viewers.  So how would this work?

So how would this work?My guess is that Jaqen will give Arya (and the viewers) a brief exposition about the FM.
959	Dacie	2012-04-10	I loved him. The whole scene was one of the best of the episode, IMO.
He was polite, charismatic, suave, with just the right amount of creepiness. Definitely the kind of person Arya (and the audience) would find very intriguing.
960	Crown	2012-04-10	I thought the entire scene was fantastic, was really looking forward to it.
961	Ser Dermett Corbray	2012-04-10	But his hair color split was barely noticable.I bet it'll be noticeable when Arya whispers the name to him in the bath house.Yeah no complaints from me. Thought Rorge and Biter looked good too.
962	Aurelian	2012-04-10	If I hadn't read the books I would have assumed that from this little bit alone he was someone to keep an eye on and would be important later on, he was intentionally made different from the other people in the cage, he was polite and charming and I haven't read the book for a while that was how I remembered him.
963	Talleyrand	2012-04-10	Jaqen was awesome although I wish the show was more consistent with the regional accents in order to immerse us more in this fictitious world.Rorge is a frightening looking man and the actor is good, I just can't see why they did not bother making him noseless.

So how would this work?"I've seen a man who can change his face, the way other men change their clothes."  - Doreah to Viserys, S1 E4.  Subtle to be sure, but it at least introduces the concept of facechangers to the non-book reader.Also, I imagine that when Jaqen and Arya get to talk more at length, he may do a bit more explaining about exactly...what he is than he did in the book.  And even if not, then it'll just add another layer of mystery to this mysterious character; a mystery that can eventually be unveiled once

He won't be featured all that much and I'm sure they could of CGI'd the nose off.  In Boardwalk Empire they do away with half of a guys face.  In my mind he is meant to be ghoulish.
966	Morrigan	2012-04-10	Loved.

In my mind he is meant to be ghoulish.I have no idea how much trouble it is to "remove his nose", but I know one thing: People without noses are NOT a pleasant sight. I know, we see a lot of gory, gruesome stuff on this show, but noseless faces are extraordinarily hideous (has anyone seen the picture of the afghan girl, whose husband cut her nose off? If not, DON'T google it). So, i don't really miss it, especially as it doesn't really serve a purpose that he has no nose (or does it?). I guess we won't see Tyrion lose his nose either.

In my mind he is meant to be ghoulish.But again Richard Harrow is at least a second tier character in Season 2 of Boardwalk yet Rorge is a minor character so it hardly worth the cost plus the lack of 1 side of his face is key to Harrow's character so the situations don't really compare.
969	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-10	I wonder if they are going to go all the way and have Tyrion get mutilated in the Blackwater episode.  Will it be his nose that gets cut off, or his ear or just a big ugly scar across his face?  I feel sort of dirty that I'm looking forward to some mutilation.
970	boojam	2012-04-10	If I hadn't read the books I would have assumed that from this little bit alone he was someone to keep an eye on and would be important later on, he was intentionally made different from the other people in the cage, he was polite and charming and I haven't read the book for a while that was how I remembered him.He's in a cage with a couple of really nasty types , lower that gutter rats.I would love the show to work in the fact that these two horror show guys are really afraid of a person so different from them, that ought to give the non readers a hint.I liked the part where he apologized to Arya for Rorge and Biter's behavior and then watch him smiling at Arya when she takes some whacks at them.I swear I think Jaqen was sent to evaluate Arya.
971	Herba	2012-04-10	Loved. Him.Not just because I personally find the actor to be smoking, hell fire hot, but so far he only had like a minute of screen time and I am already intrigued by this man.

I would have like to see fear from his cellmates, in the book they fear him because they know is his extremely dangerous and mysterious.

Will it be his nose that gets cut off, or his ear or just a big ugly scar across his face?  I feel sort of dirty that I'm looking forward to some mutilation.I was wondering this same thing as people were complaining about Rorge not having his nose cut off being a difficult thing to put on an actor... what is Tyrion (Peter D) going to do for the rest of the series after his unfortunate nose loss at Blackwater?Knowing how HBO has subtly changed some things to make characters more attractive or different, my guess is they will leave off the disfigurement of his nose and probably just give him a long scar or something less horrible looking. Which, if you think about it, changes the entire dynamics of how people treat Tyrion (not just a dwarf but a mutilated ugly one) for the rest of the series and dramatically changes how the books were written... such as how whores look away from his ugly face, and why he took up drinking more heavily... etc.
973	Aoife	2012-04-10	They might give him a scar, or they might just cover his nose in leather or similar "gold" to what they used for Viserys. Make it look like he has a gold nose made, as he 'jokes' with Varys.Westeros wouldn't have prosthetics as good as real-world ones (and have some more -- with before/after pictures -- because they're amazing, but a Lannister would be able to afford something if he wanted to.I don't know what the budget's like, nor what it takes to do CGI removal of facial features, but I think he's in too much for it to be done for every scene for the rest of the series. I figure they'll go with the scarring or the prosthetic look instead.
974	Lady Stormheart	2012-04-11	.  I imagined some slimy, creepy guy I did too. The only reason Arya trusted him later was because he killed the people on her list.  Anyway, I imagined him as the actor Crispin Glover. His role in Charlie's Angels kept popping up in my mind's eye.
975	Ser Sweets	2012-04-11	Other than the split hair (which would be nitpicking, imo), they pretty much got Jaquen exactly as I'd imagined him. There was a comment made about him being too attractive, but I always imagined Jaquen being a handsome man.Biter looked great, the only problem I had was Rorge having a nose. As it's been pointed out, it isn't a pivotal character trait, but it adds to the monstrousness of his character. I also feel that the world in ASoIaF should be brutal, mutilated and dark - Rorge's lack of a nose was a good example of that; more than taking away from his character, I feel it takes away from the brutality of the world a little bit.
976	boojam	2012-04-11	I would really like to know what kind of contract Tom Wlaschiha signed.
Just for one season?
I know , as a reader of the books, I have missed Jaqen for long time now, George has a great character there, and he does not die... but now off stage of a long time now (well a little blip there).
So , as we have wondered, what will D&D do?
977	lostinwesteros	2012-04-11	He looks brilliant. Not ridiculously extravagant and out of place, but handsome, enigmatic, sly and gritty.Perfect.Exactly!  I can't wait to see more of him, (and am curious to see a better view of red and white hair).  I also thought Rorge and Biter were perfect -- really scary!  They, along with the scene between Arya and Gendry - and Jon's scene w/ Craster and WW - were the best parts of the show!  /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />

978	Battlekitten	2012-04-11	I can't imagine it being that costly or hard to have managed the effect, practical or CGI.Biter was pretty good though.I am afraid it would be very tough using make up - perhaps a full face mask, 1/5 extra head size and then a missing nose and CGI would be expensive. These things add up  They could have given him a nasty on nose scar I guess
979	The Monkey	2012-04-11	I loved the way he laughed when Arya hit Biter/Rorge (how the hell do you know which is which at this point?) with her practice sword. Seems like a brilliant characterization.
980	Roboginger	2012-04-11	guess we won't see Tyrion lose his nose either.I kinda of hope we do see a Noseless Tyrion!  /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />
981	bloocanary	2012-04-11	Jaqen, IMO, is absolutely perfect in both mannerisms and appearance. I've seen a lot of comments that he's too handsome and not flamboyant enough (I assume this is in regards to the two-tone hair).
First, we need to remember that GRR's narrating from Arya's point of view and she's not too concerned with physical appearances of people so we typically only get stand-out features from her, if anything. Gendry's simply described in terms of his large size, Lommy and Hot Pie have zero physical descriptors because they're average boys, and Rorge and Biter are described in terms of their deformities. Jaqen's described as fine-featured and handsome; the "fine-featured" I'd take to mean almost pretty (as opposed to chiseled handsomeness; so more Loras than Jaime). That Arya takes notice of his attractiveness means it must stand out in some way (this might just be in contrast to his companions).
As for the hair, keep in mind that A. Again, this is Arya's POV so she's going to keep it simple. The shade of red is never specified (I think she describes Beric as having red hair as well, which seems to be interpreted as auburn by most readers). If it were Sansa talking about Jaqen, we'd probably get a lot more specifics (auburn hair, half of which was streaked with grey), but the only reason Arya bothers to comment on it at all is because it's two-toned (red on one side, white on the other).
And B. The poor guy's been in the black cells and riding in the back of a wagon in a cage that's exposed to all the dirt and filth kicked up on the road. His hair is filthy, so its color is probably subdued by that (and Arya does state that it's matted with dirt). I imagine that the color difference will be more noticeable after he cleans up (and so help me, HBO, if I've sat through 12+ episodes of tits and sexposition and you cut the bath scene, I'm going to drive to NYC and set the corporate office on fire).
982	bloocanary	2012-04-11	I loved the way he laughed when Arya hit Biter/Rorge (how the hell do you know which is which at this point?) with her practice sword. Seems like a brilliant characterization.I loved the laugh too! So perfect. He's completely unfazed by being locked up with a couple of lunatics, which makes him seem so much more dangerous and yet charming too.Rorge is the shouty one to Jaqen's left; Biter is behind him and doesn't talk. So Arya was swatting at Rorge. I agree, though...I didn't expect them to look so much alike. At the least, Biter should be bald. But then, their similarities in appearance could be a deliberate choice to make Jaqen stand out more to the viewer.

983	ipsuel	2012-04-11	He didn't have much of a screen time, but still, what do you think?Loved him. I love it when an actor underplays a character -- it comes off as more realistic to me, for some reason.
984	SerBronn	2012-04-11	Another reason why Jaqen may not have sounded liek Syrio is because Syrio is from Braavos and Jaqen is Norvosi I do believe.
985	Ferrum Aeternum	2012-04-11	Another reason why Jaqen may not have sounded liek Syrio is because Syrio is from Braavos and Jaqen is Norvosi I do believe.He's Lorathi.  He even mentions that to Arya in the scene before Rorge shouts him down with his demands for beer!

987	Ironpiper	2012-04-12	I was trying to explain Jaqen to a non reader friend who wanted spoilers but it was difficult.  In the books, we are introduced to the idea of FM before we meet Jaqen so we aren't totally thrown off when he reveals himself as such.  But in the show, they've not brought up anything about FM.  The whole FM concept is completely mysterious and somewhat confusing until Arya gets to the House of B&W and it would probably be doubly confusing to viewers.  So how would this work?I believe the concept of the FM was spoken of, when Robert was talking to Ned about getting rid of Dany. I will have to re-watch that episode but I think I'm correct.
988	kephv	2012-04-12	Not in the show they didn't. The only mention of the Faceless Men in the show comes from Doreah (during her scene with Viserys) and she doesn't say the name.
989	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-12	I believe the concept of the FM was spoken of, when Robert was talking to Ned about getting rid of Dany. I will have to re-watch that episode but I think I'm correct.Nope, FM wasn't brought up in the show during that particular scene, though, as someone pointed out upthread, Dorea mentioned a man changing his face.  I went back and rewatched that scene with her and Viserys and it's only about the face changing, nothing about how the face changer could be an assasin.
990	rmholt	2012-04-12	Well he's pretending to be Lorathi and as a professional assassin it would be a bit of a give away if he spoke with a Bravossi accent.Also spending the money on make-up to give a minor character no nose would hardly be productive and probably extremely uncomfortable for the actor.a little preview of how they will handle Tyrion - although they have prettied him up a lot anyway.
991	sarah.jenice	2012-04-12	Yeah I have to admit I expected a bit more of a "flamboyant" Jaqen, A  la Syrio. But I think it was okay.But his hair color split was barely noticable.I totally agree that I expected him to have more of an accent. Was his hair two different colors? I didn't see it at all.Even though I wasn't crazy about his accent (or lack of), I did like his accent. When Arya hits Rorge and Jaquen says "a boy has more courage than sense," it looked like he was really impressed with her. It will be nice to see him realize that she would be a good FM candidate through the show.
992	kungtotte	2012-04-12	You can tell Rorge and Biter apart because Biter has his teeth filed into sharp points. It is quite obvious when they show close-ups of him. Also he has close-cropped hair while Rorge has longer hair, and Biter tends to not talk.
And yes, Jaqen does indeed have red and white hair, though it is more like red hair with white "I shop at Hot Topic"-highlights than some kind of 50/50 split so it isn't extremely noticeable except in the close-ups.
993	boojam	2012-04-12	Even though I wasn't crazy about his accent (or lack of), I did like his accent. When Arya hits Rorge and Jaquen says "a boy has more courage than sense," it looked like he was really impressed with her. It will be nice to see him realize that she would be a good FM candidate through the show.I don't think 'realization' is part of it, the FM have had an eye on Arya for a while.It's my theory, from the books, that , that is the exact reason he has been sent to Westeros?Which presents us with a very interesting and as yet unresolved arc for Arya.
994	Iron Captain	2012-04-12	I thought it was a nice simple introducaiton.  He'll get more screentime next week with the lannister attack, and obviously more later in the season.  Do you guys think he might go ahead and explain to Arya that he is a faceless man, seeing as how it wasn't described last season?

Do you guys think he might go ahead and explain to Arya that he is a faceless man, seeing as how it wasn't described last season?I don't remember, and it's too hard to check, that Jaqen ever tells Arya that he is a FM.... tho somehow we readers know.Right before the Weasel Soup incident he reveals he knows , has known all along she is Arya Stark, George sort of slips that one in, very interesting!
996	boojam	2012-04-12	By the by , I have watched the Arya - Jaqen scene maybe 6 times now, and does he actually say "You are Arya"?
Or is that just his accent?
997	Iron Captain	2012-04-12	It's the accent, he is saying "arry"
998	bloocanary	2012-04-13	I don't remember, and it's too hard to check, that Jaqen ever tells Arya that he is a FM.... tho somehow we readers know.Right before the Weasel Soup incident he reveals he knows , has known all along she is Arya Stark, George sort of slips that one in, very interesting!As he's leaving he changes his face in front of her and tells her that it can be taught. That's when he gives her the coin and the words and tells her to head to Braavos if she wants to see him again. So, no, he never explicitly says he's a Faceless Man. I think we gather that from previous mention of them in the first book, where the council's discussing how to get rid of Daenerys. Pycelle mentions the Faceless Men as a solution.
999	Broken Fox	2012-04-13	This guy is perfect as Jaqen. Excellent casting.
1000	Free Northman	2012-04-13	I thought Jaqen was absolutely perfectly chosen. On another thread I mentioned how the actor portraying Balon was perhaps the most perfect adaptation yet.
But I had forgotten Jaqen's introduction in this episode. He looks so cool, confident, collected and totally in control of his little cage. The perfect assassin.
Kind of a Jason Bourne crossed with The Mentalist if I had to try and compare him to other TV characters.
For the record, I find many actors poor fits for their characters - like Davos, Cersei, Joffrey, Sansa the Tall, and even Mellisandre, who I imagined to have fuller lips and a less foxlike face, but Jaqen is absolutely perfect.

The perfect assassin.Ah, but as we have found out FM are more than just assassins , Jaqen (from the novel) already knows she is Arya Stark without being told. The work he pulls off for Arya seems more his evaluation of Arya than anything else. He provides the means for her to get to Braavos , but leaves it to her to carry out. Jaqen and his mission are onem of the most curious things George has introduced. It's a puzzle I hope George has a good tale for.

1002	Drinking Cersei's Tears	2012-04-13	By the by , I have watched the Arya - Jaqen scene maybe 6 times now, and does he actually say "You are Arya"?Or is that just his accent?She would have freaked out if he called her Arya.
1003	boojam	2012-04-14	She would have freaked out if he called her Arya.I'ts Wlaschiha strange accent. Notice the way he says 'companions'. (That not even a German accent.)
1004	Jaqen Hghar	2013-01-31	Even if this thread has been resting for a long time, now that Season 2 has finally started to air on Swedish national TV I cannot keep from commenting in a thread about "myself". Even if it pretty much only means agreeing with the majority - that it's a good cast of the character, and that I'll be thrilled to see the rest of the episodes. /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />
1005	teemo	2012-04-09	So I have several non book-reader friends that watch this show.  Maybe like 10.  I haven't talked to them all yet, but all of themI have talked to were really...bored.  Like super bored, to the point where many of them actually fell asleep.  I tell them it's just getting started and will speed up so they don't get discouraged.
It's funny some of the theories non book-readers come up with.  My friend is positive that Varys is not really a eunuch and him and Shae are about to start having an affair, just like he was so positive last week that Dany and Rahkaro were about to have an affair.  Another one of my friends thinks that ASHA (Yara, whatever) went too far with Theon and is probably an incest type of girl like Cersei. :\  What weird theories are your friends/family thinking up?

1006	CrypticWeirwood	2012-04-09	My friend is positive that Varys and Shae are about to start having an affair...If eunuchs had affairs, they wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be used as harem guards, now would they?
1007	teemo	2012-04-09	If eunuchs had affairs, they wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be used as harem guards, now would they?Oops - I should have put that in there, he doesn't think Varys is really a eunuch either.
1008	frametown	2012-04-09	I talked to a friend of mine after the first episode of this season.  She had watched the first season very recently so it was all fresh in her mind.  
She said she was thoroughly confused by the seven gods/idol burning scene, and was pretty thrown off for the rest of the episode.  
I think this season is going to be a tough one to pull off.
1009	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-04-09	One 32 year old woman coworker really loved the first episode, and although she hates Cersei she was enthralled with the Cersei/Petyr scene.
Another lady, a mom of a few kids of about 40 something is really confused.  She doesn't remember the references of Stannis in season 1 nor did she take much notice of Theon so I had to explain to her some of the details and then the concept grew on her at which point she said she should purchase the DVDs.  She really seems put off about the time Jon and the Night's Watch are spending at Crasters but her interest grew when I made her realize a White Walker was what took the baby at the end.  I also had to explain to her the the Night's Watch does not take sides.  She still does not know 90% of the character names since they are exotic and weird to her.  It's adorable really, I get a kick being her wiki, especially considering how little I know compared to you guys, but to her I'm the source.
I have another buddy who marathoned my boxset two weeks ago and has since read three quarters of CoK.  He really is not impressed with the second season at all.  The characters and storylines are fresh in his mind and he doesn't feel like the show comes anywhere close to the book and is being really negative about it.  I've created a monster elitist in that one.
1010	bloocanary	2012-04-09	Boyfriend is struggling a bit. He thinks that as things get more complicated, everyone will lose interest...I keep telling him things will pick back up once everyone new is introduced. He's terrible with names so he's assigned everyone nicknames. So far, he's managing to keep the following characters straight:
Triple H's Wife
Triple H's Son
Triple H's Bastard
The Fat One
Shakira
Charlton Heston
The Shitty Blond Kid
Future Assassin Girl
HillBilly Jim's Bastard
HillBilly Jim's Brother
HillBilly Jim's Gay Brother
The Whore That's In The Book
The Whore That's Not In The Book
The Eunich
Tommy Carcetti
Chris Jerico
Queen Gorgo
Tyrion
It helps when I have to explain something to him, although I feel remarkably silly saying things like, "Charlton Heston's in the desert with Shakira because Triple H exiled him for selling poachers to a slaver."
Oh, and he really likes Tyrion.

1011	teemo	2012-04-09	LOL.  My boyfriend has seen every episode of the first season several times and all of this season, and the only names he knows are Jon Snow, Tyrion, Ned (dead), Robert (dead and modern name), and Dany (only because we share the same name). He refers to Joffrey as "the little shithead."

As soon as that scene came on I noticed the icy crackling sounds, and the blue eyes of the Other. Also, it was way too big to be a wildling! But I guess I knew what to look/listen for.I hope they elaborate on it because I'd hate for HBO to make a change to the books in order to have more WW action, and people just think it's a boring wildling.

1017	Space Bandito	2012-04-09	Good thread. Pretty much all my non book friends want to be book friends (or they wouldn't be my friends) Many started the series after season one as well.  Those who have not made it through GOT yet are still obviously on team Stark (their favorite being Arya) but are starting to lean a little towards Tyrion at least. They are also horrible at names. Maybe if each episode was 2 hours long it would help. Yet as well all know there are more characters in the books. 
None have started season 2 yet. I was going to let 3 or 4 episodes build up and then have a few friends over and I can report more.

1019	Mrs.Stark	2012-04-10	My non-book reader friends liked the episode over all but did think there were some slow areas to it. Overall they enjoyed it and are looking forward to the next episode.

This is hilarious.  I love his names.  Especially Tommy Carcetti as it makes sense to name drop the mayor if you have no idea why they call him Littlefinger.  And of course, catching none of the names but understanding Tyrion because he's such a cool character.I never really thought about it, but there are resemblances to Triple H, Shakira, and Heston.
1021	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-10	I don't have any friends who watch the show and have also read the books so it's interesting getting their perspective.  Most everyone has liked the first two seasons.  The biggest confusion is the names of characters.  So many character names are never actually spoken on the show, which I guess makes sense because there are so many characters  names are given.  But it makes it confusing when I'm talking to them and I say, "Oh, wasn't Dolorous Edd just so damn funny!" and they are like, "Uh, who???"None of my friends realized it was a white walker who took the baby.  The flash of the blue eyes was too fast.  They think that White Walkers and wildlings and wights are the same thing and are very confused about why Osha is called a wildling when she doesn't have eerie blue eyes or act like a total zombie.
1022	The Last Dragon	2012-04-10	Half of my friends started reading the books after my year long propaganda program. Thinks most of them started just to get me of their backs. They love the books though. And loved both of the episodes, even the non-reading friends. They focus on different things than I do. Some need some extra explanation on Stannis and Gendry. But most of them know this is a show that requires attention and that not everything is explained right away. So they just enjoy the ride.

1023	the hound of sansa	2012-04-10	i have only non reader friends. they succumbed to my will and watched the show. most of them finished it in just 2 days! now i have the satisfaction of telling them "i told you so" all the time, cause they didnt believe me it was that good!
as for season 2, i haven't heard any complaints, they still find it exciting. they somehow all fallen in love with tyrion (no surprise there). as for the last scene of episode 2, i think it was pretty obvious for them ,it was a white walker. they saw the blue eyes and understood immediately.
1024	girlfrommonday	2012-04-10	my sister had no problem with identification of the White Walker, but in her dictionary they are referred as 'Predators' /shocked.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':shocked:' />
1025	Isis	2012-04-10	I don't think Sean Bean looks  that much like Triple H. Why not just call him Sean Bean. Or Boromir.
1026	Greywolf2375	2012-04-10	My wife has read the books, but really doesn't remember a whole lot of it and is having a hard time following the story.  The opening on Dragonstone really threw her - she thought initially they were doing something at the Wall..
Having Joffrey be responsible for the bastards being killed didn't make sense to her - "what does he care?"
1027	Independent George	2012-04-10	I don't think Sean Bean looks  that much like Triple H. Why not just call him Sean Bean. Or Boromir.Or, better yet - Mr. Bean.
1028	waaimasjien	2012-04-10	I really don't see how my boyfriend could possibly enjoy the show, since the main thing that keeps him busy is 'who the hell are they talking about?' Who's Robb? And who is that new bearded guy? Stannis? Whut? And why did the Lord Commander just bash Snowy in the head?
1029	Loras	2012-04-10	My partner really enjoys the show.  He was thrown off by little things like Melisandre in the first episode, but otherwise he is loving it.  Again he did have some trouble with the White Walkers but I am expecting that to be explained in the next episode anyway.
He actually made some very astute observations - particularly about the bastard killing.  He asked whether a 'civil war' was going to start because the stupid Lannister's had killed their own people.
Most importantly he really appreciated the new scene with Littlefinger and Ros.  He commented that he didn't think that Littlefinger was that "nasty".  So I guess, for me, that the brothel scene had the desired intention!
1030	Brienne the Beauty	2012-04-10	My husband follows maybe half of it. He confused Yoren with Bronn and couldn't figure out why one guy was simultaneously on the run from the city watch and commander of the city watch!
He also forgets who Theon is every time he sees him.

Sunday's episode must have been harder for him because I kept yelling "that is not the way it happened in the book!"

1036	Nymeria44	2012-04-10	My husband loves season 1 but he found this episode a little slow until Jon saw the White Walker. He even felt sympathy for Theon not fitting in with his family or the Starks. I had to remain expressionless when he commented that Theon better not screw over Robb.

1038	Dragon greyscale	2012-04-10	It's interesting, going through this board it's clear that many non-readers are confused and struggle to keep up yet on other boards many purists complain that HBO is dumbing the show down too much. Contradicion much?
 I just think it shows the difficulty of adaptation and the differences in the medium. For me, it makes D&D's so-called "controversial" decisions a lot more understandable. If anything, they need to trim the story even more, especially post-aSoS.
1039	Lord Hodor	2012-04-10	My Dad loved the first episode, though complained about the lack of continuity. Changing locations back and foward every 5 minutes can get confusing.
For this one, he didnt like so much. The break of pace on the constant POV switching proved too much for him, he was throughly lost by mid-episode.
1040	genegirl	2012-04-10	My husband is having a hard time keeping track of the characters and seemed rather annoyed that I already knew some of the individuals before their names were mentioned.  My daughter, however just finished A CLASH OF KINGS so she is right in step.  Unfortunately she has just started A STORM OF SWORDS,  I just want to be able to talk to her about The Red Wedding.
1041	Crown	2012-04-10	All of my friends, and mother, are loving it. Have to explain some minor things, tho'. Haven't heard any awkward theories yet, they just want Joffry to die.
1042	FloredaA	2012-04-10	I'm looking the show with my husband, who's not that much into it, and keeps asking "who's this guy again?"  I am much frustrated that the one person I know who shares my tastes is my 14 yo daughter, and she won't be watching the series before a few years!
The french translation (we're french) is so lame and aggravating I managed to talk her into reading the books in english. That's the first book she tries in english, she's now on page 71 of Game of Thrones and very proud and excited. She does ask for a translation of a few words per page !
1043	shadow of death	2012-04-10	Most non readers i know are confused by the characters.  They need a cheat sheet.  None of them have any clue about any of the little mysteries like who Jon Snow's parents are.

1044	Hyper	2012-04-10	What I would find more interesting is reading direct opinions from non-readers. Not reports filtered through the biases (conscious or not) of readers of this site.
There is a well known phenomenon that can be described by two people in an audience reviewing an event:
 - Person A (who enjoyed the event) states that everyone was enthusiastic
 - Person B (who did not enjoy the event) states that the event felt flat, with little enthusiasm from everyone
Who is right? Both? Neither? It's all based on confirmation bias.
1045	Purah	2012-04-10	Both of my friends are really into the series but do get a little confused by the all the characters, the backstory to the plot and the world in general. When introducing someone to the series, I have to spend a good five or ten minutes explaining Robert's Rebellion to them. I also find it really hard not to spoil events (I kind of let slip about LF's uh...involvement in the whole shiz-bang should we say), because they always ask for an explanation whenever I offhandedly say "ooh that wasn't in the book".
I suppose looking at it from their perspective, D&D's little alterations do make sense in helping 'The Unsullied' to understand things, but some things still bring out the purist in me /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' /> I guess it can't really be helped haha
1046	Gertrude	2012-04-10	There is a forum on Television Without Pity for Game of Thrones. ONe of those threads is for unspoiled speculation. The people posting here are very vigilant about avoiding any type of spoilers, including the book, obviously. They don't even allow for people who have read Game of Thrones after the first season since it would have more information that what we are shown. You can find it here. This thread starts with season one, but season two starts up about 154 (around there anyway). I find it fascinating to see how others see it and what they pick up. Robb is definitely in the 'dead pool', but most think it will happen this season.
1047	Caro99	2012-04-10	i had my mum thinking back in S1 when king robert is telling his council he wants daenerys dead that Danny would manage to get to Westeros before the end of the season and robert would fall madly in love with her. i only laughed and said that it was a posibility but knowing robert's hatred for targaryens i knew it was impossible. but then it left me thinking- robert loves pretty young women, so what would happen if the most beautiful woman in the world according to many came along..?

1048	Dolorous Eddie	2012-04-10	Most people I know haven't read the books. They actually tell me they don't want to read them because it will "spoil" the show for them. Ah well... I've convinced a couple to pick them up, though.
Anyway, I was surprised a lot of people told me they find most of the episodes boring. Those who watched season 1 are completely "Team Stark" and think of everyone else as black and white villains. They are always amazed when I say Jaime is one of my favourite characters, and I can't really give them my reasons...
Robb Stark is, without exception, their favourite character, closely followed by Dany.  They all loathe Sansa and see Tyrion as some sort of minor character put there for comic relief. They only remember the "main" characters' names and everyone else is given nicknames. Joffrey is universally known as Draco Malfoy v2.0.
The most difficult part for me is that I have to listen to their theories on who's gonna die and etc. and cannot correct them!
1049	Rob the God	2012-04-10	Friend of mine loved the first 2 episodes.
Was totally psyched by the theon and tyrion scenes
But didn't understand everything about Stannis (thought they were sitting in a tent when Stannis&CO. were at Dragonstone)
He is also afraid of not getting all the small things (like the thging about davos fingers) and wants to buy the books now
So well decide yourself if that's a good or a bad thing for the show;)
1050	int11	2012-04-10	Show your friends some character and house features etc before the episode starts.
These are also good:

1051	the maid of woodlynne	2012-04-10	My coworkers are watching, but only one of them has attempted reading along. And none of my friends are big readers, so no one is on board. /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' /> Every monday I put on my Westerosi Ambassador hat and play the "in the book/not in the book" game. I'll admit, it is fun yet challenging to find a way to answer their questions without spoiling stuff...
For the most part, they're following along - keeping names straight - but they're seriously sick of the sexposition.
1052	boojam	2012-04-10	I and my wife are older than the usual viewer.
I am a long time reader of science fiction and some fantasy, fantasy like Tolkien or Twilight Zone style fantasy.
Our in laws are very avid readers of history, fiction, non-fiction, not fantasy readers at all.
They don't get HBO but got the DVDs of GOT and loved it!
We have HBO on demand so was able to show them 201, they think it's some of the best TV they have ever seen, the believe the actors are of the highest caliber.
1053	ti_ana	2012-04-10	My fiance hasn't read the books (although he did listen to the last half of the Game of Thrones audiobook with me on a long car ride when I decided it was time for a reread), but he's really enjoying the show. It's interesting to watch it with him and hear what he thinks is going to happen. I feel bad because I point out who characters are sometimes before their names are mentioned and I feel like I'm ruining it for him. He's a good sport, though, and doesn't seem annoyed yet! Haha. It was very interesting to watch his reaction when Ned got beheaded!
Last episode, he (correctly) predicted that Tywin's going to die and all hell is going to break lose because of it. Obviously, I didn't confirm either way, but I bet he'll be shocked when he eventually finds out who kills him.
I also got my brother to start watching and he's been into it as well. When I asked him what he thought about Ned's death, since I remember a lot of fans who hadn't read the books were shocked that what was perceived as the main character could be killed off, my brother shrugged and said, "Well, he wasn't the main character!" Love it. He did go ahead and start on the book series. I'm excited about that.
1054	CrypticWeirwood	2012-04-10	Funny but I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t seem to have any non-booker friends who follow the series.  Even my folks and siblings have read the books.
1055	GSP	2012-04-10	I only had one friend who was watching the show and hadn't watched the books. He promptly started reading the series about halfway into season 1 and is now frustratedly waiting for TWOW with the rest of us.
His family, none of whome have read the books, love the show and are probably enjoying it more than myself without the internal 'why the hell did they make that change?' monologue. (I do really enjoy the show but I know for a certain I'd like it more if I could just stop comparing it to the books).
1056	turdle	2012-04-10	the people i've shown all really liked the first season, i'm not entirely sure how they feel about the first two episodes of this season, but i think for the most part they're enjoying it.  they were a little confused about dragonstone, i clarified as much as needed.  i'm not sure how, but my friend thought the girl that theon is fucking on the boat was osha. he also thought the whitewalker was a wight, which is more understandable. i really don't know why non-readers would think it was a wildling, unless they just think wildlings are whitewalkers. it clearly had bright blue eyes, and made the same sounds as the whitewalker from season 1.
1057	N. Baratheon	2012-04-10	I don't think Sean Bean looks  that much like Triple H. Why not just call him Sean Bean. Or Boromir.I actually wind up calling Ned "Sean Bean" or "Boromir" in conversation, but then I think of Ned as "Trevelyan""For Westeros, Robert?""No. For me."
1058	flame7926	2012-04-10	My dad liked the first episode, but didn't like the most recent one, too much build up, not enough action. It did seem dull to me too, maybe 5 not connected events, two sex scenes, nothing advancing the plot too much.
1059	Lady Stormheart	2012-04-11	They think this is the best show ever. I watched the first season first and when the show ended I started on the books. So now having read all the books before the second season, I am dissapoint. I mean, the sets are lovely and the cast is awesome. Some discrepencies I did not like but I suppose fit in the show...like, Bronn become the King's guard or Gentry finding out about Arya in 3 minutes. Also, what is Melisandre and this son? Wut.
Other than those things and Peter Dinklage being rather stiff. I love the show:) lol
1060	Mista C	2012-04-11	A friend of mine at work who hasn't read the books was a little confused about Theon.  He didn't know that he was a ward of the Starks for all these years; he just thought that Theon was gone on his own will.  He also was a little confused about who Melisandre is and why they were burning the idols, but he figured it out enough to not be lost.  I love that I fall into the "book reader" camp this year, as opposed to last year when I was not.  I like filling-in things for my non-book reading friends... so on monday's now I put together an e-mail with things that were different in the show compared to the book and I send it to my friends... they love it.
1061	Morky_Pep	2012-04-11	This is a show where you have to actually pay attention. This is not 90210, you have to actually make connections to understand whats going on and thats what makes this show like nothing else on television. What makes it brilliant is that you can watch throughout the season once and get the main plot points and be shocked by the huge developments, and then you can rewatch it again and again and pick out the multitude of details that you missed the first time.
Thats what I did with season 1, i watched the first 3 episodes in one day and was totally flimsy on what was actually going on, but I knew that I loved it, so I finished the season, rewatched it , then started the books. Casual viewers went through the same things; when they watched the first season, they were somewhat confused; who are these people? what is the society like? who am i interested in? Then they got used to it and started to enjoy their favorite characters. Now when you watch a second season of a show, you expect your need to pay attention to decline because well youve already gotten used to the idea and feel of the show(take walking dead for instance, all you need to know for the second season is there is zombie apocolypse and ricks wife cheated on him with his best friend when she thought he was dead), and tjhis isnt the same for GOT. Season two is like watching a new series. The feel has changed from the first season, there is a  plethora of new characters, and this confuses and scares people because they are not accustomed to it. My belief is that as the season rolls on and they start to get used to theon, stannis, and davos as being main characters they will start to enjoy it much more jsut like season one.
The same is with the books really. I;ve read other series like wheel of time, whewre after you get the feel for the characters from the first book, its just a breeze read through the next ones. With each ASOIAF book, you have to approach it like a new series, and focus and remember who people are, and this may put off some readers, but for me I love it. It is what seperates it from so many other series. You can read them again and catch all the subtle things(frey pies, the clues that bran actually isnt dead, the stinky steward ect), unless you visit sites liek these where people catch them and post them for you.
It is this reasoning that this is the best show ever. It may not be perfect in its adaptation but it does a pretty good job with the scope. I think that people will watch the season, skim the surface, see some crazy sh*t and then be like wow that was awesome, I didnt fully get it, but was awesome, im going to watch it again.
1062	Ferrum Aeternum	2012-04-11	My mom and brother-in-law are still 100% into it and are excited about where the show appears to be going.  It helps that both of them have book readers (dad and sister) to help them along with some of the details, especially the new characters.
1063	Slingingstones	2012-04-11	I've read the books and both my lady friend and I have watched the HBO series.  We're both septuagenarians and as you might imagine, have enjoyed all types of movies for many years.  This series is Ivanhoe for adults.  We love the adaptation.  Had to re-view the last Jon Snow scene on HBO GO several times to see the WW's blue eye to prove to her it was indeed a WW and not a wildling.  
She's somewhat familiar with the story, hearing me relate the back-story of what was cut to allow the progress of the video to fit an hour episode.  I'm pleased with how they've made the transition.  Nothing in our real lives ever follows the script perfectly. We all cope by adapting to the situation.
1064	Isabella Stark	2012-04-11	Non-reader friend # 1: Was holding off reading the books because she knew how frustrated the rest of us were with the wait for the series to end.  Last year, she watched with me. After making it to episode 4, she was so hooked on the story that she couldn't resist reading the books.
Non-reader friend # 2: Watched the first 4 episodes last year, found it confusing but was mildly positive. Then got busy and couldn't keep coming over to watch it with us.  Last month, she borrowed by DVD's and watched season 1.  She really enjoyed it!  She was particularly enthusiastic about the credits, which she said were really valuable in orienting her in each episode.  She's a big fan of British pop culture and is a walking encyclopedia of British actors; so part of her enjoyment is in seeing all these wonderful British actors. 
She made her boyfriend watch the first 2 episodes of season 1 with her.  He's not a big fantasy fan and said it reminded him of one big Led Zeppelin video; but did acknowledge that it seemed well done.
Non-reader friend # 3: Says it's a "great show." We haven't really discussed plot details so far this season.  He found it useful to watch this season's episode 1 twice. 
This friend has always advocated for watching the movie (or tv show) before reading the book it's based on.  His theory is that you can enjoy the movie/ tv show, without being distracted by departures from the book; and then read the book, which will be better, and enjoy it as well.
1065	dansnow	2012-04-11	My cousin enjoys them a lot and refuses to "spoil the show" by reading the books as well. She doesn't remember most of the character names and thinks all houses other than Stark, Lannister and Baratheon are minor (including Arryn, Tyrell, Targaryen etc). She is also convinced Jon is Roberts bastard because they kept mentioning they are brown haired. She says it's poor writing because it is so obvious /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' /> /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' />

1066	Areo Speedwagon	2012-04-11	I watch it weekly with one fellow reader and one non-reader.  The reader and I are pretty much on the same page in regards to the changes.  Some we like better than others, but we understand that a tv show is a tv show and a book is a book and we try to enjoy them as their own mediums of delivering this massive story.
That being said, the non-reader is keeping up very well.  Last episode, he paused it twice, once with a small question about Theon, which, while I can't remember exactly what it was, it was about his backstory.  Regardless, it wasn't a major source of confusion.
The second time he paused was when Dany was examining the severed head that got sent back to them by Khal Jhago or Pono.  He paused, smiled, looked at both of us and asked "How epic do they get?"  I said "What do you mean?"  He said "I mean, they have dragons.  They're small now but they're going to get bigger.  And shit literally can't get worse for them.  They have no where to go but up.  So I'm thinking shit gets crazy with them.  It HAS to."    My other friend and I just smiled (All I could think of was SPOILER AHEAD: Dany riding in between the rows of Unsullied then yelling Dracarys!).  We told him he's right but don't want to say anything else.  He is very excited to see where Dany's story is going as he rightly said They can only go up.
Glad to say he knew it was White Walkers taking the baby.  He liked that too.  He was wondering about them since they opened the series, yet we haven't seen them since.  Personally, I think they should have stopped with Jon hearing them.  Kudos to the sound department on the White Walker communication sounds!  I thought they were perfect.  But yeah, I think they should have left it at that.  But, my friend who hasn't read the books really liked seeing them, being reminded they're still out there.
1067	teemo	2012-04-11	My cousin enjoys them a lot and refuses to "spoil the show" by reading the books as well. She doesn't remember most of the character names and thinks all houses other than Stark, Lannister and Baratheon are minor (including Arryn, Tyrell, Targaryen etc).

She says it's poor writing because it is so obvious /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' /> /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' />LOL.  Those brown-haired people...but at least your cousin is on to something with Jon's questionable parentage.  My doctor told me she thought that Lyanna and Rhaegar were Jon's parents, and she has never read the books, which kind of shocked me.  And she gave me the whole, "Don't spoil the show!"  for me thing too.....
1068	TMWNN	2012-04-11	My doctor told me she thought that Lyanna and Rhaegar were Jon's parents, and she has never read the books, which kind of shocked me.This is why, as cool as it would have been to see, there was no need for a Tower of Joy flashback scene. Everything needed for today's Lost-trained TV audience to figure out Jon's likely parentage is within the first two episodes of season one, and the evidence is easier to find than within the pages of a 1,000-page book.
1069	dreamcatcher	2012-04-11	My mum doesn't know what the hell is going on, but she "likes it". I had to explain to her what is happening and she said, "Oh." I don't think she got it.
My best friend understands the show and LOVES it, especially Cersei, also can't wait to see Natalie Dormer.
1070	zippypoodle	2012-04-12	So I have several non book-reader friends that watch this show.  Maybe like 10.  I haven't talked to them all yet, but all of themI have talked to were really...bored.  Like super bored, to the point where many of them actually fell asleep.  I tell them it's just getting started and will speed up so they don't get discouraged.I've generally found that boredom says more about the person that it does about what the person is viewing/reading/etc.  Not always, but often.
1071	Hear Us Roar	2012-04-12	I tell them to spend a a few minutes reading the wiki.
I don't spoil a damn thing
1072	jons nissa	2012-04-12	i have a non-reader friend who's been watching since the first episode season 1. he loves series like this and was addicted to "the wire" and "the borgias". i think those shows prepared him well because he catches damn near everything!
in season 1, he told me the "whore gate" scene with littlefinger telling ros how to have sex with a patron sent the signal loud and clear that littlefinger was going to "screw" ned. he also said that tywin being shown dressing his own kill - which he noted was a stag - was a sign that tywin was a no nonesense kind of guy that didn't mind getting his hands dirty by doing the tough jobs himself.
i was dumbstruck. "really? you got that from that scene?"
but he's not always right. he took the scene between cersei and littlefinger in ep 1 season 2 to mean that cersei had the upper hand when it comes to her enemies. (smirk) he redeemed himself though by saying that the sex scene with stannis and melisandre showed pieces falling off the table. he thinks the duo is going to take down key players.
but he has some wrong ideas, not because he isn't reading them well but that there isn't enough backstory or time spent on them. he thinks melisandre is a religious fanatic (with no power) because she was introduced burning religious statues. he also thought mance rayder took craster's baby since they'd been talking about the wildings.
i'm still surprised he's doing so well. i always expect him to complain that things are going too fast but he thinks the pace is fine. i did tell him to look out for season 3 though. i told him it would rock his world. which he is taking to mean that great things will happen because of the sexual innuendo of that saying. poor guy. /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />
he wants to read the books now but says he doesn't have the time for such large tomes. last season though, he said he didn't want to spoil the show.
1073	teemo	2012-04-12	I've generally found that boredom says more about the person that it does about what the person is viewing/reading/etc.  Not always, but often.Well, I think the super gratuitous sex scenes are actually a turn-off for some people.  My boyfriend thinks it's just a medieval soap-opera and he loses respect for the show with the gratuity.  I think he's under the impression that my books are full of sex and love stories, when those types of scenes are actually quite rare.  I guess I can see how some people see it as a soap opera with how fast everything moves and sex and nudity everyone.  I don't know.  I wish he didn't hate it so much! /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />

1074	Mendoza	2012-04-12	My brother, a non-book reader, loves Stannis just for how blunt is regarding the line about his beloved brother Robert.  He actually saw episode1 before me and was repeating the line to me, "He wasn't my beloved brother. I didn't love him and he didn't love me."  He also, for the longest time, hated the Imp, just for being too over the top, but now he says the character is growing on him.  He is also sure that King Joffrey "will get his" eventually.
1075	Gertrude	2012-04-13	This is why, as cool as it would have been to see, there was no need for a Tower of Joy flashback scene. Everything needed for today's Lost-trained TV audience to figure out Jon's likely parentage is within the first two episodes of season one, and the evidence is easier to find than within the pages of a 1,000-page book.On another forum (the unspoiled one) several people think this, too. Their biggest proof is Ned telling Jon that 'he may not have his name, but he has his blood' - he didn't say, 'you are my son'. Not everyone is convinced, but it comes up quite a bit. A lot of people also think that he can't be a Targ because he burnt his hand when he threw the lantern on the wight. Then again, not everyone here is convinced of R+L+J so that sounds about right.I also wanted to post this quote from there because it amused me. The conversation seems to have come back around to who send the assassin for Bran. (Littlefinger is a popular suspect, but most think it's Joff. The motivation is to frame Tyrion to get him back for bitch-slapping him.)Anyone want to bet it was ROBERT'S dagger? You know, like he got gifted a while back? Which was just lying in a chest?Were does THAT come from? Why would it be Robert's dagger? Why would he bring it to Winterfell? Why would the assassin use it? Can you elaborate?

1076	Gogossos	2012-04-13	A friend thinks Dany is immortal.
1077	_Oberyn_	2012-04-13	My borther loves the show but he does not seem to be bothered about where its going since he knows about the number of books and after Neds death he figured everything that happens now is very volatile. So his enjoying every episode on its own merits rather then try to make prediction, though he guessed what Balon wants. I cant wait to see his reaction to the RW though, i dont think he will see that coming.
1078	Abifer	2012-04-13	Most of my friends who watch the TV show haven't read the books and they're loving it so far, it's different watching the second series for me as I hadn't read the books until after the first series.  Unsurprisingly, the most comments from my non-reading friends are related to the sexual content though it certainly hasn't impaired their enjoyment as a whole!
1079	birdsong66	2012-04-13	I watch with a group of people who have read, and people who have only seen season one.  Here's what I'm getting:1)  Quite a few readers are frustrated with the changes in characters for the HBO series.2)  We readers had to explain that Melisandre is not that "bald guy's wife," and that his name is Stannis, who they heard about in season one.3)  This was the funniest observation to me:  "Robb is a lot taller....must have found a soapbox."  Which, I'm sorry, but ROTFL.Overall, it seems to help the non-readers to have readers in the room to answer questions, or they give that impression at least.
1080	howland_reed	2012-04-13	My borther loves the show but he does not seem to be bothered about where its going since he knows about the number of books and after Neds death he figured everything that happens now is very volatile. So his enjoying every episode on its own merits rather then try to make prediction, though he guessed what Balon wants. I cant wait to see his reaction to the RW though, i dont think he will see that coming.In all honesty, RW is VERY predictable.  It's just that we as readers so did not want it to happen, that we're shocked as usual that our protagonists/heroes could not escape.  I mean as soon as Robb came back with Jeyne Westerling and threw away his promise to the Freys, you knew something bad was going to happen.  Then you have Greywind being chained up outside...its like we blind ourselves to what is inevitable because we expect the protagonists in a work of fiction to always find a way out.  I think non-readers are already setting themselves up that anything can happen, including Robb's death.I think what was more surprising in ASOS was actually Oberyn dying.  I thought for sure he was going to kick Gregor's ass and Tyrion would win another trial by combat.

I thought for sure he was going to kick Gregor's ass and Tyrion would win another trial by combat.I agree that is predictable, it was for me because ASOS was the first book in the series i read and since i had no real attachment to Robb as a character it was obvious to me what was happeing. But i think after two and a half seasons even non-readers might think some some characters are too important/well liked/central to the plot to kill.
1082	TC_Chaos	2012-04-14	After going through all the comments, I think the most unified thing about non-readers is they do not want to read the books for it will ruin the show for them. One of my friends said the same thing to me when I was reading ADWD. He said, "Why would you want to ruin season 5 or 6 for yourself?" The other thing is that non-readers are seriously confused about many things. With this, its pretty obvious. First of all, with the mythology of ASOIAF, how can everything be explained on screen. I remember reading book 1 and was confused as hell, and that was from actually reading the text clearly with words.
As for the new season, the religions are going to be tough for people to digest. First of, I'm not even sure non-readers even know the two distinctions between the old god and the new from season 1. Second, every faction has their own religion. The thing with the Sevens from season 1 was they didn't explained or show who the fuck are the Sevens. Everyone know the old god because Sean Bean was sitting in front of the weirwood. And with Stannis' burning the Sevens, I'm sure non-readers don't know it was the statues of the Sevens he was burning. On top of not explaining the Sevens and the Red God, now they have to introduce the Drowned God next, LOL.
This season is going to be tough on non-readers because there is no major plot twists like season 1. Many are complaining the show is getting boring and it's a legit remark. I felt that ACOK has the best introduction to any book. By saying that I mean how all the Kings and Queen saw the red comet and declared outright it was their sign to rise and take the crown. When they showed the red comet and linked it to the dragons without any interpretation by any King or Queen, I felt they did the book wrong (very wrong). Again, for us readers, we must view this show as an interpretation and not a photocopy of the book.
Going forward, the one thing I really held dear to me was Battle of BW. I won't be too negative about this one just yet. We'll see how the season pan out.
1083	The Thin White Line	2012-04-14	I watched the first season alone, and hadn't read the books at that time (never even heard of them). As I became a total fanatic of the series, I now invite a group of 8 friends to watch it every sunday. 4 of them are avid book readers, 4 only watch the HBO material.
My opinion so far of Season 2 is that it doesn't quite move me as much as the first season. Too many unnecessary sex scenes, too many unimaginative conversation scenes in terms of filmmaking, a general lack of coherence. I'm pretty sure though that they're saving their budget for later in the season. They're just putting things into place at this point. My reader friends have the same opinion : they like it, but aren't enthusiastic. My non-reader friends are confused. They are sceptic for now. No one remembered who Theon was, no one remembered who Stannis was, and everybody was baffled after the Dragonstone scene. Yet, we're hanging on !
1084	Ser Chuck	2012-04-15	I was actually the one calling my non-reading friends in confusion last week. "Rakharo's not dead! He's in book five!" I don't know where they are going with that. 
As for my friends no one seems to be having much trouble following along with me as a personal wiki that is willing to draw up maps and family trees on a whim. For the 13th straight episode I anticipate them all demanding Joffrey's head as they've done that consistently since day one. I've heard none of this reported confusion over Theon or the fate of Craster's son.
1085	lojzelote	2012-04-15	Reading this thread was almost physically painful. LOLLuckily for me, all my relatives and friends either donÂ´t know aSoIaF/GoT exist, or they read the books, too. IÂ´m so glad. I wouldnÂ´t be able to take it if they came up with some things I have read here. Seriously, from what IÂ´ve seen I just canÂ´t get why they even watch the show if they donÂ´t know whatË<U+0087>t going on at all.I have different problem: My friends read the books in our mother tongue, but I read them in English. Therefore when we talk about them, I donÂ´t know how the names are translated.
1086	Lyana	2012-04-17	I watched the first season without having read the books and I thought the show was great. I understood almost everything but when I started to read the books after that, I realized how much there was going on under the surface.
But now, when the second season started, I catch myself overthinking every single scene and being way too critical. I really try to seperate the books from the show and yet I find the second season also great.
None of my friends is a book reader, but I convinced my boyfriend and a colleague from work to watch the show.
They both were doing pretty well with the first season (didn't catch the small hints of Jon's parentage). But the scenes with Melisandre and burning the Seven in the second season confused them both and I had to explain everything.
My boyfriend knew immediately that the WW took Craster's son and is doing quite well so far. I have to explain some small things, but I think that is just me and I'm doing it without him even asking /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
My colleague on the other hand, asked me a bunch of questions about the second season. I had to explain all about the Seven and the new God - The Lord ot Light (can't spell the name), also about Maester Cressen and Davos and his fingers. He thought that in the scene with Davos and S. Saan, Davos was Stannis and the son of Davos was Renly. So I had to explain all that too. He also didn't get that the WW took the baby. But apart from that, he loves the show and we are discussing it every day at work /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
I enjoy being the wiki for non-book readers. Can't wait to see the third episode tonight (I'm a bit late but couldn't catch the show yestarday).
1087	Mendoza	2012-04-21	There is one thing my brother did get confused by in season one.  He thought Cersei was sleeping with Ser Loras.  He missed that he had fled the city with Renly Baratheon and didn't catch on that Lancel is a different character.
1088	Top Notch Balanter	2012-04-21	Well people who have seen the a good bit of the 1st season are annoyed about Sean Bean being killed yet again but enjoy it. A friend of mine who has no interest in fantasy at all watched a couple minutes of a season 1 episode and a few adds was very confused for instance he seemed to think that Tyrion was hitting on Cersei. He only knew a couple of people in the cast like Sean Bean and John Boy Power
He also described a scene to me which i can't really remember so i was wondering if yous know what scene it was. He said that there were two people walking in a city one was in his mid 20s and the other was around 50 and looked a little like Liam Neeson they went into a building but were then attacked and thats all he told me.
1089	brena	2012-04-21	I've read the books but my husband hasn't. I find it fascinating to watch the shows with him and note his reactions! It's worth mentionning that we like and watch weird stuff, so my husband doesn't have too much difficulty not having everything spelled out. However, he's awful with remembering names.. Also, we went throught season I again quite recently, so he still has everything fresh in mind.- As soon as Gilly refused to say what happens to baby boys, my husband said "he sacrifices them to the White Walkers! Or maybe they eat them..."- When we saw Craster leave into the woods with the baby, he went "White Walkers it is! So THAT's why they're safe in the woods and don't get attacked!"- He understood the burning scene was something deeply meaningful, but he didn't understand what they were burning. I had to point out they were burning seven statues, with emphasis on "seven" and he went ".....?.... OOOOOohhhhhhhhh! Seven statues like in "by the seven gods"?- He didn't remember who Stannis was at all. But caught up quickly when he talked about "his beloved brother Robert". He was also stunned by Stannis's "a lie! Take it out" and insistence on calling SER Jaime the KINGSLAYER. His jaw dropped and he went "he's... he's... he doesn't mess around, does he? He can't be king! THAT'S who Ned wanted as king?!?"- He understood Theon's storyline perfectly and was really impressed by how dramatic it all was.- He loved Yara! I did too! Before she even opened her mouth, he said she was a badass pirate. On their way to Pyke, he kept asking when was she going to make Theon eat his own boots. Later on, he kept saying how awesome she was.in season 1, he told me the "whore gate" scene with littlefinger telling ros how to have sex with a patron sent the signal loud and clear that littlefinger was going to "screw" ned. he also said that tywin being shown dressing his own kill - which he noted was a stag - was a sign that tywin was a no nonesense kind of guy that didn't mind getting his hands dirty by doing the tough jobs himself.[..]but he has some wrong ideas, not because he isn't reading them well but that there isn't enough backstory or time spent on them. he thinks melisandre is a religious fanatic (with no power) because she was introduced burning religious statues.He's pretty observant!My husband got the whore gate's meaning too. Actually, he was mostly laughing and suddenly went "wait.. WHAT? He's talking about Catelyn! Oh no, he's going to betray Ned!"He also found Tywin very impressing and got the same no-screwing-around vibe. He commented something like "so... that's why the Lannisters are all screwed up..."About Melisandre, I read the books and I too see her as a religious fanatic. However, with the cup scene, my husband turned to me and said "sooooo... can't be killed with poison, uh?".There is one thing my brother did get confused by in season one.  He thought Cersei was sleeping with Ser Loras.  He missed that he had fled the city with Renly Baratheon and didn't catch on that Lancel is a different character.Yeah, my husband mixed them up too at first. He went "what? he's not gay? *pause, rewind, squint at the screen* Oh, that's the funny-hat guy... "I think it's mostly because they have the same wig and because of the lighting in Lancel's scene with Cercei, he doesn't look as blond as in his other scenes. Plus his usual silly hat is kind of distinctive.
1090	BaleriOne	2012-07-09	If eunuchs had affairs, they wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be used as harem guards, now would they?Varys apparently hired Shae from the beginning - the ultimate Spy
1091	Sheena	2012-07-09	I only have one friend who watches the series. She only started because I raved about it and the books, and her boyfriend started reading the series. He didn't want to watch futher than he had read so it was slow-going for my friend at first. Eventually they just wanted to know what happened and watched both seasons in a very short amount of time. Now he doesn't feel a desire to read further, which is the same situation as another friend's boyfriend. I'll force them to do it though.
Anyway, my friend LOVES it. She kept telling me the parts that she was at, doting upon the Dany/Drogo relationship then being heartbroken at its turn-out. She hasn't told me any theories that she has. I've told her some non-spoiler theories that I've read on here and I've told her some vague things about Dany's future so that she'd be somewhat happy. She's still devastated about Drogo.
Edit: Also, I began watching the series before I knew about the books, then I read them. However, prior to the book-readin', when Ned went to see Gendry, I thought that Gendry was the trueborn son of Robert and Cersei, but Cersei had faked his death (he was the "black-haired beauty" that she mentioned when speaking with Catelyn in Bran's bedroom). I thought this because Gendry said that his mother had "yellow hair". But I guess the "she worked in a tavern" and "she used to sing to me" doesn't work into that theory.
Although I've read the books and know the whole story, there's still a little part of me that thinks that... against all logic.

1092	Mother of Mini Dragons	2013-01-07	My parents watched both seasons over the weekend and they haven't and definitely will not read the books. They love it! My Dad has actually been pretty spot on with some of his guesses. He's guessed that Shae and Tywin will betray Tyrion and that Robb is going to die. He's also onto the fact that Arya's story will get really interesting. He also seems to think Sansa is the one to watch, which I'm only on Book 4 so I don't know yet but I think he may be onto something about it. He hasn't picked up on Littlefinger though - I think that will be good surprise for him. He's definitely a big Dany fan.
1093	Jaqen H'gcarl	2013-01-07	"Robb Stark is going to kill Jamie Lannister, siege Kings Landing, kill Joffrey and finally Marry Daenerys and rule with her."
	Spoiler xD I can't wait to see his expression at the end of S3 at the red wedding
1094	ebevan91	2013-01-09	I am the only person I know who watches the show or reads the books. I have literally nobody to talk to about either one.
When it's time for season 3 to air, I'm going to get on Facebook and spam messages like "Game of Thrones season 3 starts tonight!", maybe some of my friends or family will take note.
1095	Umberto	2012-04-11	I have watched this episode twice now, and I think I have found something many people have missed. I'm referring to the second scene in the episode, with Varys, Tyrion, and Shae.
The first part of the conversation is light and fun, before the overall tone gets serious by Varys mentioning he knows about Shae not being allowed in King's Landing. Here is the part I am referencing:
Tyrion: "Strange things do happen, you should taste her fish pie."
Shae: "I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie."
Varys: "How can you tell?" (in a playful tone)
Shae: "I can always tell." (smiling)
*Varys leans his head back and smiles at Shae*
Tyrion: "Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet."
Now that this little tidbit has been written down for you to analyze, I probably don't have to go into too much detail as to what I think it means. I also want to mention that I don't really care about Varys' sexuality, but I just found this little bit interesting as it seems very subtle but also obvious at the same time. It seems to me that David and Dan are suggesting that Varys is gay. I could be looking too much into it, but I've watched this scene so many times, I can't come up with any other conclusion as to why it was written this particular way.
Of course this revelation doesn't affect the story at all, but I'm just happy to have found something that no one else seems to have found. Tell me I'm not crazy?
1096	Proudwing	2012-04-12	I think she's referencing that he is a eunuch, and therefore has no sexual desire, rather than that he is gay.
1097	Sixshells	2012-04-12	I also thought they were suggesting, not that subtly, that Varys is gay. I may mistake with another book, but isn't there a passage somewhere saying that 
	Spoiler even though he cannot do the deed, he could at least watch (possibly heterosexually but maybe not, I'm not that good at spotting subtle indications of eventual character homosexuality in the books)?
 I think it's in a conversation with Tyrion.
1098	Clariana	2012-04-12	Actually eunuchs IRL can and do have sexual desires. GRR later references this explicitly in ADwD, so and reading this as it is set out above... I concur with the OP and thank him for bringing this interesting titbit to the table.I also like the reference fisherman, Tyrion is so clever isn't he?
1099	Ser Sweets	2012-04-12	Actually eunuchs IRL can and do have sexual desires. GRR later references this explicitly in ADwD, And there are multiple ways to pleasure a man without involving his penis or testicles.The most obvious way would be mostly dealt by another male, though.I always assumed Varys had homosexual tendencies; not only for being a eunuch, since in the books there are eunuchs later who are heterosexual, but also for his demeanour, attire, and general depiction as a character.I liked the subtle clarification added into the show. :>
1100	Isis	2012-04-12	I noticed that dialogue when I watched the episode, yes... because I was paying close attention. Isn't that what people do when they are really interested in something? I didn't think it was such a momentous revelation. *shrug*
1101	Francis Buck	2012-04-12	Yeah, I also didn't take it as particularly meaningful. To me it was just a reference to Varys being a eunuch, which Tyrion called him out on with the "fishpie" thing. And I've never had impression that Varys was supposed to be gay. He seems pretty disinterested in sex or any sort of companionship in general, regardless of whether or not he actually could experience sexual gratification.
1102	zippypoodle	2012-04-12	Didn't Littlefinger imply last season that Varys was into little boys?
As for eunuchs having sex, I remember reading somewhere that European castrati (guys castrated when young to maintain their high voices but combining that with the male vocal power when adults) often had flings with high-class women because there was no possibility of pregnancy although they could still "perform", as it were.
1103	Silverx2	2012-04-12	Didn't Littlefinger imply last season that Varys was into little boys?I believe that was in reference to the fact that many of Vary's "little birds" where in fact children workers throughout kings landning.In regards to the fishpie remark, that would at least for me, lead to the idea of a oral activity, which I'm more then sure a eunuch could perform. This would point to the fact that he is gay yes, which i didnt think was ever in doubt was it? Also in I want to say a storm of swords one of Danys unsullied was paying to lay with a whore, not for anything routinely sexual but to be held by a naked women. So yes eunuchs can get enjoyment out of it.
1104	Lord Varys	2012-04-12	Varys did sell his (remaining) private parts while living on the streets of Myr. But that was after he was cut, and he did it most likely not for pleasure.
Eunuchs also want to love and be loved, that's true, but Varys is not as stupid to let his desires/wishes to get the better of him. In fact, he and Tyrion actually discuss this topic in ASoS, and Varys very hints at the fact that Tyrion's obsession with Shae will prove to be his downfall.
Varys was rather pissed by Littlefinger indicating he could use his little birds for his sexual pleasure. That's most likely not the case. Not in the series, and not in the books.
1105	Hear Us Roar	2012-04-12	well i think she is referring to the fact that she thinks he is asexual because he is a eunuch. That is not true but the way they view sexuality back then, that is why the did it to male guarding females.
1106	sarah.jenice	2012-04-12	I interpreted it as he was gay because I thought he looked surprise when Shae told him she could always tell. I took it as Shae saying Varys didn't like women, and he asked her how she could tell. 
I thought Tyrion saying he was going to make a fisherman of him yet was one of his funniest lines.
1107	Mr. E	2012-04-12	Interesting tidbit to notice. I myself never thought Varys was gay; it was fairly apparent from the start that his "feminine attire" if I may, that a couple have referenced (the powders, the perfumes, the giggling) is just an act anyway. I D&D did mean to imply this, however, it's a great study of subtlety in dialogue.
1108	Lord Varys	2012-04-12	I interpreted this 'I can always tell' as a nod towards book Shae's talent to see through Varys's disguises. He was rather pissed about that in the books. But the start of the conversation was Varys commenting about Shae's cover story (Tyrion finding her in Tywin's kitchens), so I rather believe this was all part of the veiled threats business.
1109	Blood Rider	2012-04-12	The scene was more to me like veiled threats disguised cleverly in a trade of words. Witty and humorous. I would love to see Shae's gaydar on Loras Tyrell though.
1110	Hyper	2012-04-12	I always assumed Varys had homosexual tendencies; not only for being a eunuch, since in the books there are eunuchs later who are heterosexual, but also for his demeanour, attire, and general depiction as a character.Remember that Varys is an actor. Everything he does is carefully done to project a certain image. This is why people don't recognize him in his disguises.

1111	Ser Lepus	2012-04-12	People in Westeros seem to have certain preconceptions with regard to eunuchs (all become effeminate, etc.), so maybe Shae is just repeating those preconceptions. Even if she can perceive that Varys isnÂ´t lusting over her, that doesnÂ´t mean that he is homosexual, but Shae probably thinks that every man who doesnÂ´t desire her is gay.
1112	Envie	2012-04-12	I also think the point of that scene was more about the veiled threats as others have said and not so much to 'expose' Varys' sexuality one way or the other.
Someone else also pointed out that later in the books, we learn that Eunuchs do in fact still have desires (whether sexual or just for affection) as is revealed with the Unsullied slaves after freed, do go to whorehouses.
Varys has verbally sparred with Littlefinger on more than one occasion about his sexuality and I felt Varys won that one with his "you seem unusually obsessed with my gash" remarks personally. He successfully deflected Littlefinger's insinuation about his little birds being boys that Varys must be interested in sexually too.
Varys has spent many years perfecting the art of being neutral and I believe this translates into his sexuality as well. I don't think Littlefinger has any dirt on him at all in that regards, and Tyrion's likely just poking at an already well poked at sore spot for Varys. Varys clearly is used to this sort of insinuating and doesn't bat an eye at it when Tyrion tries to use it as a threat. That's why Tyrion had to stop him forcefully at the door and just come right out and say what he wanted to say - because he knows Varys is the master of masking emotions and using veiled threats.
Is Varys asexual or homosexual? We don't know and the scene probably helps viewers start to wonder this for themselves. Martin has never explicitly said in the books. But then again he never explicitly said Renly and Loras were lovers either so there's always wiggle room for interpretation.
1113	Im no Ser	2012-04-12	As Tyrion follows it up by talking about "our disadvantages", I assume the line was a reference to the fact that they both have physical disadvantages - e.g., Tyrion's dwarfism and Varys castration.
I've always wondered whether Varys was a eunuch at all, or whether it was just yet another disguise that he wears.  Shae's line seems to settle it for the series, given her ability to see through his disguises.

Shae's line seems to settle it for the series, given her ability to see through his disguises.Really? I guess I've never considered over the years of book reading that Varys could be lying and in fact using his 'Eunuch' status as part of his disguise. But to what purpose? I'm not sure how being castrated by foreigners before he came to Westeros is of any real advantage to him in his role as the 'spider' or spy of the royal court.

But to what purpose? I'm not sure how being castrated by foreigners before he came to Westeros is of any real advantage to him in his role as the 'spider' or spy of the royal court.Because giggling Eunuchs are perceived as less of a threat (both short and long term) than he-man knights in the PC world of Westeros.  It's pretty clear that at least part of the "Varys" personality is an act:  there are several occasions when he is talking to people (who are usually about to die) and his voice changes to the point where it doesn't sound like the same man.BTW, I think he's a eunuch.  His story about his castration has the ring of truth to me.  But at the end of the day the only evidence on the subject we've received is his word, and he's a professional liar.

But at the end of the day the only evidence on the subject we've received is his word, and he's a professional liar.I agree with you that the giggling, simpering and powdered looks are all part of an act too. This was revealed in the books as well as in the show when he came to Ned Stark repeatedly dressed as the jail guard and speaking less femininely.I too think Varys is actually a Eunuch but is playing on Westeros beliefs that being a eunuch must make you weak and girlish somehow. Not necessarily homosexual, but definitely not manly either. Robbing a man of his manhood does not necessarily turn him gay or even weak as we later learn with the Unsullied.
1117	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-12	This particular scene was very well done and was not meant to question Varys' sexuality.  It was a humorous spar with words where the show was able to tell the audience that Varys has a way of knowing, but Shae does also.  A lot of characters in both the books and the show try to make guesses about Varys' sexuality.  But all of these snide comments made to Varys become unfounded throughout the series.  LF implies that he's a pedophile who likes boys since he assumes his 'little birds' must be all boys, but in the epilogue of ADWD we learn that they are in fact children of both genders. There are many characters within the series who have questionable sexuality or sexual practices that later turn out to be true, but Varys is has never so much as slipped up in two decades to reveal that he is anything but what he says he is - a eunuch who has no friends and knows no love.
I think Varys is a eunuch and I trust that his story to Tyrion has elements of truth in it.  However, there are lots of theories floating out there that Varys may in fact be a woman.  The evidence these theories present coupled with the conversation with Shae give merit to the theories.  I think it's unlikely Varys is a woman, but the theories are interesting nonetheless.
1118	Bastard of Boston	2012-04-12	This is Varys. At his core, I think his main goal is to keep people guessing. He may be gay. He may be straight. He may be all the above. One thing that is definitely not straight about him is the idea that he's not likely to ever give you a straight answer...about anything.

Tell me I'm not crazy?In season one Littlefinger eluded to the same thing.
1120	Fredwin	2012-04-12	Did we ever get a PoV where he admits to himself that he is a Eunuch? All I can remember is the horrific story he tells about how he became one, but that could all be lies. Outside of that, how do we know he's a Eunuch at all? I certainly wouldn't want visual evidence.
1121	Lady Olenna	2012-04-12	I thought the reference was pretty obvious - my ears pricked up at the mention of "fish pie" because it just stands out. I thought it was absolutely hilarious and I loved how the end of the conversation continued with the threats if being tossed into the sea. But good old Varys continues to paddle...
I do think that a woman adept in the ability to please men for money would probably be able to sum up a man pretty quickly. So Shae may indeed know what she is talking about.
1122	CrypticWeirwood	2012-04-12	And there are multiple ways to pleasure a man without involving his penis or testicles.The most obvious way would be mostly dealt by another male, though.We know he claims to have sold what parts were left to him.  That means he let other men bugger him, and he certainly could have been brought to orgasm that way.
1123	Auska	2012-04-13	â<U+0080>¦Subtle?
1124	The Knight of Flours	2012-04-14	lol yeah it was as subtle as a brick
1125	legba11	2012-04-14	Subtle?
1126	Envie	2012-04-14	Subtle or not, I don't think the scene revealed Varys' sexuality at all. Again, as in the past many times, Varys is a pro at deflecting insinuating insults thrown at him regarding his castration and sexuality. After the clearly antagonistic things Littlefinger threw at him regarding his 'gash' and little boys last season - its laughable to think some ribald remarks from Tyrion and his whore regarding fish pie would ruffle the feathers of Varys.
1127	Joe Scallywag	2012-04-15	I think she's referencing that he is a eunuch, and therefore has no sexual desire, rather than that he is gay. This, most likely, that's how i saw it.
1128	Xtopher	2012-04-15	Tyrion: "Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet."So Varys being gay would then be a disadvantage? why would it be?TyrionÂ´s height is a disadvantage, but how can VaryÂ´s homosexual tendency be a disadvantage? in order for that to be true wouldnt it be a bit homophobic of you?just throwing that out there.

I suspect this dig was meant more towards Varys' disadvantage being a castrated eunuch rather than any suggestion he's homosexual. Then again, as much as Tyrion loves women and loves sex, its also likely Tyrion would consider not liking women to be a disadvantage as well. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />

1131	Rocky0390	2012-07-06	I think varys is definitely an eunuch because (but also having read the books) what about the scene in the show where the whore feels him right in that area and finds nothing. I think it would also serve to represent much of what he is a la serving the realm and nothing else more important than that.
1132	Quiet Isle	2012-09-14	As Tyrion follows it up by talking about "our disadvantages", I assume the line was a reference to the fact that they both have physical disadvantages - e.g., Tyrion's dwarfism and Varys castration.I've always wondered whether Varys was a eunuch at all, or whether it was just yet another disguise that he wears.

1133	Im no Ser	2012-09-14	I think varys is definitely an eunuch because (but also having read the books) what about the scene in the show where the whore feels him right in that area and finds nothing. I think it would also serve to represent much of what he is a la serving the realm and nothing else more important than that.I believe he is a eunuch, but the series diverges from the books and I don't take revelations there as dispositive to the books.As for Varys serving "the realm and nothing else" - just because Varys says so doesn't mean it's true.  He's caused an awful lot of misery over the decades for someone with only the public good on his mind.
1134	someonetyriondpayforsex	2012-09-15	If it is said that Varys sold his 'remaining part's on the streets then what parts were they? I thought he said he had been cut root and stem?He still has hands, a mouth, and â<U+0080>¦ stuff. One can sell all that. It's a question of technique.
1135	Quiet Isle	2012-09-16	I think she's referencing that he is a eunuch, and therefore has no sexual desire, rather than that he is gay.  VARYS, my friends, IS A WOMAN.
1136	Angalin	2012-09-17	Book spoilers stay in the appropriate book forums.
1137	RumHam	2012-12-02	I think the fish pie thing was a jab at him being a eunuch (disinterested in vagina.)  Just because a man employs (at the least) dozens of little boys doesn't mean he's gay.
1138	Howdyphillip	2012-04-09	I have been wanting to discuss this since I watched the episode last night. This was the first major plot change of the series so far, and I actually enjoyed it. For the first time since I started watching the series, I don't know what is going to happen. As long as they deviate from the books in a huge manner, I am OK with different outcomes of side stories.
Well, of course I know that it is not curtains for Jon Snow, but is this going to be the end of Craster? Is Gilly joining the crew now and venturing North? How are they going to do the Mormont death scene next season? I think that what will happen in the immediate future (next episode) is that Ghost is going to get him a hefty serving of Craster's ass tartar.
The only other thing that I wanted to mention was that I wish the shot of the Other taking the child would have been a bit more pronounced. I don't think it truly came across to the viewer exactly what was happening. The Other was mistaken for a wildling by the non book readers in my house.

1139	Chelly	2012-04-09	Well, it did have the bright blue eyes and was in the same getup like the one shown in the season premiere, but I can see how someone who only watches the show can mistake the other for a wildling. The Others were only shown very briefly in the first 14 minutes of the very first episode of the series and never shown again. I would like to see more of the Others because they are kept so shrouded and I really want to see what's so different about them from regular people.I liked this scene, too. It wouldn't be right for tv viewers to have to wait like 2 seasons to finally find out what Craster was doing to his sons since its not a majorly direct plot point in Jon's story, by the time its revealed most people would have either forgotten or stopped caring. Its the why that is the real mystery, not the what. I have no problem with the show moving things along, especially the north of the wall story. I don't think Craster will die in the next episode, maybe he will just kick the NW out? I hope they don't kill Mormont right away since scenes were shown in the previews and extras with Mormont, Jon, and Qhorin walking together after they meet up.I'm not sure about Gilly. I think she will be returning at the end of the season, if she doesn't come along. Maybe they will kill Mormont at the end of this season? /frown5.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':frown5:' />
1140	Envie	2012-04-09	At first, I was like "Crater? What crater?" but then I was like "oh... typo, duh!"
I watched a preview for coming episodes and it appears Craster's going to go back and confront Mormont and tell him to GTFO - and that may be the end of Craster scenes for this season. I can't imagine they're going to cram the Gilly stuff, along with Mormont's death all into one season to shave off such a huge part of the story on their adventures beyond the wall. Besides, I also saw cut scenes of them in the Fist, where the tall mountains and deep snow (filmed in Iceland) are displayed with such gorgeous filming, and Mormont's definitely in those scenes so he's not getting killed now.
As for the Other... there's only a brief moment you see its blue glowing eyes, but its definitely there. I could see how non book readers might get confused though as the figure had what appeared to be furs or rags on for clothing and that does seem more like a wildling than some mysterious magical creature.
1141	teemo	2012-04-09	I thought it was....odd.  A made-up cliffhanger.  Hmm.  I'm assuming there is going to be some sort of drama and Craster is going to force them all out and Jon will barely get away with all of his limbs intact.  It looks like Mormont may be defending Jon or something.  And even though I think the point of the cliffhanger was to surprise people because "LOOK!! That's a white walker like we saw in S1E1!!!!"  but instead people are like, "Huh? What is that? A wildling?"  It would have made more sense if they just went from the book...Gilly telling Jon why she doesn't want to stay with Craster and tell him she saw the blue eyes.
And I think it was a "too convenient" type of moment.  What are the chances that someone just had a baby and Craster just happened to run over to a White Walker near Jon - "here you go, enjoy!"  Please, please.....I hope that it's not Gilly's baby and Jon goes over to save it.

1142	congokong	2012-04-09	I prefer the show to be as faithful to the book as possible. While it's cool to see the Others take a sacrifice, do you really think Craster is stupid enough to do it over the night that 200 Night's Watch are visiting? And whose baby is this now?
1143	The Faceless Bard	2012-04-09	Yeah, making Craster more sly and stealthy then Jon snow is kind of a reach for me .... so I didnt like that scene at all.
1144	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2012-04-09	Yeah, making Craster more sly and stealthy then Jon snow is kind of a reach for me .... so I didnt like that scene at all.As Dolorous Edd pointed out, Craster does live out in the open untouched, while the other wildings are fleeing, while Nights watchmen and wildlings alike end up as wights.
1145	Envie	2012-04-09	It's written fairly plainly by the end of the Craster chapters of the book - you understand that Craster has a 'deal' going with the Others. He gives them plenty of boy babies (though I have no idea what they actually do with them) and in return, they leave him alone and free from attack. This is why he can afford to live out in the open and has no fear or need to run to the wildling refugee camps with Mance Rayder.
1146	DannySpud	2012-04-10	People are saying it is a bit of a coincidence that someone had a baby right when the NW were there, I don't think it is. I think the baby was already around and Craster gave it to the Others to protect the NW. Then next episode I can imagine Jon telling Mormont, Mormont confronting Craster about it, Craster explaining, and Mormont being pissed. Then Craster kicks them out for being ungrateful.
1147	Mrs.Stark	2012-04-10	I have been wanting to discuss this since I watched the episode last night. This was the first major plot change of the series so far, and I actually enjoyed it. For the first time since I started watching the series, I don't know what is going to happen.

I don't think it truly came across to the viewer exactly what was happening. The Other was mistaken for a wildling by the non book readers in my house.I'm also wondering what is going to happen now and I'm a bit excited to see what they've done with the story line, as long as it's nothing too drastic. I don't really understand why so many people were confused by the other. They had some pretty odd crackling noises while Jon was approaching the scene and then you see the outline of a pretty huge humanoid, who has really bright shining blue eyes. I thought it was pretty obvious and so did my husband (who didn't read the books). I guess for some people it wasn't that clear though, but I'm sure in the next episode it will become completely obvious what was going on.
1148	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-10	I felt so stupid after watching because I totally forgot that it was known that Craster gave his boy babies to the Others. 
I wish we knew how long it was from when Gilly talks to Jon to when the baby is delivered to the Others.  The cliffhanger for me was 'who's baby is that?  Was it Gilly's?'  We already know Jon is gonna be ok because HBO has shown a dozen trailers with Jon having a cut on his nose.  I'm assuming they will use his time being knocked out expanding on the warg abilities.
1149	The Meeraculous Third Reed	2012-04-10	Craster knocking out Jon was so pointless.
1150	Hear Us Roar	2012-04-10	Craster knocking out Jon was so pointless.really considering we don't know what will happen next week, i am gonna hold off on judgement.Deviataion from the books is inevitiable, and not necessarily bad. We could stay here all night nitpicking there differences from the book.
1151	David Selig	2012-04-10	I loved it. Craster made Jon his bitch again, what's not to like?
1152	The Last Dragon	2012-04-10	Craster knocking out Jon was so pointless.Don't think it's pointless. Think it was a necessary moment to explain Jon's capability to warging in to Ghost. Can be that the show starts with a Wolf dream in the snow, and then Ghost finding a unconsciousness Jon.
1153	redriver	2012-04-10	One point I would like to make is that when you see a deviation from the books in the show,you should give it time to play out as a plot line before making a final judgement on whether it works or not.
1154	DannySpud	2012-04-10	One point I would like to make is that when you see a deviation from the books in the show,you should give it time to play out as a plot line before making a final judgement on whether it works or not.Yeah, "Grr, Rhakaro had a moment with Dany. He is going to replace Daario, noooooo!!"
1155	Songlian	2012-04-10	Craster knocking out Jon was so pointless.It seemed to me like one of those cheap tv-tricks to raise suspense. They can do better than this.
1156	hoelk	2012-04-10	It seemed to me like one of those cheap tv-tricks to raise suspense. They can do better than this.I dont wanna sound like a troll, but bave you actually read the books? From what I remember every single chapter ends of a cheap cliffhanger.

1157	K-Raptor	2012-04-10	I like how the show confirms things for book-readers that are not explicitly mentioned in the books (like Renly and Loras being gay). But the White Walker still looks nothing like a White Walker to me. It already looked like an Uruk-Hai with bright blue eyes in the pilot, and now it looks like some tall blue-eyed humanoid in rags.
And I don't think it's Gilly's baby. It's hard to see, but Gilly doesn't seem to have a big belly yet.

There is plenty going on with the story as it's written to have suspense at the end of every episode.  Honestly, with what Craster saw Jon see - there is no reason for Jon to not be dead at this point.  Knock him out to drag him back to Mormont and tell him...what? Mormont knows (or, well in this universe maybe he doesn't) that Craster has been giving his sons...and doesn't care as it's none of his business.
1159	David Selig	2012-04-10	I dont wanna sound like a troll, but bave you actually read the books? From what I remember every single chapter ends of a cheap cliffhanger.This. OK, it's not at the end of every single chapter, but there are so many of those.If anything, the show has been much better at avoiding cheap cliffhangers than the books.

1160	The Unborn	2012-04-10	Maybe as soon as Craster hit John, Ghost jumped on him. We'll see in 5 days I guess
1161	Songlian	2012-04-10	I dont wanna sound like a troll, but bave you actually read the books? From what I remember every single chapter ends of a cheap cliffhanger.Don't worry, no troll labeling will happen on this side. And yes, of course I read the books. If nothing else, my avatar should have made you think.As to your answer, Greywolf2375 already explained rather well part of my problem with it:So then why make one up?  There is plenty going on with the story as it's written to have suspense at the end of every episode.  Honestly, with what Craster saw Jon see - there is no reason for Jon to not be dead at this point.  Knock him out to drag him back to Mormont and tell him...what?The rest of it stands like this: I just don't buy it. GRRM's cliffhangers are so good because they are believable and carry weight to the story. This one doesn't. What am I supposed to fear or be curious about, that they pull a Rakharo on Jon? I know it isn't going to happen. So then, what's the point? Just a bit of drama added on top of the plenty enough drama.As always, this is just my opinon. If you enjoyed it and thought it was a great tv moment, I'm sincerely glad for you. It's supposed to be enjoyed, after all.
1162	TheMountainThatAbides	2012-04-10	I have to say I wasn't too fond of this particular scene either but as some have already pointed out I'm going to wait for the third episode before really judging.
1163	Tourniquet	2012-04-10	My g/f (non-reader) had no idea who was talking the baby and she is an avid watcher of the show...I had to explain.
1164	Lord of Cheese	2012-04-10	So then why make one up?  There is plenty going on with the story as it's written to have suspense at the end of every episode.

I dont really understand what comes next. If i was Craster i would kill Jon, and not just knock him out. Then blame it on wildlings. No fight is supposed to happen at this stage. Really odd....
1165	Tourniquet	2012-04-10	He could attempt to kill him and Jon can be saved by Ghost or Sam. Or Craster means to blackmail him knowing that Mormont knows and doesn't care what he is doing.
1166	wolverine	2012-04-10	My g/f (non-reader) had no idea who was talking the baby and she is an avid watcher of the show...I had to explain.There is no reason the audience HAS to know now that an Other took the baby.  They can find out next episode or whatever.  Maybe they don't want the audience to know for sure already.
1167	Tourniquet	2012-04-10	There is no reason the audience HAS to know now that an Other took the baby.  They can find out next episode or whatever.  Maybe they don't want the audience to know for sure already.Fair enough!
1168	bloodymime	2012-04-10	My own thought was that they could be wanting to give Jon a more noble reason for deserting. Being disgusted with a bunch of timid crows that allows a man to sacrifice babies on their watch sounds a bit better than whining to Mance about where they sat the bastard at Robert's feast.
1169	Francis Buck	2012-04-10	Honestly I think they put this scene in for one reason, and one reason only: The Others do not appear in the second book whatsoever, and this is the most logical place to put them. I believe the showrunners felt it would seem really weird for non-book readers that, despite all the talk last season of how the White Walkers were returning and how huge of threat they are, if suddenly they just don't appear even a single time this entire season. It would lessen their impact, and make them seem like less of an issue. Everything else about the sequence was simply a way to make that happen. Personally I have no problem with it at all.
1170	Greywolf2375	2012-04-10	He could attempt to kill him and Jon can be saved by Ghost or Sam. Or Craster means to blackmail him knowing that Mormont knows and doesn't care what he is doing.Blackmail into what though?  And with what?My comment above is based on Craster knocking him out for his own purposes.  I spose they could wrap it that Craster was hitting him to save him from the Other in the manner that not having a weapon in Predator meant it would leave you alone - "See, I'm taking him away so he doesn't bother you and wrapping him on the head will make him forget he saw a 7 foot tall monster with blue eyes take one of my sons."
1171	Battlekitten	2012-04-10	My g/f (non-reader) had no idea who was talking the baby and she is an avid watcher of the show...I had to explain.I am a reader and I wouldn't have known.  It is so dark and I just think I saw the baby and then a rather furry humanoid figure moving about before it cut to Jon.  Could have been big foot! If anyone has stills showing the Other I would be much obliged.I only wonder: in the books the Watch know Craster sacrifices his sons, but do they know it is to White Walkers specifically and in fact?  After all human sacrifice was practiced in the North (vide: heart trees) and the Watch knows practically nothing about White Walkers.  They are a legend.  If they had known Craster sacrificed to them today they would be a lot more real surely?  At the time of the books they find out WW are about again or at least that wights are but they don't make the link with Craster?  Or they do but leave it alone since he is too important to the NW?So, in the TV series if the Watch find out Craster specifically sacrificed to White Walkers (Jon sees one) surely all bets should be off and they should not let it continue or at least try and find out something more about this true threat.  It ought to become more important than the Wildlings and it would in itself explain the Wildlings absence.  If not it's a travesty of all they, the NW, are supposed to stand for.In the preview for Episode 3SPOILER There is a shadowed figure and ice cracking or perhaps just snow underfoot.  Then Craster appears clutching Jon's sword and says "Out all of you and you will make this right"What on earth is going on?  I would suspect all hell breaks loose at Craster's Keep as jon / Ghost disrupted the sacrifice but maybe it's my overactive imagination
1172	Crown	2012-04-10	I don't know if I like it or not, but yeah, had to explain the blue-eyes to my other aswell. Yes, I watch it with my mother.
1173	Milcov	2012-04-10	I liked the Other being there, I wasn't a fan of Craster discovering Jon.
1174	Morrigan	2012-04-10	The glowing blue eyes wasn't a big sign of obviousness? Huh. I guess it's hard for me to imagine  knowing, but still, I thought I'd recognize the dark, gaunt, blue-eyed figure from the S1 beginning if I were a non-reader. But maybe I'd have missed it, I dunno.
I thought the cliffhanger was a bit dumb because, as someone said, we know Jon's gonna be ok, so the suspense is fake, and I'm really sick of the blow-to-the-head-insta-KO clichA©. It's probably the most overused trope in fiction, really, and I know I sound like a nerd (irony considering these boards /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />) but it doesn't work like that in real life, grr! It's lazy writing; the writers need to render a character unconscious, but can't think of any other way so they use the blow to the head. Meh. Anyway, it's not a huge deal or anything, but I wish that clichA© wouldn't be used that much.
My prediction is that Jon will wake up groggy, and try to tell Mormont what he saw, but Craster will call him a liar and say he was just dreaming. Or something. But it will still arouse suspicions in the NW, perhaps someone will ask "what happened to that heavily pregnant girl that was around" (not that we saw any... but eh) and Craster will say it was stillborn and he was just burying the body in the woods, but then the NW people will start muttering, and Craster will tell them to leave. The NW will leave but resentfully, foreshadowing the mutiny that will inevitably happen later.

The "cheapness" of a cliffhanger is really difficult to establish if you're using book hindsight for the tv show.BTW, I have to disagree with you on the quality of all of GRRM's cliffhangers. Before and during the red wedding they were great. After the red wedding there have been too many faux-deaths, to the extent that death has become meaningless.That said, I don't think Jon's life is supposed to be at stake here. The built tension is the consequence of Craster finding out Jon spied on him.  We've seen him as a reluctant host and Jon's shennenagans will probably piss him off even more. What will it mean for the NW? That's what viewers are wondering.

Maybe Craster wants to stop Jon from doing something very stupid, like fighting the Other. Craster obviously knows more about them than Jon, so he assumes Jon has no idea what he's up against. Also, some guy attacking an Other near Crasters place could have bad consequences for him as well. I don't think he wants to cover up the sacrifice of the boy, because he plainly doesn't give a shit about what Mormont/the Watch thinks...
1177	Ferrum Aeternum	2012-04-10	Didn't the WW/Other's "talking" in that ice-cracking speech (just prior to the reveal) give it away?  That was a surer sign than the blue eyes, which were only glimpsed briefly.
1178	Songlian	2012-04-10	The "cheapness" of a cliffhanger is really difficult to establish if you're using book hindsight for the tv show.On this you are quite right. I am biased on the matter by having read the books in advance. I cannot know how non-reader feel about it.

But like you, I cannot undo my knowledge of the books so some form of comparison will always linger. Not all changes are bad though. GRRM has really created an unfilmable beast and I think that D&D are doing remarkably well. I am convinced, however, that they'll increasingly have to find their own voice (A  la craster and jon) if the show is to remain succesful.
1180	Hyper	2012-04-10	This thread is such a great example of "so-called reader" purist outrage. Let me cite examples:
1) Renly + Loras ....Outrage - then oh, they are gay?
2) Stannis having Sex with Melisandre ... Outrage, before evidence pointed out. Still in denial.
3) Craster having a 'deal' with the Others ... Well, you get the picture.
4) Yara not being HOT! ...See the Yara thread in this sub-forum
Sure, none of these are stated outright. But if you cannot see how these are reasonable interpretations, then a re-read is recommended. The really sad part of this is how many of the purist nitpickers that don't know the books half as well as they think they do.
I can't wait to find out what the next outrage will be.
1181	The Greenseer	2012-04-10	I felt so stupid after watching because I totally forgot that it was known that Craster gave his boy babies to the Others. It is known
1182	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-10	Seriously though, who's baby was it?  Is it Gilly's or some other daughter wife?  That seemed like the most cliffhanger part of the cliffhanger.
1183	Hyper	2012-04-10	Not Gilly's, She didn't look anywhere close to term. (Nor should she, since she gives birth far later in the books)
I'm not sure why people assume it is Gilly's baby. Did they not see that Craster has other "daughters"?
1184	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-10	Not Gilly's, She didn't look anywhere close to term. (Nor should she, since she gives birth far later in the books)I'm not sure why people assume it is Gilly's baby. Did they not see that Craster has other "daughters"?We all saw his other daughter-wives and we know Gilly gives birth much later (the show isn't even following the books to the letter).  But I don't recall another daughter-wife giving birth while the NW is at Craster's in the books.  I couldn't even tell that Gilly was pregnant in the show.  She has so many clothes and furs wrapped around her.  When Gilly is talking to Jon, she doesn't say anything about her sister/mothers/aunts being preggers with boys.  So if no other child was born while the nights watch was there in the books (and my memory might be wrong on this) and if the show is following that example, then it's easy to think that it was Gilly's baby. We already know that nothing terrible happens to Jon because he's in so many trailers and previews so that's not the cliffhanger.  Truly, who's baby is it!
1185	sagaz	2012-04-10	In the books the NW goes to Craster's, then to the fist of the first men and send some rangers in different directions (Jon with halfhand, etc) the others are attacked (Sam, the slayer) and go back to craster's when returning to the wall. there (at craster's) is when/ where Mormont is killed.
I think the production is not going to show halfhand and none of it, and also think the NW is going to round up passing craster's one time, not two (and getting gilly) going to the fist and there will be a big attack/revolt jon will be caught by the wildings, mormont killed, sam and gilly lost...from there the same as the book (I was thinking production wise)
1186	Hyper	2012-04-10	I think the production is not going to show halfhand and none of it,Wrong. Qhorin Halfhand is cast. http://gameofthrones...Qhorin_Halfhandand also think the NW is going to round up passing craster's one time, not two (and getting gilly) going to the fist and there will be a big attack/revolt jon will be caught by the wildings, mormont killed, sam and gilly lost...from there the same as the book (I was thinking production wise)No, the Jon story from ACOK appears to be pretty much intact (the major points), based on footage that have been seem from Iceland and various trailers.
1187	The Anti-Targ	2012-04-10	I thought it was dumb for 3 reasons: White walkers dogging the NW tail until they get fortified at the Fist? Doesn't make sense. Much easier to attack a column on the move and unprepared. Perhaps it was a lone WW come to claim the tribute, but still 1 WW can pretty much kill the entire NW expedition as soon as it leaves Craster's. The only way to kill a WW is with dragon glass and the NW have exactly none. And Mormont needs to meet up with Qhorin and send them on a ranging up the Skirling pass yet. I think it would have been fine to move the aSoS prologue into the final episode of the season and that would have been enough WW exposure for the season. Second reason it was dumb is the fact Craster snapped Jon and knocked him out. Contriving Jon not losing an appendage at least is gonna be a bit dumb, without killing off Craster. Jon wakes up, if he gets a chance to talk he's gonna spill the beans about Craster's cosy deal with the WW. Mormont has no choice but to kill Craster. Colluding with the great evil beyond the wall can't be tolerated from anyone. 3rd reason, why the hell would Craster risk being seen with hundreds of black brothers around, and no doubt some of them on guard duty simply because that's what you do when you are on an expedition, even in a place of relative safety, North of the wall no where is truly safe for the NW. So it's just not logically consistent within the context of the world, IMO.
And there really is no need to resolve the "what does Craster do with his son's" mystery within the space of 2 episodes. I think the Craster angle could have pretty much been played out as per the book. Did they do it perhaps because they couldn't be sure of season 3 so they didn't want to leave too many lose ends? They could have shown him dropping a son out to the WW the night after they leave, without any witnesses.
I just don't see a satisfying resolution to this. If there is a satisfying resolution I'll change my opinion, because I'm not complaining simply because it's a change from the books. I just don't see a way to get through this digression without it looking contrived and awkward. We'll see I guess.
1188	The Greenseer	2012-04-10	Seriously though, who's baby was it?  Is it Gilly's or some other daughter wife?  That seemed like the most cliffhanger part of the cliffhanger.I assume it was not Gillys baby because her baby plays a future role in the story.  After Sam is sent from the wall with the baby, he later surmises that Jon swapped the baby with Mances. Mayhaps the producers saw the story as insigifigant & thought it was best to show baby taken right there, and give Sam cause to take her to safety.
1189	Ghyran	2012-04-11	Do I remember incorrectly.. I though t Craster had some relationship with the skinchangers, doesn't he give the boy babies to them? It wasn't a white walker was it?
1190	Tywin's bastard	2012-04-11	One point I would like to make is that when you see a deviation from the books in the show,you should give it time to play out as a plot line before making a final judgement on whether it works or not.Such a simple point and yet so few actually seem capable of understanding it. A pity.
1191	Tywin's bastard	2012-04-11	I thought it was dumb for 3 reasons: White walkers dogging the NW tail until they get fortified at the Fist? Doesn't make sense.

The only way to kill a WW is with dragon glass and the NW have exactly none.The books never say anything of the sort and if that's the case it seems completely unnecessary for them to create an army of wights. The Night's Watch have at least one item with them that's speculated to be very efficient against them, plus that we know they hate warmth and they might not like fire that much more than their wight's do. And on an even simpler note, I've yet to read anything that suggests that it would be impossible for hundreds of men to wrestle it down and tie it up.You answer the rest of your post yourself (that it's best to wait and see).

1192	Morky_Pep	2012-04-11	I knew it was a white walker/other when I saw it, but I can see how non book readers got confused, and I think thats the point. I mean I heard the noises it made and that was a clue, but I watched the episode twice and never even seen the blue eyes because they were so quick. Then I was on here and saw all these comments, rewatched and saw it.
I see alot of complaints on how the series isnt subtle and just lay things out in a dumbed down fashion, but this is a perfect example of how the show can be subtle. People who havent read the books are most likely NOT going to realize that its a white walker and I think that was the producers intent. There going to say "what in the hell was that?!?!" And for fans who really pay attention they will see the blue eye and make the connection. Obviously this techinque is somewhat dumbed down from the books but this is a different medium, and I think it worked well to build antipation for the next episode. I assume in the next episode there will be something that confirms easily for non book watchers the identity of the baby stealers.
Overall I think there doing a very good job in this episode, except for the Ros and LF scene. I love LF, but I just dont see Ros not being able to work because of what she saw, like man ya in our world that would be crazy and heartbreaking, but this is Westeros people. Crazy nasty stuff happens, get over it. I just plain hate Ros, shes not hot, shes a terrible character, and i just dont liek seeing her. That scene wasted too much time
1193	Flayed Starkman	2012-04-11	Why are people making such a big fuss about who's baby it is? It isn't Gilly's and it doesn't really matter. This'll show Jon and Sam Gilly's plight, so that when they return to Craster's in season 3, Sam will take her with him.
1194	Hyper	2012-04-11	I knew it was a white walker/other when I saw it, but I can see how non book readers got confused, and I think thats the point. I mean I heard the noises it made and that was a clue, but I watched the episode twice and never even seen the blue eyes because they were so quick. Then I was on here and saw all these comments, rewatched and saw it.I'm surprised so many missed the blue eyes. I saw the episode on a low-res HBOGO stream, and the eyes were perfectly visible when I watched the 1st time. Perhaps they missed them because the eyes were higher up than would be expected - the WW are after all a bit taller than humans.
1195	Maester Nikolas	2012-04-11	They are enormous! The White Walkers- both in S1 and S2 -are played by the guy who is playing Gregor Clegane this season, and he's seven foot one! There was no doubt in my mind what was going on. I'm an avid reader, and I was curious to see what was going to happen- even knowing what Craster was doing. There is very little that can terrify me, the voice of a White Walker is one of the things that can. That icy, crackling snarl is so unique and so distinctive I knew what Jon was heading towards as soon as I heard it- my blood ran cold and my heart was in my throat; that scene terrified me because of I) The White Walker and II) It wasn't part of the book; I couldn't tell what was going to happen, but anything involving the White Walkers can't be good. I just want to know what they do with the kids now. I mean one moment the baby is screaming his head off, the next he stops, and the White Walker gently picks him up and carries him away. I wonder if they're going to discuss that next episode...
In any case- there were four key factors which gave away what that figure was. Size, shape [They do have a distinctive silhouette], those unbelievably bright blue eyes, and its voice. Unless people forgot what the White Walkers sounded like, looked like, and forgot they had blue eyes in just nine episodes. However, considering the complexity of the show [due to the original material] I don't blame them for being confused- GRRM is a genius at hiding plot points for whole books if necessary and then unveiling them to a reader's horror. Unfortunately, that doesn't work well with a TV show that also needs to satisfy a casual audience.

1196	ace	2012-04-11	Book readers would know that all the wildling villages are empty all around Craster's keep, and it's in WW teritorry, and in fact it's repeatedly pointed out how weird it is that no one touches Craster's keep, not the wildlings and not the WWs especially with him being a friend to the Watch. So later when it's revealed that Craster is giving his sons to the WW we understand the mystery. But in the show it's not clear what's so weird about CK being where it is so if they didn't show the sacrifice non book readers wouldn't understand there's something unnatural going on.
Besides the baby sacrifice thing is just the sort of thing TV writers love so I expected it to be explicitly shown. Now I expect Mormont will probably send Jon away with Qhorin and Sam will kill Craster in the ensuing melee shortening the story for the show.
1197	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-11	This probably isn't the right place to ask this but it's something I've wondered.
How is it that Craster is a friend of the watch and also in league with the WW?  It seems that these would be opposing alliances.
1198	Maester Nikolas	2012-04-11	Craster also marries his daughters to have more daughters. If that doesn't bug him, conflicting allegiances won't either.
1199	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-11	Craster also marries his daughters to have more daughters. If that doesn't bug him, conflicting allegiances won't either.Lol, true.  But I meant more about what the conflicting allegiances mean for those he's allied with.  Surely the WW know about Craster's status with the NW just as the NW knows about Craster's status with the WW.  These seem to be opposing forces, enemies almost.  Does this make Craster a turncloak?  If so, it would seem that at least one of these opposing groups would want to punish Craster.  Of course, him dying by the NW hand could be punishment of a sort.
1200	Maester Nikolas	2012-04-11	His communications with Wildlings make him important to the NW and his dealings with the NW make him important to the WW, that and whatever they do with his sons. The WW seem quite aloof from politics- they just march around, do their thing, and they really don't care who they kill or who it is that they're killing. The way it's described in the book prologue it is as if they're hunting those three NW men for sport, because about five or six surround the disarmed knight and butcher him for no reason. And technically speaking as a member of the "Free Folk" Craster doesn't have a cloak, just his word, which as we've seen is pretty worthless.
1201	7V3N	2012-04-11	I really liked the Craster scene at the end of the episode. Possibly the only change I am liking. It makes it much more scary than when you just hear that Craster may be giving his sons to the Others.I find it funny how I read great reviews of the beginning of this season, but I have mostly hated it (cause of what they are doing with LF, Ros, and other changes).EDIT: Also, why did they not just make Dany start in Qarth? They could have cut her til episode 2, starting in Qarth, and have Jorah and her talk about the horrors they faced in the Red Waste to substitute a narrative. This would allow the writers to keep their whore-fetish and still give us a better Dragonstone, which I HATED. I had three non-reader friends text me after the premiere asking who Davos and "the red woman" are. They did not introduce the story of Mel and R'hllor well at all IMO. And no Patchface? Dragonstone was just a scene, not a creepy place where you can see a major facet of the plot is rising.His communications with Wildlings make him important to the NW and his dealings with the NW make him important to the WW, that and whatever they do with his sons. The WW seem quite aloof from politics- they just march around, do their thing, and they really don't care who they kill or who it is that they're killing. The way it's described in the book prologue it is as if they're hunting those three NW men for sport, because about five or six surround the disarmed knight and butcher him for no reason.You may want to read a thread I started that gives the Others the credit they deserve as being a more intelligent being (former humans and CotF to be specific): http://asoiaf.wester...__fromsearch__1

1203	Maester Nikolas	2012-04-11	Oh I don't doubt that the Others are intelligent, I just doubt that they care about Westerosi politics. When you're as powerful as they are and can hunt down a human with impunity, why even bother? The only humans they want to know about would be the NW, because they are their immeadiate opponents and because they've been beaten by them in the past. Other than them, I think the WW view humans as cattle at best, more likely as vermin, and at worst as a blight on the planet. We don't know enough about either the WW or the COTF to speculate about their motives at the moment, but I think it's pretty safe to say that the WW don't have Westeros' best intentions at heart [Or maybe they do- it would be just like GRRM to confuse us right to the end]. Perhaps the show will fill the void of non-information on the WW and the COTF- I certainly hope so; being shrouded in mystery is fine and all but if we're going to save the world from something I want to know what the hell we're up against!
1204	Morrigan	2012-04-11	Am I the only one slightly annoyed that the white walkers we've seen so far are all black as pitch and look like Uruk-hai instead of, you know, milky pale and ethereal creatures? /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />

1205	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-04-11	For those who didn't like the scene because they don't feel that Craster should be able to sneak up on Jon you have got to take into consideration that Jon just witnessed a fucking monster and of course he'll be a bit sluggish and dazed as a result of witnessing some sort of snow demon carrying away a baby.
I like the fact that the show surprised me, I'm thinking Quorin will intervene.  I hope they don't do away with Craster just yet.
The White Walkers are actually pale white/blue, they come off as looking black as pitch because they are usually concealed in darkness. 
oh and I think it is a shit move to spoil something that does not happen in this book but in a later instalment in OP post.  I've read them all so it does not really matter to me, but I can see how someone might assume that the BOOK SPOILERS tag simply means spoilers for CoK.
1206	Greywolf2375	2012-04-12	This thread is such a great example of "so-called reader" purist outrage. Let me cite examples:1) Renly + Loras ....Outrage - then oh, they are gay?2) Stannis having Sex with Melisandre ... Outrage, before evidence pointed out. Still in denial.3) Craster having a 'deal' with the Others ... Well, you get the picture.4) Yara not being HOT! ...See the Yara thread in this sub-forumSure, none of these are stated outright. But if you cannot see how these are reasonable interpretations, then a re-read is recommended. The really sad part of this is how many of the purist nitpickers that don't know the books half as well as they think they do.I can't wait to find out what the next outrage will be.What?  Most of the "outrage" has been about presentation, not the existence, of these things.  yes, there have been folks that did not pick up on them in the books, however most of the debate about them has been the hamfisted way they have been shown.
1207	gogorath	2012-04-12	So, let me get this straight...
We're angry because the writers dared to show something and not tell it, preferably as someone is mid-colitis?
Or because Craster wasn't doing this in the book?  (he was)
Or because the NW would never condone it (they did in the book as a necessary evil)
Or because Craster, walking in the woods he's walked in for forty plus years, snuck up on castle bred pretty boy who was getting his first look at a giant WW?
Or because it wasn't obvious it was a WW?
Or because it was too quickly shown it was a WW?
Or because this minor divergence will necessarily cause a humongous divergence even tho it's entirely possible they just get kicked out of Crasters, no one dies and the story continues on pretty much as the book?
Which overreaction is it?

Gilly doesn't mention any other pregnant girl who may be carrying a boy at Craster's Keep and considering which is odd considering these are her (grand?)mothers, sisters, and aunts.  Plus we all love the books and we love the way they are told so deviating from the story makes us feel funny things.  There's no telling how this cliffhanger will play out.  Will the battle at Craster's happen before the Fist?  Will they even go to the Fist or just have all of the NW stuff play out there while Jon heads off with the Halfhand.  It's fun to discuss these things and also share complain with others who understand how connected we are with this series.
1209	Ghost714	2012-04-13	I just don't like that this scene, along with many others in just two episodes, it might have a horrible butterfly effect for the future story. 
It really seems like they have made more down right changes in these two episodes, than they did for all of season one. Which is fine when they have to make changes for bugetory reasons, but most of them do not seem bugetory at all. That's what's weird for me, because in interviews GRRM has said repeatedly that he believes, if your going to make a book into a show, you should stay as faithful to the story as possible, and if you can't do that, then don't make the adaptation. I really thought D&D understood that, and in season one I though they were really respecting GRRM by staying faithful to the book. Yet now in season two, it seems like they are changing so much, and some of it may seem small now, but a lot of these changes will cause the butterfly effect for the future story, so I hate to imagine how different it will be in a few seasons. The show will always make some changes, but because of things they are doing now, it will cause them to change even more things in the future, it's just not a fun thought. 
I just personally see it the way GRRM does, either stay true to the book, or make up your own story. Unfortunately GRRM did not make them agree to keep everything the same, so he has no control over the changes that they make, but he did express that it was his wish that they try to stay faithful as best as they could(unless for bugetory reasons), when he agreed to let them do the show. I just thought that because D&D are huge fans of aSoIaF, that they would continue staying pretty faithful, like season one, but obviously something has changed.
I really don't agree with the show taking out important things from the books, only to then add so many pointless made up scenes in the show(Ros crying to LF anyone?)

1210	Abifer	2012-04-13	Although initially I felt a bit like "WTF?!", I'm really looking forward to where they're going to go with it.  I find it's a nice surprise that there are such differences from the books, as long as they're still overall in line with the main plot.
1211	Morky_Pep	2012-04-13	^^
i agree with you about the LF and Ros scene. I liked what it showed about LF, but i HATE Ros so i didnt like it. Mean I know. But i liked the Craster scene. What do you mean huge divergence? This was a complicated episode, they have to tailor the series for non readers too, so they put a cliffhanger in for their benefit. It may anger us, but Im sure non book watchers were enthralled. How else were they supposed to imply that WW took the babies? Gilly says some lines? That may be good in a book when all your looking at IS lines, but for a visual medium they need to actually SHOW it. As for repucussions, I just dont see them. There will be some conflict Im sure between Craster and NW but nobody important is going to perish. Maybe Craster will die now and Ill be fine with that because really, the NW betrayel can happen anywhere, Mormonts death can happen anywhere, and what the actor of Crastor is going to be gone a whole season then come back for one episode next season, ro maybe even the FOURTH season. Get ahold of yourself man things are going to change as the story complicates and as long as they keep to the general plot and spirit of the novels I will be happy. And so should you
1212	gogorath	2012-04-13	I was more overreacting because of not knowing who's baby it was.  Gilly doesn't mention any other pregnant girl who may be carrying a boy at Craster's Keep and considering which is odd considering these are her (grand?)mothers, sisters, and aunts.

It's fun to discuss these things and also share complain with others who understand how connected we are with this series.It's obviously not Gilly's baby.  She wasn't showing, or anywhere near giving birth.  And they would have shown her giving birth.  I imagine in writing or editing they do have something that's like "Jenny just had her baby..." but thought it was unnecessary / would take too much time when there's barely enough to show important things.I love the books.  I will be severely disappointed if there is a real deviation that kills a favorite scene (like say, if Jon does not face off versus the Halfhand or if he does so, but it's not for similar dynamics as in the books).  But why panic over it?  Why not enjoy the ride?  If, as you say, you LIKE discussing it, why not rationally discuss it instead of what's going on here.What's more likely:  Craster knocks out Jon, kicks out Mormont & crew and the story continues more or less as planned, with perhaps the exception of the mutiny not being at Craster's, though it certainly could be (the Watch could buy or force their way back in). Or:  Jon's knocked out, and Craster gets angry.  Even though Mormont has known that Craster was sacrificing his children all this time, THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY HE CAN ACCEPT THIS NOW THAT JON KNOWS so Craster must die now.  Even though if this happened, as Morky Pep points out, the rest of the storyline could STILL occur more or less as usual, NO, JON MUST BE SEPARATED NOW FOR HIS BAD DEEDS, and even if that's true, he still could be sent on the same mission to prove himself, BUT NO WE MUST HAVE THE BATTLE NOW AND JON MUST BE CAPTURED EVEN THOUGH WE'VE SEEN PREVIEWS THAT LOOK A LOT LIKE JON AND QUORIN'S TRIP TO THE FROSTFANGS.  THE STORY IS RUINED!Look, instead of just saying "He gives his babies to the Cold" they showed it, for more impact and to actually have some action at the end of the episode, which is nice, since there was no real (violent) action all episode.  You need some kind of climatic end to an episode, whether emotional or physical.  This will probably be the worst ending in the entire season, but it's still better that Gilly saying "He gives them to the Cold."I have no doubt there are going to be lots of changes -- perhaps even some of the panic above will even come true.  But (a) it hasn't yet and (/cool.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='B)' /> it's not necessarily a bad thing.  Who cares if the NW rebellion happens at Craster's?  Who cares if there's even a rebellion.  I *like* that little storyline, and I like the thematic -- what the WW couldn't finish, insquabbling will -- but if the NW just gets crushed at the Fist by the wights and WW, then the story still is intact.  And maybe we get more battle at the Fist.
1213	7V3N	2012-04-13	This seems more like a venting thread for the other horrible changes they've made. This change was minor and keeps all characters true--unlike LF, Dany, now Varys (making threats? no, he would smile and befriend as he plotted his betrayal).
1214	sarah.jenice	2012-04-13	I've watched the first season of Game of Thrones so many times that I never once questioned it being a White Walker because you clearly hear it before you see it. In season one, episode one, whilr Will is running from the Other, you hear the same sounds.  Its likelihood clacking ice cubes and a weird rattling sound. The Others don't look like what I pictured from the books, but I think it would have been maybe more difficult to make a being that looks like its made from ice. I really like the blue eye flashing because Jon will remember that from the wight.
The scene didn't bother me. I really like how they are clearly answering things we could only guess at like the sacrifice of the sons. I am not sure how they will play it now. Maybe Craster just throws them all out and they still come back like in Storm of Swords. It would make even more sense for Sam to save Gilly then because Jon will tell him what happens to the sons so he wouldnt be able to turn Gilly down when she's standing there with a newborn boy. I think it will help the tv audience understand why Sam has to take Gilly.
I agree that Ghost would have ripped Craster's throat out before he even made a step towards Jon, but I think CGI expense will limit the on screen time for our beloved direwolves.
I can't wait to see how they pick this up next week!
1215	Silverx2	2012-04-13	"i can still run if i have to" - Gilly
This one line shows the baby is not in fact gillys. More then likely it is a baby that had already been born, and was awaiting a specific time to be handed off.

1217	Vandalism	2012-04-13	Firstly, Craster should have been more rugged and rough-looking. Secondly, the cliffhanger was slightly unnecessary because 1. It never happened in the books and 2. It was cliche by Game of Thrones standards.
1218	Free Northman	2012-04-13	I immediately assumed it was Gilly's baby, which would require huge deviations from Sam's future plotline, as well as from the babyswapping story later down the line.
Also, this would seem to move forward the fight at Crasters, as I don't see Craster just meekly letting Jon go after this.
Very weird scene.
And lastly, the Other seems totally different from how I imagined it. If anything, it reminded me of the Predator in camouflage mode, jusst with blue eyes. It seems too bulky. I thought the Others were tall, slender graceful creaturs.
Anyway, that's my thoughts on this very strange scene.

They could have cut her til episode 2, starting in Qarth, and have Jorah and her talk about the horrors they faced in the Red Waste to substitute a narrative.this seems like a crazy thing to cut.1. there is little enough for Dany to do this season anyways. they will surely write some new scenes, but cutting a significant part of the journey isnt goint to help2. its an important part of her journey. this is what binds her people to her.3. it really wasn't too much of a time commitment.
1220	Envie	2012-04-14	I immediately assumed it was Gilly's baby, which would require huge deviations from Sam's future plotline, as well as from the babyswapping story later down the line.Also, this would seem to move forward the fight at Crasters, as I don't see Craster just meekly letting Jon go after this.Very weird scene.And lastly, the Other seems totally different from how I imagined it. If anything, it reminded me of the Predator in camouflage mode, jusst with blue eyes. It seems too bulky. I thought the Others were tall, slender graceful creaturs.Anyway, that's my thoughts on this very strange scene.I agree with your points.I don't think it was intended to be Gilly's baby, but rather, another of the daughter-wives. I suspect they were doing this to show the audience what happens to the sons, as highlighted by Jon's remarks when they first arrived. It's a fairly minor deviation from the book at that point since we never do 'see' what happens to the baby boys, only hear about it from Craster's women.The clubbing Jon over the head ending, yeah that is a huge deviation from the story as we know it from the book and now I'm really curious to see how this is going to play out for Mormont and the Night's Watch. Obviously Jon is ok, we know his story goes on - but how does this change the story with the traitors and attack on Mormont and Craster? Does Mormont now send Jon away from the rest of the watch with Qhorin Halfhand and they skip forward a bit? I saw the preview clip with Craster telling Mormont to get the hell out, so I know they vacate at that point and Mormont's alive, so they must return to Craster's keep later on as it was in the books. It's pretty confusing at this point.I also wasn't thrilled with the way they've made the Others look. I re-watched that scene a few times and to me, the large shadowy figure of the Other looks rather bulky, like its wearing skins or furs, which doesn't make any sense with the mystical/magical way they're described in the books. The flash of glowing blue eyes was good, but many have said they missed it so non-book readers are confused about who or what took the baby. I'm guessing they may have done that on purpose to keep it still a mystery of sorts for the future story.

That'd allow a much better Dragonstone prologue scene, which I'd prefer over seeing the Red Waste rather than hearing about it.
1222	HyacinthGirl	2012-04-15	This thread is such a great example of "so-called reader" purist outrage. Let me cite examples:1) Renly + Loras ....Outrage - then oh, they are gay?2) Stannis having Sex with Melisandre ... Outrage, before evidence pointed out. Still in denial.3) Craster having a 'deal' with the Others ... Well, you get the picture.4) Yara not being HOT! ...See the Yara thread in this sub-forumSure, none of these are stated outright. But if you cannot see how these are reasonable interpretations, then a re-read is recommended. The really sad part of this is how many of the purist nitpickers that don't know the books half as well as they think they do.I can't wait to find out what the next outrage will be. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' /> This. I'm furious about the Yara situation, I think Gemma Whelan is perfect for the part, and where is it written that Asha is a smoking-hot-warrior-kraken-princess? She was described as relatively attractive, is all.I loved the cliffhanger. BLOODY LOVED IT. I had NO idea what was happening and have no idea what will happen next!I am a HUGE fan of the books, but I'm open minded when it comes to the deviations, because changes are necessary at times. That doesn't mean I want them to change much, but this was a great deviation. I always, always wanted to see what Craster was doing with the babies, what the Others were doing with them, how it went down. The scene made perfect sense and was totally in keeping with Jon's character.I actually don't think it will change the Flight from the Fist situation at all. Craster doesn't die via Ghost, Jeor gets Jon back, Craster angrily sends the watch on their way, STILL pregnant Gilly stays with him (it was obviously not her baby he gave to the others). After the Fist they all come crawling back (vastly depleted numbers), he lets them stay (because he benefits greatly from his friendship with the watch, and has calmed down a bit now. Also, no Jon by this point.) then... we all know what happens /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' /> .

1223	Targh	2012-04-15	It seemed pretty obvious that they wanted to dramatise Jon's finding out that the Night's Watch already know about Craster giving his sons to the Others.
1224	Ygrette	2012-04-27	I don't know if I like it or not, but yeah, had to explain the blue-eyes to my other aswell. Yes, I watch it with my mother.Best. Typo. Ever. /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
1225	Quiet Isle	2012-09-14	I prefer the show to be as faithful to the book as possible. While it's cool to see the Others take a sacrifice, do you really think Craster is stupid enough to do it over the night that 200 Night's Watch are visiting? And whose baby is this now?  Are the babies sacrificed?  what if they are joined with trees to create more 'OTHERS'?  and remember there is only ONE GREAT OTHER, and he she it is CONSTANTLY AT WAR with RH'OLLOR.
1226	Sir Klapek	2012-11-19	Are the babies sacrificed?  what if they are joined with trees to create more 'OTHERS'? Old Nan said about WW: "... They hunted the maids through frozen forests, and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children ..."
1227	King Beyond The Wall	2012-04-13	Why on earth did they have to go and kill Rakharo?
I don't remember him dying anywhere in ACOK.
It's ok when they don't mention at all a character or replace him with someone else (like the Ironhand guy, or the Black fish and so many others...) but killing someone who wasn't supposed to...
I don't know, it upsets me!!!
1228	spork	2012-04-15	Because the actor, Elyes Gabel, moved on to other projects (World War Z). I think most people were sad to see him go.
1229	All Men Must Rhyme	2012-04-17	Wonder how they're going to fix this. Pretty sure Rakharo had a pretty important role even as late as Dance. STOP KILLING THE IMPORTANT DOTHRAKI!!!
1230	Old Man Aegon	2012-04-17	heres the thing. The TV audience wont remember the name of rahkaro or Mago by the time they become really relevant so it's easy to replace them with dothrakhi's with other names, Theres so many story lines and character for each story that people like that are hard for the audience to remember properly.
1231	teemo	2012-04-17	I was more curious as to why they killed Silver than Rahkaro.
1232	LuisDantas	2012-04-17	Horses are difficult to direct.  And time-consumingas well, I assume.  The series rarely shows horses when it can reasonably avoid it.
Also, in this specific case it would be quite a challenge to respect the horse's well-being without making it appear too healthy for the situation.
1233	boojam	2012-04-17	I was more curious as to why they killed Silver than Rahkaro.I will second that. They needed some kind of melodrama in the 1st episode ?Not really, no particular plot advancement there.We don't even see Cat arrive at Rendly's camp on horse, I know there are some in E4... There is a particular scene coming up that gonna look diminished if Dany is on foot.I have seen and read stories of how , well modern directors and producers, don't like the problems horse cause with production shoots, and that's movies, even dogs.Must not have bothered John Ford.
1234	brzibrzi	2012-04-18	Because the actor, Elyes Gabel, moved on to other projects (World War Z). I think most people were sad to see him go.They could've replaced him easily, nobody would've noticed. I know i wouldn't, I wouldn't even know his name if i hadn't read the books.I'm guessing they had another reason to kill him, can't imagine why, though.
1235	spork	2012-04-18	I think they took advantage of him leaving to create some emotional import. So far that and the silver dying is all that's happened in dany's story so far this season. Also, recasting can be cheesy, and there are lots of people who liked the actor. There is even a small contingent of Rakharo/Irri 'shippers.
1236	jugdesh258	2012-04-18	I hope that is all we hear of it.  I doubt they needed any closure because a minor character quit.  He could have just dissappeared without mention.
The change is problematic in that one might believe that it is a setup for future retribution against the Dothraki that does not occur in the book.  They might replace an enemy that Dany does encounter for sake not needing new location

1237	lightbringer333	2012-04-18	why they killed rakharo.?? nothing in book mentioned. he was very good character.
1238	Kyle Foster	2012-04-18	hahaha if this upsets you then you might want to stop watching now, it only get's more and more intense.
1239	The Non-Human	2012-04-20	Meh, I was disappointed too.  I rather liked the actor, too. I also found it quite cheap. I mean, I cared about the character but those sentiments came mostly from the book. His show-dead was only a disappointing annoyance, not dramatic at all.
1240	Voshed	2012-04-23	Theres nothing like the old 'Head in the Bag', scene to give a boring storyline some bite...and a bit of good old wailing always helps.
As far as poor old Silver's concerned....well .... /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' /> Horse Burgers will keep the group going for quite a while...got to be practical....
it was either that of Dragon Kebebs and they wouldnt have fed nearly as many.......as well as stuffing the story up altogether .. /dunce.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunce:' /> .
1241	Acetabularia	2012-05-06	Hmmm, personally I feel that this is quite a big deal. I mean don't her Bloodriders have a role to play in the negotiation in Meeren, as hostages? Also, WHY would anyone want to kill off Silver? That is one of Dany's ties to Drogo! Almost every time Silver is mentioned in the book she remembers Drogo and draws strength from that!
1242	Quiet Isle	2012-09-14	I will second that. They needed some kind of melodrama in the 1st episode ?Not really, no particular plot advancement there.We don't even see Cat arrive at Rendly's camp on horse, I know there are some in E4...There is a particular scene coming up that gonna look diminished if Dany is on foot.I have seen and read stories of how , well modern directors and producers, don't like the problems horse cause with production shoots, and that's movies, even dogs.Must not have bothered John Ford.  Martin has said that one of the things he really misses having on set are HORSES!  His knights are supposed to be riding horses!  But he said the locations all over the place, and the cost and the production problems of making them do what they are supposed to in a scene were too much.  Westerns took place in a limited area, and where horses were aplenty.  Not so in this series.
1243	acedrian	2012-09-26	Martin has said that one of the things he really misses having on set are HORSES!  His knights are supposed to be riding horses!

Westerns took place in a limited area, and where horses were aplenty.  Not so in this series.indeed. I found the battle for Kings Landing particularly difficult with everyone on foot.
1244	Lord Hodor	2012-04-09	I really enjoyed the first scene we get on pyke, from brother-sister groping, disturbing but contextually sound, to sad Theon watching father and sister walk out on him.
I might have missed it but is Asha`s name ever mentioned in the scene? At first she didn`t introduce herself to Theon, then at the throne portion when she hugs Balon all Theon says is... "Yara?".
Having read the books I know who she is and that she is in fact not called Yara, but to non book readers was that made clear enough? Nobody that I noticed said Asha, so I`m wondering if people have any idea who that girl really is.
1245	Jerritus	2012-04-10	Yara = Asha. The producers of the show just take watchers for utter idiots and thus think they might confuse Asha and Osha.
1246	Tourniquet	2012-04-10	It's funny because we barely ever heard Osha called Osha. They could have changed her name this season and none would be the wiser...
1247	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-10	I don't buy that producers changed the name only because Asha sounds like Osha when Yara sounds like Arya.  The only thing I can think is that at some point Asha and Osha will be on screen together and in that case, perhaps it could be weird to have characters calling out "Asha and Osha" in the same sentence.  But I think GRRM chooses the names of his characters quite deliberately and D&D would be deliberate in choosing names as well so maybe there's something to Asha's name change being an anagram of Arya.
1248	_Oberyn_	2012-04-10	I though Yara was a bad name but said out loud it sounds atrocious. And it being an anagram to Arya it just proves the lack of imagination of the writers rather the some secret subplot. One more reason this pillocks should not try to reinvent the wheel.
1249	Travy1991	2012-04-10	I refuse to call the TV character Yara. There is no reason for changing that character's name...if you're a fan of GOT or ASOIAF...then you have a big enough attention span so as not to confuse Asha and Osha. This isn't a show for the casual viewer. I'm going to refer to Gemma Whelan's character as Asha regardless of what she's called on TV.
1250	chapter11studios	2012-04-10	Travvy1991, I am in total agreement. Asha it is. And that said, I wasn't crazy about the actress playin her, either.
1251	David C. Hunter	2012-04-10	Its not that big a deal yall
1252	Ran	2012-04-10	It's silly of us, but our policy in our reviews and news items at Westeros is to call her Asha. The powers that be want to be silly, we can be silly right back.
1253	Ser Dermett Corbray	2012-04-10	I guess it was the same reasoning that had them change Robert (who got his name from his father's ward, the King no less) into Robin.
Doesn't bother that much really. Thought the actress was just about okay. Wish they'd included to feast scene where she catches knives out of mid air though. Put that point about her being "one of the guys" and a real tough fighter across.
1254	Tyler Snow	2012-04-10	She wasn't what I had envisioned for Asha either. Also thought she was going to cut her little brother feeling her up a lot quicker than she did.
1255	Jerritus	2012-04-10	I guess it was the same reasoning that had them change Robert (who got his name from his father's ward, the King no less) into Robin.Doesn't bother that much really. Thought the actress was just about okay. Wish they'd included to feast scene where she catches knives out of mid air though. Put that point about her being "one of the guys" and a real tough fighter across. But at least that annoying little brat was already called "Sweetrobin" or whatever by his mum, so that change isnt all that big.Asha into Yara makes no sense really. I mean, it's easy to confuse names in books, but in TV series, where we actually see the people, it's not that easy to confuse two people with no resemblance whatsoever, just because they have similar names. And they won't even be together in at least another 5 seasons or so, if ever. D:
1256	Lord Hodor	2012-04-10	So I see. Asha is Yara in the series. I thought he was refering to her "fake" name she might have given him when offered to take him to the castle.
Changing her name from Asha to Yara is so ridiculous it never even crossed my mind, alas, HBO.
I wonder if they`ll ruin ASoIaF as bad as they did the "Sookie Stackhouse" novels.
Considering the porn paralel I fear for what`s to come.
1257	Crown	2012-04-10	It was awkward when Balon called her Yara, even though I knew he would. Also, I expected her to be prettier, but that's just my imagination.
1258	Travy1991	2012-04-10	Its not that big a deal yallI actually hate those fans that complain over minor details but changing Asha's name just irks me to no end. I know it's only a name but for a character who plays a fairly major role in the book series, it sort of strips some of the character from her when they change her name. Maybe I'm naive but when an author gives a character a name, I believe it means something and taking that away sort of tarnishes things a bit for me. Of course, I won't give up on the show or the character over a name change (by the way, I like the actress...it's a bit too early to tell but I think she can really grow into the role) but I just would rather call her by her book name because the show name changes nothing, it only insults the audiences intelligence.So I see. Asha is Yara in the series. I thought he was refering to her "fake" name she might have given him when offered to take him to the castle.Changing her name from Asha to Yara is so ridiculous it never even crossed my mind, alas, HBO.I wonder if they`ll ruin ASoIaF as bad as they did the "Sookie Stackhouse" novels.Considering the porn paralel I fear for what`s to come.I don't think it well ever get as bad as True Blood. Unlike Alan Ball who seemed to only like the premise of the Sookie Stackhouse Novels, David and Dan seem really into Martin's world. I think they will stick fairly true to the spirit of the books. I'm sure there will be things here and there that won't appear right but I don't think it will ever completely twist away from the world, story or characters GRRM created. Oh and of course there will be nudity...it is HBO.
1259	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-10	I guess it was the same reasoning that had them change Robert (who got his name from his father's ward, the King no less) into Robin.Robert Arryn is called Robin in the books so they aren't exactly changing his name.  They are just eliminating the need to explain a nickname.  Furthermore, Robin sounds like Robert and Robb is a shortened version of Robert so why didn't they completely change all the characters names if they sounded too much alike?  Why didn't they call Asha Esgred since she calls herself that in the books at one point? True, in the end it does not really make much of a difference whether she's called Asha or Yara in the show but it would be interesting to know exactly why they chose to explain the name change by saying it sounded too much like Osha and why they chose Yara when it sounds too much like Arya.
1260	CrypticWeirwood	2012-04-10	You Americans donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t understand, because the American pronunciations of Asha and Osha are so far apart, and you arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t used to un-American accents. But the British pronunciations are quite close:Asha: U.S. /ËA¦EÉ<U+0099>/, U.K. /ËÉ<U+0091>ËEÉ<U+0099>/ Osha: U.S. /ËÉ<U+0094>ËEÉ<U+0099>/, U.K. /ËÉ<U+0092>ËEÉ<U+0099>/Sure, TV audiences would hear the difference between /ËA¦EÉ<U+0099>/ and /ËÉ<U+0094>ËEÉ<U+0099>/ in a trice, because what you do with your mouth for the initial sounds of both words is so far apart.  But they arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t using American accents in this show! Theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re using (various) U.K. accents.  And nobody is going to hear a big difference between /ËÉ<U+0091>ËEÉ<U+0099>/ and /ËÉ<U+0092>ËEÉ<U+0099>/ â<U+0080><U+0094> because there really isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t one.  Those are nearly identical.See the problem at last?  Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s obvious, really.And no, Arya and Yara are not close together at all.

1261	PatrickStormborn	2012-04-10	Perhaps Alfie Allen -- who will be interacting with both Yara and Osha this season -- pronounced the two names quite similarly? Because if so it would be confusing for viewers.Of course it's frustrating that the name has been changed. But it's not a big deal. It's not going to affect your enjoyment of the books.
1262	Lord Hodor	2012-04-10	You Americans donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t understand, because the American pronunciations of Asha and Osha are so far apart, and you arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t used to un-American accents.

Did the british edition of the books come with a different name?What about parts of the world where English is not the main language? Should we get different names too?Names are names. They are what they are, not for changing purposes. Unless its a different alphabet and therefore unppronouncable it shouldn`t be changed.
1263	Milcov	2012-04-10	So the reasoning is the name is too similar to Osha, well it's not like people have ever had the same name is it?
Jon Snow has never been confused with Jon Arryn
Robb Stark was never confused with Robert Baratheon
And seriously could no one figure out that Osha (the captured wildling prisoner) is a different person from Asha (Theon's sister and Ironorn princess)
1264	CrypticWeirwood	2012-04-10	Right, and the rest of the world cares because? Did the british edition of the books come with a different name?Names are names. They are what they are, not for changing purposes. Unless its a different alphabet and therefore unppronouncable it shouldn`t be changed.Huh?  A different alphabet doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t make something unpronounceable. I havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t the least problem in the world pronouncing  ÎLÎII<U+0085>I<U+0086>Î<U+00BF>I<U+0082>, á1I<U+0087>Î1Î»Î»ÎµI<U+008D>I<U+0082>, or á1Î´I<U+0085>IIÎµI<U+008D>I<U+0082>.And what are you talking about by saying â<U+0080><U+009C>names are namesâ<U+0080><U+009D>?  Readers quickly discern similar but different spellings seen frequently, but listeners will not quickly distinguish words that sound very close when spoken (and heard comparatively seldom!) on the screen without any lexical clues.  This has nothing to do with spellings, but only with  pronunciations, which always follow the speakerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s accent.   Sounds matter, not letters. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s having the same sounds that makes them nearly indistinguishable quasi-homophones.   They cannot use the American pronunciations, because those would make no sense in a show whose native speakers all have British pronunciations. Notice how Viserys pronounced â<U+0080><U+009C>dynastyâ<U+0080><U+009D> as U.K. /ËdÉanÉ<U+0099>stÉa/ in the show rather than as U.S. /ËdaÉanÉ<U+0099>stÉa/.  They had to use the British pronunciation there. It would have been inauthentic to use  twangy American pronunciations, which means they would have been stuck   with the near-homophones /ËÉ<U+0091>ËEÉ<U+0099>/ and /ËÉ<U+0092>ËEÉ<U+0099>/ .  No one would have heard the difference, because the rounding of the open back rounded vowel  /É<U+0092>/ is the only think that distinguishes it from from the open back unrounded vowel /É<U+0091>/. Roundedness is a trait that varies between speakers, and it simply would not have come across as sufficiently distinctive.

1265	Lord Hodor	2012-04-10	What I mean by Names are names is, if my name is Rob, I wouldnt want to be called Harris somewhere else because Rob may be confused with Robbin.
I`m not arguing the pronunciation is different, im arguing that similar or not, it should not be changed, it`s a person`s name, you dont have to like it, just go with it.
1266	CrypticWeirwood	2012-04-10	Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s simple, really: Names that were different for readers should not suddenly become the same for listeners. If they hadnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t changed them, they would have.  The author gave the two characters different names; it would have been wrong for the screenwriters to change that and give them now the same names.  So of course they didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t.  They made sure the two characters still had different names.
1267	Hyper	2012-04-10	I actually hate those fans that complain over minor details but changing Asha's name just irks me to no end.

A name is just a name. The only meaning it has is what YOU have assigned to it. It is not intrinsic to the character itself.Asha - Yara - Whatever. It is a good character. The name is a *minor detail*. If the portrayal of the character is up to par (and it seems to be so far), few will care.

1268	White Raven	2012-04-10	I refuse to call the TV character Yara. There is no reason for changing that character's name...if you're a fan of GOT or ASOIAF...then you have a big enough attention span so as not to confuse Asha and Osha. This isn't a show for the casual viewer. I'm going to refer to Gemma Whelan's character as Asha regardless of what she's called on TV.This.A casual viewer probably wouldn't know Osha's name anyway. And I can't remember: Was Osha ever adressed by her name in the series?
1269	Lord Hodor	2012-04-10	Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s simple, really: Names that were different for readers should not suddenly become the same for listeners. If they hadnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t changed them, they would have.  The author gave the two characters different names; it would have been wrong for the screenwriters to change that and give them now the same names.  So of course they didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t.  They made sure the two characters still had different names.Like they did with Jon Snow and Jon Arryn right?
1270	kephv	2012-04-10	You have to know her name! They told us she was Yara, but that was a lie. Her name is Asha.
1271	The Black Wolf	2012-04-10	Like they did with Jon Snow and Jon Arryn right? I think the point CrypticWeirwood is trying to make is that, for instance, Jon Snow and Jon Arryn did have the same name in the book, but Osha and Asha didn't. And while the names are perfectly distinguishable in writing, they might not be when heard spoken by a character on the TV show. Apart from the possibility of it being confusing to the average viewer, this would probably raise some questions, like: why does a character from north of The Wall have the same name as a character from the Iron Islands?I don't particularly like the change, but it doesn't really bother me either...

1272	Maester Bater	2012-04-10	You have to know her name! They told us she was Yara, but that was a lie. Her name is Asha. "It is," my sister had said, so softly that I was afraid that she might cry.
1273	Envie	2012-04-10	It's funny because we barely ever heard Osha called Osha. They could have changed her name this season and none would be the wiser...This. I'm not sure what producer's meeting got together and decided it would be a better idea to change Asha to Yara (which sounds like a stupid name IMO) than to change Osha to something else. In most readers / fans opinion, Asha's role in the story is pretty significant. While yes, Osha does accompany Bran and Rickon north beyond the wall, I don't feel she's as politically an important character and her name could have been easier to change without as much confusion or fan criticism.
1274	howland_reed	2012-04-10	I think the confusion will come when Theon returns to Winterfell and will obviously confront and probably try and bed Osha.  At that point, I can understand why producers feel she needs a different sounding name from Theon's sister.
My main problem with the name change is not the name change itself, but that Yara is just so phonetically different that it's hard to accept.  It also sounds softer and more feminine, I dunno, which doesn't really suit Asha's character.  I would've been fine with a change if they at least chose a name that's at least similar sounding to Asha.  Why not Ashara?  Or even Aisha?  Or why not just Ashe, which is more androgynous, but could still be used for females?
Yara sucks.
1275	Giskard Reventlov	2012-04-10	Yeah, Yara sucks big time and it surely would be better if they have changed Osha's name who is minor character in the books compared to Asha.
1276	turdle	2012-04-10	i couldn't care less about the name change. what i was disappointed with was the fact that she shows none of the wit that asha has.  granted, it's such a short time frame that they used, but the whole turn on for theon in the book, is how witty asha is.  when i asked my girlfriend what she thought of her, her only response was "gross."  especially after show craster and his daughters just last week, i get the feeling that a lot of people are just going to assume the greyjoys are into incest, as opposed to asha allowing theon to make a fool of himself.
1277	Leto Atreides	2012-04-10	It was awkward when Balon called her Yara, even though I knew he would. Also, I expected her to be prettier, but that's just my imagination.Me too, I was a bit suprised by how plain she looked. I was expecting her to be prettier since in the book, Theon doesn't recognize her because she has turned into such a beautiful women while he had memories of an ugly duckling.
1278	Milcov	2012-04-10	It's not even a problem if the names sound the same though. Most people would learn quickly enough that Osha and Asha are different characters by how they look and their different interactions with Theon.
1279	Ser Ilyn's Tongue	2012-04-10	I love the books and I love the show.  But they are separate entities and although name changes etc are a bit irritating they're nothing worse than that.
However, I don't understand why they changed Asha's name and not Osha's.  As Asha is a POV character from the books she will, most likely, be in the show a lot more than Osha.  
And I agree that Yara is so similar to Arya that the whole name change seems a little pointless.
1280	JW.	2012-04-10	Me too, I was a bit suprised by how plain she looked. I was expecting her to be prettier since in the book, Theon doesn't recognize her because she has turned into such a beautiful women while he had memories of an ugly duckling.I suspect the make up is the reason, the actress headshots and other google pictures she is actually quite cute. I had hoped they would have kept the shorter hair in though, as Asha has in the books.
1281	Ser Ilyn's Tongue	2012-04-10	I thought they've cast her well, though.  She was pretty good in the scenes she was in and I can see her being a convincing sea captain.  I look forward to seeing more of her
1282	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-10	You Americans donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t understand, because the American pronunciations of Asha and Osha are so far apart, and you arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t used to un-American accents. But the British pronunciations are quite close:Asha: U.S. /ËA¦EÉ<U+0099>/, U.K. /ËÉ<U+0091>ËEÉ<U+0099>/ Osha: U.S. /ËÉ<U+0094>ËEÉ<U+0099>/, U.K. /ËÉ<U+0092>ËEÉ<U+0099>/Sure, TV audiences would hear the difference between /ËA¦EÉ<U+0099>/ and /ËÉ<U+0094>ËEÉ<U+0099>/ in a trice, because what you do with your mouth for the initial sounds of both words is so far apart.  But they arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t using American accents in this show! Theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re using (various) U.K. accents.  And nobody is going to hear a big difference between /ËÉ<U+0091>ËEÉ<U+0099>/ and /ËÉ<U+0092>ËEÉ<U+0099>/ â<U+0080><U+0094> because there really isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t one.  Those are nearly identical.See the problem at last?  Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s obvious, really.And no, Arya and Yara are not close together at all.It's not obvious, really.  For one, name pronunciation guides are fairly meaningless.  I've heard the name Asha pronounced a half dozen different ways by Americans, Brits, and Australians alike.  People will pronounce it as they will pronounce it.  Second, there are vast regional variations with vowel pronunciation.  The vowels of people from Leeds do not always sound like the vowels of people from London.  Further, the show is not using either pronunciation of Osha you listed above.  This part of your argument does not apply.Yara does sound like Arya...depending on how it's pronounced.  Both Sansa and Arya are given numerous pronunciations on the show and sometimes the same actor pronounces these names two different ways in the same scene!  Now that was initially confusing.  The most startling pronunciation for Arya I've heard has come from Cat.  When she says the name, it sounds very similar to the way Theon says Yara. The Black Wolf offered one of the most reasonable explanations for the name change; how to explain that a character from north of the wall has a similar name to a character from the iron islands. I can agree with that reason for changing the name.But it still begs the question of why they chose Yara!  Why not Ashaon?  Why not Allanys or Gwynesse after other women from the Iron Islands?  Why not Esgred, the name Asha uses to deceive Theon?  Does the name Yara have some sort of significance or was it just some humorous play with anagrams?
1283	PatrickStormborn	2012-04-10	I love the books and I love the show.  But they are separate entities and although name changes etc are a bit irritating they're nothing worse than that.However, I don't understand why they changed Asha's name and not Osha's.  As Asha is a POV character from the books she will, most likely, be in the show a lot more than Osha.Not really. I doubt Asha will be in many episodes this season, whereas it looks like Osha has a fairly large role in the Winterfell story.And I agree that Yara is so similar to Arya that the whole name change seems a little pointless. The difference is that Theon is not interacting with both Yara and Arya. He is, however, going to be interacting with both Osha and Asha.
1284	Davos55	2012-04-10	I don't care for the name change either. I know that GRRM said that now because of the first season that Osha is going to play a bigger role in TWOW, and as someone stated, Theon will interact with Osha later this season. Yara does sound very strange though, but oh well!
What is more important is that I am definitely not sold on her yet in the show. She did not look or sound at all like I envisioned so far, and I came out very unimpressed by her. I hope this will change, and I am sure the next episode will tell more considering the title of the episode.
1285	sennahoj	2012-04-10	I think Asha was described prettier in the books than Yara now turned out in the series. I don't mean that disrespectfully to the actress portraying her, I guess it is a question of make up and costume, and I actually think it works better. For her to command men at sea and in battle and have their respect, she needs to be tough and hardened rather than pretty. A woman who appears too attractive might have difficulties to convincingly play the part of a warrior woman in a male-dominated society such as Westeros. That doesn't mean attractive women could not play a tough fighter or leader, but with Emilia's Daenerys already falling into the warrior-queen category, audiences might find it hard to accept two beautiful amazon characters on one show, not to forget Arya, who, were she older, would make it three. As far as Asha/Yara is concerned, it will depend on the following episodes.
1286	The Meeraculous Third Reed	2012-04-10	One of the rare examples of poor casting in GOT. She simply is not attractive enough to play Asha. I understand that is crude and perhaps even a bit shallow, but I stand by it.

1287	boojam	2012-04-10	I really enjoyed the first scene we get on pyke, from brother-sister groping, disturbing but contextually sound, to sad Theon watching father and sister walk out on him.I might have missed it but is Asha`s name ever mentioned in the scene? At first she didn`t introduce herself to Theon, then at the throne portion when she hugs Balon all Theon says is... "Yara?".Having read the books I know who she is and that she is in fact not called Yara, but to non book readers was that made clear enough? Nobody that I noticed said Asha, so I`m wondering if people have any idea who that girl really is.I really wonder if it was D&D who did the change, hopefully it's higher up.Well went over this endlessly last year.I think the main conclusion was since D&D have such a good ear for all else why not a less awkward sounding name?The were a ton of suggestions all different from Osha that flowed with more melody.Sure hope George did not suggest the name.Maybe Theon will call her 'sis'.

This is Theon's description from ACOK, when he first sees her: (before knowing her as his sister)"He liked what he saw. Ironborn, he knew at a glance; lean and long-legged, with black hair cut short, wind-chafed skin, strong sure hands, a dirk at her belt. Her nose was too big and too sharp for her thin face, but her smile made up for it."I don't know about you guys, this seems like a fairly average looking woman. With a great smile. So far I think the casting works really well - this might even be a case of 'hollywood casting'. (actress being prettier than the character)

1289	Tywin's bastard	2012-04-10	People will rant about anything. CrypticWeirwood had a good roundup of why it's understandable. There were people mixing up names in the first season, where the names weren't that similar, so there's definitely a problem for some people. GRRM has also said himself that there's an unwritten rule that you don't name characters too similarly but that he ran out of names after a while because he had a ton of characters.
Some here have also missed the fact that it's quite a lot easier to separate names when you see them spelled in a book, rather to when you just hear them. Especially when it's completely new (fictional) names. I don't have any problems with it myself but I've come to realize that it's not very bright to assume that everyone sees things just like I do.
As for the name, I think it works. Yara sounds pretty harsh, while still clearly feminie, which works with the Ironborn setting.

So far I think the casting works really well - this might even be a case of 'hollywood casting'. (actress being prettier than the character)Thank you for looking this up, I appreciate it. I believe a lot of book fans have built up their image of Asha as some sort of saucy sexy vixen type woman by our modern day standards. I never expected her to be that, but I think I do understand why some of the guys dislike the looks of the actress chosen to play Asha.It's not really that the actor is not good looking, its that she's not playing Asha in the witty, sharp-tongued strong willed way that was described in the books and why so many readers came to love her so well. To me, the actress has a dull heavy-lidded and insolent look about her. It's an arrogant look that doesn't come across as confident, but rather, entitled, cruel and bitchy. I'm not sure if this is how the actress is interpreting the script or not. Perhaps that's how the directors want her to act but I've heard many people say they're not really jiving with it from their book impressions of Asha. I don't think its attractive and almost makes the viewer wonder if maybe Theon's definitely the one being wronged. Perhaps that's what they want the viewer to think.
1291	snax	2012-04-10	I was more distracted by her terrible posture than by her name change. She did have swagger though; I'll give her that.
1292	Hear Us Roar	2012-04-10	Yara = Asha. The producers of the show just take watchers for utter idiots and thus think they might confuse Asha and Osha.it is very easy to confuse them. I got in to this series by watching season one, then i went out and read all the books. before i read the books the names of the characters were very hard to follow. Other than the main ones, it is easy to forget the names of minor characters that this show is littered with. So it makes perfect sense to change the name, they changed the name not the character.To the folks saying Asha was described as prettier, it was just your imagination. If recall it is said that she has a large nose, which is also very thing ad a large jaw. The actress looks the part but was uglied up with makeup so it is not an offense on her

1293	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-10	I didn't have an exact image of what Asha looked like in my head, but I definitely found her character attractive due to her confidence, her spunk, and her cunning wit.  I didn't get any of those things with Yara.  The character lost all non-physical attractive appeal because she was dull.
1294	Fredwin	2012-04-10	They could have easily said Osha was short for Oshanna and just added the Greyjoy at the end of Asha. I mean, there is precedent for using full names in the books. I'm looking at you Jon Snow, you know nothing.

1297	Slingingstones	2012-04-10	I posted the following in another thread, but, I think it more appropriate here:Yara/Asha's (Ms. Whelan) look is what I expected of a strong female sea captain, nine years before the mast, commanding a tough crew and having killed men in close combat. It tends to mess up one's mascara and lipstick. bathing in salt water toughens your hide and frizzes your curls; and, beneath all that a body to arouse a long lost brother. It really doesn't say much for Theon though, who would screw a snake if someone would hold it's head...or, screw a pile of rocks if he thought a snake was hiding therein.

1299	Envie	2012-04-10	Really? Really? Posture? Is that what nipickers are resorting to these days?I think he's trying to say what I elaborated on - the woman playing Asha seemed slouchy and insolent, like a petulant teenage girl sneering because Daddy likes her best... it wasn't portrayed the way Asha was in the books. Asha was very proud, very in your face, feisty and full of herself. There's a difference between confidence and insolence. I don't care if this "Yara" is blonde and plain faced at all... I care that she acts like a spoiled brat instead of the confident sea captain Asha knew she was.
1300	Pliny	2012-04-10	She wasn't as I'd pictured her, but neither are any of the Lannisters (and they look better as portrayed in the tv show).
What bothered me about this exchange was the physical affection between Asha/Yara and Balon Greyjoy. I just didn't imagine him as a hugging type. Maybe it's in the books and I missed it, but I thought of him as cold and hard, like his Seastone Chair.
I think Theon's struggle with trying to belong comes across well, and that's probably the most important thing.
1301	Lebronn Jaime	2012-04-10	It's nice that we've come back around to hating a casting because an actor isn't attractive enough. I was worried for society when we complained that the actor playing Brienne wasn't as ugly as described in the book. I'm releaved to see that we're still as shallow as ever.Thankfully some people know that the real injustice here is the loathsome name change. I know that's what will irk me when I watch her scenes in the coming years, and not that she doesn't turn me on enough.
1302	Ser Sweets	2012-04-11	You have to know her name! They told us she was Yara, but that was a lie. Her name is Asha. That was wonderful.Regardless, my initial reaction to the name change was something of disbelief. I had to put on headphones and watch it over just in the vain hope that Theon's actor had pronounced 'Asha' badly. No deal.After reading this thread and taking note of some of the comments about pronunciations of names sounding quite different from how names are read, my horror has been sated. Somewhat.I still think it was unnecessary. Of all the changes the tv show has made, this is somehow one of the ones which bugs me more. It just reminds me sourly of bad anime dubbing in the 90's.I think that physically, Ya-sha looks good. The hair is really the only thing I had any kind of issue with. She wasn't supposed to be beautiful and her nose is -- well, proportionate, but hawklike enough to suit the character.Her cockiness and coarseness is there, but I do hope we get to see more examples of her wit and she doesn't come across as some 'daddy's little princess with dirks'.

1304	Tywin's bastard	2012-04-11	The name change was really unexpected and strange IMO.That Asha isn't a hottie doesn't annoy me one bit, she isn't supposed to be. But I'd imagined her as more angular and sinewy, the person portraying her looks almost pudgy, doesn't she?We should be way past being disturbed by such details since almost all the characters on the show look a bit different from what's described in the book.

He's been fucking Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and Moonboy, for all I know.Seeing how we just that episode saw Theon fucking the Sailor's daughter, who looked perfectly goofy and unattractive, 'Yara' would look like a model in comparison.I think the attractiveness level is about right. Yes there are a few discrepencies but, as Tywin's Bastard said, we should be beyond shock for little details like face shapes.

1308	Sadie Stark	2012-04-11	Hey, 
I do agree on this one, I really don't see why they needed to play with her name. This is the first time I've seen the series after reading the book, so for me its a bit hard to see all the bits they added in and the 'changes' they've made for whatever reason. 
It would be good to pick the scriptwriters brains to see why they have done this. 
In my heart she will always be Asha lol

What a surpriseTris is madly in love with herThe last three I'm not particular sure of but I'm sure lots of people in Westeros would want to do a King's daughter.And Asha shouldn't be incredibly sexy, she has to look like a sea captain. Besides some characters have to be noticeably more attractive than others, Cersei should look beautiful, as should Margaery, Dany and Sansa to leave something up in the air for the 'beautiful young Queen' of Maggy's prophecy.The Theon argument can go either way admittedly as he's more interested in getting wet than what the girl looks like. I might even reluctantly give you Tris (though I still maintain that even he would require some physical attraction), the rest though are simply not viable. Asha's crew presumably rape and pillage as much as the next number of Ironborn. Asha is also not the only woman on the ship I don't think. Either way, the point remains that half of the crew are not attracted to her for the sole reason of her being on the ship.The "wanting to nob a princess" thing also goes both ways. Yes there is a status thing, but again, people won't be queuing up to marry Shireen when she comes of age. Asha is clearly attractive. Not ZOMG hot, but attractive. The actress in question isn't. Anyway, I imagine I shall get tedious continuing to make this point, so I shall let it lie, particularly as most of the casting has been excellent. Though finally, Asha's wiki page provides a good indicator of how I imagine her to be.
1310	boojam	2012-04-11	I think Asha was described prettier in the books than Yara now turned out in the series. From the novel I got the picture of the Iron Born as kind of faded 'pirate' look, glad they did not do that.On the other hand calculated shabbiness is ok to a point... but I don't know.It's odd , have seen Gemma with minimal makeup and while she's not Helen of Troy, she looked fine.I noticed is 202 her pants and boots , what is that a jerkin of sorts? Figured her to be wearing that.And she had the 'Iron countenance' , Gemma is a good actress. But that hair... now that's just a little too shabby-stringy. If she wore it short ... that would be an improvement.
1311	howland_reed	2012-04-11	It's really amazing how so many readers have build up Asha's beauty when reading the books. Some practically think she is a tomboy version of Dany/Cersei. BUT this is far from the case. This is Theon's description from ACOK, when he first sees her: (before knowing her as his sister)"He liked what he saw. Ironborn, he knew at a glance; lean and long-legged, with black hair cut short, wind-chafed skin, strong sure hands, a dirk at her belt. Her nose was too big and too sharp for her thin face, but her smile made up for it."I don't know about you guys, this seems like a fairly average looking woman. With a great smile. So far I think the casting works really well - this might even be a case of 'hollywood casting'. (actress being prettier than the character)Is that quote supposed to support your argument?  Cause Gemma Whelan does not fit a single description of that Asha.I'll reserve further judgment cause Mark Addy didn't fit the description of King Robert, nor did Michelle Fairley for Catelyn Tully (although that was just mainly aging her up), but both actors have been phenomenal in their role.  Perhaps Whelan can do the same.But at least from the few scenes we've seen of her (which were way too rushed), this Asha is coming off as cold and grim.  As someone earlier mentioned, her "swagger" comes across as more cruel and entitled, rather than confident.  Asha in the books is brash and bold, while also being playful with genuine warmth beneath her more brazen exterior.  I'm hoping the later episodes develop her in the same way.Regardless though, she looks nothing like the Asha described in the books, and no, we weren't expecting a Megan Fox level of hotness.  But the actress really is not that attractive.  The actresses playing Ygritte and Osha are much better looking than Asha, which is a shame considering those two are not exactly described that favorably in the books.In fact, Natalia Tena (Osha) would have been a much better casting for Asha, and she's not exactly a knockout stunner.

1312	Slingingstones	2012-04-11	No offense intended, but gentlemen and ladies, speaking as a retired merchant mariner, and having been through the hawse pipe a couple of times,Yara/Asha (Gemma Whelan) looks just fine.
1313	Ser Sweets	2012-04-11	In fact, Natalia Tena (Osha) would have been a much better casting for Asha, and she's not exactly a knockout stunner.Actually, to that I agree. Osha's actress has the Asha look.But perhaps this is all an an elaborate series of actions brought upon by paranoia that we will all think Osha and Asha are the same person!After all, the epileptic Lord of the Vale is most definitely the same guy who managed to capture the Kingslayer. Their names are so similar!

Cause Gemma Whelan does not fit a single description of that AshaNo, the quote was simply to illustrate that Asha in the book is not a tomboy version of Helen of Troy that many fans have built up in their heads.While Gemma does not fit the literal description, her 'attractiveness level' is right, IMO. As for personality matching, we'll have to wait and see. But I liked what I saw in this episode.

1315	CrypticWeirwood	2012-04-11	In Clash, Theon himself mentions how similar Asha and Oshaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s names are.
1316	Myrddin	2012-04-11	I can understand wanting to alter the name, but why not just tack on a consonant to "Asha"?TashaSasha(even) Yasha(why not) Basha, Casha, Dasha, Fasha, Gasha, Hasha, Jasha, Kasha, Lasha, Masha, Nasha, Pasha, Rasha, Vasha, Washa, or Zasha?"Yara" is not a big deal, really, but it seems like an odd name to choose.
1317	Milcov	2012-04-11	In Clash, Theon himself mentions how similar Asha and Oshaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s names are.And so what? If people can't distinguish between Theon's sister and princess of the Iron Islands and Osha, wildling captive of Winterfell then they shouldn't be watching anything more mature than the Tellytubbies.I suppose Jon Connington will be Keith Connington and Brynden Tully is too close to Brandon so he'll have to be Mark Tully the Blackfish. They could both be called Asha and there'd still be differences, such as Jon Arryn and Jon Snow
1318	Morrigan	2012-04-11	It's really amazing how so many readers have build up Asha's beauty when reading the books.So true, it's pathetic really. Glad that HBO didn't pander to the dorky idiots by having some uber-babe amazon vixen as Asha. That said, I DO agree that she lacked swagger and cockiness and I wasn't sold on the actress. But, it was only one episode, I'll give her time.Though we can of course counteract this with the following.Theon wants to do herHalf of her crew allegedly want to do herTris Botley still wants to do her many years on.Qarl the maid really likes doing her (is it said that he's good looking?)The Lysene sailor (the beautiful Lysene sailor, admittedly from Asha's viewpoint, but he is stated as beautiful none the less) liked doing her.Justin Massey wants to do her.Already refuted, and I'll add that her status AND her attitude has a lot more to it than you would expect. And as a real-life example, I give you Cleopatra. One of the most desired women in history, yet she was reportedly plain-looking (not ugly, but not head-turning "OMG BABE"); it was her charm, her wit, her voice and her charisma that made her so attractive.
1319	The Meeraculous Third Reed	2012-04-12	So true, it's pathetic really. Glad that HBO didn't pander to the dorky idiots by having some uber-babe amazon vixen as Asha.Er that's not what we're asking for.Already refuted,Hmm not really.And as a real-life example, I give you Cleopatra. One of the most desired women in history, yet she was reportedly plain-looking (not ugly, but not head-turning "OMG BABE"); it was her charm, her wit, her voice and her charisma that made her so attractive.There are also various sources who attest to her great beauty (including Plutarch, the guy who I assume you got the plain-looking quote from, one of the most unreliable ancient historians.)
1320	Vvornth	2012-04-12	Asha was never a "looker" so I don't mind the plain looks of the actress, what did bother me though was that she lacked some of the fire that we see of Asha in her original encounter with Theon, now she ended up just looking smug which felt somewhat wierd given the previous scene's incestous fondling.
1321	boojam	2012-04-12	But at least from the few scenes we've seen of her (which were way too rushed), this Asha is coming off as cold and grim.

Asha in the books is brash and bold, while also being playful with genuine warmth beneath her more brazen exterior.  I'm hoping the later episodes develop her in the same way.Seems to me D&D have 'grim-ified' Pyke more than Dragonstone in order to made a distinction, tho we really have not seen much of the places, wonder if we ever really will?Well Asha does not seem THAT grim and cold to me, but the thing about "swagger" and playful confidence , yeah, I thought that was very distinctive in Asha in the prose story. I know that actress can do it, so I lay the blame at D&D's doorstep...... as you say other actors came into their own as time went on.I think D&D have a 'screen time' problem with the Ironborn whose solution will be interesting to see.
1322	Blood Rider	2012-04-12	They've made her sound like a kids television program. 'Yara the Explorer' doesn't have a nice ring to it. They should have kept Asha.
1323	Insane DanniJay	2012-04-12	It's not a big deal to me her name isn't that important her acting and being the character is what matters. Besides Westeros can't be filled with good looking people in every corner. Honestly though I'm a bit surprised  Brienne is actually pretty but back to the point who cares if they don't go by the book; don't judge me though I love the books but I played it out a million times in my head when I read all of them. So I rather be surprised for once and see their vision of this series. And so far I haven't been let down but being honest Asha/Yara is not sexy but that's how it is.

She isn't a size zero, but she's still far from chubby or fat.Gotta disagree there. I'd call her pudgy on first viewing. Part of that might be that I expected a lean and athletic looking girl from the books. But even looking at the still photos right now, she looks pretty un-athletic. Nothing about her suggests that she's a dangerous athletic young woman who could take me out in battle. She looks more like a worn-down saltwife than a lean and hungry hunter.
1326	Knight of Ashes	2012-04-12	I just wanted to see Theon get turned on at the thought of his sister lactating.

I guess we'll find out Sunday!
1328	teemo	2012-04-12	The only way you get confidence and swagger like Asha has in the books, is if you have a certain level of physical attractiveness.Really?  So you have to be physically attractive to have confidence and swagger?  Ok.  I would say Olenna has confidence and swagger and she's like 100.

Maybe, un-atheletic, but you would only have a guess without seeing the actress elsewhere. What do you think she weighs, 100lbs?
1330	Buckwheat	2012-04-13	The name change is pretty annoying, they should give the audience more credit. No matter what the show would be good, even if you can't distinctly remember every characters name. They shouldn't dumb things down for the average viewer, because when you leave things the way Martin made them, it makes it enjoyable to re-watch episodes, because everytime, you catch more thing, things make more sense etc.One of the best things about aSoIaF, is the fact that GRRM doesn't dumb anything down for the casual reader, he rewards the dedicated fans, by trusting that they will figure it out. As a result of GRRM's writing, every reread is more enjoyable, because you get to see how connected and crazy awesome everything really is. So yes, the name change does bother me, because if they have to change things like that now, so "audiences are not confused", then they might as well give up now, because if the viewers can't figure out the names of characters, they will have no chance with the things that are actually complicated. So by changing Asha's name, it makes me very worried that they are going to continue making a bastardization of a great story, by dumbing down everything that makes the story so amazingly, complicatedly, awesome./agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' /> This so much. If they want to show an uncomplicated story, they apparently chose the wrong book.I keep calling her Asha, I will never think of her as Yara (which sounds like something else in my language).
1331	Ghost714	2012-04-13	Really?  So you have to be physically attractive to have confidence and swagger?  Ok.  I would say Olenna has confidence and swagger and she's like 100.Read what I said.... I didn't say you have to be physically attractive to have any swagger or confidence. I said "the only way you get confidence and swagger like Asha has in the books, is if you have a certain level of physical attractiveness". So again I am not talking about just any confidence or swagger, I am talking about the specific confidence and swagger that Asha has in the books. Way to go and quote part of my post to make me sound bad or something, I was saying that after a bunch of other stuff to argue that Asha in the books is attractive.I mean I am completely ready to defend what I said, surely you can see that Olenna Tyrell has a completely different level of confidence and "swagger", than Asha. They both use different means to get what they want, however they are both confident in those means, and I agree that they both have swagger, but a far different kind of swagger. You won't see Olenna using physical means to get what she wants, wether that's sexual means or martial force. Just like you won't see Asha using her social status to get what she wants.
1332	Ghost714	2012-04-13	Pudgy? Is that really the adjective you want to use here? Maybe, un-atheletic, but you would only have a guess without seeing the actress elsewhere. What do you think she weighs, 100lbs?I agree, Yara wasn't "pudgy", but she definitely did not look fit and athletic, like Asha looks in the books. I can not picture this Yara wielding two throwing axes at all, much less kicking major ass with them. I think just all out gross, would be more accurate than pudgy.
1333	Maginor	2012-04-13	I agree, Yara wasn't "pudgy", but she definitely did not look fit and athletic, like Asha looks in the books. I can not picture this Yara wielding two throwing axes at all, much less kicking major ass with them.

1334	lyvyathan	2012-04-13	So the reasoning is the name is too similar to Osha, well it's not like people have ever had the same name is it?Jon Snow has never been confused with Jon ArrynRobb Stark was never confused with Robert BaratheonAnd seriously could no one figure out that Osha (the captured wildling prisoner) is a different person from Asha (Theon's sister and Ironorn princess)Yeah, I didn't really get the change - I also don't know why they gave preference to an added non-canonical character rather than to a main text POV character.Heck even if they changed Osha's name in Season Two to "Wildgirl4202" or "Magyar" I don't think anyone would have noticed.
1335	lyvyathan	2012-04-13	And Asha shouldn't be incredibly sexy, she has to look like a sea captain.

This Yara has none of the fire, charisma, or wit that Asha has. I now know for a fact that Alfie Allen, the guy who plays Theon, is a good actor, because he had to act attracted to that bastardization of Asha. When Theon left Pyke to become Ned's ward, his sister was an ugly duckling, part of the reason he did not recognize Asha, is because she grew up to be a fairly attractive young woman. Yara is not attractive at all. My problem though isn't just with Yara not being attractive, it's the fact that she isn't attractive, and she doesn't look like she could Captain a ship full of Ironborn. She doesn't look or act like she is capapable, much less good at, leading raids and attacks. Nothing about Yara puts off the vibe that she could beat your ass, or seduce you, to get what she wants. I would be more scared of old Nan with a throwing axe, than I would this Yara.

Punch Balon?  Balon gave us her resume, whether or not she looks the part.  Quite frankly, Loras out of his armor doesn't look like much of a fighter...but there's only a handful that can best him.  book...cover...that whole thing.

She seems to have the frame , not to become a body builder, but some real physicality. Have already seen enough of her that I am really looking forward to her as Brienne next Sunday, she really takes the role seriously.Funny she said she cried when she had her hair cut, but at the DVD party she looks terrific in short hair.She and Gemma Whelan are friends, Asha does not do much weapons work for some while yet, so well have to see how her training goes. Putting an axe into somebody's head cuts through a lot of character complaints.

1341	Lord Hodor	2012-04-13	While I`m completly perplexed by the name change, the actress playing her dosen`t bother me at all.
In fact I liked the entire pike scene. I think the actress may lack the charisma we look for the leaders and commanders of the sort, she does look like she`s bored most of the time and not at all fiery. But I`m sure even George Washington wasn`t in commander mode 24/7. We`ll see how much commanding power she has when she`s actually commanding, not tricking her brother into groping her or huging her dad.
And if you think she`s ugly, well that`s too bad, I guess your Asha is ugly then. Mine isn`t a beauty queen, but she sure looks like she knows her way around the bedroom.
The name change though.. /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' />  Why? Oh why?

In this very thread plenty of posters wrote that the actress who plays Yara/Asha looks fine to them, and I agree with them. You make it sound like she's some deformed monstrosity that nobody ever could find attractive at all, which is ridiculous.
1343	Iotun	2012-04-13	Let's be honest a bit, Asha is such a stupid name anyway. Imagine the scene where Theon recognizes his sister, and him saying instead 'ASHA?!' instead of 'YARA?!'. Be honest with yourselves, Asha sounds lamer.

Like I said before though, it's not just the fact that she is not some what physically attractive like Asha, it's the fact that nothing about her was attractive, and nothing about her made me remotely think of Asha. Her bored lifelessness wasn't a turn on, her mannerisms are not appealing... I can't think of one thing about Yara that embodies the character of Asha. It's like she didn't do any character development or something. I personally think the actors should read the books to better understand their characters, and a lot of the actors have, but I don't think that's the case with the actress for Yara. It's not like I am the only one extremely disappointed here with Yara. Even the Wiki pictures of Asha look attractive(and I mean the real sort of attractive, not the everybody is beautiful in their own way bull shit).@lotunAsha as a name is a million times better than Yara. I agree with others that they could have given her the name Esgred or something, which is the name Asha gave Theon when she wanted to figure him out, before revealing who she was. Esgred would have still been better then Yara at least.

So in your country there are some totally universal standards of attractiveness and everyone adheres to them? I find this hard to believe.Anyway, I got it already. You don't find her attractive at all, good for you, taste is subjective and she's certainly no supermodel. But all your talk how you couldn't imagine anyone could find her attractive at all and how Alfie Allen is a hero for acting this way is quite annoying, to be frank.

It's personal opinion but most agree the actor fell flat in conveying Asha's spirit.

1348	Ghost714	2012-04-13	Again, everyone keeps pinging on the physical attractiveness of the actress chosen and that's NOT IT at all.

It's personal opinion but most agree the actor fell flat in conveying Asha's spirit.Exactly. I have said many times that's there is not just a problem with her physical looks. It is the lack of everything that makes Asha who she is. The charisma, the confidence, the passion for who she is, etc...Yara doesn't embody any of it. So thank you for your post, in seeing that i am not just saying she doesn't work because she isn't "hot". Because its not just Asha's physical appearance that makes her so appealing.
1349	howland_reed	2012-04-13	Anyway, I got it already. You don't find her attractive at all, good for you, taste is subjective and she's certainly no supermodel. But all your talk how you couldn't imagine anyone could find her attractive at all and how Alfie Allen is a hero for acting this way is quite annoying, to be frank.I understand taste is subjective, but just cause we don't find Yara attractive, does not mean we expected a "supermodel" to have been cast for Asha.No, I did not expect or imagine Asha to look like Kate Upton or Megan Fox or Alessandra Ambrosia, even while reading the books.  These women are stunning beauties, near perfect 10's, and hell, not even Lena Headey or Emilia Clarke compare to them.  But Headey and Clarke are still beautiful women in their own right.But if you're telling me there's no actress whose looks are inbetween those models and Gemma Whelan:http://29.media.tumb...44hcvo1_500.gifhttp://www.accesshol...ader_165610.jpgThen you need only look outside and see plenty of better looking women in the real world, not just in Hollywood.I understand that people may feel chastising her looks is exacerbating society's issue of placing a really high standard of beauty for women.  At the same time, I feel like Whelan's looks detract from the Asha we're presented in the books.  Instead of seeing her confidence and swagger as likable and attractive, she comes across to me as a bully.  I'll give her more time than one episode to win me over, but initial impressions for me are not good.
1350	teemo	2012-04-13	I think everyone needs to calm down and give her another episode or two.  Remember, most of her dialogue is when she was pretending to be Esgred.  And honestly, this focus about her physical attractiveness when she wasn't even very attractive in the books is making me a little sick.  If this was Loras who didn't live up to the "physical beauty" of the books there wouldn't be all of this hate.  I agree that she seemed to lack a little fire, but let's just give it a little more time.
1351	David Selig	2012-04-13	I feel we are talking past each other. I never said people were expecting a supermodel or that "there's no actress whose looks are inbetween those models and Gemma Whelan".I said I can certainly understand why people don't find her attractive at all, I just disagree personally. Physical attractiveness is a really small part of Asha's persona in the books anyway. And all this talk about lack of swagger and charisma after she had  4-5 minutes screen time is really premature.
1352	Travy1991	2012-04-13	Is that quote supposed to support your argument?  Cause Gemma Whelan does not fit a single description of that Asha.I'll reserve further judgment cause Mark Addy didn't fit the description of King Robert, nor did Michelle Fairley for Catelyn Tully (although that was just mainly aging her up), but both actors have been phenomenal in their role.  Perhaps Whelan can do the same.This is my problem with some of the fans of the series. There appears to be lots of sexism. Catelyn in the books is described as beautiful and regal looking with auburn hair and blue eyes. In my opinion, Michelle Fairley is quite attractive for a woman in her late 40s yet when she was initially cast, many fans whined and whined about ageing Catelyn up. It's funny that these fans didn't care about them ageing up Ned. In fact, Michelle Fairley pretty much resembles the Catelyn of the books while Sean Bean did not have Ned's long face or grey eyes. (By the way I'm not knocking Sean Bean as Ned, just saying he doesn't match physically).Gemma Whelan is not going to be everyone's idea of attractive and her performance isn't going to sway everyone. She's by no means a supermodel but is reasonably attractive and looks quite like the other actors cast as Greyjoys. I do understand where people are coming from with how she plays Asha a bit sullen but to me, Whelan manages to convey a relaxed, dryly humourous and tough woman who shows a lot of promise for Asha. I think one episode is far too early to make up your mind just yet.The main problem I have with this thread is how a bunch of superficial people are knocking down a slightly plain actress and acting as though she is one of the most hideous looking human beings in the world.
1353	WetHair	2012-04-13	I too am disappointed with Asha but I don't fault Gemma Whelan.  I think GOT put a huge amount of effort into casting and even though I am totally unfamiliar with her, I'm sure she is a very fine actress or she wouldn't have been hired.  I think she gave them the Asha they asked for and rather than criticizing Gemma the criticism may better be directed to the powers that be.
Speaking of her looks though, what is funny is that in the picture that was posted of her when she was cast she had short, dark hair.  I thought to myself oh, she is lucky, she won't have to wear a wig like everyone else.  I'm puzzled as to why they gave her longish, blond hair instead.  Maybe the thought was that since everyone else has to suffer it's only fair that she must suffer as well. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
1354	howland_reed	2012-04-13	The main problem I have with this thread is how a bunch of superficial people are knocking down a slightly plain actress and acting as though she is one of the most hideous looking human beings in the world.And around and around we go.  Why keep arguing the extremes?  Some of us find her unattractive.  That doesn't mean she's the most hideous person in the world (or even on the show), nor does it mean we were expecting a model to play her.I'm done belaboring this point.  Let's just leave it at some people find Yara attractive and others don't.  I still don't like how this Yara is being portrayed/characterized, but that is likely more the fault of the showrunners/director than it is the actress herself.

1355	Free Northman	2012-04-13	On a related note - as I don't see a Balon thread here - isn't Balon just the most awesomely adapted character bar none?
I thought Balon was utterly scary looking, exactly like I imagined him to look in the books. The sense of menace, ferocity and pent up hatred that he exuded was just off the scale.
I wish this actor was rather chosen for a more prominent character, like Stannis or someone. He is perfect for the Ice and Fire world.

He is perfect for the Ice and Fire world.I liked his scene a lot, and the way Theon seemed more and more like a little boy while he calmly tears him down was very well done. It really gave a sense of how hard and authoritative that character is.
1357	Envie	2012-04-14	I always felt sorry for Theon (well up until his Winterfell invasion anyways) because his story is such a tragedy from beginning to end. He really didn't have a choice in matters and his Father didn't try to keep in touch with him once he was taken hostage with the Starks. I imagine him feeling very much a 'little boy' as Balon tears him down and its kindof sad honestly.  I think he really did want to do the right thing by Robb Stark, but once he started trying to please a Father who no longer wanted him after returning to Pyke, everything seemed to start falling apart for Theon.
I also really love the actor they got for Balon. Spot on portrayal.
1358	teemo	2012-04-14	I also really love the actor they got for Balon. Spot on portrayal.So spot-on that it's eerie...I swear that's exactly how I've imagined him forever.
1359	Fredwin	2012-04-14	So spot-on that it's eerie...I swear that's exactly how I've imagined him forever.He's pretty damn convincing. I got to say, the one character I feel weird about is not Asha, but Melisandre. I can't quite put a finger on what it is though. She's certainly attractive and has a mystique to her(apparently super important for the female characters). Something is not jiving with how I imagined her though.

Awesome - it makes up for the ridiculous Ros+LF screentime.
1363	Milcov	2012-04-14	OMG someone finds the actress attractive....someone tell Ghost714!!!Think they were on about Mel not Asha. But the actress is fine it's the name that bothers me.
1364	House Balstroko	2012-04-14	The change from Asha to Yara was unecessary, but I like the portrayal of the character in the show. She looks cute, with a hint of fierceness and great pride.
1365	DaBillmann	2012-04-15	Someone else already said this, but I want to add my two cents. Unfortunately, "Yarra's" scenes were cut so much shorter on the show than they were in the book, it was hard to get ANY idea of her personality. This is not a case of bad acting, or evenbad writing, it is a case of underusing the character. let's give her a chance people.
as far as changeing the name, on the surface, it seems stupid to change  the name to avoid confusion. But, I also must say, that in a series liek this, with SO many characters, it can be easy to confuse characters. I remember when I readthe Lord of the Rings,  at one point Frodo says soemthing to Faramir, and I was thinking "Wait, Frodod is not with the Riders of Rohan!", for soem reason, I kept confusing Faramir anbd Eomar. AND there were points when I woudl confuse Asha with Doran Martell's daughter (can't think of her namne right now). I woudlbe talking to my friend about the Martell girl and refer to her as "Asha". Not trying to justify the name change, just saying, even when yo uare carefully reading/watching the series, yo ucna get soem characters confused.
1366	HyacinthGirl	2012-04-15	I think the changes depend so heavily on personal feeling towards the characters, for us readers. I've been very lucky because all of my favourites (Ned, Arya, Tyrion, Jon, Jaime, Davos) are portrayed perfectly, for me. (Some characters have even come across better for me on screen. Dany, for one. And Joffreys' better in the show than the books, IMO). And maybe if I was a massive Asha fan, it would really bother me that her name was changed, but... it doesn't, not really. Yeah, it's a little irritating, but... meh. And of course, there are those shallow people bitching bout her not being hot enough. I've noticed that with fantasy, people tend to go to extremes with their imagination, but Asha is never described as being EXTREMELY HOT. Some readers must have thought "huh, daughter of a King AND fights in battles... I'm going to picture a super-hot girl in a metal bikini!" Seriously, where is it written that Asha is a mega-hot warrior princess? She's just an attractive girl, fierce, tough and capable. As far as I'm concerned, that's exactly how Yara came across in last week's episode.Although when she appeared, not looking like a porn star in armour, I did worry about all the bashing she'd get. I was not wrong.

Some say she doesn't look athletic enough, but to be honest how 'athletic' should she look? Do you want Sarena Williams fit or Anna Kournikova fit? From meeting female sailors in the US Navy, she looks like someone who would be walking off a gangplank of a ship. To me, that's accurate for a seafarer. I am dissapointed that I didn't get the dinner scene from the book where she's seated over Theon, out drinks him and shows off her husband (axe) and suckling babe (dagger). I would pay real money to see that.As far as the fan art displayed above, that's exactly that: a fan's depiction of what Asha Greyjoy looks like. If I was to peal open a grafic novel version of ACoK, I would go with the third on the bottom row. But for film, how many actors, or women, look like any of those pictures?If people would like to see what a model looks like when you cast them as a warrior and how rediculous they look, check out the Olga Kurylenko in Centurion. She's supposed to be a badass warrior woman... but she looks like she weighs four pounds, half of that in her hair.Sofar, Gemma Whelan's okay in the role. The only thing she's missing is a couple of throwing axes and a scene with her playing the finger game.
1372	Marjie Eilie Myatt	2012-04-22	Sometimes I think HBO makes minor changes in order to assert their copyright(s) and trademarks.  The Stark sigil is described as a running direwolf when it's on a banner, not a head as illustrated in the TV series.  Jamie and Joffrey should have long golden curls; Renly also should have long hair.  Ned's hair should be darker--more like Jon Snow.  Jorah should be dark brunette and have a hairy body.  Some minor characters from the books have been turned into composites.  Then Asha becomes Yara (horrible), plus she and Theon were cast more fair than as described in the books.  The whole shaving-of-Renly's-chest-hair scene was stupid, and Loras doesn't look strong enough to fight off Brienne for even so much as a minute.  Have you seen this actor's arms?  Stereotyped homosexual.
All the children are aged up a couple of years, so it's not so gross to be thinking of their "flowering" and what-not (don't know why HBO couldn't keep that term) and so modern audiences can take them more seriously as commanders.  (And older actors are more capable and probably they're cleared for adult subject matter.)  But I can't picture Natalie Dormer having playdates with Tommen!  She's too old, and  HBO has given up Margaery's cunning too soon.
Some of the males I probably couldn't have taken seriously with the longer hair (remember Kevin Costner in Robin Hood; terrible).  But as for Asha, I didn't need her to be pretty (she's not described as pretty, nor buxom) but I needed someone with a lanky physicality and charisma with a mannish haircut.  The accuracy of the nose is not required; too difficult to cast.
But a more accurate nose should have been done on Rorge.  His didn't appear to be chopped off; did I not get a good look?
I did expect Shae to be stupider.  Not sure what's going on there.

Not sure what's going on there.Maybe we need a viewers guide  around here!For the 100th time ... on character ages... this show was not going to be shot in some third world country...so... film/tv production labor laws in developed countries prevent the hiring of actors under a certain age who are going to be on an adult show. In fact the number of hours they can work is also limited. Maybe this forum is going to have to present this fact a 1000 times before readers get through their heads that the actors in the show can not be the same age as the characters in the book, or the producers would have been arrested the first day. The age thing , everybody: get over it!{From my perspective I wish George had of dropped part of his 'European Middle Ages' template from the get go, he had in mind the series might make it to the visual media and he worked in the biz and knew the restrictions.}As far as any character's physical appearance , the producers not only have to hire the best actors they can, who approximate the prose characters, but a once production and costume design take shape a certain visual aesthetic takes hold that dictates a consistent presentation.  I don't think HBO's trademark inclination had anything to do with it, even if it had been a running dire-wolf HBO would have still owned the design as a trademark. Anyway I like the sigils D&D have approved better than artist concept I seen before the show. The House Targaryen one is the best of any I have seen anywhere.Relax and enjoy the show on it's own terms , I am sure you can hold two fun concepts in your mind at the same time.

1374	Marjie Eilie Myatt	2012-04-22	No need to be so defensive on behalf of HBO, as if they are immune from critique.  I have a good friend who works at HBO Entertainment myself; I am a fan.  I also am FULLY aware of the working restrictions on child actors, being a broadcast industry employee myself, who's under-age nephew also works in the industry, and who nonetheless sees PLENTY of children cast in children's roles.  They make it work when it's necessary, is what I'm saying, but it's not necessary nor even desirable for modern movie audiences to have to try to buy into the ages portrayed in Martin's books.  I don't want them younger; I personally have nothing to "get over" (except for Margaery being played by Natalie Dormer, I admit it; and the characterization is so different that therefore Margaery's awareness doesn't sneak up on the audience, as it does in the books).
I also teach trademark and copyright law, so I've been thinking about the design elements for a while.  I'm not saying that's the sole basis for design.  Artists can't function that way.  But I knew a guy who drew "Captain Jack Sparrow" for Disney comic books and coloring books, and he had to make the character NOT look like Johnny-Depp-as-Jack-Sparrow so that Disney wouldn't be paying Depp forever for appropriating his identity.

1378	LordofWinter	2012-04-26	.....isn't her full name ashara? which could be short formed to either asha or yara? i could be completely wrong
1379	mcbelfast	2012-05-01	I think the girl playing Yara/Asha is excellent but she's nothing like the character as described in the book. Asha is both dark haired and incredibly sexy.
1380	Acetabularia	2012-05-06	.....isn't her full name ashara? which could be short formed to either asha or yara? i could be completely wrongThat is actually a very good point, I never thought of that, and that is probably also true. The thing that bothers me with the name change is that Osha annoys Theon when he takes Winterfell and one of his thoughts is exactely that she reminds him of his sister and that even their names sound similar. That just bothers me.As to her appearance, it doesn't bother me that much. I suppose they could've dyied her hair a bit darker and cut it a little shorter.
1381	Lady_D	2012-05-19	I think Asha was described prettier in the books than Yara now turned out in the series. I don't mean that disrespectfully to the actress portraying her, I guess it is a question of make up and costume, and I actually think it works better. For her to command men at sea and in battle and have their respect, she needs to be tough and hardened rather than pretty. A woman who appears too attractive might have difficulties to convincingly play the part of a warrior woman in a male-dominated society such as Westeros. That doesn't mean attractive women could not play a tough fighter or leader, but with Emilia's Daenerys already falling into the warrior-queen category, audiences might find it hard to accept two beautiful amazon characters on one show, not to forget Arya, who, were she older, would make it three. As far as Asha/Yara is concerned, it will depend on the following episodes.your post makes me sad. god forbid we should have a tv show where there's more than one strong beautiful amazon woman. (sarcasm)'yara' is plain and uninspiring. i'm scared about what they're going to do to arianne and the sandsnakes.
1382	SkaagosChef	2012-06-04	I'm looking forward to the scene from ADWD when Theon finally meets Asha / Yara and says "You have to know your name"
1383	Gwendolyn	2012-06-13	Reading through it, I have to tell one thing, I found out was a funny thing at last, I was watching the second season before we got them on German TV translated for us and was wondering when I somewhere read about the differences between the book's and the TV Series, and did read about the name Asha got be named Yara, here comes the funny thing, finally we got her on TV past week and in Germany they named her back to Asha so I was confused after reading the differences between book and TV Series  but that could really confuse you, if you are watching the series in original, then in translation and reading the books, if one name changes and then changes back, it's not we don't have enough names to deal with /shocked.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':shocked:' />
1384	Khal Porno	2012-07-21	Yara = Asha. The producers of the show just take watchers for utter idiots and thus think they might confuse Asha and Osha.I think it has more to do with making sure the call sheets aren't confusing.  They have enough going on keeping all the plates spinning to worry about confusing what cast member was supposed to be where because of a typo.
1385	Jolene Brown	2012-07-22	For me, what I don't understand about this, even still months later, is why would you change the name of a major character because an incredibly minor's characters name is so close?  I understand why they wanted to change one of the names, but it seems so obvious that they should change OSHA's name, not Asha's.  This is what drives me berserk.

I understand why they wanted to change one of the names, but it seems so obvious that they should change OSHA's name, not Asha's.  This is what drives me berserk.See my last post.  I'm sure they didn't think about the problem until after they'd already been writing/shooting season one with Osha in it.  Also, people would have been just as upset if Osha appeared onscreen with a different name when the first season aired.
1387	Jolene Brown	2012-07-22	If tSee my last post.  I'm sure they didn't think about the problem until after they'd already been writing/shooting season one with Osha in it.  Also, people would have been just as upset if Osha appeared onscreen with a different name when the first season aired.If that's true, that's just silly - I would think they know the series better than that.  And I definitely don't agree that people would be just as upset if Osha had a different name.  Would some people complain?  Sure.  Some people will complain about anything.  But there is a huge difference in the importance of the characters.  And it's especially silly since Osha's name is hardly ever used, while Asha's name is used all the time.  Agh, it drives me nuts.  I know it's a sort of silly comparison, given that fantasy, however popular, still doesn't really get "respect" from a lot of the cultural gatekeepers, but would you make a Shakespeare play and change one of the characters' names?  No!  Ophelia stays Ophelia, Rosalind stays Rosalind, and so forth.  Names are important!
1388	David Selig	2012-07-22	For me, what I don't understand about this, even still months later, is why would you change the name of a major character because an incredibly minor's characters name is so close?  I understand why they wanted to change one of the names, but it seems so obvious that they should change OSHA's name, not Asha's.  This is what drives me berserk. So far Osha's had about 5 times more screen time. Both GRRM and the showrunners apparently really like Osha's actress, so she might wellcontinue to get more screentime or at least comparable to Asha/Yara.
1389	Khal Porno	2012-07-22	And I'm sure she's probably going to be a much more important character once Rickon comes back into the books.
1390	Envie	2012-04-09	A lot of people in the initial thoughts thread, like me, thought the scene with Ros and Littlefinger was unnecessary and wasted time in the episode that could have gone to other more worthy story lines.Apparently the producers felt it was necessary to better flesh out just how 'sinister' Peter can be based on their interview here:Inside the Episode:  http://www.youtube.c...ture=plpp_videoAfter watching this narrative of several of the scenes, I better understand the reasoning for the crying Ros scene, but I'm not entirely convinced it was still that necessary. Everyone by now knows how despicable Littlefinger is and how dangerous he can be. Those who haven't read the books undoubtedly believe him to be fairly slimy and immoral even if they don't know yet what's to come with Sansa and the Eyrie, etc. Perhaps the producers are wrangling with how to chisel down all the political info that was in book 2 and make it easier to digest for television viewers. Dumbing it down would require a lot more exposition and scene manipulating I suppose. Maybe since they added that scene last week with Cersei's play on Littlefinger (which made him look weak), they felt it necessary to add a scene this week to show just how powerful he is, if only behind the scenes in secret.Yes, as D&D stated, at the base of Littlefinger's suave well groomed appearance and carefully controlled speech is a pimp. He's still just a pimp trying to turn a buck at the expense of human lives.
1391	Tyrion-kratS	2012-04-09	complete waste of time. little finger's despicable nature will be borne out by his despicable (is he really that bad?) deeds. 
I guess most of us are coming from a position of having read the books, and we know that Ros isn't a real character, and so we struggle to figure out why she would be in the show at all, thats certainly my feelings. I think the only reason she is there is so that we have a plausible route into a (any) brothel, which will become more important later on. 
but as a reader, I dont like it, not when we could be at the wall or on the kings road.
1392	Arrogant Bastard	2012-04-09	I pretty much agree with you, despite thinking it was a pretty good scene. Littlefinger's already been established as a shit weasel, so the scene wasn't really necessary and I feel like the time could have been better utilized with Theon and Yara, whose horse ride was cut pretty short. Still, it wasn't a bad scene and it was miles better than the Littlefinger Ros scene last season, so it really didn't bother me that much. I enjoyed it more than the Theon Captain's daughter scene, which really should have been cut despite being in the book.
1393	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-09	I've been a supporter of Ros' inclusion on the show.  Last season her character gave viewers intimate knowledge of certain characters in the easiest and visually pleasing way possible.  Book readers know Theon confusion with his identity leads him down horrible paths and book readers know that Littlefinger is a manipulative, slimy pimp but viewers don't know this.  Hence the need for a Ros.
However, I find myself baffled by her inclusions in this season thus far.  At first I thought she'd take the place of Chataya or Alayaya but since Tyrion brought Shae to the Tower of the Hand, there's no need for Chataya's brothel or tunnel.  The only other thing we got from Chataya and her tunnels is the knowledge that Tywin created them but we got that same sort of information in this episode from Varys when he casually mentioned that Tyrion found Shae in Tywin's 'kitchens'. Then when Ros was instructing the whore, I thought maybe she would be the one to instruct a fake Arya (should they include that storyline) since she's the only person in King's Landing that knows Winterfell apart from Sansa. 
The crying scene left me even more confused about her purpose.  We have already been shown that Littlefinger is slimy, manipulative, sneaky, and not afraid to hurt people.  Last season we saw him betray Ned and Catelyn, we saw him make Sansa uncomfortable, we saw him threaten violence to Ned, we saw him treat his whores like slaves and objects, we saw him basically start a war with false information, we saw him get one over on Varys.  We learned very well that Littlefinger is all about Littlefinger and he will get his way without any consideration of honor.  Why do we need to have it beaten into our heads again?  We didn't learn anything new about Littlefinger (unless the man he was talking about was Qyburn). 
I liked the scene but I grow weary of seeing Littlefinger and Ros so much.  It seems as if he's had more scenes than any other character on the show.  I want to learn something new about other show characters or spend more time on some of the main characters.
1394	Greywolf2375	2012-04-09	but as a reader, I dont like it, not when we could be at the wall or on the kings road.or using any of a multitude of characters from the books instead of inventing one to shoe horn in.
1395	teemo	2012-04-09	I think Ros is a very annoying and uncreative plot device to flesh out Littlefinger, and pretty much the only one we have.  It seems like lazy writing to me.  Like someone else said (well, similar) in another thread, TV LF looks just more like a creepy douchebag than book LF, who is a big time game-playing creep.
1396	Ramsay Gimp	2012-04-09	It was very creepy. I don't think it was redundant like some other posters. Yes, the show has established that Baelish is slick and an amoral opportunist, but this scene made him seem truly evil for the first time in the series. He was actually scary, which may be different than the books but it is leagues better than making him stupid like last episode
1397	Envie	2012-04-09	The crying scene left me even more confused about her purpose.  We have already been shown that Littlefinger is slimy, manipulative, sneaky, and not afraid to hurt people.  Last season we saw him betray Ned and Catelyn, we saw him make Sansa uncomfortable, we saw him threaten violence to Ned, we saw him treat his whores like slaves and objects, we saw him basically start a war with false information, we saw him get one over on Varys.  We learned very well that Littlefinger is all about Littlefinger and he will get his way without any consideration of honor.  Why do we need to have it beaten into our heads again?  We didn't learn anything new about Littlefinger (unless the man he was talking about was Qyburn).Yes, exactly - all that has been established well enough from season one. Why exactly did the producers feel the need to establish, yet again this season just how 'dangerous' Littlefinger is in the game? They seem to be bashing viewers over the head with it. Come on guys, your viewers are not idiots. Even if they haven't read the books, they get it by now!Honestly, I always felt Varys was a far more dangerous and creepy character from the books, but he's almost likable in many of his scenes on the show. It's almost as if they're trying to have the two outdo each other more than they already did with their throne room verbal sparring matches.I too was a supporter of Ros's usefulness as a storytelling tool in the first season. Through her whore scenes we learn quite a bit that couldn't be explained on screen from the books about Theon (and the Starks), Tyrion, Littlefinger and Pycelle. All were useful scenes.This season? Not so much. Ros isn't important and didn't even exist, why do they persist on giving her these entirely too long exaggerated scenes?
1398	Lord Varys	2012-04-09	The scene does not make sense. It's useless and pointless, and it actually distorts Littlefinger's character. The man might be cruel, but I'm not sure he'd treat his trusted confidants/lieutenants this way (and Ros is, after all, now the overseer of this brothel). Littlefinger is more dependent than anyone else besides Varys and Illyrio on people he can fully trust. Among them would be Lothor Brune and Oswell Kettleblack. Ros should be somewhat on that level by now.
As the series portrays him, Littlefinger seems to be pimp first, Minister of Finance second, but that's not the case. Brothels are an investment to Littlefinger, not individual whores. He would not care about, nor oversee his brothels personally. He would not spend that much time there because he has to run a ministry, and plot the downfall of other people.
People of note don't want to be acquainted to a pimp. The way they portray it, I don't see Littlefinger's talent of 'befriending powerful men, and women'.
Lastly, I don't think that our Petyr is that cruel/sinister in day-to-day private life. He does not appear to be a nice guy. He is a nice guy who stabs you in the back but he does it still with a funny line and a smile. But even if he were, he would hire some pimp to keep his girls in line. He would not dirty his hands personally to threaten the likes of Ros.
They do the right thing with Varys, so why must Littlefinger be this stupid pimp?
1399	Morrigan	2012-04-09	Useless filler, and a distortion of Littlefinger. Yeah, we already know he's greedy and cruel, but this was just mustache-twirling stupidity. D&D have made Littlefinger and Ros their pet fanfiction (see: http://tvtropes.org/...Main/TheScrappy and http://tvtropes.org/...ain/CreatorsPet) and it needs to die and it needs to die. Fast.

1400	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-04-09	Petyr had mentioned that he catered to all manner of perversions last season, with Ros he hinted at one of those perversions are.  Might be the whore he spoke of was sold to a certain Northern bastard...
1401	Sci-2	2012-04-09	I liked the scene. We see more of the anger and narcissism of LFinger that is kept from us, so far, in the books.
But then I like Ros as a character overall and am curious to see how she'll fit into the altered story.
1402	Tadco26	2012-04-09	I thought this scene was the most likely made up scene that fits the book Littlefinger.  I think the scene was actually pretty well done, and I have hated Ros' other scenes.  That being said I agree that there is so much content that has to be cut short that this screen time could have been spent else where.  I suspect they have to give Aiden x number of scenes to keep him as an actor, and at least this one seemed to fit the book Littlefinger when most have not.  I always compare the book version to Ben Linus on Lost who initially comes across as non-threatening, or Verbal Kint in the Usual Suspects who we only find out much later is Keyser SA¶ze.  I think much of the revelations of what he tells Sansa at the end of Storm of Swords and beyond will be reduced with all these blatant "insights".  The thing is Littlefinger is not a point of view character so don't really need all these extra insights to give exactly the same amount of info as book readers have and all the created background removes the mystery that makes him more interesting in the future.
1403	Catastrophe	2012-04-09	I agree with Lord Varys, this was a pointless scene. Littlefinger started a war that will result in tens of thousands of deaths, solely for the sake of power. On a more personal level, he's the one who betrayed Ned Stark and got him killed. It should be already pretty obvious that he's evil, we don't need to see him threatening a whore to hammer that point home.I also thought this incident was very out of character for him. He's not a Saturday morning cartoon villain. He's supposed to be affably evil, that's how he gets people to trust him. He'll kill people when it suits his purposes or advances his plans, but he's not cruel for the sake of being cruel. He's also not supposed to be a pimp in the books, he owns brothels but I never got the impression that he ran them himself. Threatening Ros just seems so beneath him.Also, his story about the Lysene pleasure girl doesn't make sense to me. I know that most whores in Westeros are treated horribly, but they're still not slaves! It's a major plot point that slavery is illegal in Westeros, the idea of whores being bought and sold like chattel doesn't fit.
1404	Catastrophe	2012-04-09	Oh, and while it's not really a big deal, I thought the scene where Littlefinger wipes some "fluids" off the whore's mouth was disgusting. I hate to sound like a prude, but I do NOT want to see that level of sexual content on Game of Thrones. HBO went too far with that one.
1405	teemo	2012-04-09	I agree with Lord Varys, this was a pointless scene. Littlefinger started a war that will result in tens of thousands of deaths, solely for the sake of power.

One of the first things that popped into my head when I saw this scene was, "Does LF really deal with such trivial matter such as this?  And since when does he act so cartoonish evil towards people?"  I just tried to shrug it off as Ros being some super important whore manager of one of his richest brothels, but it really just wasn't a very good LF scene...again....

1406	Catastrophe	2012-04-09	That's actually another plot hole: If Ros is now the manager of Littlefinger's most upscale brothel, why is she still servicing clients herself? I've never heard of a "madame" who worked as a whore in her own establishment, it's ridiculous. Then again, I always thought Ros was an extremely superfluous character, so I guess I shouldn't be too surprised. /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />
I think a big part of the problem with Littlefinger's scenes this season is that he didn't actually do a lot in the second book. It wasn't until the third book that we really got to see the extent of his political maneuvering, but since the TV show writers don't want to ignore a major character for two full years, they keep adding in stuff for him to do that just doesn't quite fit.

I've never heard of a "madame" who worked as a whore in her own establishment, it's ridiculous.Yeah, you're right.  She wouldn't be doing both.  And I just can't imagine LF spending his days in his brothels scaring the whores, lol.  For one thing, too trivial for him, and another - if he DID spend his days doing that (micro-managing his brothels), he would probably actually be nice or something - try to genuinely cheer her up.
1408	mrkorb	2012-04-09	I found myself wondering what the point of this scene was after I watched it.  On the surface of things, it felt like an unnecessary followup to the bastard slaughter montage from the previous episode.  Then I paid a little more attention to the things Baelish said.A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl.  To use her in ways thatnever occur to most men.  And you know what occurs to most men.Who do we know that has a lot of money?  What rather mysterious beautiful and smart girl was rather recently discovered in the war camp of somebody who has a lot of money?  I think this mystery whore that he was talking about is Shae, and she was bought by Tywin Lannister.  Let's not forget where Shae ends up.As for transforming her, we know Varys has his informers, and Baelish has his informers, and Cersei has hers, so why not Tywin?  His instruction to Tyrion that he not bring her to court, he has to know that Tyrion will rebel at that.  So now Shae is Tywin's person on the inside, maybe not as inside as he would like, but at the very least she's there when he isn't and might have a way to send him information on what Tyrion is up to.That, or HBO wanted a scene with some gratuitous jizz wiping.  Just a theory I came up with for what otherwise seemed to be a throwaway inserted scene with no basis in the books.
1409	congokong	2012-04-09	Everything with Ros is a waste of time. We know Petyr is evil. Was putting a dagger to Ned's throat not enough to convince the audience? They're forcing more screen time on Petyr than he deserves this season.
1410	Lord Varys	2012-04-09	There are tons of interesting things for Littlefinger to do besides talking to whores. They could give us another scene with him and Varys, discussing Tyrion, Joffrey, Cersei, and the war. They could expand on Littlefinger's thoughts on Tyrion and the whole dagger thing. This will be a theme in the next episode, I know, but people might have forgotten that Littlefinger was responsible for Tyrion's troubles in season 1.
They could show us Littlefinger embezzling the Crown, selling offices in the treasury to the highest bidder. They could us give the first somewhat intimate Littlefinger-Sansa-scene. They even could us give a Littlefinger-Joffrey-scene. To give us a glimpse that Littlefinger has some influence over Joffrey. Showing us Ros shows us nothing.
1411	Sci-2	2012-04-09	Oh, and while it's not really a big deal, I thought the scene where Littlefinger wipes some "fluids" off the whore's mouth was disgusting. I hate to sound like a prude, but I do NOT want to see that level of sexual content on Game of Thrones. HBO went too far with that one.I thought this was incredibly unnecessary as well.

Showing us Ros shows us nothing.I have to disagree. I think this scene was incredibly vital to showing us the kind of man Littlefinger truly is. He doesn't simply make a living off women like some happy go lucky brothel owner, he exploits them and really doesn't give a shit past his bottom line. This gets to the heart of the man's character, and establishes for tv viewers just why his relationship with Sansa will be so dangerous for the girl. With HBO already running the risk of glamorising prostitution via the brothel sex scenes, I think this part was extremely useful in showing the seedy underbelly, and how men like LF make a profit whilst seliing these girls to the highest bidder.
1413	brashcandy	2012-04-09	Yeah, you're right.  She wouldn't be doing both.  And I just can't imagine LF spending his days in his brothels scaring the whores, lol.  For one thing, too trivial for him, and another - if he DID spend his days doing that (micro-managing his brothels), he would probably actually be nice or something - try to genuinely cheer her up.
	Spoiler  Is this the same LF who takes Jeyne Poole to be "trained" in one of his brothels, then hands her over to the Lannisters to be sent to Ramsay Bolton, looks at Sansa in a way that makes the girl feel like she has no clothes on, and later on pushes his wife through a moon door? 
 LF doesn't "cheer" women up, and he certainly wouldn't bother doing so with a prostitute. I think the scene was spot on. The man is a predator and extremely creepy. This scene doesn't necessarily show him micro-managing his business, he's just being a smart investor and checking on his "property" after the baby killing incident. I think it's exactly the kind of thing LF would say to a prostitute. Coming off at first as nice and caring, and then revealing that callous, sinister side.

1414	Keep Shelly in Athens	2012-04-10	Just a monetary investment is the explicit way to read it. However, the implicit reading established how he needs "happy" whores to do their work so he can do his work spying on patrons to get knowledge (it's power, remember?) of pertinent information from their sexposition. Also, the "sincerity of prostitutes" is a theme from the books, so I didn't see it as a complete waste of time (although it would be lost on new viewers). ETA: there was also a nice parallel between Varys/Littlefinger who were both making threats to hired women in this ep.

1415	Honey Badger	2012-04-10	Ros as exposition with Littlefinger got fairly heavy handed last season, especially with the two women touching each other while LF pontificated about the realm.  I do like this scene though.  Goes to show that his exclusivity agreement with Ros is really an arrangement with property, and Ros is locked in.  If she tries to leave, I expect LF will kindly slit her throat for her.  I think some of you guys forget how easy it is to kill someone inside the city walls.  Slavery being banned in Westeros doesn't mean much.
Ros having some compassion for the children gives her a little more complexity.  Overall, other than Esme Bianco being incredibly hot, I hope she eventually crosses LF and he shows her it was a big mistake coming to King's Landing.
1416	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-10	Who do we know that has a lot of money?  What rather mysterious beautiful and smart girl was rather recently discovered in the war camp of somebody who has a lot of money?  I think this mystery whore that he was talking about is Shae, and she was bought by Tywin Lannister.  Let's not forget where Shae ends up.As for transforming her, we know Varys has his informers, and Baelish has his informers, and Cersei has hers, so why not Tywin?  His instruction to Tyrion that he not bring her to court, he has to know that Tyrion will rebel at that.  So now Shae is Tywin's person on the inside, maybe not as inside as he would like, but at the very least she's there when he isn't and might have a way to send him information on what Tyrion is up to.I think you have a pretty valid theory.  We know from the books that Tywin is the one who probably created the tunnels to Chataya's brothel.  In the show, Bronn said he took the girl from some guys tent but never says who.  But then Varys tells Tyrion that Shae says she was 'working in Tywin's kitchens'.  We know in the books that Shae must have had some sort of relationship with Tywin because she was in his bed.  Last season we saw Shae get very upset when prodded about her past. Your theory on who the mystery whore is holds up pretty well with all of this information.
1417	Mrs.Stark	2012-04-10	I don't feel like that scene was necessary at all. I think it's  been pretty evident what type of character LF is throughout the show, even if you haven't read the books. My husband has not read the books and during the scene with LF and Cersei he blurted out "Oh, huge mistake!" He pretty much figures LF is going to come back with a vengeance and prove his point about where the power really lies. I don't think the scene with Ros really added all that much because most of the audience has a fair idea of how devious LF is, even if they haven't seen all he can do yet. Having said that, I'm not outraged by the scene either. It was an ok moment but nothing special.
1418	Davos55	2012-04-10	Dr. Pepper and mrkorb: I also definitely got a vibe that the story he was telling had a greater purpose than just showing Little Finger's malicious side (which is well established so far). I like your theory about it being about Shae and Tywin, I think that is very interesting and it actually makes a lot of sense. The books don't go into why Shae was in Tywin's bed when she met her doom, and I figured the show would definitely flesh that out more. The scene from last season with Bronn, Tyrion and Shae playing the "lying game", definitely showed that she was hiding something and she got very defensive. I am curious to see where the show goes with the whole Tywin and Shae storyline!
As far as the scene itself, I believe it was a decent one overall, and it may have some implications later on. My theory is that after this, Ros will really want to please Little Finger, and she will become an efffective "little bird" for him. I don't believe D&D would put this much time into a non book character if she wasn't going to play a bigger role later that will have some more ramifications on the plot. Little Finger is one of my favorite characters in the novels for sure, and while the show version definitely deviates from my personal vision of him, he is still very intriguing, and I like to see any scene with him in it. I hope there will be more scenes with him and Sansa, him and Varys, and him and Joffrey one on one.
PS. I really hope the show starts to show more of Sandor Clegane. He is definitely one of my favorites in the novels, and he hasn't gotten nearly enough time on the series yet.
1419	Sound_of_winter	2012-04-10	I'm too lazy to read through the thread so i am sorry if this has been said a bunch of times: i found the whole whore house scene to be stupid, first off way too much sex following Theon's scene, wiping the girl's face was just /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' />  The viewers already know Little Finger is a crazy scheming little shit, so why show what an ass hat he is again? Although, someone did mention in another thread that it seemed like he was talking about Qyburn when he talked about a man buying a lyense whore.
1420	Elundin	2012-04-10	Ok, I felt the entire brothel scene was unnecessary. We already know he earns his living off whorehouses, we already know he's bad (though, I will disagree on that characterization, he is not bad). So, unless the producers felt some more naked skin was needed, I don't see any usefulness in it.
1421	Woman of War	2012-04-10	Actually I like the actress playing Ros, she is far better than she was allowed to show in the first season.
But then I want to see LF as sinister politician, and not only as devious and creepy. He is imo not the unpredictable sociopath like Joffrey, he is a calculating, clever and ruthless businessman. Though he has two weaknesses: his planned revenge on the High Lords and Ladies who looked down on him when he was still a decent boy and his infatuation with Sansa. The precise nature of that relationship has not yet been truly established in the books and I do not like it if in the show they try to characterize LF as ultimately evil before time, it takes out interesting ambiguity.

1422	gmoney88	2012-04-10	I didn't mind the idea in it of itself...I just hope this Ros story is actually serving a purpose.
Really though, the scene was ludicrously long. If you include the whole brothel sequence, it was like 10 minutes! its crazy for a show so pressed for time!
1423	Hear Us Roar	2012-04-10	I did not mind it
1424	The Meeraculous Third Reed	2012-04-10	It was a complete waste of time.
Littlefinger this season has allowed himself to talk himself into a humiliation by Cersei, and has pointlessly frightened the day-to-day administrator of one of his seemingly most important brothels. He is being dumbed-down for no real reason.
1425	Thaune	2012-04-10	I didn't like the scene, there were better ways of giving us more insight into LF's head.
That said, people here need to remember, this is Game of Thrones, the TV show.
Most viewers have no idea what's about to happen next, that Ros doesn't exist in the books, etc etc.
You have to view the show as a separate product.
I thought season 1 was dead on and stuck to the books 99% of the time, and these two episodes in season 2 much less so.
But it might be necessary as your average HBO viewer is not your average GoT reader, they need to attract both types.
1426	lacuna	2012-04-10	IDK... Felt out of character for me. Sure, LF is ruthless and conniving, but why make someone inside your organization a potential enemy, feeding them reasons to hate your guts, when you can make a "friend", all at the cost of a simple lie and a false show of compassion? He gave her the day off anyway.
Governing through fear should be Cersei's domain.
1427	redriver	2012-04-10	It was a repulsive scene ,with a palpable sense of evil about it.But I think that was by design,just as GRRM includes repulsive scenes in his books.
The only saving note was that Roz appears more human.
The Lysene whore and cutomer could be Illyrio and future wife.

1428	David Selig	2012-04-10	I didn't mind this scene, but I would certainly preferred to see LF working as master of Coin (something we don't get in the books and it could show how much he's embezzling (if any), how he increased the revenues of the crown so much) or pulling off some elaborate plot. This scene achieved its goal to show he's a ruthless bastard, but the same thing could've been done in a more interesting way, and it's not like many viewers had illusions about him after the way he used his supposed great love Catelyn in S1.

1429	Isis	2012-04-10	I didn't mind the idea in it of itself...I just hope this Ros story is actually serving a purpose.Really though, the scene was ludicrously long. If you include the whole brothel sequence, it was like 10 minutes! its crazy for a show so pressed for time!Agreed. I didn't hate it but I didn't think much of it either. And I don't find myself feeling any sympathy toward Ros because she sniffled a bit. How are we to know they were real tears anyway? We've not seen much compassion in her before, so I remain unconvinced/uncaring.So, yes, this scene is bearable if it has a greater purpose. Otherwise I am just bored of Ros and becoming irritated by the way LF is being portrayed in the show. Please can we see him do some more stuff outside of the brothels?
1430	Lord Varys	2012-04-10	Well, Littlefinger does not want to exploit Sansa in a sexual way. He does not intend to make her whore. He wants her to love him. The man is no pimp at heart, and he wants to seduce Sansa, not to rape her. Further, the whole 'Knowledge is power' is not Littlefinger's motto. Using this line with Littlefinger was the greatest mistake in last weeks scene with Cersei. Implying that he knows about the incest, and being somewhat reluctant to do the dirty work for Cersei, was insofar in character as Littlefinger saved Cersei's and Joffrey's ass during the whole Ned-crisis and might thus actually believe the guys in charge of KL should be thankful for that. But he would never try to blackmail them.
Littlefinger's motto is 'money is power'. Littlefinger does not threaten or blackmail people (just as Varys does not), he buys their allegiance, or he befriends them. That's how he works, and that's why he is so successful. Nobody considers him a real threat. He operates under everybody radar (excluding Varys, and now Tyrion). But as soon as somebody considers him a real threat he is lost. Littlefinger would never even use a line like 'It's hard for them to simper and bow without heads' during a private conversation with Varys. He would never admit to anyone what his true feelings are.
TV-Littlefinger is just a pimp who - for some occult reason - hangs out with the guys on the Small Council. Not sure why any of them should respect/interact/befriend a pimp. I'd not.
1431	Milcov	2012-04-10	It just doesn't make sense. I'd rather have more LF/Varys scenes than LF/Ros scenes, that shows what he's actually up to better. He owns brothels to make money, they aren't his whole life however.
1432	birdsong66	2012-04-10	For people who have read the book, this scene was completely pointless and frustrating because we would prefer not to waste valuable screen time beating the dead horse that LF is a sociopathic monster.
For viewers who have not ventured to read the series, this scene served to flesh out LF by way of Roz.
Both situations have merit, but for me, I would prefer less Roz altogether.  Completely superfluous inclusion where other characters already established would have served without need of suspension of disbelief on my part.  And, in a purely superficial sense, the actress is a bad crier---just couldn't buy it.  At.  All.
I do not share D&D's love for the character, or the actress.  In effect, I couldn't care less what happens to her.
YMMV, of course.
1433	brashcandy	2012-04-10	Well, Littlefinger does not want to exploit Sansa in a sexual way. He does not intend to make her whore. He wants her to love him. The man is no pimp at heart, and he wants to seduce Sansa, not to rape her.Huh? So because he chooses to play mind games, deceive and manipulate her it means that he's more honourable than your ordinary rapist? Sansa even compares him to Marillion in ASOS. What LF is doing to Sansa is the very definition of sexual exploitation. He has her under his control and is using that power to make her kiss him, sit on his lap, and god knows what else will be coming in TWOW. He is a pimp at heart. That's how he makes a lot of money and that's how he sees women - as objects to be used for his selfish desires.TV-Littlefinger is just a pimp who - for some occult reason - hangs out with the guys on the Small Council. Not sure why any of them should respect/interact/befriend a pimp. I'd not.I think the TV show will go on to do a good job of depicting LF's subtleties and the many layers to his character, but I can't fault them for wanting to show the kind of sinister person he can be via his interaction with women who have no power to fight back. It's absolutely crucial to understanding why he's so dangerous to Sansa later on. He's not simply a smart game player, he's a ruthless pimp.

1434	Lord Varys	2012-04-10	Well, my definition of pimp states that this is a guy who exploits whores and takes away the money they earn for his own benefit. Littlefinger does not command Sansa to have sex with other women. Thus he is not a pimp in his relationship with her. He may want to take her into his own bed eventually, but I very much doubt he intends to make her a prostitute.
Littlefinger's attraction to/obsession with Sansa has nothing to do with exploiting her in a sexual way (i.e. making her a whore). The man is no pedophile, he is not attracted to little girls. Sansa is (more beautiful) version of Catelyn to him. By making her his own, his daughter-wife, he will get the very thing he always wanted back when he was the youth who challenged Brandon Stark to single combat.
And Littlefinger does not make most of his money through brothels/whores. They are part of his investment policy, but the only thing that attracts him to whores is the fact that 'they seldom sink, and if they are boarded by pirates, they pay coin like everybody else'. But Littlefinger does own ships as well, he is an investor at heart, a speculator, a thief. They should show ruining merchants, selling offices, stealing lands from impoverished lords and such, not spying on the patrons of his brothel or threatening insignificant whores.
People who believe this is Littlefinger's character most likely also believe he personally whipped Jeyne Poole during her 'training'... This is ridiculous.

This is ridiculous.I'm sorry, but I'm not quite sure that you're being serious in this response. Sexual exploitation does not equate to making someone a whore. It means that you're using your power over someone to coerce them into giving sexual or otherwise "intimate" favours. The victim is unable to resist doing so because they fear the consequences of showing their displeasure. Littlefinger didn't need to whip Jeyne personally in order to be held responsible for what happened to the girl. And do you not see how  sick and perverted it is that he is trying to turn Sansa into this "daughter-wife " as you put it? As for not being attracted to little girls, here is what Sansa notes in AGOT:Sansa seated herself beside the queen. Cersei smiled again, but that did not make her feel any less anxious. Varys was wringing his soft hands together, Grand Master Pycelle kept his sleepy eyes on the papers in front of him, but she could feel Littlefinger staring. Something about the way the smalll man looked at her made Sansa feel as though she had no clothes on. Goosebumps pimpled her skin.

1436	Lord Varys	2012-04-10	We are not discussing sexual exploitation here, we are discussing Littlefinger. He is not a pimp in the books in the sense that he personally oversees, trains, and punishes prostitutes in his employ (or prostitutes working in brothels he owns). Of course he is taking advantage of Sansa and stuff, but she is a special case. As I see the character, this is not habit, meaning that Littlefinger does not treat all women in the same way as he treats Sansa...
1437	Lord Hodor	2012-04-10	I think that scene was a way to both show LF`s dispicableness and try and establish Qyburn`s existance.
I`ve read on this forum before that Vargo Hoat is not making an appearence on the show, and without The Goat where would Qyburn come from?
Without Qyburn there`d be no walk of shame, no Osney Kettleblack torture and double confession, etc et al.
LF just gave us the answer on the last episode. He`s his buddy! Which doubles down as making LF the worse human being ever.
1438	Milcov	2012-04-10	Wait, no Vargo Hoat? So what'll happen with Jaime's hand, surely they can't leave it on.
1439	Lord Hodor	2012-04-10	I`m not stating as fact, just repeating what I once read on this very forum. I`m sure they can arrange for his lost hand during his escape without The Goat.
Having said that, I do wish that Vargo shows and they keep things closer to the book, not holding my breath however.

He is a pimp in the books, and I don't know why you think that just because we saw him threatening Ros and visiting his whorehouse that it means HBO is trying to portray him as a micro-manager. Besides this, we know that punishment goes on in his brothels (via Jeyne), and the show didn't claim that LF would be personally overseeing this punishment. As he states, he gave the Lyseni whore over to someone else and didn't very much care what happened to her, but we can surmise it wasn't pleasant. His taking advantage of Sansa is not a special case. Look at how he treats Jeyne, Cat, and Lysa.

1441	Woman of War	2012-04-10	I think the series want to give Ros much more of a personality and finally she will replace Chataya and Alayaya. And it might be her who gets whipped because she is taken for Tyrion's woman. 
We are expected to feel for her and she might be built  up as contrast to Shae. Actually I like both actresses, Kekili as well as the Ros actress, and although they are not in the books the way they are or not even at all, they are not bad. But I miss Alayaya, the clever and curious prostitute who wants to learn. I would have liked more important commoner characters not only in the series but as well in the books.
1442	The Black Wolf	2012-04-10	I must say that, while I've actually enjoyed LF's scenes this season, I feel they are a bit out of character. Not as much as some here seem to think... but enough that I notice it and think there was something that wasn't quite right in the scene. I understand LF being in his brothels, I always assumed that these whores were more than a purely monetary investment, these brothels are probably a rather important source of information for him (like Doreah said: men like to talk when they are happy). What I don't understand is why he would openly threaten Ros like that if she is indeed the overseer of this brothel, just like I don't think he would ever openly have threatened Cersei like he did in the first episode. Basically all of LF's schemes are based on people seeing him as a friend or dismissing him as a threat! Oh, well, I'll wait for a few more episodes to make my final judgement... I still love Aidan Gillen as Littlefinger, though...
1443	Purah	2012-04-10	I found it totally unnecessary and whilst yes, Ros did gain some personality, I still can't help but feel that she's just some bland fan service and the creator's pet character. As for Littlefinger, well he was one step away from declaring that he does it because "its eeeeeeeeeevil", that's how Saturday-morningish it felt. 
I do hope they develop Littlefinger's character without Ros, hopefully his scenes with the Tyrells will redeem this ugly, cartoonish villainy. I personally found his scenes with Varys in Season 1 really quite delightful and full of chemistry, and wish there was more of Book LF's personality on show.
Book LF was everyone's friend and no one's enemy, full of cheery smiles and clever jokes, even when setting Westeros on fire and watching it burn, all in the name of love. I just found this aspect of him downright chilling (admittedly though, I do end up channelling Johan from Naoki Urasawa's Monster whenever I read about Littlefinger, so it may be just me). The subtle sociopathy, the "friend" who put a lot of effort into earning your friendship only to stab you in the back...that, I think will prove to be so much more effective, than what D&D are writing atm.
1444	Envie	2012-04-10	We are not discussing sexual exploitation here, we are discussing Littlefinger.

Littlefinger wasn't painted as a sexual predator or using sexual exploitation as part of his retinue of weapons in the game. Now granted he does start doing some creepy insinuations with his 'daughter' Alayne (Sansa) later on at the Eyrie that definitely could be taken for sexual exploitation or predatory... so maybe that's the angle they're going for this season ... evolving Baelish into some sort of creepy weasel pedophile who spies on his clients through peepholes and threatens his whores with torturous punishments. It seems very out of character from the Littlefinger we knew in the books and I really wish the producers would just take lead from Martin, who wrote his characters so perfectly there's no need for them to embellish them in any way at all.Littlefinger is NOT a pimp in the modern sense of the word. He's a businessman and a man from very low noble birth who has managed to work his way up the ladder right onto the small council because he's a master at making money and buying people's allegiances. His personality is getting more and more skewed as the series goes on. I don't really like him this creepy.

What would you call looking at Sansa as though she has no clothes on? Or wanting to get married to her when her father died, or treating her as a Cat-replacement object? You may not know it, but modern day pimps consider themselves businessmen too. Sexual exploitation and manipulation are the very means by which LF got into the game. Sleeping with Lysa Tully, making her believe he loved her so that she would get her husband to employ him etc etc. I'm not saying the man doesn't have brains, but he's based his whole move from lowborn foster child to small council member on the backs of women. Threatening Cersei was uncharacteristic, I agree, simply because book LF would be smarter to threaten a Lannister still in power. But book LF would absolutely threaten a low class prostitute with no power. Why is this so hard to fathom?

If they didn't fear him, they would not be manageable and Littlefinger, is smart enough to know that a battered and bruised whore is useless, so psychological abuse in the smartest way to go, because no one can see the damage.  He gave her the day off simply because she was not going to make him any money that day.  It's about controlling his product and making a profit, nothing more and nothing less.  These women/girls are disposable and easily replaced.  If they didn't know that upon arrival, they will learn very quickly what the rules are.   No one would care if a whore wound up dead.  Most would say that she deserved it, simply because she was a whore.  Pimps know this.  I liked the scene being that it shows Littlefingers true colors.

He is a pimp in the books, but no one cares because brothels/whorehouses are acceptable businesses in Westeros. He held meetings with Catelyn and Ned inside one of his brothels. Because he was able to make money for other high lords and was backed by John Arryn, is the only reason that he sits on the high council. Without those connections he would still only be Littlefinger the brothel owner.

1450	Ferrum Aeternum	2012-04-10	I would gladly have traded last season's LF/Ros scene for this one, as this one just as effectively (if not moreso) portrays LF as a cutthroat who will fuck someone over at the drop of a hat.
As it is, this scene was redundant in its purpose as we already know what a dick HBO-LF is, a fact the producers seemingly feel the need to remind us of at every turn.

He presents himself as an arrogant and well connected guy that can help you out is oh so many ways. He makes himself available to everyone to curry favors and establish himself as a great ally while he builds his power base. And for the most part that's all a fair presentation. Littlefinger generally rewards people around him, makes himself and everyone money, and knows what's going on as well as anyone in politics.As far as Ros goes, Littlefinger doesnt owe her anything and he doesnt need to be nice to her. He's being a lot nicer to her than most pimps would be. He does her a favor by giving her the day off to grieve and makes it clear that she can't cost him business when she comes back the next day. That's more than fair. If Ros's job is to make customers happy (she is a whore after all) then she's being pretty damned unprofessional when she chases away customers with her crying. Yes, it's understandable why she's upset. But you can't insult your customers when they havent done anything wrong either.

If anything, he's the opposite of that. Littlefinger pursues power through various means. Go do a search on the definition of sexual predator and think about it for a few minutes. (or use this one: The term sexual predator is used pejoratively to describe a person seen as obtaining or trying to obtain sexual contact with another person in a metaphorically "predatory" manner.)You can make a very weak case that everything that Littlefinger has done has been in pursuit of Sansa, but that's clearly just conjecture. Littlefinger's nature isn't sexually predatory. He's just a very smart and successful guy with low moral character. He may do a lot of things that you don't agree with, but that doesn't mean he's a sex predator.

1453	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-04-10	Oh, and while it's not really a big deal, I thought the scene where Littlefinger wipes some "fluids" off the whore's mouth was disgusting. I hate to sound like a prude, but I do NOT want to see that level of sexual content on Game of Thrones. HBO went too far with that one.lol but you are a prude.anyone who can't even bring themselves to the point of typing, sperm, semen or cum and instead puts fluids in quotation marks is pretty damned prudish.the scene was a bit much, it was a bit of comedic relief in that it shows his respect for the patrons of his establishment.also it won't have been too traumatizing for the actress involved as she is used to having real loads on her face.
1454	ChromeWeasel	2012-04-10	I would gladly have traded last season's LF/Ros scene for this one, as this one just as effectively (if not moreso) portrays LF as a cutthroat who will fuck someone over at the drop of a hat.As it is, this scene was redundant in its purpose as we already know what a dick HBO-LF is, a fact the producers seemingly feel the need to remind us of at every turn.**Edited for clarityOut of curiosity, how would you have handled Ros in Littlefinger's situation?

What would you call that?  I can't quite recall who exactly it was for, but there are instances in the books where he discusses acquiring boys to give to this lord or that lord as payment.  It's pretty explicit that he's not just giving them boys as squires.  These be unwilling bed boys he's talking about.  Sounds predatory to me.
1456	Nymeria's pup	2012-04-10	Ok so probably repeating others, but I was unhappy with the Ros scene and will continue to be...unless somewhere down the road we get some sort of payoff from it. Who was LF talking about? Was this a scene to show LF's cruelty and to foreshadow somone else? Either way though, there were many other plot lines that could have been covered rather than this scene pulled from thin air. For a show that has been cutting characters out why would it spend time on a made up character? I know that this series is not going to follow the books 100% and that is ok as long as the spirit is kept intact. So far this season I feel like series LF is not like book LF. The writers made him appear postively stupid in the first episode during his interaction with Cerci. Book LF would never have been so clumsy and blatent. Just as I feel like book LF would not make such an explicit threat like he did to Ros. There is very little subtlety in LF so far this season. Plus double eew on the whore clean up /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' />

1457	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2012-04-10	Littlefinger doesnt present himself as a nice guy. He presents himself as an arrogant and well connected guy that can help you out is oh so many ways. He makes himself available to everyone to curry favors and establish himself as a great ally while he builds his power base. And for the most part that's all a fair presentation. Littlefinger generally rewards people around him, makes himself and everyone money, and knows what's going on as well as anyone in politics.As far as Ros goes, Littlefinger doesnt owe her anything and he doesnt need to be nice to her. He's being a lot nicer to her than most pimps would be. He does her a favor by giving her the day off to grieve and makes it clear that she can't cost him business when she comes back the next day. That's more than fair. If Ros's job is to make customers happy (she is a whore after all) then she's being pretty damned unprofessional when she chases away customers with her crying. Yes, it's understandable why she's upset. But you can't insult your customers when they havent done anything wrong either. Yes he does try and come off as a nice guy to Sansa and the Arryn banner men who he needs. I never said that LF owed Ros anything. He is a slimy pimp, period.

Littlefinger's nature isn't sexually predatory. He's just a very smart and successful guy with low moral character.

1459	ChromeWeasel	2012-04-10	Book LF preys on the weak in order to obtain another person for the use of another person's sexual predation.  What would you call that?

1460	ChromeWeasel	2012-04-10	So, he's not grooming Sansa, right?I'm not sure what he's doing with Sansa. He may be obsessed with her and possibly trying to succeed at his failed relationship with her mother. He may only be using her as a venue to accumulate more power. We really don't know. Either way, it's not what you wouldnormally call a sexual predator. Littlefinger is not pursuing his victims for SEX. If anything, he's fairly disinterested in sex from what we've seen. Littlefinger does seem most interested in power. He's definitely ambitious and morally questionable. That doesnt make him a sexual predator as the term is used today.

Rape is about power.and control. And he has absolutely set everything up so Sansa is completely under his power and in his control and feeling as if she has no choice but to obey him. I'm not going to guess at the author's intent with the storyline but my opinion is Sansa is nothing but an object to to be possessed the way Cat never could be much like Ted Bundy's victims possessed a resemblance to a woman that had spurned him earlier in life.

1462	Catelyn	2012-04-10	Everything with Ros is a waste of time. We know Petyr is evil. Was putting a dagger to Ned's throat not enough to convince the audience? They're forcing more screen time on Petyr than he deserves this season.Totally agree! Too much Petyr Baelish. And that's not needed...I mean the audience should have understood how cunning (in a bad way) he is. He's selfish, has a fix on Cat and he's greedy!
1463	ChromeWeasel	2012-04-10	A sexual predator does not pursue a victim for sex. Rape is about power.and control.You are dead wrong in that statement. Sexual Predators absolutely are pursuing someone else for SEX. Thats the very essence of the term. Rape isn't even worth getting into here, since it's not relevant to the discussion.
1464	Tywin's bastard	2012-04-10	I liked the scene. The show has taken the decision to show Petyr a bit more and in that regard it did a fine job. I require more of myself than to be a slave of what I've already read so I'm fine with some changes.
As for the the comments that the scene is not needed because we know Littlefinger is bad, that just makes me laugh. Like we didn't learn that Joffrey is a sadistic bastard in the first book and, by your arguments, therefor could have been without his constant cruelty...
1465	bloodymime	2012-04-10	You are dead wrong in that statement. Sexual Predators absolutely are pursuing someone else for SEX. Thats the very essence of the term. Rape isn't even worth getting into here, since it's not relevant to the discussion.Keep reading on the wikipedia page you took your definition from and you'll see it has little do with sex and everything to do with power and control.
1466	Envie	2012-04-10	/smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> Well, I'm convinced we must be reading two different books. Littlefinger has always been creepy. What would you call looking at Sansa as though she has no clothes on? Or wanting to get married to her when her father died, or treating her as a Cat-replacement object? You may not know it, but modern day pimps consider themselves businessmen too. Sexual exploitation and manipulation are the very means by which LF got into the game. Sleeping with Lysa Tully, making her believe he loved her so that she would get her husband to employ him etc etc. I'm not saying the man doesn't have brains, but he's based his whole move from lowborn foster child to small council member on the backs of women. Threatening Cersei was uncharacteristic, I agree, simply because book LF would be smarter to threaten a Lannister still in power. But book LF would absolutely threaten a low class prostitute with no power. Why is this so hard to fathom?Why is it hard to fathom? You're speculating what Littlefinger absolutely might do if YOU wrote the book because that's your opinion but that doesn't mean I or anyone else has to think its that simple. Or as we have seen in the show, HBO producers write it how they think it should be played. Myself and most others? We're referring to how Littlefinger is written by George R R Martin and he is not that weird, creepy, predatory. Sure, there are some low-ball slimy things he does, but not act like a thug. A lot is left up to the imagination of the reader, which is one of the gifts Martin has as a writer. He never HAD to say this sort of stuff the way HBO is hitting us over the head with it. It was implied and the reader made their own character portraits from the scenes given. I'm not sure why you're really bent on saying this absolutely would happen when it didn't. The scene was nowhere in the books nor was Ros or any of the brothel details.Of course this is just an adaptation and of course HBO is well within the boundaries of the plot to change character portrayals how they see fit for their viewing audience that typically, like past popular series (Sopranos, Deadwood etc) the truth is, viewers like their drama heavy and dripping with sex and violence. That's why these books DO translate well to film.I still stand by my opinion the scene gave little substance or value to the story. I've defended the addition of Ros to the cast many times, but not this time.

1467	Balefont	2012-04-10	The overuse of Ros makes her seem more important than she is - a blank wall that important characters speak at.
1468	brashcandy	2012-04-10	You are dead wrong in that statement. Sexual Predators absolutely are pursuing someone else for SEX. Thats the very essence of the term. Rape isn't even worth getting into here, since it's not relevant to the discussion.It's not just about sex, but even if you want to make that the strict criteria then yes, LF is a sexual predator and a pervert. He is procuring boys for Lyn Corbray and making Sansa kiss him and sit on his lap. What definition other than sexual predator do you want to apply to this behaviour?
1469	brashcandy	2012-04-10	Why is it hard to fathom? You're speculating what Littlefinger absolutely might do if YOU wrote the book because that's your opinion nothing else.

I already gave the example with looking at Sansa as though she's naked; add to this kissing her while building the snow castle, wanting to marry her after Ned's death, giving Jeyne over to be trained in his brothels, sourcing boys for Lyn Corbray, making Sansa kiss him, sit on his lap for "daddy time" and what in the name of the seven do you get but a sexual predator??I still stand by my opinion the scene gave little substance or value to the story. I've defended the addition of Ros to the cast many times, but not this time.It showed for viewers who might not be familiar with the books just what this man is capable of. Forget him as the wizard of the game for a moment, and think of the man's innate character, especially as it relates to his treatment of women in the text. It's despicable, and throughout this book he's going to be putting his plans in place for Sansa with Dontos etc. THIS is why viewers needed to understand that he's not simply a suave game player, he's a low life pimp who doesn't care past his bottom line. If this doesn't jive with the image you have of LF in your head, then too bad.

This is a man who takes this young girl and proceeds to strip away her identity to the point of even changing her name, makes her believe she is complicit in the murder of her aunt all to make sure nobody knows who she is but him thus making her believe she is completely helpless and dependant upon him to stay safe and when she does good and obeys he rewards her with secrets that make her feel special and even more beholden to him.And people are going to want to say this was for her own good to keep her protected, kind of just same way Littlefinger convinces Sansa of the same but if that was what mattered at all to him he would have let her go on to marry Willas Tyrell but what good is Sansa being safe unless he gets to own her the way he could never own Cat. Everything he does with Sansa is to make sure he and he alone possesses her.

In fact, he's implicated her in multiple murders - Dontos's, Joffrey's and most recently Lysa's. He's now going for Sweetrobin's. He also took away a small hope for happiness that she had in Willas Tyrell to guarantee that she would remain as his pawn. He may be sincere in making her a queen, but he's clearly got designs on her sexually as well, and becoming a player at the cost of everything you value is not what I would consider winning at the game.

That's very true about Joffrey too, a very big threat he can hold over her as long as the Lannisters have any power and a very good reason for him to make sure she's the one holding the poison when it always seemed strangely convoluted for them to use her hairpiece to hold the poison when there doesn't seem to be any actual need for it and only adds to the risk of discovery.I also think Littlefinger making her believe she can be a player instead of a pawn is just another way of controlling her by making her feel special and different. In the long term Sansa getting any kind of knowledge outside of what he spoonfeeds her would only defeat Littlefingers plans, the day she goes outside of his sphere of influence is going to be the day that she finds out he helped betray her father.

I've felt plenty strongly enough about people's criticisms of scenes in the past, particularly in defending Ros because so many seem do despise her addition or usefulness. Again and again I've pointed out how vital her role has been in 'sexposition' with Tyrion, Theon, Pycelle, etc.. I guess we're going to have to agree to disagree on just how slimy and predatory we each feel Littlefinger would behave in relation to his business assets. Some others have said they don't think Littlefinger would have that much direct physical involvement with his whores to micro manage their every little daily need or behavior. But, that's the way HBO is doing it so that's what we've got to accept whether we think his character matches that of the books or not.Also, I had forgotten Littlefinger's part in the Jeyne as Arya switcheroo plot. It's never detailed explicitly in the books but its quite possibly another area Littlefinger's slimy methods coerced someone into doing something against their will. I always did wonder where she vanished to all that time between the time she was taken from Sansa's room until the time she turns up as the fake Arya heading to Winterfell and a Bolton wedding.
1476	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-10	Even if I agreed with your statement, none of that particularly fits the definition of a sexual predator.

Littlefinger's character doesnt fit that very well.The term 'sexual predator' is a modern term.  This term exists today (and did not exist in a medieval setting such as GRRM has created) because we modern folk have made it up.  It's the best modern term available to help describe Littlefinger.  The best thing about GRRM's writing is his use of subtly. Since we don't have a Littlefinger POV, we only learn about his nature through other characters observations.  We learn through these other POV's that Littlefinger runs a brothel, we learn that he mistreats the whores in his brothel, we learn that he sells the very vulnerable off to other predators, we learn that he preys on Lysa by using sex and the memory of sex, we learn that he's using very sexual behavior to groom and coerce Sansa.  This is predatory behavior. I truly and honestly do not understand your confusion.  Is there another term that you think more aptly describes Littlefinger?

1478	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-04-10	Just because the lowliness of LF character wasn't broached upon as much in the early instalments of ASOIAF does not mean it is nonsensical to let the audience know now that indeed he is a scumbag.
D&D have said they are approaching the show as an adaptation of the series, not a 1 book = 1 season scenario.
It is sensible that they are showcasing this side of LF, it isn't POV like the books, we don't get to see the face he puts on for people like Ned and Cat, we see him as he is.  It is grasping at straws to defend his character and deny he wouldn't be as foul as he is currently portrayed given how lowly his later depicted actions are.
It seems to be more than just an opinion.  Don't feel so bad for liking such a creep.  I know people that have unhealthy obsessions with serial killers.  At least this guy is fictitious.
1479	congokong	2012-04-10	I have to disagree. I think this scene was incredibly vital to showing us the kind of man Littlefinger truly is. He doesn't simply make a living off women like some happy go lucky brothel owner, he exploits them and really doesn't give a shit past his bottom line. This gets to the heart of the man's character, and establishes for tv viewers just why his relationship with Sansa will be so dangerous for the girl. With HBO already running the risk of glamorising prostitution via the brothel sex scenes, I think this part was extremely useful in showing the seedy underbelly, and how men like LF make a profit whilst seliing these girls to the highest bidder.I don't think anyone would say this is scene was out of character for Petyr (unlike last week's scene). This scene gives good insight... if the show had time for it. The problem is more that educating the audience on Petyr's selfishness is low on the priority list of topics. There is too much left out to justify this scene; and was likely made as an excuse to give Ros more screen time. The writers also seems very interested in pushing Petyr's presence on the show while neglecting others. This business with him going to Renly's camp for example and likely seeing Catelyn again is unnecessary, even if there was enough time on the show for every detail that was in the books.
1480	Im no Ser	2012-04-10	The TV Peytr is a different character.  The medium isn't great at subtlety, and in the books he's all subtlety.  TV Peytr gets snippy with Cersei (throwing the incest accusation in her face?  Where's the upside in that?) and engages in extended monologues about how he hates everyone born higher than he is.
He's also much more hands on as a pimp.  In the novels I always got the sense that the brothels were just one more item in a long list of investments.  Based on Tyrion's description of LF's financial books, LF seems to have invented leveraged investing (Tyrion's a very bright guy, and struggles to follow how Baelish is balancing his books).  Managing a single upscale brothel is a waste of his talents.
The show is going in a different direction.  TV LF doesn't have the same level of self-control and seems less skilled (and at a diminished level of importance) as a financier.
1481	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2012-04-10	Why is it hard to fathom? You're speculating what Littlefinger absolutely might do if YOU wrote the book because that's your opinion but that doesn't mean I or anyone else has to think its that simple. Or as we have seen in the show, HBO producers write it how they think it should be played. Myself and most others? We're referring to how Littlefinger is written by George R R Martin and he is not that weird, creepy, predatory. Sure, there are some low-ball slimy things he does, but not act like a thug. A lot is left up to the imagination of the reader, which is one of the gifts Martin has as a writer. He never HAD to say this sort of stuff the way HBO is hitting us over the head with it. It was implied and the reader made their own character portraits from the scenes given. I'm not sure why you're really bent on saying this absolutely would happen when it didn't. The scene was nowhere in the books nor was Ros or any of the brothel details.Of course this is just an adaptation and of course HBO is well within the boundaries of the plot to change character portrayals how they see fit for their viewing audience that typically, like past popular series (Sopranos, Deadwood etc) the truth is, viewers like their drama heavy and dripping with sex and violence. That's why these books DO translate well to film.I still stand by my opinion the scene gave little substance or value to the story. I've defended the addition of Ros to the cast many times, but not this time.I still stand by mine that they portray Littlefinger exactly the way that I, and obviously the GOT show creators, pictured him.
1482	Clariana	2012-04-11	Perhaps there is a gender division here, with the ladies describing LF as a predator and some of the guys not quite seeing it?
He is my favourite character in the book but I see him very much as a predator.  In my view he is clearly "grooming" Sansa, depriving her of her family roots, hedging her around with threats, isolating her physically and psychically... In order to become the focus of her existence.
I'm a woman BTW.
1483	Clariana	2012-04-11	The writers also seems very interested in pushing Petyr's presence on the show while neglecting others. This business with him going to Renly's camp for example and likely seeing Catelyn again is unnecessary, even if there was enough time on the show for every detail that was in the books.I think there is a clear reason for this, don't forget GRR Martin is on board, I suspect Petyr will be a major player, hence the continual underlining his character is being subject to.
1484	Tywin's bastard	2012-04-11	I don't think anyone would say this is scene was out of character for Petyr (unlike last week's scene). This scene gives good insight... if the show had time for it. The problem is more that educating the audience on Petyr's selfishness is low on the priority list of topics.

This business with him going to Renly's camp for example and likely seeing Catelyn again is unnecessary, even if there was enough time on the show for every detail that was in the books.I just don't understand how anyone can think that Ros' screen time is ever about her. Every single scene she's in is about some other, important character and she's being used instead of having X amount of extras in various scenes. Both for familiarity, and in order to have someone that can actually act with the bigger actors.
1485	ChromeWeasel	2012-04-11	The term 'sexual predator' is a modern term.  This term exists today (and did not exist in a medieval setting such as GRRM has created) because we modern folk have made it up.  It's the best modern term available to help describe Littlefinger.  The best thing about GRRM's writing is his use of subtly. Since we don't have a Littlefinger POV, we only learn about his nature through other characters observations.  We learn through these other POV's that Littlefinger runs a brothel, we learn that he mistreats the whores in his brothel, we learn that he sells the very vulnerable off to other predators, we learn that he preys on Lysa by using sex and the memory of sex, we learn that he's using very sexual behavior to groom and coerce Sansa.  This is predatory behavior. I truly and honestly do not understand your confusion.  Is there another term that you think more aptly describes Littlefinger?Have you taken the time to go look up the term sexual predator? It seems like you assume that because Littlefinger has some qualities that seem predatory, and some association with sexual activities, that he can be qualified as a sexual predator because it sounds nice to you. That's not the way it works. I already gave out the definition of sexual predator as I found it online. That term does not apply well to Littlefinger. Sexual predators are focused on sex, and use predatory tactics to stalk their victims. That's not Littlefingers history. He has not been focused on sex at any part of the story to date.Because the term sexual predator doesnt apply well to Littlefinger, many other terms are better. Calling Littlefinger a criminal mastermind is far more appropriate, for example. But Id wager many people dont like that term as much because it's not much of a personal insult. And what most people are trying to do is cast a character like Littlefinger in the most despicable terms possible, even if they knowingly misuse terms that dont apply.

Calling the man a criminal mastermind is all well and good if you ignore the other unsavoury aspects of his behaviour like grooming Sansa and sourcing young boys for Lyn Corbray. Does "criminal mastermind" apply to this too? What LF is doing is sexually exploiting young children (in the specific case of Cobray) for his own profit. In the case of Sansa, he is isolating her, making her feel as though she can only trust him, and placing her in uncomfortable sexual situations, such as the kissing on the mouth and making her sit in his lap. It is sexually exploitative because he is abusing the power he has over her to compel her into doing these things. I don't know why you have such a problem with a term like sexual predator being used to describe this man's activities, but perhaps instead of accusing others of wanting to denigrate LF, you should look more closely into why you are denying the textual evidence of his sexual predation?

1488	lyvyathan	2012-04-11	A lot of people in the initial thoughts thread, like me, thought the scene with Ros and Littlefinger was unnecessary and wasted time in the episode that could have gone to other more worthy story lines.Apparently the producers felt it was necessary to better flesh out just how 'sinister' Peter can be based on their interview here:Inside the Episode:  http://www.youtube.c...ture=plpp_videoAfter watching this narrative of several of the scenes, I better understand the reasoning for the crying Ros scene, but I'm not entirely convinced it was still that necessary. Everyone by now knows how despicable Littlefinger is and how dangerous he can be. Those who haven't read the books undoubtedly believe him to be fairly slimy and immoral even if they don't know yet what's to come with Sansa and the Eyrie, etc.Perhaps the producers are wrangling with how to chisel down all the political info that was in book 2 and make it easier to digest for television viewers. Dumbing it down would require a lot more exposition and scene manipulating I suppose. Maybe since they added that scene last week with Cersei's play on Littlefinger (which made him look weak), they felt it necessary to add a scene this week to show just how powerful he is, if only behind the scenes in secret.Yes, as D&D stated, at the base of Littlefinger's suave well groomed appearance and carefully controlled speech is a pimp. He's still just a pimp trying to turn a buck at the expense of human lives.I hear you. But the added dialogue for HBO LF seems baffling to me when there are better ways to do it without sledgehammering the point through. There were many ways they could have done that - I'm sure you could also imagine a number yourself. We already knew that LF was a treacherous bastard in Season 1. If they wanted to have him be seen as a cold heartless pimp - a brief scene could be shown where he's letting a pado-Lord into a room filled with terrified very young girls - after taking his payment. Door closes. Girls start to scream horribly. Viewer's imagination takes care of the rest. LF walks off, jiggling his gold purse and not giving a damn.The problem with the HBO dialogue and the Ros crying scene- not to mention the semen wipe - is that it unnecessarily takes away time that could have been devoted to other important events - like explaining who or what were Mel and Stennis and Dragonstone etc..etc..Yeah I get it that it serves to titillate the audience. But really that's plenty of other opportunities for that. I always thought that the sex scenes in the books served to show how wretched the lives of the ordinary folk were and how horrible things could get when violent men were unleashed - hello Ramsay Snow.Frankly I'm still upset about 201 when LF openly mocks Cersei and then compounds it with a condesending lecture on knowledge and power - in the same way he did with Varys in Season 1 - anyone familiar with the books would realize that LF was much too clever to do such a stupid act.Having said that- I'm not too surprised because HBO chose to revamp Renly into a stereotypical gay character. I really wanted to see someone that looked like a younger version of Robert - and who would otherwise seem a sterotypical "king" candidate - ie like the actor who plays King Henry 8th in the Tudors. Then we find out later he's gay - now that's a big surprise we didn't get. Instead we get gay blow jobs and semen wipes. Sorry didn't mean to offend.

In order to become the focus of her existence.I'm a woman BTW.I agree that Littlefinger is a predator. He finds and takes advantage of mistakes made by his opponents. He also pretty exploitative and he's got low moral standards. That doesnt necessarily make him a sexual predator though. That term has a pretty specific meaning. It's not just the word sexual thrown together with the term predator on a whim.We don't really know what's up with Sansa yet. His focus on her might be sexual, or it may be that hes using her to accumulate more power and influence. He may have no sexual interests in Sansa. The bottom line is that we really dont know what's going to happen with that storyline yet, never mind figuring out Littlefinger's motives behind it. Using Sansa to call Littlefinger a sexual predator is just conjecture at this point.
1490	lyvyathan	2012-04-11	Well, my definition of pimp states that this is a guy who exploits whores and takes away the money they earn for his own benefit. Littlefinger does not command Sansa to have sex with other women. Thus he is not a pimp in his relationship with her. He may want to take her into his own bed eventually, but I very much doubt he intends to make her a prostitute.Well but at the same time - don't you think he is trying to manipulate her for his own ends? Of course ,he doesn't command her to have sex with him but his careful manipulation of the young girl's emotions is surely wrong don't you think?
1491	bloodymime	2012-04-11	You clearly havent looked up the term sexual predator yet. Go do that and stop trying to redefine the word. Go look up mastermind while you're at it.Here, taking from the exact same site I'm sure that you used.  "The term sexual predator is used pejoratively to describe a person seen as obtaining or trying to obtain sexual contact with another person in a metaphorically "predatory" manner. Analogous to how a predator hunts down its prey, so the sexual predator is thought to "hunt" for his or her sex partners. People who commit sex crimes, such as rape or child sexual abuse, are commonly referred to as sexual predators."Unless you seriously want to argue that rape and child abuse have sex as a primary motivation then you need to realize that a sexual predator is a person focused on control and power rather then sex. Kind of like how a person might use a naive woman's love to further his ambitions or play kissing games with a girl one minute and insist she call him father the next or runs brothels that includes exploiting young girls.I understand you don't want Littlefinger being thought of as only a sexual predator and that's fine. Mastermind is going a little too far to though. He's a little man playing little games.

Using Sansa to call Littlefinger a sexual predator is just conjecture at this point.I don't know what kind of "definition" you found that seems to make you believe that the only way we could classify LF as a sexual predator is if he outright has sex with Sansa. The book has shown the man kissing her and making her sit on his lap. It is truly mystifying what it is about that you find hard to consider as being sexually exploitative, in addition to running brothels, training young girls to be sex workers, and sourcing boys for a paedophile. Sexual predators often don't have to take their pleasure from sex either, but can rely on touching, kissing, intimacy, and other such activities and situations to abuse their victims.
1493	Sadie Stark	2012-04-11	I really couldn't agree more, with the amount of time it took up they could have spent more time elsewhere. Considering they've got so much to get through... 
I dont know if it is worse if you've read the books, because you're there at the screen shouting what on earth is this, why has this been featured! 
I spoke to another massive GoT fan and he said he was really happy with it all, I guess I need to look at it from the point that some of the viewers won't have read the books so maybe they need a little bit extra to be able to keep up with what has been missed out. But thinking about it more, there's stuff that happens later in this book which will paint Littlefinger to be not that pleasant. 
There was a scene from last week when he was with Cersei and they had a bit of banter, I thought for what purpose is this really! 
I don't seem to be as near as critical as I was last week, hopefully as the episodes come and go I'll be a bit more relaxed about it all.

What does this mean for the real world when some of us can't even recognize the signs of sexual abuse. When a grown man is using his power to make a young girl sit on his lap, taking kisses from her under the guise of being "daddy" and we still can't recognize that person as a sexual predator. It's honestly scary.
1495	Lord Varys	2012-04-11	I never doubted that Littlefinger takes advantage of and manipulates Sansa. That's not the point here. My point is that TV Littlefinger's treatment of Ros in 'The Night Lands' is out of character for Littlefinger.
1. Littlefinger is no pimp. He owns brothels, but he does not run them personally. This includes that Littlefinger does not punish/teach his whores personally. This was (somewhat) weird last season in the brothel scene, but this was too much in my opinion.
2. Littlefinger is motto is not 'Knowledge is power'. If he had a motto it would be 'Money is power'. The man buys and manipulates people, he is not Varys 2.0; which means, his brothels are not Littlefinger's private secret service thing.
3. Littlefinger would not treat his confidants/lieutenants this way. Besides all talk about 'You can't trust anyone'-stuff, Littlefinger (and Varys) are more dependent than anyone on trusted and loyal servants/tools/right hands. Littlefinger does trust people like Lothor Brune or Oswell Kettleblack, and he is also likely somewhat idolized by these people. They are, after all, more or less lowborn scum like he, and together they rise against the establishment. 'The North remembers' indicated that Ros apparently feels similar towards Littlefinger when she instructed Daisy about 'Lord Baelish' and was confident that Slynt would back down when she mentioned Littlefinger's name.
I'm not that sure about that sexual predator thing. Littlefinger is not motivated by sexual desires all that much. He did not even treat Lysa like shit. He married her, and he made her (somewhat) happy. He would not killed her had she not threatened and tried to kill Sansa. His affections/desires toward Sansa are somewhat weird, but this is not a pattern in my opinion. He is only attracted to Sansa because she is Catelyn 2.0, and he honestly loved Catelyn. Despite owning brothels, Littlefinger does not care about sex and women. That was even established with TV Littlefinger back last season when he rejected Ros's invitation to join them.
TV Littlefinger is just a weird and inconclusive character. The subtlety of book Littlefinger would have worked in the series just as well. Considering Gillen's screen time they would have more than enough to hint his true intentions. Especially since they are doing exactly the right thing with Varys, so I really don't see the point with stupid/clumsy Littlefinger...

It's also a prevalent misconception that sex crimes actually have anything to do with sex. We even use the word to preface terms like sex crimes or sexual predator so anyone unable to look past the words into the actual meaning of these acts is just going to keep believing the false notions using the word sex implies.This also has nothing to do with transferring modern day values onto Westeros. Good grief even Tyrion, who is one of the last people I'd want to use as a moral compass, considers Sansa to be too young to be taken advantage of. I need to find and read the part again but I also seem to remember Cersei not wanting to be told what Littlefinger was going to do with Jeyne Poole even though she alread knew.

It's reasonable to think that he doesnt want to take advantage of Sansa because she is too young. It's also reasonable to think that age has nothing to do with it, and Tyrion doesnt want to take advantage of Sansa because his family murdered her father and holds her prisoner. It may have more to do with the fact that Sansa, regardless of age is still a virgin and an overall innocent and decent person in a horrible situation.I'd wager that Tyrion's motives lean toward not wanting to litterally screw a sweet girl that his family has already figuratively screwed. That's because his character has typically distanced himself from his family. Tyrion sees himself as having more honor than his brother and sister and father.I think the focus on Sansa being young is more of a projection made by readers because they feel that any 14 year old girl should not be having sex. It's an understandable emotion, but it's not really relevant to Westeros society. And it doesnt necessarily correspond to Tyrion's character.
1498	ChromeWeasel	2012-04-11	What's troubling to me is the blatant dismissal of textual evidence which shows how the man is grooming Sansa and beginning a pattern of abuse that will in all likelihood escalate.

It's honestly scary.There was a good deal of evidence that Littlefinger was helping Ed Stark as well. That didnt bear out in the long run.Also, you should take heart that this is all just a story and no one is actually getting taken advantage of. If you're really scared by the conversations here you probably need to walk back a bit and remember that this is all just fantasy. We are commenting on our own interpretations of a made up story in a fake world. What Littlefinger is doing with Sansa is going to be what GRR Martin tells us that he does. He does an admirable job making the characters believable. But you can't assume that your interpretations of what's going on is going to be accurate yet. Martin may not see things the way you do, and may write his story to end differently than you assume. Considering the twists and turns that this story has taken, I don't think that's too unlikely of an outcome.
1499	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-11	Have you taken the time to go look up the term sexual predator? It seems like you assume that because Littlefinger has some qualities that seem predatory, and some association with sexual activities, that he can be qualified as a sexual predator because it sounds nice to you. That's not the way it works. I already gave out the definition of sexual predator as I found it online. That term does not apply well to Littlefinger. Sexual predators are focused on sex, and use predatory tactics to stalk their victims. That's not Littlefingers history. He has not been focused on sex at any part of the story to date.Because the term sexual predator doesnt apply well to Littlefinger, many other terms are better. Calling Littlefinger a criminal mastermind is far more appropriate, for example. But Id wager many people dont like that term as much because it's not much of a personal insult. And what most people are trying to do is cast a character like Littlefinger in the most despicable terms possible, even if they knowingly misuse terms that dont apply.There is no dictionary, wikipedia article or legal review that will twist the term 'sexual predator' into one you are trying to make it.  Sexual predation is not simply about the act of sex itself. I'm not trying to make LF into a despicable character.  GRRM has made him a despicable character.  We are given very clear textual evidence that he is despicable. Sexual predation is part of his despicable nature.  This does not mean that there is no other term to describe his other behaviors.  He's had his hand in murder, exploitation, slavery, instigating war, giving false testimony, political corruption, and betrayal. One can be a sexual predator and still be a criminal mastermind (though I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say he's a mastermind, though he is most certainly head of a pretty nasty criminal ring).  LF can be a sexual predator and still be called an economic genius.  He can be a sexual predator and also be a good employer to his underlings.  He can even be a sexual predator and a predator of the vulnerable. He can even be a sexual predator and a good lover to his wife.Throughout the series, GRRM has given us a number of subtle hints that LF is a very dirty, despicable sexual predator.  We didn't see his sexual predation for certain until he brought Sansa to the Eyrie.  It doesn't matter if his future plans include using Sansa in his game of thrones power play, it doesn't even matter if he never sticks his penis inside her vagina.  The fact is, he is using every grooming technique in the sexual predators playbook.  We know Sansa is not comfortable being stared at as though she's naked, or being made to kiss this man that could be her father, nor being made to sit on his lap.  But we also know that LF is making her feel as though she must do it because he's all she's has. Sexual predation 101. If Littlefinger existed here in this time with our laws, his list of charges would be long and sexual predation would most definitely be on it.
1500	bloodymime	2012-04-11	Tyrion's motives for his sexual stance with Sansa are debatable. It's reasonable to think that he doesnt want to take advantage of Sansa because she is too young. It's also reasonable to think that age has nothing to do with it, and Tyrion doesnt want to take advantage of Sansa because his family murdered her father and holds her prisoner. It may have more to do with the fact that Sansa, regardless of age is still a virgin and an overall innocent and decent person in a horrible situation.I'd wager that Tyrion's motives lean toward not wanting to litterally screw a sweet girl that his family has already figuratively screwed. That's because his character has typically distanced himself from his family. Tyrion sees himself as having more honor than his brother and sister and father.I think the focus on Sansa being young is more of a projection made by readers because they feel that any 14 year old girl should not be having sex. It's an understandable emotion, but it's not really relevant to Westeros society. And it doesnt necessarily correspond to Tyrion's character.It kind of helps that he consistently thinks of her as too young and refers to her as his child bride.I also want to acknowledge the possibilty that your difficulty in understanding the term sexual predator could be due to a language barrier. I don't know where you are from but here in the u.s. where the term originated it is always understood to refer to a person committing sex crimes. I've already explained how sex crimes, despite using the word sex, have little do with the sex as a primary motivation so I won't go into that again.
1501	Envie	2012-04-11	I hear you. But the added dialogue for HBO LF seems baffling to me when there are better ways to do it without sledgehammering the point through. There were many ways they could have done that - I'm sure you could also imagine a number yourself. We already knew that LF was a treacherous bastard in Season 1. If they wanted to have him be seen as a cold heartless pimp - a brief scene could be shown where he's letting a pado-Lord into a room filled with terrified very young girls - after taking his payment. Door closes. Girls start to scream horribly. Viewer's imagination takes care of the rest. LF walks off, jiggling his gold purse and not giving a damn.The problem with the HBO dialogue and the Ros crying scene- not to mention the semen wipe - is that it unnecessarily takes away time that could have been devoted to other important events - like explaining who or what were Mel and Stennis and Dragonstone etc..etc..Hi, thanks for putting the topic back on track while it keeps going astray for pages about whether or not Littlefinger is a pedophile or sexual predator. That's all later in the books / series dealing with Sansa and I'm sure there will be exhaustingly long debates raging over how inappropriate or wrong it all is. In fact, i'm curious whether they'll even allow a kiss between the actors for LF and Sansa considering how touchy most are watching anything pedo related. But that's LATER!My topic is about Ros, and the scene most are voting as unnecessary filler that does nothing to further anyone's opinion of Littlefinger's reputation as most, even those who never read the books, were pretty clear on that from season 1.I quoted your remark because its a good point I probably failed to make. There are plenty of ways to continue showcasing Lord Baelish and 'money is power' (not knowledge as he says to cersei because we all know LF gets his power from buying people for knowledge). Plenty of opportunities we've already had and didn't need. I liked Ros in season 1 because she gave much needed sexposition opportunities to reveal bits of secrets and plots that can't otherwise easily be translated from book to film.In season 2, so far, it feels like they aren't quite sure what to do with Ros anymore, but she's cast for another season so for two episodes they've 'thrown her in' two scenes like some boring side dish just to make the meal look bigger. They left out major scenes with major characters altogether this week (hello what's Robb up to...you know, in the WAR?) in favor of a rather long, tediously whispered scene with Littlefinger being scary little pimp villain? Really? And folks here continue to defend it and the producers opinion of its importance? Whatever.

IMO, this whole conversation about Sansa is integral to appreciating the value of that scene, so I don't consider it off topic at all. The scene wasn't about Ros, it was meant to highlight LF, and he is one of the major, major players in the Game of Thrones. Arguably everything that has gone wrong can be traced back to his initial machinations. I think the scene with Ros was meant to parallel the one Varys has with Tyrion and Shae. To show these men appearing to be all charming, but the veiled threats are underneath the surface. These aren't nice men, no matter how much they appear to be so, and in LF's case, seeing him threatening Ros was useful, because he's involved later on in the sexual enslavement of a child - taking Jeyne to one of his brothels to be trained, and in the sexual grooming of another. He abuses women under his control essentially, so we see it now with Ros, and we see it later with Lysa, Jeyne and Sansa. It isn't just simply to highlight that "money is power" to LF and I disagree that this is his motto anyways. It's to show that money, sex, power are all mixed into the twisted operations of this man.

I know I personally am going too far afield and looking ahead of where the tv series is. Are my remarks about Tyrion considered spoilers? If someone can let me know I'll delete them.I keep having this bad feeling Ros is being set up as a foil to Littlefinger. In the first season she is indeed going from one character to the next to reveal a more intimate view of their personalities but now at least so far she's being shown exclusively with Littlefinger and seemingly being setup to be the one that sees beneath his smiles and witty remarks. Hopefully that's just wild speculation though.

I've already explained how sex crimes, despite using the word sex, have little do with the sex as a primary motivation so I won't go into that again.Im American. Im not having difficulty understanding Sexual Predator as a term. In fact, I made sure that I looked it up before commenting on it. Its clear from reading most posts from people who are arguing against me that not everyone actually bothered to find out what the term actually means. It's a bit like people arguing over what a hate crime is and telling me that because someone was hateful and someone committed a crime, that said person committed a hate crime. That's not how things work. The term is what the term is. Littlefinger engaging in activities where other people are taken advantage of sexually do not make him fit the definition of a sexual predator. Saying that littlefinger may have had a factor into selling children into slavery dont make him a sexual predator. Those are despicable activities for sure, but suggesting that they indicate he's a sexual predator only confirms that someone doesnt understand what the term sexual predator represents.My take was that sexual predator is not a particularly good fit for Littlefinger. If you want to you can make an argument for him being a sex predator, but it's a weak argument that doesnt apply to Westeros at all and can't be borne out by the facts of what's going on in the books. The closest thing you come to is the conjecture that all of Littlefinger's acts are in hopes of bedding Sansa. That may or may not be true. Otherwise Littlefinger has shown very little interest in pursuing sex with anyone.

To answer your question, yes, I'm stating Ros and her crying scene wasn't necessary and they seem to think (from the interview clip I linked in my OP) that we all need to be hit over the head with a sledgehammer to understand Littlefinger is a bad man. Yes, I think we've got that now.Summary bottom line and then I'm done with the thread: 53-59 minutes of filming each week is precious little time to cram in so many details from the second book as it was a whopper of political intrigue and backstabbing leading up to the pinnacle of King's Landing battles. So many people die (important characters), so many people come into power (Tyrion) or lose power. All that massive plot and politics (of which only a fraction has anything to do with Littlefinger), and yet they feel its vitally necessary to waste 5 minutes of an episode on Littlefinger's evil whispers to a whore that didn't even exist in the books. That's my bottom line opinion. Everyone else certainly has their own as to whether or not its important and again, obviously the producers felt it was important or they wouldn't have taken the time to film it. I have agreed with almost ALL of the scenes cast so far in the series. This one little one annoyed me enough to start a discussion about it. I do appreciate everyone's differing perspectives on it and it has given me some things to think about (as in the future roles LF will take in the series in relation to how he's portrayed in the books) - so its all good!
1506	bloodymime	2012-04-11	Littlefinger is already shown as a 'bad man', but in a series that prides itself on not being just black and white, maybe they're trying to add some refinement to the character. It all comes down to opinion I know but I see Littlefinger as a man that sees people as objects or as he refers to them, as pawns. In the first book the only real reference he makes towards his whores is how they are a solid investment. Now here in the show he is explaining to a whore how she is nothing but an investment going bad and if that doesn't change all he can do is try to recoup his losses. Unless they start flashing subliminal messages of Peter standing over the Red Keep with puppet strings attached to his fingers they have to show some personal interaction with him to show how he sees people and his world.
As for the voyeurism scene I see that as a visual reminder that this is the Game of Thrones, there's always someody watching. They don't seem to be placing the same emphasis on the little birds in the show as the books where no one seems to talk without thinking about how there are always little birds about and there is truly no place private in Kings Landing.
1507	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-11	I think this entire thread, including the parts that veered off into what LF is doing in book 4 has really helped flesh out why this particular scene was included in the episode.  It's made me reconsider how necessary this type of scene is for a TV audience.  We book readers are given lots of subtle hints about LF's character in the first two books.  He's seems like a behind-the-scenes guy in the books because he's not often in the presence of POV characters.  However, once he steals Sansa, we learn all.  I don't think it would make sense for TV if Littlefinger is never seen to be doing anything despicable and then he suddenly shows up on a midnight boat carrying Sansa off to the Vale and says "surprise.  I was totally the man who was behind all the little plots.  I'm a dirty scoundrel and, without warning, I'm going to start grooming Sansa in a dirty sexual predator sort of way."  The crying Ros scene becomes a pretty important part to building up what we book readers know where LF is going.  I'm glad for how far into the future this discussion has gone because it reminds me that not everyone watching the show has or will read the books and I'm learning a little bit about how producers are able to successfully adapt an author's work.
1508	Tre	2012-04-11	Hi , am new to this forum so please bear with me,
Have any of you thought LF was telling Ros the story of Tyrions wife Tysha, (maybe a catch up from when Bronn, Shae and T where in the tent before the first battle), and a spoiler of sorts.
1509	The Monkey	2012-04-11	^ Seeing as Tysha was actually not a prostitute, but an ordinary peasant girl, that seem a bit unlikely.

1510	Daktura Nurovaia	2012-04-11	Regarding the technicality issues that seem to have arisen with the term 'sexual predator', here is a quote I took from http://www.stopsexoffenders.com:"For the most part, a child is seduced in the same way as one adult seduces another. The offender takes him places, buys him things, impresses the child with his own personality, makes the child feel loved and indebted to the offender, then becomes physical with the child. It starts subtly, by holding hands, placing an arm over the shoulder, or putting a hand in the lap, then graduates to more explicit conduct."That the Littlefinger/Sansa dynamics hasn't yet 'graduated to more explicit conduct' might be attributed to the fact of her 'maidenhead' being the key to securing the annulment of her marriage with Tyrion, conditio sine qua non for Littlefinger's plans for Sansa to come to fruition (or maybe we just did not have enough Littlefinger/Sansa chapters for their relationship to have played out that way yet). Anticipating any objections that might arise on the grounds that the article I quoted referred mostly to 8-9 year old children, I should add that Sansa's sexual immaturity and inexperience with the world do not make her, in my opinion and despite her being 13 years old, any less vulnerable to Littlefinger's seduction, who, to add insult to injury, took advantage of a peculiarly desperate situation to come out to her as a saviour, a love interest and the father she had just lost, preying on her need and her destitution so as to be able to exert over her an influence he would very likely never have under normal circumstances.That said, I really enjoyed this scene. I really loved the way it played out, initially as a bit of a comedic interlude, then taking on some really dark undertones and climaxing with a delicious bit of creep, courtesy of Littlefinger (whoever came up with the word 'transform' was genius, it really did it for that scene). I think it was really well crafted and executed and I can not stop showering HBO with praise for being bold enough to put it on screen (I'm a fan of AMC but It's little things like this that get me wondering if HBO wouldn't be able to do a better job with The Walking Dead, especially considering some of the more extreme stuff that will have to be transposed from the comics the coming season). Uniike many other posters, I totally do not think that this scene is out of character for Littlefinger. It really fits in with the perception I had of him and I am really enjoying the opportunity that the tv-show is giving me of seeing this brilliantly-crafted character fleshed out in more detail (I was very put-off with the scene with Cersei last week, though, that is undisputable).Regarding Ros (once again challenging the orthodoxy - shower me with all the hate that you might, I will still get a freebie next time I go to chez Littlefinger's), I think overall she was a good addition to the show and that the actress is doing quite a good job at portraying the character. Actually, I always felt it kind of weird that, in a world where most of the male characters frequent brothels or, at some point or other, commerce with a prostitute, no prominent role had been assigned to one, apart from Shae (I have to confess that, at some point while reading book 2, I actually thought that was where GRRM was heading with one of the Stark girls, but lewd George fortunately managed to keep it in his literary pants).      Regarding the outcry against all the allegedly gratuitous sex, hey, what's wrong with a bit of fucking? I mean, this is a story where one of the very few tidbits we get from fan-favourite Tyrion's past involves the love of his life being gang-raped by his father's soldiers and one wherein one of the elements that sets the plot in motion involves an instance of brotherly incest. No one can acuse GRRM of being coy. Why should the tv-crew adapting his work? Plus, I see added scenes and characters as a way of expanding the ASOIAF universe, whatever the setting, and I have to say I'm quite happy with the way they have been doing it so far.Just one final comment (this post seems to have gained a life of its own and I ended up writing much more than what I initially thought I had to say): I have been lurking for a while, but this is one of my first posts and I would really like to thank everyone on this site for having so much enrichened my ASOIAF experience throughout all of the time I have (invisible and undetected) been with you.

1512	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2012-04-11	I never doubted that Littlefinger takes advantage of and manipulates Sansa. That's not the point here. My point is that TV Littlefinger's treatment of Ros in 'The Night Lands' is out of character for Littlefinger.1. Littlefinger is no pimp. He owns brothels, but he does not run them personally. This includes that Littlefinger does not punish/teach his whores personally. This was (somewhat) weird last season in the brothel scene, but this was too much in my opinion.2. Littlefinger is motto is not 'Knowledge is power'. If he had a motto it would be 'Money is power'. The man buys and manipulates people, he is not Varys 2.0; which means, his brothels are not Littlefinger's private secret service thing.3. Littlefinger would not treat his confidants/lieutenants this way. Besides all talk about 'You can't trust anyone'-stuff, Littlefinger (and Varys) are more dependent than anyone on trusted and loyal servants/tools/right hands. Littlefinger does trust people like Lothor Brune or Oswell Kettleblack, and he is also likely somewhat idolized by these people. They are, after all, more or less lowborn scum like he, and together they rise against the establishment. 'The North remembers' indicated that Ros apparently feels similar towards Littlefinger when she instructed Daisy about 'Lord Baelish' and was confident that Slynt would back down when she mentioned Littlefinger's name.I'm not that sure about that sexual predator thing. Littlefinger is not motivated by sexual desires all that much. He did not even treat Lysa like shit. He married her, and he made her (somewhat) happy. He would not killed her had she not threatened and tried to kill Sansa. His affections/desires toward Sansa are somewhat weird, but this is not a pattern in my opinion. He is only attracted to Sansa because she is Catelyn 2.0, and he honestly loved Catelyn. Despite owning brothels, Littlefinger does not care about sex and women. That was even established with TV Littlefinger back last season when he rejected Ros's invitation to join them.TV Littlefinger is just a weird and inconclusive character. The subtlety of book Littlefinger would have worked in the series just as well. Considering Gillen's screen time they would have more than enough to hint his true intentions. Especially since they are doing exactly the right thing with Varys, so I really don't see the point with stupid/clumsy Littlefinger...A pimp is an agent for prostitutes who collects part of their earnings. The pimp may receive this money in return for advertising services, physical protection, or for providing (or in some cases monopolizing) a location where she may engage clients. A woman who runs a brothel is known as a madam rather than a pimp.Pimps may punish johns for physical abuse or failure to pay and enforce exclusive rights to 'turf' where their prostitutes may advertise and operate with less competition.The pimp-prostitute relationship can be abusive and possessive, with the pimp / madam using techniques such as psychological intimidation, manipulation, starvation, rape and/or gang rape, beating, confinement, threats of violence toward the victimâ<U+0080><U+0099>s family, forced drug use and the shame from these acts.

1514	lyvyathan	2012-04-12	Hi, thanks for putting the topic back on track while it keeps going astray for pages about whether or not Littlefinger is a pedophile or sexual predator. That's all later in the books / series dealing with Sansa and I'm sure there will be exhaustingly long debates raging over how inappropriate or wrong it all is. In fact, i'm curious whether they'll even allow a kiss between the actors for LF and Sansa considering how touchy most are watching anything pedo related.

Really? And folks here continue to defend it and the producers opinion of its importance? Whatever.Thanks for your compliment.Funnily enough - i also liked Ros in Season 1 - she was like a void where the actors could perform a soliloquy.Season 2, I find her presence grating. It wouldn't be so much of an issue actually if HBO GoT was a long running weekly show like "CSI" or "LOST" - but they've got what? 12 episodes only? correct me if I'm wrong. So you would expect HBO to cramp as much plot into each story so that the audience (non-readers especially) aren't confused what the heck is going on and ask - who is Stennis again?I get that they want to titilate the audience - but there has to be a better way than portraying LF as a low-life pimp which he isn't - and this really detracts from the essense of his character - he really was a devious smart devil - so smart that he also fooled Tyrion. Of all the people in the epic - he was the one who bears a large responsiblity for starting the Stark-Lannister war and for the needless slaughter which eventuated. You'd think he has better things to do with his time than to have heart-to heart sessions with his top girl.So yeah I really think they made an error of judgement in the LF/Ros additions. Well, would they listen?

So you get a feeling that HBO decided to draw teeth and legs onto the snake rather than to paint its color.Added scenes do help - I believe it too - one of my all time fav scenes is in Season 1 where Robert explains to Cersei why he is concerned from Dany's marriage to the Horselord and why she is such a big threat to the 7 Kingdoms. Don't you love it when Mark Addy punches his fist and says that awesome line of his? And how they had that moment when they talked about how their marriage was the only thing that was holding up the Kingdom? That was sheer brilliance.
1516	lyvyathan	2012-04-12	I don't know what kind of "definition" you found that seems to make you believe that the only way we could classify LF as a sexual predator is if he outright has sex with Sansa.Why, it would be his definition or what he thinks it is. And that's the only thing that matters /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />BTW, have you seen a pink elephant?
1517	lyvyathan	2012-04-12	What's troubling to me is the blatant dismissal of textual evidence which shows how the man is grooming Sansa and beginning a pattern of abuse that will in all likelihood escalate. What does this mean for the real world when some of us can't even recognize the signs of sexual abuse. When a grown man is using his power to make a young girl sit on his lap, taking kisses from her under the guise of being "daddy" and we still can't recognize that person as a sexual predator. It's honestly scary.Why are you surprised when so many posters don't have a problem with a character showing coldness and hostility to her husband's child living in her household for 15 years? /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />

1518	lyvyathan	2012-04-12	Also, I had forgotten Littlefinger's part in the Jeyne as Arya switcheroo plot. It's never detailed explicitly in the books but its quite possibly another area Littlefinger's slimy methods coerced someone into doing something against their will. I always did wonder where she vanished to all that time between the time she was taken from Sansa's room until the time she turns up as the fake Arya heading to Winterfell and a Bolton wedding.See that's what I wanted to see - LF's role in "brainwashing" Jeyne to become "Arya". The book didn't give too much details about it - I think there was a mention that she was stashed by LF "somewhere" and then she strangely reappears complient as "Arya" and takes her role so seriously she calls out to Theon as "Arya" and talks to him at some length.If HBO wanted to show the shitty side of LF's character they could have shown us how he was "remoulding" Jeyne - who was terrified, scared and just as deluded as (Book 1) Sansa was. ie taking her to see how girls as young as she was were being expolited in his brothels.

1519	Lord Varys	2012-04-12	Well, okay, technically Littlefinger might be a pimp. But, well, he is a pimp in a stockholder sense. He owns shares and shares and shares of many enterprises, including brothels. I'm not sure if we would call a man 'a baker' if he happened to own many enterprises, including a bakery. Littlefinger is also a shipowner (he at least owns the Merling King, the ship he uses to travel to the Vale in ASoS), but I guess we do all agree he is not defined by the fact that he owns ships.
So breaking Littlefinger down to the core-personality of 'the pimp' is just wrong.
1520	brashcandy	2012-04-12	Why are you surprised when so many posters don't have a problem with a character showing coldness and hostility to her husband's child living in her household for 15 years? /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />Hahaha!

1521	A Bong of Ice and Fire	2012-04-12	I must say that, while I've actually enjoyed LF's scenes this season, I feel they are a bit out of character. Not as much as some here seem to think... but enough that I notice it and think there was something that wasn't quite right in the scene. I understand LF being in his brothels, I always assumed that these whores were more than a purely monetary investment, these brothels are probably a rather important source of information for him (like Doreah said: men like to talk when they are happy). What I don't understand is why he would openly threaten Ros like that if she is indeed the overseer of this brothel, just like I don't think he would ever openly have threatened Cersei like he did in the first episode. Basically all of LF's schemes are based on people seeing him as a friend or dismissing him as a threat! Oh, well, I'll wait for a few more episodes to make my final judgement... I still love Aidan Gillen as Littlefinger, though...Don't apologize for the way HBO is destroying the Littlefinger character.   His actions in Season 2 are not "a bit out of character"; they are COMPLETELY out of character.  In fact, TV LF is a totally different character from book LF now.This makes me sick.  I don't mind when the show adds additional not-in-the-books scenes or characters to help give us necessary background information from the books.  But HBO has NO RIGHT to make fundamental changes to the characters of the books'.. well, characters.Season 1 was good because it didn't deviate too much from the books' plots and characterizations.  (Also it was good because it had 2 very good actors in key roles - Sean Bean & Mark Addy.  Season 2 has no such appealing actors, in my opinion.)But season 2 is doing WAY too much "interpretation" of the books' characters and making too many major changes.  F that.  This show has jumped the shark and will just get worse from here on.

1522	Serc	2012-04-12	Perhaps I'm alone in this, but I thought this was foreshadowing for a certain Frankengregor/Qyburn."A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men."I thought that was the point. The books are very subtle about Qyburn working on Gregor until he's blatantly revealed.
1523	Lord Varys	2012-04-12	I don't see a connection to Qyburn here. That is, as long as they are going to mess completely with Qyburn's character in the series:
1. Qyburn is not wealthy.
2. Qyburn is a disgraced maester serving with the Brave Companions. He most likely never was in KL before he arrived there in ASoS, nor is it implied that he has connections to influential people before he starts hanging with powerful people before he hangs out with Cersei.
3. It was already implied back in season 1 that some of the patrons of Littlefinger's brothels have strange desires. In my opinion, the Lysene girl ended up with 'the certain lord' who has a thing for fresh cadavers. Or with the Tumblestone knight, who likey amputees.

Or with the Tumblestone knight, who likey amputees.Alternatively he could be referencing Ramsay Snow Bolton. Reading through most of the posts, I have come to the conclusion that the scene was pretty much ok and it showcased LF's ability to "bait the dog" if you like with his false comfort (example: building the snow castle with Sansa in ASOS was kind of cute before he revealed his true intentions). And I have read a couple of reviews from those who have seen the first four episodes, one on this very site in fact, and they say that LF is wonderful in episode 4, so give the series a chance /happy.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='^_^' />
1525	Envie	2012-04-12	Qyburn is a disgraced maester serving with the Brave Companions. He most likely never was in KL before he arrived there in ASoS, nor is it implied that he has connections to influential people before he starts hanging with powerful people before he hangs out with Cersei.But who did Qyburn serve before he was exiled? You're forgetting the sequence of events. It's likely Littlefinger already knows Qyburn and his particular 'tastes' for live victims to do his experiments on from the past. I'm not saying Qyburn is the exact patron he's referring to when he's talking to Ros about the girl from Lys because I don't think he is -  but as others have said, Littlefinger's already, on numerous occasions (by Varys mostly) been outed for his willingness to cater to exotic requests in his brothels.I would also point out the difference here (to me):1. LF is amoral when it comes to how his employee whores are used as he's willing to hire out girls for sexually deviant patrons but this does not necessarily label him a sexual predator himself.2. Littlefinger's future role with Sansa and his particular 'desires' would label him a 'sexual predator' as others are so fond of pointing out.Of coures, these are both important in the list of reasons why he's despicable and slimy. BUT -  I still think the two arguments are completely separate in this thread of debates.My argument, started at my original post, is that thus far, we've already been shown (through arguments with Varys as well as other exposition scenes) just how vile Petyr Baelish can be. The scene with his threats to Ros and the revealing of 'scary' things done to another whore who refused to be happy and work wasn't necessary for that, nor does it indicate any sort of predetermined pedophile-behavior-to-come with Sansa in the future.Your point (and others who have stated it) does have merit: there's a possible trigger here to indicate that Littlefinger's past caterings play a significant part in future caterings as well. He's clearly willing to do it.I too would have much rather seen him having Jeyne  'trained' for her future role as the Arya bride to Bolton - but given she too is just a young girl, I'm going to assume the producers feel that's a no-no area modern viewers are very sensitive about. Apparently consensual sex between siblings is ok to film, but anything sexual or even implying sex between an adult and child would not. Although, as I type this, I'm reminded of how young Daenerys was when she was married to Khal Drogo too - but of course in the series they made her an adult... or did they? There's a fine line between what is consensual and forced. I don't think the 'training' of a noble girl in a whorehouse whose been taken prisoner there would be agreeable.
1526	Envie	2012-04-12	Well, okay, technically Littlefinger might be a pimp. But, well, he is a pimp in a stockholder sense. He owns shares and shares and shares of many enterprises, including brothels. I'm not sure if we would call a man 'a baker' if he happened to own many enterprises, including a bakery. Littlefinger is also a shipowner (he at least owns the Merling King, the ship he uses to travel to the Vale in ASoS), but I guess we do all agree he is not defined by the fact that he owns ships.So breaking Littlefinger down to the core-personality of 'the pimp' is just wrong.Well I've always agreed with your outlook on it as well. Everyone wants to argue "but a pimp IS a businessman" when I tried to point out that Baelish is an investor, a businessman, not a pimp (at least from the way he was written in the books). He owned ships but wasn't called a "captain" was he? Why is it that he owns brothels but is a "pimp" because HBO decided to make him one? It's a little piddly argument but the implication is big when its interpreted into the role. They clearly wanted the 'sex' drama role adding him as a pimp would bring. For many it works and is juicy fun stuff. For others it seems out of character. To each his own.In the books, although yes LF does in fact take Catelyn to one of his brothels to have her meet with Ned, there's never any indication that he spends a lot of his time there or that he takes a hand in its management the way he does in the show.In the show, he's very hands on, to the point of wiping semen off the mouth of a whore as she walks out of a room? No, I'm sorry but I'm not buying the way they're portraying Petyr Baelish in the show. The actor does a fantastic job in other areas, particularly small council, Varys and Ned Stark scenes... he's spot on. The 'pimp' scenes are just not jiving with that.

The 'pimp' scenes are just not jiving with that.As I noted elsewhere in this thread, the TV Petyr is simply a different guy:  he's not as smart, not as self-discliplined and - apropos to your point - is an actual pimp (addressing customer complaints, hiring girls, managing employees) as opposed to an investor who owns several brothels as part of a diversified investment portfolio.  After being upset about it initially I've just come to accept that they are making different choices for the character on the show.
1528	Envie	2012-04-12	I've just come to accept that they are making different choices for the character on the show.Me too. I accept that they have chosen to portray Littlefinger this way in the show. My disagreement only resurfaces when people insist that the show Littlefinger is the way he was in the books in regards to the 'pimp' definition which bugs me and because people seem to think the scene with Ros was so necessary or important for some reason which I still don't agree it was. Those I've just quoted previously were in agreement and I liked what they had to say.I did say I was done debating it but I just can't stop myself haha!

I even posted it for review in my earlier post. I do find posts like yours amusing though, for obvious reasons.

1530	A Bong of Ice and Fire	2012-04-12	I accept that they have chosen to portray Littlefinger this way in the show.I don't accept their completely changing the Littlefinger character and calling the series "Game of Thrones".  We were led to believe that we were getting A Song of Ice and Fire transferred from books to TV. What we are getting instead is a TV drama "inspired by the books of A Song of Ice and Fire", with the producers' own interpretations of the characters and their motives.Too bad.  I don't want some TV producers' "improvements" over GRRM's work.  No need to defend the insulting changes they are making.
1531	Tre	2012-04-12	cool, but youve gone off the page.......   none of you look at , or have thought about condensing 1000 plus pages into circa 2 minutes of screen time to explain the whole lot of abuse and violence there is in the time this great piece of novel is set. 
LF, in my way of seeing it, tells the story of Tyrions wife,   there is loads of connections to this, both in the books and in series 1 of the tv series. This is connected to the hatred and betrayal/revenge that ultimately makes compelling viewing and makes us discuss these points. 
Whilst I agree with your points, I look at this as a forum.   comments please
1532	Envie	2012-04-12	I don't accept their completely changing the Littlefinger character and calling the series "Game of Thrones".

I don't want some TV producers' "improvements" over GRRM's work.  No need to defend the insulting changes they are making.I'm not defending the changes, but plenty of people are and seem to think its fine to take liberties with the characters and to change/add things via a different interpretation. Here's my question: How much say or input does GRRM have on the script and story writing other than the episode he himself is noted to have produced? Does he get to yay or nay things and if so, does that mean he's given the nod of approval for changes to the story? I'm assuming major plot changes (such as the way this episode's cliffhanger ending played) would likely have been run by him to see if they work with future episodes and keep the story generally moving in the right direction.Does a film adaptation have to follow the books exactly to the letter? No. I don't believe it does and with an epic 5000+ page story like this one, would be impossible anyways. Do all the characters have to look exactly like their description in the book and act out their parts exactly to the letter as written? No, again, I don't expect exact replication and probably no one is going to be that unreasonable no matter how huge of a book fan they are.There have been a lot of changes to various characters as well as the plot thus far in the first two seasons and I'm quite sure there will be many more in the seasons to come since HBO has already approved season 3 (yay).I'm actually ok with Littlefinger's character portrayal for the most part. I think they went a little overboard with the whole 'pimp' thing, especially with the famous scene of Ros and her job interview last season as well as this one with her bawling about the dead baby Barra and Littlefinger turning into evil cartoon overlord whispering in her ear. But mostly I really like the way the actor is portraying him and think its fairly true to his personality overall minus the brothel junk but for many that's just personal preference.
1533	Tre	2012-04-12	Cool, :like the way you summarised the whole now filmed everytime we walk out side, every call we make, our IP adresses etc, it happenes in GOT through Varys and his "Little birds" and by LF (Banks) . A great insight..
1534	Lord Varys	2012-04-12	The problem with this particular scene is not only the distortion of Littlefinger's character (Why show him at the brothel again and again? What are they intending to do with him when he becomes Lord Protector of the Vale? Give us 'sexposition' scenes with him, Mord, Lysa, Lyn Corbray, and Ros?), it just leads to nowhere. So Ros is said about Barra. I don't care. I don't care at all about Ros as a character. If this was supposed to shed some additional light on Petyr's character it failed spectacularly. We already knew that he is an ass. And he will not use that particular approach to any women he interacts with later on during the series. Not with Catelyn. Not with Lysa. And most certainly not with Sansa!
So what do we know now? Littlefinger can keep his whores in line with scary stories. Great. Did we need to know this? No. Does this surprise us? No. Why not? Because any pimp knows how to keep his whores in line, else he would not be a pimp.
And just for the record: I don't approve of most of the changes they made to the characters. Especially the distorted versions of Catelyn and Cersei. The series is an adaptation not an interpretation. And since GRRM's work consists mostly of greatly written characters, distorting them will always backfire, since it will also distort the motivations of the characters and thus eventually the story that is told.
1535	weirwood woman	2012-04-12	And I don't find myself feeling any sympathy toward Ros because she sniffled a bit. How are we to know they were real tears anyway? We've not seen much compassion in her before, so I remain unconvinced/uncaringThat was my first impression of the scene too...it just seemed out of character for her to be crying like that and not to say that whores cant express emotions but to have her do so in front of the boss was stupid IMO. Her character would have more sense than to display any 'weakness' that would jeopardise her new status in the brothel. Apart from the whole scene irritating me, I was put off especially by the crying more so than the veiled threat from LF. And the other cringe worthy moment of course (yuk yuk yuk)
1536	brashcandy	2012-04-12	The problem with this particular scene is not only the distortion of Littlefinger's character (Why show him at the brothel again and again?

We already knew that he is an ass. And he will not use that particular approach to any women he interacts with later on during the series. Not with Catelyn. Not with Lysa. And most certainly not with Sansa!The man's brothels are in KL. They want to reveal a particularly nasty side to his character, so why not have it in this setting? We've seen his "public" court face of playing the game, and now we're seeing his private face. Both faces - Petyr Baelish (court official) and Littlefinger (pimp and sexual predator) are equally vile and untrustworthy. Don't you think that it's fairly realistic that we are shown some aftermath of the terrible killing of the infant in the brothel? Don't you think that it's realistic that LF would want to go check on his establishment after such an incident? Making sure that business was running as usual? This is why we see him peeping through the keyhole, appeasing the disgruntled client and threatening Ros. He's being a smart businessman and making sure that there are no loose ends. I think this is keeping perfectly in line with book LF. And yes, for all we know we might see some brothel scenes in the Vale. It wouldn't surprise me to learn that LF has businesses in Gulltown too.As for not using the same approach with Cat, Lysa and Sansa, are you being serious? I can't locate my AFFC at the moment, but there's a part in a Sansa chapter there where she notes about the man's two sides, LF and Petyr, and how she doesn't like the former. There's a time when she doesn't kiss him like he wanted - I think she gives him a quick peck on the cheek and he responds with "how dutiful" and later takes the one he wanted. Poor Lysa learnt about his untrustworthiness too late, as it happened when he pushing her through a moon door. Cat still believes he is the nice hometown boy she knew at Riverrun, and takes his word that the dagger belonged to Tyrion.So what do we know now? Littlefinger can keep his whores in line with scary stories. Great. Did we need to know this? No. Does this surprise us? No. Why not? Because any pimp knows how to keep his whores in line, else he would not be a pimp.Sigh. It may not be surprising to you, but there are many tv viewers who might have found it enlightening. I've said time and again that it was meant to further establish a point about LF's character. He's a villain, not just at court where you could argue everyone has to play the game; but he doesn't even have any redeeming characteristics when it comes to his personal operations. A baby has been murdered in his brothel, and all he's worried about is whether or not Ros will make him money. That tells me a lot more about LF than the impression of season 1 that he's simply a good game player.

He didn't do this by asking her nicely and saying pretty please and offering her all the lemon cakes she wanted.  There is a lot of textual evidence to support that Jeyne Poole becoming fake Arya was not a happy transformation at all.  If they use this particular storyline, then yeah, viewers do need to know that he doesn't use his brothels as a place to hide Catelyn or to ruminate aloud with his whores. It's sort of ironic because I wasn't completely on board with this particular scene when I first saw it but the more I read about the reasons why other people thought it was crap, the more I realize how useful this scene will be for future story lines.

You can google youtube for it. Its the one where he acts as the mediator for the actors of Season 1.I don't think many readers would get upset over minor changes - but when HBO starts drifting towards major character changes for no apparent gain other than to show some female nudity and sex - then the readers have a good reason to be unhappy. Its like all the brouhaha over the changes in plot in the Star Wars prequels, midi-wtf-chlorians and that infamous re-edited scene where Greedo inexplicably shoots first.The problem about dumbing down LF is that it makes it a little bit more harder for the audience to realize his sheer genius in scheming and masterminding the entire Lannister vs Stark conflict - in order to position himself from a humble Lord to a major player.

At some point they have to introduce Jeyne - why not now?

Meanwhile you would assume that the Master of the Coin would have better things to do with his time than micromanaging/  the daily running of his whore house.
1542	lyvyathan	2012-04-13	Well I've always agreed with your outlook on it as well. Everyone wants to argue "but a pimp IS a businessman" when I tried to point out that Baelish is an investor, a businessman, not a pimp (at least from the way he was written in the books). He owned ships but wasn't called a "captain" was he? Why is it that he owns brothels but is a "pimp" because HBO decided to make him one?Well, he would be called a ship magnate then! A pimp is often used as a derogatory term for people who profits directly from the revenue of prostitutes. Of course LF is more than just a pimp - but readers would associate him with a pimp because of his noxious character.
1543	Balefont	2012-04-13	LF, in my way of seeing it, tells the story of Tyrions wife,   there is loads of connections to this, both in the books and in series 1 of the tv series.Please explain why you think this.

Meanwhile you would assume that the Master of the Coin would have better things to do with his time than micromanaging/ the daily running of his whore house.Yes I agree, but perhaps we're not meant to be shown Jeyne's "training" at all. Maybe it will only be alluded to, with the scene with Ros standing as evidence of what LF is capable of.
1545	Strider	2012-04-13	It is clear that the HBO writers will be making significant changes to the story and characters.  Is this a problem?  Only for those who are deeply invested in the books.  I remember the uproar that occurred when Faramir made his appearance in the Two Towers.  I hardly recognized him and was pretty upset the changes.  But eventually I was able to separate the books from the movies in my mind and begin to appreciate the movies on their own terms.  And that is what must happen with all of us.
Martin's books are unadaptable for TV.  Period.  Here we are complaining about a couple of scenes involving HBO-Littlefinger.   But one of the huge problems here is is that the Littlefinger that we know is the one who has been revealed in five books and much of his character development occurs after he has "kidnapped" Sansa.  The TV writers, though, do not have the luxury of waiting to develop his character until seasons 3 & 4, and so they have chosen to reveal him through his profession as pimp.  Why not?  This is his profession.  He is the successful proprietor of high class brothels.  Though undeveloped in the books, this is a feature of LF's life that is ripe for imaginative reflection and reconstruction.  It is not tangential to who he is.  He may be more but he is not less than a pimp. Women (and people) are "investments," objects to be used to advance his purposes.   
The only way we who love the books will be able to enjoy the HBO show is to let go of our expectations.  The HBO writers are using the Martin source material, but they are making changes and will continue to make changes.  They need to do so if the show is to flourish.  It's a damn good show, folks.    Enjoy it on its own terms.
1546	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-13	OK - but don't you't you think it would be better serve to have the actual Jeyne take the tour of horror with LF rather than more airtime for non-canon character like Ros?

My guess is that if they use the fake Arya storyline, Ros will be the one who plays a major part in it since she spent so many years in Winterfell.
1547	Balefont	2012-04-13	It is clear that the HBO writers will be making significant changes to the story and characters.  Is this a problem?  Only for those who are deeply invested in the books.I disagree because some of these are relatively drastic changes in character nature.  Character nature that is the backbone behind why characters say and do certain things in the future.  The concern I have is the ripple effect that many of these alterations will have on the future story lines.And I'm sick of Ros being the cumbucket, literally and figuratively, for Littlefinger's character.
1548	Envie	2012-04-13	I don't think they are going to use Jeyne Poole even if they use the fake Arya storyline.  It isn't a character that has been cast.  My guess is that if they use the fake Arya storyline, Ros will be the one who plays a major part in it since she spent so many years in Winterfell.Why do people keep thinking Ros as the 'fake Arya' is an even remotely plausible possibility? It's a horrible idea! There is no way in seven hells they're going to convince an audience (let alone the Boltons) that Ros, a full grown very mature looking voluptuous woman is a 12 year old little girl!! The producers would never try something that ridiculous no matter how many other strange changes they've made.
1549	Lord Varys	2012-04-13	Jeyne Pool was in the series, as was her father. And she was even mentioned in episode 4, so I don't see any problem here. If Ros would end up being 'Arya Stark' the whole North would deserve to be flayed alive by Ramsay Bolton for stupidity. Along with the producers of the show who came up with that crappy idea.

Along with the producers of the show who came up with that crappy idea.There's a snapshot from the feast at Winterfell when the royal family came up there in season one floating around somewhere. It shows Sansa whispering to a smaller, dark haired girl who most of us assume is Jeyne Poole. She looks remarkably like an older Arya by a few years. If they cast that actress as Jeyne, the whole issue is solved.
1551	Skeksi	2012-04-13	My thoughts on this scene:
- Better than the scene in the first episode with him and Cersei, which made him look quite stupid. Being more concerned about his personal profit than the reason Ros is upset is not out of character for Littlefinger, IMO. I have a little doubt that LF is going to confess his life story to this woman, leave her in charge of the brothels (and presumably some spying that goes on there) and then threaten her so obviously- as people have said, LF tends to get his way by making people trust him- but I can just about overlook that aspect.
My main issue with this scene stems from the fact that Littlefinger-as-only-a-pimp is kind of becoming more overt. Yes, he owns brothels, and yes, he hides Cat in one. He also invests in many other businesses, he has installed men loyal to him in several roles in King's Landing, he buys and sells at a profit- he is extraordinarily financially capable, which is WHY he is the Master of Coin (and not only does it explain why he was brought in to do this job, despite his low birth, it also serves to give us more evidence that Littlefinger is very clever and capable). Otherwise, he's just a man who got rich owning brothels, which doesn't take a huge amount of financial acumen. Now, I understand that in the books, we mostly heard about these through the eyes of other characters, such as Tyrion, however, in the books, we also don't have him appearing at the brothel every other scene- not to mention, auditioning prostitutes, dealing with customer complaints, etc, which he surely wouldn't have the time to do. We have seen nothing of his other activities, despite the fact that, if they wanted to expand Littlefinger's character, they could quite easily have shown him selling positions, etc.
I doubt anyone here who doesn't think the scene is entirely fitting with LF's character isn't doing it because they think Petyr Baelish is really a morally upright righteous dude. I think it's the WAY his evilness, if you like, is portrayed that I think presents an issue. He is meant to be not only a skilled player of the Game of Thrones/ manipulator of people (which got knocked last episode by him threatening Cersei), but also very skilled with finances and various investments (and is instead coming across as someone who got rich through just one enterprise).
I'm not sure WHY they can't seem to get the LF scenes right this season. I don't know if it's that they're trying to add in extra stuff for him to do, because he is a major character, but aren't really sure how to go about it, or if they've just decided they can't do without extra nudity and have decided that Littlefinger is an easy ticket in that direction. I really hope it's not the latter, as they've written him pretty well in the past, IMO, and one hopes that when his main arc of the season kicks off (which will presumably be negotiating with Renly/ the Tyrells), they'll right themselves again.

I said Ros may play a part in training fake Arya.  Considering we saw Ros training whores last week, it's not a huge stretch to think Ros, who knows a whole lot about Winterfell, could play a part in the training.  As far as we have seen in the show, Jeyne was never in KL and even the two scenes she was in, the viewers have no idea who she is.  She was basically a silent extra.  Maybe they will cast and use Jeyne Poole (if they go that route), but if they don't, they have Ros around to help....with the training.

1555	Lord of Cheese	2012-04-14	LOL... i dont think we need to devote precious minutes of the series to develop a character whose ultimate purpose will be to train Jeyne how to pleasure.
Ros does not fit anywhere and its madness she is there at all.
1556	TC_Chaos	2012-04-14	Ros is undoubtedly the most hated character on this forum, LOL. But I know when they kill her off, everyone will want to see more of her nudity.
1557	lyvyathan	2012-04-14	Yes I agree, but perhaps we're not meant to be shown Jeyne's "training" at all. Maybe it will only be alluded to, with the scene with Ros standing as evidence of what LF is capable of.But it doesn't make sense to use a non-canonical character when there are suitable canonical characters to use. I can understand deviations from the story such as the (impression) conversation between Cersei and Robert about the threat posed by that "Targaryen girl".This one is a bit hard to justify imho.I wouldn't object if the series was going to go for 20 - 24+ episodes like CSI or LOST - but considering its only running for 12episodes throwing sizable (HBO inspired) scenes for Ros and LF is exasperating for me.
1558	lyvyathan	2012-04-14	Ok, my mistake then.

The only reason why I think we're getting more brothel time is because GRRM wants to see more of Ros' snatch. Its one thing to write about beautiful naked women - its quite another to see them in person. I bet he's having the time of his life now.
1560	Envie	2012-04-14	Ros is undoubtedly the most hated character on this forum, LOL. But I know when they kill her off, everyone will want to see more of her nudity.I want to clarify that I'm in no way a 'book purist' , nor did I start this thread because I hate Ros being added to the show and given so much screen time. There's plenty of people have voiced their dislike for her in this thread and last season too. I actually liked Ros last season. I felt her saucy attitude with Tyrion about him being the "Imp" and her feisty comeback to Theon when he said he didn't want to pay for it ("then get a wife") were great. I even liked the scene with Pycelle even though most didn't (personally I think people were turned off by an old man doing squats in a sheer nightshirt haha). The actress is very cute and plays her part perfectly. At first I wasn't sure about the brothel / Littlefinger scene in season 1 but the story LF tells is important and sexposition has been useful in the show.My problem this season has been her quick rise to prominence as apparently the 'manager' of the brothel as well as the large amount of screen time the brothel scenes have gotten and nothing else. It feels like the producers liked the 'shock' effect the sexposition / brothel scene last season had and tried to go for again this season but its falling short and doesn't feel as important or flow with the story at all since they've now veered so far off the book storyline. None of that happened because Ros didn't exist in the book. I guess if that does ultimately make me a book purist then ok, I've reasoned out my own disclaimer. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />

But in Season 2, it went a bit awry. GRRM should have garumped about it - but maybe he enjoys seeing the actress playing Ros too much - to complain.
1563	HyacinthGirl	2012-04-15	I didn't really mind it, actually. I minded the unnecessary lip-wiping before it. Most of the brothel scenes are just way too over the top. At least Ros had her clothes on in this scene.
As for the purpose of Ros, I've been saying for ages, that she'll replace Alayaya. It is known. At least, she'd better be, or we'll have wasted all this time on her whoring her way down from Winterfell to KL for basically no reason at all.

1564	Eichenlaub	2012-04-19	I hate Ros but... I admit this scene ha changed my opinion to a degree. I now think that all her pre kings landing scenes were useless, the epic Littlefinger exposition scene was bad, but mostly i think her character is a good addition to the story. Mostly i think her scenes could be written better because Littlefinger is too intelligent to speak so openly to her. Plus the gross out stuff is as mature as having fart gags in the show. If they let her keep her clothes on for one or two more episodes I'll become a Ros acceptor maybe lover
1565	Griffinz	2012-04-25	Sure it's a money saving device/space filler but arguably it worked as a counterpoint to Tyrion's next scene, the emotional arc of each being mirror images.
LF appears to be sympathetic and then his inhumanity is revealed with Ros, and in the very next scene Tyrion is chummy with the Guard Captain dude and then unveils the opposite morality.
Sure we know that LF is not a nice guy and Tyrion is a good guy but by putting their slipperyness and opposite morality side by side concerning the same matter their qualities are magnified.
I dunno, maybe? /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
1566	Masamune	2012-07-21	Because we need to shoehorn more screentime for Aidan Gillen and show what a Snidely Whiplash he is. I hate, hate, HATE what they've done with this character and I don't understand how Gillen has suddenly forgotten how to act, as well. For me, Littlefinger should have been more of an insidious evil in the show, a wild card like Varys. But instead he's just a stock villain who might as well stand there twiddling his mustache in all the scenes he's in.
1567	Ser Dermett Corbray	2012-04-10	So what did everyone think of this? I understand the need to cut out minor characters (of which Jacelyn Bywater is probably classed) but it seemed a bit odd how Bronn went from scruffy mercenary to arguably one of the cities most key figures instantly. Hard to imagine that the city watch would accept Bronn as their leader like that.
It was his gradual rise from Tyrion's bodyguard to de facto captain of his band of guards to knight to minor lord (just finished AFFC) in the book that made Bronn such a cool character. They've pretty much catapulted him to the top of a tree without much reasoning.
Ironhand Bywater was an astute choice because not only did Tyrion give himself one more key friend within the city but it showed that it wasn't all about making allies; Bywater was a city watch veteran and had earned the respect of his colleagues. In the book, Tyrion was showing that he could be a fair and just leader and not like his sister in promoting only his friends and lickspittles.
Of all the changes so far, this minor one bothers me the most.
1568	boojam	2012-04-12	I wondered will Bronn get a new uniform?
How long will he stay commander of the City Watch?
Anyone else note the disappointment on Tyrion's face for the answer Bronn gave to the question posed to him?
1569	Greywolf2375	2012-04-12	Anyone else note the disappointment on Tyrion's face for the answer Bronn gave to the question posed to him?I think that is the first inkling he gets that Bronn is really all about Bronn.  Previously he knew he was a merc of course, but there were some lines he thought wouldn't be crossed.  This is the first time he sees a Bronn in the light that ends up (bookwise) poorly for Tyrion.  Who knows what will happen here.It would be rather odd for Tyrion to ask Bronn now to fight for him later on.
1570	sarah.jenice	2012-04-12	It honestly didn't bother me at all. I really like the actor that plays Bronn, and I think it was a very reasonable decision to not have to introduce a new actor for that role. People I know that haven't read the books are having trouble following all of the new faces as is.
1571	Mr. E	2012-04-12	I think that is the first inkling he gets that Bronn is really all about Bronn.

Who knows what will happen here.It would be rather odd for Tyrion to ask Bronn now to fight for him later on.I agree, I really like that scene, and as someone pointed out in another thread, it really shows Tyrion's hypocrisy. He acts like he's taking some moral stance but at the end of the scene it's like he realizes that he's replaced a baby-killer with a slightly gruffer baby-killer who has the marked difference of being on Tyrion's side.
1572	Victaerys Ironfist	2012-04-12	Seeing how Jacelyn was got rid of after Blackwater (can't remember if he fled or was killed) I expect when Tywin comes back in Season 3, one of his first actions will be getting rid of Bronn as Commander, so I don't see this change disrupting or changingthe big picture to much.
1573	Lord Varys	2012-04-12	Bywater was killed by his own men during the Battle of the Blackwater. I guess Tywin will fire Bronn while Tyrion is between life and death, just as Tywin got rid of all of Tyrion's people during this time in the books. Since they decided to cut Ser Jacelyn, making Bronn the Lord Commander of the City Watch was the logical decision. I've no problem with that.
1574	Jamie Lannister	2012-04-12	I thought it was logical too. Tyrion wanted to get rid of Slynt and put one of his own creatures in charge, and who better than perhaps the most loyal (ostensibly) person in your direct employ to take up the mantle?
For Bronn, it probably comes off as "knowing the right people." Serving as the top enforcer to the King's Hand certainly helped move him up the ladder.
1575	Ser Sweets	2012-04-12	One of the changes the adaptation made which I like, though it does call question to the differentiation between book Tyrion and show Tyrion's natures.
1576	Jojen	2012-04-12	I think that is the first inkling he gets that Bronn is really all about Bronn.But Tryion's supposed to be a good judge of character. You'd think he'd have known Bronn's answer without needing to ask him first. Unless the point of the scene was to take Tyrion's confidence down a peg and show that even he, one of the most intelligent men in the series, can make mistakes.

1578	Iron Captain	2012-04-12	I didn't like the change either, only because I think it takes away from the moves made by Bronn in the book.  He went from sellsword, to sworn (sell)sword of an important lord, to knight, to husband of a noble lady, to minor lord himself.
In a way Bronn played his own game of thrones quite well, and this upjump to commander of the city watch doesn't fit into the sequence of how things happened in the books (I don't think him getting knighted to "Ser Bronn of the Blackwater" will mean as much now).
And most importantly, i'm quite worried he will take Ser Bywater's place on the blackwater, and they will kill his character during the battle.  Bronn still has his part to play in the books, but I could see the TV show cutting it out (as it isn't central to the story).  I don't want the TV show to kill him off, which I think is a realistic possibility.

1579	Buckwheat	2012-04-12	I thought it was a good change, also it amused me greatly. The look on Tyrion's face after Bronn answers him is also very good.
1580	Ferrum Aeternum	2012-04-12	I found it to be a nice unexpected coup de grace to a very entertaining and well-played scene.  The logistics should work themselves out one way or another.  He'll still end up being Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.  I don't see the logic in Bronn's story overlapping with Ser Jacelyn's either.  Wouldn't make much sense to kill him off at this point, as his interactions with Tyrion in ASOS will make for great TV.

More like taking charge (and therefore, responsibility).For all his flaws, Tyrion isn't likely to order the killing of babies.
1584	Ser Reptitious	2012-04-12	Could be the first instance of the TV show killing off a character who wasn't killed in the book.Not really. Drogo already killed one of his bloodriders (name escapes me at the moment) in the first season who remained very much alive in the books. Also, Rakharo just got himself killed this past episode and he's still around in the books.
1585	Iron Captain	2012-04-12	Not really. Drogo already killed one of his bloodriders (name escapes me at the moment) in the first season who remained very much alive in the books. Also, Rakharo just got himself killed this past episode and he's still around in the books.I think those deaths are a little different.  Drogo killed Mago, a ko not a bloodrider.And 'Rakharo' was pretty much Jhogo from the books, although the death is different I read that they cast somebody else to play the all-rolled-into-one bloodrider that 'Rakharo' played in the first season.  You're technically right in that it's a change from the books, but those were more or less throwaway characters (in the way they used them in the first season), Bronn isn't.
1586	Lord of Brewtown	2012-04-12	I'm fine with how they merged Bywater into Bronn for the show.  Gives Bronn more to do/reason to be on screen, and is a sensible cut.  For me that doesn't affect much.  Also fine with how they seem to be merging Davos's son into several characters.  What I don't like is how they seem to be getting rid of Shireen, and possibly Jojen & Meera.  That's not necessary.  Even if you don't show Shireen, just mention her.  That changes the story too much for me.
1587	Envie	2012-04-12	This is one of the plot changes I'm ok with so far. I think they may be doing this for brevity in Bronn's story line because although he's an important side character in Tyrion's story arc, he isn't a lead character that would warrant a lot of extra scenes to play out his own rise to lordship with the limited screen time they have to work with this season. I think this promotion to captain of the watch will help television viewers see how quickly Bronn takes his own place in the game since later on when he breaks away from Tyrion with his own agenda, viewers will have already identified with his power play early on.

Following him around, being asked to hire the Kettleblacks to get some of Tyrion's men close to Cersei etc. Jumping a nobody (even if it's Bronn and he's awesome) to Commander of the city watch when there were veterans amongst the ranks (such as Ironhand) doesn't make much sense. Adding a few minor characters, no matter how short their stay, would have shown that Tyrion was trying to build something. Instead it's just him and Bronn ruling the roost. Meh.Oh and I reckon Shireen will come into it eventually. Perhaps when Davos starts taking reading lessons.
1589	Iron Captain	2012-04-12	Oh and I reckon Shireen will come into it eventually. Perhaps when Davos starts taking reading lessons.Didn't Mel tell Stannis that his wife had given him no children (vs sons), only stillborns?  Or did she say no sons, when I watched it it seemed to me that they completely eliminated the chance of having shireen.
1590	TeamDanyArya	2012-04-12	I'm fine with Bronn being in charge of the Goldcloaks. I can see it as being plausible because Tyrion needs someone in charge that he can trust, or trust about as much as he can. Bronn's honest which I think he respects. Plus, it sets up for more pissing contests between him, Cersei, and Joffery. And Bronn's a badass.
I'm okay with Shireen being eliminated. Melisandre made it clear that Selyse had not given Stannis any living children of either gender. Shireen is so very, very minor in the book. For the show, she'd serve no purpose whatsoever. Stannis has no sons which is true to the book.
1591	Prince of Dragonstone	2012-04-13	Makes more sense, storywise, to streamline characters like Bronn/Bywater because it's only 10 episodes and with a series this epic and chock-full of characters, every last minute of airtime counts. I'm also totally fine with getting rid of superfluous like Shireen because they aren't even that important to the story in the books so why add them to the TV series? Although, if they don't have Shireen then they probably won't have Edric Storm either which kind of sucks. I think Gendry is about all the "important Robert bastards" that the show will have unfortunately. Hopefully I'm proven wrong and they keep Edric.
1592	Fredwin	2012-04-13	This was one of the really good choices they made. The audience is already familiar with Bronn and what his character of capable of. So his new role is already set up with no explanation. Bronn can now be used in almost all the King's Landing scenes as an established presence. Whether it's keeping Joff in check, preparing the city defenses, or escorting Tyrion, etc.
1593	Fredwin	2012-04-13	I'm okay with Shireen being eliminated. Melisandre made it clear that Selyse had not given Stannis any living children of either gender. Shireen is so very, very minor in the book. For the show, she'd serve no purpose whatsoever. Stannis has no sons which is true to the book.Did she? I thought she said I'll give you a son. Your wife has given you only stillborns. She doesn't say a child, she says a son right? So It's still plausible he has a daughter?
1594	Holmes	2012-04-13	Problem:  Wasn't Slynt on the small council?  Ostensibly Bronn could take that seat, and that shit just ain't right (inasmuch as we all love the guy).
1595	Fredwin	2012-04-13	Problem:  Wasn't Slynt on the small council?  Ostensibly Bronn could take that seat, and that shit just ain't right (inasmuch as we all love the guy).Small council doesn't always meet in full. I recall meetings when Slynt wasn't there. Bronn could always stand at Tyrions side as usual. It would be weird though.
1596	TheCube	2012-04-13	Problem:  Wasn't Slynt on the small council?  Ostensibly Bronn could take that seat, and that shit just ain't right (inasmuch as we all love the guy).Slynt wasn't on the small council in his position as Lord Commander of the City Watch, it was because of the service he gave Cersei in the succession issue.As the small council position is not tied to the City Watch position there is no reason to assume his successor in the Watch would also succeed to the small council.
1597	Terminated	2012-04-13	I wonder whether, now that Bywater and Bronn merged, if that character will follow Bronn or Bywater's story.
As much as I like Bronn, my bet is on #2, meaning Bronn dies soon.  That way they don' t have to worry about squeezing the whole Stokeworth background in the show, cast Lolly, etc...  Which is fun but so far not very vital to the main plot(s).

That way they don' t have to worry about squeezing the whole Stokeworth background in the show, cast Lolly, etc...  Which is fun but so far not very vital to the main plot(s).I'd never considered this before, but it's an interesting possibility.That being said, if Bronn dies I might weep giant man-tears.
1599	Greywolf2375	2012-04-13	I wonder whether, now that Bywater and Bronn merged, if that character will follow Bronn or Bywater's story.As much as I like Bronn, my bet is on #2, meaning Bronn dies soon.  That way they don' t have to worry about squeezing the whole Stokeworth background in the show, cast Lolly, etc...  Which is fun but so far not very vital to the main plot(s).I don't think he will die - i think this is the jump in legitimacy that he got in the books via the Stokeworth marriage.  This allows the step up so that, if things continue close-ish to the books, he is still in a relatively able position to get further ahead without having to introduce additional characters.  We may hear about the outcome of the fiasco at the docks, but probably not see lollys, Tanda, etc.
1600	Fredwin	2012-04-13	I was just going to post that I didn't think he would die, but when Cersei regains control, there is no way she is going to keep him as the watch commander.
1601	Leuf	2012-04-13	I'd be shocked if Bronn doesn't die in the Blackwater.  He has no real purpose after this season.
While Mel does say "no living sons, only stillborns, only death" and you could parse that to not rule out a daughter, to say that and then never see his daughter this season and then *poof* there she is later would be BS.
1602	Fredwin	2012-04-13	I'd be shocked if Bronn doesn't die in the Blackwater.  He has no real purpose after this season.While Mel does say "no living sons, only stillborns, only death" and you could parse that to not rule out a daughter, to say that and then never see his daughter this season and then *poof* there she is later would be BS.The scene itself was fairly BS though. Stannis, newly introduced, never mentions he wants a son or anything to that effect. There wasn't enough of an introduction or backstory to really have this scene make a whole lot of sense. So, yeah, I think it will be contradictory and just well.. odd, if a daughter should pop up now. I still think we might see it happen though.
1603	Tewks44	2012-04-13	I don't even care at this point.  Season 1 was praised for following the book so closely and now the produces have pissed all over these compliments.  I'm not saying I condone it, but I'm over it in all honesty.  I'm just hoping season 2 won't turn into a total disaster at this point.
1604	The Greenseer	2012-04-13	Yeah it rubbed me wrong as well. However I do understand why limiting the characters will help the non book
viewers. I suppose it demonstrates the cronyism, and lack of Bronn's loyalty in one quick scene, without distorting any important outcomes.
1605	TC_Chaos	2012-04-14	I don't even care at this point.  Season 1 was praised for following the book so closely and now the produces have pissed all over these compliments.  I'm not saying I condone it, but I'm over it in all honesty.  I'm just hoping season 2 won't turn into a total disaster at this point.This season is going all bat-shit with the plot for book fans. Everything is changed. Bronn being Commander's Watch. Jon going Sherlock Holmes on Craster. Rakkharo getting axed. No Riverrun. No Jojen and Merren Reeds.I want to say that as a fan of the book, the changes are making this show a whole new adaption to the books. As season 1 was very faithful to the plot, this season is just getting weird. I know they're gonna do some more weird shit to Dany's plot upcoming episodes too because people thought that her arc is boring. Well, I've been telling one of my friends that the show is always going to the show and not the book. I always liked the books way more and no show can do them justice.
1606	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-04-14	I'd be shocked if Bronn doesn't die in the Blackwater.  He has no real purpose after this season.I hope you get shocked in that case.He is an awesome character and Martin isn't even done with him yet for all we know.
1607	Reposado	2012-04-14	obvious move. bywater doesn't show up enough to be worth introducing. A more strange choice was not sending 20 men with Slynt to the wall.
1608	Hedge Lawyer	2012-04-14	I think that is the first inkling he gets that Bronn is really all about Bronn.  Previously he knew he was a merc of course, but there were some lines he thought wouldn't be crossed.  This is the first time he sees a Bronn in the light that ends up (bookwise) poorly for Tyrion.  Who knows what will happen here.It would be rather odd for Tyrion to ask Bronn now to fight for him later on.To be fair, Bronn never really betrayed Tyrion.  He simply declined to sacrifice his life in something that would have almost certainly been a futile gesture.  Bronn still (and sincerely, by my reading) wished Tyrion well.  Very few men would have been willing to face the Mountain. Bronn basically declined to go on a suicide mission. The Viper had very personal reasons for agreeing to be Tyrion's champion, and he ended up sacrificing his life.As for making Bronn the Captain- I don't really like it (it doesn't make much sense, and it would have been way too obvious of a power play on Tyrion's part) but I can absolutely understand why they did it.  There are already too many characters, and I would rather have Bronn as captain than not have Bronn on the show at all.
1609	jugdesh258	2012-04-18	I wondered will Bronn get a new uniform?How long will he stay commander of the City Watch?Anyone else note the disappointment on Tyrion's face for the answer Bronn gave to the question posed to him?I thought the book did say at some point he was at least wearing armor of city watchThe book is also clear on what Tyrion thinks here.  He does not need to keep ruthless babykillers around like cersei would suggest is a necessity to maintain rule or keep power.  Not that he would ask since he has disdain for this behavior, but the fact that a guy like Bronn is around suggests that killers are basically a dime a dozen anyway
1610	Si Targaryen	2012-04-18	Bywater was killed by his own men during the Battle of the Blackwater.As a Bronn fan, I hope that he doesn't end up with this fate instead.
1611	Voshed	2012-04-23	Seems a logical step, but might cause a few challenges later in the story
1612	Fgnn	2012-04-29	In the book, Tyrion says the following to Bronn after the Slynt is taken off:Varys would have me believe that I have replaced one of Joffreyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s men with one of my own. More likely, I have replaced Littlefingerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s man with one belonging to Varys, but so be it.This little quote says vast amounts about the current situation in kings landing regarding who really holds the power, a central theme of the book. LF and Varys are really in control rather than Tyrion or Cercei. Tyrion understands this however, and has no choice but simply let it play out.By cutting Bywater, an important layer of depth indicating just where the power lies is lost. Even if they cut Bywater for the sake of not adding extra minor characters, they could have somehow worked in Varys influence on the process and kept the above quoted line.
1613	Reposado	2012-04-09	Admittedly, the Lysene pirate is one of my favorites from the books, but I loved his introduction and the relationship established between Saan and Davos. I hope they include him as much as possible. Did he hit everyone else's expectations?
1614	Ran	2012-04-10	He's broadly playing the same sort of function, but there's obviously some notable differences. I would have liked them to have change his name, since he represents a different character unconnected with the history of the Saan family in the novels (and there is a history that hasn't been made explicit in the books)... but just as a character, Lucian Msamati was excellent. Loved his exchange with Matthos. He's imbues the role with great zest and energy.
1615	Arrogant Bastard	2012-04-10	I thought he was great. I think I would have been more annoyed had they changed his name; I don't really see the need. He's clearly playing the same role as the books, with some definite tweaks, and ultimately I don't really care about his backstory. I was surprised the character was cast, as I thought for sure he was a character they would cut, but I'm glad they kept him. Hope to see him again when/if he explains the Azor Ahai Nissa Nissa story to Davos.
1616	Tourniquet	2012-04-10	He's broadly playing the same sort of function, but there's obviously some notable differences. I would have liked them to have change his name, since he represents a different character unconnected with the history of the Saan family in the novels (and there is a history that hasn't been made explicit in the books)... but just as a character, Lucian Msamati was excellent. Loved his exchange with Matthos. He's imbues the role with great zest and energy.I'm also glad that they didn't change his name. I understand that they changed his backstory (by omission, and by not making him Lysene) but the nod to fans is worth more than what was left on the table I believe.
1617	Lord Varys	2012-04-10	Well, what's the history of the Saan family that is not established in the books? And why should it matter if it's (as of yet, and possibly even in later volumes) not revealed? After all, Salladhor Saan has been written out of the series. I very much doubt we will see him every again...
1618	Blizzard	2012-04-10	I really liked him and the scene with Davos, I hope he is shown more in the series.
For some reason I want to see a scene with him interacting with his crew. I want them to be similar to him also speaking in the same sort of accent

1619	Odie Wan Kenodie	2012-04-10	Lucian Msamati was excelent, just perfect.
1620	iheartseverus	2012-04-10	I liked him.  LOL, some reviewer didn't catch his name, said it sounded something like 'Salad or Sandwich' so that's what he's going to call him from now on.  Me, too!  I'll never be able to look at the character the same way again--it'll be like 'Oh, look, here comes the Salad or Sandwich pirate!'
1621	Ser Dermett Corbray	2012-04-10	How can anyone not love a guy who's biggest demand is to boink Queen Cersei? Think the handful of future Davos/Saan scenes will be good /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
1622	Crown	2012-04-10	The dialogue was excellent, especially his interaction with Matthos and his stuff about Cersei.
1623	Ferrum Aeternum	2012-04-10	Fun character, provided some comic relief to what was largely a heavy episode.
I also thought he captured my impression of book Sallador nicely.  My only complaint with that scene was the whole setup of them walking on the beach seemed awkward and a little out of place.  I'd have rather seen them dockside a la  the book, but I'm sure the change was made for the sake of budget.
1624	Milcov	2012-04-10	Saan was brilliant. One of the best bits of the episode IMO.
1625	Fylimar	2012-04-10	Saan was a favorite minor character of mine in the books and I love, how he is portayed in the series, even though, he is obviously not Lysene. Doesn't matter to me - I love the actor, he did a wonderful job.
1626	Maester Murks	2012-04-10	I loved how they portrayed him. On my first read i even pictured him black, maybe because of his name (Sallador sounds like it has the same origin like Jalabhar...). Didn't really get the Lysene background thing.
His scabbard looked great and very pirate-like and the way he walked and his accent completed the package for me. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

1628	Ran	2012-04-10	Ah, nowhere. Maybe the original GoT RPG from Guardians of Order, perhaps, but probably not there either. I think I have it in the World of Ice and Fire, but we'll see if it stays.
1629	Hear Us Roar	2012-04-10	yeah they did a great job
1630	Spooky Scary Jurble	2012-04-10	I wish they had changed his home city/ethnicity at least. A black Lyseni? preposterous.   How are TV-show viewers supposed to construct conspiracy theories about Varys if they're under the impression that the Lyseni can come in all colors?!
1631	Ser Plissken	2012-04-10	Why can't he be both black, and from Lys...?
And does it really matter?
1632	Spooky Scary Jurble	2012-04-10	I'm sure there are a few Summer Islanders or Sothyros dudes in Lys.  But Saan is Lyseni, it's his ethnicity.  And the Lyseni are no more black than the English.
And it matters for the sake of consistent world-building.  I don't know if you've read ADwD or not, so I won't get into, but consistent world-building is key for certain theories to function.

1633	kephv	2012-04-10	The guy who played him is great. One of my favorite parts of the episode.
1634	Arrogant Bastard	2012-04-10	I'm sure there are a few Summer Islanders or Sothyros dudes in Lys.  But Saan is Lyseni, it's his ethnicity.  And the Lyseni are no more black than the English.And it matters for the sake of consistent world-building.  I don't know if you've read ADwD or not, so I won't get into, but consistent world-building is key for certain theories to function.That's true of the books, but the show is never going to go into the ethnic details of the Lyseni; probably 95% of viewers don't even know what or where Lys is. Saan's ethnic background is of very minor importance in the books, and of no importance for the show. Other than being black, the character is pretty much the same and serves the same function, so a name change is hardly necessary, at least in my opinion.
1635	Holmes	2012-04-10	Frankly, I've always viewed him as being black, just on the way he spoke.  Straight out of the Caribbean, imo.
That being so, I felt he hit a homer with the role.  Even if Lysenes are supposed to be Valyrian-looking.
He really should be a follower of R'hllor, though.
1636	Envie	2012-04-10	Wait, did they say he was Lyseni in the show? I thought they omitted that so it wouldn't matter if he was black or white or any other color - just that he's a pirate friend to Davos. I know it matters more in the book, but for the short period of time Saan is in the series, I don't think it matters that much at all.
This is one of the places I think most people like / agree with the character portrayal changes. I actually always envisioned him black / islander too.
1637	Spooky Scary Jurble	2012-04-10	Wait, did they say he was Lyseni in the show?Yes.
1638	Delmas	2012-04-10	I freaking loved him!!! /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' />
1639	Many and More	2012-04-11	I would have liked them to have change his name, since he represents a different character unconnected with the history of the Saan family in the novels (and there is a history that hasn't been made explicit in the books)...Ooo, so were the Saans vassals/relatives of the Targaryens? Or Blackfyres? My poor brain is overflowing with speculation after that little spoiler!
1640	The hairy bear	2012-04-11	Why can't he be both black, and from Lys...?Because in the Free City of Lys the Valyrian ancestry is strong, and fair skin and eyes are a distinctive trait. In the books, a character is described as having "the blue eyes and flaxen hair of Lys." And all the characters we've seen from there (Doreah and Saan) have those traits.And does it really matter?Well, to some people yes, at least. Mainly those who care for not only the story per se, but also the worldbuilding. I know I would kill to know how the father of Jahaerys I was named or why the Manderlys fled the from the Reach. It's part of my enjoyment when reading the books. For those of us who care, I'd have been a nice gesture to rename the character and make him from the Summer Islands (or casting an actor with the Lysene traits).Also, depending on the developments of future books and if the show continues for many seasons, it might generate a plot problem. Saan isn't likely to become a main character, but some theories supporting the fake Aegon VI thesis suggest that his mother would be Lyseni (explaining his features, and also consistent with Magister Illyrio having traveled to pleasure houses in Lys, where he bought Doreah).

	Spoiler It becomes clearer in episode 4, when you realize we're hearing a similar accent again on another character.
1642	Tywin's bastard	2012-04-11	The part was very well played. It became a character you instantly got attached to through body language and accent.Because the in the Free City of Lys the Valyrian ancestry is strong, and fair skin and eyes are a distinctive trait. In the books, a character is described as having "the blue eyes and flaxen hair of Lys." And all the characters we've seen from there (Doreah and Saan) have those traits.But since the Free Cities are rich in trade it wouldn't just be the native people living there so someone from Lys should be able to have any skin color. It just removes his place as the "stereotypical" Lysene.That's of course a moot point after Ran's post though.

1645	Chelly	2012-04-11	I thought he was so much fun. I really enjoyed what little scene he had and it really brightened the mood of an otherwise dark and heavy episode. Hell, most episodes of GoT are pretty darn heavy(part of why I love it!), so its nice to get some fun time with a genuinely entertaining character and actor. I dig his accent, his mannerisms, and his line deliveries are spot on. I particularly liked him clarifying to Matthos that he planned on banging Cersei not raping her and that he can be very convincing. Heheh. I'm looking forward to more Saan and his wonderful exchanges with Davos.
1646	Robin Of House Hill	2012-04-11	I think the casting for Saan is perfect.  Changing the name would have bothered me far more than his skin color not matching the book.  He's fun to watch.
1647	Lebronn Jaime	2012-04-11	Anyone have an excerpt explicitly stating what Salladhor's skin color is? I realize he's from Lys, proof of that is not what I am asking for.

Heh, sorry, sometimes I just can't help myself.I guess it's no secret that a guy who calls his ship Valyrian probably has family roots in Old Valyria. I wonder if he will turn out to be a Targ loyalist in the end? Valyrian would make a nice flagship for Dany's eventual return to Westeros, wouldn't it?Back on topic, I liked the actor who portrayed Saan in the show. He is very charismatic and did a good job with the dialogue he was given.

I am happy to hear this Ran.I'm with the other dude who said that the subject of race matters in terms of world building.So if I did not mistake your message can it be safe to assume 
	Spoiler that Summer Islanders are migrant people who do not constrain themselves to their homeland?  In my mind I was telling myself that Saan was an immigrant of the Summer Islands that settled in Lys and that Xaro was a merchant of the Summer Islands that made a very good name for himself in Qarth.
1650	Towel	2012-04-12	I always imagined most of the free cities (especially the ones with slave trades) as closer to south american/ carribean type cities (or at least running cities like that). Having family that are brazilian by way of portugual that run that gamut from ginger to "so black they are blue" as the summer islanders are, saan being black made perfect sense to me.

From what I remember I do not recall overt racism in ASOIAF, if there is contempt between cultures and peoples in the books it is usually if they are peasants, bastards, or wildings.I'll admit that it seems to be human nature for societies to make groups of them and us in their minds, but Qarth might have been rewritten as a free city of merchants from all reaches of the world with a primary focus on trade rather than ethnicity?
1653	Triskan	2012-04-12	I think the guy they pegged is absolutely fantastic.  Great choice. 
The inconsistencies with the books don't bother much on a minor character like this. 
It does make me wonder though...how are racial issues handled in the industry?  Is it totally up to the show's creators? 
That is to say, would Dave and Dan be like "Yeah, we have no choice but to have Bran Stark be a white kid, but with SS we're willing to interview all comers?"
1654	Towel	2012-04-13	South America and Caribbean have people with a lot of different skin tones, but until recently the upper classes were all light skinned,So this is bullshit immediately. Not true. There were TONS of well off non light skinned. Fuck even my family from Portugal are much more what you would call "darker skinned" and they were wine merchants. You realize that Spain and Portugal is like a stones throw from Africa right?

1656	The Freshmaker	2012-04-13	I liked him.  LOL, some reviewer didn't catch his name, said it sounded something like 'Salad or Sandwich' so that's what he's going to call him from now on.  Me, too!  I'll never be able to look at the character the same way again--it'll be like 'Oh, look, here comes the Salad or Sandwich pirate!'Onion & Salad lolThe actor did great, but they thought of Saan as a minor character that's why they didnt bother with the ethnicity anymore. /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' /> Doreah was also from Lys but doesnt look near Valyrian at all.
1657	Free Northman	2012-04-13	I found the focus on Saan's obsession with ravishing Cersei to be a definite deviation from the books. If you're a female viewer of the show, the way he was horse trading over Cerseis private parts would actually generate sympathy for Cersei against your own better judgement.
In the books, Saan's reference to wanting the Queen always appeared to be an off-hand comment made partly in jest, kind of like that one gateguard telling Arya that he wanted to screw the Queen.
Saan was always motivated by the gold, and I doubt whether he ever realistically thought Stannis would allow him to have his way with Cersei should King's Landing fall. Stannis it too honorable for that.
So I found myself liking the TV Saan considerably less than the charming book Saan, and he came across as more of a sex obsessed maniac than the witty, world wise rogue he is portrayed as in the books.
Bad move from the TV show writers in my view.
1658	gramblor	2012-04-13	I loved his line to Matthos: "I can be very persuasive.... I haven't tried to fuck you" and the look on Matthos' face
1659	teemo	2012-04-14	He's a great actor and has his speech down to a tee, I just imagined him much more elaborately dressed.

1660	Ran	2012-04-14	Lyseni are always noted in the books by their fair hair and blue eyes -- they are quite Valyrian, apparently. The old blood of Volantis are even more Valyrian in appearance. The Braavosi are much more mixed, being descended from all sorts of refugees and escaped slaves from Valyria. The Myrish are described as being dark-haired and dark-eyed, with olive skin -- more a Mediterranean look, basically, not terribly disimiliar to the salty Dornish.
So there's a bit of a mix. Saan in the novel is a fair-haired, bright-eyed Lyseni of Valyrian descent. Saan in the show is a Summer Islander that has, somehow or other, settled in Lys.
1661	Lebronn Jaime	2012-04-14	Saan in the novel is a fair-haired, bright-eyed Lyseni of Valyrian descent.Do you have a quote or page number to support this description?
1662	kungtotte	2012-04-14	In the books, Saan's reference to wanting the Queen always appeared to be an off-hand comment made partly in jest, kind of like that one gateguard telling Arya that he wanted to screw the Queen.While it was more flippant in the books than in the show, I think he was very serious about it in both versions. Everything about his personality tells me he is the kind of man that would demand a queen as his prize.
1663	Reposado	2012-04-14	In the books, Saan's reference to wanting the Queen always appeared to be an off-hand comment made partly in jest, kind of like that one gateguard telling Arya that he wanted to screw the Queen.That's just gonna happen with a lot of minor characters in the show. We're not gonna see that much of them. The few lines they get will seem magnified since they're not mixed in among dozens of other lines.
1664	Spooky Scary Jurble	2012-04-14	Do you have a quote or page number to support this description?You dare ask Ran for sources?  GRRM is the one that asks Ran about character descriptions/appearances. (No, seriously.)

1666	Spooky Scary Jurble	2012-04-14	Too lacking in reading comprehension to see a joke.
1667	Ran	2012-04-15	The source for the description is the fact that he's Lyseni and every Lyseni ever described is fair-haired and pale eyed. Indeed, people are identified as Lyseni because they're fair-haired and pale eyed.Every. Single. One.Including ones who call their ship Valyrian, who is related to a guy (father, grandfather, uncle, or some such)  who was known as "the Old Valyrian". They've got a bit of the blood of Valyria, and they're from Lys, ergo ... fair.Lyseni=fair and pale in ASoIaF. If he was an unusual Lyseni in appearance, away from the norm, it would have been noted. As his foppish, flamboyant clothing is particularly noted, for example, because it's unusual and worth mentioning.I don't really understand the resistance to this point, other than the fact that people failed to remember how Lyseni are described in every other instance and decided for some reason that this one man would somehow conform to an ethnic appearance out of the norm because he's... what, flamboyant and talks funny? Is that really the association one wants to make between behavior and ethnicity?

You are the one associating "talks funny" with ethnicity. Nothing is stopping a Lyseni from having dark skin, just as nothing is stopping an African from having light skin. Nativity != Ethnicity.Salladhor Saan on the show is from the Summer Isles in origin. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
	Spoiler It becomes clearer in episode 4, when you realize we're hearing a similar accent again on another character.
If D&D changed his origin to the Summer Islands, fine; we'd then have something else to complain about. I just want you to realize that you made the association that you're implying is stereotyping (at best - at worst you're accusing people of racism).

1669	Ser Lepus	2012-04-15	So this is bullshit immediately. Not true. There were TONS of well off non light skinned. Fuck even my family from Portugal are much more what you would call "darker skinned" and they were wine merchants. You realize that Spain and Portugal is like a stones throw from Africa right?The spanish and portuguese colonialist society was very racist, only in a different way that the north-american one. The north-americans divided their society into black or white and nothing in between, while the latins had a several levels of gradations in between: mulatos, cuarterones, zambos, cambujos...etc., and they were expected to fit a place in society according to their origins. Less attention was given to your skin tone per se, and more to how it indicated that you were descended from somebody who was a pagan or muslim slave.Yes, sometimes a black skinned person could rise in society above what was expected of him, but that was not the norm, and he/she would have to fight social pressure and prejudice. If you take a look to the portraits of the famous politicians and intelectuals from South-America, they were overwhelmingly european-looking until recently; the leaders of the War of Independence during the XIX century were all white people of spanish ascentry, the leaders of the Cuban revolution during the XX century were all white people too, Castro is the grandson of spaniards and Che Guevara are descendants of spaniard colonists (they even claimed to be descendants of a spanish viceroy). There was a lot of racism, only it was less overt than in other places of the world.Portuguese are darker-skinned than other european ethnities (partly because Portugal was conquered by african muslims during the Middle Ages, and partly because during the Modern Age up to a 13 % of PortugalÂ´s population were black slaves who eventually intermarried and mixed with the rest until getting completely assimilated), but they are still recognizable as europeans.Maybe you and me arenÂ´t meaning the same when we say dark-skinned. When I spoke of prejudice against dark-skinned people I was referring to people dark as Lucian Msamati, not dark as Antonio Banderas.And anyway we are speaking of Westeros and Essos here, which are medieval societies (maybe renaissancentist, for the Free Cities), not XX century societies; we should look to how society was back then, not to modern examples. Do you know any example of somebody like a black Xaro or a black Saan?

1670	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-04-15	The history lesson is nice and you are right in that this is a medieval setting.
I still think you are puting too much weight on historical race relations when referring to possible race relations in a fictitious world.
One of the reasons black Africa was colonized and raped was because in our own history black Africa was at a disadvantage, especially in the field of warfare.
In the world of ASOIAF there is no reason to believe that the advancements of Summer Islanders was not on par with the rest of the fictitious world.  It is also a bit asinine to assume that the cultures of this world are necessarily as racist as ours has been. In a world where there are races like Children of the Forest and White Walkers the whites of ASOIAF might recognize the humanity in black members of the ASOIAF. 
Ser Lepus, you just need to think outside the box a bit as there are all sorts of situations where maybe Summer Islanders could strive.  It is also to be considered that Essos as a whole seems to be more pragmatic than Westeros and skin colour might not be considered as valuable as your economic value.  Even Westeros doesn't seem completely white-washed if you interpret the Dornish to be a "middle-eastern looking" type of people.

Even Westeros doesn't seem completely white-washed if you interpret the Dornish to be a "middle-eastern looking" type of people.I was just answering to @Towel about what he said about racism in Latin America.You are right: The Summer Islander seem a technologicaly and economically developed people, and they probably command quite a lot of respect. There are also the corsairs of the Basilisk Islands, who are a seapower on themselves.But if you look at the world of ASOIAF, and to the society of the Free Cities, itÂ´s obvious than volantene and lysene still keep to a extent the valyrians looks, while the pentoshi and myroshi have lost them (IÂ´m not sure about Tyrosh). That points, I think, to the volantene and lysene not mixing with or taking in other peoples (at least not their upper class), while the myroshi and pentoshi do.Think of that: the volantene have 5 slaves per free person, and most of these slaves come from SlaverÂ´s Bay and half of those are of lhazarene or dothraki origin (Storm of Swords, Daenerys chapter), the original inhabitants of the area were the Rhoynar, they are visited by hundred of merchants from SlaverÂ´s Bay, Summer Islands, Ibben, Myr, Pentos...etc. None of those people share their valyrian looks; if they were intermixing with OR taking in foreigners as part of their society, they would have lost those valyrian looks long ago...but at least the upper classes keep them. Lys is very similar to Volantis.I think that Pentos and Myr are likely to take in foreigners, but Volantis and Lys are not.

1672	Eichenlaub	2012-04-19	I did notice that salla differed in appearance from the books, but the most jarring thing was I thought his costume would be more remarkable. I think it is impossible to separate racial concepts i'm fiction from racial concepts in our culture because, for the most part the whole concept of race is a product of culture as much as language is. Genetically speaking there are more differences amongst black Africans than between Chinese and Swedes. They should have just made the dornish black in the show which would have allowed the use of black actors in major roles and not caused accusations of racism in the way the ethnic look of the dothraki did. Atleast all the evil blondes helps balance things.
1673	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-04-20	I was hoping for more colorful manners of dress as well with feathers and all that.
I'm sure some would cry out that the flamboyance was somehow racist as well.
Eichenlaub, have you read "race is a four-letter word the genesis of the concept"?  Anyways I agree with your stipulation but since the world is a fictitious one you can still strive to restructure the worldview as it is a different world.
That being said I would be upset if there was an even ratio of races arbitrarily mixed among each Westerosi Kingdom as that just wouldn't make sense to me and would seem like pandering.
1674	Voshed	2012-04-23	Brilliantly cast...just as I saw the character from reading CoK. And has been rematked beofre in this thread...Whats not to like about a man who wants to Give Queen Cersi one
1675	Binadas Sengar	2012-04-27	The idea that nation and genetics cleanly overlap is a tired myth in our own world.  Pirates and sailors end up everywhere.  Lys is in much more favorable position to be reached from the Summer Isles than many other places in the East.  Of all the crappy changes in the first episode that seemed blatantly unfaithful (to the books) Saan's casting seemed the easiest to swallow.I wish they had changed his home city/ethnicity at least. A black Lyseni? preposterous.   How are TV-show viewers supposed to construct conspiracy theories about Varys if they're under the impression that the Lyseni can come in all colors?!
1676	spork	2012-04-12	In this episode Tyrion and the small council got the message from the Night's Watch by raven.  Why didn't Ser Alliser Thorne appear and make the request in person?  Doesn't seem like it would take more screen time, and he's already an established character.  In fact, their interplay would have been great.  He even got sent there by Mormont, as in the books, so it was kind of expected that he'd show up.
1677	spork	2012-04-15	/bump
1678	Early Earl	2012-04-16	It would've taken time away from the more expensive actors. /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />
I actually enjoyed that scene. Making a credible diaolgue with Thorne would have taken more time that they could now use to show us more pointless sex-scenes.
The only thing I missed was the rotten hand.

1679	spork	2012-04-16	It's just weird that in S1 Mormont sends a message via Thorne, but then in S2 that message is delivered by raven.  I dislike the lack of continuity.  And so do new viewers, according to the TWoP forum.
1680	Davos55	2012-04-16	He may still show up with the hand later on.
1681	Thendel	2012-04-17	In the books, Thorne doesn't appear before after Tyrion learns of Stannis taking the fight the Renly (he poisons Cersei while they celebrate the news, allowing him to seat himself on the Iron Throne).
1682	spork	2012-04-17	According to the Wiki, Thorne is presented around the same time as Robb's letter, and before Renly is slain.  We've already seen Robb's peace terms, and instead of Thorne we got a raven.  Maybe Owen Teale got busy with another project and couldn't make this season?
1683	Davos55	2012-04-19	I am still hoping he will return. In the DVD commentary on season 1, one of the producers talked about his character, and they said they absolutely loved the way Teale played him and they looked forward to having more of him in the future!
1684	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-04-20	I just thought he was making his trip the KL to show us his hand, get ignored and have nothing but bones to boast of.
It is weird how quickly Ros can get from Winterfell to KL and how long it takes to get from the Wall to KL.  I don't let myself be bothered by these things.
1685	Davos55	2012-04-20	True, I still think he may show up though, or else why would he come back to the wall eventually? Will he just tell Jon he went there but came back because he got no help?
That is a possibility I guess.
1686	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-04-20	There is no way that HBO will pass up on the chance of Tyrion being a dick to Thorne again.
Although show Tyrion seems more conscientious of the dangers north of the wall...
1687	Davos55	2012-04-20	I couldn't really see Tyrion telling Thorne off on the show after the conversation he had with the council earlier. He seems pretty set on trying to help out the Night's Watch. He may not like Thorne a lot, but he is still a member of the Night's watch nonetheless.
Idk, maybe he will show up and Cersei will be a dick to him, that would certainly be in character.
1688	boojam	2012-04-22	In this episode Tyrion and the small council got the message from the Night's Watch by raven.  Why didn't Ser Alliser Thorne appear and make the request in person?

He even got sent there by Mormont, as in the books, so it was kind of expected that he'd show up. Owen Teale has been gone for so long now, I really wonder if he's off the show?The character does show up in later books, but not in a big way... so it's a puzzle?
1689	Umberto	2012-04-13	So how did you all like Gilly?
I think she was brilliant, very close to how I imagined her. It wasn't very long at all, but that scene with her and Sam was probably one of my favorite parts. The chemistry is there at once, they are meant to be together /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
I cannot wait for their scenes in Season 3...
1690	Galen M	2012-04-16	She is way, way too cute for her role.  I just can't see her being the hardened wildling woman she is in the book.
1691	Silverx2	2012-04-16	She is way, way too cute for her role.  I just can't see her being the hardened wildling woman she is in the book. Gilly was far from a hardened wildling women in the books. she was one of crasters daughters, thats it. the hardest thing she did was carry a baby through the woods with sam.You may be thinking of ygritt..You know nothing jon snow
1692	leo0274	2012-04-17	why in the Brazilian version of the book Gilly's name is Goiva? anyone knows?
1693	All Men Must Rhyme	2012-04-18	Yeah, she was pretty cute in a goofy, inbred sort of way. It seems Sam's acting is a lot stronger in this series. Loving the Northern scenes so far.
1694	Ser Sweets	2012-04-18	Her looks are exact to how I imagined her and her acting seems fine so far.
1695	Eichenlaub	2012-04-19	Is anyone else looking forward to a certain sex scene?  They better not punk out.
1696	Chelly	2012-04-21	I thought she was super cute. IIRC, in the books, Gilly was always viewed as a cute girl. There were some lewd comments in AFfC about her being a wetnurse to Mance's baby. I think. She's certainly not thought of as ugly.
I found her and Sam to have some believable chemistry in the little scene of them.
					
					
							Edited by Chelly, 21 April 2012 - 08:24 PM.
1697	Dementia	2012-04-10	I'm a little worried.  And obviously this is all just me freaking out about 'what ifs'...but I'm curious what contracts the actors have signed.
Conan Stevens dropped out, so now we're going to have to have a new Mountain.  Now Elyes Gabel gets a better job and they kill Rakharo.
As the series goes on, more actors are going to be noticed.  Will we have a new Mountain every season?  Will Rakharo's brother/cousin take on the role?  Will whole stories have to be rewritten?  Right now, they're not huge deals.  But...
...I'm scared.  Hold me.
1698	Davos55	2012-04-19	I have thought about that before as well. If they are going to play out the whole series, it is going to take a long time! I am scared as well haha, but I hope we don't have to worry about that for a long time!
1699	Lord Davos Seaworth	2012-04-14	At first I assumed that Davos' son shown in the show was Devan, as he appeared to be Stannis' squire. (Although I did find it strage that he seemed a little too old...)  But when Melisandre whispers into his ear that there is no purer death than by flame, I felt that she was foreshadowing his death on the blackwater... So is he Devan or one of Davos' older sons?
Or is he perhaps a hybrid of both? (Meant to play Devan's role but actually die on the blackwater)
1700	Davos55	2012-04-16	I was wondering about that too. I think he is meant to be one of his older sons, who will die on the Blackwater. I don't know if they will introduce Devan or not after that, but maybe they could later on this season or next season.
Great Name btw! Davos All the way!
1701	Thendel	2012-04-17	I think they just reduced Davos' number of grown-up sons in service to Stannis to one called Matthos (he also seems to take the role of maester Pylos, as he's also shown writing Stannis' letter). Will he die on the Blackwater? Only if they decide to play out Davos' shortlived plans of murdering Mel in the next season (which I didn't find very interesting nor vital to the plot), and only if book-Devan doesn't have any role to play in any of the last two books.
1702	Lord Varys	2012-04-09	Just a place to discuss their roles in the series - or better, the lack of them (at least in season 2). Do you approve of it, don't you like, do you thinks it's a mistake, do you think they can still repair it?
1703	Tourniquet	2012-04-10	Didn't Stannis have 2 people follow him from the 'Seven' burning ceremony in Episode 1? He almost forgot to wait for them but looked back. Reached out a hand and had who I presumed to be his wife and daughter leave with him?
					
					
							Edited by Tourniquet, 10 April 2012 - 08:37 AM.
1704	Bastard of the White Knife	2012-04-10	I think it's a huge mistake.  One of the great images from the books was Stannis' family - headed by the iron-willed, unmerciful yet suprisingly thin-skinned Stannis, standing near his thin-lipped religious zealot wife (whom he dislikes) and their scarred daughter whose campion is a morose jester that creeps everyone out with strange prophesies.
1705	Lord Varys	2012-04-10	Yeah, the fact many people dislike Stannis and/or his cause is the fact that he is surrounded/supported by a group of questionable/unsympathetic characters (i.e. Selyse and Ser Axell Florent). And Stannis's faction is not that dynamic. We still have the King's and Queen's Men in ADwD. All they had to do is to introduce them. It's not that they are going anywhere...
And yes, Queen Selyse does exist. But apparently she is not Mel's most devoted follower.
And the Queen's and King's Men vying for Stannis's ear is actually an interesting background struggle. I guess they will have to do this eventually as Stannis/Davos/Mel will have virtually nothing to do in season 3 if they truly end up splitting ASoS into two seasons. They can only go to the Wall in season 4 - after the Red and the Purple Wedding.
And Shireen, well, she has to appear. If she's not there, Stannis cannot die/fake his death in ADwD/TWoW. Neither Selyse nor Melisandre could succeed him, but as soon as the news of Stannis's alleged demise reach the Wall, Shireen will be declared Queen. If Stannis has no heir, they would have to rewrite everything if the series even reaches this point of the story.
					
					
							Edited by Lord Varys, 10 April 2012 - 09:02 AM.
1706	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-10	I'm not entirely sure that it's necessary to see Selyse or Shireen.  We barely see the in the books. Selyse's main function is the book is in bringing Stannis around to Mel's cause (or vice versa) and Shireen's main function is to introduce the idea of greyscale and the odd fool Patchface who has an uncanny ability to see the future (but since no one pays him any attention his ability doesn't really help any). 
Yes, the power struggle between the King and Queen's men is interesting in the book but it was basically a struggle between fervent followers of R'hollor and those not incline to that belief.  We have already been shown the beginnings of this divide between Matthos and Davos (as a struggle between elders and young) which shows we don't really need to include the idea of King's Men and Queen's Men to illustrate the divide. 
If they go the storyline that Stannis fakes his own death (which isn't even verified in the books yet), they still don't have to show Shireen.  Just saying he has a daughter is enough to point out that he has a possible heir.  We didn't see Stannis last season yet we were told he existed and that Robert had a true heir in him. 
I have to admit though that I was very interested in seeing what sort of homely woman they'd make as Stannis' wife and how they might have envisioned greyscale to look.
1707	Lord Varys	2012-04-10	Selyse is actually more than an extra in ADwD. She is not only interacting with Jon Snow at the Wall, she is an important political player of her own after she arrived at Castle Black. Shireen does not have more screen time than, say, Tommen, but it's important to know that she exists (and this episode raises doubts about it).
The 'conflict' between Matthos and Davos Seaworth does not in the slightest resemble the quarrel between King's Men and Queen's Men. Davos and Matthos talked about religion and atheism, not about two different religions. Further, it does not seem that Matthos/Davos would actually have a true quarrel over religious matters. It's evident that Matthos deeply loves his father, he is no substitute for Axell Florent or Selyse Florent Baratheon.
Stannis may not fake his death, but either somebody else faked his death (i.e. Ramsay), or he is dead. The next POV chapter at the Wall (most likely from Melisandre's POV) will feature Her Grace, Queen Shireen of House Baratheon, the First Of Her Name, etc. Selyse would be entirely stupid to ignore the news about her husband's death. If it's a lie, well and good, then Stannis will still be king. But if not, then Shireen must be declared Queen as soon as possible or their whole cause will crumble at once. Shireen might wear her crown only for a fortnight, but she will be queen.
1708	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-10	Selyse is actually more than an extra in ADwD. She is not only interacting with Jon Snow at the Wall, she is an important political player of her own after she arrived at Castle Black. Shireen does not have more screen time than, say, Tommen, but it's important to know that she exists (and this episode raises doubts about it).ADWD is book 5 in the series.  We are only on season two of the show.  We have already been told that ASOS will be split into two seasons.  The adaptation of ADWD is years away.  The audience knows Stannis has a wife.  Not introducing her face doesn't change that and nor does it yet have any affect on how they choose to write Season 5/6.  I don't agree that Selyse is an important political player in ADWD.  What I got from her interactions with Jon Snow is that the nature of the wildlings is very difficult for those south of the wall to understand.  I personally think it's important that the audience know that Shireen possibly exists, but if she does exist on the show I do not think there is any need to see her. The 'conflict' between Matthos and Davos Seaworth does not in the slightest resemble the quarrel between King's Men and Queen's Men. Davos and Matthos talked about religion and atheism, not about two different religions. Further, it does not seem that Matthos/Davos would actually have a true quarrel over religious matters. It's evident that Matthos deeply loves his father, he is no substitute for Axell Florent or Selyse Florent Baratheon.The very basic quarrel between the King's Men and the Queen's men is one based on religion.  Even though Davos brings in the idea of atheism, the discussion between Davos and Matthos is still one about religion.  The father and son can love each other deeply and still have that quarrel.  I don't see the problem there.Stannis may not fake his death, but either somebody else faked his death (i.e. Ramsay), or he is dead. The next POV chapter at the Wall (most likely from Melisandre's POV) will feature Her Grace, Queen Shireen of House Baratheon, the First Of Her Name, etc. Selyse would be entirely stupid to ignore the news about her husband's death. If it's a lie, well and good, then Stannis will still be king. But if not, then Shireen must be declared Queen as soon as possible or their whole cause will crumble at once. Shireen might wear her crown only for a fortnight, but she will be queen.I agree that if they follow this storyline it's probably necessary for Shireen to exist in the show.  If they write her out now, then the butterfly effect will change a whole lot of things.  We don't know if they've truly written her out.  If they haven't, it still doesn't mean we have to see her at this time. Just know she exists is all that's necessary for viewers.
1709	ViennaGirl	2012-04-10	If Shireen and Patchface aren't in the show at all, then that changes how I think about ADWD - I've re-read Patchface's weird comments thinking they might mean something regarding the bigger story arc. But if GRRM is involved in the show, and the show writers don't write them in, then Patchface doesn't mean anything. Sure, it's possible they'll appear later, but hmmm. Maybe in the books, Shireen's purpose is to show greyscale, and in the show, they'll show it in another way. If that's even important. Which I was also assuming, but maybe not. Oh well...I love the show anyway - gives us all something to talk about for the next 5 years until the next book.
1710	dtones520	2012-04-10	Shireen and Selyse arent a big part of book two anyways. So you can introduce them next season. You have a decent number of characters leaving the show after this season or early next with Maester Luwin, Rodrick Cassel, Alton Lannister (Cleos Frey), some random Ironborn, Renly Baratheon, etc. dying. You also only have Xaro and the warlock in Qarth for this season and the Pyromancer in KL.  So thats at least 7-8 characters/contracts that open next year for Shireen, Selyse, the Reeds, Edmure, maybe the Blackfish, Ramsay etc.
Remember, they have a budget. You have to pay a fulltime actor more than you do some glorified extra. So some characters have to wait.
1711	Fredwin	2012-04-10	Yeah, I don't think they are being cut out of the show. They were just cut out of the season. To introduce all the important things about Stannis you don't really need his wife or daughter actually present. Now if they could just nail how his character is actually portrayed in the book.
1712	ghost the direwolf	2012-04-10	Didn't Stannis have 2 people follow him from the 'Seven' burning ceremony in Episode 1? He almost forgot to wait for them but looked back. Reached out a hand and had who I presumed to be his wife and daughter leave with him?Actually you are right, i assumed it was Selyse i am not sure if there was a daughter as well . Will have to rewatch the episode again.
1713	Bastard of the White Knife	2012-04-10	Yeah, I don't think they are being cut out of the show. They were just cut out of the season. To introduce all the important things about Stannis you don't really need his wife or daughter actually present. Now if they could just nail how his character is actually portrayed in the book.The quote from Melisandre is that Stannis does not have any children and that he keeps his wife locked away. Certainly, Sylese and Shireen don't get a lot of "screen time" and I know that a TV show has a budget, but the writers could have said "Stannis Wife and Daughter are in a different part of Dragonstone" and it would have cost them absolutely zero dollars.
1714	addie	2012-04-10	Actually you are right, i assumed it was Selyse i am not sure if there was a daughter as well . Will have to rewatch the episode again.I am positive Stannis leaves the ceremony with a "wife" (or at least a woman), that I took for Selyse. I don't think Selyse or Shireen are needed in this season. As pointed before, they don't play a huge role in ACOK (Shireen's main function is to offer us another regard on Dragonstone), and there actually are lots and lots of other people more interesting than them in this season in Westeros. Not a huge fan of this episode, but I least I'm fine with them cut off the show this year.
1715	Reposado	2012-04-10	And the Queen's and King's Men vying for Stannis's ear is actually an interesting background struggle. I guess they will have to do this eventually as Stannis/Davos/Mel will have virtually nothing to do in season 3 if they truly end up splitting ASoS into two seasons. They can only go to the Wall in season 4 - after the Red and the Purple Wedding.yes, but a struggle that will be hard to implement in the limited screen time that they will have in the show. splitting it or not, there is a long time in asos where there is not much for stannis and mel to do, while davos is jailed in dragonstone. they will have to fill that with something, and they don't need to introduce a kings men/queens men plot now to do thatYeah, I don't think they are being cut out of the show. They were just cut out of the season. To introduce all the important things about Stannis you don't really need his wife or daughter actually present. Now if they could just nail how his character is actually portrayed in the book.It sounds like there is no shireen. Mel says his wife has given him only still births, not still births and one daughter. selyse will be cast eventually i'm sure, but i doubt there will be a shireen
1716	sennahoj	2012-04-10	granted, Mel's line suggests there is no Shireen. More than that, we learn that the queen is supposedly sickly, which also is a difference from the books IIRC. so could the writers in some way given the sickness, be it greyscale or something else entirely, to the queen instead? having no successor at all may make Mel's offer to give Stannis a son all the more tempting than having a female, albeit sick heir already. I have no idea how Stannis is going to react on the show, when he finds out that there is not that much substance to Mel's promise of a son. He could even threaten to put Melisandre to the sword for being the witch she is. Obviously this is just conjecture, but couldn't Mel offer to use her powers to heal Selyse, maybe ensure the birth of a living heir, which might be Shireen? I know how that sounds and it would be quite a substantial change from the books, but knowing the changes that have been made in the series, would it be inconceivable? I think not.
All I am saying is: If the series progresses to a point where it will absolutely be necessary for Shireen to exist as an heir, I am sure they will come up with some sort of plot twist to make it happen. The way the series is written makes both the queen and Shireen irrelevant at the moment.
1717	GSP	2012-04-10	I was instantly bothered by there being no Shireen and presumably, Patchface. I've always suspected GRRM has a lot more in store for both those characters. Does he colloborate with the show's writers to give them heads up about his stuff? I suspect not, seeings how last season a major character in the next book had his tongue ripped out by Drogo.
If patchface is indeed the prophet of the drowned god and ends up being taken seriously at any point, or Shireen gets propped up to lead the cause in the possible event of Stanis' demise, how do you correct for that shit?

His name is mentioned 7 times in the first 5 books (5 in GOT, 1 in SOS and 1 aDWD). He is Khal Jhaqos blood rider, which can be replaced by a new Dothraki in the show named Bago. You are acting like they kill some major player like Varys or something.
1719	dtones520	2012-04-10	Mel's quote states his wife has given him no sons, only stillborns. It says nothing about a daughter, which leaves it open for them to add a daughter later. Simple as that
1720	GSP	2012-04-10	Mago is also a POV character for the next book, no? So frankly, you have no more clue how big a deal he is going to be than I do.
I'm not 'acting like' anything. I was just pointing out that the writers for the show don't seem to be bouncing their changes off of GRRM, who would have presumably gave them a heads up on that one if they did.
Yes, you can introduce 'Bago' in the place of 'Mago'. The same does not hold if Shireen and/or Patchface become a big deal. Or does it? How do you undo the fact that Stannis has no progeny with Shireen emerging as an important character, if that were to happen?
I can't remember the exact dialogue from the show, but Selse had given Stannis ONLY death or something like that. It seemed pretty explicit that Stannis had no children, not just no sons.  Anybody able to confirm the dialogue?

1722	lojzelote	2012-04-11	Mago is also a POV character for the next book, no? So frankly, you have no more clue how big a deal he is going to be than I do.IÂ´m pretty sure that GRRM has said heÂ´s not going to add any more POV characters. So no.
1723	ChromeWeasel	2012-04-11	Just a place to discuss their roles in the series - or better, the lack of them (at least in season 2). Do you approve of it, don't you like, do you thinks it's a mistake, do you think they can still repair it?Its not a mistake yet. We'll see if it's a mistake later. Both characters are significant in the novels. The fact that we havent seen them yet doesnt mean they are eliminated from the story.This reminds me of the big stink that people made over the dire wolves early last year. That was premature. The dire wolves were and are a pretty significant part of the show. People were just impatient and hyper-critical.
1724	Clariana	2012-04-11	Yeah, and the "only death" quote could be taken as an indirect reference to Shireen... Given that she survived greyscale and should be dead.  In ADWD I think it's Val who says she should be killed since she considers her to be still contagious or unclean... Something of that ilk.
1725	The Unborn	2012-04-11	Mago is irrelevant. Whatever he does next, another Dothraki can do. Its not like he had a huge background and we knew him. 
As for Shireen, I think people are overanalyzing what Mel said about sons and stillborns. She never talked about a daughter. The option is still there, and its way too early to say that they decided to cut her altogether from the show.
1726	Lord Varys	2012-04-11	Mago is indeed not at all that important. And they did introduce Khals Pono and Jhaqo last episode. Jhaqo is the really important guy in the coming Daenerys-Dothraki story in TWoW. Mago's place in the series could play Jhaqo's new bloodrider who hates Daenerys because she caused Mago's death, or something like that. And if Jhaqo (or said Mago replacement) is responsible for Rakharo's death, this would actually fit the story nicely.
1727	Bastard of Boston	2012-04-12	I think the producers are being purposefully vague when it comes to Stan's family. The logistics of a TV show do not seem to have a place for an extensive cast, and beyond that, casting actors to comprise roles which are not going to be vital for 1 or 2 more seasons is also an awkward situation to be in. I account this as the reason why certain characters, like Selyse (who is only seen from a distance), Shireen, and Damphair (on Theon's end) have not been truly revealed on the show. I think the producers are trying to leave things with Stan's family as open and vague as possible. This will allow them to introduce the characters later, when they feel the characters are truly needed for their narrative, and when there's more time to develop them -- this season is already stacked with so many new faces...more might be too overwhelming. The clever word play Mel used (referencing only sons) also allows the producers time to even decide if Shireen is necessary to what they're doing with the show's narrative.
I imagine the TV show to be very strategic -- seeing how long you can get away with putting off certain character introductions. Selyse can be locked in her tower all season, easily enough, if she's sickly and depressed, and then be revealed next season, played by a well-known actress they couldn't squeeze in to this season. Same with Shireen and Patchface.
1728	Lord Varys	2012-04-12	Yeah, but why not introduce Shireen as Stannis's daughter and heir by at least mentioning her? Nobody insisted that Shireen play an important role this season. I'd have been content with namedropping only. We got Lothor Brune mentioned, and saw him as an extra. Even Randyll Tarly was mentioned, so they could have mentioned Shireen as well. She truly is politically important. So this smalls more like cutting than mere omitting for the time being, although I'd love to be surprised. After all, with ASoS becoming two seasons, they have to introduce us to more characters on Dragonstone. I'm quite sure Edric Storm will be introduced in season 3 as Stannis's ward, not Renly's, since the whole Penrose plot seems to have been dropped.
As to Aeron: I'm quite sure his introduction scene will be his first chapter of AFfC, but set in season 4 of the series, since the whole Kingsmoot stuff most likely is going to be placed in the season covering the second half of ASoS. But they are most likely going to be mentioning all the Greyjoy brothers, especially Victarion, since he is going to separate Robb from the North...
1729	Lord of Brewtown	2012-04-12	I agree that I'd be content with namedropping only.  We don't need to see Selyse and/or Shireen.  But, it's a HUGE mistake to write Shireen out of the script (if they are).  Changes the character of Stannis, and There's just really no need to do it.  That smacks of D&D trying too hard to put their stamp on the story.
1730	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-12	I disagree that Shireen is politically important.  In general, Stannis' followers barely even consider her existence, let alone consider her an actual heir to the throne.  Men aren't vying to be betrothed to her with the same voracity we see with other heirs.  Massey even seems confused about why he should continue his quest for sellswords if Stannis is rumored to have died.  Shireen's narrative importance often doesn't seem that great.  We learn about greyscale from her but that information doesn't really become useful until ADWD and we get Patchface, who is such a mysterious character because we don't know much about his origins or how he can seem to have prophetic jingles.  The only truly meaningful dialogue we've had from Shireen is that she dreamed of dragons.  Maybe she will become a much more important character in future books, but the text so far doesn't suggest that she already is.
That being said, I'd still like for her to exist on the show, even if only by name right now.
1731	GSP	2012-04-12	"only stillborns, only death" seems to imply no daughters either imho.
Of course, my concerns could be totally off base. Shireen and Patchface very well could remain fairly irrelevant background characters, in which case there is no issue. But I highly suspect at least one of them comes to greater importance by the end of the series.
1732	Free Northman	2012-04-13	Mellisandre's comment indicates that Shireen does not exist in the TV show.
That and the downgrade applies to Stannis's wife, immediately implies that they aren't gonna live much longer in the books either. One thing I love about the series is how it subtly gives away hints of things to come, which us readers have been arguing about for ages.

1733	dreamcatcher	2012-04-13	Just because Shireen and Patchface aren't in the show, it doesn't mean that they aren't important in the long run. We didn't even have a ToJ scene, and that's probably the most important & most discussed scene ever, and it definitely means something. The writers are just simplifying the story and writing out characters so that they don't over-saturate the show. They could still bring in a child and a fool named Patchface in later seasons, if need be.

The writers are just simplifying the story and writing out characters so that they don't over-saturate the show. They could still bring in a child and a fool named Patchface in later seasons, if need be.But how have they been important in the books?  Selyse's biggest part in the books has been to introduce Mel to Stannis, but anyone could have introduced Mel to Stannis and things still would have worked out the way they did.  Apart from Pathface, Shireen's biggest part has been to introduce us to greyscale and we could learn about that anytime from any character.  You are right, though, anyone could be introduced as the fool Patchface later on down the road.I do think it's odd that we haven't gotten any sort of TOJ flashback or storytelling and I'm super sad that Meera and Jojen haven't been cast.  Those do seem like very important parts of the story.  Shireen and Selyse have simply not been very important at all thus far.
1735	Lord Varys	2012-04-13	Both Selyse and Shireen became extremely important during ADwD. At least on the political field, not as characters. Shireen is Stannis's heir, and in TWoW she will be declared queen. Selyse is going to be her Regent, she will rule the remnants of Stannis's forces at the Wall and have might actually influence what happens up there in no small scale.
Shireen is as important as Tommen or Myrcella to the series. She is very much a child, a non-character, but she is an important figurehead. And despite the fact that Stannis did not marry/betroth Shireen to anyone yet, I'm quite sure Queen Shireen is going to marry someone in TWoW. Gods, it might even be Tormund.
The fact that Stannis did not betroth Shireen to anyone shows that he is not willing to use his daughter as bargaining chip to bind lesser lords to his cause. He did not offer her the Florents or some lesser Stormlords back in ACoK, so it's out of question that he would consider promising her to one of his household knights (i.e. Massey, Horpe etc.)
1736	the wolf warg	2012-04-13	No sons; only stillborns, only deathEveryone is taking things out of context, they worded it so that it was confusing. I think they will include his wife and daughter it was just not needed in the show yet
1737	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-13	I'm truly and honestly not seeing it, Lord Varys.  Maybe there are large parts of the plotline I have forgotten, but from what I'm recalling no one is even trying to betroth themselves to Shireen (There's more interest in betrothal to the heir to the Iron Islands!).  I agree that Stannis made a logical choice by not even considering using Shireen as a bargaining chip for an aliance.  I agree that as it stands, Shireen is his heir and Selyse would be Queen Regeant if Stannis were to die.  But he's already got a very uneasy hold on his followers.  Followers that only consist of what's left of some of his wife's family and his bannermen, northerners who appear content to use him to reestablish claims and rights to their territories, and perhaps some wildlings who don't seem to really care about his cause. Everything I've read in the books has given me the understanding that if Stannis dies, his cause dies with him.  Maybe Shireen and Selyse will attempt to continue the rules from the wall, but again, they are surrounded by people who really don't give a crap about their cause. I'd be pleased to hear your insights to see what I might be missing.
1738	Lord Varys	2012-04-13	I don't give Queen Shireen that much time to rule, either, but we can't know for sure. Melisandre will back them. And if we follow the logic of the 'Queen's Men'-thing, most of Stannis's men are actually Melisandre's men.
I could even see Jon being married to little Shireen, if he returns from the dead (and is no longer considered/accepted as Lord Commander/brother of the Night's Watch).
But I'm sure we agree that the crowning (and death) of Queen Shireen I Baratheon will be an important event. It will happen in TWoW. Either because Stannis is well and truly dead, or because his wife and daughter are led to believe he is dead. If Jon's men (i.e. the wildlings) still intend to go south to avenge Stannis - even after Jon has been murdered - Selyse and Shireen would at least have resemblance of an army. Marsh's men cannot hope get rid of them, not even if all the Night's Watch was with them (which they are not).
1739	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-13	Would Melisandre back Shireen and Selyse if Stannis were well and truly dead?  Furthermore, why would her Queen's Men continue to blindly follow Melisandre if Stannis were well and truly dead?  Mel gained her position of power amongst Stannis' followers because she preached that Stannis was Azor Ahai reborn and that he had a most extraordinary task.  If he's well and truly dead I think it would be likely for Mel to be revealed as giving false prophecy and losing the trust of her supporters.  She's 'read the flames' a tad inaccurately before (Alys Karstack instead of Arya Stark) but I can't see her followers shrugging their shoulders and going along with it if she says, "Oh, but I simply read them wrong.  Shireen is actually Azor Ahai reborn."  Melisandre disappeared quite abruptly as Jon finished reading Stannis' letter.  It almost seemed as if she realized how perilous a position she is in if Stannis is well and truly dead.  Of course, there are other explanations such as she was going to inform Shireen and Selyse or she was going to gather the rest of the Queen's Men to march with Jon, but I tend to not consider those explanations as valid possibilties when Jon is distracted by Queen's Men running amok and terrorizing a giant trying to get to Val.  That particular scene seemed to be screaming out at the reader that Selyse and Melisandre no longer had power over their men.If the Queen's Men are no longer following the queen(s), then Selyse and Shireen no longer have an army to support them.  When they stabbed Jon, Marsh and others pretty strongly indicated they did not want the NW to take part in anything to do with avenging Stannis or retaking Winterfell or besting Ramsay and the only ones who actually agree to follow Jon were wildlings, and I don't believe they are going because they care even one iota about avenging Stannis.  Jon might say aloud that he wants to avenge Stannis, but his general thoughts indicate that he also doesn't really care all that much about that task.  So no army for poor Shireen.I agree it's possible that Shireen could be crowned, but I think it's unlikely that it will be an important, narrative altering event.  I once wondered if Mel would try to burn Shireen in order to use her king's blood as part of a magical ritual, and that might be narratively important, though I can find no evidence that Mel might do this. You mentioned something that I never considered before; Jon marrying Shireen.  Val calls Shireen death and the last we see of Jon he is nearing dying.  It's such an interesting idea to explore.  What would it mean?  Does have any similarities to what we know of the Night's King and his wife?  Would this path make Shireen's possible crowning important?  I'm sort of excited now when I think of all of the the narrative possibilities if Jon and Shireen were to marry.  In this, you've convinced me that Shireen's arc could be more than I expected.  Truly enjoyed this discussion, though I am sorry I sort of hijacked it from the OP's original intent.
1740	Free Northman	2012-04-14	Both Selyse and Shireen became extremely important during ADwD. At least on the political field, not as characters. Shireen is Stannis's heir, and in TWoW she will be declared queen.

He did not offer her the Florents or some lesser Stormlords back in ACoK, so it's out of question that he would consider promising her to one of his household knights (i.e. Massey, Horpe etc.)What I'm saying is that their ommission from the TV series may indicate that your forecast for Winds of Winter may not come to pass. It may well be that the faction that killed Jon will also either kill Shireen and her mother, or take them captive and hand them over to the Boltons to distance themselves from Jon's alliance with Stannis.Either way, the outcome could well be both their deaths, thus negating the need for their plotline in the first place, hence the move by the TV show to ommit them from the start instead.
1741	The Knight of Flours	2012-04-14	Didn't Stannis have 2 people follow him from the 'Seven' burning ceremony in Episode 1? He almost forgot to wait for them but looked back. Reached out a hand and had who I presumed to be his wife and daughter leave with him?I thought it was the daughter.  She appears to be a small figure and the way she runs from the crowd made me think she was a child.
1742	Lord Varys	2012-04-14	Well, we should not consider the TV series as authority on story development in the books. The fact that there was no speaking Jeyne Poole in season 1 is not going to change the fact that Ramsay is going to marry her as 'fake Arya'. Just as the fact that there as of yet still no Tullys/Reeds in the series is not going to change the importance of, say, Howland Reed, Brynden and Edmure Tully to the series.
As to Shireen's role:
Her Greyscale (and Connington's in the south) is the first hint, in my opinion, that we will see a plague spreading through Westeros. But Shireen's fate might be even worse. She will not be burnt, but if her Greyscale returns Mel's ritual to save might have interesting consequences... Remember Dany's vision of 'the stone beast breathing shadow fire'? After we have learned the term 'stone men', it's not so unlikely that Shireen might be transformed into this 'stone beast'. She might still be sane and herself afterwards, though, remember what Moqorro did to Victarion's arm...
We should keep in mind that Mel is not using Stannis and his family. She actually seems to like/love Stannis, and in my opinion this also includes Selyse and Shireen. If Selyse begs her to save her daughter even if they all believe Stannis is dead (which I doubt Mel does) Melisandre will do everything she can...

1743	Princess of the Night	2012-04-15	Shireen doesn't say much in books but I believe that she has a huge role, and it would be ridiculous not to put her in the series. But, so do the Reeds, and as far as I understood, they are not casted for this season. Maybe they will all appear later in the series..
1744	The Non-Human	2012-04-15	Mel's quote states his wife has given him no sons, only stillborns. It says nothing about a daughter, which leaves it open for them to add a daughter later. Simple as thatI sorely hope this is the case. I was quite disappointed when I thought Shireen was left out.
1745	Bastard of the White Knife	2012-04-17	I sorely hope this is the case. I was quite disappointed when I thought Shireen was left out.As would I, and doubly-so for Patchface.  I agree that the most literal reading of Melisandre's words allow that they could case Shireen and Patchface down the road.  Why they couldn't have said "your wife gave you no sons, only a diseased daughter" is disconcerting, however.
1746	The Mega Sage	2012-04-11	Three major plot points that people seem to have a problem with in episode two are the characterizations of Stannis, and specifically his quavering "A ... son" comment, Ros and her nervous breakdown from having watched a baby be killed in front of her, and Joffrey ordering the male babies of his father killed, none of which appeared in the books (to the best of my knowledge). These are three pretty big changes from the books, but instead of assuming the incompetence and/or lack of care from the creators, by looking at these three scenes, and how they work in the context of the entire episode, I think it's plain to see the changes were done on purpose, and for a very specific purpose.Almost every major plot point in this episode revolved, in one way or another, around a son dealing with his father. I believe that this is a watershed episode in the *television* series of A Game of Thrones, because it does make so many large character changes, but it does it in a way that is consistent within the *television* world of Westeros. It's obvious the creators aren't going to ignore the books, and I imagine they will still be very faithful to it, but this episode, more than any other, is where they seem to have stepped out from the (lengthy) shadow of the books to say "We have something to add as well". Quite a few of these plot points are consistent with the books, but it's interesting that they placed them all in this particular episode, as though ... on purpose.Gendry is marked for death because of his fatherWe find that Gilly is worried Craster will kill her baby if he finds it's a sonRos is broken up because she watched a son be killed in front of herWe find out Joffrey ordered the death of his "father's" bastardsTheon returns and is put in his place by his fatherDavos and his son have a difference of opinion about religionMelisandre promises Stannis a son, and he gives in to her ("A ... son")Jon follows Craster giving his son to a white walkerThose are 8 plot points (in a 50 minute episode) directly relating to the relationship between fathers and sons, or in how people deal with those relationships. This is, in my opinion, something done on purpose by the show creators, and because of that, I am much more forgiving of the changes they have made from the books. These weren't changes made simply to be different from the books. They are changes which support the theme of episode, and to make a more powerful television episode.
1747	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-12	Ros was broken up over baby Barra being killed, a bastard daughter, not a son so that would make your list 7 points related to fathers and sons.  But the rest of the points happened in the book and the relationship between sons and fathers was a theme explored in the books.  I think the frustration is in the presentation of how these scenes play out within the show.  In the books, some of the things on your list are very subtly implied.  In the show, it's all explicit.  The main question within the debates is whether or not the character GRRM created int he books is lost on a TV screen where subtly is a very difficult tool to use.
1748	vinnie1912	2012-04-12	The Ros scene was about Little Finger just like all Ros scenes are about the other character/s present.  It could have easily been a generic whore.  And it would have been if the writers had not liked the actress so much that they decided to write the character into more scenes.
1749	TeamDanyArya	2012-04-12	The theme of fathers and sons is quite strong in books so I think this is a valid thing to explore especially with some of the changes made. The show needs to start being looked at seperately from the books I think at this point going forward. Characters will be cut that will serve no purpose for building upon themes and plot points within the TV show. As long as the show doesn't deviate heavily from the books, for example, 
	Spoiler  Stannis winning the Battle of the Blackwater 
 or 
	Spoiler  Renly making it through to the end of the season 
, then it's okay to make those changes.
1750	_Oberyn_	2012-04-13	Based on season one i would not dismiss "incompetence and/or lack of care".
	Spoiler Marillion anyone  /dunce.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunce:' />

He also was not bothered to piss in front of her when he already knew she was not a boy. But when he learns she is a highborn, he starts apologizing and panicking, and he wants to spare her any inconvienience. What is going on here? Shouldn't everyone be equally concerned for any girl/child/human being? I know panick is understandable on his side, the need to show manners... hm. Suddenly strenghtened concern is not... Is it what people simply do? Give more to those who already have enough?

It might have something to do with the fact that Arya's brother is a king and has the power to end his life without second thought or any consequences. (yes I know if Robb actually went and killed Gendry it would be out of character, possibly cause all sorts of trouble to his rule etc etc, but Gendry doesnt know that.)

In fact the class differences were even worse than that. Thank you lucky stars you live in the modern world.
1758	Sixshells	2012-04-12	Low-borns are not entitled the same amount of respect and deference as high-borns, even a little girl of ten. It's as simple as that. I also think the excuse is clumsy to translate Gendry's surprise at discovering a noble girl, the daughter of a man who went to see him not so long ago, in the convoy: he doesn't know how to behave properly in such a strange situation (stranger than having a commoner girl going around in boy's clothes).

Look at Theon killing the Millers children, it didn't matter as they were lowborn and look at the Hound riding down Mycah and how no one other than Arya cares about it. If you aren't highborn you don't matter.
1760	zippypoodle	2012-04-12	The crying Ros scene backs all this up. None of the rich and powerful people cared about Barra's death. Only the whore.
1761	Hear Us Roar	2012-04-12	He thought she was like him a low born nobody.
Highborn are in another league
1762	Hear Us Roar	2012-04-12	The crying Ros scene backs all this up. None of the rich and powerful people cared about Barra's death. Only the whore.not many would care today unfortunately, not just the wealthy
1763	girlfrommonday	2012-04-12	Low-borns are more close to each other, in terms of bodies. For example, they can live in one room etc. I don't think they piss in front of others constantly, but they not keeping all this "savoir-vivre" rules. They just see each other constantly. Girls from noble family growing up more separated from another sex. Although for every girl piss-situation is inconvienient, I can imagine that highborn girl could freak out.

I do not really understad /blush.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':blush:' /> And I am not that much surprised, more confused. And more in terms of life in general than this scene.  Regarding the examples you cite, they were about what highborns choose to do with lowborns, not how lowborns threat each other and highborns. Gendry seems decent and even kind, but he was not interested in sparing a girl, however nice she was, until he learned she was highborn. It was not fair. Especially coming from him.
1765	Silverx2	2012-04-12	Since Arya Is a highborn, she is given special privileged. By being in her favor a person might be granted gifts, or favors. Highborns are seen as a higher class of people.
I guess the simplest way to say it is a highborn is like a Prized steed, while a commoner is like a cow. One is expensive, highly sought after, the other is used to make food.
1766	Maginor	2012-04-12	I don't think that Gendry saw it as disrespectful to piss in front of a girl in the first place. Could he really cause any harm by doing that? But society has taught him that highborn girls are porcelain dolls that one should be very careful with.
1767	Silverx2	2012-04-12	I loved the way gendry teased her at the end of the scene.
I should be calling you milady
dont call me milady!
as milady commands
*Shove*
oh well that wasnt very lady like.
It goes great with things he says in the next book when they meet up with TBWB
1768	Victaerys Ironfist	2012-04-12	Nah man, aSoIaF and GoT is based in a time when the smallfolk would rever, if not have a great amount of fear or respect, highborn people just for the sake of being highborn. Arya is also irritated by this as she a) doesn't want Gendry to act out-of-the-ordinary around her for fear of her being found out, and /cool.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='B)' /> she doesn't like being thought of as "meek and lovely" like Sansa.
1769	Sixshells	2012-04-12	"Afforded more"? Could you please say it in other words?

Gendry seems decent and even kind, but he was not interested in sparing a girl, however nice she was, until he learned she was highborn. It was not fair. Especially coming from him.He is from a city where promiscuity is chronic and that is full of orphans fending off for themselves and most likely not always able to hide to piss and shit (think about homeless people nowadays. Who cares that some of them are girls? Especially if she tries to pass of as a boy, it's completely at her risks and perils. Also, the people in the convoy to the Wall don't expect to have much privacy. Think about how Arya could not risk to take a bath at the inn because she would have had to show herself naked and break her cover.Gendry is actually being decent enough since he did not reveal her disguise even before knowing she was highborn, nor does he try to take advantage of his knowledge of her secrets.
1770	Odie Wan Kenodie	2012-04-12	Caring about taking a piss in front of someone is actually quite 19th century bourgeois. Earlier no one really cared, except the church, especially not peasants and workers. The only important thing was to not take a piss in front of anyone with a higher rank if you could avoid it.
1771	Envie	2012-04-12	Regarding the examples you cite, they were about what highborns choose to do with lowborns, not how lowborns threat each other and highborns. Gendry seems decent and even kind, but he was not interested in sparing a girl, however nice she was, until he learned she was highborn. It was not fair. Especially coming from him.Why do you think its especially unfair coming from Gendry? You do realize Gendry has no idea he's the bastard son of a king, right? He's never been told and this has repeatedly been pointed out via the books and scenes in the series. Both hands have asked him about his Father and so has Arya. Every time he shrugs and says he doesn't know. He barely remembered his Mother who died when he was young and that's when (presumedly) the hand had him placed with the blacksmith shop as an apprentice.As a blacksmith's apprentice, he has learned that one respects and defers to high born (nobles) because they have money and power. They come to his master's shop to buy expensive armor and weapons and their ladies are treated as fragile sensitive things not to be spoken to, let alone pissed in front of!When Gendry begins to realize (somewhere along the journey) that Arry is actually a girl, he doesn't immediately expose her. I'm assuming he went on treating her like a boy, pissing in front of her, probably talking bawdy jokes and stuff in front of the other boys, etc. - He may not have even been certain at first if she was a girl at all. To Gendry, if she's a girl trying to pass herself off as a boy heading to the wall and the night's watch, she must be a "low-life" peasant who has something to hide as a girl. Peasant or commoner girls wouldn't have any power to be 'insulted' regardless whether or not they're offended by him pissing in front of her.When the truth comes out who she really is, Gendry is immediately freaked out and understandably so. As others have said, she has the power (or her brother / parents do) to have him killed if she should decide to complain about any behavior he's done in front of her. I'm quite sure this fact has been 'hammered' (quite literally) into Gendry's head by his blacksmith master. You would never EVER be insulting in front of a high born, let alone a lady, and especially those who would come into your shop as potential customers. It's just a respect that's been taught to Gendry about high borns. All commoners of Westeros would grow up with this outlook I'm pretty sure.Does this help you better understand why Gendry got more freaked out and apologized profusely after he found out who Arya really was?I really really loved this scene in the show btw. One of the best of the entire episode. Gendry's actor is doing a fantastic job and he's SO handsome! I can almost imagine what he'd have been like as a true prince had he not been born a bastard. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> *swoon*

He's spent his entire life being deferential to the highborn, and not only was he engaging in locker-room talk with a noble, but a noble Lady.In the right context, a common soldier can swear freely in front of a highborn officer like Jaime, but you don't ever talk like that in front of a Lady.

I guess I mistook your last lines where you said,  "It's not fair. Especially coming from him (Gendry)"  to imply you thought Gendry should somehow be different in his attitudes towards a noble girl because of his own background.The fact Gendry believes himself to be lowborn should be all the more reason it IS believable for him to be shocked and suddenly wish to treat Arya differently. Not because she's a girl, but because she's the daughter of the ex-hand of the king and a noble Lord.
1775	teemo	2012-04-12	I've still never been sure if Gendry is being totally serious with her when he does that.  I think he's partially just kind of toying with her because he knows that she'll hate that /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />  I mean, Gendry was never all that respectful to even Ned when he was the Hand....he doesn't really care.

It was really well done.Everyone having read the books knows Gendry still treats Arya the same afterwards outwardly and has told her he'll keep her secret so the fact he is astonished by her being a 'lady' is not really taken that seriously anyways.
1777	Silverx2	2012-04-12	on a side note, someone needs to make a jumpcut of all the times Arya calls someone a liar. i cracked up both times, as hotpie was starting to tell his story about seeing a battle and Arya shouts out liar mid sentence.

Arya's been calling everyone a liar since she threw Joffrey's sword in the river and will keep calling everyone a liar for quite some time, haha!
1779	Buckwheat	2012-04-12	What I found strange in this scene was that it happened in the middle of the camp where anybody from the group could have heard their conversation. It would be a little more logical if they made them go fetch that water some meters away, behind some trees or something. But, all in all, I liked the scene.

But, all in all, I liked the scene.I don't think it happened in the middle of the camp... they were both down at the stream getting water in buckets, well away from the majority of others in the camp. I didn't get the impression it would be easy for anyone to over hear the conversation. Besides, those headed to the wall (voluntarily or against their will) are kept under close guard in case they decide to make a run for it so I doubt they'd be off in the woods somewhere out of sight.

And apparently they had other matters to handle than to listen to children arguing, as well.
1785	Envie	2012-04-13	And just who are these 'guards' ?Yoren is the only NW man in the whole crew...no others in the book or on the screen.I said 'under close guard' not 'guards' - someone has to be watching to make sure the petty thieves don't try to take off since some of them have been spared punishments for thievery and such. Rorge, Biter and Jaqen may have been the only caged criminals but they weren't the only ones. Perhaps the 'volunteers' to the night's watch keep an eye on the others, especially the younger boys? Yoren can't possibly keep that many in line by himself and it would be pretty easy for someone to just take off.From the book: "Yoren had taken grown men from the dungeons as well, thieves and poachers and rapers and the like. The worst were the three he'd found in the black cells who must have scared even him, because he kept them fettered hand and foot in the back of a wagon, and vowed they'd stay in irons all the way to the Wall. "So if Yoren's completely alone, who is guarding this motley crew of thieves, poachers and rapers? Not all of them are going to go meekly to the wall without protest are they?
1786	Silverx2	2012-04-13	So if Yoren's completely alone, who is guarding this motley crew of thieves, poachers and rapers? Not all of them are going to go meekly to the wall without protest are they?I believe you can see in the episode while Yoren may be the only one in black, a few of the older men gather their weapons and back him up as they surround the gold cloaks. I believe its pretty evident that if they are not already sworn in, they have at least chosen to accept the offer, and plan to honor that oath.

Given Yoren's nature and his long experience at this he is all they need. All those in the group have , under the law, a stigma on their heads, the Wall is their pardon and they know it, escape and eventually you will be hanged or worse!The only person there who could have slipped away is Jaqen, he is on a mission, the mysterious nature of which we still have not found out.

I was confused by the apparent wish, not need, and especially coming from Gendry. As to Gendry being intentionaly playful, I don't think so. And yesterday I got to read an interview with Joe Depmsie, where he admits playing that scene and "whole" Gendry a little different than in the books.I was surprised how fast she told him...in the book it took quite awhile and it was right after the escape from the Gold Cloaks, and they really were away from everyone then.

1789	Milcov	2012-04-14	"Afforded more"? Could you please say it in other words? I do not really understad /blush.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':blush:' /> And I am not that much surprised, more confused. And more in terms of life in general than this scene.  Regarding the examples you cite, they were about what highborns choose to do with lowborns, not how lowborns threat each other and highborns. Gendry seems decent and even kind, but he was not interested in sparing a girl, however nice she was, until he learned she was highborn. It was not fair. Especially coming from him.I didn't put it very well, I was just meaning that she'd command more respect in that society and certainly be treat better. The examples of Mycah and Barra are symptomatic of the society. Compare the reactions of characters to the killings of Mycah and Barra as opposed to the killings of Aegon and Rhaenys. Or would Theon be really so hated if the North knew it wasn't Bran and Rickon he killed. The reason we don't see how they treat each other is because they don't meet. When they do the interactions would be similar to how Gendry thought he ought to treat Arya as opposed to 'Arry. It's not fair but nor is the Medieval Feudal system.

From the last shot in the E3 promo, I take that to be the battle at the holdfast. Makes sense, all the stuff that preceded was pretty much travelog , E2 has covered the important points of that. They need to move Arya's story along anyway , a lot of walking and riding can be cut.

1792	a shadow	2012-04-10	This is no true critique. But as we always go into the smallest details, we can do it here too. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Plot twists and characters aside, there were a few things that went wrong in the latest episode.Turnips. It takes more strenght to bring them along than their nutritional value could ever compensate. No expedition, especially heading North, would waste space and strenght to take sacks of turnips with."You have perfected the art of tearing paper", said Tyrion. He ever witnessed Cersei tearing up Robert's will. It felt like he was apologizing to the viewers "Yes, we've been there, done that"."My mother was a lady", said Arya. Catelyn is very much alive and well at this point. RW are long ahead.
1793	_Oberyn_	2012-04-10	"My mother was a lady", said Arya. Catelyn is very much alive and well at this point. RW are long ahead.Lol, nice spotting. I dont know if it makes any sense anyway since in the books the same conversation/s happen at  different points but still  before the RW.
1794	Dr. Pepper	2012-04-10	"My mother was a lady", said Arya. Catelyn is very much alive and well at this point. RW are long ahead.That line stuck out to me a whole lot. It could have been a simple editing mishap but I think it was probably a very subtle use of foreshadowing.  I wish I had the memory to recall the other instances of subtle foreshadowing in last season."You have perfected the art of tearing paper", said Tyrion. He ever witnessed Cersei tearing up Robert's will. It felt like he was apologizing to the viewers "Yes, we've been there, done that".I think it's possible and likely that Tyrion would have been told what happened to lead to Ned's imprisonment.  We know he knows at least the basics when he questions Slynt so it's not far-fetched that he'd know that Robert's will indicated he wanted Ned to be Protector of the Realm as regent. But Tyrion's line is also probably used to say to the audience, "Hey, remember, we've seen this action before."  Throughout the episode Cersei makes a lot out of how she sees a piece of paper to be meaningless.As far as turnips go...no idea.  Turnips are typical fare in the books.  But it's interesting to know that they hold little nutritional value.
1795	Riffraff	2012-04-10	Why was Jon Snow sharpening Longclaw?
1796	Greywolf2375	2012-04-10	Why was Jon Snow sharpening Longclaw?Because the turnips were frozen and difficult to cut - notched his blade.
1797	Lors' Edrick	2012-04-10	Maybe the point of Arya saying her mother was a 'lady'; is the fact that Cat is now considered a 'Queen Mother' to her son King Robb. Just my opinion.
1798	Milcov	2012-04-10	Maybe the point of Arya saying her mother was a 'lady'; is the fact that Cat is now considered a 'Queen Mother' to her son King Robb. Just my opinion.Would Arya know that?
1799	Fredwin	2012-04-10	Why was Jon Snow sharpening Longclaw? That's how you maintain a weapon. He probably oiled it as well. Sharpening it doesn't mean it was used recently at all. If you want to take it to mean that though, it was a gift and maybe not in use.
1800	FloredaA	2012-04-10	On the subject of vegetables, did someone noticed the potatoes ? definitely not mediaeval-compliant, and not in the books IIRC.
1801	The Red Lamb Chop	2012-04-10	That's how you maintain a weapon. He probably oiled it as well. Sharpening it doesn't mean it was used recently at all. If you want to take it to mean that though, it was a gift and maybe not in use.I think he was more referring to the fact that Longclaw is made of Valyrian steel, which doesn't need to be sharpened cause it's magical.
1802	Fredwin	2012-04-10	I think he was more referring to the fact that Longclaw is made of Valyrian steel, which doesn't need to be sharpened cause it's magical.Ah, that makes sense. Although, I don't ever remember reading that valyrian steel can't use sharpening
1803	The Black Wolf	2012-04-10	"My mother was a lady", said Arya. Catelyn is very much alive and well at this point. RW are long ahead.I interpreted this as Arya seeing her lady mother and sister as part of a former life. Like in the books where she at times remembers things from before Ned's imprisonment and she thinks that it's as if those things happened to another person, to Arya Stark, not Arry the orphan boy.
1804	Greywolf2375	2012-04-10	I interpreted this as Arya seeing her lady mother and sister as part of a former life. Like in the books where she at times remembers things from before Ned's imprisonment and she thinks that it's as if those things happened to another person, to Arya Stark, not Arry the orphan boy.Not even sure if it goes that far - I think it was just more memory of than distancing from, "my mother was a lady and I wasn't".Tyrion I'm sure would have found out all about what happened in the court when Ned was betrayed - Cersei would love to brag about ripping up Roberts,,,anything.
1805	DannySpud	2012-04-10	I thought Valyrian Steel just held an edge really well, you could always make it sharper though. And sword sharpening is a ritual that the NW (and most people who have good cause to have a sharp sword e.g. sellswords) seem to do all the time, Yoren: "I sharpened my blade before breakfast".
Turnips are a good source of vitamin C and other vitamins. I imagine they catch game along the way for their actual nutrition, and use vegetables they bring along for vitamins. Can't really grow turnips on the move.
Just watched Arya's bit again, the conversation goes: "You're a highborn then, you're a lady!" "No! I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister, but-" "You were a lord's daughter and you lived in a castle." I think it's pretty clear they are talking about Arya's life before, unless they are foreshadowing Sansa dying too...
1806	David Selig	2012-04-10	Maybe the point of Arya saying her mother was a 'lady'; is the fact that Cat is now considered a 'Queen Mother' to her son King Robb. Just my opinion. But Catelyn's not considered a queen, at least in the books. Nobody calls her that and she even says straight out to Brienne "My son may be a king, but I am no queen".  Arya doesn't know this at this point anyway. It's most likely a mistake.
1807	a shadow	2012-04-10	Turnips are a good source of vitamin C and other vitamins. I imagine they catch game along the way for their actual nutrition, and use vegetables they bring along for vitamins. Can't really grow turnips on the move..No true expedition going North would ever dream of taking turnips. To get your daily amount of Vitamin C, one person would have to eat around 700 grams of turnips. And they have no significat amount of other vitamins. (we are talking about roots, not greens). Dried (or raw) beans or even dried (or raw) meats would serve better on that count.
1808	Holmes	2012-04-10	The turnips are pretty nitpicky.  Doesn't GRRM call them "Neeps", anyway?  Or is that something else, you think?
Arya saying: "my mother was a lady" definitely not a mistake or intentional.  It's a kid who's living an adventure far removed from her former life, and who hasn't seen her mother in many months or longer.
My nitpicks:
Jon doesn't know shit about sharpening a sword, if he's nicked it.  WTF Jon.  you go lengthwise down the blade unless you want a gougey wave in the edge instead of that nick you got.  Bah.   He's never used it on another sword anyway.
and oh yeah, don't the NW have pickets who would catch Craster running outside with a miracle baby?   Lax attitude on a ranging, boys.  Hated that scene.  Where was Ghost, huh?
Stannis should be perma-grindin his teeth.
Janos Slynt should have third-person self-referenced at least thrice in his sitdown with Tyrion.

1809	bloodymime	2012-04-10	The problem with sharpening these Valyrian swords is their age isn't it? You're going to wear down the blade everytime you sharpen it and if they can get nicked that's even more of it ground away and these swords are hundreds of years old. Anyone with knowledge of the life span of a sword being sharpened on a regular basis?
1810	N. Baratheon	2012-04-10	No true expedition going North would ever dream of taking turnips. To get your daily amount of Vitamin C, one person would have to eat around 700 grams of turnips. And they have no significat amount of other vitamins. (we are talking about roots, not greens).

They probably give as many shits about nutritional value as Walder Frey gives about guest right.
1811	iheartseverus	2012-04-10	I don't think in Westeros they exactly know which vitamins they need from which food groups.  They probably give as many shits about nutritional value as Walder Frey gives about guest right.Agree.  And turnips were a staple food of Medieval Europe (probably one of the reasons their average life span was mid-20s, crap nutrition).  But this is not to take away from the original poster's observations on the series---he's right, you wouldn't take turnips North as a food staple, if you had today's knowledge about food values.  You'd take dried apples, dried meats, dried citrus fruits, greens and aged cheeses.  But Westeros doesn't seem to have today's insight, does it?  I think it takes nothing away from the original poster--he's right, nutrition-wise.  But it also takes nothing away from follow-up posts that Westeros, ignorant of today's knowledge about nutritional values, would haul turnips along with them on their trip North.
1812	Fredwin	2012-04-11	oh yeah, don't the NW have pickets who would catch Craster running outside with a miracle baby?   Lax attitude on a ranging, boys.  Hated that scene.  Where was Ghost, huh?Hah, good point on the NW pickets, but no one is going to stop Craster leaving his own place. The bundle could have been anything until you heard the distinctive baby noises. It's possible he just walk past and they didn't hear it. Not that they would stop him anyways but it would certainly raise eyebrows.Ghost is only around when the plot tells him to be, just like in the book!
1813	Net-Viper X	2012-04-11	I just figured the turnips were to add substance to the extremely greasy stew that everyone seems to eat all the time. The actual nutrition comes from the ingredients of the broth. Probably also has to do with ancient people like this not even knowing what nutrition is and bringing the load of turnips because its the cheapest thing they could find.
1814	Isis	2012-04-11	I'm puzzled by so many people asking 'but where was Ghost?' In the books Jon often wonders the exact same thing!
Grey Wind was most often seen close by Robb (I seem to recall other characters commenting on that) but Ghost was more often than not somewhere else during the time Jon spent beyond the wall.

No expedition, especially heading North, would waste space and strenght to take sacks of turnips with.It costs a human being no real energy to have his horses and mules carry a load of turnips. And medieval humans probably didnt calculate the specific nutritional values of a turnip in comparison to the caloric energy spent carrying one. Actually it looks like turnips were very commonly used, and were considered a pretty staple dietary item until the potato was available. We havent seen potatoes in Westeros yet. So in this case it looks like GRR Martin was correct, and you are mistaken in your criticism.

So in this case it looks like GRR Martin was correct, and you are mistaken in your criticism.Horses need to be fed too. The more strenght they use up, the more they eat. And when it is apparently snow and ice all around, a good portion of the things they eat, must be carried too. Medieval people most likely did not calculate nutritional values in calories, but even without specific numbers, each human notices how a specific food can fill one up, how long it takes to go hungry after you've eaten it. Turnips are practically water and they took loads of it into the place where you can melt snow for water.

1819	SelaBela	2012-04-11	Re: the turnips.  The Night's Watch takes whatever it can get, I don't think they'd squabble about nutritional content if it kept their bellies full on their trip North. Beggars can't be choosers.
1820	Flayed Starkman	2012-04-11	GRRM has said that the ability of Valyrian steel to hold an edge is magical, so I also thought it was strange for Jon to sharpen it. Ned didn't sharpen Ice after he cut the deserter's head off, but he did clean the blade.
Although this is grade A nitpicking
1821	White Harbors Wrath	2012-04-11	This is almost too fantastical to comment on. Wonder what they spiced the turnips with?
1822	Silverx2	2012-04-11	I think the purpose of the turnips was flavor and filler.
With so many men, you need to fill your stews with as much as possible, the turnips would represent add flavor to the stews.
Its also excellent mashed with potatoes.

1833	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-04-11	I dont think it is fair to expect people's of a medieval type setting to contemplate nutritional value.  Things like potatoes, turnips and other stew starches go a long way towards filling your belly.  The Night's Watch isn't rich and it doesn't get much charity when in the south.  Turnips are as much as they can expect from people who consider them a needless joke.  And as I mentioned I really doubt they consider things like antioxidants and the range of vitamins a particular veg or fruit has.
Turnips can fill bellies.

1835	Sixshells	2012-04-12	Agree.  And turnips were a staple food of Medieval Europe (probably one of the reasons their average life span was mid-20s, crap nutrition).

I think it takes nothing away from the original poster--he's right, nutrition-wise.  But it also takes nothing away from follow-up posts that Westeros, ignorant of today's knowledge about nutritional values, would haul turnips along with them on their trip North.The reason the average life span in medieval times was so low is because of high infant mortality rates (mostly because of infectious diseases). If they made it to adulthood they had 20 or 30 good years left in them, and poor nutrition in the long run would be only one of the things that would kill them (again, infectious diseases). Except in times of food shortages or extreme new conditions (like, say, sailing for weeks and months without setting food ashore) most people didn't eat so horribly. Nor were theories on nutrition inexistant before the contemporary era. Plus knowledge about making the best with what you've got, acquired through experience, would be culturally transmitted from generation to generation. Humanity lived, not always well, but all right, for millennia without modern nutritional knowledge.Point is, medieval guys were not morons, and they would know that turnips won't feed someone, unless he eats a lot of it; in comparison to grain, the same can be said for the potatoes featured in the episode, BTW, even if to a lesser extent. However, it's still useful as filler and a flavouring agent for whatever kind of greasy porridge or stew they would likely eat, if that's all they could put their hands on. Not that they would take a lot of it, but enough to have chunks of it at the beginning of the journey. For a trip to the north they would also take lots of fat - something the body craves when it gets cold, and that they can't expect to take reliably out of winter game.Comparatively, it could be said that the use of relatively inappropriate foods could be a hint at the relative lack of foresight about what kind of terrain and climate they will have to survive, which gets blatant later on, as much as their lack of resources.

1836	Caro99	2012-04-12	if tyrion doesn't know that Cersei hates paper and like tearing it apart and at times ignores what they say, he just has to wait till Episode 13. in the preview Ceresi gives him yet another threat saying, "You think the piece of paper father gave you keeps you safe? Ned Stark had a piece of paper too..."
  So he will probably know what piece of paper ned had i guess.
1837	boojam	2012-04-12	On the subject of vegetables, did someone noticed the potatoes ? definitely not mediaeval-compliant, and not in the books IIRC.Well this is not our real world medieval times, but George's parallel universe Earth, so expect perturbations.
1838	The Lunk	2012-04-12	I don't remember from the main books, but in the Dunk and Egg novellas people in Westeros are well aware of what to take with them on a journey for food (salt beef!)
1839	LuisDantas	2012-04-12	There are references to salting food for conservation in the main books; Jaime orders a horse's meat to be salted in AFFC because they might come to need to eat it, and Val carries lots of salted food in an errand in ADWD - she even remarks on it.
It is natural enough that they do, since Westerosi would hardly fail to notice that food spoil, and salt is easy enough to obtain.  Having a recorded story of thousands of years, at some point they were bound to learn that salt preserves most foods.
1840	LuisDantas	2012-04-12	Re: turnips.
I just checked, and at least according to Wikipedia they are reasonably nutrititious, at least as sources of dietary fiber and, perhaps oddly, Vitamin C.
Their foliage, particularly, is very nutritious and a good source of a handful of vitamins.  
I don't particularly expect the Night's Watch to know that and to carry or ask for the greens, however.  Even if they did, I don't think they would last very long.  But who knows.
As an aside, reading nutritional tables can be a very pleasant pass-time.
1841	Free Northman	2012-04-13	The potato nitpick is unnecessary. This is not Europe. This is Westeros. We don't know which foodgroups are native to which continents in Martinworld.
In our world potatoes just happened to come from South America. There is no reason why they can't come from Westeros in Martinworld.

1854	Iron Captain	2012-04-12	It was easter as well, meaning a fair number of people didn't have work/school the next day.  I'm not sure how that affects the ratings (or if it does at all), but I know all of my friends had plans so weren't able to watch either of the showings that night. 
I'll be interested to see how next week's episode goes ratings wise.
1855	Fredwin	2012-04-10	Man. Season 1 and 2 feel like night and day to me so far. At least the first 7-8 episodes of Season 1 seemed both well-paced and pretty well-balanced. I don't know if this is an editing issue or what, but every scene has been rushed so much that the dialogue never gets a chance to *click*. I think the last scene with Craster and Jon Snow was perhaps the first true scene where you at least get some atmosphere and tension because it moves at a normal speed. I feel like there is so much exposition being throw around that nothing is sticking. I'm afraid that the average viewers that make up the bulk of the show's viewership are going to get very confused and very bored shortly. I think we all want to see this show to it's conclusion so I hope the rest of the season is a bit more fleshed out.
Obviously, book 1 was infinitely easier to adapt to screen than book 2 or the others will be, but they've cut so many things out. How did they end up with what they have? 
Also, I don't know what it is, but the sex scenes so far have felt very gratuitous. In season 1 they seemed to have their place just like they do in the book. Even the gay scene, as uncomfortable as that was to watch, seemed to have it's place. The sex scenes in these first 2 episodes so far have felt awkward and made me just kind of roll my eyes. They seem tacked in and not relevant to the plot at all. For instance, Theon's salt-wife? You couldn't even hear the dialogue in that scene which I thought was important. That was a point in the book where you're kind of like "Oh shit, Theon really is a bastard." yet it just came off as sex for sex.
2 other non-related thoughts:
In the book, doesn't Catelyn specfically say not to send THEON to Greyjoy? She doesn't say forget the Iron Islands, does she? Why change that? To make Catelyn look sympathetic to Theon or to make it seem like Theon is going to get brainwashed by his family?
The character Shae, wow. I liked her in the one scene she was in last season, but now she seems so utterly miscast I feel like she's ruining scenes. She's nothing like Shae from the books and she just comes off as nothing BUT a whore. This makes Tyrion come off so much worse than it should.
1856	FloredaA	2012-04-10	I may be wrong but I'm wondering if the show mentioned at all that Mormont and its ranging party  are supposed to meet the Qhorin Halfhand group. In fact I'm not sure Qhorin Halfhand is mentioned at all.
In that light, the Mormont "learn to obey" line to Jon is indeed foreshadowing the difficult order Jon will have to obey later... but will it be Qorin he'll have to "obey" ? or Mormont? 
This change would allow to make without the whole traitors plotline, but how else would it change the story ?
