"Mad Queen",2012-04-08,"so wait  joffrey ordered the killing of roberts bastardsdid i miss somethingbook joffrey would never do that it would be like joffrey admitting to himself that he isnt roberts son or is there any other reason to order the killing of roberts bastards"

"dtones520",2012-04-08,"some of the changes arent too major but jon playing winter woods detective and seeing others  eh i dunno lolits a way of reminding viewers of the others since they dont appear in the book and showing what craster does with his sons in a way that makes an impact on tv"

"Winter's Knight",2012-04-08,"i should have seen raquros death coming classic mauve shirting in the previous episode this episode showed me two things 1 i cant remember any instance in the books where it is definitely confirmed that cersei ordered the killings 2 replacing slynt with bronn instead of swann is a brilliant way of highlighting tyrions hypocrisy"
"Bastard of Boston",2012-04-08,"wow after a lackluster premiere episode 2 made me its bitch maybe the one thing that really bothered me about the premiere was lack of aryaseeing arya gendry lommy and hot pie reminded me of how much i enjoyed their rag tag in clash i cant help but chuckle everytime arya calls someone a liar so quickly this group already seems like theyll have great chemistry going forward add yoren and jaqen into the mix and this is one story arc that ill look forward to every sundayim not a fan of samwell in the book but this show struck gold with who they got to play him hes hilarious without even saying anythinghis constant bewildered or beguiled facial expressions are fantastic and dolorous edd the reason i breathe is so that i can live long enough to hear his next line he reminds me of creed from the officeall he needs is one line to warrant his premiere standing in the universeseeing theons arc start was fantastic smile with your mouth closed so awesome i was apprehensive about who they chose as ashayara but i gotta say so far so good im hoping she can grow into the role even if its hard to see right now really glad they kept in the awkward incestual momentit was one of my favorite parts of the book and ive been waiting to see it on screen also everytime a new location is added to the opening sequence pyke an angel gets its wingsthe dragonstone bits im still trying to digest on the show are they gonna axe the fact that stannis is supposed to have a daughter it seems such a vital aspect of the booksdont know how i feel about this melisandre appears to be much more the tempress on the show i dont mind itits never put out there but mel got her stannis shadowbaby somehow might as well play up the fact that stannis gives in to her out of duty and desirei wonder if aegon the conquerer ever used his dragon table for thatsalladhor is gonna be a lot of fun always good to get confirmation that theres black people in westeros liked the scenes between davos and his songreat setup for the spiritual battle at the heart of the davos arcanother brief dany appearance this weekmirrors the book one thing that took me by surprise thoughrakharo is dead thats a pretty big wtf moment considering well hes not supposed to dielastly the kings landing crew lena continues to kick my ass with her cersei this woman deserves some type of major award nom in the future i like how theyre developing her with robert dead lena played her lowkey last year but now shes able to unleash the verbal battles between her and tyrion are greatone burn after the next tyrion wins points for the funnybut cersei always goes in for the low blowsi like the idea that joff is the one who ordered the bastards killed on the show it seems like something hed be more inclined to dobecause hes a dickpod appearance dolorous edd and pod are lowkey saving the universeone scene at a time bronn as the head of the city watch took me by surprisebut this change makes sense not mad at the show for doing it beats introducing a new character who would just take up spacelittlefingers scene with ros makes up for the blasphemy that happened last week its time to build him back up to the devious force he is and the exclamation point on his assholery was the cum wipe"
"Fez",2012-04-08,"was one of the weakest episodes in the series thus far imo not because of the changes i dont care about that really its just that it felt disjointed and dragged on too much in the middle also and i say this for the first time ever there was far too much sex i was fine with stannismel scene although correct me if im wrong this is a change from the books yes i thought it was never clear if stannis had an affair or was seduced while asleep but the theoncaptains daughter scene dragged on even worse than it did on the page and the brothel scene was completely unnecessary i would much rather have preferred either another arya scene or some checking in with a character not in the episode maybe show joffrey being randomly cruel and stupid there were some definite great scenes of course tyrionslynt tyrioncersei davossaan theonbalon and aryagendry were all really good but they were surrounded by a lot that left a lot to be desired"
"Envie",2012-04-08,"can someone please summarize the scene with littlefinger and crying ros  im totally lost i have a hearing loss and even with headphones on and the sound cranked i could not quite make out the entire convo since he whispered the entire thing ugh frustrating who was the guy she was supposed to service and didnt whats the story littlefinger tells her about i got the gist of it that shes really upset about the murder of the baby and lf is telling her about another woman and thats the parts i couldnt hear right  would like hearing someone elses take on it edited by envie 08 april 2012  1121 pm"
"Ramsay Gimp",2012-04-08,"yea littlefinger was actually scary in this episode again thats a feeling i never got from him in the books but its better than coming off stupid like he did last week"
"Winter's Knight",2012-04-08,"i adored jaqen hgarand salladorprops to the pirate for stating he wouldnt rape cersei"
"sharkhawk",2012-04-08,"i think ashayara was perfectly cast read some people on other sites saying she wasnt beautiful enough to me she was perfect hot but with a tomboy kind of imperfect look real athletic looking the ship captains daughter was perfect too meh looking but not chubby enough and dumb as a box of rocks the roz scene could go i defended the role but now dont see the point bronn as city watch commander makes sense no reason for another character there also could live without having to show the melstan sex scene but i guess that is to explain the shadow killing of renly in the next ep or two im also not a big complainer about deviating from the book but i wonder how they are going to write the next episode after craster knocks out jon i cant see the watch leaving after craster brained him"
"sharkhawk",2012-04-08,"oh loved the sam and jacqen casting too and biter look great"

"HokieStone",2012-04-08,"i think this may be my least favorite episode of the entire series although it did have its high points as well  asha er yara  my first reaction is blah  she doesnt show the same fire that she shows in the books hopefully she grows on me  hated the littlefinger brothel scene hated it or at least the first part the voyeurism and the gag with wiping the whores face off and have her immediately kiss another man it again smacks of were on hbo well show this just because we can  stannis two episodes in and im not buying stannis yet personally i never suspected a stannismel tryst in the books but after seeing other comments i can look back and see that it was hinted at but the way it was done heremeh thats not stannis for me but its not just thati will have trouble fully explaining but he just doesnt fully act or talk like stannis to me for whatever reason what jumped out at me in this episode was when he called renly his little brother maybe its because to me little brother is most often used as a term of endearmentbut i just dont ever see stannis saying the words my little brother"
"Rockroi",2012-04-08,"so i am starting to have a significant issue with the disparate nature of the series its not that i cannot follow whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going on its that i cannot really enjoy whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going on before i can really enjoy tyrionstannisarya in their mortal danger we seem to jump to the next characterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mortal danger interspersed with this is the reality that much of what the characters are doing is still at the introduction level most notably the greyjoys and stannis with that as a backdrop here is what i likedarya i think aryaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s storyline is picking up well and staying true and straight in other words we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have much redirection away from the important stuff in the books we get the meat on the bone and not any fat and we still feel satisfied of all the parts of the story hers is the most even tyrion basically the best part of the book clash of kings remains the best part overall of season two of got tyrion is smart so fucking smart heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s selfaware as opposed to say ned who had no idea just how blind he was and confident all the while heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s enjoyable funny and bright his dialog with varys is not hard to follow but not really â<U+0080><U+009C>dumbeddownâ<U+0080><U+009D> from the book he is feisty and full of life power does not appear to be the chore it was to ned and the fact that tyrion references ned was a nice touch balon greyjoy i am stunned that i didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want to puncture my ear drum with his scenes balon greyjoy is one of my least favorite characters in one of my least favorite storylines but here is sounded more even and reasonable than he had in the book nicely done ghost oh good youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re still herejon and sam their scenes hold up really well sam is a much more complete character in the series than in the books jon is also very good he has a harder edge to him than book jon who was trying so hard not to outwardly appear like he wanted anything in the series samâ<U+0080><U+0099>s intelligence is not hampered by this need to show him as a coward he is a smart guy whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s intelligence has a good voice jon meanwhile is conflicted and brooding but it has a humanity not bad at all jury is still outstannis the priestess fucker again much like renly and the hound and â<U+0080><U+009C>sheaâ<U+0080><U+0099>daâ<U+0080><U+0099>funneeâ<U+0080><U+0099>horrâ<U+0080><U+009D> series stannis is different than book stannis and that takes getting used to in the book stannis was all iron he has this confident and determined stride to him he was impersonal but starkly determined and grim this stannis seems a lot more flaky and chittering like heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s trying to act tough but his name sounds less like â<U+0080><U+009C>stannisâ<U+0080><U+009D> and more like â<U+0080><U+009C>melvinâ<U+0080><U+009D> this stannis lacks that ironwill that brooked no compromise and even less confusion series stannis seems unsure vacillating and almost timid and the fact that book stannis was adamant about adultery makes his sweeping fuck of mel on the painted table to be a little offputting then again if that woman showed me that bodyâ<U+0080>the artificial cliffhanger i can understand why we had to catch craster throwing his kids to the others but why the lame cliffhanger zomg i wonder what happenedthe absence of robbbranjoffcatrenlyjaimesansa we didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see hide nor tail of like half the cast this episode and i really think that is a good thing the show needs to get tighter at the same time those characters are doing and seeing a lot that needs explanation and perhaps some items that we did not see in the books but that leads me inexoriably toâ<U+0080>what i did not likea tear for roz just stop the experiment has failed roz isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t working and in an episode where you could not find time for see above you found time for this ancillary character so we could see how upset she was and iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not saying the woman playing her is not the secondcoming of merril streep or anything but in a scene where the character is crying it would help if the character was actually crying anyway peter gets to tell us a story about what a hardass he is we knew that already what did this scene tell us not sure all i know is that its leading me to this new game we should play you know that web meme â<U+0080><U+0093> evil bert where bert pops up in pictures of osama bin laden and the jfk assassination and at klan rallies well i am wondering what the show will do next with roz where will she appear next will she be an astapor slaver will she vote for lord commander of the nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s watch will she be in oldtown seriously where will this completely disposable character end up next overall it was a very fragmented episode wherein every scene felt like it should have gone on longer or had more in it and where nothing felt connected or integrated it was not bad but it was somewhat forgettable"
"The Red Lamb Chop",2012-04-08,"i think the point of the stannismel sex scene was so that when mel gives birth to her stannis shadow baby thing its not gonna be a well how did that get there moment like when people ask what the heck how is mel giving birth to that theyll be able to point back and be like aha you see when mel told stannis she would give him a son and he impregnated her in what was to me a very awkward sexscene she actually meant that demonic thing was the son so all in all she does give him a son its just not humanspeaking of stanniss heir was i the only one saddened by the confirmation of shireens nonexistence"
"Ser Hippie",2012-04-08,"liked this episode a lot apart from a couple of scenes lfros  just felt unnecessary and id rather have spent time elsewhere ashayara seemed a bit off to me but im not too bothered loved sallador i also enjoyed one recap where the reviewer who didnt know his name referred to him as salad or sandwich balon was nailed perfectly the tyrionvarys tyrionjanos and tyrioncersei scenes were fantastic as well especially when you see tyrion realizing the mess hes stuck in aryagendry was done well and im glad to see yorens translated well to the screen as im a big fan of him in the books edited by ser hippie 08 april 2012  1133 pm"
"Dark14",2012-04-08,"i figured ashayara would be better looking to why would they kill rhakaro to he is kinda needed why not just recast him if thats the issue i mean he had like two lines in season one who would have noticed kinda pod at that same with stannismel isnt the whole thing with stannis that he always does the right thing no matter if its hard now he just looks like a man to go out whoring with robert and mel looks a whore instead of priestess"

"TeemuOfHouseSelanne",2012-04-08,"was that definitely rhakaro he doesnt play a huge role in the books but as dance progressed grrm seemed to be building him up for some sort of queensguardtype position or something i saw a version without dothraki subtitles so im not totally clued in tyionslynt is one of my favorite moments and i thought the show nailed it bronn taking over the goldcloaks can only be considered a plus his relationship with tyrion was one of the best parts of season 1 and this just allows for more bronn then we would have had while not affecting how his character arc plays out balon was damn near perfect asha had the tude but maybe not the look davos never really speaks allowed about his support for the seven in the books rather keeping those thoughts to himself so i have no problem with how the show is approaching his beliefs especially because the casting choice was damn near perfect excited to see marg and brienne next week also just wanted to touch on the stannismel bangfest i think its one of the few instances where hbo actually succesfully uses sex to help the plot along while reading it didnt occur to me that stannis was actually banging mel till she offered it up to davos it may have really confused a tv audience when mel has a stannis shadow baby later on speaking on mel thats exactly how i pictured her great casting call edited by teemuofhouseselanne 08 april 2012  1143 pm"

"Dr. Pepper",2012-04-09,"i was disgusted by the theon and ashayara scene in a way that i never was with jaime and cersei maybe its because ive already developed sort of a pity for theon i seriously wanted to wash my eyes out with lye as i was watching it im not sold on the actor playing asha she lacked that spunk book asha has im very surprised with how explicit they are being with things that are only hinted at in the books i know grrm works closely with the show so i wonder if hes giving a silent nod to all of the theorizing that goes on in the forums or if the producers are just using their own theories i mean its hinted enough times that stannis and mel have done the dirty but we are never really sure there have been some amazing theories about what craster does with his sons and giving them to the others is not one that i bought into i wish i knew if we can use the show to learn more about the books i reread parts of the books dealing with the killing of the bastards this past week and i found that its never really stated that cersei is the one who ordered it slynt said it was orders but never mentions the queen the only time anyone says it was cersei was tyrion and varys only agreed that it was a terrible thing so it could have been joffrey since it was done around the same time that joff found out about the incest rumors i really like who they cast as jaqen i had imagined him as a slimy creepy man the scene was great still i wish arya had brought him some water pyke looked amazing balon was amazing i was not sold on ashayara she didnt have any spunk i was disgusted with the theonyara scene in a way i never was with jaimecersei maybe its because i have already developed a pity for theon after reading so much about what the future holds for him maybe it was just because the actress playing yara wasnt very good i had been defending ros inclusion on the show but im losing faith i cant figure out what they are building her up for im not entirely sure what that entire scene was even supposed to be telling us about littlefinger it starts out with him spying on his whoresare his whores his spiesthen turns disgusting when he wipes semen from a whores mouth and then watches her kiss a patron with that same mouth then he goes on to threaten ros all of his previous scenes have already showed us that hes a player in the games and that he has no problem playing dirty so what new were we supposed to learn dolorous edd made me laugh so hard that i spewed dr pepper from my nose it hurt i had to clean my nose up rewind and watch again just so i could laugh properly i didnt appreciate his character in the books because i couldnt quite understand the dour nature he was supposed to have the show makes me appreciate his comic value"
"Lordtoofat2sitAthrone",2012-04-09,"asha was ok i wasnt really taken in by the actor but they didnt keep the whole scene balon kinda reffered to her and she made a joke about theons garb and earlier on horseback she just kinda let theon play with her while he brags she didnt come off as a swaggering confident type  wishing she had been born a man like cersei but she really didnt leave an impression im a little miffed about the cliffhanger and i dont understand it how hard would it have been for gilly to have said he gives our sons to the gods leaving it a mystery to the viewer as to exactly what that means if someone can explain this decision to me please do im not a purist by any stretch changes for expediency or because of budget limitation or time constraints is fine but that ticked me off where is patchface where is this dynamic between queens men and kings men where are the reeds im not upset about the damphair because he can be omitted without any great loss untill the events of the 4th book i think this is the start of some serious deviation not thats necessarily a bad thing i remember an interview with the showrunners that said each season wont so much tell the story of the book but when its viewed as a whole will tell the story of asoiaf which im fine with"
"Mark Antony",2012-04-09,"this was a decent episode i enjoyed the north remembers more though  jaqen was pretty good i liked him rorge and biter were okay not really what i pictured at all but iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll live yoren was bad ass as fuck in the opening scene his death is going to suck hope its epic i liked gendry a lot as well arya scenes were definitely highlights this episode cant stand shae i just dont get why they changed the character so much and why is she staying in the tower of the hand enjoyed varystyrion going at it though  loved the tyrionjanos scene even though it was ten times better in the books i get why they made bronn the lord commander of the city watch i was hoping to see jacelyn bywater but no big deal  ghost looked fucking awesome  so which blood rider did they kill off didnt like that change honestly geez i hate theon just as much on the show as i did when i was reading clash not how i pictured asha yara but whatever i was actually happy with the ironborn scenes thought balon was perfect  littlefingerros mehhhh i just dont like what they did with littlefinger and i hate ros so  davos is the man salladhor saan was casted perfectly imo great scene king stannis is my god  not really mad that they pinned king roberts bastards murders on joffrey and really enjoyed the cerseityrion scene  im sold on stannis already really like the casting surprised by him and mellisandre just straight up fucking but i guess they got to make shadow babies somehow no shireen i dont see why they cut her out  i get they wanted to show what craster does with his sons but they couldve handled it much better imo i could barely even tell that what picked the baby up until i saw the blue eyes but i think they could have made it clearer that it was a white walker and craster finding jon and hitting him upside the head idk just didnt like how much this episode differed from the books  no robb catelyn sansa renly jaime tywin etc this is probably one of my least favorite episodes of the entire series but still enjoyed it a lot solid 7"

"Lord Belmore",2012-04-09,"it was good as usual but ill nitpick a bit my three biggest issues with the episode 1 crasterjon cliffhanger this feels really out of place and im curious to see how they resolve this i suppose it doesnt have to harm anything important jeor can die any number of ways without much loss the crasterothers reveal still occurs if they do it properly this could quickly become a nonissue but it just shocked me somewhat 2 as almost everyone has noted yaraasha really lacked the spice that made the character jump out in the books i dont care about her appearance and very well would have expected her not to be comely but the personality simply has not made the jump to the screen 3 im still also sad about patchface and shireen apparently being out the dragonstone scenes had such a creepy atmosphere in the books and they were part of it thankfully i dont see any of these mattering too much going forward shae is annoying but that will just make a certain moment that much better also was i the only one kind of glad when rakharo died simply because they scared me into thinking theyd stick him in as a love interest for daenerys based on the previous episode"
"Frumpus",2012-04-09,"i dont see why anyone cares that rakharo died he barely plays a role in the series as a whole and his characterrole is easily expendablereplaceable sallador saan being black only bugs me because the only reason hes black is because the series was overdue for some ethnic diversity so hes the token black guy personally i still think they should have just had jalabhar xho appearing in the background"
"aimlessgun",2012-04-09,"so much awesome little stuff in the episode and it flowed together pretty well too so many actors knocking it out of the park its funny talking about how ros is wasting our time again but it occurs to me that the dany section was just as much a waste of time and im not a dany hater though i guess if rakharos actor had to leave the show they did have to give him a sendoff"
"CloudFlare",2012-04-09,"loved it the change in joffreys actions are believable and show his malicious naturedidnt like the rakharo thing one bit something tells me that he still would have had a role to play past adwd maybe now they can bring jogoi loved how they showed his death it was nice from a viewing perspective and a reader of the books perspective from a viewing perspective it was clever how the horse came out of the mirage from a reader perspective it threw in a nice curveball i was suspecting that one of her blood riders would return with emissaries of the location of the ghost city bronn as city watch commander makes sense no reason for another character thereyep it also makes more sense for tyrion to put someone loyal to himself in chargei found greyjoys sex scene a bit more disturbing tho for some unknown reasonit was a lot like the early danydrogo love scene the women are powerless in the scenes and whether they enjoy the physical act or not is highly debatable"

"HannibalStark",2012-04-09,"was one of the weakest episodes in the series thus far imo not because of the changes i dont care about that really its just that it felt disjointed and dragged on too much in the middle also and i say this for the first time ever there was far too much sex i was fine with stannismel scene although correct me if im wrong this is a change from the books yes i thought it was never clear if stannis had an affair or was seduced while asleep but the theoncaptains daughter scene dragged on even worse than it did on the page and the brothel scene was completely unnecessary i would much rather have preferred either another arya scene or some checking in with a character not in the episode maybe show joffrey being randomly cruel and stupidthere were some definite great scenes of course tyrionslynt tyrioncersei davossaan theonbalon and aryagendry were all really good but they were surrounded by a lot that left a lot to be desirednot so sure mel and stannis getting it on is a change from the booksi always got the feeling there was something going on kinda like with renly and loras on tv it needs to be much more direct than the way its alluded to in the books"

"LuisDantas",2012-04-09,"i liked stannis depiction so far in the series while i seem to be in a minority it is clear to me that stannis is not any kind of moral reference although davos and himself see him as such stannis has time and again shown a lot of moral shortcomings not least of all deep hypocrisy and the tv series seems to understand that perfectly incidentally i have often wondered why davos is so loyal to him am i the only one wondering if the episode wanted to hint of a homosexual attraction to stannis with that talk about he being his god"
"dtones520",2012-04-09,"i didnt have a problem with stannis banging mel on screen but how the scene was arranged was somewhat ridiculous and inflicted major damage to stannis cool he should have been much more reluctant about it in a nonpassionate quicklyperformhisduty kinda way which would have been even more awesome because of how eyefriendly mel actually isto me it was very much like stannis doing his duty he didnt want to at first mel touched on how his wife sucked and couldnt produce him an heir and left it ambiguous as to whether or not shireen was alive i think she probably put some sort of spell on him that or just being super hot brought up the son and got stannis on board with doing it he knows his ultimate duty is to take the iron throne if banging mel helps him do that well so be it then he actually does it and it is the worst sex scene possible seems like he was 23 pumps and was done and he sounded totally ackward when he did it with his gross grunts"

"duncanthemedium",2012-04-09,"let me begin by saying that i rated the episode a solid 8 i will reserve the 10 for the blackwater episode which i think would be awesome to see i want to address what i view as a recurring problem for the bookloyalists i have said this before we must be able to see the tv show as its own thing and as such it has a slightly different discourse on power i think even from the preseason that dealing with power is the theme of the season the books are such an expansive and limitless medium of discourse that grrm is able to comment on a plethora of ways of handling power the tv series needs by the necessity of the medium to converge on a discourse a unity of opinion towards which actions happening on different continents and in different kingdoms can climax towards i think there is also with characters like ros and the girl on the boat and the arya storyline a hint towards some kind of a class politics remember these are not players of the game of thrones but pawns albeit with their own agency and limits of operation in that sense both the stannis scene and the roslf scene works beautifully look at how we hear and like different renditions of classic songs by new artists they all bring in a bit of their own to the material even though the structure of the song the lyrics the music is essentially the same this tv adaptation works in exactly the same way and the symphony they play is a sweet one indeed"

"Kaitscralt",2012-04-09,"i thought this episode was one of the shows weakest if not the weakest  yet i still enjoyed it very much i am going to randomly list my observations and pros and cons things i liked 1 character performances  lena and peter continue to steal the shows best scenes but i also thought basically the entire cast had a great episode the greyjoys were all great as well as the nights watch the kings road crew varys and many more 2 stannis  dragonstone crew  i am far less worried about shireen and selyse than others here nor am i finding stannis to be any less badass and stern the sex scene was handled fine he gave in to a beautiful naked sorceress as any warmblooded male would i dont know how stannis morals are being judged when we know he is days away from having his brother murdered which is one of the greatest sins on the westeros morality scale plus he scarcely seemed to even be enjoying the seduction just watch how he kisses her and those noises he makes it was all incredibly awkward as it should have been side note davos scene was just perfect 3 giving joffrey and robb a break  thank you its time to slow things down whenever possible 4 ghost  enough said 5 varys  i so loved his exchange with tyrion i like that the show is making threats more blatant even if it makes the characters seem a bit more dim the way varys held the door shut with a finger after tyrion used his whole hand was awesome plus they kept in the great oceanfishpaddling analogy he recognizes that tyrion is a bigger threat than anyone else in kings landing so he is making it known that he is the top dog 6 aryas scene was pure gold gendry looks different to me than he did in the forge and it keeps distracting me maybe it is the lack of sweat and smithy outfit or maybe the actor has grown up a bit i still loved everything about this scene including jaqen things i didnt like 1 how the writers handled the yaratheon exchange  in the books she is clearly messing with him moving his hands away and finally after revealing herself making him very embarassed on the show a lot of nonbook readers are going to think she is really creepy and incestous while alfies facial expression conveyed his disgust perfectly afterwards i do think maybe a line or two could have been added to make yara seem just a bit less gross i love the way she looks though  gritty and tomboyish with a sex appeal underneath it all the idea of a perfect 1010 beauty queen swinging two axes around and winning the loyalty of barbarians always seemed fake to me this woman is one who looks like she has killed 2 cutting from a ship sex scene to a brothel sex scene  really bizarre choice of editing here didnt work at all for me i also found the littlefinger spying to be a bit confusing and unnecessary i hate thinking are the nonreaders going to be thinking this random nobleman is important otherwise i did like littlefingers creepiness and scariness the scene was a bit long but i liked showing what a sociopath he is 3 the red waste of time  poor daenerys and jorah really have nothing to do for a while not the writers faults but if we dont need to see robb sitting in the woods we dont need to see daenerys sitting in the sand more swearing vengeance promising blood blah blah 4 jon getting bonked by crastor  im not sure why this isnt sitting well with me as i dont mind the other changes involved in this story line or maybe i just hate cliffhangers i like jon giving in to his emotions and charging into the woods with his sword drawn i need to see what happens obviously but i do think ghost should be around  also i continue to be unbothered by character development changes and things like bronn over bywater this is a separate entitiy from the novelization"

"Lord Varys",2012-04-09,"in my opinion this episode shows us why it was a huge mistake to downplay selyse truly why is stannis even married if this woman did not give him an heir and shireen cant be cut stannis may not be dead at the end of adwd but he is supposed to be dead shireen will be declared queen so whats going to happen in the tv series if they ever reach that point they have to give us shireen back the girl is as important as tommen and myrcella she may have littleno screen time but her existence is important politically as to the sex scene i dont mind it nor do i mind the setting stannis baratheon cannot be as opposed to sex as his appearance makes us believe but i do not believe that mel could seduce stannis by promising him a son nor do i believe that he longed this desperately for a son if he did he would have sex with selyse on a regular basis as king stannis would be able to legitimize his bastard son by mel true but would he do this if stannis never got an child from selyse would he not rather put his wife aside divorce her and take melisandre as his new queen i think he would so this does not make any sense at all there is a love story between stannis and mel but this only begins after the blackwater before that stannis saw mel only as means to an end ie the iron throne she was his red falcon afterwards she really started to comfort him and the line in adwd strongly indicates that stannis spends his nights with melisandre on a regular basis apparently you can have sex with that woman and not making shadow babies  but even then stannis is never under her thumbin her thrall he outright threatened to kill her in asos during the edric storm business he would have done it if they had ended up sacrificing him without the promised results the better thing would have been to play the religiousroyal card promising stannis that by laying with her the lord of light would give him what he wanted ie the iron throne and justice also with selyse as devoted follower of melisandre we would have gotten a rather interesting dynamic here as i see it its quite likely that selyse encouraged stannis to have sex with melisandre because its gods will making all of stanniss followers rhllorians and matthos seaworth the only talking face of them lead to that stupid dialogue about religion and atheism between stannis and his son davos only said that stannis was his god to axell florent if im not mistaken because he was afraid that they would consider still a follower of the seven but matthos never would report davos to melstannis so this whole stuff seemed quite out of place to me they also gave the first chance away to have salladhor saan tell us about the original azor ahai and nissa nissa telling this story is one of the main purposes of salladhor saan in the books so i really think they missed an opportunity here as to littlefinger and ros completely pointless spying and whores and customers alike further makes littlefinger a moron the man does not care about sex he only cares about money influence and power sure owning brothels and spying on customers can give him leverage over them but he would not do this personally the man is head of the royal treasury he has work to do as for ros i simply do not care i dont see where she is going from here nor do i care i just found this scene a waste of time we already knew littlefinger is an ass so what was the point i also dont like the joffreycerseichange joff is not that much older in the series and since adulthood starts at the age of 18 not 16 joffrey should be as far from being a man grown in the series as he was in the books the regent rules the king does not considering cerseis personality she would not back down this easily nor should seriesjoffrey have the cunning to circumvent his mother giving slynt an order is not the same thing than diverging from the script in public cersei and the council had real difficulties to countermand joffs order of executing ned but the whole thing makes cersei a stupid whining mother but its somewhat coherent with joffs character he would do this and its not that unbelievable that he would have heard talk about roberts various affairs and his bastard brothers killing them is the right thing to do after stannis sent out his letters the rest pyke asha balon and the captains daughter the kingsroad arya gendry jaqen hot pie and especially lommy id yield were really great not sure about the jon scene in the end though hundreds of nw men slept around crasters keep that night would craster risk to slip out to deliver a boy to the others i dont think so"

"theMountainGoat",2012-04-10,"perhaps my experience of episode 2 was coloured by the fact that i was in a pub with 30 other fans and sat three feet away from george rr martin but i think id still think this was a brilliant episode had i been on my own at home so many of the scenes used dialogue straight out of the book and everything looked great especially pyke i definitely prefer it when some characters are left out so the show can put a greater focus on the storylines they are following that week it works so much better i was surprised there was no renly this week but im sure there will be a big chunk of his story in episode 3 the only thing i didnt really like was the whole yaraasha thing but we knew about that long ago and its already been argued to death the gratuitous sex was gratuitous but is fast becoming the norm for this show i did not mind the roslittlefinger scene this week to be honest because we saw a different side to her character which felt like the right choice for her although i do think its a little incongruous with the previous episode where she appeared to have become the madam of the brothel and now she is back to being just another whore i think making bronn the captain of the goldcloaks is actually a really interesting change i was surprised because i thought that jacelyn bywater had been cast but perhaps i am mistaken it does make me wonder if they are going to keep bronn around instead of having him disappear off to stokeworth but hes such a great character i dont think id mind if they do go that way also im glad they kept in the line about how much since that tells you everything you ever need to know about bronn the end of the episode was so awesome i cant believe that scene wasnt in the book the absence of the others in the second book has always been a strange choice and for the tv show we definitely needed that reminder that the white walkers are still out there i got chills when i heard the ice cracking language echoing through the trees and the visual of the white walker picking up the baby and walking away was creepy and beautiful it will be interesting to see how they handle jon snow waking up next week will they have already left crasters when he awakes in a litter or will he awake in the midst of craster and mormont arguing if i had one complaint about it id say the fact that they had not established that there was a newborn baby son in the household when the nights watch arrived made it seem like the baby came out of nowhere just one line about a pregnant daughter about to give birth or gilly saying something about her sister giving birth to a son yesterday might have helped with that and yes ghost looked awesome overall it really was a fantastic episode a great improvement on the first episode which i thought was awkward and had some poorly thought out ideas i know george liked it and was happy to see so many fans enjoying it in person he had already seen the first two episodes before they aired so we did not get to see any reaction from him as he watched but george has not seen any of the other episodes yet im not sure if he will be able to watch episode 3 when he is in portugal next week but if anyone finds him in a bar watching it you may get to see his reaction although i suspect he may wait till he gets back home before watching it"

"ace",2012-04-10,"i feel like people are making too big of a deal about the stannismelisandre sex scene implied or shown it changes nothing because it happens in both instances some people have said that it make stannis look like a hypocrite  and well he was stannis had a mistress on the sides in the books in the form of melisandre while he chastised robert for being a manwhore and banned brothels on dragonstonebook stannis never had a mistress he had an allyservantguide in melisandre but nowhere is a sexual relationship said or even impliedand i actually thought the show did a great job showing that it wasnt stannis just being horny when mel stripped down that didnt make him lust for her it was after she mentioned being able to produce a son that he acted we all know that stannis is an honorable man and that was not changed by showing him having sex with melisandre as it wasnt shown as a complete act of lustbook stannis is portrayed as someone completely not interested in sex beyond producing an heir melisandre wouldnt even try to seduce him not only that hes also married which means he has a duty and an obligation to his wife and you know how he feels about duty so hes not only not someone who would be interested in sex for sexs sake or desire it so wouldnt be seduced easily hes someone for whom duty honor his vows and obligations are above any personal desires he might haveand that 20 second feigning resistance to her it wouldnt even be believable as playing hard to getalso babies have to be made somehow and to just show melisandre giving birth to a shadow baby without ever really explaining wth happened would not make for a clear plotexactly babies are made this way but mel never had any babies the shadows are some sort of dark magic its never said that they require an actual sexual intercourse to create much less with stannis in fact iirc its implied that stannis doesnt even know that mel is behind these assassinations only that she sees them in the flames and then they happenand now that mel seduces him with the promise of a son what happens is she lying or misleading him that would also be completely against her character or is she actually going to give birth to a son and theyll be a happy family that would be even worseps i finished reading asos so perhaps there is something in the next books i dont yet know but the show is still in the beginning of acok and so far this particular arc is straying far from the book"

"Vikingkingq",2012-04-10,"because the stannis scene is out of character just like anyone does out of character things stannis sleeping with mel both in the books and in the show is out of character for him my point was that in the book grrm makes it clear that such a thing is out of character given that its never even mentioned explicitly we assume it happened but his character is one of stern adherence to law and justice and all thatin the show by giving that scene such prominence its not very clear that its out of character for him yeah he puts up token resistancefor all of like 20 seconds i understand the show has to make some sacrifices in order to provide context for later occurrences but to me it seems like theyre sacrificing much of stanniss character and thats too high a price spoiler im no show creator but i would have preferred that mels shadowspawn would have been some summoned thing that didnt require pregnancy and the relationship between them could have been developed more slowly and allowed stanniss uncompromising nature to assert itself before he gives in it is absolutely mentioned explicitly and it is therefore in character given that it happened stannis slept with melisandre he did it before the meeting at storms end she gave birth to a shadowbabystannis character is about his adherence to law and justice  not to honor hes not ned stark hes incredibly pragmatic and ruthless about the means to his ends hes willing to forgive people he considers to be traitors to get their bannermen hes willing to use rhllorblood magic to kill off the pretenders to his throne im not referring to renly here fyi even if that possibly means the death of edric storm his own kinwhat makes stannis stannis is that he is a man poised on the absolute edge of heroism and villainy whether he allows his resentment and sense of entitlement to push him into becoming the new nights king or whether he listens to his better angels in the form of davos and decides to stake his claim by defending the realmand im sorry ace but its quite explicit that hes sleeping with melisandre she shared his tent during the campaign melisandre herself confirms that she slept with him to produce the shadowbabies which davos recognizes as stannis shadows and wore him out so to speak when we get her viewpoint chapters later onhe doesnt do so to get a son if you rewatch the scene its very clear  stannis says he cant win without renlys army melisandre says shes seen a path to victory in the flames but that he has to give all of himself to the lord of light stannis thinks shes talking about the words she makes it clear shes talking about sex only then does she bring up the sons issue to get him over the issue of cheating on his wife"

"ScientistGirl26",2012-04-13,"was one of the weakest episodes in the series thus far imo not because of the changes i dont care about that really its just that it felt disjointed and dragged on too much in the middle also and i say this for the first time ever there was far too much sex i was fine with stannismel scene although correct me if im wrong this is a change from the books yes i thought it was never clear if stannis had an affair or was seduced while asleep but the theoncaptains daughter scene dragged on even worse than it did on the page and the brothel scene was completely unnecessary i would much rather have preferred either another arya scene or some checking in with a character not in the episode maybe show joffrey being randomly cruel and stupidi agree with everything you said i could have lived without having seen theon greyjoy finger his sister on the horse he is a losersex scenes in the brothel were a complete unnecessary soft porn material and while were at it  producers can you throw in some athletic looking young men in here and show their asses women watch this show too you knowwhen stannis and melisandre were having sex i couldnt stop thinking about how those little figurines on the table must have poked melisandres back anyone elserakharos death  i knew it was coming but man oh man the first time i saw him in episode 3 of the first series my jaw dropped and i was like who is this where what how saliva all over the place but seriously he was one of the best characters in the show edited by scientistgirl26 13 april 2012  0846 am"

"Loras",2012-04-09,"i am going to give this episode an 810 i thought that the episode was great with a number of excellent character building scenes but was still setting up the core of the season the good i loved the subtle handling of some of the characters in this episode a particular stand out for me was building samâ<U+0080><U+0099>s character he was a thinly drawn character in the first season a sidekick for jon snow who gave him advice but here for the first time he gets an opportunity to shine i love what jon bradley does with the character and i enjoy the changes that dd have made particularly in reference to girls the moment that gilly called sam brave was one of those few heart warming episodes that reminds us that this world is very human i also challenge those people struggling with the adaptation to knock the way that sam is portrayed a second example is the relationship between davos and stannis the scene where davos and matthos are discussing religion and gods is fantastic this small scene has done wonders for the entire dragonstone storyline and i feel now as though i understand the respect that davos has for his king liam cunningham is hitting it out of the park with the role of davos the entire arya arc in this episode was a joy to watch unfolding on the screen at first i was concerned that there would be little payoff to the cliffhanger from â<U+0080><U+009C>the north remembersâ<U+0080><U+009D> but again this story was filled with nuance and all of the actors involved were brilliant the scene with yoren and the goldcloaks was also a touch of class and i look forward to seeing where this story will go from here kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s landing was stellar once again peter dinklage continues to impress as tyrion lannister i could rave about those scenes all day the brothel scene was a stroke of genius in my opinion the writers really show two things with this scene the first is another window into the character of petyr baelish we know now how petyr rose so high in court he is ruthless and manipulative it was good to see another facet of the character the second aspect showed how some of the common people feel about the way that the gold cloaks massacre of the bastards is affecting public opinion much better that the previous littlefingerros scene the bad i am missing catelyn this season i noticed in the discussions of the previous episode that people were complaining that ros has had more screentime than dany well what about catelyn i am looking forward to catching up on her story soon overall i feel that this episode continues to set up the rest of the seasonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s arc but i thought that the montage at the end of â<U+0080><U+009C>the north remembersâ<U+0080><U+009D> would kickstart the season in a similar way to the final scene of â<U+0080><U+009C>cripples bastards and broken thingsâ<U+0080><U+009D> but i was wrong this was a slower episode that builds up the fantastic characters of the series adding more layers to each of them the end of the episode fell flat for me but i am looking forward to seeing where we go from here"

"DornishSnake",2012-04-09,"i understand the problems people are having with the show but 4 seems excessively low the show has to be different from the books simply because of the limitations of the medium and whats wrong with the melstannis scene the books make it pretty clear that she has sex with him and as far as nudity goes iirc every sex scene except ros was either directly or indirectly in the books and iirc sex often involves nudity and imo ros is a good necessary addition to the show but lets not get into thatwhats wrong with the stannis scene well lets see his entire character is based on him being this slave to duty and virtue and in one of our first scenes with him hes an oathbreaker to his wife cheating on her because shes sick remember when john edwards did that really screams a persons of honour and dutysecond  how he did it a spur of the moment decision again simply screams stannis and worse a spur of the moment decision clearly driven by temptation selfishness and  if im being generous  a bloodlust for power giving him an heirwho is this characterso regardless  even if stannis had sex is the book with her it wouldnt have been anything like this couldnt have beenbut third and most important the book is not clear that they had sex at all you wonder you consider you debate with your friends theres some mysetery therethere is no mystery in the hbo series ever everything is constantly being smashed over your head like the viewers are idiotsthis excuse about medium differences is also getting old there have been great multideminsional suspenseful complicated plots and characters in tv battlestar gallactica bill adama and basically every character on the show most characters from lost deadwood the wiregame of thrones the tv show and its characters dont stand up to any of those shows in a story that was based on mystery and complicated characters every bit of mystery and every complicated part of a character is being systematically removed there was no reason for that stannis scene had nothing to do with medium changes the only reason its in there is because hbo thinks it would get higher ratings if stannis has hot passionate sex scenes with a hot wizard rather than if he didnt the fact that stannis the character would never have a hot sex scene  and certainly not on the spur of the moment  doesnt matter this character is not stannis and hbo doesnt carelast the dialogue why is there so much of it nonstop chatter where is a bit of silence where its just the camera and a character where their face shows what theyre thinking or better yet you wonder what theyre thinking in the cersei and tyrion scenes those great actors have the good sense to at least pause in between sentences in the others its just rapid fire back and forth endlessly for the hour i dont blame them the writers have given the task of conveying everything by words nothing by facial expressions or emotionis there ever going to be a scene that can compare with bill adama crying alone in his quarters a scene that can compare with any of the lost characters having a moment to themselves where you dont know what theyre thinking but want more than ever to find out will hbo ever give us a scene like that like heck they will even though george gave them a raodmap to many scenes like that and better in the booksand dont tell me theres too much story to get through there is also no rule that hbo had to do an entire book in one season they couldve developed the plot far more than they have look how slowly lost was developed look how slowly george developed this story in the books the books arent thousands of pages for georges good health they are thousands of pages because all good stories especially this one must be told at a certain pacehere here theon is tasked to go to his fathers to get reinforcements and is there 5 minutes later with his answer in hand 0 suspense was able to build in that time an outrage the hbo show feels like point form notes where getting through the plot is more a mechanical chore for the writers than a joy and the audience can feel itthe first book alone could have and perhaps should have taken several tv seasons instead hbo handcuffs themselves by trying to tell a 1000 page book in 10 episodes then complains they have to tell the story poorly because they were handcuffed its their own fault theyre handcuffed how can it be an excuse why do people buy that excusefrankly i was embarassed by this episode i havent liked the hbo series at all so far but this episode i didnt know what i story was watching and didnt like it an emabarassing disaster if id never read the books this is the type of story i wouldve laughed at so simple no subtely whatsover even dare i say predictable each and every time they stray from georges plot oh let me guess the hot female wizard gets a sex scene with the kingthe execution of the story is brutal and apart from the imp and the queen all other characters have been dumbeddown so much that they are no longer interesting stannis practically got a labotomy what a tragedy and this is just the beginning edited by dornishsnake 09 april 2012  0940

"Seed",2012-04-09,"oh yeah and they killed off rhakkaro that i didnt see coming or expect guess we shoulda seen that coming from their interaction in last weeks episode"
"Chelly",2012-04-09,"i gave it a 910 i really liked it and i thought it was better than the last episode im very excited to see how theon is handled and i want more jaqen already"
"bloodymime",2012-04-09,"eight out of ten first ros scene i didnt dislike the voyeurism is a good way to hammer home that this is the game of thrones theres always somebody watching and most like someone is watching the watcher as well plus nothing says creepy like delivering that kind of threat in such a comforting tone nights watch was great lommy already wanting to yield ha biter wasnt what youd want to see but oh well stannis has been a letdown from the start when hes writing his letter of declaration and comes off to me as someone discussing what to have for breakfast i understand the limitations of casting but he is an actor lets see a little more grinding of the teeth and clenching of the jaw ive gotten used to it though as just about every single fighter in the series has come across as baked out hippies to me instead of warriors and hard men jon and caster was interesting i dont mind the changes ive read the books and like being left wondering a little what will happen next pyke was awesome good ratings for that alone always liked the ironmen and hopefully they introduce cleftjaw in the series and do him justice"
"Giskard Reventlov",2012-04-09,"gave it 7 because i love the books wouldve been lower ashayara is terribly casted where did they find that fat girl with baby  plump face i hoped that promo pics ere wrong but  alas as the stupid name change wasnt enough there were some good and bad casting choices on the show ie meliasndre was also casted poorly but compared with this ungodly abomination she looks almost good thing i hate most wih book adaptations is not when they omit or add parts but when they change nature of characters by changing the parts of the book like in lotr in season 1 they used those little changes to show us something about the character that is in the book but what could not be put in a show however i dont know to what end is all this melisnadrestanis  cerceilittlefinger  tyrionspider scenes so far i dont see what does this changes add to the story ps i hope at least that they make another change and kill that terrible ashayara so i dont have to look at her fat face anymore"
"Reposado",2012-04-09,"i liked this week a lot better than last week people will complain about the unnecessary sex scene but the dragonstone stuff was handled much better this week and theon and arya both went on nice journeys establishing the iron islands as a setting and a culture and introducing us to the messiness that will become the riverlands for now i think they did a nice job with gendry and lommy and hot pie has been fantastic and of course saan very well done there edited by baelorbreakspear 09 april 2012  1208 pm"

"TeamDanyArya",2012-04-09,"im going to try and post this again since the website crashed on me before i posted banggif classbbcemoticon altbang  anyway i gave it a 7 i think they rushed theons homecoming just a bit too much i wanted a bit more tension there or the scene to be a bit longer my husband was disappointed at how homely asha excuse me yara was we were both expecting a bit more of a hottie but im more interested in the character as a whole i pointed out that greyjoys didnt strike me as particularly goodlooking in the book so i could do without any more scenes in lfs brothel i did actually like ros this week since she got to be more human and it showed lf as a wannabe maifa boss they could have done without the whole lf watching a dude watching ros just lf watching ros would have been okay and i could have done without the mouthwiping i think my favorite scenes were tyrion with cersei and tyrion with varys you see just how much cersei hates tyrion and always and how much that hurts him even though he tried to not show that her varys and tyrion are intersting together because it shows how varys is truly looking out for the realm lf and him have that conversation back in season 1 about how they both are only looking out for the realm but this season and in the books as well you are shown that lf really is only looking out for himself and how to acquire more power varys isnt about acquiring power for himself necessarily arya and gendry was good i like gendry because he just wants to be left alone to be a blacksmith if he ever found out about who his father is i dont think hed care he certainly wouldnt make a play for the throne ghost looked awesome i want the direwolves in action though i want to see grey wind in battle with robb and ghost and jon need to be seen more together jons scene was a little rough for me him running through the woods was off and i cant remember if it was in the book or not acok was the one book i cant remember much about mel and stannis was fine for me i didnt mind their sex scene since it is implied by davos and jon that mel and stannis got it on i think the casting of stannis is growing on me hes awkward in the book and i think the actor is doing a good job of that i think the line about giving him a son was put in there because it doesnt seem like they will be having shireen in the show"
"Tadco26",2012-04-09,"my least favorite episode so far it started well with arya though i thought she was more provoking than defensive with her stick on rorge the books have biter lurch thru the bars and try to grab her which prompts her to hit him with her stick in the show it comes more like a kid poking at a barking dog in a cage not a big deal but not as good a scene as it could have been i liked yorenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s interaction with the gold cloaks though originally the came with they queenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s orders the second arya scene didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t sit as well with me how ever gendry doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t figure out she is a girl nor does she share her true identity until after yorenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death and doing it before hand felt a bit forced the acting was good but it would have been more natural if it played out in the original time line instead of so soon even one more episode delay would have been worth while tyrion shae and varys scene is very good overall i am still puzzled at tyrion keeping shae in the tower of the hand though a big part of his problems at court are keeping shae secret not being willing to take her inside the castle and having to sneak out to see her it also pretty much eliminates the idea that maybe ros will be alaya or chataya as there is no need for the character if shae isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t being kept in hiding in the first place maybe she will in the future but itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to believe that all the spies in kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s landing wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know about shae by then but beyond that point the scene was well acted and i enjoyed it great considering i disliked season 1 shae the council meeting where cersei tears up robâ<U+0080><U+0099>s offer went fine nothing particularly bad or good tyrion and janos slyntâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scene played out well and i didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t mind bronn being named captain of the city watch i hate joffrey ordering the killing of robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bastards instead of cersei and tyrion implying that she was worried the bastards might have a claim as the reason she wanted them killed was also silly two hands had already figured out cersei and jamieâ<U+0080><U+0099>s secret based in large part from seeing these bastards and the danger was even higher after stannis sent the letters making the story public rumor joffrey would have been much more likely to kill anyone who spread the â<U+0080><U+009C>liesâ<U+0080><U+009D> than to kill robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bastards as he believed himself to be robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s son crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s keep dolorous eddâ<U+0080><U+0099>s fart joke fell flat for me otherwise the rest was well done for the first part i liked ghost and sam and gilly they didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need jon to follow craster to show what happened to the babies as they are not constrained by point of view characters and if craster cared enough to attack jon it seems unlikely he would have left him alive all of the veteran rangers already knew what craster did with his sons anyway off to dany we get the death of rakharo unfortunate but understandable since the actor got a movie offer that being said it wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t the only option as they did recast ser gregor the change didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t bother me but i didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t feel any emotional impact from the death either theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s sea voyage played out very close to the books and was one of the more natural feeling â<U+0080><U+009C>sexpostionâ<U+0080><U+009D> scenes with the captainâ<U+0080><U+0099>s daughter yara didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t match my image at all but could be forgiven with more screen time in the books she plays along with his flirtations but tells him she is married and keeps his hands from wandering too much in the show theon sticks his hand down the front of her pants without her protesting at all balon did well in his scenes and we shall see where things go from here surprisingly i had almost no problem with littlefingerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s brothel scene it was a bit long and the voyeur part easily could have been cut for more important scenes that were cut short in the end that has always been my biggest problem with most of rosâ<U+0080><U+0099> scenes that so many lines and scenes have to be cut due to time constraints but they make so much time for her scenes but this scene was easily the best of her scenes for me and also the one that most fit something i can imagine the book littlefinger saying so despite my general distain for ros this scene worked for me on itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s own even if i question if there wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t more interesting and important content to cover likewise with stannis and melisandre it didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t bother me even if i canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t say i thought it was a great scene by any stretch davos and salladhor saan played out pretty well though davos did worship the seven even if he wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a particularly religious man and my impression was that prior to recently his son would have worshiped them too so back when davos was a smuggler and matthos was young praying for his fatherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s return it seems unlikely he would have been a follower of the lord of light at that time for that to be a good reason for why davos should follow him a minor point though and overall i liked the scene the most disappointing thing is that most of my complaints are not things that would require a bigger budget or significantly more time but just writing issues that seem to be things that just as easily could have been written more true to the books"

"Howdyphillip",2012-04-09,"i am shocked at how many people are rating this thing 5 and below to me a 5 would be an average episode on american television something like a run of the mill episode of csi whatever the fuck what we are watching in this series is television greatness there is an absolute ceiling for me of a 7 just because of the set design and costuming with the monumental acting that is being done by peter dinklidge and lena heady i am raising it another point and putting this show at an 8 as an absolute minimum for the worst episode they can make this week my final evaluation is at a 9 there was the smallest of disappointments in the casting and name change of asha greyjoy she is one of my biggest book crushes and they just didnt capture her sassyness for me i am willing to withhold judgement because there is something about the actress that just may grow on me otherwise this episode was one of my favorite ways to spend an hour in front of a television i am sure that i will see this over and over again something i never do with other series"
"MegasAV",2012-04-09,"i gave this episode a 6 i really liked some parts but i feel they are really changing the essence of the book with a lot of the changes although i loved how they made pyke appear on the big screen the intitial meeting between yara and theon played nothing like the book and really i feel changed here character in the book it was asha who on several occasions grabbed theons cock moreover with the fake identity she gave him he then opened up to her about his plans his successes in battle with robb etc i know this may sound like nitpicking but it shows a certain cunning which the asha character has which i feel hurts the character portrayal moreover the janos tyrion scene felt extremely rushed i really would have enjoyed if they used some more dailogue from the book in that scene but alas i guess time constraints in terms of stannis i believe dornishsnakes post said it best this character they created is not stannis none of his backstory has been told thus far in the tv show so i dont know how anybody can understand my favorite character from the book not one mention of the siege on storms end no mention of him smashing the ironborn ships his parents perishing on shipbreaker bay i know we are only two episodes into the season but i have no emotional attachment to this stannis whatsover"
"SerBarristan",2012-04-09,"i ranked the episode a 5 heres my explanation from the ep 202 discussion thread with a few additions1 asha was irritating as a character in the books when she was first introduced imo but i grew to like her as the series progressed the actress cast as asha did not display her fire or spiritagree with last she could have shown more spunk3 ok we know that stannis and mel eventually have sex of some sort in the books because of the shadow babies the scene tonight was just weird though and not a good weird the actor portraying stannis and the writersdirectors do nothing to set up the idea that stannis is shown initially to be so brittle that he will break before he bends we do not get a sense at all of his unyielding moral compass which helps show us later his total hypocrisy in the situation with melisandreeh i thought the scene was awkward as hell  on purpose but arent you just quibbling with timing stannis is going to act like hes got a stick up his ass dont worry the hypocrisy will be quite apparent i think4 first the silver and now rakharo wtf writersdirectors i understand the rakharo actor was offered another role but then the show could have done something different than make him a bizarre plot pointlike he rides off never to return wouldnt book people complain what happened to rakharo and then youd have all these conspiracy theories that he might return later in an even greater departure from the books his death served a purpose i liked how they handled this5 why is sam suddenly a horn dog constantly thinking about and looking at women writersdirectors wtfare you serious considering that sam is a 18ishyearold straight male whose taken a vow of celibacy a vow that kinda doesnt make sense and may never know the love of a woman and hasnt even seen a woman for 6 months prior to epi 2 i think a certain amount of sexual frustrationcuriosity is perfectly acceptable so we now know hes an assman word the fact that he takes gilly to his friend jon so they can help her is about as anticreepy as you get shes a person not a goat hello that puts sam about 1000 lightyears ahead of most men in westeros props to sam and as a sidenote i thought the scene with gillyjonsam was brilliant and great acting esp from kit6 littlefinger has now been written to be creepy as shit without book littlefingers intelligence so instead of a great game player who is creepy we get a dip shit who is creepywell what in this episode made him dumb a bud of mine complained the same thing and i dont see it creepy hes not watching his clients to get off dude deals in secrets remember last episode knowledge is power cersei may not appreciate that fact doesnt make it any less true he eavesdrops on his powerful clients to gain leverage its a lot easier to manipulate someone if you know all about their ahem proclivities not so mention people tend to say stuff they probably shouldnt in the throes of passion useful stuff7 loved arya maisie

this site is about the books but appreciate the fact that its an adaptation and choices will be made to  in the showrunners minds  improve storytelling so i dont see the harm in arya revealing her secret this soon what difference does it make if she does it now or latertyrion shae and varys scene is very good overall i am still puzzled at tyrion keeping shae in the tower of the hand though a big part of his problems at court are keeping shae secret not being willing to take her inside the castle and having to sneak out to see her it also pretty much eliminates the idea that maybe ros will

that all the spies in kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s landing wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know about shae by then but beyond that point the scene was well acted and i enjoyed it great considering i disliked season 1 shaeyes agree it makes me think there will be a scene made up to justify the escalation between tyrioncersei like cersei kills ros maybe but for what reason i dunno on this point the books made sense will look forward to what they come up with also it eliminates an opportunity to see varystyrion sneak around the tunnels beneath the city and varys in disguise perhaps they will manufacture another but i liked that stuffthe council meeting where cersei tears up robâ<U+0080><U+0099>s offer went fine nothing particularly bad or good tyrion and janos slyntâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scene played out well and i didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t mind bronn being named captain of the city watch i hate joffrey ordering the killing of robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bastards instead of cersei and tyrion implying that she was worried the bastards might have a claim as the reason she wanted them killed was also silly two hands had already figured out cersei and jamieâ<U+0080><U+0099>s secret based in large part from seeing these bastards and the danger was even higher after stannis sent the letters making the story public rumor joffrey would have been much more likely to kill anyone who spread the â<U+0080><U+009C>liesâ<U+0080><U+009D> than to kill robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bastards as he believed himself to be robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s sonsympathetic to this point but i think joff doing it is plausible tv joff is older than book joff and hes more likely to assert himself plus just because hes confident hes the heir doesnt mean he isnt worried that someone will pickup one of these bastard sons and use him to challenge the throne given the proliferation of kings throughout the realm its clear one does not need an airtight primogenitureobserving claim to get into the action yknow plus i can see joff doing it just because he doesnt like the idea robert had other kids out of wedlock or just because he can joff doesnt particularly need a good reason to be cruel king does as he likesnow reasons why the showrunners opted for this maybe to build up the idea that cersei is loosing control of the situation which neccesitates tyrions badassery also makes cersei more sympathetic and frankly she needs to be cause book cersei is onedimensional rereading some of adwd im sold on that pointthe most disappointing thing is that most of my complaints are not things that would require a bigger budget or significantly more time but just writing issues that seem to be things that just as easily could have been written more true to the booksyeah i think in general though the writers have arguments as to why they depart from the source text whether those arguments are convincing is up for debate but i think most if not all changes are based on improving the storytelling in general andor specific to the tv medium and pragmatic issues eg not confusing audience etc doesnt mean i agree with all their choices but see why a good chunk of them make sense a lot of the new scenes have worked really well imo edited by serbarristan 09 april 2012  1130 pm"

"Dragon greyscale",2012-04-10,"whats wrong with the stannis scene well lets see his entire character is based on him being this slave to duty and virtue and in one of our first scenes with him hes an oathbreaker to his wife cheating on her because shes sick remember when john edwards did that really screams a persons of honour and dutysecond  how he did it a spur of the moment decision again simply screams stannis and worse a spur of the moment decision clearly driven by temptation selfishness and  if im being generous  a bloodlust for power giving him an heirwho is this characterso regardless  even if stannis had sex is the book with her it wouldnt have been anything like this couldnt have beenbut third and most important the book is not clear that they had sex at all you wonder you consider you debate with your friends theres some mysetery therethere is no mystery in the hbo series ever everything is constantly being smashed over your head like the viewers are idiotsthis excuse about medium differences is also getting old there have been great multideminsional suspenseful complicated plots and characters in tv battlestar gallactica bill adama and basically every character on the show most characters from lost deadwood the wiregame of thrones the tv show and its characters dont stand up to any of those shows in a story that was based on mystery and complicated characters every bit of mystery and every complicated part of a character is being systematically removed there was no reason for that stannis scene had nothing to do with medium changes the only reason its in there is because hbo thinks it would get higher ratings if stannis has hot passionate sex scenes with a hot wizard rather than if he didnt the fact that stannis the character would never have a hot sex scene  and certainly not on the spur of the moment  doesnt matter this character is not stannis and hbo doesnt carelast the dialogue why is there so much of it nonstop chatter where is a bit of silence where its just the camera and a character where their face shows what theyre thinking or better yet you wonder what theyre thinking in the cersei and tyrion scenes those great actors have the good sense to at least pause in between sentences in the others its just rapid fire back and forth endlessly for the hour i dont blame them the writers have given the task of conveying everything by words nothing by facial expressions or emotionis there ever going to be a scene that can compare with bill adama crying alone in his quarters a scene that can compare with any of the lost characters having a moment to themselves where you dont know what theyre thinking but want more than ever to find out will hbo ever give us a scene like that like heck they will even though george gave them a raodmap to many scenes like that and better in the booksand dont tell me theres too much story to get through there is also no rule that hbo had to do an entire book in one season they couldve developed the plot far more than they have look how slowly lost was developed look how slowly george developed this story in the books the books arent thousands of pages for georges good health they are thousands of pages because all good stories especially this one must be told at a certain pacehere here theon is tasked to go to his fathers to get reinforcements and is there 5 minutes later with his answer in hand 0 suspense was able to build in that time an outrage the hbo show feels like point form notes where getting through the plot is more a mechanical chore for the writers than a joy and the audience can feel itthe first book alone could have and perhaps should have taken several tv seasons instead hbo handcuffs themselves by trying to tell a 1000 page book in 10 episodes then complains they have to tell the story poorly because they were handcuffed its their own fault theyre handcuffed how can it be an excuse why do people buy that excusefrankly i was embarassed by this episode i havent liked the hbo series at all so far but this episode i didnt know what i story was watching and didnt like it an emabarassing disaster if id never read the books this is the type of story i wouldve laughed at so simple no subtely whatsover even dare i say predictable each and every time they stray from georges plot oh let me guess the hot female wizard gets a sex scene with the kingthe execution of the story is brutal and apart from the imp and the queen all other characters have been dumbeddown so much that they are no longer interesting stannis practically got a labotomy what a tragedy and this is just the beginningso how do you really feel i mean no need to hold back or anything"

"ace",2012-04-10,"gave it a 5 the previous episode was a 6 so its going down hill for me so far the entire episode had a really disjointed feel jumping around not spending more than a couple of minutes on any scene its become obvious that 10 episodes just isnt enough for such a long book even more so with the writers adding things not in the book the show has too much pointless sex in general i know that people say that the books themselves have plenty of sex which is true enough but the writers who are brutally cutting a lot of important and fan favorite things from the book wouldnt cut even 1 second of completely pointless and irrelevant sex scenes take the scene with theon and the girl on the boat in the book its 1 paragraph in a long chapter in this episode its almost as long as the entire travel to pyke and all the conversations in pyke and that for a girl that would never be seen again i wouldve gladly given it up in favor of the feast in pyke for example entire chapters in the books are cut to a 30 second dialog entire paragraphs reduced to a single syllable but every second of every breast must be shown and not content with all the sex in the book the writers feel the need to add even more loras and renly for example or the pointless ros or in this case mel and stannis unlike loras and renly which you might say is implied in the book this is imo completely unlike the book characters book stannis strikes me as almost completely asexual he is all about duty he married his wife out of duty and he keeps mel because she helps him do his duty iirc it is never explained how the shadows are made ive just finished asos so it might be in later books but i just cant imagine melisandre as a seductress or stannis as being lustful and i dont for a moment believe that this scene was made for plot or character development they just wanted to show her naked thats no way to adapt our favorite books daenerys is almost completely cut out so far the only scene being the pointless death of rakharo why jaqen is too plain imhoin the book i imagined him as a sort of cross between syrio drogo and james bond here hes so wooden he says his lines like hes bored and half asleep couldve hired keanu reeves to play him for all the acting he does i dont like that the bastard killing is transferred to joffrey book joffrey is evil enough without blaming him for every bad thing that happens the writers are turning show joffrey into a cartoon that makes emperor palpatine seem like a deep and nuanced character i expected the writers to play up craster sacificing his sons more than in the books so wasnt surprised by it sure its a little odd that hes got a new baby ready just as the watch rides in and he goes to do the deed while theyre stll there but im giving the writers the benefit of the doubt here this might still turn out good if they develop it right i hate ros and every pointless scene shes at every minute shes on the screen is a minute that could be catelyns or aryas or brans or daenerys or any other character that we all love its weird because i loved the first season bubt this one is so far very mediocre im just hoping the show improves with time edited by ace 10 april 2012  0107 am"

"Lord Ravenfrost",2012-04-10,"610 my knee jerk reaction to this last episode was one of disgust i almost gave this a rating of like 310 but i watched the episode again in nonfanboy mode and had somewhat of a change of heart i really love the the way tyrion is continued to be portrayed i look forward to his scenes as much as i looked forward to reading his chaptersi love the way him and bronn interact they seem like they are probably good friends off screen and it shows in their performances i like how they handled theons homecoming it was true to his first chapter in acok although i felt the scenes were rushed and was missing him meeting a very changed uncle before he rode up to see his father i dont like this introduction to ashayara we got i think the woman playing her missed what the character is about and apparently the writers did too it shouldve been yara fondling theon not the other way around they shouldve included the feast as well to really put theon in his proper place as a total outsiderim not sure if i can endure another dumb ass ros scene for someone who wasnt even a sentence in the books she sure chews up the damn scenery i can dig why they put in petyr scenes as they need to develop his character but i feel they could do that with more scenes with varys and him or tyrion or someone other than whores that really dont add anything important or interesting to the story i think they have done a fine job with davos i like the actor playing him i feel like the man did his homework and is doing the character justice i dont like the man playing stannis but i feel that was done on purpose stannis is a total douche in the books ive never liked him and the actor helps achieve this effect without trying salladhor saan is also another pretty spot on performance i think hes gonna be good comic relief for the whole stannisdavos storyline the woman playing melisandre is a bit more plain then i wouldve pictured but i think her acting may yet shine through and shell end up doing the character justice at least i hopearyas scenes are very spot on but again i feel like they are being rushed i like the rapport that arya has with gendry on screen it doesnt seem faked and that is very important for their part of the story all the supporting roles surrounding those characters are very spot on as well especially yoren and hot pie the writers just need to slow things down a bit ive been pretty happy with danys storyline so far even after they killed her blood rider and her silver neither were essential to the story and that really conveyed the direness of her situation the real thing that bothered me was the last few minutes of the episode i just dont understand why that had to happen jon is a very important character and if they plan on moving the story forward they shouldnt be spending too much time at crasters keep as there is a lot story beyond that setting whatever the writers have planned for jon at crasters i hope they wrap it up in the next episode and move on i wouldve given this episode a higher rating but the whole brotheltwist ending kinda pissed me off"

"Qhorin Halfhand and Yoren",2012-04-09,"to me it is all about what is a better character i dont like the changes because a man seduced by a woman promising him a son isnt particularly good character nothing particularly special about him the stannis of the book on the other hand the show stannis does not come as iron willed extremely extremely determined not lustful believing strongly in a moral code believing strongly in duty highly bitter and so on he lacks both the interesting backstory and other aspects of book stannis i do think that book stannis is somewhat of a hypocrite in various ways but it discovering or wondering his hypocricy is only fascinating because of the kind of man that stannis is or mostly is if in the books we immediately found him having sex for a son very easilly succumbing to what melisandre proposes did not give a strong impression of being very determined very bitter very strongly believing in moral codes duty etc etc it wouldnt work a king that is seduced that easily by melisandre isnt as fascinating as their relationship in the books show stannis comes of as a quite more bland character and not as interesting as the book version so yeah that scene is problematic but the lack of sufficient development and backstory previously is also problematic edited by qhorin halfhand and yoren 09 april 2012  1003 pm"

"Net-Viper X",2012-04-09,"i agree with many of you in that i think that stannis did it for the cause and duty with no feelings towards lust i also feel that with his wife being such a fanatic for this religion while stannis himself seems to take it all with a huge grain of salt that it would have had to be at the behest of his wife to have sex with mel for the good of rhillor and their cause i dont think stannis actually believed in the lord of light mumbo jumbo enough at that time to have done the sex act on his own because he would have thought it a hoax and would never stain his honor for such it was his wifes belief rather than his own that ultimately convinced him to go through with it and once he saw the results thats when he started to become a believer i dont think for a minute that a guy like stannis would have betrayed his honor for a son since he would believe that the dishonor he engaged in while creating the child would carry over into that child and the baratheon name that he carried i think the only way he would have sex with someone else for a son would be if his wife was totally in on it and pressured him to do so the fact he has stayed faithful to her all these years despite how obviously miserable he is makes it clear he would never betray their marriage willingly edit forgot to mention i was speaking of the book in the above mentions and thought the scene in the movie was off because it didnt mesh with the event as it is presented in the books edited by netviper x 09 april 2012  1002 pm"

"Parwan",2012-04-10,"i think the problem with melisandre starts earlier than the seduction scene we go to dragonstone and see a bunch of people on the beach they are burning wooden statues it appears that essentially everyone including stannis has become a follower of the red god why there is one person cressen who objects none of the men even respond to him they are moving themselves away from the gods of their fathers and the gods still accepted by most of the people in the seven kingdoms embracing a foreign religion cannot possibly help stannis baratheon and his friends gain alliances in westeros why then would they accept such a religion is its theology that compelling we are given no reason to believe this later davoss son talks about holy books and the power of prayer this again is just one person and im sure followers of the seven could match stories about how their prayers were answered stannis is obviously interested in power what power has melisandre shown to this point this is the main problem with the lack of a backstory not the issue of whether stannis has a daughter or not melisandre has no army no navy no military experience as far as we can tell from the tv show she hasnt performed any magic yet later cressen tries to poison her he dies quickly and she remains healthy and strong this would impress a man interested in power thus the true king might well move toward the worship of the lord of lightafter the poisoning attempt not before did melisandre simply bewitch everyone its not clear"
"Lord Hodor",2012-04-10,"the problem everyone has with this scene has a name  subtlety in the book the stannis  mel relationship is implied always very subtle but it is there for all to see on screen the medium prevents the subtlety unless you want a 2 hour episode every week i do you get straight in your face booty to all who think stannis is some kind of righteous virgin but for the one time he had shireen against sex and masturbation need only to look at some abstnence only kind of reverends and preachers that make the news on the us every now and then and their sexual exploits if they are loud about being against sex its usually because they like it too much"
"stevelabny",2012-04-10,"i dont like stannis i always accuse him of only believing in duty and honor when it benefits him he punishes davos even as he rewards him but he lets renlys men off scotfree because he needs them he talks about hes rightful king but he helped overthrow aerys etc etc that said ive taken two implications from the books about stannismel 1 hes slept with her 2 he doesnt seem to know whats going with the shadow babies which in my mind always meant she was beguiling himand with more than just her feminine charms the scene played so awkwardly on tv i might still believe that at least until stannis directly speaks about their relations or accepts responsibility for shadow babies of course i also believe the fight scene between ned and jaime in s1 clearly showed jaime toying with ned and ned fighting for his life and then jaime suddenly realizing hell have to at least try but a lot of viewers and dd themselves seem to think that it showed an even match"
"Sci-2",2012-04-10,"he could but then he shouldve banged another woman years ago if he was so desperate for a sonbut no other woman could absolve him of his adultery in the way a red pope couldthe only way stannis can win is if melis has miraculous powers but theres also the fact that for most lords  who likely dont care about religion save as a means of advancement  even if stannis is defeated they can switch sidesit is a game for the nobility so unless you have a sincere faith in the seven burning their idols doesnt matter and there isnt any overly good reason to believe in the seven since unlike the weirdwood or rhollor they have no magicmiracles"
"Rockroi",2012-04-10,"my issue with stannis in the series is that he appears to be far less selfassured than the stannis of the books this could be for several reasons but one that must be relevant is that seriesstannis has only been around for 34 scenes while books stannis has had a much longer time to grow in the books stannis is portrayed as a righteous powerhouse not just davos but tywin varys cersei and tyrion all recognize that stannis is far far more dangerous than robb renly or greyjoy stannis is a proven battle commander who is hard tough and supremely serious varys goes so far to say that there is nothing more fearsome than a righteous man with a rightful cuase davos obviously has deep resepct for stannis and for very good reasons as time goes on those who are introduced to stannis are impressed with his seriousness his honor his desire to do his duty and his leadership this is no small list either people as diverse as asha greyjoy to jon snow are not awed of stannis but give him his due respect at almost every turn seriesstannis seems a far cry so far from that stannis series stannis seems far more skittish he lacks the baratheon confidence that he embraced so much in clash of kings seriesstannis is mopey he seems to talk far more about his slights and insults than he does recapturing the throne again thats a distinct difference from the book in the books stannis does gripe but his gripes seem very reasonable hes pissed that renly is trying to upjump him he cannot abide by renlys lack of loyalty while stannis was very loyal to robert even though he did not love robert even though stannis eventually does admit that he did love robert scene outside of storms end and really who could blame stannis for this series stannis almost appears petty just another vain lord who wants the crown for himself but in the book stannis is described by many as dutybound melisandre says that stannis just like jon snow puts duty above all else stannis believes in his mission and in his roll moreso than in a glory stannis after all went to the wall because the wall asked and he believed them no other king not even robb did anything like that stannis states at one point that its not that he wants the iron throne that want plays no part in the decision instead stannis is the king regardless of choice seriesstannis seems void of this dutyquotient which brings us to the sex at first i was put off by stannis sexscene with mel however i was reminded that in the books its revealed that mel and he are in fact having sex and the lack of recollection on my part says a great deal more about me than it does martin or the shows writers i think stannis has desires just like other men but having them revealed so blatantly is offputting mel tells stannis stuff he wants to hear so its not really surprising that stannis gives into a reasonable temptation but by doing so the show portrays stannis again as weak insofar as stannis appears like hes being tricked that he is the pawn in mels game as opposed to being a mover in it this is in contrast to robert who fucked what he wants and does not think twice about it or even renly who while hiding his homosexuality has sex that he wants with peers stannis appears to be having sex with somebody who is using him hardly a peer and this is almost 100 of what we know about seriesstannis unlike bookstannis who was involvbed with jon arryns discovery and held storms end from the tyrells and redwynes and who crushed the greyjoy fleet seriesstannis looks like the indicisive unsure vacilating lord who just wants to be king and has some hot woman tricking him into having sex with her now with all that said i am not sure its a bad interpretation of stannis book stannis does resent robert and clearly thought ill of renly asha greyjoy sees his resentment of robert and even davos sees stannis ire towards renly stannis does harp on petty slights and sometimes with good reason however i think whenever we talk about stannis we have to see his whole image and so far the book is harping only on those aspects of stannis that can appear weak or indicisive i think in time the series has to color in the parts of stannis that are hard honorable and tough"
"Ferrum Aeternum",2012-04-10,"implied or not i never questioned that mel and stannis had sex in the books not even in acok if nothing else davoss observation at the end of the shadowbaby chapter gave it away  he knew that shadow as he knew the man whod cast it that said the seduction scene itself felt a bit clumsy and rushed i would have preferred stannis resist melisandres seduction until episode 3 or 4 the fact that he gave in to her relatively easily undercuts that iron will that stannis is so wellknown for i had no particular problem with mel playing the son card as i believe the subject of stanniss dissatisfaction with not having a son and heir is broached on at least a few occasions in the books"
"Rohanne",2012-04-10,"that scene did not sit well with me either it is probably the first time i was disappointed with their adaptation of the books also i do not care for all the extra sex scenes they keep adding that were not even in the book i am not sure if they are trying to cater to a certain audience but i think they are a little over the top at times i love the books but this is definitely my least favorite aspect about the show guess that is what happens when it is on hbo"
"hotweaselsoup",2012-04-10,"hbo stannis  book stannis and its very easy for nonreader viewers to grasp onto the idea that kings need heirs plus hbo loves showing nudity and it was probably an easy excusei was very displeased with this scene as i am a firm believer that stannis has not slept with mel in the novelsi dont think that his honor would allow iti completely agree stannis is so ironbound by duty and rules that i cannot conceive of him knowingly sleeping with melisandre that said i can very easily see melisandre glamouring herself to look like selyse and through this deception tricking stannis into having sex with her"
"Hear Us Roar",2012-04-10,"beggars cant be choosers we have seen stannis drop his honor bs when the reality of the situation needed him to riding in battle with pirates and smugglers using sorcery etc the reality of the situation is that he does not have enough men and must do the not so honourable thing like kill his brother with magic and not in the field so he also needs an heir as his wife cannot produce a son which all kingslords know is needed to ensure your security in you position so stannis bent the rules again when the reality of the situation called for it"
"Sixshells",2012-04-10,"although it would be possible to imagine mel using glamours to trick him into having sex with her i dont see him accepting simply in the hopes of having a bastard son that he might eventually legitimise if that motivation were present in him he would have used it a long time ago to sire bastards maybe as rationalisation to allow himself to act on his attraction for women he might have met or it would be necessary for the two of them to argue that now that he is king he cannot let his kingdom without an heir which would excuse his breaking his marriage vows that i would be more ready to buy but not in the way its described in the showbut no other woman could absolve him of his adultery in the way a red pope couldstannis is a selfrighteous prick who places his own sense of morality and justice above all else and doesnt give a crap about the gods unless he can use others belief in them and even so he is often reluctant i totally believe that he is ready to do dishonourable things if he sees interest in doing so but only if he can justify it to himself mel absolving him of his sin under the eye of the red god would do little to him rationalising about how it would help him reinforce his power in the long run including by humouring the very powerful sorceress at her side even if he clearly does not realise all that it entails sure edited by sixshells 10 april 2012  0659 pm"

"Ghyran",2012-04-11,"from the book my image of stannis was that he wasnt really interested in women i was suprised by this scene i though season 1 was very much like the first book but so far im of the impression that the directors are choosing to change details abit more in season 2"

"lannisterbannerman",2012-04-11,"it probably would have been more effective if the sex scene between stannis and melisandre was implied rather than actually shown for me personally it made stannis appear far weaker and more susceptible to manipulation than i think his character truly is i saw no lust in the scene though only a mans desperation for a male heir and the presentation of a possible way of achieving it i do like stephen dillanes portrayal thus far but he still has a bit of proving to do as for carice van houten i think she very much fits the part melisandre has always seemed to be one of the darker characters in the series and her ambiguous goals and ideas are shown through houtens version of the character"
"birdsong66",2012-04-11,"i didnt really mind the scene and thought it rather well done by dillane in that he managed to capture how uncomfortable stannis is in his own skin as for melisandre im still on the fence regarding the actress imo shes not subtle enough as a tvmel be it due to writing or acting skill which is to say overall the problem with season 2 will continue to be the introduction of new characters at the expense of other previously established characters but without the backstory that accompanies each in the novels the fleshingout is sacrificed for time constraints so we have succinct presentations befitting an hour viewing rather than a more paced and methodical layering as was presented in the wire deadwood oz it is only a problem if one expected an exact duplication on screen it seems to me there is deeper meaning to the shadowbaby than simply a magical thing that melisandre can produce stannis is a character who must remind others that he is not without mercy but who is largely regarded as one with no capacity for mercy he is clearly duty motivated versus honor it is his duty to produce an heir as king preferably male and thus dishonoring his marriage in the service of duty fits stannis pathology whether syleese is on board or not i mean this is a man who cut off the fingers of davos who smuggled supplies that saved his life while under siege for smuggling in the past the shadow baby to me is the same shadowshade that the novels refer to describing the dead as a concept not physically present but a shadow on ones memory if you will that donderion became a shadow of the man he was in younger years as the toll of rebirth was paid leaving only a shell of the strongest characteristics in personality is important it is the same with stannis the shadow baby is his essence no pun intended it is that thing that he cannot consciously bring himself to do that is unleashed to do as he desires nonetheless call it his soul call it whatever but it is his deepest urges his darkest secrets his wrath set free the shadow baby is a version of stoneheart in that ls has become the darkest urges that were present but controlled while alive he grows weaker as melisandre grows stronger some would suggest hes actually dead but continuing in a shadowshade state himself i think he knows about the shadow baby in the same way bran knows that jaime pushed him out a window in the deepest recesses of their consciousnessso would he sleep with her yes would she give birth to his darkest demons yes will others suffer for it yes because he is without mercy and driven by duty alone and like his father the shadowbaby is without mercy duty bound and ultimately will be the death of stannis"

"Stannis is the Mannis",2012-04-12,"yeah i thought this scene was poorly done stannis is an early casualty of the hbo format this season for starters they cut out scenes with his family to save time but the result is you dont get the missing piece that selyse is a devout follower of mel the reason shes there in the first place and that selyse encourages stannis to follow her even though stannis is reluctant at first it also seems to me that theyre trying to build suspense for the eventual shadow birthing scene by giving a reason why mel can be shown as pregnant and shocking the tv viewers when they find out that its no normal baby assuming this hunch is correct its just one of a number of detrimental slights to the character of stannis all for the sake of raciness episodic dramasuspense and other tv show necessities the next issue is that hbo wanting to make the show as racy as possible forces the onscreen sex scene which takes away all subtlety and provokes a much different reaction from the viewer its not that i have a problem with the scene itself other than the invented motives and lack of context but they have laid next to no groundwork yet for the stannis character very little backstory has been shown or his ironwilled dutiful and honordriven nature in fact the best we get of that is davos telling saan that stannis is the most honorable man he knows yet only minutes later he is sleeping with the red lady through lust and the manufactured desire of wanting a son instead of building his ironwilled dutiful character first and subtly showing the sexual relation with mel after the character has some credibility theyve chosen to essentially start with that although many people identify with and support stannis in the books itll be near impossible for a tv viewer to be fond of a character that has done nothing as of yet but cheat on his wife out of lust theres no coming back from that either because as far as the show is concerned viewers first impression will always be that of an adulterer and when the show later tries to build on stanniss identity of justice duty etc it will just seem silly the whole problem is that theyve removed any argument for those of us who believe in the book his motives for his exploits with the red lady were to win the iron throne and that if he was not encouraged by his wife in the very least you get some idea that she would be ok with it because she vehemently follows melisandre now clearly these last two points are debated in the book by some but the problem is its not even debatable in the show because theyve taken out key facts and are left with a 1dimensional stannis and that if nothing else is their biggest misstep they took a character that has layers and can be debated his motives his honor etc and created the opposite its really unfortunate because itll be very hard for them to bring him back from this i know its early in the season but theyve already changed too many important background aspects of stannis and they wouldnt have introduced things such as his motive of wanting a son if they werent going to continue with it and in the end i feel all of these changes have just been brought about because of hbos lack of time and need for sex and suspense theyve taken my favorite character from the book and created a character that even i dont like in the show edited by stannis is the mannis 12 april 2012  0157 pm"

"Lyeder",2012-04-15,"i did not really enjoy the scene  but i expected it it was hinted at several points in the books so it was obvious that they would not let an occasion like this pass to have a sex scene however i did not find stannis particularly lusty but rather angry and strong in that scene of course in this particulare situation where he projects himself kind the necessity of a heir might push him more than in other moments of his life somehow i also always got the impression in the books that selyse does not mind the relation beween melisandre and stannis she is so fanatically into that new religion that it is more important than her marriage which has never been a passionate one"

"Reposado",2012-04-09,"i liked him a lot other than the hair which seems to be toned down across the board not sure what more we could have expected dont think he shoudl have an accent as much as syrio does since for all we know lorathi accents arent as notable for westerosi as braavosi"

"Morky_Pep",2012-04-11,"this is a show where you have to actually pay attention this is not 90210 you have to actually make connections to understand whats going on and thats what makes this show like nothing else on television what makes it brilliant is that you can watch throughout the season once and get the main plot points and be shocked by the huge developments and then you can rewatch it again and again and pick out the multitude of details that you missed the first time thats what i did with season 1 i watched the first 3 episodes in one day and was totally flimsy on what was actually going on but i knew that i loved it so i finished the season rewatched it  then started the books casual viewers went through the same things when they watched the first season they were somewhat confused who are these people what is the society like who am i interested in then they got used to it and started to enjoy their favorite characters now when you watch a second season of a show you expect your need to pay attention to decline because well youve already gotten used to the idea and feel of the showtake walking dead for instance all you need to know for the second season is there is zombie apocolypse and ricks wife cheated on him with his best friend when she thought he was dead and tjhis isnt the same for got season two is like watching a new series the feel has changed from the first season there is a plethora of new characters and this confuses and scares people because they are not accustomed to it my belief is that as the season rolls on and they start to get used to theon stannis and davos as being main characters they will start to enjoy it much more jsut like season one the same is with the books really ive read other series like wheel of time whewre after you get the feel for the characters from the first book its just a breeze read through the next ones with each asoiaf book you have to approach it like a new series and focus and remember who people are and this may put off some readers but for me i love it it is what seperates it from so many other series you can read them again and catch all the subtle thingsfrey pies the clues that bran actually isnt dead the stinky steward ect unless you visit sites liek these where people catch them and post them for you it is this reasoning that this is the best show ever it may not be perfect in its adaptation but it does a pretty good job with the scope i think that people will watch the season skim the surface see some crazy sht and then be like wow that was awesome i didnt fully get it but was awesome im going to watch it again"

"Lord Varys",2012-04-12,"varys did sell his remaining private parts while living on the streets of myr but that was after he was cut and he did it most likely not for pleasure eunuchs also want to love and be loved thats true but varys is not as stupid to let his desireswishes to get the better of him in fact he and tyrion actually discuss this topic in asos and varys very hints at the fact that tyrions obsession with shae will prove to be his downfall varys was rather pissed by littlefinger indicating he could use his little birds for his sexual pleasure thats most likely not the case not in the series and not in the books"
"Hear Us Roar",2012-04-12,"well i think she is referring to the fact that she thinks he is asexual because he is a eunuch that is not true but the way they view sexuality back then that is why the did it to male guarding females"
"sarah.jenice",2012-04-12,"i interpreted it as he was gay because i thought he looked surprise when shae told him she could always tell i took it as shae saying varys didnt like women and he asked her how she could tell i thought tyrion saying he was going to make a fisherman of him yet was one of his funniest lines"
"Mr. E",2012-04-12,"interesting tidbit to notice i myself never thought varys was gay it was fairly apparent from the start that his feminine attire if i may that a couple have referenced the powders the perfumes the giggling is just an act anyway i dd did mean to imply this however its a great study of subtlety in dialogue"
"Lord Varys",2012-04-12,"i interpreted this i can always tell as a nod towards book shaes talent to see through varyss disguises he was rather pissed about that in the books but the start of the conversation was varys commenting about shaes cover story tyrion finding her in tywins kitchens so i rather believe this was all part of the veiled threats business"
"Blood Rider",2012-04-12,"the scene was more to me like veiled threats disguised cleverly in a trade of words witty and humorous i would love to see shaes gaydar on loras tyrell though"
"Hyper",2012-04-12,"i always assumed varys had homosexual tendencies not only for being a eunuch since in the books there are eunuchs later who are heterosexual but also for his demeanour attire and general depiction as a characterremember that varys is an actor everything he does is carefully done to project a certain image this is why people dont recognize him in his disguises edited by hyper 12 april 2012  1100 am"
"Ser Lepus",2012-04-12,"people in westeros seem to have certain preconceptions with regard to eunuchs all become effeminate etc so maybe shae is just repeating those preconceptions even if she can perceive that varys isnât lusting over her that doesnât mean that he is homosexual but shae probably thinks that every man who doesnât desire her is gay"
"Envie",2012-04-12,"i also think the point of that scene was more about the veiled threats as others have said and not so much to expose varys sexuality one way or the other someone else also pointed out that later in the books we learn that eunuchs do in fact still have desires whether sexual or just for affection as is revealed with the unsullied slaves after freed do go to whorehouses varys has verbally sparred with littlefinger on more than one occasion about his sexuality and i felt varys won that one with his you seem unusually obsessed with my gash remarks personally he successfully deflected littlefingers insinuation about his little birds being boys that varys must be interested in sexually too varys has spent many years perfecting the art of being neutral and i believe this translates into his sexuality as well i dont think littlefinger has any dirt on him at all in that regards and tyrions likely just poking at an already well poked at sore spot for varys varys clearly is used to this sort of insinuating and doesnt bat an eye at it when tyrion tries to use it as a threat thats why tyrion had to stop him forcefully at the door and just come right out and say what he wanted to say  because he knows varys is the master of masking emotions and using veiled threats is varys asexual or homosexual we dont know and the scene probably helps viewers start to wonder this for themselves martin has never explicitly said in the books but then again he never explicitly said renly and loras were lovers either so theres always wiggle room for interpretation"
"Im no Ser",2012-04-12,"as tyrion follows it up by talking about our disadvantages i assume the line was a reference to the fact that they both have physical disadvantages  eg tyrions dwarfism and varys castration ive always wondered whether varys was a eunuch at all or whether it was just yet another disguise that he wears shaes line seems to settle it for the series given her ability to see through his disguises"

"Envie",2012-04-12,"because giggling eunuchs are perceived as less of a threat both short and long term than heman knights in the pc world of westeros its pretty clear that at least part of the varys personality is an act there are several occasions when he is talking to people who are usually about to die and his voice changes to the point where it doesnt sound like the same manbtw i think hes a eunuch his story about his castration has the ring of truth to me but at the end of the day the only evidence on the subject weve received is his word and hes a professional liari agree with you that the giggling simpering and powdered looks are all part of an act too this was revealed in the books as well as in the show when he came to ned stark repeatedly dressed as the jail guard and speaking less femininelyi too think varys is actually a eunuch but is playing on westeros beliefs that being a eunuch must make you weak and girlish somehow not necessarily homosexual but definitely not manly either robbing a man of his manhood does not necessarily turn him gay or even weak as we later learn with the unsullied"
"Dr. Pepper",2012-04-12,"this particular scene was very well done and was not meant to question varys sexuality it was a humorous spar with words where the show was able to tell the audience that varys has a way of knowing but shae does also a lot of characters in both the books and the show try to make guesses about varys sexuality but all of these snide comments made to varys become unfounded throughout the series lf implies that hes a pedophile who likes boys since he assumes his little birds must be all boys but in the epilogue of adwd we learn that they are in fact children of both genders there are many characters within the series who have questionable sexuality or sexual practices that later turn out to be true but varys is has never so much as slipped up in two decades to reveal that he is anything but what he says he is  a eunuch who has no friends and knows no love i think varys is a eunuch and i trust that his story to tyrion has elements of truth in it however there are lots of theories floating out there that varys may in fact be a woman the evidence these theories present coupled with the conversation with shae give merit to the theories i think its unlikely varys is a woman but the theories are interesting nonetheless"
"Bastard of Boston",2012-04-12,"this is varys at his core i think his main goal is to keep people guessing he may be gay he may be straight he may be all the above one thing that is definitely not straight about him is the idea that hes not likely to ever give you a straight answerabout anything"
"Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl",2012-04-12,"i have watched this episode twice now and i think i have found something many people have missed im referring to the second scene in the episode with varys tyrion and shaethe first part of the conversation is light and fun before the overall tone gets serious by varys mentioning he knows about shae not being allowed in kings landing here is the part i am referencingtyrion strange things do happen you should taste her fish pieshae i dont think lord varys likes fish pievarys how can you tell in a playful toneshae i can always tell smilingvarys leans his head back and smiles at shaetyrion men like lord varys and i cant let our disadvantages get the best of us well make a fisherman of him yetnow that this little tidbit has been written down for you to analyze i probably dont have to go into too much detail as to what i think it means i also want to mention that i dont really care about varys sexuality but i just found this little bit interesting as it seems very subtle but also obvious at the same time it seems to me that david and dan are suggesting that varys is gay i could be looking too much into it but ive watched this scene so many times i cant come up with any other conclusion as to why it was written this particular wayof course this revelation doesnt affect the story at all but im just happy to have found something that no one else seems to have found tell me im not crazyin season one littlefinger eluded to the same thing"
"Fredwin",2012-04-12,"did we ever get a pov where he admits to himself that he is a eunuch all i can remember is the horrific story he tells about how he became one but that could all be lies outside of that how do we know hes a eunuch at all i certainly wouldnt want visual evidence"
"Lady Olenna",2012-04-12,"i thought the reference was pretty obvious  my ears pricked up at the mention of fish pie because it just stands out i thought it was absolutely hilarious and i loved how the end of the conversation continued with the threats if being tossed into the sea but good old varys continues to paddle i do think that a woman adept in the ability to please men for money would probably be able to sum up a man pretty quickly so shae may indeed know what she is talking about"

"Hyper",2012-04-10,"i actually hate those fans that complain over minor details but changing ashas name just irks me to no end i know its only a name but for a character who plays a fairly major role in the book series it sort of strips some of the character from her when they change her name maybe im naive but when an author gives a character a name i believe it means something and taking that away sort of tarnishes things a bit for me of course i wont give up on the show or the character over a name change by the way i like the actressits a bit too early to tell but i think she can really grow into the role but i just would rather call her by her book name because the show name changes nothing it only insults the audiences intelligencedont be ridiculous a name is just a name the only meaning it has is what you have assigned to it it is not intrinsic to the character itselfasha  yara  whatever it is a good character the name is a minor detail if the portrayal of the character is up to par and it seems to be so far few will care edited by hyper 10 april 2012  0111 pm"

"Envie",2012-04-10,"its funny because we barely ever heard osha called osha they could have changed her name this season and none would be the wiserthis im not sure what producers meeting got together and decided it would be a better idea to change asha to yara which sounds like a stupid name imo than to change osha to something else in most readers  fans opinion ashas role in the story is pretty significant while yes osha does accompany bran and rickon north beyond the wall i dont feel shes as politically an important character and her name could have been easier to change without as much confusion or fan criticism"
"howland_reed",2012-04-10,"i think the confusion will come when theon returns to winterfell and will obviously confront and probably try and bed osha at that point i can understand why producers feel she needs a different sounding name from theons sister my main problem with the name change is not the name change itself but that yara is just so phonetically different that its hard to accept it also sounds softer and more feminine i dunno which doesnt really suit ashas character i wouldve been fine with a change if they at least chose a name thats at least similar sounding to asha why not ashara or even aisha or why not just ashe which is more androgynous but could still be used for females yara sucks"

"DaBillmann",2012-04-15,"someone else already said this but i want to add my two cents unfortunately yarras scenes were cut so much shorter on the show than they were in the book it was hard to get any idea of her personality this is not a case of bad acting or evenbad writing it is a case of underusing the character lets give her a chance people as far as changeing the name on the surface it seems stupid to change the name to avoid confusion but i also must say that in a series liek this with so many characters it can be easy to confuse characters i remember when i readthe lord of the rings at one point frodo says soemthing to faramir and i was thinking wait frodod is not with the riders of rohan for soem reason i kept confusing faramir anbd eomar and there were points when i woudl confuse asha with doran martells daughter cant think of her namne right now i woudlbe talking to my friend about the martell girl and refer to her as asha not trying to justify the name change just saying even when yo uare carefully readingwatching the series yo ucna get soem characters confused"

"Dr. Pepper",2012-04-09,"ive been a supporter of ros inclusion on the show last season her character gave viewers intimate knowledge of certain characters in the easiest and visually pleasing way possible book readers know theon confusion with his identity leads him down horrible paths and book readers know that littlefinger is a manipulative slimy pimp but viewers dont know this hence the need for a ros however i find myself baffled by her inclusions in this season thus far at first i thought shed take the place of chataya or alayaya but since tyrion brought shae to the tower of the hand theres no need for chatayas brothel or tunnel the only other thing we got from chataya and her tunnels is the knowledge that tywin created them but we got that same sort of information in this episode from varys when he casually mentioned that tyrion found shae in tywins kitchens then when ros was instructing the whore i thought maybe she would be the one to instruct a fake arya should they include that storyline since shes the only person in kings landing that knows winterfell apart from sansa the crying scene left me even more confused about her purpose we have already been shown that littlefinger is slimy manipulative sneaky and not afraid to hurt people last season we saw him betray ned and catelyn we saw him make sansa uncomfortable we saw him threaten violence to ned we saw him treat his whores like slaves and objects we saw him basically start a war with false information we saw him get one over on varys we learned very well that littlefinger is all about littlefinger and he will get his way without any consideration of honor why do we need to have it beaten into our heads again we didnt learn anything new about littlefinger unless the man he was talking about was qyburn i liked the scene but i grow weary of seeing littlefinger and ros so much it seems as if hes had more scenes than any other character on the show i want to learn something new about other show characters or spend more time on some of the main characters"

"mrkorb",2012-04-09,"i found myself wondering what the point of this scene was after i watched it on the surface of things it felt like an unnecessary followup to the bastard slaughter montage from the previous episode then i paid a little more attention to the things baelish saida very wealthy patron he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely sad girl to use her in ways thatnever occur to most men and you know what occurs to most menwho do we know that has a lot of money what rather mysterious beautiful and smart girl was rather recently discovered in the war camp of somebody who has a lot of money i think this mystery whore that he was talking about is shae and she was bought by tywin lannister lets not forget where shae ends upas for transforming her we know varys has his informers and baelish has his informers and cersei has hers so why not tywin his instruction to tyrion that he not bring her to court he has to know that tyrion will rebel at that so now shae is tywins person on the inside maybe not as inside as he would like but at the very least shes there when he isnt and might have a way to send him information on what tyrion is up tothat or hbo wanted a scene with some gratuitous jizz wiping just a theory i came up with for what otherwise seemed to be a throwaway inserted scene with no basis in the books"

"Davos55",2012-04-10,"dr pepper and mrkorb i also definitely got a vibe that the story he was telling had a greater purpose than just showing little fingers malicious side which is well established so far i like your theory about it being about shae and tywin i think that is very interesting and it actually makes a lot of sense the books dont go into why shae was in tywins bed when she met her doom and i figured the show would definitely flesh that out more the scene from last season with bronn tyrion and shae playing the lying game definitely showed that she was hiding something and she got very defensive i am curious to see where the show goes with the whole tywin and shae storyline as far as the scene itself i believe it was a decent one overall and it may have some implications later on my theory is that after this ros will really want to please little finger and she will become an efffective little bird for him i dont believe dd would put this much time into a non book character if she wasnt going to play a bigger role later that will have some more ramifications on the plot little finger is one of my favorite characters in the novels for sure and while the show version definitely deviates from my personal vision of him he is still very intriguing and i like to see any scene with him in it i hope there will be more scenes with him and sansa him and varys and him and joffrey one on one ps i really hope the show starts to show more of sandor clegane he is definitely one of my favorites in the novels and he hasnt gotten nearly enough time on the series yet"

"Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl",2012-04-10,"we are not discussing sexual exploitation here we are discussing littlefinger he is not a pimp in the books in the sense that he personally oversees trains and punishes prostitutes in his employ or prostitutes working in brothels he owns of course he is taking advantage of sansa and stuff but she is a special case as i see the character this is not habit meaning that littlefinger does not treat all women in the same way as he treats sansalittlefinger  sexual exploitation he is a pimp in the books but no one cares because brothelswhorehouses are acceptable businesses in westeros he held meetings with catelyn and ned inside one of his brothels because he was able to make money for other high lords and was backed by john arryn is the only reason that he sits on the high council without those connections he would still only be littlefinger the brothel owner edited by ororo727 jon snow fangirl 10 april 2012  0240 pm"

"lyvyathan",2012-04-11,"a lot of people in the initial thoughts thread like me thought the scene with ros and littlefinger was unnecessary and wasted time in the episode that could have gone to other more worthy story linesapparently the producers felt it was necessary to better flesh out just how sinister peter can be based on their interview hereinside the episode httpwwwyoutubectureplppvideoafter watching this narrative of several of the scenes i better understand the reasoning for the crying ros scene but im not entirely convinced it was still that necessary everyone by now knows how despicable littlefinger is and how dangerous he can be those who havent read the books undoubtedly believe him to be fairly slimy and immoral even if they dont know yet whats to come with sansa and the eyrie etcperhaps the producers are wrangling with how to chisel down all the political info that was in book 2 and make it easier to digest for television viewers dumbing it down would require a lot more exposition and scene manipulating i suppose maybe since they added that scene last week with cerseis play on littlefinger which made him look weak they felt it necessary to add a scene this week to show just how powerful he is if only behind the scenes in secretyes as dd stated at the base of littlefingers suave well groomed appearance and carefully controlled speech is a pimp hes still just a pimp trying to turn a buck at the expense of human livesi hear you but the added dialogue for hbo lf seems baffling to me when there are better ways to do it without sledgehammering the point through there were many ways they could have done that  im sure you could also imagine a number yourself we already knew that lf was a treacherous bastard in season 1 if they wanted to have him be seen as a cold heartless pimp  a brief scene could be shown where hes letting a padolord into a room filled with terrified very young girls  after taking his payment door closes girls start to scream horribly viewers imagination takes care of the rest lf walks off jiggling his gold purse and not giving a damnthe problem with the hbo dialogue and the ros crying scene not to mention the semen wipe  is that it unnecessarily takes away time that could have been devoted to other important events  like explaining who or what were mel and stennis and dragonstone etcetcyeah i get it that it serves to titillate the audience but really thats plenty of other opportunities for that i always thought that the sex scenes in the books served to show how wretched the lives of the ordinary folk were and how horrible things could get when violent men were unleashed  hello ramsay snowfrankly im still upset about 201 when lf openly mocks cersei and then compounds it with a condesending lecture on knowledge and power  in the same way he did with varys in season 1  anyone familiar with the books would realize that lf was much too clever to do such a stupid acthaving said that im not too surprised because hbo chose to revamp renly into a stereotypical gay character i really wanted to see someone that looked like a younger version of robert  and who would otherwise seem a sterotypical king candidate  ie like the actor who plays king henry 8th in the tudors then we find out later hes gay  now thats a big surprise we didnt get instead we get gay blow jobs and semen wipes sorry didnt mean to offend"

"ChromeWeasel",2012-04-11,"it kind of helps that he consistently thinks of her as too young and refers to her as his child bridei also want to acknowledge the possibilty that your difficulty in understanding the term sexual predator could be due to a language barrier i dont know where you are from but here in the us where the term originated it is always understood to refer to a person committing sex crimes ive already explained how sex crimes despite using the word sex have little do with the sex as a primary motivation so i wont go into that againim american im not having difficulty understanding sexual predator as a term in fact i made sure that i looked it up before commenting on it its clear from reading most posts from people who are arguing against me that not everyone actually bothered to find out what the term actually means its a bit like people arguing over what a hate crime is and telling me that because someone was hateful and someone committed a crime that said person committed a hate crime thats not how things work the term is what the term is littlefinger engaging in activities where other people are taken advantage of sexually do not make him fit the definition of a sexual predator saying that littlefinger may have had a factor into selling children into slavery dont make him a sexual predator those are despicable activities for sure but suggesting that they indicate hes a sexual predator only confirms that someone doesnt understand what the term sexual predator representsmy take was that sexual predator is not a particularly good fit for littlefinger if you want to you can make an argument for him being a sex predator but its a weak argument that doesnt apply to westeros at all and cant be borne out by the facts of whats going on in the books the closest thing you come to is the conjecture that all of littlefingers acts are in hopes of bedding sansa that may or may not be true otherwise littlefinger has shown very little interest in pursuing sex with anyone"

"bloodymime",2012-04-11,"littlefinger is already shown as a bad man but in a series that prides itself on not being just black and white maybe theyre trying to add some refinement to the character it all comes down to opinion i know but i see littlefinger as a man that sees people as objects or as he refers to them as pawns in the first book the only real reference he makes towards his whores is how they are a solid investment now here in the show he is explaining to a whore how she is nothing but an investment going bad and if that doesnt change all he can do is try to recoup his losses unless they start flashing subliminal messages of peter standing over the red keep with puppet strings attached to his fingers they have to show some personal interaction with him to show how he sees people and his world as for the voyeurism scene i see that as a visual reminder that this is the game of thrones theres always someody watching they dont seem to be placing the same emphasis on the little birds in the show as the books where no one seems to talk without thinking about how there are always little birds about and there is truly no place private in kings landing"
"Dr. Pepper",2012-04-11,"i think this entire thread including the parts that veered off into what lf is doing in book 4 has really helped flesh out why this particular scene was included in the episode its made me reconsider how necessary this type of scene is for a tv audience we book readers are given lots of subtle hints about lfs character in the first two books hes seems like a behindthescenes guy in the books because hes not often in the presence of pov characters however once he steals sansa we learn all i dont think it would make sense for tv if littlefinger is never seen to be doing anything despicable and then he suddenly shows up on a midnight boat carrying sansa off to the vale and says surprise i was totally the man who was behind all the little plots im a dirty scoundrel and without warning im going to start grooming sansa in a dirty sexual predator sort of way the crying ros scene becomes a pretty important part to building up what we book readers know where lf is going im glad for how far into the future this discussion has gone because it reminds me that not everyone watching the show has or will read the books and im learning a little bit about how producers are able to successfully adapt an authors work"

"Envie",2012-04-12,"qyburn is a disgraced maester serving with the brave companions he most likely never was in kl before he arrived there in asos nor is it implied that he has connections to influential people before he starts hanging with powerful people before he hangs out with cerseibut who did qyburn serve before he was exiled youre forgetting the sequence of events its likely littlefinger already knows qyburn and his particular tastes for live victims to do his experiments on from the past im not saying qyburn is the exact patron hes referring to when hes talking to ros about the girl from lys because i dont think he is  but as others have said littlefingers already on numerous occasions by varys mostly been outed for his willingness to cater to exotic requests in his brothelsi would also point out the difference here to me1 lf is amoral when it comes to how his employee whores are used as hes willing to hire out girls for sexually deviant patrons but this does not necessarily label him a sexual predator himself2 littlefingers future role with sansa and his particular desires would label him a sexual predator as others are so fond of pointing outof coures these are both important in the list of reasons why hes despicable and slimy but  i still think the two arguments are completely separate in this thread of debatesmy argument started at my original post is that thus far weve already been shown through arguments with varys as well as other exposition scenes just how vile petyr baelish can be the scene with his threats to ros and the revealing of scary things done to another whore who refused to be happy and work wasnt necessary for that nor does it indicate any sort of predetermined pedophilebehaviortocome with sansa in the futureyour point and others who have stated it does have merit theres a possible trigger here to indicate that littlefingers past caterings play a significant part in future caterings as well hes clearly willing to do iti too would have much rather seen him having jeyne trained for her future role as the arya bride to bolton  but given she too is just a young girl im going to assume the producers feel thats a nono area modern viewers are very sensitive about apparently consensual sex between siblings is ok to film but anything sexual or even implying sex between an adult and child would not although as i type this im reminded of how young daenerys was when she was married to khal drogo too  but of course in the series they made her an adult or did they theres a fine line between what is consensual and forced i dont think the training of a noble girl in a whorehouse whose been taken prisoner there would be agreeable"
"Envie",2012-04-12,"well okay technically littlefinger might be a pimp but well he is a pimp in a stockholder sense he owns shares and shares and shares of many enterprises including brothels im not sure if we would call a man a baker if he happened to own many enterprises including a bakery littlefinger is also a shipowner he at least owns the merling king the ship he uses to travel to the vale in asos but i guess we do all agree he is not defined by the fact that he owns shipsso breaking littlefinger down to the corepersonality of the pimp is just wrongwell ive always agreed with your outlook on it as well everyone wants to argue but a pimp is a businessman when i tried to point out that baelish is an investor a businessman not a pimp at least from the way he was written in the books he owned ships but wasnt called a captain was he why is it that he owns brothels but is a pimp because hbo decided to make him one its a little piddly argument but the implication is big when its interpreted into the role they clearly wanted the sex drama role adding him as a pimp would bring for many it works and is juicy fun stuff for others it seems out of character to each his ownin the books although yes lf does in fact take catelyn to one of his brothels to have her meet with ned theres never any indication that he spends a lot of his time there or that he takes a hand in its management the way he does in the showin the show hes very hands on to the point of wiping semen off the mouth of a whore as she walks out of a room no im sorry but im not buying the way theyre portraying petyr baelish in the show the actor does a fantastic job in other areas particularly small council varys and ned stark scenes hes spot on the pimp scenes are just not jiving with that"

"Skeksi",2012-04-13,"my thoughts on this scene  better than the scene in the first episode with him and cersei which made him look quite stupid being more concerned about his personal profit than the reason ros is upset is not out of character for littlefinger imo i have a little doubt that lf is going to confess his life story to this woman leave her in charge of the brothels and presumably some spying that goes on there and then threaten her so obviously as people have said lf tends to get his way by making people trust him but i can just about overlook that aspect my main issue with this scene stems from the fact that littlefingerasonlyapimp is kind of becoming more overt yes he owns brothels and yes he hides cat in one he also invests in many other businesses he has installed men loyal to him in several roles in kings landing he buys and sells at a profit he is extraordinarily financially capable which is why he is the master of coin and not only does it explain why he was brought in to do this job despite his low birth it also serves to give us more evidence that littlefinger is very clever and capable otherwise hes just a man who got rich owning brothels which doesnt take a huge amount of financial acumen now i understand that in the books we mostly heard about these through the eyes of other characters such as tyrion however in the books we also dont have him appearing at the brothel every other scene not to mention auditioning prostitutes dealing with customer complaints etc which he surely wouldnt have the time to do we have seen nothing of his other activities despite the fact that if they wanted to expand littlefingers character they could quite easily have shown him selling positions etc i doubt anyone here who doesnt think the scene is entirely fitting with lfs character isnt doing it because they think petyr baelish is really a morally upright righteous dude i think its the way his evilness if you like is portrayed that i think presents an issue he is meant to be not only a skilled player of the game of thrones manipulator of people which got knocked last episode by him threatening cersei but also very skilled with finances and various investments and is instead coming across as someone who got rich through just one enterprise im not sure why they cant seem to get the lf scenes right this season i dont know if its that theyre trying to add in extra stuff for him to do because he is a major character but arent really sure how to go about it or if theyve just decided they cant do without extra nudity and have decided that littlefinger is an easy ticket in that direction i really hope its not the latter as theyve written him pretty well in the past imo and one hopes that when his main arc of the season kicks off which will presumably be negotiating with renly the tyrells theyll right themselves again"

"lyvyathan",2012-04-14,"my thoughts on this scene better than the scene in the first episode with him and cersei which made him look quite stupid being more concerned about his personal profit than the reason ros is upset is not out of character for littlefinger imo i have a little doubt that lf is going to confess his life story to this woman leave her in charge of the brothels and presumably some spying that goes on there and then threaten her so obviously as people have said lf tends to get his way by making people trust him but i can just about overlook that aspectmy main issue with this scene stems from the fact that littlefingerasonlyapimp is kind of becoming more overt yes he owns brothels and yes he hides cat in one he also invests in many other businesses he has installed men loyal to him in several roles in kings landing he buys and sells at a profit he is extraordinarily financially capable which is why he is the master of coin and not only does it explain why he was brought in to do this job despite his low birth it also serves to give us more evidence that littlefinger is very clever and capable otherwise hes just a man who got rich owning brothels which doesnt take a huge amount of financial acumen now i understand that in the books we mostly heard about these through the eyes of other characters such as tyrion however in the books we also dont have him appearing at the brothel every other scene not to mention auditioning prostitutes dealing with customer complaints etc which he surely wouldnt have the time to do we have seen nothing of his other activities despite the fact that if they wanted to expand littlefingers character they could quite easily have shown him selling positions etci doubt anyone here who doesnt think the scene is entirely fitting with lfs character isnt doing it because they think petyr baelish is really a morally upright righteous dude i think its the way his evilness if you like is portrayed that i think presents an issue he is meant to be not only a skilled player of the game of thrones manipulator of people which got knocked last episode by him threatening cersei but also very skilled with finances and various investments and is instead coming across as someone who got rich through just one enterpriseim not sure why they cant seem to get the lf scenes right this season i dont know if its that theyre trying to add in extra stuff for him to do because he is a major character but arent really sure how to go about it or if theyve just decided they cant do without extra nudity and have decided that littlefinger is an easy ticket in that direction i really hope its not the latter as theyve written him pretty well in the past imo and one hopes that when his main arc of the season kicks off which will presumably be negotiating with renly the tyrells theyll right themselves againgood points the only reason why i think were getting more brothel time is because grrm wants to see more of ros snatch its one thing to write about beautiful naked women  its quite another to see them in person i bet hes having the time of his life now"

"Davos55",2012-04-19,"i have thought about that before as well if they are going to play out the whole series it is going to take a long time i am scared as well haha but i hope we dont have to worry about that for a long time"
"Lord Davos Seaworth",2012-04-14,"at first i assumed that davos son shown in the show was devan as he appeared to be stannis squire although i did find it strage that he seemed a little too old but when melisandre whispers into his ear that there is no purer death than by flame i felt that she was foreshadowing his death on the blackwater so is he devan or one of davos older sons or is he perhaps a hybrid of both meant to play devans role but actually die on the blackwater"
"Davos55",2012-04-16,"i was wondering about that too i think he is meant to be one of his older sons who will die on the blackwater i dont know if they will introduce devan or not after that but maybe they could later on this season or next season great name btw davos all the way"
"Thendel",2012-04-17,"i think they just reduced davos number of grownup sons in service to stannis to one called matthos he also seems to take the role of maester pylos as hes also shown writing stannis letter will he die on the blackwater only if they decide to play out davos shortlived plans of murdering mel in the next season which i didnt find very interesting nor vital to the plot and only if bookdevan doesnt have any role to play in any of the last two books"

"Lord Varys",2012-04-10,"yeah the fact many people dislike stannis andor his cause is the fact that he is surroundedsupported by a group of questionableunsympathetic characters ie selyse and ser axell florent and stanniss faction is not that dynamic we still have the kings and queens men in adwd all they had to do is to introduce them its not that they are going anywhere and yes queen selyse does exist but apparently she is not mels most devoted follower and the queens and kings men vying for stanniss ear is actually an interesting background struggle i guess they will have to do this eventually as stannisdavosmel will have virtually nothing to do in season 3 if they truly end up splitting asos into two seasons they can only go to the wall in season 4  after the red and the purple wedding and shireen well she has to appear if shes not there stannis cannot diefake his death in adwdtwow neither selyse nor melisandre could succeed him but as soon as the news of stanniss alleged demise reach the wall shireen will be declared queen if stannis has no heir they would have to rewrite everything if the series even reaches this point of the story edited by lord varys 10 april 2012  0902 am"
"Dr. Pepper",2012-04-10,"im not entirely sure that its necessary to see selyse or shireen we barely see the in the books selyses main function is the book is in bringing stannis around to mels cause or vice versa and shireens main function is to introduce the idea of greyscale and the odd fool patchface who has an uncanny ability to see the future but since no one pays him any attention his ability doesnt really help any yes the power struggle between the king and queens men is interesting in the book but it was basically a struggle between fervent followers of rhollor and those not incline to that belief we have already been shown the beginnings of this divide between matthos and davos as a struggle between elders and young which shows we dont really need to include the idea of kings men and queens men to illustrate the divide if they go the storyline that stannis fakes his own death which isnt even verified in the books yet they still dont have to show shireen just saying he has a daughter is enough to point out that he has a possible heir we didnt see stannis last season yet we were told he existed and that robert had a true heir in him i have to admit though that i was very interested in seeing what sort of homely woman theyd make as stannis wife and how they might have envisioned greyscale to look"

"ViennaGirl",2012-04-10,"if shireen and patchface arent in the show at all then that changes how i think about adwd  ive reread patchfaces weird comments thinking they might mean something regarding the bigger story arc but if grrm is involved in the show and the show writers dont write them in then patchface doesnt mean anything sure its possible theyll appear later but hmmm maybe in the books shireens purpose is to show greyscale and in the show theyll show it in another way if thats even important which i was also assuming but maybe not oh welli love the show anyway  gives us all something to talk about for the next 5 years until the next book"
"dtones520",2012-04-10,"shireen and selyse arent a big part of book two anyways so you can introduce them next season you have a decent number of characters leaving the show after this season or early next with maester luwin rodrick cassel alton lannister cleos frey some random ironborn renly baratheon etc dying you also only have xaro and the warlock in qarth for this season and the pyromancer in kl so thats at least 78 characterscontracts that open next year for shireen selyse the reeds edmure maybe the blackfish ramsay etc remember they have a budget you have to pay a fulltime actor more than you do some glorified extra so some characters have to wait"

"sennahoj",2012-04-10,"granted mels line suggests there is no shireen more than that we learn that the queen is supposedly sickly which also is a difference from the books iirc so could the writers in some way given the sickness be it greyscale or something else entirely to the queen instead having no successor at all may make mels offer to give stannis a son all the more tempting than having a female albeit sick heir already i have no idea how stannis is going to react on the show when he finds out that there is not that much substance to mels promise of a son he could even threaten to put melisandre to the sword for being the witch she is obviously this is just conjecture but couldnt mel offer to use her powers to heal selyse maybe ensure the birth of a living heir which might be shireen i know how that sounds and it would be quite a substantial change from the books but knowing the changes that have been made in the series would it be inconceivable i think not all i am saying is if the series progresses to a point where it will absolutely be necessary for shireen to exist as an heir i am sure they will come up with some sort of plot twist to make it happen the way the series is written makes both the queen and shireen irrelevant at the moment"

"Clariana",2012-04-11,"yeah and the only death quote could be taken as an indirect reference to shireen given that she survived greyscale and should be dead in adwd i think its val who says she should be killed since she considers her to be still contagious or unclean something of that ilk"

"Bastard of Boston",2012-04-12,"i think the producers are being purposefully vague when it comes to stans family the logistics of a tv show do not seem to have a place for an extensive cast and beyond that casting actors to comprise roles which are not going to be vital for 1 or 2 more seasons is also an awkward situation to be in i account this as the reason why certain characters like selyse who is only seen from a distance shireen and damphair on theons end have not been truly revealed on the show i think the producers are trying to leave things with stans family as open and vague as possible this will allow them to introduce the characters later when they feel the characters are truly needed for their narrative and when theres more time to develop them  this season is already stacked with so many new facesmore might be too overwhelming the clever word play mel used referencing only sons also allows the producers time to even decide if shireen is necessary to what theyre doing with the shows narrative i imagine the tv show to be very strategic  seeing how long you can get away with putting off certain character introductions selyse can be locked in her tower all season easily enough if shes sickly and depressed and then be revealed next season played by a wellknown actress they couldnt squeeze in to this season same with shireen and patchface"
"Lord Varys",2012-04-12,"yeah but why not introduce shireen as stanniss daughter and heir by at least mentioning her nobody insisted that shireen play an important role this season id have been content with namedropping only we got lothor brune mentioned and saw him as an extra even randyll tarly was mentioned so they could have mentioned shireen as well she truly is politically important so this smalls more like cutting than mere omitting for the time being although id love to be surprised after all with asos becoming two seasons they have to introduce us to more characters on dragonstone im quite sure edric storm will be introduced in season 3 as stanniss ward not renlys since the whole penrose plot seems to have been dropped as to aeron im quite sure his introduction scene will be his first chapter of affc but set in season 4 of the series since the whole kingsmoot stuff most likely is going to be placed in the season covering the second half of asos but they are most likely going to be mentioning all the greyjoy brothers especially victarion since he is going to separate robb from the north"
"Lord of Brewtown",2012-04-12,"i agree that id be content with namedropping only we dont need to see selyse andor shireen but its a huge mistake to write shireen out of the script if they are changes the character of stannis and theres just really no need to do it that smacks of dd trying too hard to put their stamp on the story"
"Dr. Pepper",2012-04-12,"i disagree that shireen is politically important in general stannis followers barely even consider her existence let alone consider her an actual heir to the throne men arent vying to be betrothed to her with the same voracity we see with other heirs massey even seems confused about why he should continue his quest for sellswords if stannis is rumored to have died shireens narrative importance often doesnt seem that great we learn about greyscale from her but that information doesnt really become useful until adwd and we get patchface who is such a mysterious character because we dont know much about his origins or how he can seem to have prophetic jingles the only truly meaningful dialogue weve had from shireen is that she dreamed of dragons maybe she will become a much more important character in future books but the text so far doesnt suggest that she already is that being said id still like for her to exist on the show even if only by name right now"
"GSP",2012-04-12,"only stillborns only death seems to imply no daughters either imho of course my concerns could be totally off base shireen and patchface very well could remain fairly irrelevant background characters in which case there is no issue but i highly suspect at least one of them comes to greater importance by the end of the series"

"Lord Varys",2012-04-14,"well we should not consider the tv series as authority on story development in the books the fact that there was no speaking jeyne poole in season 1 is not going to change the fact that ramsay is going to marry her as fake arya just as the fact that there as of yet still no tullysreeds in the series is not going to change the importance of say howland reed brynden and edmure tully to the series as to shireens role her greyscale and conningtons in the south is the first hint in my opinion that we will see a plague spreading through westeros but shireens fate might be even worse she will not be burnt but if her greyscale returns mels ritual to save might have interesting consequences remember danys vision of the stone beast breathing shadow fire after we have learned the term stone men its not so unlikely that shireen might be transformed into this stone beast she might still be sane and herself afterwards though remember what moqorro did to victarions arm we should keep in mind that mel is not using stannis and his family she actually seems to likelove stannis and in my opinion this also includes selyse and shireen if selyse begs her to save her daughter even if they all believe stannis is dead which i doubt mel does melisandre will do everything she can edited by lord varys 14 april 2012  0737 am"

"The Mega Sage",2012-04-11,"three major plot points that people seem to have a problem with in episode two are the characterizations of stannis and specifically his quavering a  son comment ros and her nervous breakdown from having watched a baby be killed in front of her and joffrey ordering the male babies of his father killed none of which appeared in the books to the best of my knowledge these are three pretty big changes from the books but instead of assuming the incompetence andor lack of care from the creators by looking at these three scenes and how they work in the context of the entire episode i think its plain to see the changes were done on purpose and for a very specific purposealmost every major plot point in this episode revolved in one way or another around a son dealing with his father i believe that this is a watershed episode in the television series of a game of thrones because it does make so many large character changes but it does it in a way that is consistent within the television world of westeros its obvious the creators arent going to ignore the books and i imagine they will still be very faithful to it but this episode more than any other is where they seem to have stepped out from the lengthy shadow of the books to say we have something to add as well quite a few of these plot points are consistent with the books but its interesting that they placed them all in this particular episode as though  on purposegendry is marked for death because of his fatherwe find that gilly is worried craster will kill her baby if he finds its a sonros is broken up because she watched a son be killed in front of herwe find out joffrey ordered the death of his fathers bastardstheon returns and is put in his place by his fatherdavos and his son have a difference of opinion about religionmelisandre promises stannis a son and he gives in to her a  sonjon follows craster giving his son to a white walkerthose are 8 plot points in a 50 minute episode directly relating to the relationship between fathers and sons or in how people deal with those relationships this is in my opinion something done on purpose by the show creators and because of that i am much more forgiving of the changes they have made from the books these werent changes made simply to be different from the books they are changes which support the theme of episode and to make a more powerful television episode"
"Dr. Pepper",2012-04-12,"ros was broken up over baby barra being killed a bastard daughter not a son so that would make your list 7 points related to fathers and sons but the rest of the points happened in the book and the relationship between sons and fathers was a theme explored in the books i think the frustration is in the presentation of how these scenes play out within the show in the books some of the things on your list are very subtly implied in the show its all explicit the main question within the debates is whether or not the character grrm created int he books is lost on a tv screen where subtly is a very difficult tool to use"
"vinnie1912",2012-04-12,"the ros scene was about little finger just like all ros scenes are about the other characters present it could have easily been a generic whore and it would have been if the writers had not liked the actress so much that they decided to write the character into more scenes"
"TeamDanyArya",2012-04-12,"the theme of fathers and sons is quite strong in books so i think this is a valid thing to explore especially with some of the changes made the show needs to start being looked at seperately from the books i think at this point going forward characters will be cut that will serve no purpose for building upon themes and plot points within the tv show as long as the show doesnt deviate heavily from the books for example spoiler stannis winning the battle of the blackwater or spoiler renly making it through to the end of the season  then its okay to make those changes"
