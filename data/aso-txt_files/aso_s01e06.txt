"Ran",2011-05-22,"rate the episode after it airs and let us know what you think about it"
"Kaitscralt",2011-05-22,"my first ten so far favorite episode yet the theonroz scene felt unnecessary but it was so short that it didnt matter my only minor complaint is how sansa was ridiculously mean to septa mordane and asked questions she should likely know the answer to if she was raised by the woman all her life but i guess the south attitude and being betrothed to a prince is making her cocky"
"Noir Dove",2011-05-22,"i will have to do a rewatch but monday morning employment prevents me from doing so this evening so these musings are first impressions one shots i thought it was for lack of a better word awesomesauce ned had me pulling at my hair and tugging at my heartstrings tyrion was badass as usual see my avatar was really pleased with that whole scene at the eyrie but the events in vaes dothrak stole this week for me dany was just splendid she is becoming so strong and creepy all at the same time i loooove it i would go into more detail but i dont want to spoil anyone the one bug i had about this was the fact that we didnt venture to the wall i understand why this ep was already jam packed but i stilled missed it based on the previews i am certain we will see more of jon sam and the others next week i am not an hbogo lady solid 9 for me bravo"
"tybeechris",2011-05-22,"my first 10 no wasted time i could go on and on but i am sure everyone else will flew by great set ups for everyone renly mormont daenerys tyrion roz guess she will morph into tyrion whore to consolidate characters a little bit of a house tv moment when ned figures it all out from his kids but omg omg omg"

"Lord Godric",2011-05-22,"a solid 9 not as good as last weeks imo but still very good"
"House Snow",2011-05-22,"10 this is also the first episode where none of the scenes went unecessarily long"
"Bowl o' Brown",2011-05-22,"liked the episode but the hunting scene featuring big rob renly ser barristan and lancel walking in the woods was just ridiculous even if he isnt gone for days weeks like in the book i have a hard time believing robert would walk anywhere for any decent length of time hed be sucking air before he found anything to stick his lance into and how long will that tiny wineskin last would it really have been so hard to at least put them on horses or at least start them off near some horses or a small camp and walk into the bush apparently it was so what we get is 4 guys walking through the forest in their court clothes not hunting i get that he doesnt have 20 people following him everywhere when he is in the red keep but when he leaves the castle he needs an entourage id admit its a petty complaint if it wasnt done so well in a previous episode ep2 when robert and ned took a break while on the kingsroad to sit eat and shoot the shit they had a much larger and much more believable entourage thats about as much privacy a king gets when outside of his castlekeep that scene needed some horses some banners a few servants hauling camp gearsupplies a kennel master and some barking dogs to flush out the boars yeah that one scene just went up in price significantly i know dont look at me like that they are the ones who set the bar in episode 2 not me ill give them a pass on the wildling encounter where a bit more entourage would have been nice to see also as i expected summer and grey wind were noshows i get it its hard to get animals to do passable fight choreography ill let others complain about it as theyve been doing since the start of the show aside from that i liked the episode episode 5 was still better imo edited by bowl o brown 22 may 2011  1012 pm"
"Kaitscralt",2011-05-22,"maybe they were in a small section of forest surrounded by roberts men and he had a kg member at his side while he went inside to hunt didnt bother me at all hard to kill a boar with a circus around you"
"Bowl o' Brown",2011-05-22,"robert doesnt actually hunt he is just there to kill something robert stays on horse drinking and complaining while the hunters they brought along find the boars den hole in the ground and flush them out with dogs the king only shows up to kill it when they have one cornered thats what i remember reading at least edited by bowl o brown 22 may 2011  1023 pm"

"tybeechris",2011-05-22,"shae has been castedokay maybe chataya or alayaya saves introducing new character and also tyrion already knows and probably trusts ros"
"Lord Godric",2011-05-23,"okay maybe chataya or alayaya saves introducing new character and also tyrion already knows and probably trusts rosthat is what i am thinking now too there is no other logical explanation to have her meet tyrion previously and then go to kings landing"
"Mr Bean",2011-05-23,"an eight any episode without dire wolves receives an automatic one point deduction if the direwolfs played a pivotal role in the scene and this week there were two wildings which could have been eaten by dire wolves but were not there lack was missed because we got to saw one eat one already half a point point deduction was for ros because that entire episode was very why is this here the other half a point lost because theon and rob once again have a heart to heart but act like assholes to each other not the good friends as described considering how theon is treated in the show to date i dont know why hes fallen into the stark lacky role it makes no sense when everyone treats him like shit every other episode felt required needed or was just awesome could have used a little more mord but what i got was excellent"
"Daenerys",2011-05-23,"8 didnt like the hunt scene every scene sansa is in still sucks ros as good as she is is getting way too much screen time and againno direwolves but viserys coronation and the bronnegan battle were even more awesome than how i pictured it in the book everything else was pretty good to great"
"Carldog",2011-05-23,"liked it i think an eight is in place the lack of d wolves is hurting the show greatly but thats not to say its not moving in the right direction"
"emmank",2011-05-23,"wow that last scene was done so perfectly i gave it a 9 i think it was one of the best if not the best ive seen so far"
"arrowfan",2011-05-23,"great ep gave it a 9 one of the best so far tyrion is just nailing it was a good ned ep too oh and really enjoyed theon actually my badass award goes to him for bullseyeing the wildling this was also the first ep besides the pilot where i really enjoyed the dany scenes that closing scene with viserys getting his golden crown was tense and well done"
"ZornKrieger",2011-05-23,"it got a nine the moment viserys golden crown clanked to the ground awesome"
"Ghost Cat",2011-05-23,"i loved it i didnt mind the missing direwolves as the scene ran well without them also any episode with syrio is a win there was no wasted time or scenes where i was left scratching my head ok roz  theon but as someone already said it was short im not completely pleased with the series relationship between rob  theon my understanding from the books was that they were friends and that rob trusted theon else wise why would he send him where he did later my take was that theon was treated fairly and equally with the trueborn stark children thats a minor criticism and it didnt decrease the value of the episode for me the high points were so high im going to miss harry lloyd but that ending was excellent edited by ghost cat 23 may 2011  0439 am"
"Loras",2011-05-23,"810 i enjoyed this episode but it didnt quite have the magic of last weeks installment the highpoints for me this episode were in the danaerys storyline while i still think emilia clarke needs to grow into the role she had some excellent moments tonight my favourite scene was the horse heart scene beautifully realised harry lloyd also did a wonderful job with viserys final episode i am going to miss him but i am ready for the change of focus in danys story as we amp up towards the finale one thing that bugged me with this episode was the lighting  in the hunting scene and the sansajoff scene particularly"
"Popgun",2011-05-23,"910 i liked last weeks episode slightly better but this week was almost as good i loved the part where ned denounced sir gregor and ordered tywin lannister to kings landing plus the crowning at the end was great was surprisedthey didnt include loras offering ned to hunt down gregor for him whouldve tied in well with the bj scene of last week where loras was plotting away with renly"
"John (Snow) Doe",2011-05-23,"9 a welcome balance of dialogue and action and within the dialogue both exposition and plot advancement im really enjoying how the winterfell scenes focus more on theon  i find him generally more interesting than robb and i think theyve cast him perfectly the dany storylines are gaining some welcome momentum thanks to clever directing  they no longer feel like a needless sideplot mad props on using the title of the episode to allude to both neds revelation of roberts heirs and viserys ultimate fate best episode yet imo"
"reiver",2011-05-23,"i loved the episode but there were a few things missing that would have made it even better i understand the lack of the wolves in the fight for purposes of getting the dogs to behave but they could still have had them tearing at the corpses or finishing off a downed man as he tried to rise surely getting a dog to eat sausages dressed to look like intestines isnt beyond the dog wranglers and if it is then hire better ones it would have made the scene bloodier and more horrific and would have kept the wolves there as characters at the moment id be suprised if many viewers even remember them robb and theon was again a bit too much we get that theon isnt a stark we get that he resents his position but theyre overegging the pudding to the extent that theons betrayal is an inevitability it was quite shocking in the books and im sad how much of that they will have lost in trying to justify and explain it early i loved the fight in the eyrie and liked that they managed to tell a lot of the story visually id have liked the contrast in armour to have been a bit more pronounced bronns was spot on but ser vardis looked too lightly armoured for the contrast i suppose thats very much a book geek quibble and something that wont even flit across the mind of a viewer but its something that i feel would have added to the scene without any effort my favourite so far i gave it a 9"
"TheEvilKing",2011-05-23,"definitely 10 for me so many holy shit moments even though i already knew what would happen the targaryens owned this one"
"The Anti-Targ",2011-05-23,"yeah the minute or so spent with roz and theon could have been better spent on actual events of the story osha came of as rather gollumish we swears to serve the master if you spares us our life the scene as a whole was ok but i was looking to see a direwolf there i really hope we see a bit more of the dire wolves golden crown was golden seeing the heart eating was great showing aryas needle prowess even while distracted with her troubles marvellous just one more scene with syrio i fear gosh such a pity would have loved to see some more dancing lessons good opening scene no doubt second watch will be even better 8 from me"
"thistlepong",2011-05-23,"i liked this one it had some flaws and im missing the direwolves because i know theyre supposed to be there and not going to be but they laid off the scenes that were nothing but exposition masked by sex or violence and allowed the story to tell itself 9"
"Zezibesh",2011-05-23,"ive been pretty conservative with the numbers so far but this was definitely an 8 brilliant episode they just keep improving edited by zezibesh 23 may 2011  0754 am"
"StrongBelwas",2011-05-23,"low moments and high moments low moments i was not pleased to see the moon door in the floor as soon as i saw what they were doing i knew that it had been placed there specifically for the obligatory moment in a fight scene when two opponents are locked in combat and leaning against the void and what do you know there was bronn for a moment pressed against the brink the little moments when hollywood intrudes upon martins story upset me they pull me out of my belief suspension why havent we seen the specifics to vaes dothrak where are all the looted momuments part of what made vaes dothrak engaging were the shadows of dead gods and fallen kings scattered upon plains grass i think our filmakers dropped a ball here high moments the speech delivered by eddard in regards to gregor clegan was completely excellent bravo i also want to acknowledge harry lloyd for a moment now that we will not be seeing him again i felt that he nailed his character perfectly even though danys brother is a man we like to hate every moment he was on screen matched the character described in got i hope harry gets more work quickly"
"Ferrum Aeternum",2011-05-23,"superb from start to finish this is what i envisioned this tv show being when it was first announced several years ago no major complaints and nothing this week that felt like fillerim not completely pleased with the series relationship between rob  theon my understanding from the books was that they were friends and that rob trusted theon else wise why would he send him where he did later my take was that theon was treated fairly and equally with the trueborn stark childrenits necessary so that theons turn of the cloak in season 2 will make sense if he and robb were all buddy buddy right now with no conflicts between them his change of heart next year would feel much too rushed and random externalizing conflict is one of the unfortunate consequences of any tv adaptation of a written work edited by ser helman tallhart 23 may 2011  0838 am"

"valacirca",2011-05-23,"my first 10 of the season i loved the episodethishavent said it yet but im saying it now best episode yet"
"Huan",2011-05-23,"910 i am going to miss harry lloyd going forward he was brilliant in this episode managing to convey viserys bewilderment and resentment at the love for dany and convincing me to feel sorry for the boy who would be king by the end fantanstic crowning scene the hunting scene left me cold and i am tired of ros already but everything else was good i was expecting no direwolves in the wood so wasnt disappointed"
"maxlongstreet",2011-05-23,"best yet i say more jane espenson next season this was written better than the dd episodes in my view  hardly a wrong word in it anything you could find fault with in the episode  lack of wolves not enough people in the hunt etc  had nothing to do with the writing"
"Bronn Stone",2011-05-23,"best yet i say more jane espenson next season this was written better than the dd episodes in my view  hardly a wrong word in it anything you could find fault with in the episode  lack of wolves not enough people in the hunt etc  had nothing to do with the writingi thought the episode had the single clunkiest bit of poorly constructed exposition in the series to date there had to be a better way for littlefinger to remind the audience that catelyns family sigil is a fish than pretending to be confused about it it doesnt make sense in the context of a ploy either of course lf knows the little twit grew up there and eddard knows he knows genuinely painful on the ears could have been much more effective with a slap in the face of your wifes father  mocking his very sigilfor that and poor direction i can only go as high as 8 the wolves issue and the hunt issue could have and should have been resolved with a glimpse of the wolves chasing someone into the brush and sound effects handling the rest if you hear the sounds of the hunt in the distance you havent spent much money but you make the scene bigger all the same if you hear the wolves savaging wildlings you know it happened and you understand later when osha is so damned afraid of the things"
"Starkess",2011-05-23,"i thought the episode had the single clunkiest bit of poorly constructed exposition in the series to date there had to be a better way for littlefinger to remind the audience that catelyns family sigil is a fish than pretending to be confused about it it doesnt make sense in the context of a ploy either of course lf knows the little twit grew up there and eddard knows he knows genuinely painful on the ears could have been much more effective with a slap in the face of your wifes father  mocking his very sigilive heard a couple complaints about this and i dont get it at all to me the comment played off very much as a tauntjab at ned ie remember your wife recently upset the lannisters what a coincidence that its her familys sigil"
"reiver",2011-05-23,"its necessary so that theons turn of the cloak in season 2 will make sense if he and robb were all buddy buddy right now with no conflicts between them his change of heart next year would feel much too rushed and random externalizing conflict is one of the unfortunate consequences of any tv adaptation of a written worksome of the previous groundwork was necessary were at the stage where were being beaten about the head with it now to the extent that its ridiculous that they allow theon to even have a bow if hes so much an outcast and prisoner let alone sent off as a trusted envoy im now thinking theons capture of winterfell within the context of this adaptation would not even be the slightest betrayal whereas in the book i had a fair bit of dissonance about it"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-23,"some of the previous groundwork was necessary were at the stage where were being beaten about the head with it now to the extent that its ridiculous that they allow theon to even have a bow if hes so much an outcast and prisoner let alone sent off as a trusted envoy im now thinking theons capture of winterfell within the context of this adaptation would not even be the slightest betrayal whereas in the book i had a fair bit of dissonance about ittheon is trying to make robert go to war for the honor of the starks and he has said that he would stand by his side just as robb already knows thats in essence about as much as the book tells us about his loyalty only in more examples none of the other starks seem to have any fondness for theon they seem to see him as cocky arrogant and annoying or just ignore him altogetheri dont feel that it makes it strange that hes allowed to go as he pleases they are just telling back story and explaining a character that will become important if the show doesnt alter the story from the book well even see first hand that he had no intentions whatsoever to betray robb when he went to his father its his father that has the plan and theon then acts to get his fathers approval because hes just found out that no one cares about him anymore and everyone sees him as someone the starks has made into a soft weakling thats not worthy to be lord of the iron islands"
"Icebreaker",2011-05-23,"i gave it 6 the 5th episode was the best so far imo so this one was a bit of a letdown for me i dont know perhaps im not being objective it is all very painful for me to watch when i know how it will end for the good boys overall im happy with the fighting scenes which seem quite realistic and brutal although some of the characters arent depicted as i had imagined them  bronn for example he is atleast 1015 years older than he should be ser vardis even more so on the other hand another fantastic performance from peter dinklage brilliant actor he really is the star of the series for me edited by icebreaker 23 may 2011  0447 pm"
"Renasko",2011-05-23,"810 pretty good episode not quite reaching perfect marks though figure the second season will improve theyll learn from their mistakes more direwolves less exposition a little more lannister gold should be sweet"
"Daenerys",2011-05-23,"robb and theon was again a bit too much we get that theon isnt a stark we get that he resents his position but theyre overegging the pudding to the extent that theons betrayal is an inevitability it was quite shocking in the books and im sad how much of that they will have lost in trying to justify and explain it earlyi agree im almost finding myself rooting for theon first of all he may be a bit of a cocky wanker but at least hes got a personality and some humor compare to robb who seems to have the personality of a cardboard box second all the starks treat him like shit seemingly for no reason thats not the impression i got from the books yes hes a greyjoy and his family tried to rebel but he was obviously a child at the time and should not be held accountable for that the only scenes in the tv series where he seems a part of the stark family is when hes joking around with the stark boys when they get haircuts and when hes present when cat tells the small winterfell group about the treachery of the lannisters other than they why wouldnt he hate the starks i actually loved it when robb asked him where bran is he said its not my house and stalked off and even there he still came back and saved their assesso yeah its not going to have the same surprise or impact when heyou know"
"YoDaddy",2011-05-23,"giving it a 6 i cant decide if im too much of a fanboy to be so dissapointed in certain elements that stray from the books or if those constantly passing out 10s are"
"YoDaddy",2011-05-23,"oh and does anyone else find themselves singing satisfaction whenever theon enters a room could he look more like mick jagger"
"Bronn Stone",2011-05-24,"overall im happy with the fighting scenes which seem quite realistic and brutal although some of the characters arent depicted as i had imagined them  bronn for example he is atleast 1015 years older than he should be ser vardis even more so on the other hand another fantastic performance from peter dinklage brilliant actor he really is the star of the series for medinklage is 41  18 years older than tyrion but you are okay with that in the books catelyn estimates that ser vardis egen to be about fifteen years older than bronn so if this bronn is 15 years older than the one in the books truth is hes closer to 20 that would mean brendan mccormack should be about sixty i cant find his actual age but hes clearly not sixty probably a good bit younger than jerome flynn"

"Holymoly",2011-05-24,"im not completely pleased with the series relationship between rob  theon my understanding from the books was that they were friends and that rob trusted theon else wise why would he send him where he did later my take was that theon was treated fairly and equally with the trueborn stark childrenive been rereading the first book after a few years and must say that i am surprised how i am picking up a different take on theon second time around first time reading through the books i think you miss much of the nuances the author included as you werent neccessarily aware of the future importance of seemingly innocuous commentsoccurences when i read through the first time theons story was very surprising for me as it devloped however second time of reading and the wildling scene in particular you get the suggestion of a certain cavalier flippant attitude towards the stark children that wouldnt be expected if they were blood relations in the book robb is incredibly angry with theon for taking the shot the tv series is using a slightly blunter instrument to make the point however i believe that it is a point present in the book"
"Greywolf2375",2011-05-24,"910 actually over a 9 but not perfect there are some things i still dislike about how the stories are being adjusted  theonroz didnt fit well  some other minor quibbles but to me this has been the best episode so far if i can ever get hbo go to work maybe the next will bump it up a notch but this was the peak to this point for me"
"Hombre de Murcielago",2011-05-24,"910 great episode but not quite perfect maisie williams and peter dinklage continue to nail every scene they are in but im consistently disappointed when sansa or draco malfoy joffrey are in a scene the lack of direwolves during the fight in the woods was also a disappointment overall the series appears to have finally picked up momentum and this episode did an excellent job of keeping it going"
"Abaddon",2011-05-24,"gave this one a 9 id say its my highest 9 yet maybe a 93 or 94 very close to giving an episode a 95  10 and i think that in eps 810 there should be some great opportunities to do so"
"SFA-OK",2011-05-25,"710 solid like in all previous episodes there were some unnecessary changes and scenes really not a fan of how they continue to portray theon its like who cares if and when he becomes a dick he already is way too onedimensional for my liking didnt like the change to the moon door just so they could add a cliche into the bronn fight sean bean was once again one of the big highlights not a fan so far of littlefinger or really anyone else in the kings council those characters and the intrigue was much more interesting in the book so far tyrion lannister is great once again the crowning scene was done really well but when you start feeling bad for viserys there might be something wrong in the book i didnt feel bad for the character at all its strange how they made viserys into a somewhat semisympathetic character but theon is a complete douche who you feel nothing for i actually didnt mind the sansa scene the jeoffrey cast is great that actor is creepy"
"Songlian",2011-05-25,"8 i liked it a lot viserys again stole the show for me many great scenes overall they keep being too obvious with things and its beginning to bother me a little dany and the dragon eggs dany and the fire thing theon and his imminent betrayal is it even betrayal at this point given how much crap he gets from everyone baratheon and the golden hair etc all these things came as surprises in the books now theyre so obvious its painful otherwise good episode"
"Davieboy",2011-05-26,"my verdict is a 9 i thought it covered a lot of ground well with fab performances all round i actually think alfie allen is capturing theon very well  i can easily imagine him in the events we know are coming up in the future esp his initial meeting with asha a real highlight for me harry lloyds viserys deserves all the plaudits its receiving enjoyed the bronn fight  i always imagined sean bean in his sharpe persona as bronn whilst reading the books loved mord  could not resist telling my wife about the gold teeth he later acquires probably the only spoiler ive given her shes never read the book and positively loves the show as do all her workmates she convinced to watch based on my sayso danys story is her favorite part downsides  as sfaok says above the kings council is lacking something i dont recognise renly on tv as the renly in the books and littlefinger one of my fave characters hasnt really shone yet early days for him i guess and varys is fine so far i guess its just renly as always the end of the show is a huge wrench back to reality watching from ep 1 tonight as my friend from oz is over  i have to do my bwb duty"
"The Fan",2011-05-26,"they keep being too obvious with things and its beginning to bother me a littlethis is more than a little grating to me as well i cannot tell if its due to the fact i have read the books or because they dd believe that the american audience perhaps rightly have no appreciation of any subtlety renlyloras and the slurping littlefinger and ned in the throne room among a few others i have purged from memoryi did really enjoy episode 6 the crowning scene was really the crown of the episode harry lloyd played viserys the mad brilliantly right to point he pitches forward gildedas for the theon bit in the books i was under the impression that robb jon and theon of similar age were brotherly rivals even though theon was not a stark he was not mistreated or mistrusted how they are portraying it when he travels as an envoy it is his poor experience running into asha that i had thought causes him to decide to well we know what he doesand the direwolves where oh where are the direwolves i started a topic called hbo got where are the direwolves to discuss it but the wildlingbran scene was one of the best scenes where the direwolves earn their keep couple that glaring omission with the vaguely wolflike dogs they were forced to use stupid irish wild animal laws and what was a terrific aspect to the books is barely a footnote in the show as near as i can tell the only characters in the show aware that the wolves exist are brans throatless assassin sansa and joffrey drygif classbbcemoticon alt "

"zippypoodle",2011-05-28,"an eightany episode without dire wolves receives an automatic one point deduction if the direwolfs played a pivotal role in the scene and this week there were two wildings which could have been eaten by dire wolves but were not there lack was missed because we got to saw one eat one alreadyhalf a point point deduction was for ros because that entire episode was very why is this here the other half a point lost because theon and rob once again have a heart to heart but act like assholes to each other not the good friends as described considering how theon is treated in the show to date i dont know why hes fallen into the stark lacky role it makes no sense when everyone treats him like shit every other episode felt required needed or was just awesome could have used a little more mord but what i got was excellenti guess we all have different things we expect from the show so im not going to criticize your position which seems to be that every variation from the books rates a deduction thats a valid way to watch the seriesi take a different tack when changes are made i take both into account and decide which i like better sometimes its the book version other times its the show version when it comes to the theonrobb interaction you mention i am liking the way theon is presented in the show much more than in the book theons sudden turn in the book while explained to some extent by his desire to prove himself to he iron island people never quite sat right with me see this slightly more antagonistic relationship between theon and the starks makes is all work better things add up robbs comment that its not theons house maester lewins snarky comment about failed rebellions tyrions mocking of theon who had no response to tyrions comments etc and even with this it still makes sense that robb would send theon to treat with his father im also liking show cersei bettershe seems a little more human otoh i think book sansa is much better i didnt like her being bitchy to the septa"

"NW Deserter",2011-05-28,"what exactly is bronn supposed to be in the tv series in agot hes definitely a mercenary hired by catelyn so its not particularly shocking that hed fight for tyrion or use dirty tactics to beat vardis in the series however no mention is made of what exactly bronn is hes roughlooking and roughfighting but he could pass for a hedge knight just scraping by lysas court seems to be shocked at how dishonorably he fights no way for a knight i think gets said at some point so i thought that whole bit was weirdi noticed this too in the otakuassemble episode reviews on youtube that im sure were all familiar with by now the guy thought he was a member of the nights watchand i dont think hes even been officially named yet either maybe theyll put in some dialogue between him and tyrion on the eastern road that will shed some light on tvbronns history and motives"
"zippypoodle",2011-05-28,"710didnt like the change to the moon door just so they could add a cliche into the bronn fight the crowning scene was done really well but when you start feeling bad for viserys there might be something wrong in the book i didnt feel bad for the character at all its strange how they made viserys into a somewhat semisympathetic character but theon is a complete douche who you feel nothing for i cut out the parts i didnt want to respond to of whats left i thought when i first saw it that i would agree with you that oh instead of bronn using a different style to defeat ser vardis theyre going to be lame and have him trick him into falling through the hole and then they didnt they actually showed the fight pretty much as id pictured it and only had him shove him through the hole at the end so i ended up liking itand i agree that viserys is somewhat more sympathetic here but i attribute it to being able to actually see just how pathetic he is he has all these delusions of grandeur but is just a pathetic little man in more ways than one and i dont care how bad a person is seeing him sitting there waiting for gold to get poured over his head youd have to be pretty cold not to feel something for him even if as i do you feel it was deserved"

"SerArthurHeath",2011-05-28,"i find it interesting that some people keep saying that they dont like how theon is coming across as so much of a dock so early as opposed to his first scene in the book where its pretty clear hes a douchebag and others say that hes being treated so harshly that hes sympathetic andor his betrayal is inevitable a these seem to be practically if not opposite criticisms once again and i tend to think that if people can throw polar opposite criticisms at the same thing what it actually signifies is that they are being very over sensitive and the actual portrayal is very good coolgif classbbcemoticon altb  im fairly sure he is portrayed as a dick an outsider and sympathetically in the books we didnt see much of him in book 1 just like jaime but he definitely had these traits and the tv show not having povs is third person omniscient where we were always going to get earlier and more accurate complexities in character than in the books also because a 10 hour tv show will effectively go at a much faster pace than its source book all development must start earlier in order to not seem like inconsistency thats not hard to grasp c i dont think his betrayal will be too obvious to tv viewers some will get it but some people guessed that ned was doomed or that hed betray the starks in the books that doesnt mean they all will the signs ate there to see because of the differences in the pace of revealing information and the speed at which things happen and scenes change it has to be more obvious in the show otherwise the signs would not be there and having something happen as an absolute shock with no clues at least having more than one thing happen is imo awful writing thats why foreshadowing is s universal literary technique its clear in retrospect in the books why theon betrayed the starks if it werent it would appear to be a cheap change in characterisation as a form on deusdiabolis ex machina the same applies in the show they are mediums that run with a different pace and a different viewpoint that seems to me to account for all perceived differences in characterisation except renly but he was dull in the book so feel free to make him interesting"
"Bronn Stone",2011-05-29,"the fight between ser vardis and bronn was great but there was one thing i found weird about the whole situation what exactly is bronn supposed to be in the tv series in agot hes definitely a mercenary hired by catelyn so its not particularly shocking that hed fight for tyrion or use dirty tactics to beat vardis in the series however no mention is made of what exactly bronn is hes roughlooking and roughfighting but he could pass for a hedge knight just scraping by lysas court seems to be shocked at how dishonorably he fights no way for a knight i think gets said at some point so i thought that whole bit was weirdif bronns relationship with catelyn is ever formalized we arent privy to that fact as far as we know he is a sellsword who has fallen in with her it may be she does hire him but it may be like the freeriders who attach themselves to the royal train hes just going along hoping for a reward at the bottom of the route up to the eyrie she specifically notes that he has not acknowledged her authority so i suspect the latter is more likely"
"Ealdorman Halasahr",2011-05-30,"clearly a good episode 8 out of 10 no problem but as my friend pointed out when a king goes hunting how many people does he bring with him one guard one wineskin holder and  well how many would you bring if you were a king my suggestion was that the hbo budget for the episode had run its course and that they couldnt include an entire entourage"

"Vuron",2011-05-23,"it has to be heavy handed due to the medium of tv it becomes hard to follow subtle clues when you condense 6 chapters into one episode and only air 1 per week have you read or watched any of the reviewsdiscussions from nonbook readers there are still a large number of people that dont know the names of some of the main characters or how theyre related to each other is it better to get the renlyloras relationship out of the way now or to have a scene in every episode that hints at it personally id like to see the major plots of the story shown on the screen instead than to have a large number of scenes hinting at all the revelations that will be revealed later most of which arent important to the overall story"

"aimlessgun",2011-05-23,"theon agree here it wont even seem like a betrayal at this point it will just seem like theon simply got free from captivity and it will make robb look like a complete moron for sending him and he didnt seem so smart doing that in the books dragon eggs were there doubts about whether they would hatch in the books serious question i dont remember what i thought talking through the hair it had to be said out loud at some point i dont think this was a bad way to do it i took those as lf being cheeky to ned rather than actual attempts at helpful commentsyeah it felt like petyr being a dick as opposed to just being info for the viewer edited by aimlessgun 23 may 2011  1220 pm"

"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-23,"its a pretty funny contradiction that we have fans saying that the show moves along too fast for the nonreader audience to get it and we have fans saying that the show is too heavyhanded the truth is probably in the middle with the first group underestimating the nonreaders perception and the second group underestimating how much their experience changes their own perceptions its of course not the most subtle of tv shows but my own experience with the nonreaders people i know and things i watchread on the internet is also that they get everything important but the general viewers arent seeing much of whats coming before it hits them other than guesses from standard storytelling etcthe show is putting out a ton of information the tss notion that they have only left the important parts is just wrong in my view and its obvious that the nonreaders wont grasp everything without watching it a few times the show must thus point on the important parts more so what the nonreaders grasp is sure to include everything important a reader will of course already know everything so grasping the information is far easier for them which means that the emphasis on the important details will be much more blatant the same goes for the book where youre sure to miss several details on the first time but things get much easier on a reread despite that books are generally more subtle than tv when judging comparable worksmy impression of other great shows including other hbo ones like rome or deadwood has often been that when ive watched them a second time with someone thats seeing it for the first time i often felt unsure if i just missed things now that they seem so apparent and always fear that the other viewer is going to pick up on everything just because everything is so much more obvious on the second run of course they never do its just my perception thats alteredtheon getting pissed on and constantly reminded of his hostage status his betrayal wont come as any great surprise also removing him kicking the head makes him seem a lot more sympathetic than he actually isthis seems a bit contradictory you say they make him too obvious a traitor and too sympathetic since when is treachery a sympathetic deed theon is a hostage in both book and show thats no different unless they change it in the show he didnt intend to betray robb either until his father had different ideas and theon found out that he was seen as a soft weakling that had no right to the iron islands theres nothing subtle about that theon was a risk for robb in the book either as catelyn is very clear about how foolish it was to send theon instead of someone else"

"Skillet",2011-05-23,"one place where i wish theyd been more subtle is with theonnonbook reader friends of mine have already surmised that hes going to turn on the starksi remember being completely thrown off by theons betrayal and in fact after finishing got the first time i dont think i even recalled who he was i think the show shouldve kept that same mysteriousness and really develop his character s2this is one of the places where i think the direction of the show points to clues about the future of the book series i had wondered about that when i first started watching the show only grrm knows how it is all going to end so he knows what must be properly introduced to viewers for example my current guess is that the absence of neds dreamsflashbacks in the show probably means that all of the posters who dwell on rlj might have it completely wrong and are severely overestimating the importance of neds book thoughts on the other hand if future episodes throw in references to promise me ned then maybe ill change my mind with regards to theon after reading agot i assumed he was a minor character at best during acok i figured i was wrong and he would actually turn out to be important by the end of acok he is seemingly killed off and i assumed i was mistaken after all and that in fact he was just a temporary storyline now i have to change my mind a third time from watching the tv series it seems clear that grrm has something important in mind for theon theres no way the show would have focused so much attention on him just to set up his initial betrayal i think his storyline is going to continue until the bitter end"

"Trinket",2011-05-24,"the show is very heavy handed and i dont agree that it has to be because of the medium it is a complex plot involving many people but the information that the viewer needs can be conveyed in less blatant manner such as valacirca suggests having your characters talk loud to themselves in order to get the idea across like in the dark of hair part is pretty poor imo even if i really like the series and of course the books i doubt i would have enjoyed the series this much if i hadnt read the books though considering the heavy handedness having to spell things out easily comes across as silly"
"Anomandaris86",2011-05-24,"in the books gregor burns people alive inside a keep when he is pillagingnot to mention that we already know he is capable of dashing a babys head against the wall and then raping and killing the babys mother with its brains and blood still on his hands theres pretty much nothing gregor is incapable of doinganyway as far as the riverland raiding is concerned tywin admits that the purpose of it was to draw ned out into battle as such making it brutal is more likely to get neds attention and im sure tywin knew this for all we know he gave special instruction to gregor to be particularly brutaldisagree i think it plays extremely similar to the books you know the answers so it seems more heavy handed and repetitive than it is the books are actually much much more heavy handed we just notice it lessi think the issue is that the books have so many extra details in them that it isnt always apparent which ones are really important so while they may have the same amount of heavyhandedness on certain things as the show they naturally dont come across as such due to simple dilution of course for the show they have to trim a lot of fat maybe this is unavoidable due to the medium but i still think there are a few things they could have done betteron the other side though they seem to be lighterhanded on some of the other things like littlefinger they seem to really want his betrayal to come as a surprise theyve had plenty oppurtunities for tyrion to say that the dagger isnt his and that he would never bet against jaime but those have been carefully omitted which means he also doesnt get to call littlefinger out ill have you know lady stark that it is not your hand he speaks of so theyre definitely wanting people to think littlefinger is on the side of the starks in the books it was fairly obvious that littlefinger was full of shit at least as far as the dagger was concerned"
"fall from grace",2011-05-24,"its a pretty funny contradiction that we have fans saying that the show moves along too fast for the nonreader audience to get it and we have fans saying that the show is too heavyhanded the truth is probably in the middle with the first group underestimating the nonreaders perception and the second group underestimating how much their experience changes their own perceptions its of course not the most subtle of tv shows but my own experience with the nonreaders people i know and things i watchread on the internet is also that they get everything important but the general viewers arent seeing much of whats coming before it hits them other than guesses from standard storytelling etcthe show is putting out a ton of information the tss notion that they have only left the important parts is just wrong in my view and its obvious that the nonreaders wont grasp everything without watching it a few times the show must thus point on the important parts more so what the nonreaders grasp is sure to include everything important a reader will of course already know everything so grasping the information is far easier for them which means that the emphasis on the important details will be much more blatant the same goes for the book where youre sure to miss several details on the first time but things get much easier on a reread despite that books are generally more subtle than tv when judging comparable worksmy impression of other great shows including other hbo ones like rome or deadwood has often been that when ive watched them a second time with someone thats seeing it for the first time i often felt unsure if i just missed things now that they seem so apparent and always fear that the other viewer is going to pick up on everything just because everything is so much more obvious on the second run of course they never do its just my perception thats alteredthis seems a bit contradictory you say they make him too obvious a traitor and too sympathetic since when is treachery a sympathetic deed theon is a hostage in both book and show thats no different unless they change it in the show he didnt intend to betray robb either until his father had different ideas and theon found out that he was seen as a soft weakling that had no right to the iron islands theres nothing subtle about that theon was a risk for robb in the book either as catelyn is very clear about how foolish it was to send theon instead of someone elsei agree i really dont think i could follow half of what is going on in the tv series if i hadnt read the books i think things have to be more obvious if the television audience even has a chance of keeping up with the plots i hear a lot of complaints about the theon story line but i was uncertain of who he was until about halfway through book one so it seemed like his story came out of nowhere in book two i really like how they have developed theon more in the tv series yeah it wont be much of a surprise when theon turns on the starks but was it ever really a surprise catelyn never wanted rob to send theon as the messenger also i think it is good to make theon more sympathetic winterfell is not his home  he doesnt have a place there but then come to find out he no longer has a place at his real home either dunno it works for meas far as ned reading the book aloud i didnt see it as being heavy handed i assume it was that he finally got it i would think that the television audience would have clued in before then seeing that we were privy to what bran caught jamie and cersei doing at winterfell the few people i know that havent read the books but are watching the tv series pretty much got that right off the bat ned was the one who needed a child to point out the obvious lolgif classbbcemoticon altlol "

"Vestrit",2011-05-24,"hmm think some of you are being a touch too critical herei agree that the handling of loras  renly was really really annoying and totally overthetop now theres no way people would have picked up on it from the tv show if it was anywhere near as subtle as in the book and the shaving scene was perhaps necessary in terms of setting up renlys later move to be king but the seachange from a really subtlyhandled sideline to the plot to an over top scene with slurping etc was pretty rubbishthat bit aside i dont think the series has been overthetop or heavyhanded of course it seems that way to a bookreader but remember that whether you realise it or not youre actively looking for the clues most people are just trying to absorb the story and the clues will only make sense to them later on or on a rewatch viewers will miss a lot of things that are right in front of them  for example the makers of the sixth sense thought that they had gone too far with their clues and had given it all away and yet the ending still blindsided everybody its blindingly obvious on a rewatch but ive yet to meet anyone who clocked it on the first watch cue a bunch of internet heroes saying they got itas for lf naming gregor again it may seem heavyhanded to a book reader but without it being spelled out how would a virgin viewer connect the person being described to a character they saw briefly a few episodes ago the horse killing is the only clue there and again youre asking for quite some recall for someone who saw that scene a few weeks back now and a lot has happened since leaving it at dont we know someone of that description wasnt going to be enough  the viewer would be left thinking christ ive met about 50odd characters in the last five weeks can you just tell me who it isand as for ned reading out the entries in the lineage book could someone suggest how else this scene could have been handled well a voiceover of him thinking would have been lame he had to come to the conclusion whilst alone having him say it out loud to another person in the room would have been too much of a departure because then youve got the question of who would he say it to and anyway if they did do that the moaners would just complain that the scene was an unnecessary infodump the writers cant win rolls eyes edited by vestrit 24 may 2011  1128 am"

"MountainThatRides",2011-05-29,"the problem is that in the books most of the revelations and plot points are revealed or expanded upon through the narrative that is to say the interior monologue of the character whose point of view the chapter is voiceovers for personal thought in the visual medium are really only acceptable for exposition and then they are often limited to the very beginning for introduction or the very end summation and epilogue the fact that asoiaf is told through the eyes of many characters is a fantastic thing but only on the page we get to see different perspectives different factions and peek into the mind and thought processes of wildly varying characters take for instance the sharp tonal contrast between tyrion and arya chapters even though you can tell stylistically that theyre both written by the same author we lose all of that in the show and those methods account for a great deal of martins plot pacing and dramatic tension you see very clearly where characters realize something or make a decision or even recap past events to shed new light on them the producers of the television show have to tell the same story  and though its condensed and trimmed down the expansive and intricate plot seems to be staying faithfully intact  without that they have to use different tricks like characters talking to themselves the show can be fairly blunt ill agree but theres no possible way they can achieve the same subtlety of the books the story is just way too big there needs to be a whole lot of stuff crammed into each episode to keep it moving fluidly and they arent going to be able to bring every hint and nuance from the page to screen theyre doing a good job thus far and i think the show is only going to get better the first book in terms of story is barely an appetizer compared to the second and third volumes the only thing that ever irks me is their unrelenting explanation of things that are in no way integral things that didnt even exist in the book like a certain redheaded lady of the night"
"Timbits",2011-06-19,"weve read the books my wife who hasnt didnt catch on to joffrey et al being jaimes children until last nights episode when ned was going through the book of lineages paraphrasing whys he going on about the hair ohhhh joffrey is jaimes son so it may seem heavyhanded to us but not to the median viewer yup"
"dark  sister",2012-01-05,"as someone who has read the books certain scenes definitely seem heavyhanded but to someone whos never read them it might even be too subtle i tried to watch this show with my mom and she was asking me questions literally every two minutes i told her to just wait until the end to ask questions and she still had so many she just couldnt understand it while she isnt the best at understanding fantasy but somehow shes totally fine with understanding the show the tudors which i think is almost as complicated i realized while watching with her that the world of asoiaf is just sooooooooo incredibly detailed now that i think about it im not sure how nonreaders understand the show my main complaint with this episode is when dany says out loud fire cannot kill a dragon right after viserys is killed i thought it sounded pretty stupid  and kinda cruel and uncaring too in the book that thought is internal i wish they had done a voiceover or something bc its just hard to swallow someone seeing something that horrific and immediately saying that snarky comment aloudis it just me also in general i dont like the added scenes that arent in the books i hate hate the sex scene where the two women are going at it and littlefinger is talking to himself while they eat each other out  am i the only person who cringed there and the addition of the characterwhore roz was so unnecessary those scenes accomplished absolutely nothing and added nothing to the plot  it seemed so obvious that it was a gratuitous ta scene for people who wanted to see nudity the way theyre portraying the 3eyedcrow is all wrong too grrm himself said that dream sequences can seem corny on tv but i actually think it wouldve been fantastic  esp when bran sees the curtain of light the dragons all the other symbols etc instead we keep seeing this shot of bran walking in the yard and seeing this crow flap over to a statue any nonreader wont know wtf is going onwhereas a dream would explain things beautifully it makes me think that theyre going to take out the 3ec storyline and the reeds altogetherwhich would basically ruin brans storyline as well"

"Drogon's Personal Trainer",2012-03-08,"as someone who actually watched the series before reading the books this topic seems the best place to make my first post i actually watched the rerun of the series on sky atlantic over christmas as i had never watched the first showing ive read a number of posters here saying that no one who hadnt read the books would have understood bran and the threeeyed crow im afraid i have to respectfully disagree it was somewhat obvious to me that here was a threeeyed crow with crucially a third eye in the middle of his head  thus a symbol of psychic powersecond sight it was also pretty obvious that bran was dreaming about the crow and the bird was trying to lead him somewhere my first impression of that scene was so this bird is trying to show him how to use his powers this kid will become psychic or something i admit that i didnt know just how that was going to unfold until i read the books after watching the rerun i was instantly hooked and read every book in the series but i certainly did not think the reference was too subtle or obscure i think the scene where lady died also helped with this  bran awoke the moment she died which proved he was in some way tied to the direwolves too he thus had an affinity with animals and would soon develop a link with the threeeyed crow once i managed to connect to stark kidsdirewolves i also realised why sansa was so weak i do agree regarding renlyloras though the hints in the first book when i read it were very subtle  but by that time of course i was reading the book in the light of my viewing experience"

"malek",2011-06-01,"no it seemed the same as in the book to me in the previous episode tyrion was saying in front of bronn that my father will offer a handsome reward and a lannister always pays his debts so i think its clear that he had the same plan in the books also up to that point in the book it wasnt clear that his plan all along was to get bronn to champion for him and even tyrion for a moment thought he made a mistake until bronn stepped up i expect in the next episode tyrion will explain to bronn how he knew bronn would champion for him while theyre both in the mountainsi think that tyrions a plan was always to name his brother and see what will happen he probably didnt think that lyssa will neglect his right if he wasnt able to provide his champion right away events turned the way they did tyrion threw the hook and just the fish he needed got caughttyrion had absolutely no reason to believe that bronn would accept his offer any more than he could believe that any other knight of the vale would turn his back to lyssa and champion him for reward he promisedlittle exchange of glances between tyrion and bronn was priceless smokinggif classbbcemoticon altsmoking  almost like tyrion wanted to say you really are greedy arrogant bastard arent you  even if you defeat this guy we will bot probably get killed anyway and like bronn replayed eh i had nothing better to do anyway blushgif classbbcemoticon altblush "

"Kaitscralt",2011-05-22,"great episode my favorite so far really intense and actionpacked the bronn fight was amazing the crowning of viserys was surprisingly sad really well done my only complaint very minor is how mean sansa was to septa mordane firstky she surely knew the answer to those questions if shes been raised by her all her life and secondly the cruelness just felt unnecessary this time i think the roslyn thing was just some more exposition showing that theon has nothing going for him in winterfell and that everyone is leaving the north didnt miss the wolves or jon at all my first 1010 for the poll edited by kaitscralt 22 may 2011  0909 pm"

"House Snow",2011-05-22,"lloyd will definitely be missed he took one of the worst characters in the book and completely reimagined the way i see him i feel like if i picked up the book now because of him i would enjoy the dothraki scenes more than i did the first time around one thing i havent seen talke about much is how much better the tv show is doing of uniting the dothraki westeros storyline that is done in the book where early on they felt way too much like too sepearate books"
"Greywolf2375",2011-05-22," the absence of the direwolves has become way too noticeable they should have been with them in the woods i liked seeing robb kick some ass but still summer should have ripped out the throats of the wildlingsi disagree with that  i knew they should have been there but didnt even think about them not showing up not having them in there is making a more human story than a magical wolf interposing intself dont get me wrong i loved how the wolves and the kids bonded in the books but not having them in the tv series a lot up to this point just gotten used to it"

"House Snow",2011-05-22,"also superimpressed by the kids in this episode those were some pretty hard scenes to pull off for kids and they did an awesome job oh wait i dont care lol"

"LugaJetboyGirl-irra",2011-05-22,"i was wondering if ros was going to be shae glad to hear thats not the case the battle between bron and the knight had some changes but still was pretty goodit makes most sense for ros to replace chataya and her daughter they would be two more characters the audience would have to get used to and that hbo would have to pay since tyrion already knows ros it would make sense for him to go to her brothel as the cover story instead of chatayas edited by lugajetboygirl 22 may 2011  0938 pm"

"Cold Hands-Hot Pie",2011-05-22,"any takes on the robertrenly interaction on the hunt i can see that roberts constant glory days stories would wear thin especially when accompanied by the put downs etc but it seemed like there was some genuine animosity there so the question isdoes hbo robert know about renly and loras i think its pretty clear that book robert doesnthe says to ned that loras is the exact sort of son a man would want after the tourneynot something i think hed say if he knew he was his brothers lover its completely believable that book robert is clueless but hbo robert is presented as a little more aware still a bad king but at least aware of things happening"
"oneeye",2011-05-22,"i thought we proved sf is not jh in some long threads hmm seems roz is going to be the main topic of this week p i like how they gave dany a little fire resistance we have not seen much magic yet the wights brans dream the direwolves dany and fire and maybe the blondnessblack hair running true thing for lannisters and baratheons respectively even gandalf had more magic than this i am sure dany will burn again once the dragons are hatched or if not even better"

"Rockroi",2011-05-22,"ive noticed some scenes like the boar scene or at the dothraki feast where viserys gets crowned where there should be more people in the scenes maybe its the budget constraintsits obviously budget constraints at the same time the point of certain issues is to hide this fact well than why have robert hunt at all the only thing i can think of is that its a sag issue of some sort wherein in order to get a certain pay scale you have to appear in x episodes etc and addys people i have no clue if addy even has any people negotiated for him to be in x episodes when you factor in that he cannot be in x episodes due to well mortality they have to punch him in in other ways so you get a hunting scene a really really lame hunting scene though this does not excuse the lack of the toj that scene would have consisted of 4 actors ned and three guys dont want to cast dayne and hightower just yet easy solution just have them speak with their visors pulled down problem solved ned doesnt even remember the faces of the guys who rode with them make them super blurry i swear it would have been far far more interesting than listening to renly snivel i think renly is the most disappointing portrayal in the seriesabsolutely renly is as bad as addys robert is good i thought as you did that renly was supposed to be this charismatic prettyboy who saw the angles of things and made his play instead we have a watereddown joff in many ways a little kid utterly overwhelmed by the events around him trying to act like he is worth something"

"Social Justice Bass",2011-05-23,"great episode although i think i still liked the previous one more 1 tyrion was the highlight of that episode everything from his interaction with mord to his exit out the door was great my only regret was the absence of two particular lines the line tyrion gives to marillion and tyrions line to lysa tully when she gets upset after the match about the arryn house words 2 little robert arryn was great including his excitement at the moon door being opened and his hilarious reaction to tyrions cutoff story about the donkey and the honeycomb in the brothel 3 showtheon continues to be more interesting and sympathetic than booktheon its going to be rather sad and shocking when he kills bran and rickon driving the sympathy meter down to 50 4 i figured that they would have some sort of scene with joffrey and sansa rekindling things and this one definitely didnt disappoint the actor playing joffrey continues to be absolutely fantastic in the role 5 speaking of actors doing a great job playing psychotic characters goodbye harry lloydasviserys not that im fond of the character but he was definitely entertaining edited by wise bass 23 may 2011  1240 am"

"Corvinus",2011-05-23,"i personally really liked the hunting scene  never really even occurred to me that there should be more people after all hunters wander into groups placesactually there should have been way more people than just those four when you hunt boar at least in the middle ages idk on how its done today you needed teams of men with dogs to root out the boar then you had the guys spotting the boar and blowing the horns and others probably on horses to try to guide the boar towards the actual hunter who waits with the spear i think the hunting scene was just to show how robert keeps drinking and not being very focused on the hunt i dont expect to actually see what happens in the hunt this was just so we know that robert is out boar hunting"
"Lord Godric",2011-05-23,"i personally really liked the hunting scene  never really even occurred to me that there should be more people after all hunters wander into groups i liked renlys speech and it really set the stage for his future movements hes reminding us that theres a human cost to these games and i think he comes across as sincere  hell be beloved by viewers maybe not for his pomp but for his heart which will make his demise all the more tragic it already was for me in the booki liked renly a lot in the book but his death always was unemotional for me because we barely knew him i think they are doing a great service to renlys character by making him a more rounded character edited by lord godric 23 may 2011  1249 am"
"Eponine",2011-05-23,"havent had time to read the whole thread but imo this was by far the best episode the entire eyrie part including last week came together beautifully  my favorite part of the tv show so far i thought that the characters who didnt have major parts in the episode were well integrated this time nitpicks im sad to see sansa being a brat instead of protecting herself by being coldly courteous and again some of the scenes are oddly sparse i understand that there are probably good budgetary reasons but imo the dothraki scenes dont convey the sense that were seeing one small part of a much larger feast and its kind of odd seeing robert renly who is still awful awful awful lancel and ser barriston tramping around the woods by themselves wish we could have seen beric ride in the tourney or something before this i still love robert think hes really stolen the show  i didnt really think much about him in the book  he did have a personality but seemed more like a foil for ned the first time and then on any rereads well theres no point in getting too attached i wonder how people who havent read the books are reacting to ned by this point i think the show made it appear that theres some personal vendetta thats not honor in his sentence against gregor especially with adding the bit about tywin having to answer for him i didnt get that impression from the book but it makes sense however it makes him seem less like someone whose honor is his downfall"

"Lone",2011-05-23,"renly is a completely different character in the show this has been covered littlefinger seems tactless almost out of control which is a big failure for the show in my opinion needlessly straying from the book is starting to annoy me more with each episode and yeah the hunting scene was not believable no way robert would walk at any point until they actually found something to kill another thing that bothered me was bronns opponent i dont think he wouldve taken that chance with a knight of his own age or younger as it appeared they didnt need to make lysas champion so young why change that from how it was in the book it makes bronn seem reckless whereas his decisionmaking is almost mathematical in reality the mistake i think the show is making is that they are changing things for the sole purpose of creating conflict and trading slowbuilding pressure for cheap immediate thrills they seem to have no problem messing with major characters for little reason the books have more than enough going on to keep us interested so the changes just come across as illconceived the subtlety and depth of characters and plots is being lost and replaced with an emotional angsty shallowness blarg edited by lone 23 may 2011  0133 am"

"Ghost of Crackclaw",2011-05-23,"im actually arguing from both book and tv but mostly from the tv perspective your example of nymeria is perfect when do we ever see nymeria in the books we hear stories of a giant wolfpack roaming the riverlands but we never see it has the wolfpack had a major impact on any storylines robb can just as easily be called young wolf because he is old wolfs son i dont see how grey wind is critical to robbs domination at allill agree with most that the wolves tie into the characters of the stark children but i never felt is was critical to the story of course we dont know what will happen in the next 3 booksit is actually viserys words that come back here grey wind gives robb the element of fear that would otherwise be lacking he is able to trade to some degree on the love his bannerman held for his father but the greatjon scene shows that only went so far leaving out the wolves is far from a clean lift unless you then go on and alter the fundamental story i dont mean changing pov scenes to show characters doing things that werent in the booksi mean altering the word of grrm all in all this is the hobbits and the ents all over again it may have worked onscreen but its both wrong and contrary to the betterment of the story to the greater part of the fanbase that is fueling this thing in the first place which is to say its not really all that important for a tv audience but its still wrong winkgif classbbcemoticon alt "

"Blue Steel",2011-05-17,"the way i see it this is the first of two chances they will have to show the tower of joy flashback the other being when ned hallucinates in the dungeons i really hope it makes it in some form the entire scene reads like a movie script as it is with the dialogue going back and forth between ned and the kingsguarddayne pulling out dawn and sayingso now it begins and then ned sadly unsheathing his blade and calmly replyingno now it ends with blue rose petals blowing in the background and lyanna crying out in pain this scene could really be epicthat scene is so epic it also establishes a romanticism for the kingguardour knees do not bend easily said ser arthur dayneser willem darry is fled to dragonstone with your queen and prince viserys i thought you might have sailed with himser willem is a good man and true said ser oswellbut not of the kingsguard ser gerold pointed out the kingsguard does not fleethen or now said ser arthur he donned his helmwe swore a vow explained old ser geroldi love that passage and i love how each of the kingsguard seem to be finishing eachothers lines and then you have lyanna screaming in the background and then promise me ned i would love to see that it probably wont be in episode 6 because that scene is all about romanticism and ran has already said that he felt the series lacked a lot of the romanticism of the novel it could conceiveably work better when ned is having his dreams in the dungeon later on as you have pointed out so heres hoping edited by greatness 17 may 2011  0309 pm"

"Civfan",2011-05-21,"no flashbacks dont work in movies as well as books unless theyre from the pointofview of a present character who is alive how would they transition to it otherwise no if they dont have a ned flashback for the tower of joy then it would have to be from the only other survivor howland reed and hes not introduced yetwell the example i gave was the warlock house they could easily start an episode as a flashback they do that on supernatural a lot and it works well tonights episode for example it fades in like a normal episode but as soon as you see ned youd know this isnt happening in the present show itd have to work with the plot at the time but i think that would work flash backs arent always a character remembering something"
"Anomandaris86",2011-05-21,"oh parallel timelines are what you are talking about as in one plot in the past and one in the present and it jumps back and forth between the two or not in any case those things work because they both keep getting continuously developed if its just a oneoff flashback it needs to bewell a flashback otherwise its just floating out there in the show with no connection to anything else"
"Hyper",2011-05-21,"i love the hbo series but if the toj scene is cut the series might as well be for naught it doesnt have to be this week but it does need to showngeez for the love of get real what is the deal with this bizarro fascination with a feverish dreamflashback passage from ned in the book it is not that important and it cannot be trusted either due to neds state of mind it is a dream not even a proper flashbackthis has just gotten absurd it is a poetic passage that may offer some clues but it is certainly not the most important scenepassage in the book"
"Anomandaris86",2011-05-21,"it gives a lot of hints about things in the past  in fact without it no one could infer rlj and if that theory turns out to be true then it is definitely a very important scene and its important for other reasons as well as i laid out in another post so no its not something inconsequential that can be lightly brushed aside by the producers its a very important scene for the book neds character and the series as a whole"
"Ran",2011-05-21,"its thematically important but its not really a lynchpin the red wedding thats a lynchpin sequence that must be shown i love the tower of joy ive already explained my own reasons for why i think the show needs something like it but part of adaptation means making choices that would include reducing or entirely removing certain themes to focus on fewer themes in more detailso far the show has largely dropped the romanticization of the past and romanticism in general"
"Anomandaris86",2011-05-21,"if they can show viserys and doreah in the bathtub than they can definitely show the tower of joy if they dont thats indicative of massively skewed priorities"
"End of Disc One",2011-05-21,"im slowly growing to hate the toj scene just because of its fans"
"Morrigan",2011-05-21,"geez for the love of get real what is the deal with this bizarro fascination with a feverish dreamflashback passage from ned in the book it is not that important and it cannot be trusted either due to neds state of mind it is a dream not even a proper flashbackthis has just gotten absurd it is a poetic passage that may offer some clues but it is certainly not the most important scenepassage in the booksome clues dude its the single biggest clue to rlj without it the theory has no merit and if rlj isnt true the scene is pretty much pointless unless it hides an even bigger and deeper meaning and when does grrm ever write any pointless dream sequences think about it three kingsguards the most badass ones too guarding a tower where lyanna is and ned purposefully lists all the other places where the kingsguard should be with their king with their kings heir with the pregnant queen and they all say no this is here that were meant to be how can that not be majorly significant to the storyif they remove it from season 1 theyll have to replace it with some other scene altogether since you need ned to remember it and i doubt they can come up with something better the only acceptable possibility imo is if daenerys witnesses the scene herself in the house of the undying ones in season 2if they can show viserys and doreah in the bathtub than they can definitely show the tower of joy if they dont thats indicative of massively skewed prioritiesthis edited by morrigan 21 may 2011  0148 pm"
"MikeNH",2011-05-21,"some clues dude its the single biggest clue to rlj without it the theory has no meritif they remove it from season 1 theyll have to replace it with some other scene altogether since you need ned to remember itits the single biggest clue in the book and yes we dont even know if its true that doesnt mean they cant think of some other way to hint at rlj grrm is invovled in the show afterall he may have already worked on that with themand as for only ned can tell it  that is also easily changed we dont know for sure that ned never talked about what went down there with someone and even if he didnt in the books he certainly could have in the show there is still reed and they could easily change it so that there was another survivorso far in the books that scene has only hinted at the rlj theory  it hasnt served any other purpose so its pretty easy to write around that for the show"
"Huan",2011-05-21,"i read somewhere probably in a review of the show that when grrm met with dd to discuss making the series he asked them about jons parentage and was happy with their response i assume that means they know who jons parents are maybe they dont feel the need to delve into jons background this early in the series at least not in season one when they werent sure they would have a second season"
"Jaime Lannister",2011-05-22,"im slowly growing to hate the toj scene just because of its fansi feel you there its an amazing scene in the book and no one loves it more than i do but damn its not the end of the world if it gets cut in fact i dont think it works very well on tv this season i would prefer a retelling in a later season by the only man left alive that witnessed it"
"Carldog",2011-05-22,"henry l has done a great job the best portrayal so far i think i would have loved to see a little more of him as v but the story moves on well done hl"

"walrus",2011-05-23,"so about this whole toj debate check out this quote from harry lloyd viserysi remember them saying at the beginning there were going to be no dreams no flashbacks but we have seen a couple of brans dreams so i dont knowso if they the creators said at one point there were no dreams or flashbacks id say it is very unlikely that there will be a toj scene even if they did end up including the crow dreams quote is from this interview"
