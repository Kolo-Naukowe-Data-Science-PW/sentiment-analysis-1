1	Ran	2014-04-06	Have at it!
2	Warhawk137	2014-04-06	Seven.
Â 
Eeeh, it's the season premier episode.Â  Those are never really any great shakes.
Â 
Did a fine job establishing most of the major plotlines of the season, though, and that's really all you can ask.
3	Wmarshal	2014-04-06	That was so f*cking awesome. Just when I was going to quiet the show.
4	Cas Stark	2014-04-06	I loved it. Â Not sure about bringing the "Mercy" stuff up this early, but otherwise, it was great. Â
5	Trebla	2014-04-06	9/10. Best premiere of any season
6	John Hulboy	2014-04-06	Episode was great with arts getting a little revenge and retrieving Needle.looking forward to rest of season.
7	Joyful Union	2014-04-06	Great ep. 9/10
8	Mark Antony	2014-04-06	8.5 so I voted 9
9	Montey14	2014-04-06	agreed about arias Mercy line.....but I guess it fit being that Polliver is in for the sweetling
10	Montey14	2014-04-06	So I guess now Brienne will be sent to find Aria instead of Sansa.....or will she search for her after Jeoffry's wedding
11	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-04-06	Loved it.Â
12	Daena the Defiant	2014-04-06	Wait so the wedding is next episode already? Wowsers
13	Dany's Silver	2014-04-06	9/10
Â 
I thoroughly enjoyed this episode (and that's not just the vino talking).Â  I will enjoy it even more when I rewatch it, and I am definitely happy to have this show back on the air.
14	Zman1863	2014-04-06	It was ok. A bit slow throughout most but that was pretty much expected. Curious about how they are going to frame Arya's arc this season since they moved up one of the biggest scenes. Wasn't too much of the stuff they did with Jaime due to his arriving in KL early.Â
15	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-06	2/10 I hated those Thenn.
16	Liddle	2014-04-06	Very good premiere, best since the first season. Oberyn Martell's introduction was a little over the top, but his discussion with Tyrion was excellent. I really liked Arya's scene at the end; it was definitely a better adaptation than I expected, given the Tickler's death in season two. Jon's scene was OK. Sansa+Dontos was a bit rushed, but at least they're setting up for the future. Jaime's scenes were pretty good, and I liked what little we had of Brienne. There are a couple of weak-ish points to the episode. The reforging of Ice was done with little fanfare, but the series hasn't made much of the importance of those ancestral weapons. The introduction of the Thenns felt a little clunky. Daenerys was just kind of there, and so was Tyrion, I felt, but I know not everybody can have action every episode -- things take some setting up.
17	Darth Pipes	2014-04-06	9/10.Â  Great job.Â  And I wasn't annoyed by much.Â  Always a good thing.
18	Atroksia	2014-04-06	I am so happy and thrilled that GoT finally continues. The translation from the book into the series was partly not as expexted, but still great. Happy I am.
19	MoIaF	2014-04-06	8/10 - not bad, not bad at all.
20	tito5601	2014-04-06	8/10 great intro with tywin throwing the pelt into the fire also i must say those thenns are really scary
21	Warhawk137	2014-04-06	2/10 I hated those Thenn.


Â 
That gets it a 2/10?
22	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2014-04-06	I'd normally give it a 7, but I have to bump it up to an 8 for the sword of the morning name drop!
23	Lord Godric	2014-04-06	I'd give it an solid 8.Â  A really good episode overall, I really loved the opening with Twin but some of the changes (ugh such a purist) I didn't like, particularly Tyrion's welcoming of Oberyn.
24	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-06	Â 
That gets it a 2/10?plus the lack of magic with Neds sword as if it doesnt want to be splited, the still "Ewing Dallas" view of the Lannister family, the Noyed Allister Thorne which neglets further book cool scenes, and the awful way they are doing the Shae story.....etc.
25	The Shadow Wolf	2014-04-06	Had to give it a ten just for the ending alone. Loved Arya sticking it to Polliver. 
Almost felt like a Dany ending with the GoT theme in the background and Arya riding away on her white horse.
26	KalibakCruel	2014-04-06	9/10 As far as openers go, this is my favorite since the season 1's. Loved Aryas scene, liked all of Jaime's scenes, and Oberyn is looking good already.
27	Widows_Blood	2014-04-06	I gave it a ten because I am high on joy right now. Honestly, i'd give it a 9. Thenn introduction was great. Kit Harington was great. Red Viper intro was spot on. Arya and the hound was icing on the cake. I also loved the shot of the destroyed countryside at the end. One quibble I have had with this show is that they have sort of neglected how the war has impacted the small folk so I am very glad that we will get a look into that though Arya and the hound.Â
28	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-06	Thought it was the best season opener since season 1. Especially the last part.
29	Batavian	2014-04-06	10 out of 10.
Â 
Fantastic casting of Pedro Pascal as the Red Viper. Really looking forward to following Oberynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s storyline in the series.
Â 
Looks like the CG has improved too with the increase in popularity of the series. Drogon is the coolest dragon since the stop-motion Vermithrax of DragonSlayer. Refreshing after the hugely disappointing portrayal of Smaug in that other epic fantasy.
Â 
It will be interesting see how well Michiel Huisman does. I think the Daario recast will be more significant than the other major recast in season 4.
30	Died a Hero	2014-04-06	9
Â 
Loved the open. Tywin putting the wolf pelt in the flame was a great touch. The Red Viper was very Red Viper. I know the prudes on the board will piss and moan, but Oberyn's track is one of sex and blood. Get used to it. Poor Sansa. Marge and gandma kickass picked up right where they left off. Shea the Funny Whore was meh. But she's always meh. LOVED the Thenn. My little brother was freaked the fucked out when he saw them. I didn't mind the Ayra change up on the time line. It'll hurry the bond between her and the Hound so TV onrly folks see what the payoff is on episode 9. All and all, good stuff. Great to have our baby back.
Â 
Edit: Oh, the pointing child! NVM. That made this a 10! I can't believe they didn't cut it out. Sure, it wasn't an infant, but good enough.

31	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-06	I'd say 8.5.
Â 
Â  Love seeing Aemon back. I enjoyed Bronn and Sandor's lines. I think Oberyn's introduction was perhaps laid on a bit thick, but I think he plays the part well. Shae is getting pretty jealous....we know what that means.....
Â
32	Baitac	2014-04-06	9/10 but only because my heart wasn't crazy racing like it has for other episodes (Blackwater and Red Wedding). I'm so happy this is back. I thought the dragons scene was well done. Kit is acting all grown up as he should. Fantastic!
33	karna1983	2014-04-06	I loved it. Â Not sure about bringing the "Mercy" stuff up this early, but otherwise, it was great.

What was that, think i missed it.
34	Jslay427	2014-04-06	Didn't really like the Brienne and Jamie exchange about Sansa. Hard to do anything else due to the PW having taken place in the books before Jamie gets to KL. Wanted him to be like, I will keep this vow and save her. Still a 9/10
35	Jabronius Maximus	2014-04-06	I'd give an 8.5, but I just rounded up to a 9. I thought it was great aside from Dany's scenes. I'm not a fan of book Dany so there's some obvious bias, but I just thought her scenes were lacking.
36	Howling Mad	2014-04-06	Oberyn Martell's introduction was one of the best of the series. Well done.
37	KalibakCruel	2014-04-06	Oh I'd like to add in that Kit's acting in this episode, in the little he was in, is miles better than he's been all series long lol. Maybe it was just me, but I actually BELIEVED his acting today. Especially when he talked about eating with the wildlings. Also, liked the Thenns.
38	Warhawk137	2014-04-06	Oh I'd like to add in that Kit's acting in this episode, in the little he was in, is miles better than he's been all series long lol. Maybe it was just me, but I actually BELIEVED his acting today. Especially when he talked about eating with the wildlings. Also, liked the Thenns.


Â 
Frankly, I was liking where he was going with the character toward the end of the season last year.Â  Particularly his bit to Ygritte about how they can't win.
Â 
Maybe it's just his interpretation of the way the character grows.
39	Widows_Blood	2014-04-06	Oh I'd like to add in that Kit's acting in this episode, in the little he was in, is miles better than he's been all series long lol. Maybe it was just me, but I actually BELIEVED his acting today. Especially when he talked about eating with the wildlings. Also, liked the Thenns.


He was great in season one and had great moments in season 3, especially GRRM's episode. Like Emilia Clarke, their acting suffers when the writing suffers. When Kit is given good lines, like this episode, he really shines. I thought he was wonderful. Sounded like he's really grown up. Put that punk ass Slynt back in his place. Can't wait for "Edd fetch me a block".
40	karna1983	2014-04-06	Loved the hound.
Thenn were scary, reminded me of hellraiser. Were they cannibals in the book?
Oberyn was great and he is great for the role.
41	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-06	7.5. The .5 comes from Arya being a badass and the Duncan the Tall nod and blue rose in my dome.Â 
Â 
Yes. Very yes.Â
42	Jslay427	2014-04-06	The Thenns in book were not said to be cannibal. Only the clans from Skagos IIRC.
43	Ran	2014-04-06	The ice river clans are said to be cannibals. But no, the Thenns aren't. They basically just squished them and the savage cannibal clans together.
44	Urrax2	2014-04-06	...I hated those Thenn.


  I gave it only a 5. Â
45	John Hulboy	2014-04-06	Episode was great with arts getting a little revenge and retrieving Needle.looking forward to rest of season.10
46	KalibakCruel	2014-04-06	He was great in season one and had great moments in season 3, especially GRRM's episode. Like Emilia Clarke, their acting suffers when the writing suffers.

Â I should rephrase. I made it sound like I didn't like Kit before. Actually I've always liked him even when people thought he was too dull. But his scene today for me was just surprising. He has a new confidence to him.
47	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-06	The Tenns are supposed to be the wilding group more similar to the northeners, with Lords, ranks and bronce armors.  There was no need to call this Tenn. If D&D want to change stuff bring up names of their own.
					
					
							Edited by SeA±or de la Tormenta, 06 April 2014 - 09:56 PM.
48	Robin Of House Hill	2014-04-06	8. Â It was good for setting up the rest of the season.

Hes not just so emo, he now has a strong personality.
50	nhebron	2014-04-06	I thought it was a good set up for the rest of the seasons...but wasn't overly impressed. Â I rated it a 7.
51	modbelle	2014-04-06	9/10. Based highly on Oberyn stabbing random Lannister supporter. The badass of his performance and unpredictability got me. Plus, I know the episode is good when it feels like a half hour rather than an hour.
52	KalibakCruel	2014-04-06	Hes not just so emo, he now has a strong personality.


Yeah that's a perfect way to put it. He's not sulking anymore. Can't wait to see how he does in the rest of the season.
Â 
Also, not a fan of new Naharis. Not as arrogant as Skrein.
53	dtones520	2014-04-06	I thought the whole episode was strong outside of the Tyrion/Shae scene, but that's just more with me not liking how they have portrayed their "romance" but I never really understood it in the books either. Another tiny annoyance was that they spelled "Ser" as "Sir" in the white book. Show watchers had no idea, and I'm willing to be the art designer who made it didn't either, but as a book fan I cringed for a split second. No big deal, just a petty complaint.
I loved the entire introduction of the Dornish and Prince Oberyn, painted his character points perfectly for non readers as a lustful, vengeful, dangerous man who will do whatever he wants when he wants. His monologue about Elia was pure gold. Only wish they mentioned Rhaenys and Aegons names in it, but I get not wanting to muddy the water with more and more names all at once. Love the casting of Ellaria too, actress is gorgeous.
Jon's scene was great, like the new Daario, brought Dontos back into the fold and he gave Sansa her purple jewels, loved Aryas revenge, the Hound had me in stitches, the Thenns were badass...
Everything was great, still not 10/10 great, but a solid 9.
54	King Kev.	2014-04-06	Very solid. 9.
Â 
Good set up for future events that will take place in the later episodes, and some genuinely amazing scenes. Oberyn was fantastic, and I loved it when he stabbed that guy. The final scene was brilliant as well, it took its sweet time ratcheting up the tension and it paid off, I almost started laughing ecstatically during that fight. Excellent.

I was laughing ecstatically at the Hounds one liners. "Only Cunts" ROFL.
56	ohpooratlas	2014-04-06	I gave it a 7 but I'm admittedly a very hard grader.
Â 
It was by far the best premier since the first season. Loved Oberyn's introduction. Loved the Arya/Hound scene. Loved the dragons ... especially loved Drogon snapping at Dany ... I jumped just like she did. Loved (and hated all at the same time) the breaking down of ice.
Â 
Loved Jon Snow's scene too and I agree that Kit did a fantastic job with it.
Â 
I also loved Margaery's sarcastic comment about Joffrey choosing a string of dead sparrows for her necklace, and how the QoT immediately put her in her place and was like "hush your tongue dear, even with me."
57	Fez	2014-04-06	9/10
Â 
That's partly because I'm just so excited that the show's back, but I also think the episode did a really good job of catching non-readers up with a lot of backstory and setting up most of the major plotlines of the season.
58	The Great Unwashed	2014-04-06	I gave the episode a 7/10.  Unfortunately, the scenes with Jaime I felt were rather lacking, since they're having to invent scenes for him since they sped up his arrival.  Oberyn seems like he will be interesting, but I felt the scene between him and Tyrion lacked much of the elegance and tension of their first meeting in the novel.
I felt Jon's scenes were good although I would have liked to see more of his reaction to the news regarding Robb.  Kit Harington really seems to be more comfortable as Jon.  Dany's scenes were meh, although I think the new actor playing Daario is a better pick...although my better half was less than pleased.  The scene with Tyrion and Sansa was very good I felt.
59	Montey14	2014-04-06	Although the books only hint and vaguely mention that Red Viper lies with boys....he is openly bi-sexual in the series.....
60	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-06	Ah, also I love Maester Aemon

"How can you tell a liar?"

62	Mark Antony	2014-04-06	the 2 swords though.....we know Brienne has one blade.....but what happens to the blade that was given to Geoffrey.Â Â  Was he buried with it .....GRRM never elaborates in the books....


I think it goes to Tommen?

Â 
As per the wiki, Tommen has it.
64	Ser Creighton	2014-04-06	The ice river clans are said to be cannibals. But no, the Thenns aren't. They basically just squished them and the savage cannibal clans together.

Sort of feeling bad for a certain Karstark right about now.
65	Sand11751	2014-04-06	8/10; some things felt a bit disjointed with the wildlings and Thenn, but the best parts were Oberyn's intro and Jon before the NW. Missing Maester Aemon.Â
66	The Monkey	2014-04-06	I loved it all. The Arya/Hound scene was obviously the highpoint, but all the scenes were good, especially the Oberyn ones. Also gotta agree with ya'll, Kit gave a real solid performance here, it bodes well for the rest of the season.Â 
Â 
Do you think they will ever explain why Allister Thorne returned in the show, without ever having visited KL in the show?
67	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-06	Sort of feeling bad for a certain Karstark right about now.


This one?Â http://img4.wikia.no...dKarstarkS3.jpg
68	Florent Vixen	2014-04-06	8 leaning towards a 9. Liked Oberyn, Arya and the Hound best.
Opening scene was good.
69	Ser Creighton	2014-04-06	Changed a lot from the books, a little over the top, I give it a 7, though I know Jaime is not acting like he should from the books. But I can see where it is going with his character, it seems to make sense.
Pro's 
Arthur Dayne
Dunk
Flower power
Dragons
New Darrio, better than old Darrio
Production values
Wolf pelt on the fire
Joff touching the White book, so wrong but so perfect, he won the war and Broke Stannis, I was waiting for him to write his own name in the book.
Dead child,
Cons
Brie and Marg WTF, oh high it's great to meet you nothing odd here.
Nothing like Grey Tyrion, oh wait that's the books
Over the top Oberyn not to bad, but a little pushy skipped the Tyrion story would have liked that.
Arya, felt a little early for that jump in brutality, at least for me.
The necklace from Ser Dontos
Nothing really bad for me except the Brie and the Tyrell moment, just some things that felt a bit out of place. Nothing really spectacular, Dragons looked good some nice book drops, had a nice feel to it. Liked Dontos a lot more than I thought I would. It was good, with some very good moments, not sure what else to say
70	Ser Maneth Grossart	2014-04-06	The Tenns are supposed to be the wilding group more similar to the northeners, with Lords, ranks and bronce armors. There was no need to call this Tenn. If D&D want to change stuff bring up names of their own.

I think we understood. No need to over do it with the explanation. Thank you.
71	Ser Creighton	2014-04-06	This one?Â http://img4.wikia.no...dKarstarkS3.jpg

Nope, another far more liked Karstark.
72	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-06	Are we sure the Thenns are cannibals or they were simply messing up with the group because they used to have a baby crow with them?
73	Corvinus	2014-04-06	9.5/10 Liked everything except the blue rose. Only one woman should have that, and her name is not Daenerys Targaryen.Â
74	BrettStark	2014-04-06	Loved the episode, I wish people didn't always compare the show to the books. Saying "why didn't this or that happen" ...I've read all the books & I LOVE the show JUST as much. People need to start viewing the show as its own entity. Personally I even wish sometimes that the show would skew even more from the books. If everything was exactly the same it wouldn't be as enjoyable to me because I'd already know what has happened.
Â 
Great episode, I loved Oberyn.Â
75	KalibakCruel	2014-04-06	Am I the only one so far that DOESN'T like new Daario? I see people saying they like him. I really don't so far. I know it's early, but he's not arrogant enough, and he's missing that edge, that cocky swagger, the smirk, the walk. I don't know. I just don't know.
76	Er Rn	2014-04-06	8/10.
Loved Arya, Margaery, Jon, Oberyn, Bronn.
The Thenn cannibal stuff was a little over the top.
77	Cas Stark	2014-04-06	Am I the only one so far that DOESN'T like new Daario? I see people saying they like him. I really don't so far. I know it's early, but he's not arrogant enough, and he's missing that edge, that cocky swagger, the smirk, the walk. I don't know. I just don't know.


Â 
I didn't like him, too bland. Â He's not enough of an upgrade that I see for a recasting.
78	Addam Velaryon	2014-04-06	I'm a little shocked at everyone's nonchalance of the Dragon FX ... they were absolutely beautiful. Are we really THIS jaded?

8.5 for the show, and a full extra point to the Hound for being HBOs new Omar Little.Â  
I was wowwed by Oberyn, and stunned by the new Jon.Â  I guess he's finished reeling over the loss of his father and siblings, and becoming his father's son, bastard or no.Â  The dragons looked awesome, and I will wait until further episodes to decide whether or not I like the new Dany/Daario relationship.Â  O.o
Am I the only one who choked up a little bit when Tywin handed Ice over to the blacksmith?Â Â  :sniffle:

Â 
Best intro episode of the series. The Red Viper was all I was hoping for and more. Arya and the Hound were incredible. Rory McCann knocked it out of the park.
81	Mr Hodor	2014-04-06	Tywin is getting scarier by the second.Â 
Â 
Loved Oberyn and Mercy, great that they brought Dontos back.Â 
Â 
Did not like the cannibal Thenns, i so not remember them being cannibals (please correct me if i am wrong)
82	Queen of Whores	2014-04-06	A very solid 7 out of 10. The best premiere since season 1, but I guess that's not saying much, since the other two were very average.
Â 
The good
Â 
- The Arthur Dayne and Duncan the Tall namedrops were so awesome. Easily my favourite things of the episode.
- Some of the Hound's lines were hilarious, like "what the fuck is a Lommy," "those people are cunts," and "I don't care if heÂ ateÂ your friend!"
- Cool to see the Dreadfort and Meereen in the intro.
- I may have had to suppress a little fanboy giggle when Doran and Sunspear were namedropped.
- The CGI at the end, of that whole war-torn landscape, was pretty amazing.
- Even though it was kind of random and short, I really liked the Sansa/Dontos scene. It was cool to have him hint at the history of House Hollard. And finally Sansa is getting back to her old, not-that-dumb self.
Â 
The meh
Â 
- Oberyn's introduction. The entire scene in the brothel was completely pointless and served no purpose. I also didn't like Oberyn brutally attacking that Lannister guy. Sure he was a dick, but c'mon. We will see Oberyn's a badass later.
- The Margaery/Brienne scene was completely pointless, since Margaery already doubted Brienne killed Renly, when Loras convinced her.
- Emilia continues to be an actress with zero range of tone and expression, and it made her scenes very dull.
- The Jaime/Tywin confrontation was a bit underwhelming compared to how I thought it would be.
Â 
The bad
Â 
- Olenna Tyrell is seriously getting very annoying and unfunny at this point. She is coming across less witty and more bitchy every episode.
Â 
When that's the only thing that's not that good about an episode though, I'm generally pretty happy. A really good premiere, and hopefully the season continues with this quality.

83	4th Dragon Head	2014-04-06	7/10
Â 
Only bc I hold this show to a higher standard. Compared to most other TV shows, every GoT episode getsÂ  10/10, but compared to other episodes of this show, this gets a 7.
Â 
I understand that they wanted to go ahead and give us more context for Oberyn and how he is, but his intro compared to the book intro was not nearly as good. The banter between him and Tyrion while riding into KL was one of my favorite moments from the book, and I am a little disappointed that we didn't get to see that play out on the screen. But like I said, I get it. He will only be in 7 or 8 episodes so they had to hurry up and explain his character to non readers.
Â 
I wasn't crazy about the Jamie scenes either. Its going to be interesting having him there for what is about to happen.
Â 
Other than that, it was good. Great to finally be back in Westeros, even if its only for 9 more weeks.
84	4th Dragon Head	2014-04-06	What do you mean by her old, not-that-dumb self? She was dumb at the start, and over the course of the four books she finally becomes less dumb and naAve.

Jaime's hair wasn't short in the books.
86	Queen of Whores	2014-04-06	What do you mean by her old, not-that-dumb self? She was dumb at the start, and over the course of the four books she finally becomes less dumb and naAve.


Â 
I'm trying not to compare her (or most things now) to the books (cause I'm a couple of inches away from being a purist) but in season 2 Sansa actually carried an air of intelligence and dignity and maturity to her, then in season 3 that dropped right back down to not at all, with several stupid moments like asking if her family could come to the wedding and being far too happy in her marriage to Tyrion. From the premiere it looks like Sansa is getting back on the right track, so to speak.
87	greywindsrage	2014-04-06	8/10. Well done for a first episode. Jaimes scenes were great. Loved Team Stark and Clegane at the end.
88	Words of Winter	2014-04-06	I gave it an 8.Â  It was solid.Â  I did not like the Thenns.Â  It will make an awkward situation if they follow the book.Â  The Thenns were not cannibals, but I don't think it is absolutely necessary that a Thenn follows through with what is in the books.
Â 
I think the Arya scene was about as good as they could do because it reintroduces the 2nd sword Stark named sword.Â  Of course the first is now two Lannister swords.
89	DogLover	2014-04-06	7/10, which is better than I was expecting for a season premiere. Very action packed and the immediate introduction of Oberyn Martell made me swoon. I thought Kit was amazing and I loved the scene. I did not like the portrayal of the Thenns, however.  I'm also annoyed with the screwing of the timeline. I thought Sandor's fight at the inn would happen toward the end of the season. Nor am I down with Brienne's interaction with the Tyrells or Sansa's meeting with Dontos.

- Oberyn's introduction. The entire scene in the brothel was completely pointless and served no purpose. I also didn't like Oberyn brutally attacking that Lannister guy. Sure he was a dick, but c'mon. We will see Oberyn's a badass

Pointless?
Here's what the pointless brothel scene accomplished:
1. Intro to the red viper and Ellaria and their unique relationship
2. Showed oberyn's voracious sexual appetites. 
3. Showed oberyn's hair trigger temper and loathing for lannisters
4. Showed oberyn's fighting prowess
But yeah other than that it was pointless and a disgraceful mangling of the holy source material.
92	raj34	2014-04-06	In the books he was also bald for a time. This isn't the books.

Ok I give it a negative infinity cuz he was bald in the books and not a sporting a trendy cropped look.

Aye, I loved that scene. Oberyn's sexual preferencesÂ are a significant part of his character, and they did a good job making it clear what he's like right off the bat when you can't have the third-person descriptions of him.
Â 
I'll watch it again but for now I'm thinking 8/10. Really enjoyed everything about the introduction to Oberyn, Arya/Sandor was fantastic, and IÂ loved the opening scene with Tywin. That scene with Tywin almost single-handedly makes it at least an 8 no matter what the rest of the episode was.

Did not like the cannibal Thenns, i so not remember them being cannibals (please correct me if i am wrong)

You are correct they are not cannibals, poor Alys.
95	shiola	2014-04-06	Hard for me to rate without a re-watch, but my initial thoughts...
Â 
GOOD:
- No dialogue in the opening scene
- Kit's acting
- Cersei being more insane; Cersei's heavier drinking being referenced
- Sassy Aemon. Â Sassy Jon.
- The Hound. Â Everything about The Hound. Â All the time.Â 
- Maisie. Â Everything about Maisie. Â All the time.
- The Dreadfort looking badass in the opening credits.
- Oberyn being intimidating as fuck.
- Shout outs in the Kingsguard
Â 
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT:
- Olenna's fangirling over Brienne
- Something about either the pacing or scene transitions or the way scenes were spread throughout the episode... Â Something felt a bit off. Â A re-watch will improve this.
- The hairnet becoming a necklace. Â How can she subtly lose a gem off of the necklace and not notice it during the wedding? Â The hairnet was really sneaky. Â The necklace is more obvious. Â But, I suppose that's the point for TV. Â Plus, no one on the show ever wears hairnets. Â A necklace is more what we're used to seeing. Â 
- I'm undecided as to whether I like Arya's overkill in the book's inn scene or Arya's slow, calculating, cold killing on the TV inn scene. Â "How many how many how many??" stuck with me and it was really powerful. Â But on the other hand, we got an overkill scene of her with the Frey last finale. Â Plus, the slow killing shows a lot of insight into how she's changing.
- I'm happy Brienne was in the premier, but I didn't like any of her scenes.
- I'm glad they're continuing to set up Shae. Â Coming off of a rewatch of seasons 2 and 3 though, she's like a broken record. Â She says the same paranoid shit over and over again. Â Had I not just seen those seasons, I know I'd be less bothered.
Â 
BAD:
- The slow reveal that the Thenns were cannibals. Â By the time they panned down to the arm, I thought the ominous tone was kind of overdone to the point it was almost silly. Â Other than that, the Thenns were pretty good. Â This is a really stupid complaint, I know.
- New Daario. Â Old Daario delivered his lines in such an over the top kind of poetic way but it seemed natural and he was on the right side of the sexy vs. sleazy line. Â Altogether I thought Old Daario captured what mattered about Book Daario. Â New Daario has no charisma.
- Tywin vs. Jaime. Â I thought the book dialogue was better and they could have borrowed more from it. Â The scene felt rushed. Â 
- Jaime's haircut.
Â 
I'm thinking it felt like a 7/10 for me.. Â But a re-watch would definitely put it higher so I'll just vote 8.

What's with the sarcasm? I directly said I'm not comparing anything to the books, and not a single one of my criticisms were about comparing the show to the books. Did you even read all of my post? Your first two points could have easily been accomplished by having Tyrion and Oberyn talk more, just like how the in the book that one scene completely defined Oberyn's character. He could have easily made a couple of sly references to Ellaria and their ambiguous sexual nature. Your third point can also be done in conversation, and he already clearly showed heavy dislike for the Lannisters in his short convo with Tyrion in the episode. And the fourth point... how is suddenly stabbing a guy in the hand fighting prowess?

Â 


Â 
EXACTLY. Old Daario didn't LOOK like book Daario, but he was arrogant, over the top. He was natural. He had a swagger in his walk, his smirk was perfect. This new Daario, in his limited time seems odd, with little charisma, and no arrogance in his voice or his face.
100	go joff go	2014-04-06	Am I the only one so far that DOESN'T like new Daario? I see people saying they like him. I really don't so far. I know it's early, but he's not arrogant enough, and he's missing that edge, that cocky swagger, the smirk, the walk. I don't know. I just don't know.


I can't speak everyone, but personally want them to get rid of arrogant daario or at least make him successfully suave. Â Daario was hands down the worst character in the book, so making him like the book would be a mistake
101	rohit39	2014-04-06	Anyone else feel that Arya's murder of Tickler would have been more powerful on screen? The almost psychotic interrogation while stabbing him. I can really imagine Maisie Williams doing a great job of that. Not that the Polliver scene was bad, but it was underwhelming.
Â 
And secondly, what the hell! I preferred season 3 Daario! And that's saying a lot. There's absolutely no charm with this new guy.Â

Â 
The Dornish introduction was okay; some might argue that they tried too hard to show Oberyn's promiscuity and hatred for the Lannisters early on, but I was honestly expecting much worse. Pedro Pascal's performance wasn't as overly flamboyant as I had anticipated, which is a good thing.
Â 
I'm fed up of Dany and Daario already and can see the whole Meereen storyline being a complete bore. New Daario is definitely an improvement over the last, but the way they've homogenized his appearance still ruins the character for me.
Â 
The Dontos/Sansa scene was a very nice surprise. I wasn't expecting them to take his character any further than the name day celebration.
Â 
The tavern brawl was entertaining, though I found Arya's re-enactment of Lommy's murder a little bit corny.

I was surprised they recast Daario. The guy is probably my least favorite character in the entire series, but I thought Ed Skrein made him a lot more likable and interesting last season.

108	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-07	A very solid 8 out of 10. The best premiere since season 1.Â 
Â 
The good
Â 
- The Arthur Dayne and Duncan the Tall namedrops were so awesome. Easily my favourite things of the episode.
- Some of the Hound's lines were hilarious, like "what the fuck is a Lommy," "those people are cunts," and "I don't care if heÂ ateÂ your friend!"
- Cool to see the Dreadfort and Meereen in the intro.
- I may have had to suppress a little fanboy giggle when Doran and Sunspear were namedropped.
- The CGI at the end, of that whole war-torn landscape, was pretty amazing.
- Even though it was kind of random and short, I really liked the Sansa/Dontos scene. It was cool to have him hint at the history of House Hollard. And finally Sansa is getting back to her old, not-that-dumb self.
Â 
The meh
Â 
- Oberyn's introduction. The entire scene in the brothel was completely pointless and served no purpose. I also didn't like Oberyn brutally attacking that Lannister guy. Sure he was a dick, but c'mon. We will see Oberyn's a badass later.
- The Margaery/Brienne scene was completely pointless, since Margaery already doubted Brienne killed Renly, when Loras convinced her.
- Emilia continues to be an actress with zero range of tone and expression, and it made her scenes very dull.
- The Jaime/Tywin confrontation was a bit underwhelming compared to how I thought it would be.
Â 
The bad
Â 
- Olenna Tyrell is seriously getting very annoying and unfunny at this point. She is coming across less witty and more bitchy every episode.
Â 
When that's the only thing that's not that good about an episode though, I'm generally pretty happy. A really good premiere, and hopefully the season continues with this quality.


Agree 100% about Emilia. Â She was so good in Season 1 that I am honestly dumbfounded as to how God awful has become in absolutely every scene she's in. Â They may as well give her those purple lenses now since she's not conveying any emotion anyway...
Â 
I'd mentioned on a different thread that I think the discussion about Renly's death was put in to highlight Margaery's fickleness in contrast to Brienne's steadfast loyalty.
109	rohit39	2014-04-07	I was surprised they recast Daario. The guy is probably my least favorite character in the entire series, but I thought Ed Skrein made him a lot more likable and interesting last season.


Â 
Yeah this is just ridiculous! Fine, i can't expect the Daario from the books with the three pronged blue beard, golden mustache etc, but he needs to be a little flashy/showy, which Ed Skrein kinda was. I liked that Dany ended up attracted to him because it shows that she's still a young girl at heart. Â

I've never been a huge fan of Daario, but I liked old Daario a bit. He had a bit of arrogance to him without being all blue haired and ridiculous. I thought old Daario had a sort of edge to him that that made him unconventionally attractive, which I thought would make sense because you could believe Danny being all girlish and falling for him. This new dude though. Zero charisma.
111	Giorgio Corrado	2014-04-07	Wow what a scene between Arya and the Hound and the way Arya looked when she killed the Tickler when she shoved needle in the Tickler's throut.Â  As for the new character the Prince Oberyn I like him I hope he sticks around for a while anyone think he would make a far better lover for Dany then Daario?

Yup, you nailed it. Oh well, maybe this new Daario will grow on us. 
In all honesty any carbon-based life form would be an improvement on the book Daario: swaggering around in his technicolor pantaloons, fondling his naked lady swords, contemplating which new shade to dye his mustachios... Arghggggh the douchefactor is completely off the charts.
113	Lady Flandrensis	2014-04-07	8.5 So tight! Great dialogue, the acting is all stepped up a notch, everything looked so much more tactile.. And the litttle psycho edge to Arya now is fantastic. Well done, Maisie!
114	thenedstark	2014-04-07	Awesome episode. Oberyn was umatched. Sandor Clegane, as always with his badassery..Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  
Â 
Enjoyed the backstory glimpsed at about the knights of the kingsguard, Arthur Dayne and Duncan the Tall. A clear shoutout to the book fans.

115	lostinwesteros	2014-04-07	I gave it a 9 - first in season is usually a bit disappointing, but this one had some jewels in it.  Hound and chicken scene and Arya getting needle back as well as that horse she wanted.  The statue of Joffery was hilarious. Oberyn is perfectly cast, I think.  Master Aemon's line, "I grew up in King's Landing" and Jon's coming into his own.  
But two things confused me: (1) has the actor playing Pod changed?  He just didn't look the same. (2) what's the deal with Sansa's new handmaiden running to Cercei?  Was that in the books?

Yeah the actor playing Pod looked different but it was the same person. He just had a haircut from previous seasons; its much shorter now. Handmaiden is just being used as a plot device so Cersei can find out about Shae for the trial.Â
119	ivor the swine	2014-04-07	9/10. All caught up nicely. Glad Ser Dontos' role is up and running.
120	Oriolesmagic	2014-04-07	9/10
I thought that this was clearly the most impressive season premiere of the series.
Tywin's scene with Jaime had the potential to be fantastic, but it fell a little flat. (In comparison to my rather lofty expectations, anyway)
New Daario was pretty disappointing, I agree that Old Daario had a much better grasp of the character thus far. Hopefully Huisman will improve throughout the season.
The Thenns were VASTLY different than how I pictured them in the books. (Granted, I'm only halfway through AFFC) I'm not quite sure how I feel about them yet.
Didn't really expect to see Ser Dontos back in the story at all, but I'm glad he seems to be following the storyline in some ways.
Oberyn was phenomenal. Sure, the introduction scene was different, but it kind of had to be. You don't get to have Tyrion thought's tell you about Oberyn's personality, you have to see it firsthand. This scene allowed us to do that.
Lastly, the Hound was amazing. Oh my word, the lines he was giving had me on the floor. His fighting scene was also exactly how I pictured it though.
(For those who haven't read the books, there is a spoiler ahead)...
Â 
Here's a question though, since this Arya/Hound scene happened SO early, could we see Arya in Braavos in Season 4?

121	StormRhage	2014-04-07	Seven.
Â 
Eeeh, it's the season premier episode.Â  Those are never really any great shakes.
Â 
Did a fine job establishing most of the major plotlines of the season, though, and that's really all you can ask.


  ..I gave it a 8
122	Mr Smith	2014-04-07	8, after some consideration. Not everything I hoped for, but a solid start with some very promising setup.
Â 
What I liked:
Â - Kit Harrington finally coming into his own. His scene in front of the NW command was just how I would have wanted it to be; humble, frank, and dispensed with any of the moodiness we've seen from him in previous seasons.
Â - The Dragons. Excellent stuff from the CGI department, and just a glimpse into the mayhem to come.
Â - Tyrion/Shae stuff. Despite the fact that I hated where they've taken Shae in previous seasons, they're handling her the right way in the circumstances, and dispelling any suggestions that they might change her death scene.
Â - Oberyn. He has charisma, sex appeal, and just enough menace to make an impression.
Â - New Daario. Says a lot that he's won me over in a few scenes, but I like the subtlety he brings to the role, which was lacking from the previous actor.
Â - The opening scene. Just a nice way to start the season.
Â 
What I wasn't wild about:
Â - Jaime's 'confrontation' with Tywin, which wasn't that much of a confrontation. Admittedly, I'm not as upset about it as I was at first, but I do feel they could have injected a little more anger into that scene. Jaime seems a little too indifferent for the most part.
Â - The dialogue. Detracted from a lot of good scenes, and is the main reason this score wasn't higher. Detracted from Oberyn's scene with Tyrion, in particular, but there were others. They need to go back to the source material and study Martin's subtlety.
Â - Dontos. That ship had sailed guys. No one will have remembered who he is. You choose not to use him in Season 3, so stick to your convictions, and find Sansa another way out of King's Landing. Also, giving her the necklace and just telling her to wear it is going to come off as a pretty dodgy way to pull off that particular twist. They made a right hash of this one I'm afraid.
Â 
A random thought: I seemed to notice the drawbacks of being a book reader a lot more in this episode. Take Arya and the Hound in the tavern. Thats a scene that's meant to be filled with tension, but because I knew what was coming I was just sort of like 'OK enough with the chicken metaphor and the over the top cruelty of the Lannister soldiers, lets just get on with the fighting already'. You lose something from knowing what's coming. Just a bit of a shame.

Â 

Also, not a fan of new Naharis. Not as arrogant as Skrein.

Â 


Am I the only one so far that DOESN'T like new Daario? I see people saying they like him. I really don't so far. I know it's early, but he's not arrogant enough, and he's missing that edge, that cocky swagger, the smirk, the walk. I don't know. I just don't know.


Â 

- New Daario. Â Old Daario delivered his lines in such an over the top kind of poetic way but it seemed natural and he was on the right side of the sexy vs. sleazy line. Â Altogether I thought Old Daario captured what mattered about Book Daario. Â New Daario has no charisma.
Â 

Â 
Nothing to disagree with here, you've all captured exactly what I'm missing between Faabio Naharis and New Daario, who as I said in another thread, reminds me too much of Jorah.Â  If they added those douchy daggers and had him at least smirk once in a while, he might pull it off.
Â 


10/10, a great start for season 4.Â  The opening scene with Tywin was epic.Â  The dragons look amazing.Â  I think the Tyrion and Oberyn convo was well done.Â  It looks like Pod got really tall, lol.Â Â I'mÂ glad they re-casted Mr. Daario,Â season 4 Daario is a massive upgrade.Â Â I'm glad Thorne and Janos returned, their scene with Jon and Aemon was well delivered.Â  Cersei looks like she's starting to lose it, lol...Jaime did well, and endingÂ with the Hound/Arya was anÂ awesome choice.Â  The music they used when Arya got involved was dark andÂ edgy, it fit perfect.Â  The White BookÂ sceneÂ could be the show's best scene yet.Â 
Â 
And thatÂ statueÂ of Joff...I wantÂ that for my front yard.Â 


Â 
I agree, Cersei is pulling off the abusive, growing unhinged well.Â  And thanks for reminding me of the statue, that was a fantastic detail!Â  Very humorous episode, there was also Jamie waving his gold hand and Marjaery's line about the dead sparrow necklace.
Â 
As for the Thenns, I know they changed them, but did a good job of making them creepy and unlikeable.Â  It's a good nuance, to see that the wildlings don't all get along.
Â 
I have a feeling Sam and Jon are going to be delivering some great scenes this year.Â  Those two and Jaime and Brienne play well together.
Â 
Missed the "is there gold in the village" from Arya, she seemed to really hold back and let the Hound get most of the beating until the end, but as was pointed out earlier, the calculation was pretty chilling.Â  And I really loved the Hound.Â  Wonder what we'll get next week on 'How to start a fight 101'?Â  The quietly delighted look on Arya's face when she sees what he's up to is about as great as the smile she has at the end, riding out with Needle on her belt.
Â 
I'm really hooked on those dragons, am thrilled to get to see them all together, one of my favorite scenes.

Â 
(-) The only big downside for me was Jaime/Brienne/Margeary scenes. Somehow Jaime/Brienne have lost all their weird tension.
Also Tywin opening scene was a bit unfitting for Song of Ice and Fire world for me, its artificiality and maybe even pomposity makes it more of LOTR scene in Peter Jackson's version of it.
Â 
Hound/Arya scene was Â brilliantly staged and played Â (+)
Sansa's frustration and introspectiveness is Â greatly performed Â (+)
Absolutely loved the Martells, vicious and sexy as they should be. (+)
Introduction of rivalry between Jon and Slynt/Thorne alliance was great (+)
Â 
I enjoyed this episode very much.

125	BoldAsYouPlease	2014-04-07	I gave it a 4. Shows like this are why I gave up on the show in the middle of last season. Oberyn Martell was one of my favorite characters when I read ASoS in 2000 - after the Red Wedding I was wondering how Martin could keep disposing of important characters, and then Oberyn showed me how - back then Martin was seemingly able to devise great characters whenever he pleased. The Red Viper was terrific - smart, sly, decadent, a man to fear both as a schemer and as a warrior - and under it all a man burning with the desire to obtain revenge for the murder of his sister. The dialog between him and Tyrion as he approached King's Landing was important and worth multiple reads - full of back-story, new revelations and great quips.
Â 
And they threw that away for the obligatory weekly sex scene in Littlefinger's brothel. The TV Littlefinger is far more sinister than his book counter-part - his establishment has managed to turn sex with good-looking participants into an annoying nuisance, a game-changing achievement the book Littlefinger will have to work to match. I'm trying to think of another show or movie that has been this ham-fisted and inept in getting the sex going, and I can't - hard-core porn directors would call tonight's scene contrived and unnecessary. TV Oberyn, unlike his book counter-part, is so horny and stupid that he rides ahead of his escort into a city teeming with the soldiers of the Tyrells so he can get laid at a brothel. And it's not even a high-class brothel because he's insulted there by some common foot-soldier who apparently recognizes him and thinks it's a good idea to insult a member of the nobility nicknamed the Red Viper. Made no sense at all, and the pretty breasts didn't lend it any sense either.
Â 
The reference to Ser Duncan the Tall wasn't exactly enough to compensate, either, though it was thoughtful of the producers to throw us book-readers a little something to geek out over.
Â 
For me, the Oberyn nonsense was the biggest problem, but there's more - one example: the show's decision to turn Arya's first killing - a moment of pure rage from a little girl who has lost everyone she ever cared about - into several cold-blooded murders complete with Dexter-like taunting. So there it is - a 4 to open the season.
126	changalang	2014-04-07	I feel like I have to defend him, because he's played by one of my favourite actors, but I've said it once, I'll say it again, those who are criticizing the, maybe, 5 minutes of screen time that Michiel had as the new Daario are being kind of ridiculous for two very glaring reasons.
He barely had any screen time.
	The scenes that he had were exposition at most, i.e. acclimating people to the new Daario. Not a lot to work with there, and the little that he did have - I thought he had much more chemistry with Emilia than Fabio Naharis. (Probably because I thought that he looked like he could be a serial killer with those crazy teeth and eyes.)
I'm a huge fan of Michiel from his previous work, so I'm obviously biased, but this is the same man who, with limited screen time, charmed his way (on screen, of course) into the beds of two leading ladies on Nashville; made a drug-addled, egotistical jerkface junkie bearable on Treme; and is creeping back into the heart of the very talented Tatiana Maslany on Orphan Black. I think, or more so, I know, that with more screen time he's going to be amazing opposite Emilia.
Â 
To be honest, as a huge fan I think he did a fine job with what little he was given. His little smirk when he answers, "The honour of riding by your side on the road to Mereen," his (possibly below the belt, both literal and figurative) dig at Grey Worm, and the "Your grace" and smile that he gives her when he presenting the flowers. Small things, I know, but it's the small things that make you fall in love *wink*.
Â 
I'll also say this again: yes, he's not as arrogant or smarmy as the Daario of old. But is Show!Dany even interested in that? Maybe Book!Dany is taken by Daario's flamboyant personality and look, but the way that Emilia plays Dany, I feel like she would fall for a subtler Daario than Ed's portrayal last season. But maybe that's just me.

Â 
Eeeh, it's the season premier episode.Â  Those are never really any great shakes.
Â 
Did a fine job establishing most of the major plotlines of the season, though, and that's really all you can ask.


Â 
Spot on. Enjoyed the Oberyn conversation with Tyrion and enjoyed Pedro more in the role then I thought I would. Very good choice.
Â 
Found Tyrion/Shae and the Sandor fight choreography a little underwhelming.
Â 
Seven, overall. Solid start to the season. Did well to set the stage for all the amazing moments that are coming.
128	Sun	2014-04-07	An 8.
Loved it. A great season opener, the best since the pilot. The look on Aria's face in as she rode into the camera on that white horse with a smile on her face with swelling music in the background actually brought tears to my eyes. Tears of gratification that at least one Stark has won a small victory (and this from I'm a bookreader lol - I was completely sold on the moment). I have quibbles, hence the 8, but no real complaints, which in itself so refreshing for me when it comes to this show.

129	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-07	Thenn out of 10 from me
Â 
Just amazing. I jumped up out of my seat when the Hound started fighting.Â 
Â 
Oberyn was amazing. They have never introduced a character so well. The brothel fight scene was brilliant. The actor has really captured his confidence and recklessness.
Â 
New Daario is more believable than the last one but he seems a bit plain. Absolutely hate his book character so maybe D & D will make him better.
Â 
The Thenns were awesome. I can't wait to see them attack Castle Black. Janos Slynt could have done with an introduction for show only viewers. They showed Ser Dontos in the trailer so it was strange not to see Janos being sent to the wall by Tyrion.
Â 
Its also great to see them saying the war is not over while Stannis lives and that they are still talking about the siege. Last season there was barely any mention of the Battle of Blackwater. From what I remember it was only ever mentioned by Roose Bolton.Â
130	Currawong	2014-04-07	Good solid opening episode for the season, gave it an 8 but I'd have liked to give it an 8.5.Â  It moved far better than I thought it would, and it was interesting to see how they gave viewers some key bits of background or reminded them of others.Â Â  I know some readers have been upset at the lack of mention about Rhaegar and Ellaria before now, but really, it made much more sense in the context of a TV show to wait for S4 and bring them up when Oberyn is in KL to avenge his sister.Â  For Unsullied viewers, I suspect those details would have been missed completely if they'd been mentioned in earlier seasons.Â Â  Also interesting to get mention of Ser Arthur Dayne and Duncan the Tall, plus a reminder about Brienne's oath to avenge Renly.Â 
Â 
Things that were a bit 'meh'- Tyrion and Shae, and also Yet Another Dany march to Yet Another City.Â  Dany is not my favourite character, but it all looked so very deja vu, just with children instead of adult slaves.Â  She needs to get some training advice for those dragons - where's Cesar Millan when you really need him?!
Â 
The only thing that I thought really let the episode down and should have been better staged was where Tyrion waited for the Dornish.Â  Tyrion was supposed to be representing King Joffrey and meeting a Prince from Dorne!Â Â  So why were he, Bronn and Pod just hanging about under some tree looking like a group of vagrants?Â Â  I half expected to see a litter of wine flagons around them.Â Â  If Peter Dinklage doesn't like riding horses, then they should at least have set up some sort of formal welcome pavillion where the KL contingent could wait in appropriate formal state.Â Â  I am sure they would have had a spare little awning or something that could double up from the wedding!
131	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-07	An ok episode. I give it a 6.Â
132	ivor the swine	2014-04-07	Was a little confused why they recast Daario, but still decide not to at least add a slight tint of colour to his facial hair :-/
133	Lord Joker Of FunLand	2014-04-07	For me, the Oberyn nonsense was the biggest problem, but there's more - one example: the show's decision to turn Arya's first killing - a moment of pure rage from a little girl who has lost everyone she ever cared about - into several cold-blooded murders complete with Dexter-like taunting.

She killed the frey soldier in that pure rage moment, in the season final of season 3.Â 
Â 
If they keep doing the "Rage" killing, it would be boring.
Â 
Now they are trying to show she has changed.

Â 
This seems to be the "official" story, but he was cast in the Transporter reboot quite a few months after Michiel was announced as his replacement. A little fishy.
136	The hairy bear	2014-04-07	A seven, for me.
Â 
Arya+The Hound's final scene was excellent (although I would have preferred if Arya had killed Polliver as in the books, screaming and with in a mad frenzy). And Pedro Pascal is a perfect Oberyn so far. But most of the other stuff could have been done better, IMO.
137	Rashtibram	2014-04-07	This was a pretty excellent episode on the whole, especially when you consider that it's a season premiere (arguably the most difficult to write and direct). It's already noticeable that the absence of Robb/Cat and the merging of the Jaime/Brienne and King's Landing arcs is a huge advantage for the showrunners, and the concise nature of the episode (almost exclusively focusing on the various KL relationships and Dany) really helped to give it a sense of momentum and pacing which last season's 'Valar Dohaeris' lacked. A couple of frustrating â<U+0080><U+0093> albeit minor â<U+0080><U+0093> flaws kept it from surpassing season 2's 'The North Remembers' (still, IMO, the best premiere so far) but I can honestly say that this episode succeeded in meeting my high expectations in spectacular style, and next week looks even better.
Â 
Edited to add a couple of specifics. I pretty much loved all of the King's Landing scenes: the wordless, artfully directed cold opening, the nice bit of fan-service in the White Book scene, everything Sansa (whose characterization looks to be right back on track with the books), Jaime struggling to find himself with Brienne and Cerseiâ<U+0080>¦the list goes on. On my first viewing, Oberyn's introduction seemed quite cheesy and over the top, and there are still certain aspects of the scene that I question, but upon a second re-watch it definitely holds up. I think I was a bit jaded by my prior knowledge of the character, but as an introduction I'd say it worked, and it certainly did its job in the memorability department. Anyway, his subsequent interaction with Tyrion had me nearly jumping out of my seat in a wave of fanboy craze, so there's something.
Â 
With regards to Dany: the sequence with the dragons was excellent â<U+0080><U+0093> the special effects team outdoes themselves once again â<U+0080><U+0093> but Daario's recasting created a jarring and disconcerting atmosphere, as they seem to have changed his personality as well as his physical appearance (from strong and poetic to generically masculine). All of Dany's scenes on their own were quite good, but this blaring inconsistency just took me out of the world whenever Daario was on-screen.
Â 
The tavern brawl was, IMO, one of the best sequences the show has done to date; while I'm still not sure about the adaptation choice (having the Hound injured in a different way, presumably to extend the popular relationship between him and Arya), the writing, acting and directing were all superb and on the whole brilliantly pulled off a scene which could easily have seemed redundant (as we already saw a glimpse of Arya's brutality in 3x10, and otherwise the only legitimate plot development was her recovery of Needle). Pretty much every detail of the scene deserves a mention in the "Positive Nitpick" thread, and that's saying something.
Â 
Arguably the weakest aspect of the episode was the arc at the Wall. I was slightly indifferent to the Jon scene; it mostly just seemed like a bit of a let down after the implications of his material in last season's finale, and I was undoubtedly left with a couple of nagging questions (did Sam ever tell Jon that he met his brother at the Nightfort? And why was Maester Aemon just able to effortlessly override Thorne, who is apparently acting Lord Commander in the show?), but on the whole it wasn't enough to be a real detriment to the episode. The Thenns, on the other handâ<U+0080>¦I guess there wasn't really anythingÂ badÂ about their introduction, per se, but the cartoonish reveal that they were cannibals wasn't handled well to say the least, and there were times when it felt like they had gotten lost on their way to do battle with Leonidas and the 300 Spartans.
Â 
Overall, though, despite my quibbles, I really did love this episode. I debated my rating for quite some time; after holding it at a seven for a while in a rush of initial "It's finally here!" excitement, I eventually decided against speaking such high praise so early in the season â<U+0080><U+0093> especially when said season has so many spectacular episodes/events to look forward to â<U+0080><U+0093> and gave it a "solid" six (which is actually a good score for me: I haven't given out a ten yet, and 'Blackwater' is the only episode so far to have pulled a nine). Soâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
6/10
Â 
'Two Swords' falls 18th out of 31 on my list of best-to-worst GOT episodes.
Â 
(Sidenote: my friend gets her first cameo as one of Margaery Tyrell's cousins! She's the one the camera focuses on when Olenna tells them to go speak to the jewelers of King's Landing).

New Daario >>> Old Daario
Â 
The Tywin-Jaime scene lacked tension and was overall dull. Like really dull. Compared to the scene in the books, where Tywin and Jaime were boiling.

139	Ran	2014-04-07	245 votes in, the episode is rating an average of 8.29. Removing the top and bottom 5% to normalize, it hits 8.39. Median vote is presently 8, but it's neck and neck with 9.
140	Lady Beyond the Wall	2014-04-07	I give it an 8. The montage of Ned's sword being swung by him, and then through him, followed by the opening of Tywin having the new swords forged and burning the wolf pelt scabbard. The forging of the swords happens "off screen" in the books, so that was a treat. Also Joffrey was brief but brilliantly villainous. Not sure how I feel about the twist on the Thenns, guess that will have to wait to see how it's played out.
141	Tori Targaryen	2014-04-07	It gets an automatic 10 just for GOT finally being back on the screen, but overall I'd say a healthy 8. Great way to start the season and get us warmed up again
142	TheEvilKing	2014-04-07	I gave it an 8 on the arbitrary number scale.
Â 
Pros:
First and last scenes
Joffrey
Joffrey statue
Hot ass Ellaria Sand
The wildling/Wall scenes were actually really good
Â 
Cons:
Too much relationship drama
All the Dany scenes were cringeworthy up until the crucified slave girl
Too much Sansa
A little exposition heavy
143	Jamie Lannister	2014-04-07	7/10. Decent opener.
Â 
Tywin's "disowning" of Jaime counts for a point lost though. It felt rushed and without any urgency on either of their parts. When Jaime mentioned being disowned, I was baffled; his entire conversation with Tywin felt watered down from the book equivalent and amounted to a relatively minor spat, without a whole lot said.Â 
Â 
The really passive way they seeded Sansa's necklace irked me too. There should've been more emphasis put on the importance of her specifically wearing it at the wedding.

I think they're trying to avoid telegraphing to non-readers that something is afoot.
Â 
Then again, having Dontos suddenly show up kinda already does that.
145	Beric175	2014-04-07	I actually liked that they merged the Thenns with the cannibals just so we could get a sense of the Magnar being an actual threat that we hadn't encountered before. The Arya scene was gold and of course Oberyn was awesome. 9/10. Bring on the PW.
146	Fool for Roose	2014-04-07	It wasn't too loaded and it established many necessary points needed for the rest of the season. I really enjoyed it. Pedro Pascal as Oberyn just perfect! Arya and Sandor--AMAZING; they made me want chicken! 9/10
147	MarcusLloydAK	2014-04-07	I gave it a 9/10. Was good being introduced to most characters again

Â 
Now in the books, like you said, it was "I HAVE NO SON!!!" all the way.

149	The Anti-Targ	2014-04-07	8. It worked for me, a good strong start to the season, touching base with most of the main characters in a meaningful way. Bringing back some long lost characters. A decent enough intro for Oberyn.
150	sati	2014-04-07	8,7/10 - very good premiere, mostly because that impressive cold open and setting up everything so well
151	Darkbringer	2014-04-07	Am I the only one so far that DOESN'T like new Daario? I see people saying they like him. I really don't so far. I know it's early, but he's not arrogant enough, and he's missing that edge, that cocky swagger, the smirk, the walk. I don't know. I just don't know. I have a feeling he will contemptuously kill the Champion of Meereen, maybe he will seem more swaggering then. But I kinda agree.
152	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-04-07	8 - great episode, their strongest premiere yet.
ETA: Just like to add that Oberyn was fucking awesome when he spoke to Tyrion. You could definitely feel the rage.

153	Darkbringer	2014-04-07	I give it 9/10 of my stolen chickens.
154	The Killer Snark	2014-04-07	First of all, the nits should be addressed so they can be got out the way as soon as possible. I'm not too keen on the slightly PC-conscious whitewashing of the opportunistic (in the novels) Shae and Cersei. Everyone who's read the books will know that two of the scenes they are involved in treat their characters at odds with the way they actually behave in the book series, so I wonder how the writers are going to deal with Cersei's batshit zaniness when adapting her chapters in the fourth book. I'm not keen on the way the Thenns and the natives of Skagos were shoved together. On with the positives:
Â 
I think the casting and treatment of Oberyn is great, and has been well worth waiting for, and despite objectively not a massive deal happening in this episode, the diversity of scene and pacing meant that it just flew by. The final Arya and Sandor scene was excellent, though technically it actually arrived too soon in narrative-matching terms, which means that Arya will indeed be in Braavos by the end of the fourth season; it is shown in one of the trailers. Maisie Williams has grown into the progressing complexities of her character by growing into a very good actress. Oberyn is one of the only characters so far in the series whose physical appearance and general deportment are pretty much in keeping with the character in the books. The Daenarys scenes will just continue to get slower and slower, but the writers will just have to make the most of it. The dragons scene was very cool. We all know with the next episode what we're going to be in for, so if this episode were totally perfect, I'd still hesitate to give it full marks until I've viewed the second to compare them, but on its own terms I'm perfectly happy to give this one a nine. Probably the strongest opening episode we've had in Game of Thrones so far.
Â 
Darkbringer - I prefer the old Daario also. It might at least have been better if he looked physically similar to the one they had before, but even his body language is different. It's not the actor's fault, but until and unless he grows on me I think it's a miscast.

155	rhymeswithleek	2014-04-07	Gets a solid 8 from me, 8.5 let's say (though I didn't round up to a 9 on this occasion).
Â 
Great Oberyn intro, nice scenes with Jaime/Cersie/Olenna/Brienne at King's Landing. Stygg had a good introduction as well, there was a lot of exposition and introductions that's my main gripe really. It was the premiere though and thought they've never been amazing I's say this was the strongest opener since season 1. And the Joffrey statue! Lol.
Â 
Something wrong with you leg boy? The Hound and Arya's tavern brawl was obviously the stand out moment here, loved it, the whole scene was spot on. But I notice the Hound isn't wounded like he was in the book, look's like they're going to continue the road trip a little longer than expected.Â 
Â 
Ser Dontos! At last, I doubt most watchers will have thought the scene anything but filler, they'll realise its importance shortly.
Â 
Dany's scenes were meh, but it's good to see the dragons have grown larger and I like the new Daario better than the old one, more charismatic, less slimy, which is good cos I ain't a fan of the Dany/Daario storyline as it is.
Â 
Great opener, sowed the seeds nicely for things to come, capped off with some kick ass revenge in its final moments.
156	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-04-07	9/10
Here's a question though, since this Arya/Hound scene happened SO early, could we see Arya in Braavos in Season 4?

	Spoiler Yes, the Titan is in one of the trailers.

Though I suppose it would give him more screen time, which might actually be a bad thing, given D&D's track record.

160	protar	2014-04-07	7/10. It's the premier, so it's never going to be too flashy but it's probably the best premier since the first season. Did it's job introducing the new characters and recapping what had been before, with a great final scene.
161	NaarioDaharis	2014-04-07	I'm going to give it a 9 due to some discrepancies.
Â 
The Oberyn scene was a little over the top, but his character is over the top. That's why he only lasts a short time in the books. He has to be established quickly and in an interesting way. We got everything we need to know about the Viper and the Dornish from that one scene.
Â 
Arya and the Hound, humorous. I am interested to see where they are taking their storyline, since I am assuming that inn was where he is originally wounded in the books.
Â 
Jon finally became an interesting character. In the show, he's always come across as an entitled butthole with no real personality. Maybe the actor took some classes or this scene just struck him right, because I was finally rooting for him.
Â 
The dragons looked good, and I don't think dragons are cool, haha, so props to the CGI team.
Â 
The new Daario is not Daario Naharis. I don't know why they refuse to work his character similar to the book Daario. This one is goofy and lighthearted. The flower thing was comical and not right for the character, but it is establishing his and Dany's relationship.
Â 
Arya's fighting was a little ridiculous at moments. There was no buildup to her being a competent fighter. She just suddenly was and it looked like a comic book adaptation.
Â 
My favorite season premier of all. SO happy my man Oberyn is in town.Â 
Â 
Looking forward to next week's episode =)

Tywin's "disowning" of Jaime counts for a point lost though. It felt rushed and without any urgency on either of their parts. When Jaime mentioned being disowned, I was baffled; his entire conversation with Tywin felt watered down from the book equivalent and amounted to a relatively minor spat, without a whole lot said.Â 
Â 
The really passive way they seeded Sansa's necklace irked me too. There should've been more emphasis put on the importance of her specifically wearing it at the wedding.


Being forewarned, I was prepared not to like it, but when I watched, I thought it was rather clever to have Jaime say No! so quietly.Â  Yes, it was very different to the angry scene in the book, but that occurred almost immediately after Jaime returned to KL, just after the sept-sex scene and when Jaime is still furious about what he's just found out about the whole KL situation.Â  The show's altered timeline means he's been in KL a little while before this scene.Â  I got the impression that Tywin was almost expecting Jaime to be angry and was prepared to deal with that - he seemed almost disconcerted when Jaime was so calm about things.Â Â  Having successfully bullied Cersei and Tyrion in Season 3, I don't think Tywin expected Jaime of all people to say no to him in such measured terms.Â Â  Yes, it's a shame we didn't get the 'I don't want your Rock' andÂ  'You are not my son!' bits but I am sure there is plenty of room left for Tywin/Jaime drama.Â

163	Ferrum Aeternum	2014-04-07	8/10. Â Very good, not perfect. Â Better than last season's premiere for sure. Â 
Â 
Loved Oberyn's introduction and his scene with Tyrion. Â I approve strongly of the direction they've taken with this iconic character. Â I can't wait to see what he gets into next, which I believe is the point.Â 
Â 
The Arya/Hound stuff was fantastic. Â The decision to have her take direct revenge on Polliver (rather than the book's focus on the Tickler's torture litany) was a great change for television. Â Also, "What the fuck's a Lommy?" might be the funniest line ever uttered on the show. Â  Â 
Â 
Sansa/Dontos was rushed and confusing, but that's to be expected seeing how Dontos hasn't spoken a line in nearly two full seasons. Â Interesting that D&D at first eliminated the character and then decided to bring him back, once they figured out Sansa's story doesn't work all that well without him. Â 
Â 
Jon's stuff at the Wall was very good. Â Three cheers for the return of Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt!
Â 
New Daario is gonna have to grow on me. Â I wasn't impressed at all.
164	Ser Graymax	2014-04-07	A strong 9 from me.Â 
Â 
I dont see much room for improvement except the scene between Jamie and his Father.Â  Should have been much more powerful IMHO.Â  Almost didnt recognize Jamie with his new haircut, doesnt fit well but that has little to do with the show.
Â 
I was worried about the actor they chose for the Red Viper but he seems to fit well.Â  Tall, slim and fast makes him very snakelike.Â  Doesnt really look like a great warrior though so wondering about him in a big one on one.
Â 
Do the Thenns look like the descendants of Xerxes from The 300 to anyone else?
165	hhh	2014-04-07	7.5. This is my first time watching having read all the books and it makes a big difference to my position as a viewer. I definitely agree the exposition could've been a lot more subtle for its purposes, though it did a great recap job. Some character moments were quite stiff like Sansa/Dontos + Tywin/Jaime. Wall stuff was good but the way they presented the Thenns was soo heavy-handed.  It kinda takes away from Jon's tolerant relations with the wildings, would've been more precise to scrap the 'evil' aspect for a menacing feeling to the in-group tensions. However really nice highlights with callbacks to Arthur Dayne, Rhaegar&Elia, Dunk and even a blue rose appearance.  Oberyn, Arya and the Hound had awesome dynamics as well!
166	Ser Lawrence	2014-04-07	Gave it a 9.Â  Probably should have been more like an 8, but I'm still in the after-glow of getting our show back.Â 
Â 
I started to feel like the introduction of the Red Viper was a bit rushed, and I missed the elegance of he and Tyrion's verbal jousting while riding into the city.Â  This version of Oberyn seems more full-throtle and less subtle...
Â 
...then, I realize that the P.W. is next week!!Â  OK, I'm in.Â  Sex and Blood, baby.
Â 
The Hound's character arc fits right in withÂ Tyrion, Dany, and Jaime.Â  As soon as he starts doing things because they are right, or shows the slightest bit of moral character, bad things will happen to him.
Â 
While the mash-up of the Thens merged with other wildling tribes was somewhat offputing to a reader, this treatmentÂ did make them way more menacing.Â  Plus, the show (I think) does a little better job of confirming just how rare it is to get all the "Free Folk" to cooperate in anything and what a job Mance has done (and how skeptical everyone that is not Jon is about the impending attack).
Â 
Love Margaey's "string of sparrow heads" comment.
167	Bonifer Tasty	2014-04-07	Pointless?
Here's what the pointless brothel scene accomplished:
1. Intro to the red viper and Ellaria and their unique relationship
2. Showed oberyn's voracious sexual appetites.
3. Showed oberyn's hair trigger temper and loathing for lannisters
4. Showed oberyn's fighting prowess
But yeah other than that it was pointless and a disgraceful mangling of the holy source material.


Â 
All this for what the brothel scene accomplished in terms of character introduction. Â I also wonder if there is one more aspect to it that will play out. Â  I am guessing the blade through the Lannister's hand was poisoned, and we will learn next episode that the soldier died. Â They can't really go into Oberyn's backstory as a poisoner (VIPER!) without introducing history and characters that the show watcher will find confusing. Â This will do it quickly and efficiently. Â I mean, they HAVE to make him suspected of poisoning, no?
168	RhaenysBalerion	2014-04-07	8/10
Â 
Genius: Pedro Pascal, Tywin melting down the Stark symbols, dragons
Great: Oberyn stabbing random Lannister, Ellaria/Oberyn, Arthur Dayne and Rhaegar/Elia mention
Funny: Margaery's necklace comment, Joff's statue, "What the fuck's a Lommy?", Bronn/Oberyn exchange, Jon's comment on Janos Slynt, Aemon's King's Landing comment
Lame: tavern fight scene, Brienne/Tyrells scene
Disappointment: new Daario Naharis (they can't get it right)
169	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-07	Well that would piss me off.
	Spoiler Wildling attack at the Wall? The Night's Watch needs my help? Might as well take a detour to Braavos.
Though I suppose it would give him more screen time, which might actually be a bad thing, given D&D's track record.



Â 
Â 

	Spoiler  Ya most people were speculating they would be using it as a plot device since he deals with those people in ADWD
170	Queen Sansa Stark	2014-04-07	I will give it a 6.5 not overly bad, but not very special imo.Â
171	rmholt	2014-04-07	The dragon scene was incredible! I don't care if the next big battle had to be reduced to a knife fight $$$ . Nice save of Arya tavern scene given she already killed the Tickler. And the blue roses! Salut to GRRM's opus
172	Waylin Stark	2014-04-07	A solid 8.
I didn't expect the premiere episode to be this good.
Â 
The melting of Ice was a terrific scene. You could see Tywin gloating.
Â 
Oberyn's intro was awesome. We learned he's a dangerous badass in minutes.
Â 
Dany's dragons seem really dangerous.
Â 
The seeds of conflict between Tyrion and Shae are beginning to grow well.
Â 
Joffrey continues to be a little shit by mocking Jaime.
Â 
The Thenns' intro was scary enough. You could feel the dangerous air surrounding them.
Â 
But the best scene was the last - Arya's.
The fight at the inn was amazing.
And the way she proceeded to stab Polliver through the Neck while mocking him as he remembered - DAMN!

174	rmholt	2014-04-07	First of all, the nits should be addressed so they can be got out the way as soon as possible. . I'm not keen on the way the Thenns and the natives of Skagos were shoved together. On with the positives:

Â 
So much this!Â  The first thing that popped into my head when they showed Styr fully the first time was "Holy shit! They cast the God King for this."
177	WhatIsDeadMayNeverLive	2014-04-07	7/10. Decent, but nothing spectacular. The dialogue was not as sharp as in S3E10 which I watched just before S4E01 to refresh my memory.
178	Drogo_1	2014-04-07	I would give this a solid 9.Â Â  "What the fuck is a lommy?" best line in the episode
179	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-07	I voted 8. I thought it was a great episode for one main reason: They've successfully tied together so many old arcs and histories since season 1 so that the story as a whole seems complete, and moving on logically from the aftermath of all the crap that happened in the first three seasons. It's as if after 3 years the characters have reunited, and we revisit the stories from when they initially left off at the beginning of the war. We had:
Â 
- Tywin sees Jaime since he fled the capital after fighting Ned and awards him with a reforged version of the sword with which he fought. Only Jaime isn't quite the same man.
- Brienne meets with Margaery to discuss Renly's death after fleeing out of fear of being accused, some possible relationship there.
- Jon is back at Castle Black after 2 years, perspective changed, but the wall is more or less the same, so there'll be some friction there as well as an upcoming battle.
- Arya gets revenge against Polliver and retrieves the blade Jon gives her in Episode 1/2, literally and symbolically arming herself for the future.
- Sansa reunites with Dontos, the man she saves in S02E01, who looks to play some role in her misery in KL.
- Many mentions of Stannis Baratheon's siege and defeat.
Â 
It just seems that the story has now reset, and we're moving into the new act, but they did a great job of bringing everything together to remind the audience of how all the characters tie in together, and to show the aftermath of all the events we previously watched. It's a wonderful setup episode, and I'm really looking forward to the upcoming episodes.Â

180	cybobbie	2014-04-07	I gave 9/10 because in my opinion ot was the best premiere since the first season and as many it was a great feeling to have the series back.
Â 
The only parts that I didn't like much were the ones with Jannie, because it kinds of out of place, but I get that since they brought him back earlier they would have to do something about it. Apart from that loved most of the scenes and mainly loved many of the lines in the episode, specially the Hound ones in the end.
Â 
The last scene with Aria was awesome and I have to say that for a moment her happy face during her revenge gave me the creeps.Â
181	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-07	I'm really confused about some of you being disappointed with the tavern fight. I thought it was great.Â
182	Valerie Estelle Frankel	2014-04-07	There was an awful lots of exposition...every single moment except Arya's fight in fact. Every single character felt the need to say, "Hey, here's what happened to me in season two" except for Oberyn (who wasn't saying that and had a lovely delivery). I felt bored. New confrontations Olenna-Margaery, Brienne-Jaime-Sansa and Brienne-Margaery had potential, but they all fell flat. Jaime shrugs off his debt to Sansa and Brienne has no good answer...in the current circumstances she could walk up to Sansa and vow to protect her or ask if she wants to escape. The necklace scene was pointless (except for the apt line about dead sparrows) and who honestly still cares about Renly? Okay, Brienne, but the Brienne-Loras confrontation from the book was more interesting because they both cared. Margaery doesn't.Â And the White Book had far less point than in the books, though Joff shows he's a jerk to everyone. All right, King's Landing characters got their cameos and showed off the relationships, but nothing moved forwards. Â Maybe a 4

183	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-07	8.5 so I rounded it up to 9 since it was the premier.
Â 
I think it has been the best premier, even better than the pilot. The pacing was good and not too busy and complex.Â 
Â 
The opening linked back to Season 3, setting the ground with the Starks being defeated and the Lannisters at their strongest....adding irony to their fall this Season. Karma is a bitch!Â  Â  I also loved how they played on this with details of the RW still being brought up (Sansa mentioning what they did with her mothers body....I smell the LS plot line), the Riverlands a mess and that ridiculous Joffrey/slain wolf statue. Jon's reaction to Robb's death could have been better though....his brother was brutally murdered...not just his rival.
Â 
Oberyn's introduction clearly made him a dangerous and interesting character to keep an eye on.
Â 
Also, no wrong can be done in showing the Dragons have got bigger and more deadly. The Unsullied love dragons!
Â 
Ending the episode with the best scene (Arya and the Hound) really sealed the quality of the episode. All in all, I was really impressed!

184	Tears of Lys	2014-04-07	Voted it an 8. Watched it twice. Didn't care for the Thenns being made into cannibals. Was that ever in the book??They stand out enough as they are!Wasn't sure about Jon's reaction to Robb's murder. Thought it would have hit him more. Seems he's just moved on to bigger problems - maybe that's the point, though.LOVED, OTOH, the tavern scene. Loved in a squicky way, actually, since Arya's dispatching of the people was so... deliberate and calculated and quiet. Not at all like the Hound's slash and pummel - which of course stands to reason. He's practically a giant and she's a little girl. But man, that was brutal to watch. I almost turned away - which even the Red Wedding didn't make me do. It certainly cemented the way Arya's character is turning out.Loved Marjorie (sp?) I enjoy watching her almost as much as any other character - certainly more than Cersei.ETA: Oh, and what the hell are they doing to Daario Naharis? I don't get his character at ALL.

185	Commander Vimes	2014-04-07	8/10
Â 
A very solid start of this season. I have to say how surprised I was by the incredible improvement in Kit Harington's acting. FinallyÂ  . The whole scene with the "trial" was delightful to watch.
Â 
All in all, I couldn't wait for next week (Jack Gleeson will be surely missed; the way he acted in that scene with the White Book was both amazing and hilarious, such a pity that he means to quit his career)
186	King Tyrion I	2014-04-07	9/10.
Â 
Great job for Sophie Turner. Really.
Â 
Can't wait for next week.
187	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-07	9/10
Â 
Obviously there's always going to be a lot of exposition and slow building in a first episode, but overall they did a good job of it and it was probably the 2nd best pilot behind the show's first ever episode. Placing the tavern scene at the end was clever; they knew that they had given a lot of exposition and talking in the episode, but managed to keep interest with some good action at the end.
188	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-07	There was an awful lots of exposition...every single moment except Arya's fight in fact.

Obviously you have the right to your opinion, but it seems like you missed the point of a lot of the scenes about which you're complaining (which may help explain why you didn't enjoy them).
Â 

	Spoiler If you've read the books then you should know exactly why the necklaces matter and why Margaery's apathy toward her dead husband is relevant.
189	jarl the climber	2014-04-07	I'm really confused about some of you being disappointed with the tavern fight. I thought it was great.Â 


I thought the tavern scene was much better than the brothel scene with Oberyn, I had some small problems with it but it helped nudge the episode up to a 7. Oberyn was too over the top, I'd have liked it if they had eased into things a little bit more with him. Still overall they got more things right than wrong.
190	Lyanna's Winter Rose	2014-04-07	7/10
It was a good episode but not great.
191	David Selig	2014-04-07	I thought the tavern scene was much better than the brothel scene with Oberyn,


Talk about damning with faint praise.
192	DarkGeomancer	2014-04-07	8/10
Â 
I would say it's the best premiere so far. Loved Arya's scene, but on the other hand, kind of hated that wildlings scene.
193	Northbound2.0	2014-04-07	Gave it an 8. The episode, did a great job in setting up the rest of the season. Fine work, by all the actors. For me being a Jon fan in the books, I really loved his scene in the episode and the job Kit did. For the most part, I haven't been pleased with Kit's job....until last night. His voice was deeper and more forceful and he seemed really sure of him self. I hope it's a sign of things to come, from Kit. The Hound and Arya stole the entire episode.
194	The Killer Snark	2014-04-07	DarkGeomancer - Yeah, the cannibalism thing seemed off to me; the other wildlings still have standards. I dislike it when the writers tone things down, but it tends to seem a bit incongruous and self-conscious when they try to make certain things more lurid than in the books. I'm reminded of Stannis' jarred foetus collection in that infamous moment in season 3.
195	BlackTalon	2014-04-07	Â 
Arya's fighting was a little ridiculous at moments. There was no buildup to her being a competent fighter. She just suddenly was and it looked like a comic book adaptation.
Â 


Â 
You seem to have forgotten all those hours and hours of practice with her "dancing master" ...
196	Jambottle Jeebus	2014-04-07	I friggin loved the episode... 9/10
I'm one of the few book reader's that doesn't mind when things aren't the same as the books, I can't complain . Honestly, the show is too good .
It's insane to enjoy a TV show as much as I love this show.
197	bronnie	2014-04-07	Does any1 feel like what Oberyn said about Rhaegar, the name drop of Ser Arthur Dayne and the blue rose are hints for R+L = J?
198	A Man Of Iron	2014-04-07	7/10. It was a fine "let's catch up with all the characters" episode but nothing more.
199	KingSlayer510	2014-04-07	I'd give it an 8. It included some of my favorite scenes in the book, tywin and Jaime discussing his future, and the brawl at the inn. I thought it was funny Arya in GoT broke from the books for this scene but the show reminded me if the recent "mercy" chapter that was released. Plus all dragon scenes are welcome. I appreciate that they include small details from the books, like Daario bringing Dany flowers from the countryside and the 163 "road markers"  looking forward to seeing Meereen get sacked.
200	KingSlayer510	2014-04-07	Does any1 feel like what Oberyn said about Rhaegar, the name drop of Ser Arthur Dayne and the blue rose are hints for R+L = J? I think the show has slowly started filling in the history of Westeros, and last night was the first time anyone mentioned Lyanna Stark in years. Rhaegar has been referenced a lot on the show though
201	DarkGeomancer	2014-04-07	DarkGeomancer - Yeah, the cannibalism thing seemed off to me; the other wildlings still have standards. I dislike it when the writers tone things down, but it tends to seem a bit incongruous and self-conscious when they try to make certain things more lurid than in the books.


Yeah, and it would be "okay" if they choose some random clan to be cannibal, but aren't the Thenns the more westerosi clan?
202	The Killer Snark	2014-04-07	I think they're located northwest of the Wall, but I might be totally wrong.
203	Labirints	2014-04-07	Sansa is unbelievably boring, same goes for Tyrion's whore. Other than that the episode was great.Â
204	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-07	Do we know if this premiere's ratings record broke last seasons?Â
205	Warhawk137	2014-04-07	Yeah, and it would be "okay" if they choose some random clan to be cannibal, but aren't the Thenns the more westerosi clan?


Â 
In theory yeah, but there's only so many clans you can put in the show and expect people to follow along.Â  And what few clans you do include have to be noticably distinct.
Â 
I'm not sure about the cannibalism thing either, but I don't mind the idea of them changing the Thenns a bit.

Real-life swords aren't actually THAT heavy (even a large two-handed sword would be less than ten pounds), and as I recall the point of the heavy wooden training sword was to build up her strength.

216	Seneti	2014-04-07	8/10
Â 
The good:
- the opening scene with the destruction of Ice
- more Lannister family drama
- lots of setting up Shae's future role
- Sansa and Jon reacting to the RW
- Oberyn and Ellaria (all of their scenes)Â  
- Olenna being nonchalantly awesome
- Arya getting Needle back
- Sansa's hairnet replacement
- Aemon's answer to how he can tell lies from truthsÂ  
- Drogon snapping at Dany
Â 
The bad:
- very dialogue-heavy and slow (as is normal for the season opener)
- don't like what they did with the Thenns
- the scene between Joffrey, Meryn and Jaime was completely underwhelming
Â 
The ugly:
- Jaime's golden hand looked completely different in my head

217	flamingothegreen	2014-04-07	I gave it a 10/10 because so far, it's my favourite premiere for the series and the last 10-15 were fantastic. c:
I didn't have many issues with the rest of the episode, but would need to rewatch later. o;
218	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-07	I agree. This might be my favorite premiere or at least tied with the series premiere. I thought the pacing was perfect. At the end of each scene I thought to myself I can't wait to see what happens next! So naturally I am already dying to see what happens in episode 2.Â

I liked the Arya fight scene at the inn; Tywin reforging Ice (incredible with that music); Sansa had also some good scenes; I like where they are going with Shae; Nikolaj's acting is amazing, mainly in that scene with Cersei; a strange Thenns introduction, not sure about that roasted arm, but not overly disappointing or anything like that; the Jon Snow scene was well-done; that crucified child was pretty creepy. The Oberyn introduction was fine, I enjoyed the scene where he talked with Tyrion alone the most, Pedro Pascal will be great throughout the whole season, I think. I guess I will re-watch it.
Overall, a solid episode with some great moments and amazing acting, it is noticeable they have more money for CGI, which is great and the episode follows the finale of the third season very nicely. Of course there are some lines and moments that will feel cheesy or out-of-character but I think it is unavoidable in the premiere episode considering casual and new viewers, nothing particularly bad, as I say. It sets up great things to come and contains many highlight moments.
220	Jaqen H'gcarl	2014-04-07	Felt a little generous, 10/10.
Â 
I absolutely loved the episode. Probably the strongest opening since EP1S1. LOVED IT.
221	Q the Cat	2014-04-07	9/10 for me.  Some of the best quotes were in this episode.  I loved Sandor and Arya.  And the red viper did not disappoint.
222	FaHaZe	2014-04-07	9/10
Â 
Loved it!!
Â 
The best "first episode" since season 1. Also, the best season opening scene since season 1.
Â 
I loved pretty much everything - Oberyn, Ellaria, Drogon answering back to his mother, Ser Dontos, Queen Arya. I even liked Jon Snow in this episode.
Â 
Can I just say season 4 Daario Naharis is like a million times better than the season 3 Daario? I actually found him...likeable for the first time. Huge improvement.
Â 
I wish they would have carried on with the foursome scene though. That was really hot. What a tease!
Â 
Shae is officially the most annoying character in the series. I just can't stand her. Her scenes are painful to watch. I miss Ros so much...
Â 
Can someone please tell me where was the dragon scene filmed? Such beautiful scenery. I wanna go there.
Â 
Also, I was a bit surprised that Dan Weiss directed this episode all by himself (!!). Well done, Mr Weiss, well done!! Â
223	King Tommen	2014-04-07	D&D actually directed the episode together, as they did for one episode last season. The director's guild only allows you to list one director so they alternated. Last season Benioff was listed and Weiss got his name on this one.
224	Gronzag	2014-04-07	Only thing i liked was the fight at the end
225	RenlyTheOneTrueKing	2014-04-07	10/10 
I hope the Hound got his chicken
226	Stormland's Fury	2014-04-07	I really hated Jon Snow on the show so far(and for the duration of the first tree books, but I loved him in this episode. He finally showed his flawed side, in a good way.
227	Ser Lady Stark Martell	2014-04-07	10/10. It felt like the episode had no more than 5 minutes, it went by so fast. Can't wait for 4x02!!
228	Stone Cold Bastard	2014-04-07	I gave it a 10. I loved it.
Â 
The intro with Ice was melancholic to the max. It was kind of like the final farewell to poor Ned. And the burning of the wolf pelt with a gloating Tywin - the symbolism was through the roof.
Â 
So much awesomeness: Jon Snow burning Slynt, Jaime standing up to Tywin, Oberyn making Lannister soldiers shit their pants, Sansa's grief and turmoil, the epic darkness and badassness of the Thenns, and of course the little killing spree by the Stark and the Hound, with Arya getting some sweet revenge. I was cheering.
Â 
The only aspect I didn't enjoy was the new Dario. So far the recasting blows. The previous actor was physically imposing, looked like a badass, walked and talked like a badass, exuded confidence and poise, and seemed so natural.
Â 
So far the new actor seems very timid and meek.

230	mynameiscrom	2014-04-07	I'm not sure if we watched the same show here on this forum. I found the episode to be cluttered, and an unruly exposition of plot lines. I could go my whole life without more homosexual activity on the show, but, HBO is very pc and ruining tv with this crap. Sansa's exchange with Dontos was lame, Joffery's exchange with Jaime was lame, dragon and new Daario were lame. This will be the worst season for GOT. I wish GRRM would quit TV and start writing!
231	rmholt	2014-04-07	9.5/10 Liked everything except the blue rose. Only one woman should have that, and her name is not Daenerys Targaryen.Â
232	gogorath	2014-04-07	Thought this was clearly the best of the Episode 1s.
Â 
I think they've learned something about introducing characters and establishing character arcs for the season. One thing that has been lacking for their writing is giving the audience some sense of where things are going -- the signals don't have to always be where you end up, but in a show like this, if you don't give the audience a sense of a character's arc as it starts, it seems meandering.
Â 
Here, in almost every storyline, they said "This is what this season is about" and did it both obviously and in a subtle manner. We know what Oberon's about. We know Jon's arc is about Mance lighting the biggest fire the nothing has ever seen (and about how some of the wildlings aren't as nice as Tormund). We know Dany's story will be about Meereen but also Daario.
Â 
We know Tyrion's trying to distance himself from Shae and what's going on with Jaime. We know what the Tyrells are up to. We know that Arya is heading to the Twins, but more importantly, she's heading down a path of revenge.
Â 
Some people will think of this as transparent, but when you spend only an hour with each character all season...it's just necessary. It's clarity and it creates tension and anticipation, rather than bewilderment.
Â 
And for the most part, it was elegantly done.
233	rmholt	2014-04-07	9.5/10 Liked everything except the blue rose. Only one woman should have that, and her name is not Daenerys Targaryen.

Sorry about the miscue
I saw the blue rose as a nod to an item seen in other GRRM works representing, I think, love. So she can't be even the only GRRM character with one.  I, personally, Squeee 'd over it. A castle made of sand with beetlish critters in the desert *might* have made me happier. Or an ice dragon in the backgound of a North of the Wall scene but that's just me. I wonder if that red flower will make into a skybox?

The show runners said they'd be thrown in jail if they showed some of the book sex scenes.  
The Dontos scene was nearly right out of the book. What was cut was the meetings she'd been having with him. Also instead of him ratting Sansa out to LF - ah I can't recall how that happened. Anyway the cover story for the necklace fit the books pretty well and gives her a reason to wear it - she is romantic and sentimental and kind - he's sposed to be at the wedding,
I found old Daario too much (as he should be) and I had JUST watched his intro ep. but just when I got used to him they threw in this more understated guy. But I'm getting to trust D & D.

My first thought but I'm quite troll-able
237	Lord of Winterhell	2014-04-07	I gave it an 8.
Â 
Few things I didn't like that much:
Â 
- Tyrion meeting Dornish guys in the middle of nowhere felt weird
- Brienne's scenes (she doesn't belong to KL at all)
- Dontos randomly returning (from the show POV, after being absent from S3)
- Olleana Tyrell - I don't share general opinion how funny she is
- Shae licking Tyrion's finger
Â 
What I loved:
Â 
- Jon was better than ever before, his best scene so far (or maybe its better to say Kit was better than ever before)
- Thenns were scary and Magnar was great (and I didn't mind their canibalism - changes like this make the show even more interesting to watch)
- Thorne (much better balanced than I remember him from the books, where he seemed like an ordinary villain)
- Ygritte/Tormund exchange
- Joffrey being Joffrey
- Sansa
- Dragons!
Â 
Oberyn was great. Tywin/Jamie scene felt weaker than I expected, but I guess it wasn't their last scene. I don't share common excitment from the Arya/Hound scene (somehow it seems to me that people are just happy that Arya and Hound kill some people), but it was obviously very good.
Â 
Overall great episode.
Â 
Two questions:
Â 
1. Can somebody remind me what were Cercei/Qyburn talking about (symptoms dialogue).
2. Does anybody have a clue how long it is possible to hold dagger/arakh/sword the way that GW/Dario did (for a strong man)?

Homophobia much?
239	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-07	A solid 8 outta 10. I just felt like it wasn't as intense as last season's premiere. But there's so many good lines in this episode it's easy to overlook the fact that it had barely any action scenes. It's setting up the season and introducing the characters; I'm sure the future episodes will make up for this one being a bit slow. Really enjoyed it overall.
240	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-07	2. Does anybody have a clue how long it is possible to hold dagger/arakh/sword the way that GW/Dario did (for a strong man)?


I have no idea, but I'd guess 20-30 minutes. Â If they bent their elbows a strong person could do it all day long, but straight out like that after 10 minutes a 4 pound blade is going to feel like 400.
241	Knight of the night	2014-04-07	Wow holy Efin wow 
From the opening sequence and the arrival of the martells and the hound and arya show , it was excellent. 
The sequence in the tavern between the hound and poliver and when arya drove the sword into his throat I had goosebumps . 
F the king
242	The Killer Snark	2014-04-07	StoneCold - They needed to point out the fact that Oberyn is bisexual, on account of not having the exposition on his character that comes from Tyrion in ASoS, because in the series it's in the brothel Oberyn gets introduced.
243	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-07	Â 
Homophobia much?


Â 
I'm actually surprised at the disapproval Oberyn being Bisexual has caused.Â 
Â 
It's so hypocritical, in the books you have Dany and Cersei kissing other woman and on the show you have lesbian whore scenes. However, the moment you have two guys at it people freak out.Â
244	Tyrion1991	2014-04-07	Arya had the best scenes. The money shot for this episode was when she finally got involved in the fight and shoved the longsword in his chest.
Â 
Dragons looked cool. Slightly soured by Jorah the walking prop showing up.
Â 
Jon facing the court and I loved that they brought back Janos Slynt. I was not expecting that. As well as the guy out of Stella. Good scene and a good part by Jon.
Â 
I like that Sansa met Ser Dontos. A little forced how it occurs, but I loved the expression on her face and it felt like it gave her some agency in accepting this guys gift.Â 
Â 
Jamie was great to see, wise cracking with Brienne, Tywin and Joffery. White book references were cool as well.Â 
Â 
Reforging ice was a great way to reintroduce the series.Â 
Â 
The dead child pointing at Meereen was really dark, especially with how in your face it was being up there crucified.Â 
Â 
Â 
Bad points
Â 
Azog...THE DEFILER
Â 
All the tyrell stuff. Unneccesary.
Â 
Oberyns introduction in the brothel.
Â 
Â 
Other things
Â 
I won't complain about the scene with Daario and Dany in of itself. I think Emilia Clarke actually shows quite a lot of nuance and the writing does address that what hes doing is corney but she says "you're a gambler" and she does talk shit to him but he persists. It works. But I dislike what this says about season 4 and the differences which have and are being made about the TV show.
Â 
Tyrion kind of fell flat for me which is odd. He felt more like a prop to introduce Oberyn and seemed so anxious in every scene it was off putting. Â 
Â 
Â
245	JyanaReed	2014-04-07	Wicked awesome, good job setting up the Sansa/Dontos amethyst plot and establishing the Martells. Casting for both Oberyn and Elleria is ON POINT. The scene in the tavern with the Hound and Arya is epic. My only complaint is that I am not into Daario 2.0. Everything else was pretty great.Â
246	rmholt	2014-04-07	10/10

Check the final bit. 
I was wondering how everyone knew PW was coming up ... Apparently I clicked off when the credits started running. Saw the previews on second viewing.
So since I watched it again I have to give it a 20.

I'm more towards a 10 out of 10 having watched it again.Â  My fave was when Arya complains that he isn't a thief, but he'll kill a kid and The Hound responds with, "Man's gotta have a code".Â  Ooooph.Â  I almost fainted.Â Â Â

248	Scrambled Aegon	2014-04-07	Rewatched and I'm giving it an 8.Â 
Other than NuDaario - which I don't count against this episode because it's not something specific to this one - I don't have any real complaints about this episode and it did have a lot of strong stuff. In particular: IÂ lovedÂ every single part of the introduction to Oberyn; the opening scene with Tywin was absolutelyÂ perfect;Â Sandor/Arya was fantastic; the Jaime/Cersei dialogue was remarkable; Kit and Janos's actor (whose name I don't know) were great. The melting down of ice and the introduction to Oberyn were without a doubt the best parts of the episode for me.
I'd give it, like, a 7.75 if I could.. but that rounds up to 8.

250	The Knight of Flours	2014-04-07	8/10 - can't expect much more than that for a season-opener.
251	Damazama21	2014-04-07	9/10 - Best premier since "Winter is Coming". I loved Arya's scene at the end, and all of Sansa's scenes. Tyrion was great as usual, and Oberyn is really weird. Dany's storyline was a bit boring (the dragons were awesome though!) but other than that the episode was really good. A promising start.
252	Nictarion	2014-04-07	Gave it an 8.

Oberyn has the right amount of swagger. I'm pretty much sold on him from 1 episode. 
Drogon looked amazing! 
Dunk reference. 
New Daario.
Arya and the Hound.
Con's
Sansa being chased through the Godswoods like a bad horror movie. 
Tyrion and Shae.

254	darksellsword	2014-04-08	I gave it a 5 .There were a few things I was shaking my head about. Oberyn sauntering into kings landing and basically
revealing his motivations like a bad scooby doo villain .He would be aware of what happened to Ned stark even with hundreds of
his personal guard he wouldn't be secure enough to be so openly belligerent..There are too many tell it like it is Characters not enough Characters that play their cards close to their chest.I thought the actor who played Oberyn was spot on just didn't like what he had to work with, I don't believe he would of confided in Tyrion.I don't know why no one in Westeros knows a song other than Rains of Castamere , They didn't need to have him stab
some random Lannister soldier in the wrist to understand that he is dangerous man and a great warrior.Talking of another great warrior, Loras Tyrell
its a shame D&D have continued to shit all over this Character he was never such a laughing stock in the books as they portrayed him as in the show,
now they have his own grandmother calling him a silly little boy and laughing at the idea of him being defeated by Brienne. That entire scene with Olenna,Margery and Brienne was so pointless and contrived. Is it just me or has Shae been moaning at Tyrion for 3 seasons now? Why would he
be in love with her she's hardly fun to be around.They dropped the ball with their portrayal of that relationship. Arya in the Tavern I thought her delivery
was a little off it was as if she were reading it from a piece of paper rather than actually mimicking what he had said to Lommy but that's the Directors fault entirely.The fenns, I loved the description one poster gave of them being like the bad guy from the Highlander movie .It was as if his instructions were to have as deep a voice as possible stand like a bad scifi movie villain and just look dangerous.The new Daario had all the screen presence of a wet blanket.
Positives, kit Harrington delivered one of his best performances .The hound was fantastic Â "what the fucks a Lommy" Is a line I will be laughing about for a while.The dragons looked incredible and the girl nailed to the post looked as gruesome as I had imagined it from the books..I don't buy Jaime not staying
true to his oath , They ruined his character,The whole episode was a little too slow overall.
255	rmholt	2014-04-08	To prove my total nerdliness I watched the preview in slo mo. Is that supposed to be Oberyn dueling the Mtn? That didn't look like a spear at all. The clanging.  I wonder if Tyrion's trial will be skipped altogether and PW blamed on Oberyn? Bc there just does not seem to be enough time if that preview was for next week . Tho who knows?? Maybe it's Jaime practicing with Ilyn Payne <G>
256	Uldra I	2014-04-08	10/10Â  Can't emphasize how much I loved this premier.Â  Great performances, amazing sets, and getting the important points from the books in.Â  Wow! Great Job!
Â 
The funnest thing to me is noticing what the tv scripts leave out from the books, and what they include.Â Â  I'm hooked on unraveling some of the many mysteries left in the books, and see what the show finds important to include and unimportant enough to omit helps me sift out some of the wheat from the chaff when it comes to the mysteries GRRM left us in the books.
Â 
Yeah, HBO!Â  Brilliant episode.
257	Jntam93	2014-04-08	I give it a solid 8/10
Seriously best premiere episode since season 1's "Winter is Coming".
Â 
Things I loved:
-Reforging of Ice. I was so angry reading what Tywin did to the stark's heirloom, seeing it added more fuel to that fire! 
-Jaime and Tywin's scene.
-Sansa.
-Arya and The Hound.
-Olenna Tyrell throwing the necklace (possibly the one Dontos gives Sansa for PW? Â )
-Oberyn and Ellaria's introduction.
-Drogon snapping at Daenerys.
Â 
Things I didn't like:
-Jon talking about how jealous he was of Robb.
-More Tyrion whitewashing.
-Dany and Daario because this is going to be torturous lol.
258	Normannen	2014-04-08	7.5, so rounded to 8.
Â 
I liked most of the King's Landing plot. Lena Hedley is just incredible as Cersei, as good as Joffrey, so good that I'm not sure who I dislike more. The Ser Boros, Brienne and Margaery parts were OK, and I absolutely loathe Shae. The forging of the swords were done overly theatrical for my taste.
Â 
The Oberyn Martell cast was brilliant. He's just as "suave" as I found him to be in the book (although a bit too muscly, but that is just nit-picking).
Â 
The Thenn introduction I did not like (and the "I fucking hate Thenns" I particularly didn't like), but I can see why they chose to merge the people og Skagos and Thenns (although not sure how this eventually will influence Rickon's storyline, if there ever is one). The rest of the Wall storyline were enjoyable.
Â 
The Daenerys in Mereen I quite liked, although not much happened. Watching the first dead child wearing a collar pointing towards excited me more than I thought it would, especially when she commented "remove their collars, and bury them" (I can't remember if the collars were mentioned in the book, but that was a nice touch). Should not be long until they arrive at Mereen then, with only 163 miles to go. Judging for the episode titles, it would seem that in episode 3 Mereen will be smashed.
Â 
The Arya and the Hound part was the best. I did remember missing The Tickler there, but having read here on the forums, apparently he died in series 2 (although I can't remember that particular scene). The fight was good, and Arya yelling at Polliver rather than The Tickler more than made up for it.

259	Black Wolf Smith	2014-04-08	I think you have to spilt the story lines.
Â 
Tywin's opening while a lot different from the books, was very good, made since from the shows POV of the character. 9/10
Â 
Tyrion/ OberynÂ  storylines while different from the books, worked really well, and stayed true to spirit of the story. 10/10
Â 
Arya and The Hound was damn near perfect, but isn't the Hound suppose to be wounded? 10/10
Â 
Jaime and BrienneÂ being there before the wedding sucks, but the did ok w/ those storylines (Â while BrienneÂ story will get back on track, I think they messed up a big part of Jaime's, theÂ guilt at not have the chance Â to talk to Joffery was something that weighed heavily on him, and at least part of the what came between him and Cersei, neither of which can be ever be fixed) I also think that Jaime not having being told that Cersei is just using him is really bad for the storylines. 6/10
Â 
Dany and the Slave cities is too rushed, focusing on the wrong things, and almost a have been better to skip those scenes, in favor of picking it backÂ up later inÂ the storyline. 6/10
Â 
8/10
260	Ran	2014-04-08	Over 480 votes in, and it's averaging 8.25. Removing the top and bottom 5% yields an 8.36. Median score remains 8, increasing its margin a bit since I last posted a summary.
261	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2014-04-08	Gave it a straight 8/10. I particularly enjoyed the last bit with Arya & the hound as well as Daenerys' sunbathing scene with drogon.

263	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-08	seven
264	Valar Morghulis Not Today	2014-04-08	I gave it a great solid 8. Â Love having the show back, and thought the pacing was a lot better than other openings - glad they've learned that we don't need to check in with everyone.
Â 
Particular liked:
The melting down of Ice hit me straight off.
The look on Tyrion's face when he was told it was Oberyn was attending the wedding.
Oberyn's whole involvement, glad that they mentioned Rhaegar.
Joff's whole scene, Jack Gleeson is incredible at playing him. Â Loved the mention of The Sword of Â the Morning and Dunk (though in the wrong order!)
Janos Slynt scoffing at the mention of giants, followed by an oh shit moment of realisation. Â (As well as Maester Aemon's ability to hear the truth).
Basically everything with The Hound/Arya and Polliver(/Raff). Â "What the f***s a Lommy?", the Hound having to eat all of the chickens, "Can you walk boy", "I'll have to carry you", "Fine little blade, I think I'll pick my teeth with it". (Would have liked questions about the brotherhood, gold in the village etc but what they did do was awesome).
God those dragons are getting big.
A blue rose!!!
Wasn't overly keen on:
Jon & Sam's interaction.
Thenns, not how I'd imagined them.
Shae & Tyrion's scene
The way they have changed the timing of something which has led to a little unnecessary awkwardness - but can see why they wanted it.
Not keen on new Dhario, and don't think Dany's character is developing quite enough, would like more response from her - though I get that her scenes this week were to introduce new Dhario.
Looking forward to next week.
265	BlackTalon	2014-04-08	Which happened over a year ago and she has no real practice with. You don't know this, but swords are heavy, and little Arya has not had any practice with real blades.


Â 
Would you care to explain why you think "I don't know this"??? You seriously believe you're the only person in the world who has ever held a sword...?
Â 
Look at the books again and you will find that the practice swords actually had lead cores to make them heavier. A girl her age would have no problems handling a real sword, especially not with a two handed grip like Arya is doing.

268	BlackTalon	2014-04-08	It's half right. IIRC Jon admitted Robb was better with the lance on horseback, but Jon was better with the sword, which of course is more important in the Night's Watch.
269	Greywolf2375	2014-04-08	I'm floating between a 7-8.
Â 
The ep started well, but as others have said I would have liked to have seen the magic/difficulty in melting down Ice.Â  It is a small thing, but would I think would have been impactful from the standpoint that yes, the Lannisters won that war but it isn't as over as they want it to be.Â 
Â 
It ended well - The Hound was great, Arya was good but went a little too dark a little too quickly for me.
Â 
The Joffrey/Jaime/White book scene was great - just want to reach into the TV and beat Joffrey with a stick.
Â 
Some of the downsides are the shift in Jaime/Brienne being in town this early, still missing out on Loras not in the KG and the interaction with Brienne.Â  I thought bringing Dontos back like this was very awkward.Â  While I liked the introduction to Oberyn, it was a little too much with him reacting like that to Rains.Â  Not that it gets sung a lot in Dorne, but does really react like that each time someone brings up the Lannisters or sings the song?
Â 
Overall the episode probably is the strongest opener for me since s1ep1.
270	Miss Carnahan	2014-04-08	4/10
Â 
Hated Oberyn's introduction (there's more about the character than his bisexuality), they made Arya even weirder (and sadistic) and I still don't like the fact that they brought Jaime and Brienne to KL earlier than in the book. + Emilia's acting skills were not to be found again, I assume? (and when will they finally do some about those eyebrows??)
On a sidenote, Jack was yet again perfect as Joffrey! He never fails to amuse me.
271	Lies And Perfidy	2014-04-08	Yeah I'm on the 8 bandwagon. Shameless self-promotion alert: here's my recap & analysis on Dorkadia Dot Com.
272	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-08	Hated Oberyn's introduction (there's more about the character than his bisexuality)


Not to jump all over you, but Oberyn's introduction lasted for 7+ minutes and only about 50 seconds of it was spent on his bisexuality. Â Is that really the only think you took away from it?
Â 
Â

The lack of subtlety, same as with Loras and Renly, was what peeved me.


Â 
Well, perhaps we could wish for more subtlety from the TV show when it comes to sex and sexuality, but if the heterosexual lust is going to be dealt with so heavy-handedly (unsubtly!) then it only seems right to have bisexual or homosexual lusts of all shades dealt with in a similar heavy-handed way. Â Â 
Â 
Maybe the peeving lack of subtlety you mention for male-male attraction is occasioned by how elided these relationships are in the books? Â Back in 1996, when Loras/Renly was almost entirely "between the lines", Martin had a reserve for the subject that was typical for that era. Â  But Martin, to his credit, has evolved slightly. Â Oberyn by 2000 was actively speaking of his attraction (though we were not given a sex scene), and finally, by 2011, Jon Connington could ponder his longing for Rhaegar from a Point of View voice. Â  Still, Martin doesn't like to write male-male homosexual sex scenes as much as he seems to enjoy female-female ones, or male-female ones - not really very surprising that this should be so. Â  Seems to me, as the story goes on, and when appropriate for specific characters, Martin should be willing to be LESS subtle with male-male sex - if only to match the spirit of "unflinching realism" that otherwise pervades his narrative.
Â 
My two cents.
274	The Killer Snark	2014-04-08	Edmund the Just - My own personal belief is that, regarding our beloved khaleesi Dany Stormborn, the creators are keeping her eyebrows big on purpose, because the feral nature of her dragons has been brought in early, and if they now start to fly away and do their own thing frying cows and stuff, she can always call them back by using some furry eyebrow semaphore. Perhaps her pets will think they are baby dragons dancing with one another from their lofty distance, and this will call them back to her until it's time they went fully dangerous. Perhaps they intend for us to call Dany 'Mother of Eyebrows' in order to add to Martin's list of her names.

275	clairep12	2014-04-08	I really enjoyed this episode, I gave it an 8/10. I loved arya and the hound together, i especially enjoyed how she ended up with her own horse at the end of the episode after the hound telling her she couldnt have one at the start. I am definitely intrigued to see what they do with the rest of the season.

It is rumored that Sean Bean makes an appearance, maybe when Bran touches a tree. With them mentioning Arthur Dayne, mentioning Lyanna from Oberyn, and the blue rose, I think maybe we get Tower of Joy this year,

279	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-04-08	I didn't know, but rotten tomatoes is rating game of thrones episodes. EP1 is currently at 96%!
280	Lord_Baelish	2014-04-09	I gave it a 9/10 rating. I don't like the new Daario, and Dany got on my nerves, but I loved everything else about the episode. Jon facing down Slynt, Arya and the Hound against the world, Oberyn's introduction - I felt all of it was really well done. The writing has for the most part been impressive and I really hope that continues for the rest of the season.
281	Kenyatta	2014-04-09	I gave it a 7. I'm sorry but the welcoming of the Dornish to Kings Landing was lacking. The Dornish should have come in with all the pomp and circumstance that the book says the do, minus Doran of course. Oberyn is lacking. I feel like I could kick this Red Viper's ass on a good day...not impressed, and the feeling I got from the books was that Oberyn Martell was impressive to look at.
Â 
Loved the fact that we're going to see the Sir Dontos - Sansa story line. I was beginning to think they were going to cut it out when we got Littlefinger - Sansa last season.
Â 
I am officially Team Hound. He may be a despicable creature, but so help me God I do love him so. His lines this episode are quote worthy for many years to come.
Â 
For those Unsullied I think seeing the scene with Arya v. Pulliver gives them hope that revenge will be served. Arya is a straight up bad ass. And I look forward to the upcoming scenes with her and the Hound. He obviously has some respect for her because he let her have a horse...a white one at that, and he let her keep Needle.
Â 
I'm done with Shae. She was annoying in the books, and even more annoying on the small screen. I see where they are going with her being jealous and her finally calling Tyrion her "Lion".Â 
Â 
Good to see Janos Slynt again. He's been gone for awhile so I was afraid they might cast someone different in the role. Good times are ahead indeed.
Â 
The Thenns were overplayed. I envisioned the Magnor of Thenn being like Tormund Giantsbane...only bigger and dumber. These guys are like Hellraiser.....if Hellraiser had a nightmare and they were in it. I guess the wedding is out.
Â 
All in all....not great. But not awful.

Â 
The scenes themselves are not the issue.
Â 
In the books the rumours of Renly is done by whispers. I wasn't even sure it was true until Martin himself confirmed it. I might not be the most attentive reader, but even still. That's quite a leap to where he almost openly flaunts his desires.
Â 
Taking Jon Connington's admiration for Rhaegar for anything more than that, admiration, is quite a leap as well, and the first time I've heard of this mentioned.

					
					
							Edited by Normannen, 09 April 2014 - 06:42 AM.
283	The Killer Snark	2014-04-09	Martin himself admitted JonCon is gay, and he said one of his new POVs would be a gay character before the publication of ADwD. The clues are not that obvious, but you can spot them. At one point the secret passage to the brothel is mentioned as rumoured to be built in order to cover the sexual predilections of the Hand before Eddard. JonCon admires Rhaegar in the way that a young girl would, remembering his physical gracefulness and the way the wind moved through his flowing locks of hair.
284	NaarioDaharis	2014-04-09	And to further your point real, broadswords are really sharp, meant to kill people, and replicas are not.Â 


Â 
They are really sharp, but armor exists for a reason.
Â 
Swords are not as sharp as movies would have you believe, and they were not used to deflect other blades. That is the point of a shield. People block with blades in movies because the clanging sound is cool for the audience to hear. Swords would break if they were swung against each other like that all the time.
Â 
You can love the fight scene if you want. I don't. Broadswords are heavy for 10 year old girls and it does take muscle to push through leather and mail and steel (though leather is not real armor, it just looks cool in shows).

well, to be fair, it's only implied in the books because neither Loras nor Renly are POV characters, therefore the only way for it to be confirmed would've been to have a POV stumble across one of their sexytimes, which would be just plain weird. I don't think it was Martin being shy really, you'd have to be blind not to see they were lovers.

289	theriveryeti	2014-04-09	Am I the only one so far that DOESN'T like new Daario? I see people saying they like him. I really don't so far. I know it's early, but he's not arrogant enough, and he's missing that edge, that cocky swagger, the smirk, the walk. I don't know. I just don't know.


Â 
Â 
Yeah, the new one doesn't seem douchey enough.
290	Shebara	2014-04-09	Â 
Â 
Yeah, the new one doesn't seem douchey enough.


Â 
I gave the episode an 8..but yes that is quite the word for the new Daario...good looking guy but not douchey enough, the old Daario was perfect! 
Â 
On the other hand I really liked the episode: already the beginning, the forging of the 2 swords from Ice, I liked the "cute" dragons  , the Brienne scenes with Jaime and Olenna, pitied poor Dontos, laughed about the statue/Joffrey scene. Best was the Arya/Polliver scene..what an actor Maisie is, when she is showing the pleasure she is taking in this revenge...mercy?..no mercy!
291	Aegor Targaryen	2014-04-09	Loved the introduction of Oberyn!
292	Dildo_Baggins	2014-04-09	You know, talking ie. exposition is a hell of a lot less interesting than showing.
What exactly would suffice for you to show fighting skill? I thought it was pretty slick how quickly he drew that dagger and incapacitated that Lannister clown.


Â Spot on
293	Lord Spark of House Spark	2014-04-09	I think the Thenns introduction seemed a bit clunky, and I thought that there should have been more subtlety in the Dornish plot as well. I can't see Book Oberyn standing in a back alley to bring up the subject of his dead sister, and the brothel scene was just one step down from them wearing big signs round their necks saying WE SWING BOTH WAYS.
They dont seem to give the audience any credit for being able to work things out for themselves.
Â 
The Mercy line was set up and delivered a Squillion times better in the newly released chapter. it makes me wonder if that was why GRRM released it. As if to say " look what they did with my line"
294	Nordeast	2014-04-09	I would of liked a walk and Talk where Tyrion talks to Bronn about the Red Vipers across the narrow seas adventures. Â I always thought he had the coolest back story. Â Learning poisons, fighting with the second sons, etc.

The Excellent:
Â 
Arya and the Hound
Oberyn and Tyrion's Elia chat
Jon's sentencing hearing. Everyone was excellent all through that scene, especially Thorne.
The Thenn's presence/music/attitude. Loved the warg reference.
Ice reforging
Dragon's graphics
Ellaria Sand- Finally there is an epic beauty in an epic series! She is such a good actress and I hope they giver her some actual lines
Tormund + Ygritte scene
Â 
Â 
The Horrible:
Â 
Every sentence Dany uttered so stiffly. The sword contest was stupid. The flowers were too (I don't care about the symbolism)
Tyrion + Shae two scenes
"Robb was better than me at everything" blunder that was compounded with Sam saying to Jon, " Sometimes I hate you too".
"Did you let him touch you?" blunder from Jaime to Cersei. That was compounded by ," You took too long". So Cersei is giving Jaime hints that she sleeps around?
Lady Olenna necklace scene
Thenn's cannibalism
Weepy Sansa in one scene and then smiley Sansa in the next. The acting was good but it was from one extreme to the other.
Sexy!!! brothel scene with Oberyn was silly. The stabbing was silly.
Tyrion's greeting party scene was a bit lacking. I think it was quickly and cheaply done to segue into the sexy!!!! scene.
296	Ladybird075	2014-04-10	This is my first time posting to the forum. I've been just hanging out for the last few months, so hello. I thought the premiere was great given how much material they had to cover. 
I really liked the scene with Oberyn and Elleria. Yeah, it was way over the top but that's how those Dornish people roll. 
I loved the humor in this Episode too. I chuckled through the entire show, especially during the scenes with Bronn. 
I  loved the Lannister scenes in this one...the conversations between Twin and Jaime and Jaime and Cersei were great and show that even though they are THE most powerful family in Westeros there are definite cracks in that foundation.
The scene between Margaery and Brianne was awkward and seemed out of place in this episode, but I'm sure the writers are setting up for something.
Lastly, what happens with the Hound and Arya at the end of the episode more than made up for any shortcomings this episode had. That was just the sweetest revenge scene... and so brutal. I gave this one an 8 out of 10. 
Sundays can't get here fast enough!
297	sprongi of meatball	2014-04-10	Easily the best premiere so far though.
Best bits
1. Tywin reforges Ice

'And what better way to question her than naked, with her legs well spread?' the dwarf whispered. 'That's how I like to question her too.'
299	Fevre River Warrior	2014-04-10	It think this episode was great, and like it more each time I view it. I love the Hound, Bronn continues to have great lines, and am glad to see the Dontos story line reintroduced. The dragons were fantastic! I don't think the new Dario is as good as the old. I can't see why Dany would be drawn to him, the old Dario I could see. The Thenns were scary and so unlike the book - I guess the wedding with Alyce is out of the HBO story. Too bad, I like that part of the book.
Â 
Great job once again, I am glued for the next nine weeks....and longer.
300	Ser Ilyn's Tongue	2014-04-10	Really great episode. Â I definitely preferred it to the openers of series 2 and 3. Â I'm giving it an 8 in the hope that the series will still get better from here.
301	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-04-11	There were some highs and lows. Even though I knew what was coming with the forging of oathkeeper and widows wail, seeing it still pissed me off and Tywin burning the scabbard in the flames just reinforced how much I hate him, Charles dance is perfect as Ty, and oberyn is so badass I loved him in the books but that seen with the lannister soldier singing reins was awesome, but the arya scene will good just doesn't hold a candle to the one in asos. Solid episode.
302	XTwipz	2014-04-11	I voted 8/10. This episode opens some new plotlines that can bring a new breath to the serie. Great ! looking foward next episode !
303	mimsy187	2014-04-11	I gave it 5. Why? 1) Darrio & Dany. I have read the books and my boyfriend has not. Even he was thrown off by the way this new guy is portraying the character Daario! 2) Jaime & Brienne. I felt like the writers should have written their arrival to the castle differently. I say this mostly because Brienne didn't have any real introduction at all, and yet she ended up in the gardens with the Tyrells. What?? 3) Overall writing of the episode. It didn't feel like a "first episode". It was "choppy" (for lack of a better word). The scenes didn't flow. My boyfriend and I both just looked at each other after it ended with cocked eyebrows and had a lengthy discussion about how we felt awkward after watching it. lol With that said, I do think the episode had some really great moments, and I know things will straighten out as the season continues, but what an odd way to script a season opener!Â 
EDIT: On the note of the Daario/Dany scenes: They seemed rushed and somewhat out of place, like they were thrown into the episode as an afterthought. On a positive note, I absolutely LOVE the portrayal of Maester Aemon!Â

304	Oldgodsnewtricks	2014-04-11	In some ways, Arya's killing of Poliver in the S4 premier has more in common with her killing of Raff the Sweetling in the recently released Mercy chapter than it does with anything in the source chapter from ASOS (e.g., her revealing her identity to him through references to his earlier murder of her friend, her cooly inserting the sword through the throat). Â Is it possible Martin put the WoW chapter out there just ahead of the premier airing just so there would be no mistake about which scene was written first and by whom... ?

309	starlight5	2014-04-11	I loved it, and love that HBO keeps rerunning it. Â With watching all the run-up episodes to this Season 4, I am impressed at how far-seeing the show runners were -- many things from season 1 are tied in, this far down the line.
Â 
I do, however, want very much to own a t-shirt with The Hound's visage and the words, "A man's gotta have a code. . . " (not sure if those were exact words, but close enough). Â 
Â 
Counting down till Sunday night and episode 2, torn between wearing my Ghost Pale Ale shirt and dressing completely in purple. Â Anyway, I thought the story lines were all good, didn't register much of the Red Viper in the books but what an impact on the show. The Breinne/Jaimie interlude was understated but spot-on; Â Sansa is finally heading in a tolerable direction, Shae is finally heading in her direction of doom, and Dany is finally getting the hint that ruling is more than standing around proclaiming all your titles--not to mention that parenthood ain't always easy.

THe only real action here was the fight at the Inn... and a bloody good show it was!
But the adulation over Arya turning into a wanton, heartless killer, I just don't get it. Seems to be the most common fate for anyone still alive in Westeros, to tell you the truth.

Maybe.

But the adulation over Arya turning into a wanton, heartless killer, I just don't get it.Â 


Â 
Â 
Something really seems to have missed the mark here. After so many people wanting to see a Stark, and Arya in particular, start to fight back, when it happens they appear to get put off by it.
Â 
A podcast I follow had the same reaction. The season preview episode lamented the amount of time before 'Arya finally strikes back - it has been hinted for 3 seasons now. They need to make it happen"

If we're talking about the same podcast: the "non-reader host" was complaining about the triumphant music, but the "reader host" disagreed with him. I kind of agree that the music was a touch too triumphant, when viewed in isolation, but in the scene as a whole I think it was pretty clear that we weren't supposed to view Arya's turn as 100% a good thing.
Â 
Personally, I thought Arya throughout that scene was brilliant. You're half cheering for what she's doing, and you're half mournful about the tragedy of her becoming a child assassin. I loved too the contrast between her fighting style and the Hound's - he's all grubby and in the dirt and not the least bit graceful, whereas Arya's trying to be an artist with moves more reminiscent of dance than combat. She's trying to make killing a work of art, which in a way makes it even more profoundly disturbing.
317	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-13	Yep, it would be the same podcast.Â 
Â 
The opportunity was missed to point out that the music morphs from the GoT theme into the Jaqen H'ghar theme as the credits roll.

To be honest I am not one to pay attention to the score very often... but Chen is right on to it (normally) and has taught me to appreciate it. Its striking though, that the previous week he was bemoaning the lack of Ayra action, then once it happened he jumped straight to a discussion of the score, but completely missed what had really been done with the music.

That's how Maisie sees it too. I'm holding out hope she isn't really evil at the core (and she shouldn't be with her psychological background) but just has a touch of PTSD and is in total survival mode.
Having Reek escape again seems superfluous. BTDT.

322	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-04-13	Haven't been around for ages (forgot my password yet again - so sorry, Elio!), Â I gave this a 9. Â Probably the best Premier since Season 1. Â I don't have many complaints, but I took a point off for clunky scenes: 1) Brienne meeting the Tyrell girls - WTF? Â 2) Emilia, after 4 years, has got no better at all! Â That recoil she did from Drogon's attack was the best acting she's done since Day One.
Â 
I wasn't bothered by new Daario, folks. Â I hated him in the books, so I'm not invested in him and couldn't really care less who plays him. Â But at least this new guy can act a bit.
Â 
Same with the Thenns for me. Â Just another wildling group - they all started to blend into one in the books for me, but I thought the Magnar was well played.
Â 
Oberyn and The Hound stole this one for me.
Â 
And now I've got the wine in for Episode 2. Â Must toast the wedding of King Joffrey of the House Baratheon, First of his Name.

Â 
Good answer to my being critical... better than most, anyway.
Â 
But hang on just a sec here.
I remember Arya's first kill way back at King's Landing. That was perfect; sudden and shocking to Arya. The time she killed that little crew of loud-mouths after the Red Wedding was nicely done as well.
Â 
However, this time, bot the men she kiled were already on the floor, she was basically being a Jakal following the Hound around and picking up his scraps.
That bothered me about as much as how much she enjoys killing now.

326	Jon Black	2014-04-14	I'm a bit late with this comment but I'm just not sure how folks rate the season opener as they would any other episode. Â Given the demands (setting up the stories, making introductions, etc.), I always have to rate the opener as the opener. Â It has to be viewed thru that lens, IMHO.
Â 
With that said, 9.

330	Count Balerion	2014-04-19	Perhaps this episode really merits a 7; but I'm so glad the season started up that I gave it an 8 anyway.Â  The best parts, as is not uncommon, involved the Lannisters, especially Jaime.Â  Sansa was decent; she's more open with Tyrion than in the books, but also has more of an attitude.Â  I like the bit with the Hound and Arya at the end.
What had me scratching my head was the bit with Grey Worm and Daario.Â  What the?Â  I wasn't sure what was going on with the wildlings, either.

332	Smackdrenaline_GOT	2014-04-24	The valyrian sword scene was epic. Branding down Ned Stark's Sword of the First Men was insane. How it was made and then given in vain to Both
"Gold Hand" Kingslayer and Joffrey upset me when they got them. But the ritual done by Lord Tywin was like ending the reign in the north.Â 
Â 
That to me, opens a lot of doors in the great war that is coming.Â 
Â 
The introduction of OBeryn to the pinkmen (past the bi scene) was crazy too. i really like how he just came and arrived in king's landing and not formally
introduced to tyrion and the future exchange between the two was epic.Â 
Â 
it shows that the sins of the lannisters are once again haunts tyrion, now that he is only master of coin and not hand of the king.

What made that scene even better is knowing Joffrey is insulting his father, who just gave up Casterly Rock to "protect him."Â

350	A Murder of Ravens	2014-04-08	Like the episode aside from the actor switcheroo for Daario Naharis' character. Subsequently this is really pissing me off.
Â 
Why didn't they just kill him off and introduce a new character. I read somewhere that the switch from Ed Skrein to Michiel Huisman has more to do with Dany's character who falls for the sellsword who is more complex. Perhaps this change from the books to the television series and then a mid-series rewrite caused me to not like the choices D&D have made regarding this character. I liked Skrein's Naharis though-- he had an edge to him. He was dangerous.Â
351	Khal Porno	2014-04-09	I think the new actor is quite a bit better than the previous one playing Daario.Â  He was really good on the show Nashville and I thought he did an excellent job in the first episode of Game of Thrones.Â  I'm looking forward to seeing what he does with the character.
352	elmis	2014-04-10	I instantly took a disliking to the new Daario, mainly because he played that douche Sonny on Treme.
353	Laguna	2014-04-10	I instantly took a disliking to the new Daario, mainly because he played that douche Sonny on Treme.


Â 
I stopped watching Treme because of him. Couldn't stand that guy anymore. In 4.1 he was okay for me though. Don't love him, don't hate him. I'm sure he's not a bad actor. We just have to wait I guess.
Â 
Ed Skrein's version had a certain arrogance/swagger that didn't make him very likable, but at least he was kindaÂ cool.
354	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-04-11	I think the reason they changed Daarios is because Skrein will be in the Transporter prequel
355	Lady cut throat	2014-04-11	The Thenns were brilliant and really sinister. Different from the books I know (they're not cannibals for one) but I think they did that to show how much more dangerous they are compared to the wildlings.

Â 
Each season seems to start off slowly, and build towards a climax in the 9th episode.Â  I anticipate the first few episodes will mostly be uneventful, to build up the suspense.
Â 
I suspect the necklace that the fat guy gave to Sansa will be important to the plot, but not sure how.

360	aameen	2014-04-07	I wonder what this means. D&D wouldn't put such a particular thing in for no reason. But they haven't shown Lyanna at all. they had a Wall at the end of season 2 but refused to put a blue rose there. So, they've declined the connection till now.Â 
If we assume that they've started to develop that motif, what does the curing thing mean? Could it be a huge symbol forÂ Jon getting Dany pregnant later on? As in 'curing' her of her barren-ness?
361	Envie	2014-04-07	That's a pretty far stretch to equate that to Jon or anything that far in the future...
Â 
Also, he said it can "Cure a fever" not inability to get pregnant.
Â 
I do think the inclusion of the "dusk rose" was a definite nod to book readers and possibly the other two flowers though I'm sure there's going to be hundreds of interpretations (or misinterpretations). They love to do that and it's great fun for book fans.
Â 
Edit: Also, if you remember from Lyanna's lore (and the usual symbolism of the blue rose) - she died of a fever in a "Bed of blood." so that may be the reference to curing a fever but even that's more mystery than answers!

Â 
The fact that the "dusk rose" was blue could just be propmaster shenanigans. "Dusk" sounds like more of a purplish colour, really.
Â 
The idea that the rose cured fever did remind of Lyanna's death, since she supposedly was suffering of fever when she died.
Â 
..."Dusk rose" first made me think of the "dusky woman," now that I think of it.

363	mister_white_walker	2014-04-07	Well on top of that Oberyn did mention Lyanna vaguely in his aside with Tyrion. Â Not specifically at all, but enough that any further elaboration could bring up the subject easily. Â Might be that now that they Â know Â most of the ending for sure, they may be starting to reference smaller details like that to prepare the show to bring them up effectively in these next three or so seasons the show has left.
Â 
Not enough of an indication to suggest that this is the case, but not too far from possible.

365	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-07	When he offered the rose and it was blue I left the room screaming. I missed the other flowers stuff. Somewhere here said that the white flower was "Lady's lace"?

Â 

Â 
Okay... I've been reading through the thread and saw some speculation about the symbolism of Daario's flowers.
Â 
An alternative to the dragon head theory is that they could be referencing Little finger's three queens (two of the flower names have obvious female connotations: 'lady's lace' and 'harpy's gold'). Â If they are referencing the queens then the 'dusky' rose would obviously be Sansa (or possibly Arya), Harpy's gold is for Cersei, and Lady's lace is probably Margaery.
Â 
I can't help but also notice that both Sansa and Margaery had scenes involving getting a necklace while Cersei (the only one who isÂ alreadyÂ a queen) was wearing her big gold lion.
Â 
That's all I've got. Â It was super weird to see Daario suddenly producing a blue rose. Â It seemed like heavy handed, enigmatic symbolism of some sort.

Â 


Â 
Well see that's the point I maybe failed to make. The fact that he makes a point of saying the dusk rose is known to 'cure a fever' which is exactly what killed Lyanna (and her favorite flower could have saved her life) makes the irony and sadness of the story all that more poignant.Â 
Â 
Also, things are likely named much differently on that side of the world than in Westeros so calling it a dusk rose instead of a winter blue rose is not that unusual.

372	setmyheartafire	2014-04-07	My blue rose post from the epi thread.
Lots of spoilers here about the blue rose.
For those who were wondering... The blue winter rose is grown in the glass gardens at Winterfell. It was Lyanna Stark's favorite flower, apparently. At a tournament at Harrenhall, Rhaegar Targaryen wins and shocks everyone when he crowns Lyanna, not his wife Elia, the Queen of Love and Beauty with a crown of blue roses. 
In Ned's dreams, narration, etc., he recalls Lyanna with blue roses. 
Daenerys sees a blue flower growing from a chink in a wall of ice, spreading its sweetness around, in her visions at the House of the Undying in the book. 
Theon Greyjoy later has a dream about the dead in the crypts of Winterfell which includes a woman in a gore spattered white gown and a crown or "laurel" of blue winter roses that Theon deduces is Lyanna.
People have theorized that Lyanna didn't exactly die in childbirth (even if R + L = J), but from a fever. So this mention of the "dusk rose" being used for fever is great for theorizing too. 
It is always possible that the dusk rose was brought over to Westeros and cultivated in the north in glass gardens, eventually becoming the blue winter rose of the north  .
373	Sun	2014-04-07	My interpretation (utter bollocks ofcourse, so take it as such):
Â 
Dany is the fever that will hit Westeros (Fire and blood), Jon (the blue rose / Ice & fire) is the antidote that will rid the continent of her disease (the dragons).Â 

					
					
							Edited by Sun, 07 April 2014 - 06:33 AM.
374	MoIaF	2014-04-07	I think it's a clear nod to the vision Dany sees in the HOTU.
Â 
Everything she saw in HOTU (Daughter of Death, Slayer of Lies, & Bride of Fire)Â  relates to Dany, whether is a Dnay/Jon endgame or Dany finally finding family (non romantic) it has to do with her.
Â 
Even though in the books the rose is from the North of Westeros, the fact that they decided to to make it Essosi )or Essosi as well as Westerosi) in the show, signal at least to me that the symbolism of the rose will be important to Dany.

375	AnotherCrannogman	2014-04-07	Well, if Daario is Benjen it explains why the show will not need Coldhands.Â  I think Benjen plays a role and if he does that from the Daario role then he need not do it as Coldhands.
376	H Reed	2014-04-07	If the third flower is red and gold - and poisonous, are we looking for a rotten Lannister for the third head, and might one appear in the next few weeks?
377	Logodnica	2014-04-07	Ok there were 3 Lyanna/Raegahr/Elia references in ONE SINGLE EPISODE, after 3 seasons when this has been barely alluded to.Â  That was not an accident.Â  It seems like they are now shoving this story onto the viewers.
Â 
(1) The blue rose - a favorite of Lyanna's
(2) The actual explanation by Oberyn
(3) And rifling through the book of the Kingsguard.Â  When they got to Arthur Dayne I was holding my breath wondering if they'll mention "The Tower of Joy."Â 
Â 
Who knows what sorts of things Jamie will find in the show by rifling through that book!!Â  Oh gee I wonder why the Kingsguard was guarding this ONE TOWER and not their boy king Viserys who fled to Dragonstone.Â  Hmmmm...

Edit: Also, if you remember from Lyanna's lore (and the usual symbolism of the blue rose) - she died of a fever in a "Bed of blood." so that may be the reference to curing a fever but even that's more mystery than answers!

Â 
I think the rose/mention of curing a fever was definitely more of a nod to book readers than anything else. Lyanna liked "blue winter roses," so it's unlikely the glass gardens of Winterfell used "dusk roses" from deserts in Slaver's Bay. Mayhaps though...
Â 
I also think we need to be careful not to misinterpret or apply too much meaning to it. D&D may have wanted to at least give subtle winks to R+L=J, but I doubt they were introducing us to the "3 heads of the dragon" or foreshadowing Jon curing a fever Dany will get or something. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but if I'm going to over-analyze something, I'd rather focus on Martin's text, not the show.

379	RhaenysBalerion	2014-04-07	I wonder what this means. D&D wouldn't put such a particular thing in for no reason. But they haven't shown Lyanna at all. they had a Wall at the end of season 2 but refused to put a blue rose there. So, they've declined the connection till now.Â 
If we assume that they've started to develop that motif, what does the curing thing mean? Could it be a huge symbol forÂ Jon getting Dany pregnant later on? As in 'curing' her of her barren-ness?


Â 
Oh I was really happy with all the Rhaegar/Lyanna/Elia references. But the only thing it made me wonder about whether we might get a flashback this season or next. After all, the Rhaegar/Lyanna/Elia back story keeps popping up throughout the books, thus must be of relevance, yet it hasn't been mentioned, let alone shown on the show much so far. We are at season 4 after all, and if something plot relevant actually evolves out of the whole Rhaegar/Lyanna/Jon business, it's time they started adding it drop by drop to the show as well. And so I think the blue rose means nothing more than an element of building up the Rhaegar/Lyanna motif and symbol system.
Â 
I think, to associate the blue rose with Jon in the first place, we should know for a fact that Jon is Lyanna's son, which we do not know for a fact. Thus I have the impression that considering the blue rose a symbol of Jon getting Daenerys pregnant is a little bit far fetched.Â 
Â 
Daario being Rhaegar or Benjen... Daario is just Daario.Â
380	ViennaGirl	2014-04-07	I'm laughing - only insane book readers (everyone on this board including myself) left last night's episode saying, yup, that episode was ALL about Lyanna Stark.Â 
Â 
And I don't care that he called it a "dusk rose," and people think dusk is purple - that flower was blue as the jewels Dontos gave Sansa  That was a BLUE ROSE. I'm still having a nerd attack over it.
381	g.o.d	2014-04-07	I wonder if the TPTB are finally starting to deal with Rhaegar and Lyanna
382	hhh	2014-04-07	I thought maybe the episode was aiming to establish a subliminal symbolic link between the blue rose and Rhaegar's identity? Of course it's very faint but Oberyn's description of Rhaegar Targaryen coupled with Dany seeing the blue rose as a source of comfort could set up a path to associating the flower with Rhaegar's Targ heritage and later more specifically with R+L if they make sure to consistently repeat the rose motif throughout coming episodes. Anyway it was awesome
383	Chebyshov	2014-04-07	I really don't see how anyone could draw a connection between Daario handing Dany the rose and Rhaegar. Like, to book readers, sure. But I think they just need to start peppering in these subtle notes more and more. However, on its own, all it did was make book readers' heads explode.

391	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-07	OMG, it was just soooÂ blue!Â  
Â 
However, I don't know how the 'curing fever' trait refers to Lyanna- she most likely died of a fever so that's pretty back to front symbolism.
Â 
Red flower (poison)- Lannisters (Joff's death and maybe Tommen poisoned by Cersie as red is a lannister colour)
Blue Rose (cures fever)- Jon will 'cure' the realm or he may be suffering from fever after his injuries in Dance.Â 
Â 
or they may be referring to the 3 dragon heads- red flower and poison is (F)Aegon, blue rose is Jon (R+L=J) and White flower is Dany (silver queen).Â 
Â 
Or (my personal belief) they represent something in Dany's character and arc- Cures things (she likes to help people e.g. slaves), poison (she is deadly and is growing corrupt) and white flower (she is beautiful and to a degree was once innocent but has since blossomed).Â 
Â 
or maybe I'll leave this to the experts.Â

I've thought about that before, but obviously her mother giving birth to her on a ship was well known
400	fangirl000	2014-04-07	I think the writers were setting up the story for when the Pale Mare hits Meereen.
Â 
I do think the writers are going to completely introduce R+L = J as a theory this year (not confirm or deny, just introduce). Â But The events in Meereen are Dany's arch for this season, so it makes sense to use the flowers more directly with that part of her story. Â Daario even makes a point of telling Dany that she needs to know the land in order to rule her people. Â Now Dany knows that when a fever hits her people, she needs to find blue roses.Â

402	Mrs.Grumpy	2014-04-07	I must admit that it made me a little bit angry that they didn't call it winter rose, but different cultures different names, you know. I really like the theory that Lyanna had those roses with her in the Tower of Joy because she had a fever.
Â 
I knew that there was a flower named Harpy's Gold around that area, it's even mentioned in the books (geek alarm!), and I really wanted him to say one of them was Harpy's Gold and he did
403	Morrigen	2014-04-07	Yes, Dany and Jon are long lost twins, separated at birth.Â  

That would explain Alfie Allen's Star Wars quote, wouldn't it??
On a separate note, they are definitely setting up the Rhaegar & Lyanna storyline.  I suspect we shall see Bran tap into the weirnet more than once this season.  Anyone think we will see the Ned and the "let them grow up close as brothers" line this season??

Well, Bloodraven was already cast, so it's definitely possible (not sure what Bran will do next season then, though). 
As to the Star Wars thing, I think Alfie was inaccurately thinking of Rhaegar as a Vader (though perhaps he meant because Jon grew up assuming Rhaegar to be the enemy). The twins thing seems unlikely given that Viserys witnessed Dany's birth.

405	LadyMary	2014-04-07	Jon/Dany endgame CONFIRMED...Kidding, kidding. It did make me wonder, though.
Â 
The fact that the "dusk rose" was blue could just be propmaster shenanigans. "Dusk" sounds like more of a purplish colour, really.
Â 
The idea that the rose cured fever did remind of Lyanna's death, since she supposedly was suffering of fever when she died.
Â 
..."Dusk rose" first made me think of the "dusky woman," now that I think of it.


The blue rose looked so fake... but I still loved it. It was a nice wink to the book readers, along with the references to the Sword of the Morning and Duncan the Tall.
406	King Belushi	2014-04-07	Crackpot as fuck, but, perhaps the three flowers was also a nod to the "three mounts".
Lady's lace = One to bed
Harpy's Gold = One to dread
Dusk Rose = Â One to love

I find this more plausible than the three-headed dragon extrapolation.

Agreed--I always thought it was more a figurative nod to the theme, rather than a direct one.  Forgot to "wink"!  I've always assumed he was inferring the whole good vs evil/hidden father trope.   
As for the hints, it is definitely time to have them included.
409	eyeheartsansa	2014-04-08	While the Lyana symbolism is self evident and the links to other parts of the story are interesting, the use of red, white and blue together really jumped out at me, because to me there has always been something profoundly American - for better or for worse - about Dany's policy. Â I wonder if this was also intentional on the part of the writers. Â Thoughts?
410	MoIaF	2014-04-08	Crackpot as fuck, but, perhaps the three flowers was also a nod to the "three mounts".

Dusk Rose = Â One to love
Â

Â 
This isn't that crackpot, in the discussion thread for the first episode someone there put it like this:
Â 
Lady's lace = Drogon
Harpy's Gold = Hizface (Harpy and all)
Dusk Rose =Â  Jon
411	roxWolfox	2014-04-08	My first thought when I saw the blue rose was 'yes'!Â  Follow by a fistpump.Â 
When Oberyn brought up Rhaegar and the 'other woman' starting a war,Â  I immediately wondered if he would say something to Sansa about her aunt.Â  Then the rose appeared, and I began to salivate at the thought of Selmy seeing it, and letting her know a little bit of the blue rose connection to her brother.Â  Either way, what a fantastic moment that was.Â
412	Ser Oromus Locke	2014-04-08	Well on top of that Oberyn did mention Lyanna vaguely in his aside with Tyrion. Â Not specifically at all, but enough that any further elaboration could bring up the subject easily. Might be that now that they know most of the ending for sure, they may be starting to reference smaller details like that to prepare the show to bring them up effectively in these next three or so seasons the show has left.
Â 
Not enough of an indication to suggest that this is the case, but not too far from possible.


Â 
With all the hint dropping that went on.. It basically showed us that D&D had a convo with themselves and said: If we don't start dropping hints immediately, the fans will accuse us of pulling a Lost..
Â 
AND BOOM! BLUE FLOWERS-references - implicite to Lyanna, KINGSGUARD THAT WERE AT THE TOJ-references, EXPLICIT references to Lyanna!
Â 
It's only a vague mention to non-readers, but when Oberyn says: "Another woman, which started a war" then that is explicit enough for me. The events of episode 1 pretty much dictate it to be Lyanna. No other woman could've led that Baratheon to go to war against the Targaryen's he hated so much, based on those scenes in the crypts.
Â 
Unless you want explicit to mean: "He left her for Lyanna Stark, sister to Ned Stark and betrothed to Bob Baratheon.."
Â 


Crackpot as fuck, but, perhaps the three flowers was also a nod to the "three mounts".

I know it seems like one hell of a stretch but there is something in that scene, I know it.


Â 
I think this is a better one then the three heads things, but really:
- Lady's Lace - a contraceptive: Khal Drogo?
- Harpy's Gold - a poison: Hizfaze zo Pregnant
- Dusk Rose - a Stark flower: Jon Snow
Â 
I really don't see Lady's Lace being tied to Drogo in any way possible. Especially if Lady's Lace is a contraceptive.. Wait.. Perhaps it is, because Drogo pretty much laid bare Dany..
413	Chebyshov	2014-04-08	I really don't see Lady's Lace being tied to Drogo in any way possible. Especially if Lady's Lace is a contraceptive.. Wait.. Perhaps it is, because Drogo pretty much laid bare Dany..

415	King Belushi	2014-04-08	Well, considering the fate of Drogo's child, tying their relationship to a contraceptive makes some sense.
After all, Drogo was indirectly responsible for Dany's abortion.
I've gotta watch it again. It was actually said to be a contraceptive?

No, they don't say what its use is.
417	ViennaGirl	2014-04-08	I think Drogo was one to love. Jon might be one to dread in the prophecy, if he comes back from the dead. Daario could be one to bed.Â
418	Chebyshov	2014-04-08	I always hoped it wasn't literally about three guys she was going to bang, so that Drogon could be her "to dread"

Â 
Drogon /Hizface seem most likely to be the ones to dread. Drogon is sometimes compared with Ballarion "The Black Dread". And she definable dreaded marrying Hizface.
Â 
She did come to love Drogo, but they weren't married for love. It was business.
420	Jaheira	2014-04-08	Although I dont really like the theory about the three dragon riders, the scene with the blue rose definitely reminded me of it!
Why did Daario give her exactly THREE flowers?
Two possibilites:
1) Three flowers for three dragon riders
2) Three flowers for the three "prophecies" (one to love, one to bed, one to dread)
Â 
However, the mentioning of the three-headed dragon appears overall in the books, so it definitely has some kind of important meaning for the plot. Soooo in my opinion, the three flowers could symbolize Jon, Dany, and Tyrion as dragon riders!
Â 
1) Jon: The blue rose of course- as you already pointed out, that connection is obvious
2) Dany: The red rose- red stands for fire- Dany as the Azor Ahai reborn
3) Tyrion: The "lost" Targaryen. To me, revealing Tyrion as another "lost" Targaryen would not really make me happy, because it seems a bit TOO much Targaryen for me. However, there are some hints that cannot be denied which would speak for the Tyrion= Targaryen theory... Aerys favourizing Tyrions mother, Tyrion having the most POV chapters next to Jon and Dany, Tyrion on his way to Dany. Aaand.... one extremely interesting hint can be found in the new Tyrion chapter of TWOW: A WHITE cyvasse dragon falls down, rolls in front of Tyrions feet and he picks it up. The dragon looks like WHITE WOOD with RED VEINES ( ---> WEIRWOOD). Ergo, Tyrion would be the rider of the WHITE dragon Viserion (white flower).
Â 
Any thoughts on that?

Â 
King Belushi and Ser Oromus Locke connected the prophecys and three-heads very neatly with the flowers.
Â 
I really hope the flowers arenÂ´t just a hint on the dragonrider... Just some thoughts on it:
Â 
1. I have to wonder, if the blue rose really is an obvious Jon connection. I would say the symbolism of all the flowers has several layers. Of course you have Lyanna and her several blue rose-symbols. But you also have the bael the bard story. Blue roses arenÂ´t just a hint to Lyanna. It is a connection to the daughters of Winterfell. It could very well be a nod to Sansa and Arya as well.
(Seeing how Sansa got blue instead of purple Jewels and her dresses almost always have a blue theme...)
I think it was a Jon-Lyanna-Targ-thing. But we shouldnÂ´t overlook other possibilities and I wouldnÂ´t use the term obvious.
Â 
2. I donÂ´t think Dany is the poisonous red. As it is named HarpyÂ´s Gold this could be a hint on the dangers in Mereen. I would prefer it to be a hint on Tyrion as a poisonous Lannister, or the Lannisters overall.
Â 
3. I really hate these Tyrion=Targ-Theories... It is kitschy, plain and stupid in my opinion. It would robb Tyrion of almost all his underlying family-issues... And I like to interpret such hints as a foreshadowing of his future connection with dragons and Targaryens. LadyÂ´s Lace and the colouring doesnÂ´t strike me as neither very Tyrion-like nor Targaryen-like.
I have actually no idea what this could mean.
It is interesting as a contraceptive, while Dany is told to be barren. Also Lady was the name of a certain direwolf, so perhaps...
I really think this one has something to do with Dany herself. Again: I have no clue, what it could mean.

I think they changed the colour of the jewels because the term "purple wedding" is known by a lot of show watchers and GRRM has been trying to put it around that this is due to the colour of the wine rather than the poison (which they obviously don't want show watchers to know about). If people saw a necklace with big purple gems they would figure it out quite easily.
Â 
This kind of thing is why I don't trust SSMs any more.
423	Neumond	2014-04-09	Sounds pretty convincing. I guess you are right about it.

Â 
Yup.
Â 
For a show that many of us love in part for the tiniest details it gets right - actually having an entry for Arthur Dayne even though it goes by too fast to be read by viewers, the brilliant transitions (Joffrey posing like his statue in Two Swords, or swallowing wine at a wedding just as Stannis and Melisandre throw blood on a fire and say his name) etc., there is NO WAY that was not intentional. OF COURSE it was.
Â 
What it could mean in terms of plot developments, though? No clue.

The gems are on a necklace and the poison...gem was on a hairpiece, right?
Â 
Either they're going to change that plot element to make it a necklace, or the necklace will be pinned in her hair, or the gems will be used to make a hairpiece, or these won't be the suspect gems at all.

427	Ghosteline	2014-04-09	Only th book readers can make such connectiones with the flowers.

Nor should they at first. They're just laying down the foundation for what is likely to be a reveal later. In the meantime, our book-reader heads will continue to explode with all these little goodies peppered in.
Â 
Side note, but I'm wondering how many straight show-watchers theory-craft at all. Because if that's their kind of thing, you'd think they'd read the source material?

Â 
Yes, I suppose they would if they were after something. I just feel like there could be so much more connecting hints. Sometimes the dialogues are also too plain and don't give much away. But then again, I see the show as a book reader and maybe for straight show-watchers theres plenty to ponder about. Â
430	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-09	Although I dont really like the theory about the three dragon riders, the scene with the blue rose definitely reminded me of it!
Why did Daario give her exactly THREE flowers?
Two possibilites:
1) Three flowers for three dragon riders
2) Three flowers for the three "prophecies" (one to love, one to bed, one to dread)
Â 
However, the mentioning of the three-headed dragon appears overall in the books, so it definitely has some kind of important meaning for the plot. Soooo in my opinion, the three flowers could symbolize Jon, Dany, and Tyrion as dragon riders!
Â 
1) Jon: The blue rose of course- as you already pointed out, that connection is obvious
2) Dany: The red rose- red stands for fire- Dany as the Azor Ahai reborn
3) Tyrion: The "lost" Targaryen. To me, revealing Tyrion as another "lost" Targaryen would not really make me happy, because it seems a bit TOO much Targaryen for me. However, there are some hints that cannot be denied which would speak for the Tyrion= Targaryen theory... Aerys favourizing Tyrions mother, Tyrion having the most POV chapters next to Jon and Dany, Tyrion on his way to Dany. Aaand.... one extremely interesting hint can be found in the new Tyrion chapter of TWOW: A WHITE cyvasse dragon falls down, rolls in front of Tyrions feet and he picks it up. The dragon looks like WHITE WOOD with RED VEINES ( ---> WEIRWOOD). Ergo, Tyrion would be the rider of the WHITE dragon Viserion (white flower).
Â 
Any thoughts on that?


Â 
I do like this theory and I'm not completely opposed to Tyrion being a Targ. However, I would say Tyrion would be the Red flower (poison) and Dany the white.Â 
Â 
I have to disagree on Dany beingÂ Azor Ahai reborn. I believe it's Jon because his is the 'song of Ice and Fire' whereas Dany is completely Targ with no connections to the first Long Night while Jon has Stark (Ice) connections and relations to those involved like Bran the Builder. I think the fight against the Others has Stark territory written all over it so Dany becoming the champion (having no prior experience with the North or Wall) would be distasteful compared to Jon building up his central plot since book 1. Â However, who knows?

Yes, I think they're really beginning to lay down the hidden R+L=J clues and building up a profile for Rhaegar and Lyanna. I hope we'll see something Lyanna related in Bran's visions or during story time from the Reeds (she-wolf/KotLT). Â

Â 
No, because that's a very unsupported theory (as are any "Rhaegar is alive" theories). Same with Benny. I'd put both theories deep into the "crackpot" category.
Â 
Blue roses n the books are often associated with Lyanna, and therefore with Jon, if you believe R+L=J (which is a very popular theory, and quite well-founded, IMO).
Â 
The reason people are freaking out about the rose, especially because it followed a scene with an assumed reference to Lyanna, is that people think it's the way of the show-runners starting to pepper in R+L groundwork. The blue rose, which Daario says helps to cure fevers, recalls R+L=J, as Lyanna died of a fever in a room that smelled "like blood and roses," she loved the blue winter roses in the Winterfell glass gardens, Rhaegar gave her a crown of blue roses at the tourney, etc.
Â 
Because Jon is thereby also associated with the blue rose (being her spawn and born in that room where she died), Dany being handed the blue rose is being interpreted as many different things; people assume Jon and Dany's fates will become intertwined at some point, with Jon being one of the heads of the dragon, or being the mount Dany rides "to love." All of this is pure speculation, of course, but this rose being brought out in a bouquet of 3 is drawing extra attention.
Â 
IMO they're going to drop little hints here and there, but I don't think we should bend over backwards to analyze this scene. We have the source material if we want to obsess over anything.

Â 
OK, thanks for not making me feel even more stupid. Â I do definitely believe the R+L=J theory is true. Â I thought I was a genius for figuring that out on a 2nd read of Game of Thrones. Â Then I started looking around on here and found out it's pretty common knowledge. Â
435	northernwarg	2014-04-10	I think the writers were setting up the story for when the Pale Mare hits Meereen.
Â 
I do think the writers are going to completely introduce R+L = J as a theory this year (not confirm or deny, just introduce). Â But The events in Meereen are Dany's arch for this season, so it makes sense to use the flowers more directly with that part of her story. Â Daario even makes a point of telling Dany that she needs to know the land in order to rule her people. Â Now Dany knows that when a fever hits her people, she needs to find blue roses.Â 


Totally
436	jet199	2014-04-11	His bright blue eyes. On the road from Yunkai, Daario had brought her a flower or a sprig of some plant every evening when he made his report â<U+0080>¦ to help her learn the land, he said.

Â 
I thought I'd post the quote from the book up. Having a second look at it it seems it might be a list of people Dany may meet. I wonder if they are people who will help her learn the land when she gets to Westeros. The show probably picked the most important people (prickly ben didn't make it); dusk rose which would be Jon, lady's lace which could be Sansa and harpy's gold which has Lannister colours so could be Tyrion if Dany meets him in Meereen or could be strong woman character.

Up until santa brought me the books, I was a show watcher, and didn't plan on touching the books until the show had finished and the books were all written. 
Some of my pre-book theories included 
1. R+L = J
2. Sam would become the saviour of the wall against the ww
3. Gendry would become king eventually
4. Jon would contact Dany for a lend of her dragons against the ww
5. Tywin would bump joffrey off
I had more but they were my favourite ones to argue with my friend about.  Occasionally a book reader friend would throw us little scraps of info and we would argue those points too. I was 100% sure cat would become a Wight somehow.
Edited to add my actual point.........
My friend the non book reader was on to the blue rose = Lyanna nod.

Brilliant. I think that could be it. The show rarely has scenes like that; ones that don't lay groundwork for something, provide exposition, move the story forward. So I tend to believe that scene is foreshadowing something.
439	ginaflynn	2014-04-15	I believe the blue rose means lyanna is danys real mother, ned found them at the tower of joy and seperated the twins somehow, took dany to dorne because he couldnt take a targ looking baby back to winterfell with him. I also think this is why dany dreams and thinks of the house with the red door, and the lemon tree outsideÂ where she was happy. I dont believe that dany was born on dragonstone to queen rhaela. The ring that dany wears on her finger probably has something to do with who her true mother . could have been lyannas ring. Im not going to type all of the other reasons i believe this to be true im too tired.another thing i interperated was in danys dreams she said I dont have the exact quotes here are some she felt her blood boil, her and the dragon screamed as one, Id have to look up other referances but I believe she is a warg from her stark side she also heard a wolf howl off in the distance that made her feel sad and lonely hint hint from GRRM. also there was talk of two moons meaning twins,also mance rayder who i believe is her father prince rhaegar ,Dany will bring the black dragon Drogon to him to ride after all he is the LAST DRAGON! to tired to write any more you guys have to look at theÂ big picture endgame.Â
440	Talking Hodor	2014-04-15	Daario = Rhaegar confirmed!Â  


Every character in all of Westeros and Essos = GRRM.Â  The books will end with a schizophrenic in a hospital waking up after a crazy dream about knights and direwolves and dragons.

So the "who shot JR?" comparison to this episode is appropriate?
442	REVEALnothing	2014-11-03	Â  Am I the only one who thought it was a clue pointing to Jon, Sansa and Aria some how being AegonÂ  and his sister wives returned??(or something)Â I know it is kinda out there, but as book readers know. The Dusk/Winter Rose= Jon.
Â 
butÂ asÂ Lady was Sansa's wolfs name,Lady's Lace. andÂ we know thatÂ Sansa's husband will be in the area with Dani soon,
Â 
and Harpy's Gold "Is very beautiful but Poisonous' Â  If Aria=FM? could the Harpy take a contrack out on her?
443	Darkbringer	2014-04-07	How did we think it went down? I loved the back and forward about the chickens, the actors playing the Hound and Polliver nailed it. That cock-eyed bloody expression from Polliver, I loved it. Didnt seem like the Hound got properly wounded though, well have to see next episode, but there should be no good reason to leave that out. Overall, well built up scene, and well choreographed.Â 
Â 
"I understand that If i hear any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth, Ill have to eat every fucking chicken in this room."
Â 
Gold, pure gold.Â 
Â 
We can see Arya starting to go full darkside now, and its awesome.Â 
Â 
Also crazy ultra-violence with the hound smashing that guy's face down onto the dagger. Hound is such a weapon.Â
444	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	One of my favourite scenes in the series thus far...
Â 
There was just so much going on from the start when Arya wants a horse - quickly and smoothly allowed an insight into where both characters were at and that they have a chance to get Arya to the Vale.
Â 
The hedge-spying - well done but completely outshone by the 'What the fuck is a Lommy?" line.
Â 
Once they entered the tavern though - mind = blown. So much going on in the dialogue between Poliver and Sandor.Â 
Â 
The brawl itself was well choreographed and reaffirmed The Hound's menace.
Â 
Arya's first kill was great and her second was just brilliant. I would have just liked to have seen a tad more menace in the first kill - something reminiscent of Brienne's 'Two Quick Deaths', but definitely no complaints from me.
Â 
And the closing - showing the desolation of the Riverlands. This was a key part of Arya's story in the books - it served to show the suffering of the small-folk. I felt this was missing somewhat in the previous seasons but I am really happy they have gone that way now.

Yeah totally. That place has just copped so much pain, its good to see that shown properly. Â
446	The Last Reyne	2014-04-07	While I found the scene to be outstanding and great fun, I find myself missing Arya going berserk and having to be pulled off. This seemed more calculating without the bloodlust that comes over her in the book. Still loads of fun though.
447	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-07	Show Arya avenging Lommy never gave me the chills that book Arya killing the Tickler or

 gave me, it feel kind of bland compared to those scenes.

For me it was the opposite. In the books she goes beserk (AKA S3E10). While in the show you see the point where she makes a decision, and goes down another path, and relishes the killing. Much darker, I feel. .Â

Â 
It's only Episode 1, plenty of time and events between here and then.Â 
Â 
Such a great scene. It's one of those moments where I know it's coming, but I'm still holding my breath waiting for the penny to drop. Sandor kept going for his drink, and I'm sitting there thinking do it do it do it!
Â 
Thought for a second that Arya wouldn't intervene, but nope... I loved how decisive it felt for her. It was cold, calculated bloodlust. I was so happy for the throwback to Harrenhal and Lommy. Made it all feel full circle.
452	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-07	He may yet be wounded, we'll just have to wait and see.Â 


Â 
Or whatever group Polliver was marauding with will catch up.Â
453	The Last Reyne	2014-04-07	I agree it felt much darker than in the book and I don't think Arya was at that point yet. She is in the middle of a process of becoming darker but isn't there yet.
454	moonjump05	2014-04-07	He may yet be wounded, we'll just have to wait and see.Â 


Â 
If they didn't have it here I figure they will just drop the subplot entirely. Â Makes sense, one less location and less casting to be done. Â Just wonder if they will kill off the Hound (I hope not), have him travel further with Arya Â before becoming injured or just plain left behind, or something new entirely.
Â 
Though his living in the show at this point does bode well for his as of yet not entirely confirmed vacation on the Quiet Ilse and continued survival.
455	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-07	So we can assume Sandor will not be headed to the Quiet Ilse?

Â 
Â 
I think I agree with the Kinkslayer.
I would have preferred a "is there gold in the Village" reference, since Polliver was one of her Harrenhal captors / torturers as well. (What she did here in the show also relates to a later event - negating it ?)
Â 
Plus I hope the Harrenhal reference isn't lost in her dialogue with the Hound later. She was the Mountain's prisoner, and Tywin's cupbearer FFS !

I would have preferred a "is there gold in the Village" reference, since Polliver was one of her Harrenhal captors / torturers as well.Â 


Â 
"Is there gold in the village" didn't have the repetition in the show as it did in the books so it carries far far less meaning as much as to be irrelevant to the show. Linking the events here directly to Lommy's death is enough to demonstrate the path of vengeance Arya has started to travel.

Â 
Â 
It wouldn't need repetition, just a sinister edge to it - let's say that (in his last moments) he realizes to his horror that this is Lord Tywin's (escaped from Harrenhal) cupbearer who's got him dead to rights.

459	ground_control	2014-04-07	I thought the scene was *mostly* good.
Â 
1) I didn't like Polliver downplaying "torture, torture, and more torture" under Gregor -- it almost seemed like he was criticizing Gregor. Â It would have been better if Polliver made it seem like he liked working for "Ser", and then having it clear that that sealed his fate.
Â 
2) Sandor's line about hearing another word from Polliver's mouth would have been much more effective if (like Jaime in AFFC), Sandor would have opened up the second Polliver started to say something else, instead of waiting for Polliver to finish his speech.
Â 
3) I don't remember if it was in Season 2, but if not, it would have been better to act out having raped the innkeeper's daughter and asking for change, which was (in ACOK) attributed to Ser Gregor.
Â 
4) Less exposition by Arya to The Hound while spying on the inn.
460	Newstar	2014-04-07	Yeah totally. That place has just copped so much pain, its good to see that shown properly. Â 


Â 
I got real The Road vibes from that shot.
Â 
I wouldn't declare the Quiet Isle plot a no-go or assume that the Season 4 arc won't mirror the books just yet. The Hound could have a minor wound that winds up festering due to lack of proper treatment (not too different from what happened with Khal Drogo), or he could get into another skirmish and get wounded in that one.
Â 
The Hound seems just a shade too chipper in his scenes, although I guess they could wear him down more gradually as their situation becomes more and more bleak.

Â 
Â 
1) I actually liked his little bit about torturing people until it got boring. You could see that flash of hate in Arya's eyes, and so I thought it would have been a great lead-in to an "is there gold in the Village" death for him. Rather than the Lommy one.
Â 
4) To me, if they had made it more meaningful exposition, that would be fine. The Hound should know his brother's men well enough, and that his brother was holding Harrenhal, so if Arya said she'd been there, that means ...Â 
if you know what I mean.

Agree, in the books it took a while after the inn before he couldnt go on, IIRC
464	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-07	Its great to see them showing the Riverlands being sacked/burned and people still talking about the Battle of Blackwater. Last season they barely talked about either of them and the burning of Winterfell, ironborn talking the North etc
465	Envie	2014-04-07	Â 
Â 
And does anyone else think his scars were hardly there ?


Â 
I did notice his face didn't seem as burned / scarred as it did in the earlier seasons at King's Landing. It still looked misshapen and odd though.Â 
Â 
As for the previous comment that he looked too 'chipper' no I don't think so - he still seems pretty dour and pissed off at the world nor does he seem overly strong in the fight scene. They got him on the ground and were kicking him, so it's obvious he's not at his top game to me. He's hungry and worn down and they've been riding a long time with no gold or food. If they're going to keep the plot the same as from the books or similar, it will probably be next episode that he reveals he's injured worse than Arya could have seen.Â 
Â 
Arya however, seems damn chipper riding her own horse with Needle back. Her smile was priceless. I think it's fine she's going down the 'dark' path already. She's seen a lot of death this far - don't forget she just came from witnessing a lot of what happened at the Red Wedding if not her Mother and brother's deaths directly, she was outside watching much of the carnage before the Hound knocked her out. She's clearly been traumatized by that. Not even all the deaths and destruction along the roadside phased her. She's only got vengeance keeping her going.
466	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-07	Did anyone else think the guy on top of the Hound was very similar to Oberyn on top of Gregor.
Â 
He even grabs his face the same way trying to stick his fingers in his eyes and then smashes it down killing him.Â

Â 
Interesting. Honestly it all happened so fast, I didn't even think of that. Nice catch!
468	the stranger in the dark	2014-04-07	This for me was the highlight of the episode, starting with the conversation between the Hound and Polliver and then the fight ending with the a just revenge for Lommy.Â 
Â 
When Arya is watching the hound fight it seems like she is studying his style and then goes into action. The fact that the hound doesn't seem hurt can easily be fixed with a scene in coming episodes where he is complaining that a cut isn't healing.
Â 
Arya has been getting dark since Ned's death, first learning about when to kill and not with Jaqen H'gharÂ in Harrenhal and then killing for justice and how sometimes justice is blind with the Men without banners. With the Hound it is the next step in the education which is sending her in a darker direction, killing to survive and enjoying the thrill. Her story is different from the book but It is happen at roughly the same pace if you think about the amount of time Arya gets onscreen.
469	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	Â 
Â 
It wouldn't need repetition, just a sinister edge to it - let's say that (in his last moments) he realizes to his horror that this is Lord Tywin's (escaped from Harrenhal) cupbearer who's got him dead to rights.


Â 
Did not the lines used have a sinister edge? Did he not realise who she was and the vengeance he was about to fall to?
Â 
The 'gold' line is memorable to many readers because of the way it was used. Had it not been for its repetition, it would not have had the meaning it did when it was finally used.Â 
Â 
TV is primarily a visual medium. Linking the event to Lommy's death had far more impact than linking it to a line that was used, what... twice during the rat torture scenes - no matter how much menace was used.
470	Red Tiger	2014-04-07	For me it was the opposite. In the books she goes beserk (AKA S3E10). While in the show you see the point where she makes a decision, and goes down another path, and relishes the killing. Much darker, I feel. .Â 


I agree with this, the methodical and downright relaxed way she did it made me believe something had died inside her. Which is probably true.
471	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	I agree with this, the methodical and downright relaxed way she did it made me believe something had died inside her. Which is probably true.


Â 
Exactly - she had witnessed the Red Wedding, and had the blood lust vent in last season. She has moved on now to something.... darker.
472	Red Tiger	2014-04-07	Also, the icy, pitiless way she asked "can you walk boy" (It REEKED with sadism) and her riding away on that horse with a psycho smirk afterwards was chilling.
Â 
The only person in the series I can picture doing this is Yara Greyjoy and that should tell you everything about what has happened to Arya. I could EASILY see this version of Arya turning into a faceless man and NEVER looking back.
Â 
If Ned saw her like this he would have a frickin heart attack.

Arya had one of the best lines EVER after her kill of Poliver in the books.
Â 
Fighting with the Hound + against the Mountains Men + in the Riverlands (wastelands) = badass
476	Ironborn Chop	2014-04-07	For me she looked more serial killer than a child filled with rage. Just wasn't my interpretation when I read it and I think Martin does it better. Arya looked like a psychopath rather than the lost soul that she is in the book. Another scene at the end of the last season when she drops the coin and stabs the hell out of the Frey soldier, the way she talks in that scene she sounds so psychotic and flips the coin like "whoopsy" but when she escapes Harrenhal she acts calm as you like and swiftly slits the guard's throat. I just prefer Arya in the books than the series. Think Maisie plays her well though.
Always used to be one of these people who thought reading a book would never match watching on-screen with music and everything but how the tables have turned! I still admire the show very much.
477	Ironborn Chop	2014-04-07	She has completely forgotten her training in the series whereas in the books it is constantly in her mind

Welcome to the Forum 
Â 
As for reading vs watching, when you read something, you build up a version of the world in your own mind and it becomes 'yours'. With a film or TV show, you are watching someone else's interpretation of the story.
479	Ironborn Chop	2014-04-07	It was one of the main reasons I didn't want to read the books before I had watched the series as I could picture a place, a voice or a face that had been shown to me but I just don't think the series compares anymore! I don't mind that though because I love the books so much!
I completely agree about my interpretation but it is the little details that D&D change about GRRM's work that gets to me. Anyway! I'm still engrossed by it. Can't wait to see where whores go!

481	GHOSTSTARK	2014-04-07	Show Arya avenging Lommy never gave me the chills that book Arya killing the Tickler or

 gave me, it feel kind of bland compared to those scenes.

that was so awesome. its like she just flipped the switch to becoming full badass
482	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-07	She has completely forgotten her training in the series whereas in the books it is constantly in her mind


Â 
I don't see how she's forgotten her training.
483	Fool of a Book	2014-04-07	A little nitpicky but... Arya seemed to take too long to get in on the action. Â Was Polliver just lying there near her under the table all that time? Â Why wasn't she moving to intervene when the Hound had a knife at his throat? Â Why not glance at Polliver, at the least, to see where he is?
Â 
The first kill with the sword was unrealistically and strangely slow, the way she gently glided it into the guy's chest. Â The slowness worked better with the Polliver kill.
Â 
Also, one moment of eye contact between Arya and the Hound during the fight would have been welcome... that we see the Hound's reaction to what she does to Polliver.
Â 
I loved the scene but I think I will always, for all eternity, watch this scene and think a slow gentle piercing with a huge sword is not realistic. Â She barely put her weight behind it.

A case of 'reality is unrealistic', you can actually pierce human flesh quite easily if you have a sharp enough blade, even slowly (as any person who's had an anatomy class can tell you).

Clarifying: Â An 80 pound child gently, in a life or death situation, gliding a long and heavy sword into anything, flesh or not, without putting a some effort into it, is unrealistic, especially considering it's her first kill with a sword that huge, and she has no idea now heavy his clothing or armor might be, and doesn't know if she'll hit bone or not. Â I wasn't talking about anatomy, I was talking about the logistics of that part of the scene.

The slowness worked better with Polliver because it was the exposed flesh of his neck with her trusty Needle.
488	Mordos_Kull	2014-04-07	I guess we won't be getting the Mountain and the Inn Keeper's daughter, as I take it she was only doing that episode.
Â 
Seeing as The Mountain is in 3 episodes, I'm trying to figure out what he'll be doing in the first appearance.
Â 
Could he be at the Wedding?
489	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-07	So we can assume Sandor will not be headed to the Quiet Ilse?


Â He may be wounded, and we just don't know it yet, or he may yet become wounded in the next few episodes. The fine details of the show haven't always matched the book. Maybe they have Arya wound him herself. The future of Sandor may still play a big part in the books, and I doubt they would just drop this part of the plot altogether.
490	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-04-07	the hound can't get fatally wounded in the premiere episode. he's a fan favorite and i think D&D will try and drag him out as long as possible

Since they [felt they] had to show Lommy's death from Season 2 in the recap, I'd argue that it was *just* as memorable (i.e., not at all) as the lines used in the show...they could just easily have used the lines from Season 2 and shown those scenes in the recap.
492	Cas Stark	2014-04-07	This made me laugh out loud. Â

Â 
The Hound demands a chicken. No, two chickens. He has no money. He doesn't care because he's The Hound. He downs beer like a man. And, 56 minutes into the 59-minute episode, we get to see some killing.

493	Le Cygne	2014-04-07	I thought it was a good scene.Â  I don't think he's wounded.Â  We know of a bunch more scenes to come, including a scene where he shows Arya how to give the gift of mercy, a scene where Arya practices with Needle and he's standing by watching, a scene where it looks like she may be warging and he's looking at her, etc.Â  And there is a fight scene that is supposed to be really big and bloody to come.

I pretty much agree with all of that. Â Was she waiting because she wasn't sure whether she wanted the Hound to live, or because they wanted to show it as a deliberate decision on her part (emphasizing the cataclysmic change undergone by the character)?
495	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-07	Is it just me or does it seem like they are setting up Polliver's "group" aka leftovers of Gregor marauding leaderless is going to be the Brave Companions? Rorge and Biter make their return and I don't see them shaking up with "Locke." This could be a way to tie the two together as well?
496	Newstar	2014-04-07	I thought the whole sequence was pretty draggy, but upon reread, I see it's pretty draggy in the books as well.
497	ViennaGirl	2014-04-07	Though his living in the show at this point does bode well for his as of yet not entirely confirmed vacation on the Quiet Ilse and continued survival.


this is what I'm afraid of. I loved him on the Quiet Isle. And I think Arya leaving him by the road is pretty much where she leaves her humanity behind, so I think it's important.
498	Sarah Lannister	2014-04-07	The action sequences were really brutal, and I cheered every time the Hound punched someone.

500	JesterX	2014-04-07	I actually didn't like the way they made Arya hold back until the fighting was pretty much done..Â  I would've had her jump in sooner.
501	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-07	It was excellent, despite diversions from the book. The whole conversation about the chickens helped to build the tension effectively. It reminded me of a scene out of a Tarantino movie; slowly boiling along until it reaches the inevitable confrontation.

they will probably have him wounded in a later episode.
this revenge kill was awesome for arya, but i'm still mad that they killed off the tickler earlier. when she kills him in the book, it is amazing. im gonna miss her yelling the questions at him. still loved this scene though.

508	RhaenysBalerion	2014-04-07	I thought this scene was a drag. Too long for a start. All the talking with Polliver, what was the point to that? Then they went for each other and you could literally see and feel the choreographer in the background commanding their every move, it was so artificial. And Arya was just standing there with the same blank expression she had on during the never-ending Polliver-Hound talk, watching as they fought, not quite knowing what she was expected to do (as an actress, not as the character herself). Then there was Polliver and she grabbed Needle and for a brief moment the genius S01 child actress shined up, but only for a moment and then she was too calm and too serious and there was no trace of the broken, messed up, furious book Arya driven by vengeance, justice, pain, loss and helplessness. Just a Let's make a memorable scene now face of a disciplined actress. To sum up all this blabber, it didn't suck me in, I didn't believe it. And that's an entirely subjective opinion, and I'm glad most people liked the scene.Â

Â 
Some thoughts about Arya
Â 
In the show the most traumatic thing she has seen is the Red wedding and its aftermath. The questioning of the villagers was only a brief interlude. It made sense therefore not to give us the Arya from the books until the end of season 3. We've already had her show equivalant of the Tickler scene where she goes manianical on the Frey soldier.
Â 
Now we see a far more cold blooded calculating Arya. Some have said they didnt like the way she hung back. I think she was simply assessing the situation and only entered the fight when she could do so without risk, attacking a couple of guys from behind who were focused solely on the hound. Who knows if the fight had gone against the hound she might have bolted for the door instead. It is that cold bloodedness that the needed to bring for Arya in the show, not the killing rage.
512	acejack	2014-04-07	Â 
Exactly - she had witnessed the Red Wedding, and had the blood lust vent in last season. She has moved on now to something.... darker.


Agree 100%. As much as I loved the book version, if she went all "gold & silver" on Polliver after she had already killed the Frey soldier in a similar manner it wouldn't have done anything to develop the character. The audience would just think she's this pissed off stabby little kid.
513	Giorgio Corrado	2014-04-07	Arya has the making of a female version of Tywin become just as cold blooded and ruthless soon enough.
514	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-07	I thought the scene was done pretty damn well, however I'm on board with the "psychotic repeating of questions while brutually stabbing him" being more impactful. The problem is they basically took two great revenge kills from Arya (The Tickler & Raff) and morphed them into 1. It was a good scene, but it all goes back to why the hell did they have to kill the Tickler??? Just sucks that the best part of the TWOW Mercy sample chapter is now eliminated from the show. Oh well, still quite the scene.Â

I don't know what that means, a lot of inventing to do now.I figure the Hound gets his 'ambiguous fatal wound' in either episode 8 or 10.
522	boojam	2014-04-07	This is oddly, in a totally different way, the Arya-Mercy chapter from Winds of Winter...Noted: In the book, as in S4E1, Arya seemingly saves the Hounds life, Polliver may have been able to surprise him if she has not taken action.(The squire is missing , some random guy , she kills, takes his place).In the book, I think it was before this, Sandor starts called her She Wolf, I hope they use that in the show.

Â 
I'm thinking they just need some more padding on her story line so that she doesn't get to Braavos too soon. AFFC/ADWD has barely enough for her to cover one season, but her plot's kind of thin here at this point. If the padding they choose is The Hound and The She Wolf kicking ass and taking names, I'm down with it.
524	teemo	2014-04-07	They should have just kept it as the Tickler imo. Â That fight scene and crazed stabbing and yelling about gold is one of my favorite parts in the series. Â There was a lot of questions back in the day - "but who will remember the Tickler by that time?" Â Well, who the hell remembers Polliver? Â Arya had to remind the audience who Polliver was. Â I was very disappointed.
525	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-07	I agree with all the people sayin' it took too long for Arya to act. I expeced her to go berzerk at any moment, t'was on the edge of my seat - and then she waited... Waited... Waited. Sweet brawl nonetheless, but I think she should've jumped in sooner.

Â 
The crazed stabbing took place in the finale of S3 with the Frey guard. Would be kind of silly to have her do it again.
Â 
People overvalue the Tickler kill in the books.

Polliver is a guy who the audience really wants to see get his comeuppance. It's a hugely cathartic scene.

The Tickler was killed already by Show!Jaqen


Â 
Yeah, I know.
530	NightStark	2014-04-07	Someone put the entire tavern scene up on Youtube, the Hound definitely took a cut across either his back or the back of his leg.
531	boojam	2014-04-07	I agree with all the people sayin' it took too long for Arya to act. I expeced her to go berzerk at any moment, t'was on the edge of my seat - and then she waited... Waited... Waited. Sweet brawl nonetheless, but I think she should've jumped in sooner.In the book she does hang back for a bit, but gets into the fray faster , in think, in the book Sandor has only Polliver and the Tickler , while Arya disables the Squire.As I remember the Hound has more trouble with Polliver as a swordsman than on the show.Tho he kills him.
532	Facelesss Fan	2014-04-07	Â 
Â 
It wouldn't need repetition, just a sinister edge to it - let's say that (in his last moments) he realizes to his horror that this is Lord Tywin's (escaped from Harrenhal) cupbearer who's got him dead to rights.


At the end he did realize it was Arya who killed him, reclaiming Needle.
533	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	Since they [felt they] had to show Lommy's death from Season 2 in the recap, I'd argue that it was *just* as memorable (i.e., not at all) as the lines used in the show...they could just easily have used the lines from Season 2 and shown those scenes in the recap.


Â 
Yes, they could have done that, sure.
Â 
Then we would have had to have had this exchange:
Â 
Arya: They were trying to get the villagers to tell them where the gold was.
Â 
Hound: What the fuck would they want gold from the villagers for?
Â 
Making Lommy's murder have a bigger impact on Arya's psyche makes more sense in the show.

537	SheRa Seastar	2014-04-08	While I found the scene to be outstanding and great fun, I find myself missing Arya going berserk and having to be pulled off. This seemed more calculating without the bloodlust that comes over her in the book. Still loads of fun though.

The books and the show are like the same horse with a different jockey. I think book Arya going berserk fitted well for her character, but show Arya is a little older and more collected, I thought the calm, calculated way she delivered her lines, and the sword to the neck was perfect for her, and reminded me of her water dancing training.
538	teemo	2014-04-08	Â 
The crazed stabbing took place in the finale of S3 with the Frey guard. Would be kind of silly to have her do it again.

Jesus fucking Christ, that shit is scary
540	Mordwyn of House Harcarste	2014-04-08	You can see Pollivers thought process during the conversation at the table, "The guy's brother is this totally insane beast of a knight with a knack for torture, am I actually going to attempt to fight him?" Â Â
541	Le Cygne	2014-04-08	In the book she does hang back for a bit, but gets into the fray faster , in think, in the book Sandor has only Polliver and the Tickler , while Arya disables the Squire.As I remember the Hound has more trouble with Polliver as a swordsman than on the show.Tho he kills him.

It's because he's drunk, he just heard Sansa got married, and reacted pretty strongly to the news.  He had to sit down, stared at the fire, said good for the little bird she got away, hoped Cersei would torture Tyrion in rather graphic terms, all the while downing wine.  Arya noticed it, he wasn't his usual self.  
In this fight, he was.  Here, it's when Polliver talks about raping Arya that he decides to kill them all, that's following up on that line last season about how he saved Sansa from rapists and would protect her, too.  Here, he saves both Arya and the innkeeper's daughter.  He was the only thing stopping them at this point.  
I have a hunch that's also what he meant by the code.  Arya asks, did you steal something from Joffrey?  Arya was talking about stealing money, the Hound was talking about something else (Sansa).  Ultimately, he's saying he's not his brother.  I think they may follow up on that, too.

Ah, I didn't even think about that. Do you think the show-runners still want that to be a thing, given how old Rory McCann is, or do you think that was more of a wink to book readers?

I have no idea, I want to see their book story on the show, it's a favorite.
The point I was making was that he's not his brother.  I do think they may get into that.  But I think they should also show his regret that he couldn't stop them from beating Sansa.   I think it's important for someone to remember they did that to her.  And that he can't forget and wishes he had done more is pretty big.
They did show him helping her recover from or avoiding the beatings, in season 1 and season 2, the heads scene, the name day scene, the throne room scene, also giving her advice, and finally he could strike back to protect her in the mob scene, and he did.  And that's also what he's saying in the Blackwater scene, I could keep you safe.  In the books he says, no one would hurt you again.
Then he keeps bringing it up to Arya, at the Beric fight, another time (they did include that on the show last season), and then he sobs about it in the end.  So this would follow up on that, and it's also tied to him being more of a true knight than he knows.  That's what he wanted to be before Gregor burned him.

There's actually two shots, separated by an almost invisible match cut, which I believe is where they switch between the real actor being jammed into a CGI dagger and a dummy being jammed against a real one.

555	NaarioDaharis	2014-04-09	I thought the dialogue was weird and kinda lame. I know its not a popular opinion. I enjoyed the scene during the show, loved the whole episode, but I didn't get the chicken joke. I also guess I was expecting a more heated confrontation like in the novels.
Â 
Critiquing the fighting-
Â 
-Throwing the table was awesome, nicely done.
Â 
-I was confused as to why Arya waited so long to get into the fight. She loves fighting.
Â 
-I know its a realism vs. show thing, but so many sword blocks. Swords were not used for so much blocking in combat.Â 
Â 
-Too many times swords meet, deflect, and the Hound punches the guy in the face. Often the beats between shots was too long. That's an actor/stunt guy thing, safety thing, but it takes me out.
Â 
-Arya can't just push a sword into a body like that. It looked silly. Even my mom who is a medical tech said something about it.
Â 
-Arya water dancing looked cool, but again she just stabbed through armor like it was nothing. Another thing show watchers don't really care about, but it took me out.
Â 
-The camera work was confusing and I didn't know what was going on most of the time.Â 
Â 
Still, had fun with it. The Hound was scary as hell in some shots and Arya got Needle back.Â 
Â 
BTW, did you gais KNOW?? That scene wiv Polliver wasn't in the booooks. It was from a TWOW chapter that JUST got released and I need to make sure you gais know I knew about it even though its already been mentioned in every thread on the website cuz I am smurt too and it was Raff the Sweetling so its totally gonna ruin everything guys OMG!!!

Â 
Â 


He may yet be wounded, we'll just have to wait and see.Â 


It looked like at one point during the fight the Hound got sliced pretty good on the back/side. Â Maybe they'll have it get worse over time.

Â 
He seemed to enjoyed himself at the end, smiling on his horse. He doesn't seem to have suffered a life-threatening wound unless I am mistaken. It looks like the directors of the show have other plans for him and that his faith will differ from that of the book.
Â 
I am torn somehow, as much as I want them to follow as much as possible the book line, I came to appreciate The Hound as a character both in the book and the show. Can't help wondering what will happen to him next, should his life be prolonged in season 4 of GoT.
Â 
I'll wait and see...

The camera never left Arya's eyes and they never flinched, or moved from supposedly staring down into Polliver's face. If in those 2 seconds, the injured and stunned Polliver had managed to scramble over from face down to laying on his back, her eyes would have moved and followed his action.

It's possible while on your knees to fall forward and turn your shoulder to end up on your back. You are right through, Polliver appeared to fall straight down on his face in the scene. Oh well.

Â 
When I watched this scene the first few times, I thought Arya slashed Polliver across the back of his legs too, but then after about the tenthÂ  watch  I thought it may have been a little higher. Doesn't matter anyway, it's not important.
Â 
Neither is the position Polliver fell onto the floor, or ended up in. It was just something I noticed that didn't quite look right. You're obviously right about the editing and it's only us pathetic GOT geeks, who study the tv show with such intensity and then subsequently pick unimportant little flaws.
Â

edit. Just watched over and over again on youtube and my original impression and yours is correct. Arya slashed him down low on his legs.

564	Woman of War	2014-04-10	I guess Sandor won't become an undertaker on the Quiet Isle but a chicken farmer 
Seriously, the show may want to present the wonderful dymamics of Arya and the Hound as long as possible and so Sandor may get wounded only towards the end of the season. 
And then there is the slight problem that Sandor's infatuation with Sansa has never been shown in all its blatant ambiguity, show watchers can speculate if he feels like a daddy replacement, an older brother or if he is in love with her. But there never was that brutal sexual assault with knife at throat. So that ugly  outburst of the dying man when he hears about Sansa's marriage and has to assume that Tyrion fucked her would come totally out of nowhere for show viewers, there was never that violent raging sexuality towards Sansa. And it might appear as overly constructed if Sandor wants to move Arya into giving the gift of mercy to him. They already are kind of buddies now and may be more so later in the season, she won't hate him anymore enough to cherish his death. If the gift of mercy were truly mercy and not revenge she would do it out of kindness, twisted as that euthanasia may appear to us.
Only  I have always seen it as cowardice from Sandor's side if he needs a little girl for committing suicide, he should be man enough to do the deed himself. In that context he would not present that hateful outburst towards Sansa and Tyrion in order to make Arya kill him, he would just ask if he feels unable to take the responsibility for his own life himself.
Did Sandor have to spend a time out on the QI for story's sake? Yes, since I am quite sure that at some point of the story Martin was not at all sure that he wishes to bring Sandor back. Maybe the immense popularity of show Sandor will convince him to keep the Hound in the game for a badass finale later. Did Sandor have to do time on the QI for his character's sake? Maybe, if a "reformed" Sandor can be presented as study of someone who is not hypocrite when making a 180 degree turn with his life, at least I don't see him as future religious nutcase but as someone who might want to make a difference.
But show Sandor simply is a different character imo. He has those comedy aspects that are wonderfully on spot, not overdone but entirely within show characterization. But at the same time show Sandor lacks a bit of the inner torments, bordering to washing over his having killed Mycah and having been Lannister's willing executioner (just like Bronn: both are horrible human beings and yet we enjoy enjoying them), compared to book Sandor. Show Sandor is far less at odds with himself, far less being eaten by his inner ghosts, he is the laconic clever cynic with a heart of....what? And it is Arya that counts for him.

I read a really long interview with Rory (rolling stone, I think?) and he did say that the road trip with him and Arya continue some this season, and that he will be opening up to her.Â  I don't think he meant in a buddy, buddy type thing, but it will still be tension along with the budding reliance on each other.Â  I don't think it's much of problem, the differences from the book, being as they shortened their travel time before the Twins and even up to killing Polliver.Â  Anyway, from the interview with Rory, it does sound like a lot of The Hound's personal issues will be addressed, so the character may become closer to the book.Â  I'm not sure on how they will play the Sansa issue, but The Hound's issues themselves, seem to be coming.Â

Eeenteresting. Sounds like what we were sort of predicting. Based on the tavern scene, I'd happily watch an Arya and the Hound spin-off show; a great pairing. I'd be very surprised if the Sansa subject is broached much...last season he told Arya that he had saved Sansa at one point. However Rory's age I think would prohibit addressing any of the tension found in the books. There might be a couple lines that serve as fan service for book readers, but I doubt anything is going to be made super explicit.
567	Woman of War	2014-04-10	Hm, interesting, we will see.
So far I saw the possibility that Sandor and Arya may go separate ways with Sandor either truly dying or Arya simply leaving him without him being wounded and we lose sight of him for a while.
Actually the death scene was a really strong one, with all its ugliness, hatespeak and misery. Only I never got why a guy like Sandor would not be able to slit his own throat but needed a child to do the deed for him. Did he want to make Arya happy with the pleasure of killing him or simply get rid of his hatred for Tyrion and aggression/attraction towards Sansa?
But as you describe it, Lady Fevre Dream, we are back to the open question from the books: Sandor or no Sandor in the future
Casting for season five or six will tell us

I don't think anyone's age is stopping them. Most of the male actors are playing down in age, and they had Sansa respond quite positively to the thought of having sex with Loras last season.So if they wanted to keep going there with the book story, they certainly could. There are many of us who want to see it, too. Reviewers called it out as a Beauty and the Beast story, they called it out on the commentary for Blackwater, too, and GRRM said they went there on the show, there's something there (that wasn't there before, couldn't resist adding that).In the recent scene, there are hints, too. They cut from Sansa to Sandor. Arya asks, "Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?" And he answers really quickly, "No." Doesn't sound happy. In the books, he's going on and on about Sansa, he brings her up nearly a dozen times. She was on his mind, and it makes sense that she would be on the show, too.Arya knows the Brotherhood took his money, so why not just have her say that. Arya is talking about money, Sandor is talking about something else. Two things stand out, "from Joffrey" and "before you left" - and what did he do just before he left? He tried to get Sansa (Joffrey's betrothed at the time) to go with him, and he was a mess from the fire, and that didn't go so well. And he just left, he didn't make her go with him.Â Also, they didn't get into the rest, I don't think, because the PW hasn't happened yet, but they have to get into Sandor and Arya finding out what happened to Sansa.

569	Woman of War	2014-04-10	Are you suggesting that Arya has any idea that Sandor might be interested in Sansa? How could she, no way, she was gone from KL.
But even if Sandor had double thoughts about Arya's question - and of course he tried to take Joffrey's fiancA©e out of KL - we do not know show Sandor's motivations and they were for sure not full of that sexual aggression, they were kinder, not something that could be used to make Arya want to kill him.
So I still wonder how they want to play that dying scene with Arya refusing the gift of mercy - out of hatred or out of respect that has grown? Sandor so weak that he is unable to hold a knife and getting rid of himself on his own and yet Arya refuses? There will probably not be a Sansa speech in its painful agressive cruelty, it would more be a summary full of regret, if Sansa gets mentioned at all. HBO Sandor simply never considered raping Sansa.
570	Le Cygne	2014-04-10	Just throwing out some text, here...The official app says this:Â "Riding with King Robert to Winterfell, Sandor first meets Sansa Stark and becomes infatuated with her..."During the Battle of the Blackwater, Clegane leads a force attempting to hold the King's Gate, but is unable to fulfill his duties due to his fear of the burning wildfire raging on the river and on the docks. Instead, he finds his way to Sansa Stark's chambers, where he forces her to sing him a song while trying to work up the courage to take her with him out of the city. Her fear of him -- as well as her song -- makes him leave without her..."Arya considers killing him, and the Hound attempts to force her into it by telling her how he killed Mycah and how he made Sansa sing for him."So it's about making her sing while trying to work up the courage to take her with him, and later, the relevant point is the same. And he didn't take her with him. And these bad things happened to her. And that's why he's sobbing. Pretty straightforward, right from the text.In the books, he just heard Sansa got married, and reacted pretty strongly to the news. He hopes Cersei will torture Tyrion ("She ought to dip him in wildfire and cook him. Or tickle him till the moon turns black.") Then the wound gets infected, and he's feverish, and he tries to get Arya to give him the gift of mercy. He's still worried about Sansa, and he starts sobbing, and says he should have done more to protect her. Then he says the line about Tyrion raping Sansa, he blames himself for not taking her with him. He could have spared her this ("before leaving her for that dwarf").Books and show, Sandor hates rapists, he calls them rats ("A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats"). In the show, he just saved Arya from rapists, and in the books and show, he saved Sansa from rapists, and he tells Arya about it. Sansa wishes he was there when she's afraid of rapists, Blackwater, she thinks "I would be gladder if it were the Hound... Harsh as he was, she did not believe Sandor Clegane would let any harm come to her," and Marillion, she thinks Sandor is there to save her again, "It was Lothor Brune's voice, she realized. Not the Hound's, no, how could it be?" Books and show have made it clear, Sandor is not a rapist.(added some more quotes)

@le Cygne
I guess half of the men at KL stared at Sansa's breast and fantazised about her naked, and so did Sandor.
Are you suggesting that Arya knew about Sandor's special interest in Sansa? How could she?
And yes, Sandor did indeed try to steal Joffreys fiancA©e but the show leaves the reason for it quite open: he cares for her but how? He may genuinely have wanted to protect her, he may have liked and fancied her but there never was that sexual aggression towards her like in the books. And now making that ugly hateful confession and rapewish towards Arya would be kind of artificial, out of context. I guess there would more be some sad regret, I fancied your sister, so what.....certainly not something Arya would want to kill him for, if he mentions Sansa at all.
So how would he try to get Arya to kill him and  why? Show Sandor never intended to rape Sansa. I mean he could simply send Arya away and rid himself of himself by his own hand, somehow he does not strike as lacking the courage for it. If  the hatred between Arya and Sandor has been diluted and  any hatespeak of Sansa is out of the story - how do that parting scene?
In your last post you gave your very personal interpretation of what Sansa thinks about Sandor but how would this influence the parting scene of Sandor and Arya? The show can only use what has already happened in the show. And there Sandor may have or not loving memories of Sansa but no aggressive ones that may Make Arya kill him. Or it would be a completely fabricated hatespeech from a dying man.

572	JonDunn	2014-04-10	I honestly think this is one of the best scenes of the series. Â Very cinematic. Â The dialogue was crackling, and as good as the Hound and Arya were, it needs to be said that Polliver was excellent too.
Â 
His line of 'torture, torture, torture, torture' had me cracking up.Â

Â 
Has GRRM or anyone ever said that Sandor really was considering raping her?Â  Unless George says that is the absolute truth, for the time being as I read it...........I don't think he wanted to rape her.Â  I think he wanted her to come with him, yes, and perhaps hoped for something.Â  All that rage about rape and Sansa in the 'mercy' scene with Arya was about Sandor trying to anger Arya into killing him.Â  Perhaps the actual idea of screaming rape or the idea of attempted rape came from his own sexual feelings about Sansa along with his fear that Tyrion did exactly that to Sansa, but I for one never thought he wanted to rape Sansa that night.Â  He wanted to have sex with her, either then or some day, but the whole 'rape speech' to Arya was, IMO unless GRRM says otherwise, him trying to egg Arya on into killing him.
Â 
I could be wrong, I get that, but I just thought it was more so about Sandor's complex feelings for Sansa, his fear that she really was raped by Tyrion, and his desire to force Arya to kill him.Â

That's why I quoted from the official app, that went throught GRRM, and it's about making her sing while trying to work up the courage to rescue her (take her with him) and he also made that clear in the script. Also, when he described the difference between the show and book scene, he said he made her sing in the books. That's all.Also, there's a really nice line in the books, there's a progression showing how much it bothered him to see her beaten, and how he felt he'd failed her by standing there in his white cloak and letting them do it. He really couldn't have done more than he did, which was give her advice, try to head Joffrey off from doing it, and help her afterwards, but that he blamed himself is pretty revealing. He said this, which I thought was good, "No one would hurt you again."So add that to all that he tried to do, and "Enough" and "Fuck the king" and then later, bringing it up repeatedly to Arya. After the Beric fight, "I watched them beat your sister bloody too" - that's him saying he failed her. And then he tells Arya, "I never beat your sister." And then finally (rule of three), he says, "I stood there in my white cloak and let them beat her" while sobbing. That's his dying regret, that he didn't protect her better.Also the "I hate gutless frauds" line - he's talking about himself there. He regrets not doing more for Sansa.

Â 
Thanks, I've never been up on all the SSMs around here.Â  That's always been my take on the scenes, but wasn't exactly sure.
Â 
I'm sure some of the issues with Sansa and Sandor will come up, especially being as we've had PigBoy Polliver look at even Arya in a sexual manner.Â  I love the hell out of Rory as The Hound, but I wonder if his age in comparison to Sophie's will effect things in a severe manner.Â  He does seem older than the Hound.Â  Granted, they don't give him an age in the show really, but I think it's obvious that Rory himself is older than Sandor, or it seems that way to me, maybe I'm wrong?Â 
Â 
ETA:Â  Those are good observations on the show, too.Â  All the new FUCK THE KING from him is telling, that and I do agree, as I've seen posted previously that the comment about not stealing from Joffrey was not taking Joff's betrothed with him.Â

There is that intentional parallel of Tyrion and Sandor in the books, both did not in the end but considered it at some point - just as it has been mitigated in both cases by HBO. And that cooling down in both cases makes it difficult to establish the emotions in both cases. Martin wanted to parallel the two men.
And I do not really get at all why Sandor would have wanted to provoke Arya into killing him. He could have done it himself. Did he want that karmic punishment by Sansa's sister since he knew quite well about the evil intentions he had in the books? He need not have them in HBO though. And then there may be no provocation. How will Arya and Sandor part then?

But I think Rory is playing down in age, like most of the male actors.
578	Karmarni	2014-04-10	That torture line from Polliver, both Arya and Sandor know exactly what that meant from Gregor and his men. The camera shows both their faces and we know what must be going through their minds. I think that will play a part later.
No, never saw Sandor as a rapist and neither does Jaime in his ADwD thoughts. The show is all about the difference between the Clegane brothers. Sandor is shouting that out to the Brotherhood in his pre-trial speech. Couldn't be plainer. Also, pretty certain he won't die. No book spoiler on that one. And foreshadowed on the show with the "Have you found god?" sneer and the "Go in peace, Sandor Clegane" from Beric. 
As for the dying request for mercy, all the Hound has to do is say he failed to protect Sansa, that he meant to steal her. And his regret for Mycah. That Arya in the books says she can't even recall him that much is just GRRM highlighting how regretful Sandor must be. Perhaps he angers her in other ways on the show. They aren't playing by the books 100% obviously. Arya has had a few lines that seem to suggest she herself wishes she had cared more for Sansa, I recall the delivery of her line to Ja'qen. 
And just for the record, I too think Sandor went to her room to take her with him. That he asked for Florian and Jonquil because that's the song she said she'd sing. Even though he initially was talking about 'singing' in the ASOIAF slang way. At Blackwater, she couldn't look at him. Angered him, and so he went for a real song. It was all he was going to get and then he must've assumed he'd never see her again. He does that in the same way as in Dunk and Egg. He cries because he's leaving. 
The show Hound looked pretty sad to leave her too. I am pretty certain they'll go there with that.
579	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-10	I thought the dialogue was weird and kinda lame. I know its not a popular opinion. I enjoyed the scene during the show, loved the whole episode, but I didn't get the chicken joke. I also guess I was expecting a more heated confrontation like in the novels.


That's funny - I thought the setup and aftermath were tremendous but the fight itself was both horribly conceived and executed.
Â 
The shaky handheld camera made it difficult to follow the action and made me nauseous. Â It was confusing to see Arya stand there doing nothing for 90% of the brawl (did she think that things would have ended well for her after they killed the Hound??). Â Sandor is fighting with 3 guys at once but rather than finish any of them off he knocks each them to the ground, allowing them to recover and overtake him. Despite being flat on his back on the ground, he suddenly morphs to his feet and pops into frame from out of nowhere to step on a guy's sword and punch him in the face.
Â 
Then we have my favorite part: despite having rather easily handled these guys in 2-on-1 and 3-on-1 situations, Sandor finds himself 1-on-1 with the smallest of the bunch - so of course the guy takes him to the ground with almost no effort at all. Â Luckily for the Hound, however, the guy decides not to kill him but rather rest the blade of his knife on Sandor's neck while he recovers. Â He pushes the guy's head away, which accomplishes nothing as the knife blade is still easily within range of his neck, but eventually the Hound regains the upper hand.
Â 
A little pokey pokey to the face, Arya finally wakes up, executes the weirdest and slowest stabbing in the history of sword fighting, and our good friend Polliver decides to ignore the loud smashing of the vase and screaming of his friend being killed 8 feet behind him and take a very casual stroll in the opposite direction. Â He's slashed from behind, falls face first to the ground, is unable to scramble away but manages to flip onto his back to facilitate a close up and some dialogue with his killer.
Â 
I read someone describe it as "amateur hour" and I couldn't agree more.
580	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-10	I think at some point Sandor wanted to rape Sansa, only he did not.

Â 
I'm not sure that I get why he wanted Arya to do it either, some people, regardless of the many other type of things they do, are just chicken (not intended to be a pun, but, LOL) when it comes to killing themselves.Â  Perhaps even a part of him wanted to hear Arya dispute that he deserved to die.
Â 
I don't deny that Sandor wanted her, but I do think his overall rough manner gets interpreted the wrong way, not saying you specifically.Â  Regardless of his speech, I take him to be the equivalent of a "Shitmouth," he talks a nasty game but I wouldn't be surprised if his POV in his own mind was quite different.Â

Â 
I think they haven't told us his age on the show and they are or will play his age down, ITA.Â  I'm not even sure how old Rory is, but just by old pictures of him, and various things I've picked up in interviews, I'd say it's definately not 29, LOLÂ
582	Chebyshov	2014-04-10	Rory is 44. I think if Sansa and Sandor was going to be a thing they would have cast younger. 15 years in Westeros standards isn't that much, so you could see that pairing happen eventually. But the actors are what, 26 years apart?
Â 
Maybe D&D want Sansa's storyline to go in a different direction, or maybe when the cast for the pilot episode they didn't even think to check if the Hound was going to end up with someone. It will be interesting to see if/how Show!Sansa is discussed between the Hound and Arya for the rest of the season, though.

But his story is sooo much more interesting if he oscillated between rough sexual agression and paternal protection than if he only was her true knight, as HBO chose to interpret it. Just like the original wedding night chapter of Sansa and Tyrion was so much more complex than what HBO could, for obvious reasons, Sansa's age and no boner, present.

Sandor hoped that he in a way had won Arya over, he had started to respect her and wanted to be valued by her.
Edit: I love the dynamics of those two characters.

Â 


Â 
I really, really do think that Sandor respected the hell out of Arya, and I've always thought that he did want to hear her say:Â  I had you all wrong.Â  He may have even been willing to kill himself then, so I'm grateful Arya was well, Arya.Â  I love the Hound and Arya dynamics as much, if not moreso, than the one with Sansa.
Â 
I do think Sandor was fighting urges, and who knows, with how drunk he was, he might have even scared himself.Â  He might have been afraid he couldn't control himself.Â  But, things like rape are one of his hot button issues, it's obvious how much he hates to see abuse,Â he hates to see power used to hurt others, just for the jollies.Â 
Â 
I think they will get into some of the romance/love issues with Sansa and Sandor.Â  I have no idea of the true endgame ofÂ anything in the books, but........perhaps the age thing with Rory shows us that he may not be her end game, romantically.Â Â It's all the inbetween that we'll have to wait for, books and show.Â  IÂ HATE WAITING, LOLÂ  Â 
Â 
ETA:Â  I do think lots of things have been changed because of Sophie's true age.Â  I think even the laws are stricter now with actors and certain sexual scenes than they were years ago.Â  It's strange, with HBO's boobfest being always present, and the expectation of such things with sex or almost sex scenes or scenes of a sexual nature, might be what has led to some of these changes.Â  No boobs, no..........book scene?Â  No peen shown to a minor?Â  nvrmind, it could be that simple.Â 
Â 
ETA:Â  Excuse typing and grammar, taking care of sick hubby inbetween posting.Â

Hell, that ALMOST made me forget about Needle.Â  Almost.Â  I loved how Arya added that 'my brother gave me that sword.'Â  I suppose Jon Snow and The Wall will come up between Arya and Sandor.Â  Afterall, they have to try the Lysa idea, give up on it, and maybe even, play father and daughter at a village somewhere?Â  I can't wait.Â

Â 
I like age gaps myself.Â  Â Â  I FINALLY figured out who Rory McCann reminds me of...........Sean Connery, just not as good looking.Â  Speaking of age gaps, I hated Sean Connery when I was real young (blame my father and James Bond movie marathons, LOL), and it wasn't til he was much older that I thought he was good looking.Â  Connery was much more handsome as an older man.Â  Rory looks like he could be his cousin, especially when I see him without the Hound wig.Â

590	Le Cygne	2014-04-10	I like age gaps myself.Â  Â Â  I FINALLY figured out who Rory McCann reminds me of...........Sean Connery, just not as good looking.Â  Speaking of age gaps, I hated Sean Connery when I was real young (blame my father and James Bond movie marathons, LOL), and it wasn't til he was much older that I thought he was good looking.Â  Connery was much more handsome as an older man.Â  Rory looks like he could be his cousin, especially when I see him without the Hound wig.Â Â And, soon, Sophie will be of age, if she's not already, LOLShe's 18. She's in a new movie with a 40 something costar. Something between them, too.Sean Connery, oh, my, fans self. He's ageless. Cary Grant, too.

Thank you.Â  His age looks hard to peg, but I knew it wasn't 29.Â 


What I find funny is they have a 44 year old actor playing someone who should be in his twenties in the books, but is in his thirties in the show while the new New Mountain is 25 in RL so he is 20 years younger than his 'younger' brother.

Â 
Â 
As far as The Mountain, I just give up, LOLÂ  I'm just hoping this one comes off like the one from the first season and a bit of the books.
Â 
I don't have a problem with recasting when absolutely necessary.Â  It's a shame how much The Mountain's character has suffered, I do wonder how much of his ominous presence non readers really feel.Â  One character I wish that they had recast was The Great Jon.Â  I think it was important to show that Robb, first off, still had fiercely loyal and supportive bannermen, and well, I think his presence was greatly missed for that and the RW.Â  Considering that The Great Jon is still a prisoner of the Frey family and being used to blackmail half of the North, I wonder if that's a problem that D&D will pay for, later on.Â
593	Lord Spark of House Spark	2014-04-10	I thought the scene was done pretty damn well, however I'm on board with the "psychotic repeating of questions while brutually stabbing him" being more impactful. The problem is they basically took two great revenge kills from Arya (The Tickler & Raff) and morphed them into 1. It was a good scene, but it all goes back to why the hell did they have to kill the Tickler??? Just sucks that the best part of the TWOW Mercy sample chapter is now eliminated from the show. Oh well, still quite the scene.Â

Oh well, still quite the scene.I am ok with this version since it mirrors the TWOW Mercy chapter, which is almost Shakespearian in George's development.The show had already framed Arya's actions here in Season 2, and I was guessing all along it would play out this way since Raff was never a character.I too do puzzle why they made the Tickler the torturer at Harrenhal , it could have been almost any new character they wanted.In fact don't know why they even had Ian Whyte as The Mountain, season 2, biggest casting bungle they ever made.I can see why they had to condense and modify Arya's stay at Harrenhal, that worked out fine, but the Tickler thing is odd.O well it's a nit anyway.

Really, the problem isn't even that they killed the Tickler, it's that they combined Polliver (the guy who stole the sword) and Raff (the guy who killed Lommy). If they hadn't done that Arya could have done the same to Polliver as she did to the Tickler.
596	Quentyn Kartell	2014-04-10	Show Arya avenging Lommy never gave me the chills that book Arya killing the Tickler or 
	Spoiler Raff the sweetling

I agree. The fact that they left out arya's prior killings seems to put too much character development into one scene.
597	boojam	2014-04-10	I agree. The fact that they left out arya's prior killings seems to put too much character development into one scene.Well... she 'killed' the fat boy at KL, and the killing of the Frey soldier was a substitute for the Harrell guard.So by the tavern she has killed two as in the books.In the show she killed two at the tavern, so we are even with killings in the book, even tho it's different people.
598	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-10	Rory talking to Rolling Stone, said "Some of the lines they've given The Hound this year are incredible".
Â 
On the tavern scene:
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>When I had to drink in that tavern scene, thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s David and Dan going â<U+0080><U+009C>Give him another beer! Fill it right up to the top! Can you down another?â<U+0080><U+009D> I was really fit at the time, wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t drinking, working out, there was definitely no sugar in my body â<U+0080><U+0094> and suddenly I had six or seven liters of flat ginger beer that day. I had to go off into the woods to make myself sick. They had this new helper, I didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know who he was, and they told him â<U+0080>Weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve lost the Hound! Weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve lost the Hound!â<U+0080><U+0099> Â Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m on my hands and knees with my fingers down my throat trying to get this bloody soda out of me. He came up like, â<U+0080>Are you â<U+0080><U+0094> â<U+0080> Â [growls] â<U+0080>FUCK OFF!â<U+0080><U+0099> [Laughs] He ran away into the woods. [high-pitched, scared helper voice] â<U+0080>He told me to fuck off!â<U+0080><U+0099>â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
Delving a bit more into who The Hound is this year:
Â 
My audition was a scene of the Hound describing to Sansa how he got his burned face. It happens in the book, and they were gonna film it in the first episode: "Look at me â<U+0080><U+0094> this is the reason I am the way I am." Then they decided not to do it. David pushed Dan into my trailer, and I was like, "Why are you pushing the wee guy in? You got something to say?" "We decided we want to bring you in gentler. We don't want you to talk about yourself at the moment. But don't worry!" I go "You're bruising my ego. You're not...firing me?" "No, no, we're not firing you! We're just gonna bring you in slower." It's taken four fucking years, but here we go. [Laughs] That's what's happening. I'm gonna open up this time. The Hound's gonna speak freely.
Â 
On Maisie:
Â 

She's just such a good actress! Really clever, really bright, she knows everythingâ<U+0080>¦she's a real help to me, because I'm a bit goofy and a bit daft. I forget where I am in the story and she knows my lines, my story, where we are, what's going on, the reason we're there. I get in trouble for pulling faces, and she keeps me in check. The great thing is, I don't think she realizes how good she is yet â<U+0080><U+0094> so don't tell her.

Â 
It's a great interview, for those interested:

The killing of the Frey soldier was not a substitute for the Harenhall guard. The key point about that killing was that this was not a killing in self defence, or of an enemy and someone she was angry with, but the killing of someone who just happened to be in her way.

When eating "every fucking chicken in the room," it is advised to remove ones shirt to avoid staining it with offending grease (excerpt from "How to Win Friends and Be a Total Bad Ass" byÂ Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan).
Â 
I'm not sure the Harrenhal guard was self-defense per say, but I would describe it as a crime of necessity - as opposed to the Frey guard which was one of opportunity. Â Having said that, the Harrenhal guard was deliberate whereas the Frey guard was more of an emotional response.
Â 
So I'm not sure exactly where that leaves us (or Arya)...Â

I'm pretty sure in the Maisie/Rory interview on this site that Maisie said that Arya doesn't ask questions about Sansa because she doesn't want the Hound to know she cares. So it seems that any mention of Sansa will need to come from the Hound.
Â

Â That may be logically true but it is still a big step to kill some blameless soldier, nominally at that point an ally, to get out.
Â 
That is the big character development Arya hasn't had yet. She has killed in the heat of the moment, or those who are her enemies, but not someone who just happens to be in her way.
Â 
If they do bring this in it would be quite a big step for a TV show. The writers of Dexter for example were very reluctant to ever having himÂ kill in those circumstances and that was a drama about a serial killer.

Â True, but Dexter's backdrop played more my our rules, while Westeros lives in the context of very different rules. I think we will see Arya killing people who just happen to be in her way.

Â 
Â 
Yeah, I don't know what they're going to do later, when they need Raff.
Perhaps they can use a Frey - there's so many of them.
Â 
Â

Maybe he was reminiscing about Sansa, and subconsciously began taking his shirt off?

637	boojam	2014-04-13	When the hell is Arya getting new clothes? She's been wearing the same damn outfit since the start of season two. That's like two years in the show, those clothes must stink something fierce.Seems I remember S1E10 she was still dressed as she was when Yoren cut her hair.She was still wearing her Syrio practice clothes.Which were kind of androgynous.Never explained on the show, maybe in the book?, where her new clothes came from, because by season 2 there were making her look more boyish.I remember an interview with Maisie for season 2 where she said some of her clothes came from a dead man ... he must have been short!Maisie just does not grow very fast [there is even a remark in season 2 with Dance about that ].I can't believe she will be that short in 2 more years.I think they do have to refit her outfit for the fact that she now has the physic of a 15 year old.The show still does try to make her look younger than her actual real world age.Sort of works for her.But not for Sophie Turner or Isaac Hempstead Wright.I still think D&D should slip some 'time passes' in the show and just ditch the book's age deal.

Agreed. Â Tyrion and Bronn talked about Sansa's age and the most specific they got was that she's younger than anyone Tyrion has ever been with, which seemed to me to get the point across. Â  I don't know what the value was in having her explicitly tell him later on that she's 14 - all that did was take me out of the scene because it's clearly not true.
640	Conchobar	2014-04-13	I don't seem to remember any of Polliver's men with armor, but one may of had partial armor.
Heck a couple didn't even seem to have 'boiled' leather.


The first one the Hound killed had the standard Lannister plate armour on.
641	Le Cygne	2014-04-13	In the books, Sansa answered differently, since her name day was days away, she said almost the age she would be, in the case of show Sansa, 15. Another interesting thing, in one of the promos, Cersei calls Dany a child, and she's around 20 in the story, GRRM said she started it at 18, and it's been about 2 years. Jaime called Brienne a child in the books, too, and she was around 18 at the time. It's a relative term.This picture shows Polliver's leather as red. In the scene, when he said the King's colors, I was thinking, brown?http://i.imgur.com/WJzLUNJ.jpg

643	Le Cygne	2014-04-13	I think Dany was 16 at the beginning of Season 1.They had to make Dany 18 to show the nudity:Â They didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have this concept of adolescence or the teenage years. You were a child or you were an adult. And the onset of sexual maturity meant you were an adult. So I reflected that in the books. But then when you go to film it you run into people going crazy about child pornography and thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s actual laws about how you canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t depict a 13 year old having sex even if you have an 18 year old acting the part â<U+0080><U+0094> itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s illegal in the United Kingdom. So we ended up with a 22 year old portraying an 18 year old, instead of an 18 year old portraying a 13 year old. If we decided to lose the sex we could have kept the original ages.Â http://shelf-life.ew...e-with-dragons/

The armour still looks brown to me.
645	aussiegirl	2014-04-13	According to Maisie Williams herself, she is 5ft1. She grew 1 inch in the last year.Â She has more than likely reachedÂ her adult height as only guys tend to grow more in their late teens.
Â 
In the show they can use the 'no makeup' look to make her look slightly younger. She can probably pass for around 14/15 in theÂ show because of the raggedy clothes and overall scruffy look.
Â 
But as herself, she looks her age. It will be interesting to see how they dress her when she finally gets rid of those clothes.
Â 
As for any haircuts, they aren't necessary as the show stopped trying to pass her off as a boy long ago.
646	Colonel Green	2014-04-13	I don't know what the value was in having her explicitly tell him later on that she's 14


Because Sansa being that young is essentially the only objection to the union that the show was willing to allow.
647	The Monkey	2014-04-14	I think Dany was 16 at the beginning of Season 1.


Well, Robert and Cersei's marriage was said to have lasted 17 years, which means the war probably took place 18 years before the start of the series. So that means that Dany, Jon and Robb were all 18 at the start of the series.

Do you mean 16 years? Â (16 years + 1 Season = 17)
Â 
In the books, Dany was still in her mother's womb when she and Viserys fled Westeros. Â In the show, she made a comment (I believe to the Spice King) about not having been in Westeros since she was very young, so she's at least the length of Robert/Cersei's marriage prior to the start of the show + the length of Robert's Rebellion + however many months/years she was alive before that. Â Jon and Robb would be roughly the same.
649	boojam	2014-04-15	Because Sansa being that young is essentially the only objection to the union that the show was willing to allow.I don't know why D&D did not think that thru.Peter, just because of his personality has brought a different Tyrion to the show (I know book purists don't like that, but I am fine with it, a reader but not a purist, me).So the GOT Tyrion was disgusted with the whole forced marriage, viewed Sansa in a sympathetic light , just had a more compassionate approach to her than in the books, tho there was some of that in the books too.So drop the age thing and go with that I would buy it in a heartbeat.
650	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-05-17	this is probably one of my favorite scenes in the show so far. i was laughing my ass off for the first half of the scene, then the fight was really great.
651	Talking Hodor	2014-06-04	So we can assume Sandor will not be headed to the Quiet Ilse?


He's destined to link up with some cunt named Hot Pie and found a restaurant chain, Colonel Sandor's Krispy Fried Chicken.
652	Wee baby Shamus	2014-08-23	CHICKENS!!!!
653	Ser Hugh BuckweII	2014-04-07	In ASOS, the hound is gravely wounded in the tavern fight, which leads to Arya leaving him and going to Bravos. What do you think will happen now that we can see his injuries aren't as bad as they are in the book?
654	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	I think there will another fight coming.
655	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-07	The Hound makes it and never becomes the silent giant.
Â 
Fingers crossed. Maybe he travels with Arya to Bravos. Wouldn't that be something.

Â

while that'd be a Gigantic deviation. Wouldn't be totally opposed to it as i love the pairing.
Â 
Â 
Anyway,just cause Â he doesn't immediately show signs of injury doesn't mean one didn't happen. Maybe he gets a really nasty cut that gets all infected.
657	zaphodbrx	2014-04-07	Well, their book stuff is mostly done. Except for the end with the coin and all, but that'll probably be in ep 10.
Â 
So in between it will all be fanfiction/filler. Maybe they'll run into Blackfish, or something else stupid.
658	Tooms	2014-04-07	The Hound makes it and never becomes the silent giant.

Personally I think Arya needs to do that journey alone, but it could potentially ruin a future plot line also!

Indeed. I don't think they'd do anything that drastic. They're still trying to represent the books as best they can.
660	Ahri Adaran	2014-04-07	Yeah fanfiction filler ahoy! However just like with the QoT's filler last year it should be fun filler so no complaints.
661	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-07	He did get kicked a bunch, didn't he? Â Perhaps some internal injuries take their toll as the season rolls on?
Â 
The Hound and Bronn are my favorite parts of the show right now - I'm in no hurry for Sandor go to anywhere.
Â 
But if he does, at least he has chicken...
662	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-07	Yeah I think another fight will happen mid season with some other King's men, possibly with Rorge and Biter to refresh the viewers on who they are before the Brienne incident. The Hound gets wounded (possibly bitten) in THAT tussle, and Arya's journey progresses solo from there. I think that would be a good call if they are doing that as although The Hound/Arya relationship is great, there's not much going on Â between the tavern fight and Arya going to Braavos.

Â 
Arya's whole story is about how, one by one, she loses everyone she puts any trust in and is alone and has to carve her own way.

664	Konradsmith	2014-04-07	Watch the weapons featurette from a week or two ago. You see a bloodied Sandor in what looks to beÂ a Vale-like setting. Either they fight the Knights of the Vale or they help the KOTV fight somebody...maybe Hill Tribes or Rorge and co.
665	Blazfemur	2014-04-07	it can still end up identical outcome. remember when sandor is wounded and arya tends to him, and he practically begs for her to kill him?
Â 
what if on the show, arya stabs him with needle, arya takes the initiative, then leaves him there bleeding out
666	Blazfemur	2014-04-07	it ends up being the same outcome, it makes arya look relentless and twisted, and also makes sandor kinda look like the victim, building him up slightly
667	BlueDragon	2014-04-08	Sandor cannot become a faceless man for about a zillion reasons, not the least of his extraordinary size although we don't have a good comparison for that because of the way the scenes are shot.
Â 
And no one can just walk up and say, "hey guys I want to join you"
Â 
He is against all elites of any kind and he would see the faceless man as part of just another pretentious elite.
Â 
they wouldn't accept him because they wouldn't think he was sharp enough.
Â 
Arya's trick played about kill yourself, plus her courage concerning letting them out of the cage after standing up to them
668	Mr Smith	2014-04-08	Things will probably go down more or less the same way by the end of the season, there's plenty of dangers they can run into. Having said that, I wouldn't put it past them changing it up, and wouldn't really mind keeping the Hound in the game a little longer.
Â 
Sandor going with Arya to Braavos is as stupid as it is counterproductive.

This is more than just speculation. There's strong evidence for it, and Martin himself has stated that offscreen deaths are often not deaths at all. This is one of the few theories I take as gospel truth.
669	WiDMNDBAMMD	2014-04-08	Man it really sucks how they changed the books and can't go back to those chapters they skipped with Arya, just like they couldn't go back half a book with Tyrion to let him meet the Red Viper.................
Â 
in all seriousness is anyone complaining that The Hound will have at least one more fight than the books? I mean I enjoy reading about him chopping wood, but I really enjoy watching him beat the shit out of people.

670	protar	2014-04-08	I'm guessing that The Hound's plan to bring Arya to the Vale will be more fully realised in the show. Rather than just turning away at the first sign of snows, they'll manage to sneak into the Vale but be waylaid by Knights who Lysa's tasked with protecting the Vale's borders from the war.Â
671	Romby	2014-04-08	I book 2 Aryas pov was used to show how the war effected the smallfolk. They didnÂ´t have time for this in season 2, since Arya had lots to do with her little band and harenhall story (and a dragon kidnapping taking up a lot of time).
Â 
The end of the episode is a view of the riverlands burning. I think we might get some Arya book 2 like scenes. Dont think the hound was hurt in the fight. Might happen later. Perhaps the village he helps in the vale will be attacked by raiders.
672	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-08	Sandor is not going to travel with Arya, i'd be against that for so many reasons even though I love him and dont want him to go.

676	JagLover	2014-04-08	I very much doubt the hound will travel to Bravoos with Arya.

Â 
Â

Seeing as Arya is currently spending at least parts of three separate books on Braavos, I think it's clear that it's far too important a part of her arc to skip. Not even D+D would do that I would hope.Â

If this is going to go seven seasons they are going to need to cut some storylines. Â Arya turning evil first and then learning from a Faceless Man while still in Westeros might save a lot of screen time.

Â 
I could have sword we saw Braavos in the season previews, but either way, I doubt they'd change that. Personally, I Â just think that they just need more filler for her plot this season, so they're going to wait a little before wounding the Hound. Arya's AFFC and ADWD chapters have enough for one season, but not really more than that. Also, Â if the Hound is wounded up closer to the Eyrie, there's the added factor that once again, Arya is almost reunited with family (this time Sansa), but misses her chance (I'm assuming without really knowing it).
685	AnotherCrannogman	2014-04-08	If we see Bravos then I am wrong. That just makes her reaction in episode one more confusing as there is no need to make her a cold killer immediately.
686	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-08	I don't think it is confusing.Â 
Â 
She has been through a lot in 3 seasons, then witnessed the Red Wedding. Its high time for the 'list' to start to get shorter, and she did the stabby blood lust frustration venting last season.
687	Jojosh	2014-04-08	I wouldn't mind arya and the hound hanging out a bit longer just to stretch her eventual journey to bravos

We will see Braavos. In the trailer we see the impressive looking Titan.
689	HelenaExMachina	2014-04-08	I think they will get to the Mountains of the Moon village as in the books. Deviation will be that mountain clansman attack the village, Sandor is badly injured.
Arya leaving him.will be difficult I think. They seem closer than they are the book, which would surely mean she would grant him the gift of mercy.

She becomes a cold killer later than she does in the books. She kills the guard at Harrenhal at the end of ACOK. And Braavos is already confirmed anyway.

First time post from a long-time lurker, de-cloaking to say that this is precisely what I'm really worried about. Â As a firm believer in the Gravedigger theory, if Arya does divert from the story in the show, and does give him the Gift instead of riding off... it seems to me that would carry some heavy implications for any future (theorized) involvement Sandor might have in the books.
It's my hope she finds she can't do it... but because she's come to care for him.
If she gives him an on-screen death, I will cry ALL of the crocodile tears. Â I'll probably keep reading and watching, but I'll hate myself for it, LOL ;o)

Â 
The show loves teasing the audience with the 'could be' Stark reunions and I think they'll play that up. The possibility of Arya and Sansa getting back together will excite many people, especially with the Hound being there too- he seems to have a soft spot for both Stark girls, all though in different ways. They had Littlefinger tell Sansa he had seen Arya after all- teasing with 'future plot' references.Â 
Â 
I'm betting many Unsullied will think the Hound will become their protector as they avenge their family.Â

The Vale storyline doesn't work at all.Â  The Hound KNOWS Lysa from his time at King's Landing.Â  He knows she's a nut.Â  He may not be the smartest guy in the story but he's gotta know there's nothing there.
Â 
There was also a problem I had with one of his and Arya's exchanges.Â  She asked him why he didn't have any money.Â  She knows the Brotherhood stole his gold.Â  She was there when he complained about it.Â  So she already knows why he doesn't have any money.

Welcome, Vespaer.Â  
I couldn't help but get chilled to the bone when watching those last few seconds with Arya.Â  Not only the cold smile, but her face seemed shadowed, as if her inner rage had finally been transformed into murderous, calculating darkness.Â  To me, once she slowly forced Needle into Polliver's neck she stopped being Ned's little girl, and is now well on her way to becoming a 'faceless man/woman'.Â 
Since the popularity of Arya and the Hound are at an all time high, they most likely won't get rid of Sandor until the last episode, and even then it will be her walking away while he screams/yells/begs for her 'gift'.Â  I'm already stocking up on tissues.Â Â

However it would not surprise me if Â given his fan favourite status they have something more in mind for him than one brief scene with Brienne as a grave digger.
Â 
Â 


Â Well, we have only seen to this point that one scene - I think based on what some of the theories are that we will see him further down the road but that he would need to disappear for a while.
Â 


I think they will get to the Mountains of the Moon village as in the books. Deviation will be that mountain clansman attack the village, Sandor is badly injured.
Arya leaving him.will be difficult I think. They seem closer than they are the book, which would surely mean she would grant him the gift of mercy.


Â I don't think it will be that difficult - she still very much resents him for Mycah.Â  Yes, their on screen chemistry is great, but I don't think there is a lot of softness of her towards him.
697	protar	2014-04-08	Â 
The Vale storyline doesn't work at all.Â  The Hound KNOWS Lysa from his time at King's Landing.Â  He knows she's a nut.Â  He may not be the smartest guy in the story but he's gotta know there's nothing there.
Â 
There was also a problem I had with one of his and Arya's exchanges.Â  She asked him why he didn't have any money.Â  She knows the Brotherhood stole his gold.Â  She was there when he complained about it.Â  So she already knows why he doesn't have any money.


Â 
Lysa wasn't quite so nutty before Jon died. And it's not like The Hound would care. He just drops off Arya, takes the money and leaves. It's his only real shot at getting anywhere at the moment. The point about the money is a good one though. Bit of a mess up there from D+D.
698	SeventySeven	2014-04-08	For all amount of fanfiction the show has added, they didn't really change any of the main outcomes yet, so I would be surprised if Sandor ended up travelling to Braavos with Arya. They'll just add lots of filler scenes, and then go by the books.Â

Dude!

699	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-08	I imagine Sandor may still yet be injured. Perhaps Arya will do it herself. The fine details of the show often differ from the novels.

701	roxWolfox	2014-04-08	I'm not really aware of any added fanfiction in the tv show.Â  I found that a lot of the content of the books have been overlooked rather than the writers (George RR Martin included) adding to the televised version of the story.
Any examples?

Â 
I suppose the details of Theon's transformation to Reek could be considered that. Both Tywin and Mel meeting Arya. Talisa wasn't fanfiction so much as a complete deviation from the source material to be more suitable for the TV medium.
Â 
However, "fanfiction" is a bit harsh, seeing as they consult with Martin on everything, and he writes some episodes. I'd just consider it "adaptation for TV."
704	SeventySeven	2014-04-08	Fanfiction is an hyperbole.
Â 
However, I don't think grrm has as much a say as some seem to believe. He didn't like the Talisa thing, and asked them to change her name IIRC, In fact, I think the same thing happened to Locke/Vargo Hoat, when the characters are too different they need to become a new character. But other than that I'm sure the show doesn't rely on george for any decision.
705	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-04-08	he will get wounded in some later fight
706	ivor the swine	2014-04-08	We know they are heading for the Vale so maybe a mash-up with a band of Hill Tribesmen at some point will give The Hound a bit more screen time. Arya MUST go to Braavos alone.
707	roxWolfox	2014-04-08	Alright, I have a better understanding of 'fanfiction' now.Â  
Talisa - I actually liked her, keeping in mind that I'm an 'old fogey'.Â  Oona Chaplin's inclusion was brilliant in that her grandfather, Charlie Chaplin, was an icon, and her last name drew the immediate attention of those of us who loved 'old hollywood' and silent movie actors.Â  Kudos to D&D.Â  It also has potential to add to the backstory of Cersei's encounter with Maggy and her prophecy if they ever decide to include it, I guess.Â  Speculations abounded all over the place when my (also old fogey) friends and I discussed the ramifications of her (Talisa) being killed off.Â Â  XD
I may be the only one on this site that absolutely detested Theon's torture chapters, but having worked in shelters where women and children came in cut up and stitched up on a regular basis, I was constantly reminded of how much torture takes place in modern society...not something I read about or watch with relish.Â Â  The only thing I enjoyed about those scenes was the presence of my favourite Misfit, Simon.Â  The sausage scene was so freaking hilarious, though.Â Â 
For Arya with Tywin, rather than Roose.Â  OMG!Â  I bowed to Maisie Williams that night for holding her own against the great Charles Dance.Â  What a mind blowing/heart-stopping event that was for me.Â  I was on tenderhooks the entire time.Â  The Roose Bolton actor is great at being Roose and all...but nowhere nearly as intimidating an actor as Mr. Dance!Â Â  And Miss Williams held her own throughout.
Anyways, those were just my thoughts on the differences.Â  I gave up a long time ago on seeing any beloved books being transferred scene for scene, word for word on film.Â

Lysa wasn't quite so nutty before Jon died.Â 


Â 
Yeah?
Â 
Who killed Jon Arryn?
709	Peter George Stewart	2014-04-08	I like the idea someone mooted above: he will get injured, probably doing something fairly noble, and get a kind of redemption, but the irony will be that he asks Arya to give him a merciful release, but it will be painful for her to do so because she kind of likes him by then; but she'll still get to tick him off the list.Â 
Â 
That would fit with enough of what's needed to stay reasonably true to the book and keep the book ball rolling, while giving fan service re. another of these delightful pairings (e.g. Arya and Tywin, Jaimie and Brienne, Tyrion and Shae) that aren't necessarily all that canon, but get popular and get elaborated because of good acting chemistry.Â  (It's part of what GRRM said about a different medium requiring a certain adaptability re. the book stuff - you can't stick too rigidly to it, and if you have a good thing like good acting chemistry, it's more valuable to roll with it than ignore it for the sake of being utterly true to the book.)
Â 
She's got to get to Braavos, because it's such a cool city and the stuff she does is cool, and in the books it's clear she's being prepped for something that requires some genuine hardcore competence in the killing arts.
710	Mithras	2014-04-08	Their last scene looks like they were heading to razed and burnt villages which means the sacking of Saltpans. I think they might toss upon some Bloody Mummers and the Hound gets his wounds against them.
711	HelenaExMachina	2014-04-08	Noone else thinking its the Mountain Clans will get him and injure him?
712	protar	2014-04-08	Â 
Yeah?
Â 
Who killed Jon Arryn?


Â 
Well she did, which probably drove her pretty nutty. Even if she didn't like him much, that's a pretty big thing for a not very strong-willed person to do, and now she has to cope with the paranoia of being found out as well.
713	Blazfemur	2014-04-08	I hope her big scene comes this season, that would be awesome.
714	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-09	Yes, he will get injured another way. He has many potential ways to get injured soon.
715	JagLover	2014-04-09	If we see Bravos then I am wrong. That just makes her reaction in episode one more confusing as there is no need to make her a cold killer immediately.


Â She was a cold killer in the books even earlier.
Â 
the whole point about travelling to Bravoos is not to make her so, but to give her effective training.
716	Inv1ctus	2014-04-09	Agree with majority here, as much as I love the Hound I believe Arya has to travel to Braavos alone. Although as far as her storyline in the books goes, I really hope she doesn't complete the training and becomes the faceless woman, cause she would kind of completely lost her identity then. As far as show goes, obviously the little changes they make every season will start to accumulate and become bigger changes as show goes on. I think this is inevitable if they want to keep sort of a straight line in the show. I just hope that changes won't be something stupid like previously mentioned the Hound going to Braavos too.Â
717	Faceless Man Friday	2014-04-09	I'm guessing that The Hound's plan to bring Arya to the Vale will be more fully realised in the show. Rather than just turning away at the first sign of snows, they'll manage to sneak into the Vale but be waylaid by Knights who Lysa's tasked with protecting the Vale's borders from the war.Â 


I agree. Â We are about to watch a fantastic road trip that is not in the books. Â The trip will in many ways fulfill the same purpose of the trip Book Arya had with the Brotherhood, showing the devastation the war has caused the common folk, but in the end, Arya will leave him to die and head to Braavos.
718	Colonel Green	2014-04-09	Not to mention the obvious step of having Braavos as a set. It is unreasonable to conclude that they would go to that effort just for the Stannis meeting with the Iron Bank.


Braavos is not "a set".Â  The fact that they built an Iron Bank meeting room (and possibly some adjoining ones) doesn't in any way mean that also have a House of Black and White and the various places Arya goes as well, seeing as there's no crossover between them.

We have seen the Titan on the trailers however, which points to a more fleshed out Braavos

couldn't agree more, the theme of "the cost of war" will likely continue through Brienne & Pod next season.
721	WTFSalami	2014-04-09	Perhaps they will try to go to the Vale, but quickly find that the mountain clans, much better armed, have began encroaching into the Vale while laying waste to surrounding towns and mills.
I could see the final scene between Arya and Sandor being one where they are grossly outnumbered, and Sandor tells her to run before making his "final stand" against a large group of clansmen, and she bolts away on horseback.

723	Ironborn Iditarod	2014-04-09	Noone else thinking its the Mountain Clans will get him and injure him?


Â 
This is the most likely scenario to me at the moment.Â  We know they are headed that way, we know the Mountain Clans prey on small groups travelling in the area and know they are more heavily armed these days.Â  Build up the Unsullied hopes that sisters meet again and then crush it...ahh, wonderful.Â

While this could happen it would be too much like how Syrio saved her for my liking, but you may be right. Â Of course it could be another scenario with the Mountain Clans where they fight them off and both escape, but the Hound is wounded and it ends like in the book.Â

That was kind of my thinking, that it would be a callback to Syrio. 
Or maybe, to show how much Arya has changed as a character, instead of running, she unflinchingly joins in and helps fight off the attackers, with Sandor getting wounded at this point, and the rest of their arc playing out much the same way it did in the book. 
Although it would come off weird if they played it the same way, because Arya and Sandor have a much more grudging respect companionship than they did in the books.
727	Lord Spark of House Spark	2014-04-09	Â 
First time post from a long-time lurker, de-cloaking to say that this is precisely what I'm really worried about. Â As a firm believer in the Gravedigger theory, if Arya does divert from the story in the show, and does give him the Gift instead of riding off... it seems to me that would carry some heavy implications for any future (theorized) involvement Sandor might have in the books.
It's my hope she finds she can't do it... but because she's come to care for him.
If she gives him an on-screen death, I will cry ALL of the crocodile tears. Â I'll probably keep reading and watching, but I'll hate myself for it, LOL ;o)


Â 
Arya doesn't consider killing as "a gift" yet, that is part of the HOB&W theology


Their last scene looks like they were heading to razed and burnt villages which means the sacking of Saltpans. I think they might toss upon some Bloody Mummers and the Hound gets his wounds against them.


This sounds more likely to me

I thought so too, and then she gave the gift to the squire that she gutted in the fight at the Inn at the Crossroads.
731	FC_Lymond	2014-04-09	Brienne is also in KL at the same time as Sansa in the show.Â  That plot has changed too.

I think show viewers will get more suspense that a meeting with Sansa and Arya or one of them with Brienne will occur than book readers did.

Pretty sure the gift of mercy is going to be in the show, it was in one of the promos. "That's where the heart is, girl. That's how you kill a man." Helluva lot of subtext right there. And later he asks, "You remember where the heart is?" Those lines are too good to lose.While this could happen it would be too much like how Syrio saved her for my liking, but you may be right.

I agree that Arya will not leave Westeros until Episode 10.

Â It should provide some great entertainment by taking advantage of the chemistry between Rory and Maisie. Â Â

I am fine enough they will want to play out this season.  That is getting into too fanfic.
I actually want to see Sandor with the quite island.  I take it is a huge spoiler but it will be how I want for them to keep the Hound.  We are going be losing too many great characters this season.

All good things come to an end. Many people would no doubt have liked to have seen Sean Bean's portrayal of Ned to continue for many seasons as well. He had to get the chop to drive the plot forward... as does Arya finally having to strike out alone.

Â Â Â  Yes, I would think so, unless they really want to stretch the plot out, due to fear that the show will catch up to the novels. But Tywin died in the third book, and this entire season only has to cover about the last 400 pages of that book, so I'm guessing he's history around episode 8 or 9.
757	TheNorth's1stKnight	2014-04-11	hopefully they don't write off the hound and find a way to keep him around somehow like they're doing with bronn
758	RoamingRonin	2014-04-11	Their story is going to be stretched out a bit. I imagine scenes the books glossed over will be made into episode long events. For example: Arya and the Hound crossing the river or the time they stayed in that village where Arya killed "Ser Soldier".Â

I'll be cash-money we'll get a scene this season of Arya warging Nymeria. It's been entirely too long since we've seen or heard of Nymeria. Now is the perfect time to bring her back since Jon is fighting wargs and Bran learning to be one. TV viewers need to know all of the Stark children are wargs.

Maisie was asked about warging in one of her innumerable promotional interviews and she talked about it as something she'd like to see in future seasons; it didn't sound like it was going to be brought up this year.
760	Konradsmith	2014-04-12	To those who were questioning whether or not Arya would go to Braavos...its confirmed. They've cast Gary Oliver as "Braavosi Captain" and he appears in episode ten. So that's that.
Â 
As to how the Hound will be wounded, I will reiterate my previous post here. Watch "the weapons and training" feature. They filmed his wounded scenes in Iceland and there looked to be Knights of the Vale present. So either he helps them out or they wound him. It would bring a nice consistency to the series if he's helping them fight Tyrion's former buddy tribesman who now have Lannister weaponry. It would be kindof like America arming Afghan militias during the Cold War. What do they call it...blowback.

Â 
I disagree. I think last season they established Bran as a warg and what they are, I think this season establishes that Bran is more than that, then the show can establish that the rest of them are. Either this season or next. It seems important to not over lap those things.
Â 
I mean besides the cat for eyes and Jon needing to enter Ghost we know nothing of how important it will be for them to be wargs. Could they drop it? IDK, I mean I hope not but never count out cutting out the magic element when possible.Â
762	Zorn Gottes	2014-04-12	I rewatched the episode and I noticed the Hound was actually wounded on his back (he also stretches his hand to reach the bleeding cut), but I really much doubt he will die from this injury: the trailers show they have at least five more scenes together: 1) Arya saying her prayer 2) the gift of mercy 3) Arya training with her sword 4) Arya & Hound walk together, him counting his money 5) a fight scene
Agreed with those who say he will be wounded again in the fight scene in the Vale... If so he will be wounded just few meters before they reach Sansa

First time post from a long-time lurker, de-cloaking to say that this is precisely what I'm really worried about. Â As a firm believer in the Gravedigger theory, if Arya does divert from the story in the show, and does give him the Gift instead of riding off... it seems to me that would carry some heavy implications for any future (theorized) involvement Sandor might have in the books.
It's my hope she finds she can't do it... but because she's come to care for him.
If she gives him an on-screen death, I will cry ALL of the crocodile tears. Â I'll probably keep reading and watching, but I'll hate myself for it, LOL ;o)


Â 
If she kills him on-screen, that probably means that Sandor isn't coming back in the books either. There is no way the TV producers and writers wouldn't use Sandor if GRRM tells them that he plans to use him in a latter book.

767	Lord Spark of House Spark	2014-04-12	just remembered what happens at the end of Kick Ass, the Hound wouldn't want to go out that way. that'd drive him to the quite isle just thinking about it
768	Daedric Justice	2014-04-12	I didn't think that Arya's smile at the end of the episode seemed especially cold or dark. At the beginning of the episode all she had was her grief, her pain, her anger and her hunger. At the end of the episode she had vengeance, Needle, a horse and some chicken. I think it's understandable that she was feeling chuffed at that point.
Â 
Also, in the book Arya has been through and done more than she has on the show. I'm pretty sure she must have killed one or more soldiers during the battle with Amory Lorch's men, although there were no confirmed kills, and she seemed pretty much at ease with killing the guard at Harrenhal. Plus she was quick to skewer that kid when she fled KL so, all in all, she is comfortable with killing already. She just needs to become more proficient. Â 
Â 
If Sandor does indeed get injured in the Vale then it will be a crime against TV if we don't see a face-off between the Hound and Shagga/Timett and co. Arya will need to double back to Saltpans so it seems like a strange detour to make though.

Yeah, I've always preferred Arya and the Hound being teamed up, they have suprisingly good chemistry together in the books as well as the TV series, there sort of like Dunk&Egg with a much darker feel to them.Â
770	Marillon	2014-04-12	Does anyone get the feeling that in the TV show, they seem to be putting a softer, gentler spin on this? Almost like they're a team? In the books, despite the fact that they worked together, you could see there was an underlying hate there and that Arya would get rid of The Hound as soon as she could, meanwhile in the tv show, it seems that they're building this "reluctant team" angle- a vibe I didn't get from the books at all. Is it just me?

Â  I think when I read the book I got the feeling for awhile that they were actually starting to grow on each other. Especially after Sandor saved her in the aftermath of the Red Wedding. Of course it all fell apart when Arya left him to die, but up until that point, I thought they might become friends lol.

________________
Â 
Yeah, I agree. That's why I felt surprised when Arya decided to let Sandor suffer by denying him the gift of mercy. When I read that part of the book I felt straight away that it would not go down that way on the tv show, regardless of how their relationship develops on screen. In the book even Arya subsequently thought she might have been a bit harsh and I'm not sure how the tv audience would feel about her character if she acted unnecessarily cruel.

Â 
Anyhoo, I also feel that the relationship between Arya and the Hound in the show is very different from that in the books. Â And it worries me that we'll see that deviation carry forward.

Sandor is a Faceless Man! Sandor is Syrio! Sandor is a skinchanger! Sandor is Balerion the Black Dread (hint he loves chicken, see Tywin/Robert failed assassination attempt by choking)! Sandor is the old blind hound! Sandor is Dog! Sandor is the pack of dogs outside the Hollow Hill of High Heart! Sandor is the Direwolf mother! Sandor is the boar that killed Robert!

Â 
Ser Lepus, I thought a fellow scholar of the dead language might appreciate this. Kinda has to do with training,facelessmen,names,skinchanging,connections to ADWD prologue.
Â 

Â 
Â 
" Â One day she came across a rabbit, purely by happenstance. It was brown and fat, with long ears and a twitchy nose. Rabbits ran faster than cats, but they couldn't climb trees half so well... There's a hunter now. Lumpyface Lumpyhead Rabbitkiller." COK Arya
Â 
Â 
So this is a connection between FM training/ chasing cats / and our furry little friends, the Lepus. I think being a Faceless Man requires a skinchanger/warg ability at its core. Notice that she is given the name Lumpyface by Lommy then Lumpyhead by Hotpie. It is Rogre or is it Biter? anyway he call's/gives her this specific name. He also includes the title " the hunter ".
Â 
Whom is the only " hunter " mentioned in regards to skinchanging/warging? Haggon the Hunter mentor to Varamyr ( anagram for Arya ) also know as Lump.
Â 
Did I just blow your mind linguistically and with my literary connections? I hope the show follows your path and keeps Sandor and Arya together long enough for some pre-lessons before shipping her off to Braavos after a failed attempt at getting to Lady Lysa. Maybe Littlefinger being at Eeyrie with Sansa could help get her to Braavos since that is where he is from on the same ship that brought the dwarf troop?

778	Talking Hodor	2014-04-15	In ASOS, the hound is gravely wounded in the tavern fight, which leads to Arya leaving him and going to Bravos. What do you think will happen now that we can see his injuries aren't as bad as they are in the book?


I think they'll run into Rorge and Biter instead of Brienne.Â  I don't see Brienne's trek through Westeros being dragged out as much.
Â 
I could also see him simply joining up with Septon Meribald in the monastery on his own.
Â 
Or they could reveal in an upcoming episode that he actually did get more seriously wounded that we were led to believe in this episode.
779	Ser Not Appearing	2014-04-16	I haven't read through all the posts here, but he definitely got slashed right before going down. They didn't call attention to it but that could easily be the injury that does him in... and they're just going to surprise people.

Also, when will Fake Arya pop up?
783	A Bong of Ice and Fire	2014-05-21	Yeah I think another fight will happen mid season with some other King's men, possibly with Rorge and Biter to refresh the viewers on who they are before the Brienne incident. The Hound gets wounded (possibly bitten) in THAT tussle, and Arya's journey progresses solo from there. I think that would be a good call if they are doing that as although The Hound/Arya relationship is great, there's not much going on Â between the tavern fight and Arya going to Braavos.

Holy $#!+ this was prophetic!

I must have been looking into the flames that day. And just like Mel, didn't read them with 100% accuracy. Didn't predict Rorge would be dumb enough to walk straight into a pointy sword or Biter would be manhandled so easily. So I guess Brienne bites someone else's ear off.

786	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	I'd stop short of 'brilliant' at the moment.Â

I agree about how some diversions have been stitched back together very well, but diversions that I have concerns with are (and not limited to) Shea's character change (GRRM himself has voiced concerns about how they are going to get where they need to go from where they have taken her role) and Melisandre's magical appearance at the BWB after the Mountain couldn't find them for years (although I have no problem with Gendry replacing Edric) and 'Yara' sailing up the Narrow Sea.

Some jarring outstanding concerns for me are as mentioned Jaime and Brienne in Kings Landing but also another one the episode pointed out which is full of good points and bad is the tavern scene at the end. It to me stands out as a good example of the adaptation at its finest. Especially when you consider that whole scene encompassed 3 separate points form the books. The concern is in the fact the hound is meant to walk away from that fight with a mortal wound am I not correct.

Â 
No, I think they have done a terrible job everytime they deviate from the books even a little bit. Â The show is great because it's based on great material and because HBO has spent a huge amount of money to bring it to life. Â And also because the show's writers have tried to be faithful. Â I understand that they cannot always be faithful to the books due to various issues that are out of their control, so maybe the fault isn't completely theirs. Â But pretty much every storyline that has only appeared on the show, not the books, is boring (see Pod's scene at the brothel, Theon being tortured, Ros and many others).
790	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-08	I didn't find Theon's torture boring, but each to their own I guess.
791	eyeheartsansa	2014-04-08	I think brilliant is fair enough. Â I really think they have done a bangup job of the whole thing, and the only changes that really weirded me out were some of the stuff in Qarth like the weird coup and the big vault. Â It is really hard to write stuff like this and there are probably budget, logistical, actor scheduling, etc. considerations that we as book fans have no clue about.
Â 

Â 
Â 
Edit: oh and Jaime/Brienne getting to KL so soon... it just creates so many issues that didn't need to be made.
Â 
For me the question isn't 'will Jaime be in the right place at the right time so that his character experiences all the same thoughts and emotions as Book Jaime,' but instead a much more basic 'will it make for good TV?' Â I say yes, absolutely. Â Lots of the changes have to do with using the actors to their fullest potential. Â Jaime gets to KL early because that means we get more scenes with Jaime (don't forget Brienne!) than we might have otherwise. Â it is a change that will heighten the drama and the intensity - I really don't think it's going to wreck anything. Â 
Â 
I am no purist; I'd rather watch a good show than a flawless adaptation. Â The books are always there if we want to revel in our favorite details. Â Game of Thrones is an HBO show that I enjoy on the same level as, say, Mad Men or LOST. Â It is mostly built around dialogue and character scenes, and some of the best moments are the result of imagining 'what would happen if x and y had a conversation.' Â For example, Melisandre and Thoros comparing notes about R'llor, or Arya chit-chattign with grampa Tywin. And I thought Pod's brothel scene was hilarious for what it was, if somewhat of a dead end plotwise (I had all these theories about LF and the money, when really it was just the writers having fun with Pod).
Â 
And then when they throw a bone to book readers, it's that much more enjoyable. Â The credits rolling at the end of 'Blackwater,' for example, made my jaw drop.
Â 
So yeah, I agree that the writing is pretty brilliant, and seeing as the show is getting massive critical acclaim and commercial success, so you are not alone.

I don't think that every little detail has to be exactly the same as in the books. There are some diversions I don't like and also budget and time constraints, I think if they had the chance to make each seasons 12-13 episodes long it could have been brilliant.

795	Loerwyn	2014-04-08	It's been a year or two since I read the books (and I've only read them once), so I'm not exactly grounded in the series' plot. I remember bits and pieces here and there, but a lot of the quibbles I don't share because, well, I don't really remember them.
Â 
I think the adaptation is both good and bad. I mean I'm loving seeing Brienne in the flesh, and though she's a bit awkward (well, she was in S2, not so much now we're in S4), she's amazing. And characters like Davos are excellent despite some of the changes. I am yearning for some of the book's later plotlines to come into effect and really shake up the story, though.
Â 
But in truth, I think this adaptation is as good as it's going to get considering:
1. The books have not yet been finished. GRRM has an end-goal, this has been communicated to the people behind the show, but to us it is unknown and for all we know the road to said conclusion will be different.
2. The size and scale of Westeros, the castles, the armies, etc. cannot be communicated on any realistic budget. For them to do a 100% accurate adaptation would require an insane budget, and the show would arguably be unwatchable, not to mention it'd have extremely long seasons and a lot of favourite characters would not be in it as much. Can you imagine them going a whole season without Dany?
3. GRRM can do what he wants in the books. The show people cannot do what they want in the show. Pretty much all of the sexual assaults have to happen off-screen (especially for those who are under 18 - Sansa and Dany being the two exceptions that come to mind) and the show has to be engaging. This means some characters get more screen time than they had in the books, it means some get less. We'll have a constant stream of Dany and Jon because those two are some of the characters that are biggest with the fans. Tywin won't go for a little while yet, IMHO, to capitalise on Dance but also because he's a popular character with a lot of potentially awesome scenes.
Â 
I think it's a good adaptation that suffers from some miscast roles, some problematic imagery (Dany's final S3 scene comes to mind) and a lot of the book's content being consolidated. But despite all of that, it's good.
796	Mr Smith	2014-04-08	I agree. Overall, they've done a very good job. I certainly don't agree with everything they do, but I don't think the show could have fallen into much better hands (I think it helped a lot that they were fans of the books). You should drop in on the D and D appreciation thread and repost your thoughts
797	protar	2014-04-08	It's certainly not the worst adaptation out there, and it's clear D+D are aiming to stick to all the main events. However there are a lot of unnecessary changes, a lot of things "cut for time" when they could have taken the place of random brothel scenes and there's a lot that's been simplified when it didn't really need to be.Â
798	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-04-08	I think it's a great adaptation and I think book fans whinge on like entitled children for the most part.
799	Queen of Whores	2014-04-08	I think it's a great adaptation and I think book fans whinge on like entitled children for the most part.

Yeah, so? We love the books, and want to see all (or most) of the stuff that we love from them translated onto the screen. When that doesn't happen in some cases, of course people are gonna get annoyed and disappointed. What's wrong with having expectations?
800	SkaggCannibal	2014-04-08	I think it's a great adaptation and I think book fans whinge on like entitled children for the most part.


You can look at it in two ways, D&D are bringing our favorite fantasy to the screen, which we should already be thankful for in itself. Or D&D are making fat money on the back of our favorite fantasy, all the while slaughtering it where they feel it's needed.
Â 
I do not believe I should be thankful for in itself, D&D are getting enough for it in return already. I actually like the tv show, but when I feel they are crossing a line (again), I believe I am entitled to express that opinion. And not just being a whining entitled kid. It just means I care about the source material.
801	Cas Stark	2014-04-08	I'd go with very good, with a handful of inexplicable bad choices. D&D "get" the gist of what they're doing but they flake out on occasion. Â 
Â 
I don't mind the plot trimming, I don't mind no weasle soup or if there is no Val, I don't even really mind the Thenns being cannibals. Â What I do mind is when they make changes that create a butterfly effect of bad plot logic, like Independent 21st Century Volantis Nurse, or like Mel grabbing Gendry, giving a speech about not frightening the lamb and then terrifying him, leeching him and then immediately deciding to kill him, etc. Â 
Â 
I also mind the somewhat inexplicable repetition of some storylines, like Shae and Tyrion a million times, Varys and LF a million times, all having the same conversation...when other plot lines and characters are desperate for more time.
802	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-08	I didn't find Theon's torture boring, but each to their own I guess.


Â 
I thought some of the torture went on too long, and I'm certain it confused the hell out some Unsullied.Â  It was just a bit too much.Â  I understand the reasons it was done so early, the all around Reeking of Theon, but after awhile it seemed more gratuitous than any of the sex and nudity.
Â 
For me, I'm one who didn't mind the changes with Pod and the sex scene.Â  I love the hell out of both book and tv Pod, and since Tv Pos is a bit older, I think it was a nice touch.Â  That guy playing him is precious.Â  When it comes to his travels with Brienne, they are gonna need a talker to hang with them, ya know?Â  lolÂ

At least the torture served a purpose. Pod getting his jollies did not.
804	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-08	I think it's a good adaptation. I love the books, but this is TV and some of the things in the books just won't work for the medium. Also, I like some of the changes and that we as book readers get to be surprised with some of the changes. For me a good adaption will have changes but stay faithful to the core story and show a respect and love for the source material. Â The show most certainly does this and as a book fan, I love that they throw things in that are a nod to book readers. Â Yes, there are things they have changed that I don't like. Probably the two that I'll never let go is how little we saw of Catelyn Stark last season (way too underused) and I really would have preferred that Sansa's wedding had gone down as it had in the books. Â But I'm trying to let that go b/c they still have a chance to fix Sansa, whereas there's nothing they can do to fix what was done to Catelyn.
Â 
The Jaime and Brienne being in KL is odd, but then we got that awesome scene between Joffrey and Jaime so it's pretty much worth it - the whole feeling and awkwardness of that scene. Â I loved it.
Â 
I think the two stories that I'm unsure of how they are going to handle are Bran and Dany - those have been mightily sped up. So we'll see how those stretch out over the next two seasons.

805	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-08	Hmm...where are all the 'Stannis character assassination' replies?Â  
Â 
I agree, the show has done a great job at bringing the story to life.
Â 
My main problems are-
One of my favourite parts about the books are the Direwolves and the bond they share with the Stark kids ( e.g. GreyWind going down like a badass and Jon and Ghost being inseparable). However, they're merely just pets in the show and don't get the attention they deserve.
Too many pointless sex scenes just to stick to the nudity rule (boobs in every episode) which takes away from other scenes they could be doing.
I still insist that the Jeyne Westerling plot was better than Talisa- Robb was too honourable and naive like his father rather than 'she's hot, I'll marry her and myÂ feelings come first.'
The main character of 'Team Dragonstone' is Melisandre and Stannis is just her puppet.
That being said, these things don't ruin the show and the adaptation is great to watch.

806	boojam	2014-04-08	Who thinks adaptation of this series in the strictest sense of the word has been brilliant so far?It too would stop short of brilliant.The amazing thing is (like the dancing bear) that Dave and Dan have taken a behemoth of a story and done something good with it as visual drama.I sometimes despair that the 12 (or more) episode format has bitten the dust, I frankly that with HBO could bring on the resources to do 12... yes, yes, I know D&D say there not enough hours in the year, and I think for them and Bryan that is true, but that tell me they are not willing to delegate work for their baby to added competent hands.Alas, that ship has sailed.Every now and then they seem to bungle a sequence, but more often than not, the next sequence will be brilliantly written with Jim Krack dialog!To wit, one could see how much fun they had writing Arya and the Hound's dust up at the tavern, even tho GRRM gave them the cake to work with.I only think they crashed and burned once, episodes 3-8 for Dany in season 2. I felt episodes 1, 2 and 10 worked that season, but I might blame George ... Qarth worked on the page... notice George R. R. Martin wrote not one single Qarth scene for season 2 ... I know he had Blackwater... still would like to know if he had anything to say about the problems.Elsewise I keep the books and the show separate in my mind as far as criticism goes.Not that that will keep me from commentary about the adaptation.
807	Rhaquentis	2014-04-08	I love the books, I love the show. It's only when I stop to nitpick, that I like the show less so. It's still amazing what they have done so far and how pretty much everything (apart from some details - I agree that time showing more skin could be spent otherwise) is faithful to the story. I hope they continue like this, and tell the story to its end. I'll still be watching, anyway
808	coatzin	2014-04-08	I enjoy the show, but isn't a very good adaptation.

Imagine if they had spentÂ any of that kind of effort of developing what was happening beyond the wall, instead of inconsequential character development on a minor character. It added nothing of value.
812	'96Buck	2014-04-08	I think you can see the reason behind most or all of the changes and understand why it's compelling, over all, in the adaptation.
Â 
For example, I think it's very likely that the Crackclaw point expedition will be dropped.Â  Without it, we need some other way to get Brienne and Podrick as established as necessary.Â  Pod ends up getting known for sexual prowess, which is of course noncanon, but it's SOMETHING so we know who he is when we need to later.Â  It's not hard to imagine that Jaime gives her oathbreaker and gets her ready to "steal" Sansa to bring her to the Eyrie...the best Jaime can do to keep his oath.Â  But then Sansa disappears and Brienne's quest goes on down the needed path.
Â 
Jaime's back in KL "too soon."Â  Yep.Â  But we need to see the character development that readers get in part while he's traipsing about in the Riverlands winding down the last conflicts, and I doubt we will get all of that in the show, with which I agree.Â  So we get some scenes in KL, including with Tywin, where he can have some scenes to express where he is and take some additional "fuel" for changes.Â  And if that puts some of the most popular and powerful actors in "noncanon" scenes, but makes the show more entertaining, then that's a good choice as an adaptor.
Â 
Arya kills the wrong brigand the wrong way or in the wrong place.Â  Sure.Â  But do we see her develop as needed?Â  Does she recover Needle?Â  Are they done in a way that doesn't devote excess scarce time to it while being visually and emotionally effective?Â  All yes, IMO.Â  So that's good adaptation.
Â 
Is there "excess" gratuitous nudity or violence?Â  Is that redundant?Â  All in the eye of the beholder, and I will suggest there are probably some viewers who really care about the nudity.Â  I didn't "enjoy" the Theon torture (I don't think you're meant to) but I didn't think it was "excessive" in the sense that the show has to SHOW (not tell) us how his personality can transform so radically, and IMO nearly incredibly...it generally takes nearly incredible actions to generate nearly incredible results.
813	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-08	Those whores going at it for free is more fantasy than the dragons.


Â 
I'm just saying that out of all the stupid extra sex, this scene actually doesn't bother me.Â  I kinda like it.Â  And, I like the idea of Littlefinger too busy spying on Ros spying on him instead of counting his coins.Â  I'd take Precious Pod's sex scenes over half the other crap they've shoved down our throats.Â

What they needed to fix was the actual crap they wrote for beyond the wall.Â  That would have been a place to start.
815	JesterX	2014-04-08	The writers clearly take shortcuts to get to the same place.Â  They are about where they should be in the books.Â  Except I'm wondering about the Hound not appearing injured at all after the tavern fight in episode 1.Â  It's about time for him and Arya to separate.Â  I'm wondering how that's going to happen.Â  I also hope they don't make them show any kind of (non-sexual, of course) affection for each other.Â  One of my favorite scenes in the book was the way Arya coldly walked away from the hound after he got sick.

Â 
And do those viewers care about the complex characters? The political plotlines? The moral ambiguity? I doubt it and I don't think that D+D should be targeting the show at those people. I think the majority of people would rather the show just got on with the story. If that story logically ends up in a brothel then I'm sure most people can appreciate a side-dish of fanservice, but side-dishes are just that. They need a main meal (aka plot) to go with them.

Crackclaw deletion - I said as much previously and was shouted down. Some see it as critical for some reason. I really felt it was filler as GRRM was trying to undo the Meereenese Knot.
Â 
Knowing Pod - so it could be:
A) Brienne "So Pod, ummmmm, you're that sex god then hey? Wink Wink Nudge Nudge" (Audience - oooo errrr, that's right, he's the sex god!)
 Brienne "So Pod, you killed a Kingsguard?" Pod "Yes, he was going to kill Lord Tyrion" (Audiece - Ohhh that's right, he's the kid who saved Tyrion)
Â 
I'll take a serving of , please, no anchovies.
Â 
Jaime in KL - It could have some problems but I am more than happy to see how it pans out.
Â 
Arya - I am actually very happy with how they have gone about it.
Â 
Theon - I agree with you. It was distasteful, but it was supposed to be. Did it go too far? I think not. He has far more skin and body parts still on his person than in the books. Having Reek magically appear would have been far too much of a WTF for the screen. The actual physical torture didn't really take up much time. The dialogue and mental torture had to be shown to make the breaking of Theon believable.
Â 
Nudity - The problem isn't really the nudity, it was the overuse of the brothel scenes that has caused the reaction. Pod's scene came at a time when many were just 'over it' and at a time when other stories were floundering.
Â 


Â 
What they needed to fix was the actual crap they wrote for beyond the wall.Â  That would have been a place to start.


Â 
Agree 100%
Â 
But they are too busy planning the climax of Pod-the-Sex-God's super powers.

822	boojam	2014-04-08	I don't think since Blackwater, which makes sense in that he's trying to keep a lowish profile.I will have to look again but I don't think he had the 'Hound Helm' at Blackwater.That damn helm looks only ceremonial not practical.Why he, or many others, don't have some kind of actual battle helms is beyond my and George's understanding!
823	Cas Stark	2014-04-08	I don't think it's "nudity" per se, it's overuse of nudity, as in long drawn out brothel scenes that serve no purpose, like the one with Ros and the other whore where LF is schooling them in how to fake the sex...that is a lot of wasted screen time..especially since we see LF and Varys constantly plotting and smack talking about their plotting. Â Or the infamous Pod scene that served no purpose. Â Or the pointless scene with Bronn and the whore before Pod comes to get him, it tells us nothing about anything. Or Â the worthless everyone spying on everyone in LF's brothel, again, really we get it, we already got it, about LF and about KL. Â  Some of this is fine. Â But ALL of it, when there are a lot of storylines that use an extra minute here and there gets annoying.

In absolute terms it doesn't match the books, but it's actually almost empirically impossible to make a screen version of anything else other than a short story that does the book version justice. Â I'd say the only other successes in that regard is the old black and white film version of To Kill a Mockingbird, and the 1990's BBC TV version of Pride and Prejudice. Â  Â There are just too many differences between the two mediums for a one-to-one translation work.

Â 
I was thinking of that Pride and Prejudice adaptation with this thread. I've re-watched it several times and I think it may arguably be one of the most faithful and best adaptions from book to screen. Â 
Â 
I get that HBO will have nudity, which is fine, but agree with the comments that when it serves little purpose and seems wasted on some small plotline - I'd rather see that time devoted to more of the actual story.
826	Ravi Seaworth	2014-04-08	The scene with Overyn was good. Every non-reader I know immediately a picture of what he really is. This is really important for know. Other than that, there really were gratuitous sex scenes that I don't deem necessary. They would do better by concentrating more on clever dialogues as they did in this first episode IMO. As for the quality of the adaptation, I am not a purist. Therefore, I don't care about specific dialogues or secondary characters. What is important is the main story, preserving its main events, main characters, motivations, etc. Here, they made a great job in most cases, I think. Depicting Stannis as being manipulated by Mel is not the best move, but they still have time to correct that. It would be another comeback: Stannis standing for himself and saving the day. What matters is that the non-readers get a good impression of what he is capable of in the good sense.

A) Brienne "So Pod, ummmmm, you're that sex god then hey? Wink Wink Nudge Nudge" (Audience - oooo errrr, that's right, he's the sex god!)
  Brienne "So Pod, you killed a Kingsguard?" Pod "Yes, he was going to kill Lord Tyrion" (Audiece - Ohhh that's right, he's the kid who saved Tyrion)
Â 
I'll take a serving of , please, no anchovies.
Â 
Jaime in KL - It could have some problems but I am more than happy to see how it pans out.
Â 
Arya - I am actually very happy with how they have gone about it.
Â 
Theon - I agree with you. It was distasteful, but it was supposed to be. Did it go too far? I think not. He has far more skin and body parts still on his person than in the books. Having Reek magically appear would have been far too much of a WTF for the screen. The actual physical torture didn't really take up much time. The dialogue and mental torture had to be shown to make the breaking of Theon believable.
Â 
Nudity - The problem isn't really the nudity, it was the overuse of the brothel scenes that has caused the reaction. Pod's scene came at a time when many were just 'over it' and at a time when other stories were floundering.
Â 
Â 
Agree 100%
Â 
But they are too busy planning the climax of Pod-the-Sex-God's super powers.


Â 
As long as Littlefinger isn't directing whores fully dressed, or Theon telling bitches to TURN OVER, I might live through it, LOLÂ  Really, I do hate most of the extra, gratituous sex stuff, but Pod is Precious.Â  
Â 
The Wall and Beyond and Jon Snow specifically has been a mess the past couple seasons.Â  I was pleasantly surprised by all of that on the premiere, I'm a little hopeful that they MIGHT be getting some of that on track.Â  Fingers crossed.Â
833	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-08	Â 
I was thinking of that Pride and Prejudice adaptation with this thread. I've re-watched it several times and I think it may arguably be one of the most faithful and best adaptions from book to screen. Â 
Â 
I get that HBO will have nudity, which is fine, but agree with the comments that when it serves little purpose and seems wasted on some small plotline - I'd rather see that time devoted to more of the actual story.


Â 
I do think the big problem is actually, yes, all the filler, but I think we're just getting tired of Littlefinger's effing brothel, ya know?Â  Jeez, isn't there ANY competition?Â
834	MarieAntoinette	2014-04-08	It is an adaption that has to appeal to a wide audience. They have to cater to the bigger public if they want to finance 7 or more seasons of a very expensive show. There is no way that the could have made a page for page book to screen adaption. Considering that and also the huge cast of characters they did a great job with preserving the main story and getting most of the characters (The Robb-Talisa Arc aside) right. Also given that GRRM does not write the script for every single episode and people tend to view things differently there will always be some elements that are the show writers own viewpoints and opinions on the characters (which do not necessarily have to be the same as yours or mine) included in an adaption.

835	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-08	The scene with Overyn was good. Every non-reader I know immediately a picture of what he really is. This is really important for know. Other than that, there really were gratuitous sex scenes that I don't deem necessary. They would do better by concentrating more on clever dialogues as they did in this first episode IMO. As for the quality of the adaptation, I am not a purist. Therefore, I don't care about specific dialogues or secondary characters. What is important is the main story, preserving its main events, main characters, motivations, etc. Here, they made a great job in most cases, I think. Depicting Stannis as being manipulated by Mel is not the best move, but they still have time to correct that. It would be another comeback: Stannis standing for himself and saving the day. What matters is that the non-readers get a good impression of what he is capable of in the good sense.


Â 
I am hopeful for Stannis this year.Â  They went overboard trying to show the somewhat down turn that Stannis took after the Blackwater.Â  I'm even more hopeful after seeing episode one, since I finally recognized Jon Snow again.Â  There MIGHT still be hope for Stannis.Â
836	Greywolf2375	2014-04-08	It's a fine adaption, it's some of the best TV around and has been in an era when writing/acting/etc is pretty much at the tops.
Â 
Are there gaps & short comings?Â  Absolutely.Â  Are there places where it exceeds the books?Â  Well, not as many as short comings, but there are some.
Â 
Where I have seen the most gaps is when the plotting does go away from the books - not that it isn't a direct word for word adaption, but when new plots are created, some of the new characters or characters removed, etc.

I agree. Â They do well when they are still riffing on the GRRM stuff, whether they condense it or change it around, Â but when they have completely struck out on their own with invented plot lines and characters...not so much.
838	'96Buck	2014-04-08	Â 
And do those viewers care about the complex characters? The political plotlines? The moral ambiguity? I doubt it and I don't think that D+D should be targeting the show at those people. I think the majority of people would rather the show just got on with the story. If that story logically ends up in a brothel then I'm sure most people can appreciate a side-dish of fanservice, but side-dishes are just that. They need a main meal (aka plot) to go with them.
Â 
I feel like I use food metaphors too much when talking about narrative, but the point stands.


I suspect some people like some aspects more than others, and wouldn't watch if their favorite"dish" were not offered.Â  Since D+D can't let viewers order from the menu, they have to put out a spread where every customer can get helpings of what they like.Â  Some people fill up on chips and salsa.

840	Travy1991	2014-04-08	I think it's a really great adaptation. I get extremely excited for it every week. I understand that writing a television show is different to writing a novel so most changes don't get to me. I think it maintains the spirit of the novels and that's the most important thing. I embrace many of the changes too because there's great potential in them. I have no problem with Jaime arriving in King's Landing earlier because he gets to interact with Joffrey and assimilate back into King's Landing before all the shit goes down. My main gripes with the show so far have been:
Â 
1) Changing Asha's name to Yara. It feels like an insult to our intelligence. We can tell the difference between Asha and Osha. Just like we could tell the difference between Jon Arryn and Jon Snow.
Â 
2) The Robb and Talisa storyline in Season 2. It worked well in the end with that extra layer of tragedy in Talisa and her unborn child being killed but their arc in Season 2 was silly romcom fare. The plucky nurse with her very modern notions of warfare admonishes the king and he falls for her completely. GRRM has said himself that the peasant girl would have her tongue cut out for talking like that to the king and he's right. Granted, Talisa is eventually revealed to be of noble birth but Robb didn't know that. Then I hated the way Robb (who really can't pass for 18 or whatever age he's supposed to be) decides to throw a big immature "fuck you" at his mother and marry Talisa out of spite (and love too I know). Basically Robb came across stupid yet sympathetic in the books when he married Jeyne but he just comes across borderline delusional on the show.
Â 
3) The whitewashing of Tyrion and Catelyn.Â They've removed nearly all their flaws. Tyrion is the white knight of the show (whereas he was greyer even in the earlier novels) while the show found a way for Catelyn to feel remorse for how she treated Jon Snow. I liked that scene where she made the confession about Jon Snow simply because of Michelle Fairley's acting but it took aways some layers from her character. While I can forgive that scene to an extent, I dislike the way Catelyn's character became all about her maternal instincts and less on the savvy, political and often rational (when not ruled by emotion) side.
Â 
4) The recasting of Daario Naharis and Gregor Clegane.Â Obviously the show can do nothing about this but it's a shame there has been so many recasts. I watched Season 4 with a few friends and they were confused about the new guy playing Daario and they were like "Where did Khaleesi pick up this guy? (It also drives me nuts how the TV fanbase think her name is Khaleesi)"
Â 
5) The symbolism.Â I think the show has been hurt in refusing to be trippy and trying to ground Bran's green dreams and Dany's House of the Undying scenes. They could have done a Joss Whedon "Restless" on some of those scenes and really foreshadow what's to come.
Â 
6) Bran's storylines and Theon's Season 3 storyline.Â The pacing when it comes to these storylines is poor but that's also a fault in how much coverage GRRM gave them in his novels.
Â 
7) Shae.Â I'm not averse to changing Shae up and I've liked her scenes with Sansa but her petty attitude with Tyrion is annoying and was particularly grating in 4x01.
Â 
That said, I am able to overlook most of these things and think the show has fantastic casting, production values and gets the big moments across perfectly. The writing could be improved slightly though.
841	protar	2014-04-08	I suspect some people like some aspects more than others, and wouldn't watch if their favorite"dish" were not offered.Â  Since D+D can't let viewers order from the menu, they have to put out a spread where every customer can get helpings of what they like.Â  Some people fill up on chips and salsa.


Â 
If you seek to appeal to two demographics, chances are you're just going to end up annoying both. At the moment GoT seems to be trying to cater to two separate audiences on completely different ends of the intellectual spectrum - those who are interested in the characters and scheming, and those interested in boobs. Not to say those interested in boobs are necessarily unintelligent, but they're not really pursuing that intelligence when they're watching GoT just for the nudity. They're juggling two demographics which couldn't be more different if they tried and I really doubt that it's helping the show. People interested in the complex narrative are going to be frustrated whenever a random brothel scene pops up. People only interested in boobs are going to give up sitting through all the complicated stuff and instead just venture forth into the internet to get what they want.Â 
Â 
I have no problem with sex scenes where it progresses the plot, or even incidental fanservice/nudity that doesn't take up screen time all by itself. But the random brothel scenes have got to stop.
842	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-08	Obviously it's not perfect and has some flaws, but like the OP I'd defend the show against most critics because on the whole it is a fantastic adaption that's largely stayed true to the characters and storylines despite starting to drift away from them a little bit.
843	Cas Stark	2014-04-08	I doubt very much people are watching GOT for the nudity. Â That's what all the Starz shows are for, LOL. Â There isn't enough soft porn in the show to attract that type of a viewer.
844	SeventySeven	2014-04-08	When it comes to nudity I don't even think it's GoT, it's HBO as all of their shows have these campy nudity/sex scenes.
845	boojam	2014-04-08	The only problem I have with it is that it's set in Medievil England and not Westeros in my eyes.To me George's books seem set in Medieval England and Medieval North Africa and Medieval Italy.... with Dragons , the Wall( even tho that's based on Hadrian's Wall) and some goofy stuff about magic and Mordor like dark forces.Tho kind of lite on thee heavy fantasy stuff.
846	boojam	2014-04-08	Watch Dune, both the movie and the TV series.Watch WatchmenThese are terrible adaptations.Well Lynch's DUNE is not too bad, it could have been worse, Ridley Scott got fired from doing the film because of the god awful screenplay he turned in (amazing for Hollywood!).The TV series for DUNE was a total Cluck a Duck disaster.John Huston was a genius at adaptation, The Maltese Falcon , The Treasure of the Sierra Madre , ... The Man Who Would Be King ... so it can be done.
847	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-08	Â (It also drives me nuts how the TV fanbase think her name is Khaleesi)"
Â 
Â 


Â 
This should be added to your list as a bolded point. It is wholey the fault of the show and Â Jorah the Explorer's not enough 'Your Grace' and too much 'Khaleesi'.
848	Alayne's Shadow.	2014-04-08	In general, It's a good adaptation. There are some glaring mistakes (Robb-Talisa arc), but it could be worse. I just miss Jeyne Westerling, and how that storyline would have been ages more interesting than Robb's moments chatting with Talisa.
849	Peter George Stewart	2014-04-08	There are times when I've been worried, but I think they've struck a great balance between running with things that work on screen and sticking true to the books.Â  The plot is there, most of the important characters are there, and true to the books, but they've elaborated on things that were only small in the books, and created some things specially for the show, but none of it has deviated too much from the essence of GRRM's work.
850	Clariana	2014-04-08	Â 
Â 
Imagine if they had spentÂ any of that kind of effort of developing what was happening beyond the wall, instead of inconsequential character development on a minor character. It added nothing of value.


Â 
Why are you so certain Pod is a minor character? How can we be sure?
851	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-08	Because I read the books.
Â 
Sure, he may have a bigger role in the future, but given that GRRM did not give him magical uber lothario powers I feel justified in questioning that the Show's depiction had any relevancy. I am certain that wherever his story goes, he is still of less important than the events at the Wall - specifically Jon's character development and the depiction of the Wildlings while he was with them.
852	Khal Porno	2014-04-08	It's funny reading people talk like experts about things they completely don't understand.Â  Do any of you know anything about television production other than what you've read in Entertainment Weekly or seen in a behind-the-scenes fluff piece?Â  Have any of you ever tried to adapt a piece of work from one medium into a completely different one?Â  Do you know anything about screenwriting, or construction of character arcs for episodic television? My guess is no.Â 
Â 
Also it's mind boggling to me that no one seems to realize that we are watching a pair of fans' interpretation of the series they have enjoyed, and of COURSE the things these two people find important or how they view a character will not always jive with how you do.Â 
Â 
Just look at how fractured these forums are with people arguing over who Dany, Catelyn, Stannis really are, or arguing over which scenes are pointless and are absolutely essential, because all these people have different interpretations of the same text.Â  But no, David Benioff and Dan Weiss MUST agree with YOUR view of A Song of Ice and Fire, because if they don't then they just don't understand the whole thing.
Â 
Ugh.Â  Game of Thrones is remarkable, not only as an achievement in its own right, but also as an adaptation.Â  I've NEVER seen an adaptation as faithful as this show is.Â  Everyone splitting hairs over ultimately minor changes must never have seen any of the Stephen King adaptations or watch the COMPLETELY different Walking Dead (which is lead by the creator and writer of the comic book, no less).
853	Queen of Whores	2014-04-08	It's funny reading people talk like experts about things they completely don't understand.Â  Do any of you know anything about television production other than what you've read in Entertainment Weekly or seen in a behind-the-scenes fluff piece?Â  Have any of you ever tried to adapt a piece of work from one medium into a completely different one?Â  Do you know anything about screenwriting, or construction of character arcs for episodic television?

Awww, did we hit a nerve somewhere?
I apologise on behalf of everyone here who is obviously so ignorant and unworthy to discuss anything negative about an adaptation, or anything we aren't experts in really. I guess we can't say food doesn't taste nice, because we aren't all chefs. Please, step off your high horse and have a civil discussion with the rest of us.
854	dtones520	2014-04-08	Every adaptation is going to take its liberties with the story it is telling. Characters are going to be left out, scenes are going to be added/cut, characters looks will be different, etc. But, in my opinion, as long as the major plot points are told and the series is well written and has good acting, I could really care less what they do. The majority of added scenes and changed storylines have been good tv, some of them have even been more interesting than the book (Arya being Tywins cup bearer was more interesting than her time with Roose).
What you can always expect though is avid book readers to nitpick every single thing in an adaptation because it is not how they pictured it when they read it. Guess what, this is David and Dans adaptation of the books, which they love. So they have to take their opinions of characters and events and make interesting TV out of it. They have to take an incredibly complex story with hundreds upon thousands of characters and families with loads of history and make that simple enough for the average tv viewer to understand while also being mind fucked by an incredible story.
Like I said, they have hit every major plot point thus far and the major plot points are what kept us reading, not the minor stuff leading up to them.
855	Queen of Whores	2014-04-09	^ Yeah, cause fuck proper character development, right? Stannis and Catelyn have been possibly the most screwed over characters so far in the show, with Stannis being turned almost into a villain in season 3, and Cat being simplified into a concerned mother who is as important as a background prop. It's fine to get the main events done properly, which the show has mainly done acceptably, but when the characterisation of important characters isn't being done right at all (look at Tyrion in the show...) then their adaptation isn't as good as it could be.
856	dtones520	2014-04-09	Awww, did we hit a nerve somewhere?

I think it's more of an issue with some avid book readers being so incredibly nitpicky about how a story is adapted to screen that it is super annoying for everyone else who enjoys the series. For example, the way the Thenns are being portrayed now is a hot button issue. Are the Thenns really that important to the ASOIAF main storyline? No. Do we really have a wealth of information about them from the books? Not really. But because the show runners decided to make them Cannibals it's like the sky is falling and we get a 9 page post about it on here. Does it really matter that the Thenns are portrayed differently in the book? Is it really going to impact Jon's story at all? No, so who cares?
857	Queen of Whores	2014-04-09	^ I agree I couldn't care less about the Thenns, since they are very minor in the big picture, and Jon needs foes that are actually intimidating, so I'm fine with that change. It was a cool scene as well, so that's okay. I'm talking more about how a lot of the characterisation of characters has been screwed over badly, not so much about stuff like the Thenns, which yeah, people are overreacting a bit.
858	dtones520	2014-04-09	^ Yeah, cause fuck proper character development, right? Stannis and Catelyn have been possibly the most screwed over characters so far in the show, with Stannis being turned almost into a villain in season 3, and Cat being simplified into a concerned mother who is as important as a background prop. It's fine to get the main events done properly, which the show has mainly done acceptably, but when the characterisation of important characters isn't being done right at all (look at Tyrion in the show...) then their adaptation isn't as good as it could be.

Once again, it is David and Dans adaptation and the way characters are portrayed is how they have pictured those characters. If you listen to interviews with them about Stannis, they genuinely think Stannis is a bad guy and not a good king for Westeros, so that opinion is going to come off in how they portray him. How they portrayed Cat is how they viewed Cat.
There are people on these forums who love Cersei and defend her every action, I'm guessing they would portray her in a different light than I would as someone who thinks she's an insane bitch.
859	Queen of Whores	2014-04-09	^ It's true that everyone will have a different view on a character, but when show runners actively let it influence how that character is portrayed and shown to everyone, just to suit their personal tastes, then I can very well understand how people can get upset. They should try to be as objective and unbiased as they can, so as to let the show watchers make up their own mind.
860	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-09	It's funny reading people talk like experts about things they completely don't understand.Â  Do any of you know anything about television production other than what you've read in Entertainment Weekly or seen in a behind-the-scenes fluff piece?Â  Have any of you ever tried to adapt a piece of work from one medium into a completely different one?Â  Do you know anything about screenwriting, or construction of character arcs for episodic television?

Â 
I do! I'm just an intern at this point, but I did major in film and television production. And obviously...this means absolutely NOTHING because all those years at college, all the script adaptations and film projects mean jackshit when you get into the real business. My opinion really isn't more or less valuable than anyone else's. But that's another topic
Â 
I've read (somewhere, now I don't remember) that there are four main types of changes that ocurr from one medium to another:
Â 
1) Changes because of production reality: Shit happens, life ain't perfect. Call it a tight filming schedule, insufficient budget, poor planning, logistics failure, problems with the actors/directors/producers/screenwriters, terrible weather on location, impromptu guild strike, etc.Â 
Â 
2) Changes because of different interpretations: What you said, Khal Porno. You're absolutely right, adaptation really is, almost by definition, an interpretation. Why? Because a literary text is not something static you can just copy. It's a dynamic thing that comes alive in different ways for different people, and those different visions all come together to create the final product. Take Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy. That's his take on Peter Parker, not mine and maybe not yours. But since he's the guy adapting the thing, his vision's the one we get to see. Unfair? Arguably, but he's the one in charge.
Â 
3) Changes because of (deliberate) interpretations: This could seem a bit confusing, but according to many critics, interpretations are not optional or voluntary. We don't really choose how we interpret something, we just see it from our own perspective and personal biases. However, there are changes that happen deliberately, with the screenwriter or director not only fully aware of the change he or she is making, but also there's a reason to it. Maybe something from the source material bugged me, maybe I'm trying to eliminate controversial undertones, maybe I think I can make something work better than it does on the source material, maybe I'm trying to change something to appeal to an specific demographic, maybe I want to say something personal using the story, maybe I just don't like something, etc. Obviously, examples of this are infinite, but maybe Stanley Kubrik's adaptions of The Shining, Space Odissey, A Clockwork Orange, etc, show how Kubrik tweaked and molded the original material to fit in tons of references, symbolisms, and themes that he wanted to explore.Â 
Â 
4) Plain mistakes: Even if a script goes through dozens of rewritings, corrections and supervisions, people ain't perfect. Someone thought a character's eyes were green instead of blue, for example. One recent case of this was (reportedly) in 12 Years a Slave, when a female slave asks the lead character to kill her to end her suffering. Apparently in the original memoir it's in fact the slave owner's wife who asks this out of jealousy. Apparently the thing in the book was phrased in such a way that invites confusion.
Â 
I would add another type of change or maybe a sub-type: when an interpretation is clearly and objectivelly wrong. Before you scream bloody murder, I must add that although we all have our own interpretations of literary texts and they're certainly valid, they must have at least have to be somehow supported by the text. That's why I don't think, for example, that Joffrey is a lovely angel out of heaven, because the text clearly don't support that. The reason why I call this a sub-type is because this can often be the result of lack of attention or interest, which results in a somewhat unsupported interpretation. One memorable example of this: Dumbledore running towards Harry like a bat from hell bellowing "DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIRE??" and then shaking the shit out of the poor kid.Â 
Â 
But here's the catch: what if this change was intentional? What if Mike Newell really thought Dumbledore acting like the troll from the first book would bring something good to the scene? What if, for some bizarre reason, Newell saw Dumbledore reacting like this when (and if) he read that part of the book? Is it still fair game, if he's the director with the vision, even if most people agree that Dumbledore ain't like that?
Â 
So all this to say that this topic is a frustrating clusterfuck and people in the damn industry still don't agree on it and they get into constant arguments over it (yeah, this is not something we only do in discussion boards).
Â 
My personal stand on adaptation in general? My one rule is "If it ain't broke don't fix it, unless I have a good reason to do it", which, yeah, is frustratingly vague and not confrontational. But what you gonna do, everything's subjective.
Â 
I think the show is a good adamptation, not brilliant, not bad, good. My main gripe would be that Martin's forte is dialogue and I wish D&D would take advantage of it more, since the dialogue in the books is very, very tv/script-friendly. That's all. But I do think (and here's speculation) that the show could surpass the books in terms of editing, tightening some loose ends in Feast and Dance.

I agree with you, but I'm willing to bet if you asked David and Dan they would say they feel like they have done that or at least have tried to do that based on their interpretation of a character. Keep in mind this as well, they also then hand the character off to the actor portraying that character and that actor can interpret and portray a character completely different too and once you get shooting, you are on a limited schedule where you can't go back and recast someone way late in the game.

I've been going round and round in circles with people for a year and a half listening to people complain about how David and Dan are "butchers" and listening to people whine endlessly about "character assassination" and "whitewashing" and how David and Dan "don't understand" A Song of Ice and Fire, because they refuse to acknowledge that different people have different interpretations, and they don't have any clue how the adaptation process works, or screenwriting and television production or character arcs for episodic television, so they throw out ridiculous assertions of how things "should have" been done or cast aspersions onto David and Dan's intentions and competency.

It's gotten quite tiresome and I have no patience for it anymore, so I'm going to call it out.Â  I would love to have actual debates over these things, but instead of people saying "I didn't agree with that" or "I would have done this differently" or "that's not my cup of tea," "I didn't like this," and at least acknowledging the skill and craft that's gone into the show, people are always saying "this sucks," "D&D are butchers who don't know what they're doing," "this is ruined," etc. and the assumption that their opinions are the undisputed correct ones.
Â 


^ Yeah, cause fuck proper character development, right? Stannis and Catelyn have been possibly the most screwed over characters so far in the show, with Stannis being turned almost into a villain in season 3, and Cat being simplified into a concerned mother who is as important as a background prop. It's fine to get the main events done properly, which the show has mainly done acceptably, but when the characterisation of important characters isn't being done right at all (look at Tyrion in the show...) then their adaptation isn't as good as it could be.


Ha, this is exactly what I'm talking about.Â  I love Tyrion on the show.Â  I think that he is mostly the same character as he is in the books, with a few differences allowing for the needs of the show as well as the actor playing him (the audio commentaries by David & Dan and George R.R. Martin for season three talk about how they tailored Tyrion slightly for how Peter Dinklage plays him).Â  I read the same book you did.Â  I guess I'm just wrong, huh?
Â 
Â 


^ It's true that everyone will have a different view on a character, but when show runners actively let it influence how that character is portrayed and shown to everyone, just to suit their personal tastes, then I can very well understand how people can get upset. They should try to be as objective and unbiased as they can, so as to let the show watchers make up their own mind.


Or they could make the show the way they want to make it, and let the READERS of the books (of which the show has created many, more so than there ever were before) discover how Tyrion is portrayed according to George R.R. Martin's vision.

Lolwut. There is no logical way to say that the Tyrion of the books and the Tyrion of the show are "mostly the same." I don't know how long it's been since you've read the books, but there are many differences in behavior and personality. At the point we're up to on the show, in the books Tyrion has: broken a man's fingers out of spite, slapped Shae for making him feel petty, threatened to whip, beat and rape Tommen, made Sansa strip naked, groped her and almost forced himself on her, and had a man murdered and made into soup.Â NoneÂ of these things have even remotely happened in the show, and it wasn't because it wasn't feasible or possible to put on screen. Of course it was. The show creators just didn't want to show Tyrion in a negative light at all, since they love him too much to admit or show any faults or morally dubious activity. Tell me one negative thing he's done in the show that can be seen as selfish or mean. I can't remember any. Even when he was "made" to marry Sansa, they madeÂ himÂ out to be the victim, instead of the poor 14 year old girl that was to be his wife, against her will. This is not a "slight tailoring," thisÂ isÂ a whitewashing, in every way.
864	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-09	Watch Dune, both the movie and the TV series.
Watch Watchmen
These are terrible adaptations.
Game of Thrones is actually a pretty great and incredibly accurate depiction of the books.
The only problem I have with it is that it's set in Medievil England and not Westeros in my eyes.


while i agree it's a bad movie. Wasn't watchmen a super faithful adaption?
Â 
Edit- I love both show Â and book tyrion, but they aren't the same. Book Tyrion did some dubious stuff at this point, while the show has made him mostly a pretty good dude. Maybe after he kills Shae and Tywin he will go down the same dark path is on now.

865	Khal Porno	2014-04-09	Â 
I do! I'm just an intern at this point, but I did major in film and television production. And obviously...this means absolutely NOTHING because all those years at college, all the script adaptations and film projects mean jackshit when you get into the real business. My opinion really isn't more or less valuable than anyone else's. But that's another topic
Â 
I've read (somewhere, now I don't remember) that there are four main types of changes that ocurr from one medium to another:
Â 
1) Changes because of production reality: Shit happens, life ain't perfect. Call it a tight filming schedule, insufficient budget, poor planning, logistics failure, problems with the actors/directors/producers/screenwriters, terrible weather on location, impromptu guild strike, etc.Â 
Â 
2) Changes because of different interpretations: What you said, Khal Porno. You're absolutely right, adaptation really is, almost by definition, an adaptation. Why? Because a literary text is not something static you can just copy. It's a dynamic thing that comes alive in different ways for different people, and those different visions all come together to create the final product. Take Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy. That's his take on Peter Parker, not mine and maybe not yours. But since he's the guy adapting the thing, his vision's the one we get to see. Unfair? Arguably, but he's the one in charge.
Â 
3) Changes because of (deliberate) interpretations: This could seem a bit confusing, but according to many critics, interpretations are not optional or voluntary. We don't really choose how we interpret something, we just see it from our own perspective and personal biases. However, there are changes that happen deliberately, with the screenwriter or director not only fully aware of the change he or she is making, but also there's a reason to it. Maybe something from the source material bugged me, maybe I'm trying to eliminate controversial undertones, maybe I think I can make something work better than it does on the source material, maybe I'm trying to change something to appeal to an specific demographic, maybe I want to say something personal using the story, maybe I just don't like something, etc. Obviously, examples of this are infinite, but maybe Stanley Kubrik's adaptions of The Shining, Space Odissey, A Clockwork Orange, etc, show how Kubrik tweaked and molded the original material to fit in tons of references, symbolisms, and themes that he wanted to explore.Â 
Â 
4) Plain mistakes: Even if a script goes through dozens of rewritings, corrections and supervisions, people ain't perfect. Someone thought a character's eyes were green instead of blue, for example. One recent case of this was (reportedly) in 12 Years a Slave, when a female slave asks the lead character to kill her to end her suffering. Apparently in the original memoir it's in fact the slave owner's wife who asks this out of jealousy. Apparently the thing in the book was phrased in such a way that invites confusion.
Â 
I would add another type of change or maybe a sub-type: when an interpretation is clearly and objectivelly wrong. Before you scream bloody murder, I must add that although we all have our own interpretations of literary texts and they're certainly valid, they must have at least have to be somehow supported by the text. That's why I don't think, for example, that Joffrey is a lovely angel out of heaven, because the text clearly don't support that. The reason why I call this a sub-type is because this can often be the result of lack of attention or interest, which results in a somewhat unsupported interpretation. One memorable example of this: Dumbledore running towards Harry like a bat from hell bellowing "DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIRE??" and then shaking the shit out of the poor kid.Â 
Â 
But here's the catch: what if this change was intentional? What if Mike Newell really thought Dumbledore acting like the troll from the first book would bring something good to the scene? What if, for some bizarre reason, Newell saw Dumbledore reacting like this when (and if) he read that part of the book? Is it still fair game, if he's the director with the vision, even if most people agree that Dumbledore ain't like that?
Â 
So all this to say that this topic is a frustrating clusterfuck and people in the damn industry still don't agree on it and they get into constant arguments over it (yeah, this is not something we only do in discussion boards).
Â 
My personal stand on adaptation in general? My one rule is "If it ain't broke don't fix it, unless I have a good reason to do it", which, yeah, is frustratingly vague and not confrontational. But what you gonna do, everything's subjective.
Â 
I think the show is a good adamptation, not brilliant, not bad, good. My main gripe would be that Martin's forte is dialogue and I wish D&D would take advantage of it more, since the dialogue in the books is very, very tv/script-friendly. That's all. But I do think (and here's speculation) that the show could surpass the books in terms of editing, tightening some loose ends in Feast and Dance.


Thank you, this is an excellent post.Â  I will say that your experience studying/working in the film industry does matter because it informs your perspective, so you know not to say "they changed this for no reason, how dare they??"
Â 
You're absolutely right that adaptation is subjective and will be informed by the adaptor's interpretation of the text and personal taste.Â  It would be nice if people around here realized this, as well as the fact that the adaptation in their heads is subjective as well (which is why there are 20 threads saying "DANY IS USELESS" and another 20 threads of "DANY IS A GREAT LEADER") and could debate these things on a subjective level rather than "I'm right, this is wrong and it sucks!!!!!"

I've read all the books at least three times, and I read the last two four times if you count the combined ebook "A Ball of Beasts" (a much better read of those two books, I highly recommend it), so I'm familiar with the character and I don't need to get into a "look at all this stuff about him that I know, complete with page numbers and quotes of dialogue to prove my knowledge and superiority to you!" contest.Â  But I will point out that there is much more to Tyrion than these bad things he's done (and which I would posit are more important to him as a character on the whole), and those things are in the show.Â 
Â 
Also, Tyrion on the show is morally questionable enough to be sufficiently "grey" and not at all "whitewashed."Â  I think that it's quite bizarre that this particular issue ruins Peter Dinklage's portrayal for people and it's very unfortunate that they can't see past it to enjoy it for what it is, instead of getting stuck on "it's not exactly like it was in the books, so I can't stand it."
Â 
And real quick, just as an aside that you probably won't care about, George R.R. Martin has said REPEATEDLY that he loves Peter Dinklage as Tyrion on the show.Â  I think it's safe to say he is more familiar with the character than any of us here, so if he likes him then I guess you are wrong that Tyrion's been ruined.

Â 
I'm trying to look past how condescending you are, so... where did I have quotes of dialogue and page numbers? I merely briefly listed some morally questionable things he did, since theyÂ doÂ define who he is as a character. Yes he's done other things that make up his character as he is, and the show definitely hasn't skimped on the nice things he's done,Â butÂ those darker things he's done contribute a lot to who he is, and help put context behind some of his later, even darker actions. I don't see anything that show Tyrion has done that's morally ambiguous or 'grey.' I asked for some examples, yet you still haven't given any.Â 
Â 
As to your last point; why are you so rude in assuming I wouldn't care what the author has to say?Â ObviouslyÂ George will say he likes the portrayal, since he won't exactly come out and say "no, it's terrible and not like the books. Everyone, boycott this show!" He tries to be as supportive and accepting of the show as possible, since they are paying him to write an episode for it, and he likes to give input wherever he can.Â
870	Khal Porno	2014-04-09	what has tyrion done so far in the show that is morally questionable,employing Bronn?


Seriously? I've had this debate so many times I'm really sick of it.Â  Tyrion has been portrayed as a selfish hedonist who for a good bit of the show only had his own self-interest at heart. He's been dishonest and underhanded when he felt it was necessary, sincerely threatened people with harm or death multiple times, caused people's deaths to save himself and been sexually attracted to, and tempted to have sex with, a fourteen year old girl.Â  That's all morally questionable, in my opinion.

871	Alasdair	2014-04-09	I had a few major issues. Why are the Thenns eating people? Why did valyrian melt so easily? Could they no afford a horse and more thought out retinue for Tyrion? Why didn't they make Brienne and Jamie come at the right time? Why does Daario sound so fucking british (at least he has facial hair, if not blue)? Why does the wacky costume lady know so little about medieval armour or choose to ignore her knowledge? Why did they ever change Sytr, we could have easily had him last series, they wasted about 5 minutes on a crap scene introducing him. Why Shae, I mean even D&D must be sick with themselves for what they did to that character? Lastly why the fuck are we still seeing filler scenes? There is enough content from POVs and implied occurrences that they do not need to fully fabricate scenes!
Â 
All in all my rating as an adaptation is 4/10, as a Game of Thrones ep 5/10 and as an episode of tv still around an 8/10 (I mean even with its flaws this show is so far ahead of the majority!).
872	Alasdair	2014-04-09	Also so bored of them whitewashing Tyrion. It is not Peter's fault. He basically carries the poor writing! Maybe they should just have George write all Tyrion scenes so they stop pissing people off! Also I am so fucking ready for Shae to die!!

I don't think I was being condescending.Â  I merely said I wasn't going to resort to that in order to sound superior to you.Â  Kudos on your recall ability, though.
Â 
I didn't say you wouldn't care what Martin had to say; I said you would ignore the point I was making - which you did by dismissing his words on Tyrion as basically "he's paid to say good things about it" because they run contrary to your argument that Tyrion on the show has been ruined.Â  That does a serious disservice to the man, by the way.Â  He hasn't been afraid to say he disagrees with certain changes to the show, and of course he is diplomatic, but to completely write off what he has to say about Tyrion as not being genuine because of money is really disrespectful.Â  I'm sure he would prefer his exact vision of the character to be completely intact (missing nose and all), but he probably enjoys the characterization and performance for what it is as its own work, and he is probably mostly satisfied with the adaptation of Tyrion.

You should probably stop watching the show if you hate it so much.Â  I stopped watching The Walking Dead because I didn't care for it at all in the third season and realized I was only watching it because I love the comic series. Moving on instead of wringing my hands over it was a great decision.

I don't really find it too hard myself. I knew going in things would get changed, so as long as their aren't any major deviations i'm good. Â  But maybe my idea of a major deviation is different than others
877	eyeheartsansa	2014-04-09	It is an adaption that has to appeal to a wide audience. They have to cater to the bigger public if they want to finance 7 or more seasons of a very expensive show. There is no way that the could have made a page for page book to screen adaption. Considering that and also the huge cast of characters they did a great job with preserving the main story and getting most of the characters (The Robb-Talisa Arc aside) right. Also given that GRRM does not write the script for every single episode and people tend to view things differently there will always be some elements that are the show writers own viewpoints and opinions on the characters (which do not necessarily have to be the same as yours or mine) included in an adaption.


Â 
This, exactly. Â The writers can take a few liberties here and there if it improves the storyÂ as an HBO series. Â Book readers are just one subset of the show's audience/demographic; almost everyone I've talked to who hasn't read the books really enjoys the show and understands the major plot points. Â Because the show is so darn entertaining and well written, I have come to trust the writers and (most of) their reasons for certain choices they've made. Â Most of the changes make perfect sense to me from a TV writing perspective, and some of the changes are improvements. Â Even GRRM has admitted that some things on the show are an improvement; for example Osha's role.Â  Mel's conversation with Thoros of Myr is a great example of how moving characters around can be a way to write some really good scenes and address unanswered questions.
Â 
Premium cable drama is a very different medium from a long form novel, and for a number of reasons it is more desirable to make the best possible premium cable show than to be 100% faithful to the books. Â
878	SheRa Seastar	2014-04-09	Â 
Â 
Imagine if they had spentÂ any of that kind of effort of developing what was happening beyond the wall, instead of inconsequential character development on a minor character. It added nothing of value.

I only read the books this year after watching the show last year. I wasn't even going to read the books until the series had finished so they wouldn't ruin the programme for me.
The Pod scene was one of my favourites, it was funny and added another facet to Pod's character. It's an entertainment show, they need to have little bits of light relief to contrast all the bloodshed. The same goes for all of the sex scenes. Also, it's HBO, there's probably a tits and arse quota that needs to be fulfilled per season.
879	protar	2014-04-09	It's funny reading people talk like experts about things they completely don't understand.Â  Do any of you know anything about television production other than what you've read in Entertainment Weekly or seen in a behind-the-scenes fluff piece?Â  Have any of you ever tried to adapt a piece of work from one medium into a completely different one?Â  Do you know anything about screenwriting, or construction of character arcs for episodic television? My guess is no.Â 
Â 
Also it's mind boggling to me that no one seems to realize that we are watching a pair of fans' interpretation of the series they have enjoyed, and of COURSE the things these two people find important or how they view a character will not always jive with how you do.Â 
Â 
Just look at how fractured these forums are with people arguing over who Dany, Catelyn, Stannis really are, or arguing over which scenes are pointless and are absolutely essential, because all these people have different interpretations of the same text.Â  But no, David Benioff and Dan Weiss MUST agree with YOUR view of A Song of Ice and Fire, because if they don't then they just don't understand the whole thing.
Â 
Ugh.Â  Game of Thrones is remarkable, not only as an achievement in its own right, but also as an adaptation.Â  I've NEVER seen an adaptation as faithful as this show is.Â  Everyone splitting hairs over ultimately minor changes must never have seen any of the Stephen King adaptations or watch the COMPLETELY different Walking Dead (which is lead by the creator and writer of the comic book, no less).


Â 
That's just the thing isn't it. I don't see people asking that D+D write a show which follows our personal interpretations. All I see is people asking that D+D write an objective and unbiased adaptation. As in not writing in new events which make characters look better or worse based on whether or not D+D likes them or not.
Â 
As for the whole "you haven't made a TV show so you can't criticise" fallacy, that is quite simply nonsense. All I need to do to be able to criticise a TV show is watch it. It's also quite a hypocritical argument - would you claim that someone has to be an expert on television production to be "qualified" to praise the TV show as well?

Â 
I grant you all that but put this to you - remember in the books when Jon met Mance he was playing and singing 'The Dornishman's Wife'. The Wildlings, sure they are a grim lot but it was made clear that they were heading South and they were happy about it.
Â 
The character of the Wildlings was completely lost. The character of Mance was completely lost. The character Tormund was all but completely lost. And Jon? Ahhh Jon...
Â 
End of S1 (Whats that Jon doing?) - He's walking in the snow looking surly
End of S2 (Whats that Jon doing?) - He's still walking in the snow looking surly.
Most of S3 (Whats Jon doing?) - He got a shag! But he's still walking in the snow looking surly.
Â 
All of Jon's internal dilemma about perhaps what Mance was doing was right was lost. It was always about waiting until he was finally going to turn cloak again. Pod's scene injected humour, for sure, but all the opportunities for humour North of the wall that was just itching to happen was just abandoned.
Â 
I don't count myself as a Jon fan, but the Wall is a pretty significant theatre in the story and it was left wanting.... but Pod got a shag!!!

881	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-09	At this stage, the TV show more or less looks like an INSPIRATIONÂ from the ASoIaF not an Adaptation.Â

Â 
There are all kinds of reasons to invent new scenes; information needs to be conveyed more efficiently and each scene needs to accomplish numerous things at once. Â So inventing scenes that happen 'off page' is one good way to do this. Â For example, Jaime and Cercei have a conversation in Kings Landing where they basically say the same things that Bran overhears them saying in the book. Â An 'evesdropping' scene would have been awful, so for TV staging the conversation elsewhere was the better choice. Â There is nothing 'objective' or 'unbiased' about any of this - except that these writers have the skill and qualifications to be entrusted with lots of money to produce the series for HBO. Â Other choices are more complex and may involve complete fabrication, and there is nothing 'objectively' wrong with that. Â For example Cercei sharing her childbirthing experience with Cat. Â You can like it or not, but the writers have probably thought it through more than any of us know.

Â 


Â 
Absolutely! Â Anyone can criticize anything they want; however the more someone knows about a topic the more interesting and informative their critique will be.
Â 
For example, GRRM knows more about Westeros than anyone; so his opinions carry the most weight.

883	Nobody of the canals	2014-04-09	The only problem I have with it is that it's set in Medievil England and not Westeros in my eyes.


Â 
Not really, I get the feeling that the thought patterns and the language of the characters sometimes lapse into the current times, especially when D&D are writing their own plotlines or changing existing plotlines into something they like.
Talisa is probably an all-time cliche, Robb's lines like "You want me to marry the Frey girl because you arranged it" and conversations about "charitable work" are completely anachronisticÂ
884	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-09	The medieval England comparison doesn't make much sense considering so many of the accents/architecture/fashion/etc. is inspired by many different cultures.
885	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-04-09	At this stage, the TV show more or less looks like an INSPIRATIONÂ from the ASoIaF not an Adaptation.Â 

This is completely untrue. A gross exaggeration at best.
886	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-09	This is completely untrue. A gross exaggeration at best.


Heh. It is not even an exaggeration, let alone be a "a gross exaggeration". This is solely from my viewpoint. If you think that this an proper adaptation then well be my guest.Â
887	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-04-09	Â

I mean that in the books it's quite fantastical. Moat Cailin is magical esque. Grey Water Watch etc. 
In the show... The places don't seem like 8000 year old fantastical locations. They seem like normal English castles to me.

Well, that's cool and stuff mate, and I do think it's a great adaptation and I think it's very close to the source material. 
Saying it's merely inspired by the books is a gross exaggeration that to my eyes does a huge disservice to the show as frankly I cannot think of an adaptation that follows the source material so closely. 
LOTR doesn't come close to being as close to the source. 
Dune... The less said the better. 
I would say it's as close to the source as anything is likely to get. 
IMO of course, which me not being a writer or working in TV boils down to little more than "this is close enough to me"
889	JagLover	2014-04-09	For the most part the show is as faithful as an adaption can reasonable be.
Â 
TheÂ  majority of the major characters are identical or very similar to the book counter-parts by this stage of the story.
Â 
It is mostly true however that they do better when they stay close to the books. However most of the "invented" material in S3 was far better than in S2 so they seem to be getting better in that regard.
Â 
Rather than "where are mae dragons" or the Rob Talisa romance.Â We had Maergery's Â invented material, Gendry filling in for the other bastard, or Littlefingers "chaos is a ladder" monologue.
890	'96Buck	2014-04-09	I mean that in the books it's quite fantastical. Moat Cailin is magical esque. Grey Water Watch etc.

How much are you willing to pay to watch this show?Â  They can't afford to build numerous fantastic castles.
891	boojam	2014-04-09	In way after four years odd how this topic still comes up, maybe not.One thing I give Dave and Dan credit for, and they even apparently mentioned it to HBO 6 or 7 years ago... that Fantasy, and Adult Fantasy should not have the stigma they used to have.Maybe it was Peter Jackson who pioneered this?The Harry Potter series was really sold as a 'children's' story , but did have a huge fan base.I am amazed Jackson was able to wedge out 300 million on LTOR which is not a children's story, it is adult but not ADULT!I still see critics who are 'genre' unfriendly to GOT, New York Tims you listening?So Dave and Dan must have done some really hard work to sell this story, even if they bungled the first pilot!Hats off to them.
892	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-04-09	How much are you willing to pay to watch this show?Â  They can't afford to build numerous fantastic castles.

I don't expect them too and I have no real problems with the sets which are largely outstanding. 
But for example, Storms End... It's not "magical" enough. 
The book has this mystical quality to it that the show doesn't. 
The magic dreams etc. The warging.
893	lord athos	2014-04-09	the show is one of the most faithful adaptation i ever seen of a book or a series of books. It is not a chapter per chapter adaptation, but the substance is there. The thing is that GRRM world is so rich that it is very hard to translate everything on screen. Television is a very different medium than books. So i think the show must be seen as a take, a perspective on the incredibly complex world of ASOIAF. In this regard, it is very good and successful.
894	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-04-09	They could make it more magicy is my only real complaint basically. 
Yeah I understand the changes they make and sometimes I think "what was the point of that? Just stick to the book" but for whatever reasons they don't. 
The westerlings would have been great. But they aren't in the show and are pretty minor in the books anyway. 
I can't think of many adaptions that follow the source material do closely
895	lord athos	2014-04-09	The change from jeyne to talisa is for me a good one because it gives more impact to the red wedding. In the books, there are a lot of secondary character that die or are captured in this event, but since the show can't portray them, having another important character dying at the wedding is a good way to preserve the emotional substance of it.
896	lord athos	2014-04-09	The oly real complaint i have is the missed introduction of stannis in second season. The guy deserved a good 20-30 minutes of screen time of exposition, since he is the big player entering in the season two. audiences needed to understand where he came from and his motives, which i don't think his introduction allowed. There could have been for example a scene where maester cressen is talking to his soon to be successor maester pylon about stannis background, his childhood and relationship with robert, ect. The burning of the gods should have been more extensive too.
897	Seer of Green	2014-04-09	I've always felt that in the case of adapting a book series (ASoIaF) to a multi-season TV show (GoT), deviations are born out of necessity, for many reasons. One issue is having aging actors portraying children that remain young in the books. Another example is having to deal with a filming budget. There are many vital scenes in the books that would just be way to expensive to film. GRRM has even gone on record saying that some of the changes D&D made were actually better than what GRRM had written. For instance, Martin has said that he liked the way the character of Bronn was portrayed on the show better than the way he wrote. Then you have instances where deviations were made just because certain scenes were simply drawn out loo long and could possibly lose the viewer's attention. But there are certain deviations that I just don't like and/or agree with. For instance, I don't like how much the sequence of Dany in the House of the Undying deviates from the source material. There's just so much that happens at the House of the Undying that becomes the foundation for R+L=J that was completely absent from the way the scene played out on the show. If the R+L=J theory is indeed true, I wonder how D&D are going to plant that seed in the viewers mind when it's so vital in the book. Anyway, that's just my 2 cents. I think most of the deviations work because they were pretty much a necessity, but I do agree that some were unnecessary and in some cases, as mentioned, completely change the future of the series.
898	briantw	2014-04-09	Â 
That's just the thing isn't it. I don't see people asking that D+D write a show which follows our personal interpretations. All I see is people asking that D+D write an objective and unbiased adaptation. As in not writing in new events which make characters look better or worse based on whether or not D+D likes them or not.


Â 
There is no such thing as an unbiased adaptation, with the obvious exception being if it is adapted by the person who wrote the original material (and even then, things tend to change). Â Any time any work is adapted, the person(s) responsible are inevitably going to add their own touch, their own voice, to the material. Â 
Â 
I also really don't understand this logic that D&D are making characters look better or worse based on their personal feelings about a character. Â Do we have any actual proof of this? Â The Stannis rage seems to come from some innocuous comment one of the guys made during an interview that had nothing to do with liking or disliking Stannis. Â As I recall, they said that he would make a terrible king. Â I totally agree with that statement, and somehow I still love Stannis as a character. Â It just seems to me that people took an out of context quote and made it into something that wasn't actually said to the point where the rage is actually kind of laughable.
Â 
For the record, I do think that Stannis' portrayal on the show hasn't been great, but I think that's more due to the writers simply making some mistakes with his arc than some ridiculous desire on their part to make him look bad because they hate him. Â I thought the Talisa arc was poorly done as well, but I don't think it was because D&D hate Robb or Jeyne Westerling. Â I think that they tried to simplify a character's origins and in the process accidentally screwed up a plot arc.
Â 
Yes, we all would like a perfect adaptation, but that's just not realistic for a story this vast and complex. Â Mistakes have certainly been made, and even D&D have admitted that they'd like a few takesies-backsies. Â I don't think, however, that the mistakes are large enough to take away from what is really a pretty great show.
899	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-09	The change from jeyne to talisa is for me a good one because it gives more impact to the red wedding. In the books, there are a lot of secondary character that die or are captured in this event, but since the show can't portray them, having another important character dying at the wedding is a good way to preserve the emotional substance of it.


Â 
Yeah, the changes weren't great overall in that they made Robb look quite stupid, but at least his new wife at least had some sort of character about her, even if she wasn't great. His book wife was essentially a non-character, just there as a plot point.
900	Travy1991	2014-04-09	Heh. It is not even an exaggeration, let alone be a "a gross exaggeration". This is solely from my viewpoint. If you think that this an proper adaptation then well be my guest.Â 


Â 
This is a gross exaggeration. The show is largely faithful to the books and follows the plotlines very closely. I don't know how many books you've read that have been translated to screen but most films and TV shows make drastic changes to the source material for the screen. You only need to look at HBO's other book adaptation, True Blood. I watched the show and then read the books and the show takes massive liberties with plotlines and characters. Some storylines are ghosts of the plot in the novels and the rest was all made up or changed around by the show.
Â 
Game of ThronesÂ might simplify a few characters, switch around the timeline slightly or combine a couple of supporting characters in the novels into one character for the show and that can be an annoyance. But overall, they have stuck pretty firmly to George's novels. Can you honestly say you've been surprised by much in the show? No because you've read the books and the show has followed them pretty strongly.
Â 
As for criticism of the show, I think criticism is valid. I don't doubt at all that Dan and David work extremely hard on the show but I think their ability can be criticised. I'm overall a big fan of the show and think they've done a great job but sometimes their writing is lacking and this is depicted in not giving Tyrion and Catelyn the layers they have in the novels. I don't think the characters are ruined though. Show Tyrion is still the witty, intelligent and scorned dwarf with the fucked up family like he is in the novels and Show Catelyn was still the maternal, grim negotiator that often had her emotional side take over her rationale. Yes, we lost the hints of morally dubious behaviour from Tyrion and the peacekeeping, strategist side of Catelyn but these were never huge parts of their characters arc (sure Tyrion's moral dubiousness is but they can get to that later in the season).
Â 
I'm not against people criticising the show and saying they wish Dan and David could handle these elements better. I'm not against people who say that they can't get past their love of the books to view the show in its own right. I'm not against nitpicking elements they simply have a visceral dislike of. But I do have a problem with people throwing around words like "abomination" and "ruination" as if they are valid statements. Take your nose out of the novels for two seconds and get a grip on reality here!

901	David Selig	2014-04-09	For example Cercei sharing her childbirthing experience with Cat. Â You can like it or not, but the writers have probably thought it through more than any of us know.
Well, given that according to them it was possible for the queen to give birth to a boy without Catelyn finding about it for years, obviously they didn't think this scene through at all, because that's plainly ridiculous.
902	protar	2014-04-09	Â 
Absolutely! Â Anyone can criticize anything they want; however the more someone knows about a topic the more interesting and informative their critique will be.
Â 
For example, GRRM knows more about Westeros than anyone; so his opinions carry the most weight. Â Doesn't mean you have to like or agree with what he says, but yes, he isÂ absolutelyÂ more qualified than anyone here to.

Â 
I of course agree that knowing more about television production will lend people's praise or criticism more credence. But that's not what some people are saying. Many are dismissing any and all complaints about the show if the complainer doesn't have a job in television. And they never use their supposedly superior knowledge to enlighten us as to why a certain change was objectively necessary - they just say "no you're wrong, I'm right." None of these self-termed "experts" here on the forums have ever told me anything I didn't already know from my own education. There's several posters that really need to get off their high horse about whatever jobs they do or don't have in television.
903	Lontra	2014-04-09	Â If the R+L=J theory is indeed true, I wonder how D&D are going to plant that seed in the viewers mind when it's so vital in the book.


Don't you think that they have started with Oberyn's mention of Rhaegar"s running off with another woman?
Â 
In general I think the adaptation is good.Â  Sometimes I find things annoying.Â  I thought Talisa would make my head explode, both with her anacronism and the way her presence warped Rob. Over all though, when I watch an episode the ending music starts and I realize an hour has passed and it felt like 15 min.Â  There aren't many shows that have that effect.Â  So I would say the adaptation has at least captured the absorbing nature of the books.
904	lord athos	2014-04-09	Â

Not at all, sir.Â  I brought it up because of many of your statements about the show as an adaptation that plainly are not realistic because you have absolutely no perspective on the needs of a TV show in relation to the abilities of a novel.Â  The idea that you say an adaptation should be 100% "objective" and "unbiased" is proof of this.
906	Queen of Whores	2014-04-09	Not at all, sir.Â  I brought it up because of many of your statements about the show as an adaptation that plainly are not realistic because you have absolutely no perspective on the needs of a TV show in relation to the abilities of a novel.Â  The idea that you say an adaptation should be 100% "objective" and "unbiased" is proof of this.

Would you be so kind as to enlighten us lesser folk with some examples? I'm seeing much claim from you, but no proof or example. For example, tell us what things that we want are unrealistic, and why. You seem to claim to have a huge amount of knowledge about how TV shows are made, so maybe you can explain why we are so wrong and you are so right, using legitimate examples instead of just claims that we are wrong 
Also, it was me and not Protar who said it should be objective and unbiased. And most of my issues with this adaptation aren't ones that are because of time or cost, legitimate things that can set a show back, but just some poor characterisation of some characters, something that's not hard to get right.

Â 
Protar said that too. Â I quoted him and replied to it a page or two ago.
Â 
And if those things were easy, over ninety percent of the scripted shows on television wouldn't be awful. Â 
Â 
Granted, not every show has a nice blueprint like Game of Thrones does, but at the same time, you can't expect the show to follow every book character in the exact same manner as the book does. Â It's not realistic. Â 
Â 
For example, Stannis has been marginalized somewhat on the show. Â Unlike most, I don't think this is due to some vast conspiracy that has to do with the creators hating the character and wanting to ruin him as a result. Â Rather, I think it has to do with them knowing that Stannis isn't as important long-term as Melisandre, and as such they are making her the focal point of his story. Â Maybe I'm wrong, but I'd take my theory over them arbitrarily hating Stannis and purposefully making him a worse character as a result. Â That scenario suits no one.
Â 
Another example, though less cited, is Talisa. Â Does anyone think she was created because the showrunners hated Jeyne Westerling or Robb? Â Of course not. Â She was created to simplify Jeyne Westerling and avoid bringing in a bunch of (mostly) unnecessary relatives, and to avoid having to explain who she is and why her family is (marginally) important. Â The implementation obviously wasn't perfect, nor was the way Robb first slept with her (like a horny teenager rather than in a moment of weakness after learning his brother dies), but those mistakes weren't born out of any sort of intentional malice. Â They were just decisions made that turned out to not work as well as the showrunners probably thought they would. Â It happens.
Â 
The fact is, squeezing all these characters into ten hours a year isn't easy, and some things will be changed. Â Not everyone will agree with all the changes (I sure don't), but many of them are born out of necessity and some are just born out of mistakes made during scripting. Â It's inevitable in an adaptation as complex as this one, especially one where we (the viewers) know far less about where the story will ultimately end up than the writers.

Â 
So by the logic of not dedicating much time to Stannis' characterization being that he isn't important, this means that the show shouldn't have spent much time on Eddard or Robb, right? Cause obviously they aren't important in the long run
909	eyeheartsansa	2014-04-09	I'm not sure how it's possible to be 'objective' or 'unbiased' when discussing an HBO adaptation of a series of fantasy novels.  This is not a scientific discussion where things can be 'proven' with 'evidence.'  We are all just saying what we think here.

Um, no I didn't.Â  I made no claims, I just asked (the rhetorical question) if any of you have actual experience with it and actually know how it's done and the things that go into it.Â  However I am a filmmaker and a screenwriter, so I know quite a bit about writing for film, and I can tell you it's extremely different from writing a novel.Â  You can't just copy and paste what's in a novel into a screenplay, and if you tried that you'd end up with an utter disaster.

These things are 100% subjective, and are YOUR opinions.Â  Obviously David and Dan, who read the same books - and in fact have had lengthy conversations with the author about them - have different opinions. I know I and many others do as well.

Â 
It's kind of worth noting that television writers are on a deadline and don't have the luxury of taking 18 years to tell 5 seasons worth of stories. Among the many other reasons that books almost always tell better stories than film and television is this, along with the fact that a writer can utilize trial and error. Write the thing, read it, and if it doesn't work, change it before sending it to the publisher. The TV writers could know they need to trim down the Jeyne Westerling character but not be sure of how to do it, try something, and then they're basically stuck with it. They're not going to create a whole new character, recast, and go through the entire filming and post-production process over again. It's not nearly the same thing as deleting and replacing text in a word processor file.Â

I agree, it is insulting!  I have had much more enjoyable conversations with people who haven't read the books and are just able to enjoy the show for what it is.  There is lots going on, but it is not really THAT confusing, anymore than, say, LOST or something.
915	WeddinGuest	2014-04-09	The problem I've noticed is the tendency for polarization among the "book purist" and "show apologist" factions, to the point that we spend more time arguing about the merits/demerits of the other faction than the actual aspects of the adaptation that are in debate as good or bad. I personally don't agree with either the extreme book purist "D+D are hacks who butchered the books and can't do anything right" faction OR the extreme show apologist "the show is great, and if you have ANY problems with it at all, you're just being a nitpicky book purist, why are you even watching" faction.I think overall this is a good, bordering on great, adaptation of the books in terms of the overall plot points. However, much of subtle nature of the books, the grayness of the characters, etc., seems to have been lost. (Though I do find Show!Cersei to be more sympathetic and believable than her book counterpart.) I think that the more introverted characters, such as Jon and Sansa, have suffered from the lack of internal monologue. The greatest divergence, really, is that the show does NOT follow a POV format, but rather the "objective narrator" that tries to give equal time to all sides. This wasn't as much of an issue in S1 when the action isn't spread out as much, but some episodes in S3 seemed really fragmented to me.As for nudity, the issue I have with the "eye candy" nude scenes are how they take away from time that could be spent on other aspects of the show. I didn't mind the brothel scene with Oberyn and Ellaria in S4 E1 because it did actually did serve as a good introduction and Oberyn's behavior seemed quite plausible for his book character as well. (On the other hand, Littlefinger's S1 monologue set to a background of moaning whores was just ridiculous and not anything Book!LF would ever do.)It also seems to me that the showrunners really have chosen to focus more on the "Game of Thrones" politics than the mystical/magical aspects. They also seem to like going for the sudden "shock and awe" approach without much foreshadowing, such as their approach to the RW, which just came totally out of the blue, while in the books there is a slow ramping up of tension and suspense before the killing starts.But I do think it's a strawman to assert that the ONLY reason anyone would object to how the show presents something is out of nitpicky book purism. I can think of many popular shows NOT based on any books that were subjected to criticism, such as the Sopranos, or Lost (especially the finale), and even "How I Met Your Mother" really turned a lot of people off with the finale.

916	Queen of Whores	2014-04-09	I think overall this is a good, bordering on great, adaptation of the books in terms of the overall plot points. However, much of subtle nature of the books, the grayness of the characters, etc., seems to have been lost.Â 


Â 
This is exactly how I feel. I'll admit that I can't really think of any other series that's been as faithfully adapted to screen as aSoIaF, as far as the plot goes, but it's where the characters come in that I get a bit critical. They've done some absolutely perfectly, like Jaime, Theon, Viserys, Tywin and Davos, which are pretty much identical to their book counterparts in all important ways, but then others that really haven't been done with much complexity or depth, like Tyrion, Catelyn and Stannis (though 3x5 was a nice adaptation of him, and I'm thankful of Bryan Cogman for that).
917	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-09	Â 
Out of curiosity, what's a non-reader doing on a thread comparing the books and show?Â 


Â 
Because he can. Kind of a stupid question. Anyway he wasn't commenting on the comparison he's explaining his perspective as a non-reader.

How's it a stupid question? Is it not a reasonable assumption that the only people that would actually comment about the quality of anÂ adaptation of source materialÂ would have, y'know... actuallyÂ read that source material? Obviously I'm not saying he can't post here, but I was curious because it seemed odd someone would even go into a thread about comparisons to the source material without having ever read it

 I did it before I read the books.
You want a perspective on the differences and see how close an adaptation really is.

921	protar	2014-04-10	About the objectivity of the adaptation: Complete subjectivity isn't possible, but there are still plenty of instances where character actions are changed (and not because of time/budget constraints) and those changes paint them in a more positive or negative light. For example the complete lack of almost all of Tyrion's morally ambiguous actions or handing Joffrey some of Cersei's crimes. It would have cost no more time and money to say that Cersei had ordered the murder of Robert's bastards as happened in the books, but instead they clearly wanted to make Cersei more sympathetic. That is a biased adaptation.Â 
Â 
Now thereÂ areÂ changes which are the result of adaptation constraints, but also change how a character is seen. For example it's certainly easily arguable that there was no time for the Symon Silvertongue subplot. Removing it makes Tyrion even less morally grey, but I can't really fault D+D for excluding it. In that respect I don't expect the adaptation to be unbiased. But when it comes to stuff which clearly have nothing to do with time or money, D+D need to put aside their personal interpretation.

922	eyeheartsansa	2014-04-10	The problem I've noticed is the tendency for polarization among the "book purist" and "show apologist" factions, to the point that we spend more time arguing about the merits/demerits of the other faction than the actual aspects of the adaptation that are in debate as good or bad. I personally don't agree with either the extreme book purist "D+D are hacks who butchered the books and can't do anything right" faction OR the extreme show apologist "the show is great, and if you have ANY problems with it at all, you're just being a nitpicky book purist, why are you even watching" faction.


Â 
It may have to do with who reads more books or watches more TV. Â I watch a pretty fair amount of television drama so it is easier for me to think in terms of what works or doesn't work for the medium. Â So I fall pretty neatly under 'show apologist,' because GOT is better than 99% of television dramas I've enjoyed.Â  Compared to other high profile adaptations, ie, Potter, LOTR, etc. I'd say it holds up favorably, but as far as premium cable it is groundbreaking and without much precedent. Â 
Â 
I also discovered the books and the show at the same time, and was reading and watching the first season/book simultaneously because I couldn't get enough of it. Â So unlike other fans, I didn't have years to imagine my own version of the characters. Â I enjoy the books and show equally and on their own respective terms.
Â 
We have to remember a huge number of fans / viewers / HBO subscribers who aren't remotely interested in reading the books and don't give two shits about the differences. Â There is nothing wrong with that, and I feel the same way about other shows. Â And if weren't for those viewers, we wouldn't have made it to season 2, much less season 4.

Well it did not confuse me or anyone I know who watch the show but have not read the books, you don't like it fine but do not try to qualify it by saying "I bet the non book readers were confused, bless them" it is insulting


Â 
Did I sound snarky, at all?Â  The words 'I BET' do not equal......it is true that absolutely NO nonreader could figure it out?Â  For your information, I do know quite a few nonreaders who were beyond confused about it, which was quite understandable, unlike your response to a post that just discusses the differences with the adaption to the screen and how many view it.

It is not necessarily their personal interpretation but what they think will make better TV.
Â 
Yes Tyrion is more clearly a good guy on the show, but he is in the books as well for the most partÂ right up until the end of ASOS where he takes a more morally ambiguous turn. Having him be so makes for better TV as you have a protagonist to root for, but also highlights that though this is a war of Stark against Lannister it is not one exclusively of heroes versus cartoon baddies.
Â 
As for Cersei they have clearly decided to highlight the plight of noble women in loveless marriages in culturesÂ such as these, which is why they have softened her. I very much doubt they personally 'like' book Cersei, it is a deliberate decision to increase complexity (even more important as in S5 it will be mainly Cersei's storyÂ at KLs) .
925	briantw	2014-04-10	;
Â 
So by the logic of not dedicating much time to Stannis' characterization being that he isn't important, this means that the show shouldn't have spent much time on Eddard or Robb, right? Cause obviously they aren't important in the long run 

I would disagree with the idea that Ned and Robb are not important just because they die in the books/show.  Ned's discovery and ultimate death are two of the key factors that began the War of the Five Kings.  Robb and Cat's deaths, on the other hand, are a catalyst for the entire Northern plot going forward, and I'd also argue that Robb's actions (kidnapping Jaime, breaking his vow to the Freys) have had a tremendous impact on the story.
As far as Stannis goes, we really don't know how important he will be in the long run.  It could be that his key purpose in the story was to unite Melisandre with Jon Snow.
I will agree that, if the showrunners have that knowledge, it's a bit cheap of them to utilize it to alter Stannis' character arc, but at the same time it's hard to blame them if it helps them shave some time that can be focused elsewhere and also shift the focus to the (ultimately) more important character (Melisandre).

927	Seer of Green	2014-04-10	Don't you think that they have started with Oberyn's mention of Rhaegar"s running off with another woman?

Yeah, but the way it was delivered, it came across as just an off the cuff remark Oberyn used while explaining all of the slights and atrocities against his family. If it is meant to plant the R+L=J seed, I don't think it was a good way to go about it. To us book readers, it was obvious what/who Prince Oberyn was referring to. But I don't think there's been enough mentioned over the past 3 seasons that would lead those who only watch the show to understanding the meaning of that line as us book readers do. I just think that the seed should be planted for show watchers only with a lot more focus and emphasis than a small remark from Prince Oberyn. Two of the biggest catalysts for the R+L=J theory in the books, Ned's fever dreams in AGoT and Dany's sequence at the House of the Undying in ACoK, are either different or absent altogether in the show.
928	'96Buck	2014-04-10	<snip spot-on stuff requiring no response>Â  There's just so much that happens at the House of the Undying that becomes the foundation for R+L=J that was completely absent from the way the scene played out on the show. If the R+L=J theory is indeed true, I wonder how D&D are going to plant that seed in the viewers mind when it's so vital in the book.

I think we know Stannis's purpose at least entails integration of Wildlings into the events of the North south of the wall, as well.Â  If not breaking Dreadfort's power, at least bleeding them and wedging between Manderly and Bolton/Frey.

Haha good catch, but I think you got what I meant there.  Jaime being taken captive was huge for his character development.
And yes, Stannis does definitely help with the wildling integration, but he's likely still going to do that on the show, so it won't really be impacted by what we've seen so far.  We don't know, however, if Stannis will even survive the attack on Winterfell.  You know who does, though?  D&D.

Â 
Fortunately the two go hand in hand. In my opinion the show is almost always better when they stick to the books. Not just because I'm seeing the events from my favourite series on screen (because D+D have made the odd change I've liked more than the books), but because the parts that stick to the books are outright better than when D+D decide to fly blind so to speak. The writing is better, the plotting is more logical, the dialogue crackles more, it's just all around better.
934	Daske	2014-04-10	If you take out the top five or so big impact scenes that almost everyone likes (Ned's death, Red Wedding, Darcarys etc) it would be interesting to see a top-twenty favourite scenes and top-twenty favourite quotesÂ from non-readers. I suspect there would be a lot more added (or heavily changed) scenes & quotes than many bookreaders think.
Â 
Admittedly, there would be a few popular in the worst scenes list also!
Â 
But I'd easily put two added scenes & two new quotes just in my top five.

I think your standard is completely backwards, the way to judge the show as an adaptation should be how many of the book readers' favorite scenes made it to the show. Â Let's take out the 5 or so book readers favorite scenes(Â Ned's death, Red Wedding, Darcarys etc) as you say, now name me the next 20 favorite book reader scenes, and tell me how many of them made it to the show.
Â 
Â 
I would say they did a good job in Season 1. In season 2, they did a good job with the Tyrion storyline line, but my other favorite scenes, weasel soup, "sharp", HOTU, Â and Reek's betrayal of Theon, all either were completely removed or altered beyond recognition.
936	Seer of Green	2014-04-10	Â 
Step 1...explicitly characterize R as "leaving Elia for another woman" 

As I said, everyone who's read the books need no explanation as to what Prince Oberyn was referring to by "for another woman". I just don't think it's mentioned enough over the past 3 seasons for people that just watch to understand what Oberyn is talking about. That's why I feel like Oberyn should have said "for Lyanna Stark" instead of "for another woman." Just hearing the word "Stark" would be enough for show watchers to understand the importance of what Oberyn is saying and that it might be something to remember for later on.

Very true. Goes back to how some things that works in books just don't translate when adapting to a movie/TV series. And I'm not saying that they were wrong for not including Ned's dream sequences, just that two of the main arguments for R+L=J in the books are absent from the show. I think it would be a mistake to go the flashback route, therefore the writers are going to have to come up with different ways to accomplish what Ned's fever dreams and the original sequence of Dany at the House of the Undying did in the books. I completely agree that there is plenty of opportunity for those that only watch the show to be told about the story of Rhaegar's "kidnapping" of Lyanna in detail, which I believe will come from Ser Barristan. All I'm saying is that I don't think that it's been hinted at enough on the show for those who only watch the show to know who Prince Oberyn is referring to when he says "for another woman." But I do believe that much will be made of Rhaegar/Lyanna's at some point in the show. I mean, if R+L=J is true, that it will have to be. 
But it's very possible that it's been mentioned on the show more than I'm thinking and I'm just not remembering.

IÂ agree it would be interesting to do it that way round too. Although as a reader, I can't think of a scene from the books not included in the show that I prefer more than the Arya-Tywin scenes (for example). I thought they were pure TV gold - but I am a sample of one.
Â 
I do suspect many scenes from the books not included have been somewhat blown up to mythical proportions partly because they are discussed so much. Were all of the missing scenesÂ really that good on first read? Or does absense (from the show) make the heart grow fonder? Weasel soup is the only one in your list there that I personally was surprised they didn't include.

939	K-26dp	2014-04-10	I really wish I could partition the books and the show in my mind as two discrete entities completely unrelated. That way I could enjoy both with out comparing the two.


Â 
I guess I can do this pretty easily. One is one and one is the other. I consider the books the definitive exploration of the story, and the show is an entertaining interpretation.
Â 
That there can be different interpretations of someone like Tyrion for example is testament to the character. No doubt someday there with more interpretations of the story. Think of all of the interpretations of Frank Baum's Oz books, for example... at this point when something like "Wicked" goes on stage or "Oz The Great And Powerful" goes to screen, does anyone complain that "that's not the way it is in the books!"
Â 
Asking rhetorically, no doubt there's a few out there.
940	aeu	2014-04-10	Â 
This is exactly how I feel. I'll admit that I can't really think of any other series that's been as faithfully adapted to screen as aSoIaF, as far as the plot goes, but it's where the characters come in that I get a bit critical. They've done some absolutely perfectly, like Jaime, Theon, Viserys, Tywin and Davos,Â 


Â 
Â 
This actually illustrates how subjective the whole thing is and why people are going way overboard when they criticize D&D for making changes. Â To me, only Jaime and Viserys in Â that list match their book versions. Â Theon, in particular, is a completely different character in the show. Â He does many of the same things, sure, but that's true for virtually every character (see Jon). Â His appearance, character, reactions are all different. Â Not that this is a bad thing, I think both work well, but it is not a faithful adaptation. Â To a lesser degree, this is true for Davos. Â All the subtlety we get from his inner monologue and backstory are not there. Â My favourite moments from the books that slowly build up his character (the long, brutally honest talks with Stannis) are probably not suitable for the show. Â His reactions are inconsistent with what book Davos would do.
Â 
And Tywin...I love the TV Tywin. I think he is much better and infinitely more interesting than the book version. Â But it is not the same character. Â Someone mentioned the "You are my daughter!" scene upthread. Â Awesome scene, but it is completely different than the books, because the two characters are very different. The words are the same, sure, but book Tywin is not an emotional person who would burst out like that. Â He is also not the type of person who will have long chats with a rude cupbearer (some of the best scenes of the whole show).
Â 
Now, I'm sure some people will vehemently disagree. Â It's only natural, this all depends on out subjective views of characters that have been formed over a long, long time. Â There is really no right or wrong, just subjective opinions. Â People seem to agree to that on principle, but then start accusing D&D with all sorts of things when faced with a change they don't like.Â 
Â 
Â 


Tbf, their job is to make good tv.
They aren't paid to fellate people who have read the books.


Â 
I wish more people appreciated this. Â "the show is better when they stick to the books" is not a universal truth. Â It may be the opinion of many book fans (I happen to disagree), but they are not the most unbiased / reliable source in this matter.Â

Yeah, the changes weren't great overall in that they made Robb look quite stupid, but at least his new wife at least had some sort of character about her, even if she wasn't great. His book wife was essentially a non-character, just there as a plot point.


Â 
I go as far as to say that BOOK Robb is almost a non-character. Almost every major event that Robb takes place in is off screen. And the book romance is at least as eye rolling as the Talisa romance. I felt more for Robb dying in the show than I did in the books.
942	eyeheartsansa	2014-04-11	As I said, everyone who's read the books need no explanation as to what Prince Oberyn was referring to by "for another woman".

Just hearing the word "Stark" would be enough for show watchers to understand the importance of what Oberyn is saying and that it might be something to remember for later on.


Â 
There are nine more episodes left in this season with plenty of opportunities to explain those details. Â If characters just dumped huge amounts of expository dialogue into every scene it would be terrible writing. Â in that moment it makes perfect sense for Oberyn just to say 'another woman.' Â He has no reason to mention Lyana, other than fan service/exposition. Â The writers need to write things that the characters would actually say, and the more different methods they choose to reveal the backstory, the better. Â If someone on the show is curious about who he's referring to andÂ just can't wait for the next episode, there are ways to find out.
Â

I wish more people appreciated this. Â "the show is better when they stick to the books" is not a universal truth. Â It may be the opinion of many book fans (I happen to disagree), but they are not the most unbiased / reliable source in this matter.Â 


Â 
I agree that every viewer deserves to be fellated while watching this show, not just people who have read the books.
Â 
The show is receiving massive critical acclaim and making all kinds of money; it has been more commercially and criticallyÂ successful than anyone might have imagined, and the debut of season 4Â actually broke HBO Go. Â I am not sure what better measure of success anyone could ask for? Â 
Â 
I love the books to pieces and I know the story quite well, and sometimes it is the departures that do it for me the most. Â As a viewer I really enjoy being surprised, and it is amazing that the writers are able to accomplish this for book readers as well. Â Mel's chit chat with Thoros or Jamie's murder of his cousin/cellmate, or Dany's completely different but cinematically breathtaking visit to HOD are high points for me.
Â 
Most recently, Arya's latestÂ freaking awesomeÂ revenge moment is a consolidation of several plot points in the book; the writers had to make certain choices and what they came up with is absolutely, 100% consistent with how we've come to know Arya Stark. Â 
Â 
Xaro's treatment in Qarth, however, not so much. Â The weird subplot between him and Dany's handmaids is probably my least favorite thing they've done. Â I really really think they dropped the ball on Qarth, aside from Dany's visions.

Dialogue for example becomes of prime importance (as inner thoughts cannot be seen) so one requirement of a TV adaption may be to bring characters together for that purpose.
Â 
The qualities of the actors can be different so an actor who is nailing their material should be given more screentime.
Â 
The list goes on. In terms of changes of character from book to screen the only two that bother me is Stannis and Arya. Stannis has beenÂ changed on the show and for the worse.Â Whereas Â I feel that Arya was simply not given enough screentime to properly develop her character (from S4Ep1 that may be changing).Â

945	protar	2014-04-11	A lot of Arya's stuff is just carried by Maisie William's ability to pull off snappy dialogue. The Arya/Tywin scenes are a great example. Often cited as some of the best scenes in the show, they're actually some of the cheapest and shallowest bits of entertainment the show's ever provided. There's barely anything in terms of plot or characterisation - none that makes sense anyway as neither book nor show Tywin would indulge in conversation with a lowly servant from what we had seen previously. Arya is a completely static character from the time she arrives at Harrenhal as well. It's just two fan favourite characters talking in a room together, expected to carry 2/3rds of a season long plot line.

946	Queen of Whores	2014-04-11	^ Agreed. The only redeeming quality those scenes had were giving us some history, like when Aegon burnt Harrenhal and Tywin talking about his father. Other than that they were just filler. Having Roose Bolton there instead would have added significantly more to the plot and his character.

Â 
In my opinion there is very little 'filler' on the show if you are paying attention. Â I also would have enjoyed a scene between Arya and Roose, and look forward to seeing if they meet in the future. Â But someone will probably disagree with the functional purpose of that scene as well.

Â 
Deciding who gets how many scenes and how they are distributed throughout the season must be challenging. Â If there was a spinoff series that was just Arya and the Hound riding around and kicking ass, I'd be first in line! Â It's likely there are a ton of deleted scenes in a vault somewhere that we might get to see one day. Â Really, if people didn't age and TV wasn't so expensive to produce, we could have twice as many episodes and they would still have to leave things out. Â That's why they have to invent scenes so they can develop more stuff in the most efficient way possible. Â Every 'filler' scene is probably accomplishing several goals that not everyone has thought of, whether or not it meets every fan's standards and expectations.

Â 
I wasn't dismissing Maisie's acting abilities. I was simply pointing out that no matter how shallowly entertaining it is to watch good actors trade banter, if it's completely divorced from plot and characterisation then it's poor television.Â 
Â 
Â 
'in terms of function' nothing. Â Most TV dramaÂ isÂ largely dialogue driven, and GoT is no exception.
Â 
Did I say the problem was that it was dialogue? My problem is that it's dialogue that serves no purpose.

Â

Â 
That would be a completely valid point if not for two reasons. One, Tywin's characterisation in these scenes is in complete contradiction to everything we've seen of him before and two, it's a facet of his characterisation which is never going to come up again. It's all well and good to say that we saw another side of Tywin, but so what? What on earth comes of it? Why does it matter that he's got a grandfatherly side? Nothing comes of it and it doesn't matter. As far as season's three and four are concerned Tywin's scenes with Arya might not have existed.Â 
Â 
Yes, lots of this find this entertaining, which is the whole point of watching TV!
Â 
Yes it is entertaining to watch. But a show has to have cohesion. If D+D were to put together a bunch of brilliantly entertaining and yet completely unrelated scenes back to back and pack them into an hour of television no one would be praising it for it's plot. It might make for a very entertaining sketch show but it wouldn't be Game of Thrones. In such a tightly woven narrative - whether it's an adaptation or not -Â everyÂ scene must be both entertaining and must serve some plot function. There is no time for scenes purely devoted to banter.
950	briantw	2014-04-11	Xaro's treatment in Qarth, however, not so much. The weird subplot between him and Dany's handmaids is probably my least favorite thing they've done. I really really think they dropped the ball on Qarth, aside from Dany's visions.

House of the Undying aside, Qarth wasn't very good in the books either.  It was mostly just treading water for Dany while all the characters in Westeros did interesting things.
I do agree it sucked especially hard on the show, though.
951	eyeheartsansa	2014-04-11	I don't think anyone here is qualified to say that ones enjoyment of the show is 'shallow,' what Tywin Lannister absolutely would or wouldn't say/do, or whether or not a scene has any 'purpose.'  Honestly...
I've read the books and I say Tywin can converse freely with his cupbearer on any range of topics to his choosing, and may do so at any time.  What makes you right and me wrong?
I agree Qarth is problematic in the books as well, and this probably much more challenging to adapt.

I wasn't meaning to disparage anyone who enjoyed the scenes. I enjoyed watching them, but the time still could have been used better elsewhere. Why can we not just be honest about what is and isn't shallow entertainment, rather than doing mental gymnastics to justify things? Whether you enjoyed the scenes or not it's a simple fact that they had no impact on the plot and that the characterisation we got in those scenes will never be touched on again. It served little to no purpose in the narrative and ergo is shallow entertainment. If you're fine with the show having those odd shallow scenes then that's cool. No need to paint them as something they're not though.
Â 
EDIT: Also is that really your interpretation of Tywin? Because I'm sensing that it's not, in which case it's simply a strawman argument. Some interpretations of the text are quite simply not valid. Tywin having a kindly grandfather side to him is one of them in my opinion.

Ok, what purpose did the Arya/Tywin scenes serve for the plot? When has Tywin's kinder side been touched on since? None and never is the answer.
955	pwnt	2014-04-11	The Red Wedding was just as I pictured it when I read the book (about 2 years before the TV show)--minus the pregnant wife, however.Â  I didn't like how they had Jaime kill his cousin when he was a prisoner of Robb Stark though.Â  I didn't get why they had to go and do that.Â  But as long as Dany still gets flayed alive by Ramsay Snow like in the books, I'll be happy.

However, the the show is very plot driven...they seem to rely on shock value elements of the books to some extent. The show cannot/has not yet explored some of the more "mysterious," elements that make ASoIaF so interesting. That may change though.

960	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-11	Let's also keep in mind that we also won't ever see the side of Tywin who sleeps with prostitutes again, either. His attitude towards Arya is just as much a contradiction as his attitude towards whores, right? Is it possible that Tywin might be a bit of a hypocrite? People are multi-faceted, contradictory, and more often than not portray different sides of themselves in different situations or circumstances. Nothing about Tywin's characterization in the show seems incongruous with how he's been presented since he first appeared. In a lot of ways, he's quite different than his book counterpart, sure, but that doesn't have any real effect on his portrayal in the show being consistent.Â 
Â 
Those scenes were great: Sharp dialogue; a fair amount of history and back-story, developing Tywin's character (he's more than just a ruthless old man) and Arya further; providing exposition and context for the various conflicts with the northern armies, including Robb; and also providing more information on the formation of the Lannister-Tyrell alliance; these are the main reasons that these scenes exist. It's hard to blame the writers, who had a budget to consider, for deciding to write a lot of enjoyable material for two great actors to perform mostly in a single room with minimal extras. The overwhelmingly strong positive reactions to this material would seem to validate that idea.Â

There are nine more episodes left in this season with plenty of opportunities to explain those details. Â If characters just dumped huge amounts of expository dialogue into every scene it would be terrible writing. Â in that moment it makes perfect sense for Oberyn just to say 'another woman.' Â He has no reason to mention Lyana, other than fan service/exposition. Â The writers need to write things that the characters would actually say, and the more different methods they choose to reveal the backstory, the better. Â If someone on the show is curious about who he's referring to andÂ just can't wait for the next episode, there are ways to find out.
Â 
Â 
I agree that every viewer deserves to be fellated while watching this show, not just people who have read the books.

I completely agree. I was just saying that I don't think the way it was written into the conversation, the line probably won't stand out for those that only watch the show. And like how the show has to find new ways to get certain a things across to the viewer. It makes it feel fresh for us book readers when we're seeing things play out completely different than the books. It's like we're seeing new things just like those who've never read the books.

Tywin sleeping with prostitutes has a huge impact on the plot and retroactively puts his entire relationship with Tyrion in a new light. His kindness (relative to how he usually is) to Arya doesn't have any particular impact on the plot and will never be bought up ever again. You could claim that it's characterisation but I would argue that for characterisation to be valid it can't just happen out of nowhere and never be mentioned again after. Also I personally don't think that D+D where trying to prove any point about Tywin or show a different, softer side of him. I think they just wanted Charles Dance and Maisie Williams in a room trading banter and where willing to bend Tywin's character in anyway to make it happen.Â 
Â 
And again, they were great scenes on their own, very fun to watch. But this seems to be a problem I see with a lot of writers - they put coolness over structure, depth and cohesion. I really don't think D+D cared one jot about plot or characterisation when writing these scenes, they just wanted banter and so far as they're concerned so long as a scene is entertaining in a vacuum that's all that matters.

But what's wrong with that? Many, many scenes in top-notch TV - The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Galactica, True Detective, any Whedon TV are about characters just talking, banter, disagreements, confrontations and so on - much of which doesn't further the plot at allÂ but does build the characters - for us to get to know them.
Â 
The scenes like Arya-Tywin's or Arya-Ned/Jon or Tywin-Jaime do show us a lot about those characters. Whether they match exactly the book characters is neither here nor there. They are still very fun and building layers upon the characters. Not everything has to further the plot and sensibly not every sceneÂ should. As long as other scenes do do some of that so we aren't standing still, and in GoT they have a great balance of plot-driven, character-driven and action-driven scenes (with the very occasional pontless scene admittedly!).

In another show you would be right, but in such a tightly plotted series such as Game of Thrones (and an adaptation) I really don't think there's any time for these kind of scenes. Every scene which is just banter is time which could be used to more faithfully adapt the books which would make for better television imo. And even if this were D+Ds own IP it would still be time that could be spent giving the plot and characterisation that much more depth. I love witty dialogue but in GoT it needs to be slotted into other scenes which serve a functional purpose. Scenes whose sole purpose is banter are just bad writing imo.Â

What does that have to do with the Arya/Tywin scenes (aside from being rather ironic as the only useful bit of information was the stuff about Aegon's dragons)?Â 
Â 
A good writer moves the plot forward, lets us get to know the characters and entertains us all at once. It seems that a lot of the time D+D can only handle one at a time.
969	Red Tiger	2014-04-12	A lot of Arya's stuff is just carried by Maisie William's ability to pull off snappy dialogue. The Arya/Tywin scenes are a great example.

Okay I have a couple of problems with this.
Â 
1. "Book Tywin would not have done this" you say that like it's a bad thing, book Tywin is boring and a lot more shallow than Dance's version. Hell the overwhelming part of the board agrees that Dance's version>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Book version.
Â 
2. The scenes with Arya showed us who Tywin really is when he's not ruling. He is fair to those who serve him and show competence but brutal to his enemies. It also gave us a great understanding of who this version of Tywin really is and whee he came from, FAR better than Kevan Lannister's explanation to Tyrion. Sounds like PLENTY of characterisation to me.
Â 
3. Dance actually told us why Tywin spoke with Arya the way he did.

Â 
In Season 2, Tywin seemed nicer in the scenes with Arya (Maisie Williams). Does he have that in him to be softer? Or was it something just about Arya that brought it out in him?
Dance: Yes, he does, but one very, very rarely sees it. But as far as he's concerned, she's just a servant. Rather like the British aristocracy, they would have the most intimate conversation with servants and really not care because servants are just servants, and it doesn't matter what they think at all. And I think he feels on relatively secure ground to kind of let his defenses down a little and just allow that sensitive side that I believe is there, but it's well hidden and well-shielded."

Â 
Sounds like something that would fit book Tywin perfectly.
Â 
4. Maybe you thought Tywin didn't get much characterization (this is purely personal), but while I was rooting heavily for Team Stark after season 1, after the Harrenhal scenes, I really didn't know who I should root for. Cause Tywin explained the philosophy of power in Westeros perfectly.

971	Red Tiger	2014-04-12	Thank you, people are making it sound like Tywin was teaching her Westerland military secrets or something.
972	Queen of Whores	2014-04-12	It's not as if he was madeÂ tooÂ nice as well, since immediately before one of his and Arya's convos, he tells the Mountain to keep torturing and killing people until they find the truth about the Brotherhood, and cause the people picked the wrong side. A good little reminded Tywin was still a harsh douche.
973	Red Tiger	2014-04-12	That's what im saying. He can be fair, but he can also be unforgiving, which is probably how book Kevan sees Tywin.
Â 
I also think the Arya/Tywin scenes were set up as a contrast to what was going on in Robb's camp. Tywin was brutal, but he kept a tight ship and everybody knew who the boss was ("Have you gone soft, Clegane?", "Can you read?") and he was capable of showing a minimum amount of affability. Robb was heroic, showed plenty of emotion and compassion and stuff (Talisa) but he was quickly losing control of his bannermen.

Â 
Well Charles Dance is great as Tywin I won't disagree with that. That has little to do with what D+D write for him. And I think you'd be in the minority in thinking that Tywin in the books is boring. And even if D+D agree with you, well that just brings it back to my point about an unbiased adaptation. Tywin could be their least favourite character and I would still expect them to write him as close to the books as possible. The same is true if he were their favourite. I don't care one bit about what their personal interpretation of the character is if they mean to tell me by shoving it down my throat.
Â 
The only part which really develops Tywin's character is his single line about his father being weak. The rest is all meaningless fluff for reasons I'll get to in just a sec. Now I'm willing to accept that if we take the show as being it's own entity, then it's notÂ tooÂ incongruous that Tywin would speak to Arya like that. Surprising certainly, but not impossible. But that's not my big problem. My big problem (and the reason the development is fluff) is that this softer side of Tywin is being touted as major character depth and development, but unlike actually good writing nothing actually comes of it. After Arya leaves Harrenhal it's completely forgotten and we see not a hint of Tywin's softer side again. Like I say, it's not an impossible unseen facet of Tywin but it's still potentially quite jarring at first and there's no point in risking breaking the audience's willing suspension of disbelief if there's no payoff.Â Â

Well Charles Dance is great as Tywin I won't disagree with that. That has little to do with what D+D write for him. And I think you'd be in the minority in thinking that Tywin in the books is boring. And even if D+D agree with you, well that just brings it back to my point about an unbiased adaptation. Tywin could be their least favourite character and I would still expect them to write him as close to the books as possible. The same is true if he were their favourite. I don't care one bit about what their personal interpretation of the character is if they mean to tell me by shoving it down my throat.
Â 
The only part which really develops Tywin's character is his single line about his father being weak. The rest is all meaningless fluff for reasons I'll get to in just a sec. Now I'm willing to accept that if we take the show as being it's own entity, then it's notÂ tooÂ incongruous that Tywin would speak to Arya like that. Surprising certainly, but not impossible. But that's not my big problem. My big problem (and the reason the development is fluff) is that this softer side of Tywin is being touted as major character depth and development, but unlike actually good writing nothing actually comes of it.

In the character's defense, what opportunities in King's Landing does he have to show his softer side?
Â 
It's pretty much established that King's Landing is a snake pit full of vultures and spies everywhere. Harrenhal is a place that's ridiculously hard to infiltrate, sure Jaqen did it, but he was a Faceless man. Plus it has a ridiculous amount of halls, while the Tower of the Hand is pretty easy to find by spies.
Â 
Another thing, im not talking about character development, im talking about showing a more human side. I don't expect Tywin to develop cause he's pretty comfortable the way he is, but I think showing his more human side rather than getting it from second hand knowledge like in the books (Genna, Kevan) was a far more potent method.

Well exactly. D+D know that there's no place in the future of the plot for that softer side to have any real plot impact or to rear it's head again, so why bother putting it in? As is, it's a complete non-sequitur even if if doesn't directly contradict what's come before.

Cause showing a more human side is better than telling somebody about it. It wasn't just the part about his dad that made me like this Tywin, it was also about his 'you remind me of my daughter' and Arya making him laugh.

Because it was fantastic to watch. Those scenes didn't need to move the plot forward, that was done elsewhere.
979	Red Tiger	2014-04-12	Also as to why it's important to show Tywin's human side. I believe D+D wanted the viewers to get see that House Lannister was human in one shape or the other. "Well they have Tyrion, Cersei and Jaime", yeah but none of that matters when the top dog has all the power. So it was vital to show Tywin's more human side and show it before Tyrion's trial.

You're just going in circles. Showing is better than telling, but why is this something that needs to be told or shown? Why is it there at all? Also you're assuming that D+D actually intended some deeper meaning when they gave Tywin a softer side. To me it's clear they didn't, they were just warping the plot around Maisie's ability to banter.

The top dog doesn't need to be made more likeable. They've already got Tyrion, Cersei-lite and Jaime in season 3. That's more than enough to show the audiences that the Lannisters aren't just pure villains. And even if for some reason you need to make Tywin more ambiguous, well book Tywin has that anyway. He was despite being a terrible human being a great leader - that's the big piece of moral ambiguity with Tywin, not that he's kind to his cupbearer.
Â 
But anyway, as I said above I think it would be overestimating D+Ds talents to think they had any sort of plan for Tywin with these scenes. Â

When a character does something unexpected and seemingly unlike their previous development that's called hidden depths and it can be very good writing. But when that happens and it never comes up again it's called an Out of Character moment and it's incredibly bad writing. It's not just that it doesn't come up again, it's that combination of incongruity and lack of future relevance.

No it isn't, it's actually a very human thing to do. How often haven't you heard of people who were assholes at work, but friendly when given a perfect opportunity to do so? It's hinted at multiple times in the books that Tywin has similar situational kindness as we see with Arya.

An out of character moment would be Ramsay Snow treating Theon like his best friend for a while. Why? Because Ramsay is a complete psychopath and there's no hints from anybody that he has a shred of kindness.

I'm not saying that people can't surprise us. In fact I said that that could be very good writing if handled well. But this isn't real life, this is a narrative. Everything that happens should be a deliberate choice by the writer(s) to further the story in some way (or to deliberately not further the plot for a specific impact but that's neither here nor there because this isn't an example of that.). If you want to write in something that doesn't quite jel with what we've previously seen of a character, then you've got to seed that throughout the character's past so it makes more sense in retrospect and you've got to have it influence the character's future however subtly. The Arya/Tywin scenes do non of this.
Â 
Let's take one of Tywin's few softer moments from the books - Â his love for his wife. This is incredibly important because it provides a key explanation for just why Tywin hates Tyrion so much, which in turn hints to us that Tywin is a rather flawed, irrational person beneath his cold. pragmatic shell (because it is of course not Tyrion's fault Joanna died birthing him.). And this in turn makes Tywin sleeping with Shae not an out of character moment. Two very similar pieces of characterisation from D+D and Martin respectively. Martin handles it beautifully and lets it inform the plot. D+D just throw it out there to facilitate some snappy dialogue and leave it in the dust once they're done with it.Â

I really thought this was obvious. Also what works in a book might not be very interesting on TV. I love book Sansa for instance, but man oh man I really don't like how the brought over her tv counterpart.
995	protar	2014-04-12	Sorry, but I'm not seeing the difference between your two categories. As I stated previously, good character moments don't need to have future plot relevance or be mentioned again.


Â 
Then I'll try to explain it again. In this conversation there are two different facets to character development: how consistent it is with previous development, and whether or not the characterisation comes up again. This results in a few different types of characterisation moments:
Â 
> The first is your standard characterisation: It both makes sense with what we've seen of the character before, and it has an impact on the plot. This is good writing.
> The second is hidden depths: It initially seems contradictory to the characterisation we've seen previously, but it continues to have some impact on the plot and so becomes part of the character. This is good writing.
> The third is "fluff" characterisation: It's in-line with what we know of the character and yet doesn't ever come up again in any meaningful capacity. Ramsay doesn't just like flaying people, he likes burning them as well for example. This can be good or bad.
> The fourth is an OOC moment: It neither fits with what we previously know of the character and it doesn't come up again. This is very bad writing. Â 
Â 
And it's the fourth category which the Arya/Tywin scenes fall under no matter how fun they are to watch. I do wonder if there's a predisposition to accept OOC moments if they show characters in a positive light. For example let's say that at some point in season 4 Jon beats up Sam unprovoked and this never comes up again. Would that be a good piece of character development?

Â 
Which is why the complete lack of meaningful characterisation in these scenes is so bad.
Â 
ETA: Although actually I would say this is equally plot and character driven. The characterisation drives the plot, the plot provides a space for the characterisation to flourish.

Â 
Have you seen all of season 4 already?
Â 
I would also like to say that I disagree that it falls in the 4th category. Why? Just because we don't see much of it previously does not mean it was never there. Tywin has shown that he could be quite tender, see how he puts his hand on Jaime's face when he sees him in season 1. And a characteristic does not HAVE to have an impact on the plot to be good writing. That is a predictable cliche, not a rule.

I get what you're saying, though you seem a bit doctrinal about it for my taste. Â Why is it poor writing to have an episode with some scenes which drive the plot forward, some scenes which simply entertain, and some scenes which accomplish both? Â You can't go full throttle at all times unless you simply don't care about losing the audience.
Â 
I also think that "entertaining and plot relevant" can be an incredibly difficult needle to thread when adapting books in general, let alone GRRM's material. Â Some exposition and internal monologue lends itself well to the screen, other simply does not. Â To be honest, one of my criticisms of D&D is that they try too hard at times to infuse interest and the viewer ends up missing the point (e.g. - When Tywin tells Arya about Tytos, informing us why he has grown up into such a hard ass, and 75% of the unsullied completely ignored it because they were too busy watching Arya steal his scroll).
1001	protar	2014-04-12	A characteristic does not have to have plot relevance. Hell a CHARACTER does not necessarily have to have plot relevance.


Â 
No it doesn't. But if that irrelevant characteristic doesn't quite fit with the rest of the character you risk jarring your audience for no real reason. A character does not always have to have plot relevance in a novel when there is nigh unlimited space for the writer to play around, but in such a tightly plotted story with a limited amount of time to tell that story every character must serve some purpose even if only a small one. And I think D+D would agree with me there. The only truly irrelevant characters are some of the prostitutes which may as well be extras.
1002	Rashtibram	2014-04-12	A characteristic does not have to have plot relevance. Hell a CHARACTER does not necessarily have to have plot relevance.


Pretty much this. I think this is where the argument we're having stems from. I would justify a moment of characterization which shows the character is a more positive/negative light than usual even if said characteristic never "comes up again:" you,Â protar, clearly would not.

It's poor writing because it implies the writer can't handle a scene having more than one purpose. I mean it's not always poor writing, but it is if they're working with such a tight time limit.

It isn't how many are 'allowed', it's how many to balance this element aganst other elements. They are writing 'something both entertaining and plot relevant' it just doesn't always have to be in the same scenes all the time (and sometimes they do do this when it is appropriate). Honestly, I can't think of a single show in which every sceneÂ would fit your very specific (and unusual) criterea. It would be a one-note, one-pace show, and I don't think that can be right.

ETA: As for Martin going crazy with his prose well it's something I've criticised in the past. But again, Martin has a thousand pages to work with per book. D+D have got 10 hours.


Im starting to see why you love book Tywin, you are just as unrealistically perfectionistic as he is. I really, really don't see a problem with how D+D fill up the 10 hours in each season and I really don't see how the scenes would have been much better.

1011	Queen of Whores	2014-04-12	Okay, this was entertaining to read for a while, but now it's gotten really tedious and boring. Let's wrap up this argument over Tywin's adaptation in season 2 now. Everyone has made some valid points (and I somehow successfully turned my cloak from protar's side to everyone else's ) but this has dragged on too long. Let's everyone just agree to disagree.

But why does that have to be a choice? Does it not say so much about D+D as writers that we have to make that decision about which we would rather see? If D+D were as good as some people say we would never have to make that choice. We would always both.


Â We usually do get both. And more often than in many other shows. D+D do pretty well scaling 1000 pages down to 10 hours.
1014	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-12	I didn't really participate in this discussion, but in the spirit of agreeing to disagree I'll close out with my final thought:
Â 
In musical theater the best songs are the ones which move the plot forward, not just have the catchiest music and lyrics. Â While I certainly think GoT has had some pacing issues and a few too many loose scenes which do little more than fill time, I would also state unequivocally that almost all of the memorable moments from the first 3 seasons advance the plot(s) significantly.
Â 
Incidentally, Â my favorite episode of the Sopranos was Pine Barrens, and my most memorable part was when Paulie mistook a member of the Russian Interior Ministry as an interior decorator, to which Chris replied "His house looked like shit." Â It didn't exactly advance the plot or develop the characters, but it still makes me laugh...

And one I felt that really missed the mark. It appears that certain people are attempting to make a determination on the scenes based entirely on an assessment of the character development of Tywin. Yet, it seems to me that if those same criteria were applied to Arya then the scenes were a home run. Arya was not a prop for Tywin. Tywin was the prop for Arya.

1017	TaenaOfMyr	2014-04-12	I'll say that maybe I'm a bit biased, as I watched the first 3 seasons of the show before reading the books, so its the show that got me into this series, not the books as I'm sure was the case for many of you. But I think D&D have done a great job with the adaption, and I think we're deluding ourselves if we ever think we'll get a better adaption than this. Is it 100% perfect? No. But considering how this could have turned out? Considering how other adaptions of books have worked out (ex. Dune as mentioned by others)?
While there have been areas where the producers have produced mediocre material, I think often times there have been sufficient reasons behind them. For example, the Ramsay-Theon storyline. The storyline involving Ramsay in book 2 was one of my favorite parts of that book and it was left entirely out on the TV show, then season 3 was spent with a long drawn out plotline which was largely just Theon being tortured. Ramsay's identity was kept secret until the final episode, which just was not that much of a TV plotline payoff. Yet I do think the producers had legitimate reasons to go about things in the way they did. It would have been difficult to fit in the Ramsay storyline in season 2 with everything else going on. Completely leaving Theon out of the entire season and telling things later in flashbacks like they did in the books would not have worked out on the TV show. Not narratively and not in an industry where you can have a character of the level of Theon simply be left out for an entire season (likely 2) without having a huge risk that you lose the actor. And keeping Ramsay's identity a secret makes sense when you consider that they wanted to keep Roose Bolton's betrayal a secret and doing so made it more of a shock. I think in general they still err'd with the storyline, but they had reasons for doing so, something that you are going to have in an adaption to this medium regardless of who is doing it.
The show's also shown the ability to improve on certain storylines. Arya's storyline in the show has been a big improvement over the books. We got the Arya - Tywin scenes which weren't in the books. Arya completely wastes her first 2 Jaqen deaths in the books and they made them much more notable and important to the plot in the show. And Arya's storyline drags quite a bit in book 3 before Sandor kidnaps her, and they were able to speed up that storyline in strong fashion.
Its not perfect, but I think they're doing a terrific job.

Yet, it seems to me that if those same criteria were applied to Arya then the scenes were a home run. Arya was not a prop for Tywin. Tywin was the prop for Arya.


Â 
Actually one of the biggest complaints about those scenes and Arya's season two arc in general is that she has virtually no character development from arriving at Harrenhal up until forming the plan to leave. Rather than the constant terror she must endure in the books, she's got a reasonably comfortable position serving Tywin drinks. Ran and Linda go into it a fair bit in their season 2 reviews. I actually bought up the lack of Arya's development earlier in the thread and no one ever replied to it really. I just assumed that we were all in agreement that Arya had gotten no development in those scenes and just moved on.
1019	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-13	Well someone once said this:
Â 

Â 
Then I'll try to explain it again. In this conversation there are two different facets to character development: how consistent it is with previous development, and whether or not the characterisation comes up again. This results in a few different types of characterisation moments:
Â 
> The first is your standard characterisation: It both makes sense with what we've seen of the character before, and it has an impact on the plot. This is good writing.
> The second is hidden depths: It initially seems contradictory to the characterisation we've seen previously, but it continues to have some impact on the plot and so becomes part of the character. This is good writing.

Â 
It seems to me the Arya/Tywin scenes did add to her character on both of these points.
Â 
Sure, I would have preferred her story to progress closer to as it had in the books, but I fear the constant terror would have worked on screen. Many people seem to have had a negative reaction to Theon's scenes describing it as 'torture porn' etc.
Â 
The point I am addressing isn't her arc over the season as a whole, only the claim that the Arya/Tywin scenes were badly written on points that disregarded Arya.

1020	Treekid	2014-04-13	I think the show on his own is very good. I sometimes don't understand why some changes are made but I try not to think too much about the book when I watch so that I can enjoy the show as a separate piece of art.
Â 
And so far I have only felt frustrated at how they handled the whole House of the Undying episode, I liked the reunion scene between Dany and Drogo but hated that they had to have the dragons kidnapped and the thirteen killed and the black guy (can't remember his name in the book) locked in his "safe". I understand that prophecies are difficult to show because we would actually see the characters involved whereas in the book we have to guess but they could have hinted at the RW in a million other ways for instance. I would have loved to see Raegar too.

1021	Lontra	2014-04-13	But it's very possible that it's been mentioned on the show more than I'm thinking and I'm just not remembering.

All I'm saying is that I don't think that it's been hinted at enough on the show for those who only watch the show to know who Prince Oberyn is referring to when he says "for another woman."
Sorry to reply so late but I've been busy.Â  Just so you know,Â  my husband is unsullied.Â  He knew who Oberyn was talking about.Â  He said that he thought there was more to the story because of the way Ned seemed uncomfortable when Robert B. talked about Lyanna and Rhaegar in season 1.Â  He also has suspicions that Jon is her son because of the way that Ned was careful to say "you are my blood" and not 'you are my son' to Jon in season 1.Â  Of course my husband is brilliant ; ), and may not be typical, but it is possible for people to get a hint from the show.
I'm dying to tell him all about it but I don't want to spoil it for him!

Â 
Serving drinks to Tywin Lannister and making eye contact with LF, knowing that people are looking for you sounds pretty uncomfortable / terrifying to me. Â In the book she still has the cushy role of Roose Bolton's cupbearer, so I don't see much difference. Â We see more 'development' in her interactions with Jaquen, especially when she 'tricks' him into getting another death to help her escape. Â I think 'virtually no character development' is an unfounded criticism and if you were to watch season 2 again closely and stop worrying so much about the books or the 'purpose' of every individual scene you might see it a little differently.

1023	Peter George Stewart	2014-04-15	Â 
In another show you would be right, but in such a tightly plotted series such as Game of Thrones (and an adaptation) I really don't think there's any time for these kind of scenes. Every scene which is just banter is time which could be used to more faithfully adapt the books which would make for better television imo. And even if this were D+Ds own IP it would still be time that could be spent giving the plot and characterisation that much more depth. I love witty dialogue but in GoT it needs to be slotted into other scenes which serve a functional purpose. Scenes whose sole purpose is banter are just bad writing imo.Â 


Â 
No, with tv it's more important to get into the characters, the plot largely takes care of itself, and even the ASOIAF plots could be written on the back of an envelope if you look at them in essentials.Â  But if people watching don't engage with the characters, then what they do is meaningless.
Â 
Now, given that, obviously, as many have pointed out, you can't have all the inner monologue that gives us a rounded picture of characters so we care about them in the books, it has to be done through dialogue and visually.
Â 
It's a great adaptation, that respects the books, loves the books, but uses its own medium's storytelling ways to tell basically the same story with basically the same characters, though some are more and some less fleshed-out in the books, and some invented.

Â 
The plot takes care of itself? I don't even know what that is supposed to mean. You're correct that people aren't going to be engaged with the plot if the characters aren't interesting but they're also not going to care about the characters if they're not in an interesting plot. As evidenced by viewers not caring about the dragonknapping plot in season 2, despite Dany being a fan favourite. People say that ASOIAF (and by extension GoT) is a character driven story but it is equally plot driven.Â
1025	Red Tiger	2014-04-21	Well, seems Tywin's kindness to kids is no longer bad writing.
Â 
He didn't HAVE to cover Tommen's eyes, but he did. He could have been harsher with his lessons to Tommen, but he wasn't.
1026	ToTheWolves	2014-04-26	Where is fake arya???
1027	SiddFinch1	2014-05-21	Overall I think they are doing a great job. These are not easy books to turn into Tv episodes. The changes from the books are mostly minor and some changes are actually for the better imo
1028	Petyr Patter	2014-04-15	Did anyone else think the timid prostitute might be the show version of Jeyne Poole?
Â 
The show keeps Jeyne Poole out of King's Landing, but we know she has a somewhat prominent part to play in the coming narrative, though not impossible to write around.Â  Considering the lack of Jeyne's prominence even in season 1 where she was actually cast, a suitable replacement needs to be found and this is the season to do so.
Â 
Thoughts?
1029	averde	2014-04-16	I don't think Jeyne Poole needs a backstory at all really on the show, gets introduced as some girl to be fake Arya. Might even wait till at Ramsays wedding to introduce her at all.
1030	Tixu Oty	2014-04-20	Hmm I don't know. Fortunately, I don't think it would do for her (her name's Myranda btw, I think) to play Jeyne's part when she's been around at the Dreadfort all along. You'd think it would have to be someone sent by the Lannisters or their allies, no?
Btw I'm not sure I like where this story of Ramsay's girlfriend is going.

Wrong prostitute, if "Myranda" is a prostitute.Â  I meant the first girl Oberyn disrobes at the King's Landing brothel, later dismissed by his paramour as "timid."Â

Â 
Oh! I see. It could be though Jeyne Poole or her replacement won't be properly introduced untill next season. By that time, it really won't change a thing to have a new girl or one we've barely seen once a year before. Unless we see more of her this season but I'd say there might be enough going on already to spend time on a character that's not really necessary not has any reason to be entertaining just yet.
1033	milkofthepoppy	2014-04-21	It wouldn't be too out of character for LF to mention something to Sansa if asked about Jeyne. Then viewers might go back and rewatch episode one to make that connection. Dunno, but I think it's very possible that the timid prostitute is Jeyne.

Oberyn Martell "Tell your father the Lannisters aren't the only one who pay their debts" much better in the show that in the trailer
Sansa "I don't pray anymore. It's the only place where none talks to me"
And of course "Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it"

i liked the exchange between Janos Slynt and Jon Snow. "i was lord commander of the citys watch in kings landing!" "and now youre here" or something along those lines
1080	Talleyrand	2014-04-07	Tormund's "Thenns, I fucking hate Thenns" gave me flashbacks to Snatch's "I fucking hate Pikeys" as said by almost everyone in the film

That whole scene was full of like a treasure trove of great lines
1096	hhh	2014-04-07	I thought all of Sansa's lines were great, Sophie Turner delivered them with perfect bitterness disguised as courtesy. Hopefully this assertiveness will crop up again in her future storyline!
1097	Ahri Adaran	2014-04-07	I like Bronn's answer about how he became a knight, "I killed the right people." Love the almost-apologetic act he puts on when he talks to high-ranked people (as in "son of, you wouldn't know him...) while still keeping the snark.

1099	JesterX	2014-04-07	I went to start a topic about this before I saw this thread but I know one of the best MISSED lines from the book.Â  It was from Jaime when Tywin offered him Casterly Rock.
Â 

	Spoiler I don't want your rock!
1100	Faceless Man Friday	2014-04-07	I loved all the lines quoted in this thread. Â I also loved the look on Arya's face as she rode her pony at the end and had to laugh when I saw the Hound was riding away eating a chicken. Â 
Â 
On line I especially enjoyed in that exchange about Needle outside the Tavern was the Hound's comment Â to Arya "of course you would name your sword."
Â 
AND
Â 
Arya's reply to the Hound's comments about her wanting a pony to escape. Â "I just want to get away from your stench."
1101	flamingothegreen	2014-04-07	Every word that came out of the Hound's mouth was epic. o: He's been my favourite character since the first season, so I'm glad he's getting so much loving.
Â 
And of course, "Tell your father I'm here, and tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts."
1102	greywindsrage	2014-04-07	Jon to Slynt "Not very good at your job"
Oberyn Martell "Tell your father the Lannisters aren't the only one who pay their debts" much better in the show that in the trailer
Sansa "I don't pray anymore. It's the only place where none talks to me"
And of course "Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it"
1103	greywindsrage	2014-04-07	Tywin " A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get."
1104	greywindsrage	2014-04-07	Jaime's golden wave. I burst out laughing.


Pure Jamie. NCW is really comfortable in his skin.
1105	Hodor H'ghar	2014-04-07	The Hound killed it this episode.Â 
Â 
"Lots of People name Swords" - "Lots of cunts"
Â 
"You lived your life for the king, you're gonna die for some chickens" - "Someone is"
Â 
"What the f*ck is a Lommy?"
1106	Lord_Baelish	2014-04-07	Most of my favourites have been mentioned already.
Â 
Joffrey: "Uncle, they forgot to write about your great deeds!" He really is a little dick, but the actor portrays him so perfectly.
Â 
Janos: "I was commander of the City Watch."
Jon: "You obviously weren't very good at it."
Seeing someone like Janos get slapped down like that is always satisfying.
Â 
Sandor: "What the fuck's a Lommy?"Â 
Great line and McCann delivered it perfectly, like always.
Â 
This episode really was brilliantly written though. Most of it is easily quotable, and even non-verbal exchanges were well done, like Jaime's wave and Bronn's reaction to Oberyn's offer.
1107	King Tyrion I	2014-04-07	I agree this episode in incredibly quotable. Sandor stole the show with the most great quotes. I loved the chicken lines :-)


Â 
 And the Oberyn one and Tyrion's reply. "I'm recently married."
1108	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-07	Not exactly like that but
Â 
"I've came to say I'm sorry for your husband's death. Renly. Our King" and Marg's face was like "Who?".
Â 
Also Olenna: "You kicked my grandson's ass! I love you!".
Â 


"Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday" *tosses it in the woods*


Â 
Funny thing, his husband and the necklace had the same end
Â 


Oberyn: "I am only the second son after all."
Tyrion: "Well, speaking as a fellow second son..."
Did anyone else catch the subtle foreshadowing here?


Â 
Nice!

1109	Q the Cat	2014-04-07	Is it just me or is this episode the most quotable out of all previous seasons?
1110	ohpooratlas	2014-04-07	So many fantastic quotes.
Â 
I was a huge fan of Margaery's "Maybe I should let Joffrey pick. I'm sure he'll give me a string of dead sparrow heads." -- or some equivalent. It's so rare when we get a real statement from the Tyrell ladies, and Olenna quickly put her back in her place by saying "Careful what you say, even here, even with me."
Â 
Margaery still has much to learn.
Â 
The Hound stole the show though.
Â 
And finally we got to hear about Elia and her children.
Â 
Would have loved Oberyn to tell the story of how he and Elia traveled to Casterly Rock to meet the Lannister twins and how he had "met" baby Tyrion. Maybe in another episode ...
1111	JesterX	2014-04-07	So many fantastic quotes.

Â 
That was actually the most confusing line on the show.Â  There really wasn't any dramatic evidence forÂ Margaery to make that statement.Â Â On the show, Joffrey's always treated her rather well.

Â 
But Sansa already told her he was a monster. And probably, she has heard things. Olenna told Sansa in books that she had heard things about the King, I think.
1113	ohpooratlas	2014-04-07	When she visited him during the crossbow scene last season ... the room had dead animals. Everywhere.

But Sansa already told her he was a monster. And probably, she has heard things. Olenna told Sansa in books that she had heard things about the King, I think.


Â 
I predict there will be a scene this season where Joffrey is particularly cruel to Margaery.Â  As the show has layed it out so far, Cersei is kind of correct when she says Joffrey is under her control.
Â 

	Spoiler Because of that, given what we know from the books about Joff's death, there really is no reason for the Tyrell's to want Joffrey dead. So if they're going to follow the track of the books, they're gonna HAVE to implant some kind of reason.
1115	Cas Stark	2014-04-07	The Hound killed it this episode.Â 
Â 
"Lots of People name Swords" - "Lots of cunts"
Â 
"You lived your life for the king, you're gonna die for some chickens" - "Someone is"
Â 
"What the f*ck is a Lommy?"


Â 
Have to agree here. Â The Hound and Arya are comedy gold plus revenge killing, what's not to like?
1116	WiDMNDBAMMD	2014-04-07	"Maybe I should let Joffrey pick it[necklace] for me...."
1117	intheswamp	2014-04-07	Everything Sandor said.

I think it's more the chemistry between them.Â  They seem to play well on the screen together.

	Spoiler I just hope they don't spoil it when they eventually do separate and do some kind of tv, touchy, feely, kind of thing where they express some kind of affection for each other.Â  I love the way the books did it with her just coldly walking away from him when they both thought he was dying
.
1119	yushkevitch	2014-04-07	Anyone else feel like The Hound's "A man must have a code" line was a nod to Omar Little?


Â 
After everyone is dead cue the sound of someone whistling "Farmer in the Dell" outside the tavern. After a few anxious moments Omar pokes his head through the door, looks around with a subtle frown on his face before spotting Arya standing over her latest victim. Arya looks up at him and blurts out "We're closed."
Â 
Omar smiles, "indeed."

Don't worry, Bronn. It happens to us all.
1126	Seneti	2014-04-07	3. Olenna: "Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday" *throws it away like it's trash*

2. The Hound: "What the fuck's a Lommy?"
Â 
1. Aegon: "I grew up in King's Landing."
Â 
Honorable mention: Drogon snapping at Dany. Not exactly a quote, but that one gesture said so much...
1127	Skeksi	2014-04-07	You know, as a book reader, I've always been pretty apathetic towards the Hound in the books- if anything, I was quite creeped out by his relationship with Sansa (though this may be more to do with how the relationship and it's future is interpreted by certain sections of the fandom, and I know that's not every aspect of his character- the rest is what I was apathetic to ). That said, Rory McCann really brings a lot to the role, and he and Maisie Williams work fantastically well together. They definitely deliver some of the best lines of the episode in that scene, and I really wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. Particularly:
Â 
"What the fuck's a Lommy?"
Â 
And Arya's speech to Polliver, on the more creepy/ dramatic end of things.
Â 
Olenna chucking the necklace into the bush, and Margaery's thoughts on Joffrey.
Â 
Joffrey and Jaime having a snark-off, and Joffrey actually winning.
Â 
Pretty much everything Bronn says.
Â 
Yeah, very quotable episode.
1128	The Giver	2014-04-07	Not exactly a quotable line, but it still jumped out at me:

The way he delivers it is gold.

Grey Worm: "You have no brains" (or something like that).
Dahario: "I prefer to have no brains and two balls".


Â I liked that they are showing how human Grey Worm is. The unsullied are originally depicted as unfeeling robots, and the more he tastes freedom the more we see a normal, emotional person there. This was shown a little bit in the novels too, but more so on the show.
1135	Darryk	2014-04-07	I loved Maester Aemon's "I grew up in King's Landing" line.
1136	ovis alba	2014-04-07	Â We should start a thread, for possible Bronn goat-joke endings....

I am holding out faint hope that Joffrey will reveal the punchline sometime next week after learning it from Mace/Mace's personal guards, much like in the books.
Â 
But then I've been looking forward to Lord Oaf's debut like everyone else was anticipating Oberyn.
1143	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-07	''What the fuck's a lommy?''

''I don't pray anymore, it's the only place where no one talks to me''

Sandor's line about eating every chicken in the room made me laugh.Â

I LOVED Margaery's line about Joffrey choosing the jewellery and it being a bunch of dead sparrows across her neck.Â

The Hound was awesome in this episode.
Â 
Arya mimicking that lannister guard before killing him.
1151	yushkevitch	2014-04-07	It wasn't a line but I liked how the Hound told Arya that she didn't get a horse because "his prize" would ride off. After the tavern scene there she is on her own horse - and I loved the cheeky grin on her face.
Â 
Ah, the little victories in life.
1152	Eve	2014-04-07	Sandor had most of the good lines in this episode.Â  "Fuck the King."Â

1159	Faceless Man Friday	2014-04-08	I overlooked this one before, it was lost in all the other great lines of this episode.
Â 
When Brienne and Jamie are looking down on Sansa in the godswood and Brienne says, "There she is." Â  In those few short words she was saying look at all we went through to get to her, you even lost your hand, you swore an oath, now what are you going to do about it, with the implication that if you don't I will?

After a few anxious moments Omar pokes his head through the door, looks around with a subtle frown on his face before spotting Arya standing over her latest victim. Arya looks up at him and blurts out "We're closed."
Â 
Omar smiles, "indeed."

1167	esperanzafleet	2014-04-08	What the fuck's a Lommy?


Â absolutely this..https://www.youtube....h?v=dLjB8SkUmPI
1168	KeeperOfOaths	2014-04-08	Almost all Jaime's lines were hilarious.
Â 
The best:
Â 
" Jaime: I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife and children.
Tywin: What do you want?
Jaime: Super would be nice"
Â 
And the (I don't remember the exact words):.
Â 
"Tywin: No? I don't remember asking you anything (or something like that)
Jaime: and here is my answer."
Â 
Jaime/Cercei: you can cut your own hand and have the goolden hand in stead if you like it so much/ a hook would have been more practical/ several days working on the hand?/you certainly were devastated when Robert died/it was a very short siege/I wouldn't know what dead cats smell like.
Â 
Jaime/Jeoffrey: Lady Margaery is feeding the people/the war is not won/I use the left hand now, your Grace. Give the other a better contest!! And wih this he shuts Jeoffrey's mouth. Even if he was hurt by what Jeoffrey said, he didn't let him see it.
Â 
Jaime/Brienne. Are you sure we are not related? Died laughing!!
1169	Treekid	2014-04-08	Â 
Arya - "Lots of people name their swords." Â 
Â 
The Hound - "Lots of cunts."
Â 


Â 
Â 
Same here
Â 
I couldn't stop laughing
1170	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-08	This episode was definitely very quotable. I'm thinking since theyÂ are going for major events next episode, they figured they'd pack the laughs in this one.
1171	clairep12	2014-04-08	I had a good laugh at the line by Margaery TyrellÂ 
Â 
"perhaps I should just let geoffrey choose it for me. End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck."

Â 
Â 
I loved this too!  I liked pretty much all of Olenna and Margery, and then Brienne came along.and
1173	eyeheartsansa	2014-04-09	Arya: Lots of peoplename their swords.Â The Hound: Lots ofÂ cunts.
1174	oierem	2014-04-09	Knock on the door...
Â 
Jaime: GO AWAY! / Cersei: COME IN!
Â 
Hilarious and at the same time very representative of how far away they are from one another.
1175	TheSpottedCat	2014-04-09	Not a line, but seeing Joffrey's statue in the garden was priceless.Â
1176	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-12	Jaime- "The war is not won"...
Â 
Â  Yet somehow that line had more power in the trailer...
Â
1177	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-12	No contest:
Â 
The Hound: "I understand that if any more words come pouring out your cunt mouth, I'm going to have to eat every fucking chicken in this room."

Winner winner chicken dinner...
1178	Modesty Lannister	2014-04-13	"I grew up in King's Landing" is the winner for me. I laughed so hard. :-) But, many other moments as well - Jaime waving, the statue of Joffrey juxtaposed with the pose stroke by the real Joffrey, Bronn's every line, and Viper's general air and look when he said: "Decisionsâ<U+0080>¦"
1179	SlowLoras	2014-04-13	everything to come out of the Hound's mouth, especially "what the fuck's a Lommy?"
Â 
Jon's snark was strong this episode - 'are you going to execute me, or am I free to go?'
Â 
'pillow biter' is my new favourite euphemism.
1180	Red Tiger	2014-04-13	"I grew up in King's Landing" is the winner for me. I laughed so hard. :-) But, many other moments as well - Jaime waving, the statue of Joffrey juxtaposed with the pose stroke by the real Joffrey, Bronn's every line, and Viper's general air and look when he said: "Decisionsâ<U+0080>¦"


Yeah that line was priceless and I was like "Okay, can't argue with that logic".
1181	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-13	Less than 10 hours away from some more great lines.
1182	Dany's Silver	2014-04-13	"We've come to a dangerous place" - Shae
Â 
Eddard Stark said the same thing.

Tyrion said the same thing to Shae when they arrived in KL. Living there can be bad for one's health!
1183	Ravi Seaworth	2014-04-13	"How did you become a knight?"
Â 
"I killed the right people, I suppose"
Â 
"Smile"
1184	Kaspiro	2014-04-13	"Someone's forgotten to write down all your great deeds, uncle."
Â 
"There's still time."
Â 
"For a forty-year-old knight, with one hand?"Â 
Â 
Somehow, I think that line to Jaime was the only line Joffrey has ever said that made me genuinely dislike him. Joffrey has actually always been one of my favorite characters, and his cruelty is entertaining. I like the Starks and Tyrion and the rest as well but I don't feel particularly angry when he mistreats them. But dialogue like this, basically unprovoked, to Jaime felt like arbitrary viciousness. I don't even consider myself that fond of Jaime.Â 
Â 
Then again, I guess I've picked a pretty good time to start disliking him considering what happens tonight. Also, that statue was really great.Â

Â 
"We know who you are, we've heard all about you. Hearing is one thing but...*sigh* Aren't you just, marvellous? Absolutely singular! I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he his."
Â 
*Brienne asks for a moment with Marge*
Â 
"You dare not refuse."
Sorry, I mentioned it before but without the actual dialogue

Â 
The Hound: "I understand that if any more words come pouring out your cunt mouth, I'm going to have to eat every fucking chicken in this room."


Absolutely, and the look on Pollivers face after this line when he realises that perhaps the hound is not going to be as keen on him as his brother was. it was like " Oh F**K here we go"
Â 


Anyone else feel like The Hound's "A man must have a code" line was a nod to Omar Little?


Â 
Yes and Omar's other catchphrase
Â 
"It's all in the game" (of thrones)
Â 


What the fuck is a Lommy?


 
Â 


Oberyn: "I am only the second son after all."
Tyrion: "Well, speaking as a fellow second son..."
Did anyone else catch the subtle foreshadowing here?


Missed that, but great catch
Â 
Â 


It wasn't a line but I liked how the Hound told Arya that she didn't get a horse because "his prize" would ride off. After the tavern scene there she is on her own horse - and I loved the cheeky grin on her face.
Â 
Ah, the little victories in life.


someone pointed out on another thread,Â  death on a white horse
Â 


I also love the part where Janos Slynt laughs at Jon when he mentions giants but then looks at Allister Thorne's face and shuts the fuck up.


Â 
He was so pleased with himself at the end of season 1, but now he seems to be smaller at every appearance, really out of his depth now, cant wait for

Frozen smirk Daario was replaced frozen frown stiff Daario. Â And didn't know they had mullets in Essos.
Â 
Â
1194	LordStoneheart	2014-04-07	What? New guy was 100 times better. More suave, more romantic, more like book Daario. Old one was like... cardboard.
1195	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-07	Like I said, douchy Daario > friendzoned Daario. I'm with ya, amigo.
1196	KalibakCruel	2014-04-07	Agree and agree and agree and agree some more. New Daario is not good. Old Daario made sense. He was cocky, arrogant, he had a swagger in his walk, in his smirk. You could see why Dany would be like a little school girl after the bad boy. The way old Daario talked was smooth, natural, like he looked at life in a way the rest of us don't. New Daario is lacking charisma, he seems goofy, his walk is without confidence. And let's not even get into how he now looks like every single other character on the show.Â 
Â 
Old Daario looked cocky and dangerous. He had a confidence in his stance. New Daario looks like he's a pair of thick framed glasses away from the IT division at his local technologies company.
1197	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-07	Well neither are good Daario's IMO. S3 Daario had the attitude much closer to book Daario, S4 Daario reminds me of one of those guys from The Bachelor, good looking rough around the edges type, romantic, booooooooring personality. Where is the complete over-the-top flamboyance though? The whole thing about Daario is everyone is supposed to stop and stare at him when he's around because his appearance and clothing are so out there.
1198	LordStoneheart	2014-04-07	The problem here is that Old Daario was 0% like Book Daario whereas New and Improved Daario has at least one aspect of his character down. Seriously, last season they introduced him because they had to. They went through the motions but now they're giving us a slightly more accurate portrayal.Â

Â 
I liked S3 Daario for the simple fact that I hate Daario overall as a character, and I think his flamboyance and appearance from the book would look beyond stupid on a TV show. S3 Daario at least captures the attitude and arrogance, without looking like a cartoon character.

I agree with you about not liking Daario overall as a character, and so I was all for S3 acting like a smug, smirking, swagger walking douche. And yeah the colourful hair and questionable choices of attire would look very strange on the show. But there needs to be something that makes him stand out. Right now new Daario looks actually a little bit like Jorah with darker hair. So that's going to be weird when Dany is head over heels with him yet cock blocked Jorah hard (no pun intended).

Â Ha yeah I agree 100% with you. He looks too much like everyone else. Medium hair, gruff beard. We get it. That's why I said that old Daario made sense at least. Old Daario was something different, he was oozing confidence, he looked different. Now, it's like, why is Dany so into Daario but so opposed to Jorah?
1205	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	Dany falling for a right knob-head Daario is a cause for frustration that would just compound on the 'Why hasn't Carly See gone to Westeros yet'. They need to make a Daario romance palatable to justify the Meeren Years.Â

Â 
TBH, I think Jorah is more attractive than Daario. I mean, Daario is hot and young, but Iain Glen is Iain Glen. He, "old" as he is, already has a powerful fanbase (along with Jerome Flynn). that's why I didn't hate that Old Daario looks "Fabioish": he was meant to look like these so Jorah would be seen as a minor thing next to him, despite the doucheness.
1207	LordStoneheart	2014-04-07	Â Now, it's like, why is Dany so into Daario but so opposed to Jorah?


Â 
Because she's attracted to him and not Jorah? In the books she's not attracted to him. The show has beefed up his looks. This is the real Jorah, and Dany just isn't attracted to him the way she is attracted to Daario, Iain Glen or not.Â 
Â 
I'm really surprised to see so much love for the bland portrayal we got last year. I barely even remember him. He wasn't smug. He wasn't arrogant. He was repeating lines. New guy has all the swag.Â

Â I know what bear Jorah looks like. But we don't have book Jorah. We have show Jorah who IS good looking. Old Daario made you see a difference in them.Â 
Â 
And I just cannot agree with you saying new Daario has all the swag. New Daario is boring so far. No charisma. Old Daario was known for being douchey and smug. This new guy, despite the episode coming out yesterday, I had to point him out to everyone I saw it with after the episode because not a single person remembered him. New Daario could blend into a background character in any other scene.
Â 
I mean we'll have to disagree obviously, but new Daario sucks lol.
1210	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-07	Â 
Excuse me, but if anybody here is friendzoned, that's ser Jorah Friendzont.


Â 
But this new guy seems like the type of guy who would be friendzoned. Picking flowers for her, playing silly sword games to win her affection, etc. Old Daario was straightforward; "You. Me. Shag. Now." *Hair flip*

even then, why does that mean Dany has to be attracted to him over Daario? Women aren't all attracted to one man. Old and New Daario could be played by Steven Buscemi with a blue wig and I'd still rather Dany be attracted to him over Jorah because that's just how the book goes... Also, I know things in this world are a little different... but don't you think that showJorah is just too old for Dany?Â 
Â 
And yeah, agree to disagree. I see nothing notable in the old guy, but the new one has much better chemistry and delivery.Â

Not at this point in the story. It took a while into aDwD for Dany to accept him as a paramour. He did have to charm her before that. And whats that about the type of guy who would be friendzoned? There's no such thing as the friendzone. There's just guys who are bitter about being rejected.

1212	Blazfemur	2014-04-07	Honestly, they did a terrible miscasting for Daario in season 3. He looked nothing like book daario, blue goatee gold tooth--what?
Â 
However, Season 3 Daario personified the character and played the part perfectly. Arrogant, rude, and skilled as fuck.
Â 
More importantly, Season 3 Daario and Daenerys? Amazing chemistry. You could see the sexual tension. it was there. it lingered. jorah blushed every time they shared a look.
Â 
This Season 4 Daario? Theres like zero chemistry between him and daenerys. And that's a problem.
1213	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-07	I think I would rather have the guy that couldn't act but at least showed some traits of Daario than the guy who now may as well just be a new character. In fact I think i'm just going to call him Mark, he looks kind of like a Mark.
Â 
And wasn't the whole point of Daario in the books to show Dany was still acting like a bratty teenager by falling for the 'bad-boy, i do whatever i want when i want guy', and that we shouldn't take her seriously as a ruler yet? I don't want a Daario that is charming and picks flowers for her and would make a sensible husband for any would-be Queen.

1215	LordStoneheart	2014-04-07	Dare I also point out that this is episode one and he had literally two scenes, one of which was almost a dick-measuring contest (ironic since one was Unsullied) and the other is him trying to make Dany swoon and give her some political ideas... Very Daario like.Â

To me the book and the show are two different mediums. I don't need it to follow it exactly, but if you're going to have it follow, at least have it make sense. I do see your point about Jorah being too old for Dany, I guess that factors into it. New Daario to me is just bland, no swagger in his step, nothing in his face to set him apart from every other character. No smugness, he doesn't look dangerous. I don't know lol. I saw MUCH more chemistry last season than in episode 1. Their exchange seemed forced.

showJorah isn't a bit "aggressive" as bookJorah is. IICR, Jorah told her straight that she should marry him because he would always fight for her and be loyal, right after he kissed her. In show he as also fought for her already three times and protected her and he didn't even spoke and she "you're to familiar"zoned him (bitch). Jorah is more convenient than Daario, at least he's a Lord (exiled, but whatever. Once she's Queen she can have Bear Island back).

All that devotion doesn't mean Dany should feel obligated to love him. He swore to obey her before he showed romance to her... also, his betrayal of her is still not revealed, so there's that.Â

New Daario to me is just bland, no swagger in his step, nothing in his face to set him apart from every other character. No smugness, he doesn't look dangerous. I don't know lol. I saw MUCH more chemistry last season than in episode 1. Their exchange seemed forced.
Â 
Â 
It's WHAT Daario would do, but it's not LIKE Daario would do. And that's my issue.Â 


Â 
I know they're different mediums but it seems extremely stupid to change the story line because one of the actors playing an unattractive and shady morals character is more attractive than the guy playing the character she is meant to be attracted to.Â
1219	The Sullen Sellsword	2014-04-07	Honestly, they did a terrible miscasting for Daario in season 3. He looked nothing like book daario, blue goatee gold tooth--what?
Â 
However, Season 3 Daario personified the character and played the part perfectly. Arrogant, rude, and skilled as fuck.
Â 
More importantly, Season 3 Daario and Daenerys? Amazing chemistry. You could see the sexual tension. it was there. it lingered. jorah blushed every time they shared a look.
Â 
This Season 4 Daario? Theres like zero chemistry between him and daenerys. And that's a problem.


Â 
Agreed... Season 3 Daario was douche-incarnate, but that's what he was supposed to be.

Â 
It wasn't a "terrible miscasting"... It was a deliberate choice. Â The Tyroshi wouldn't play out well on TV. Â It would look silly.
Â 
But otherwise, yes, I agree 1000000% with the rest of your assessment. Â It's essentially what I came here to say, word for word. Â Old Daario was a sexy motherfucker and I hated to love it. Â 
Â 
Plus, New Daario looks like so many boring extras. Â Brown hair, brown beard. Â Come on..
1221	changalang	2014-04-07	Dare I also point out that this is episode one and he had literally two scenes, one of which was almost a dick-measuring contest (ironic since one was Unsullied) and the other is him trying to make Dany swoon and give her some political ideas... Very Daario like.Â 


Â 
You may not point that out because apparently everyone has made up their mind about New!Daario after seeing maybe 5 minutes of expositional dialogue and not much to work with. As a huge fan of Michiel's, it's extremely frustrating to see people writing him off after two scenes, especially because he can act circles around Ed. And I agree, both scenes were great, but subtle - which is throwing a lot of people off.
Â 
I think what it comes down to though is whom you find more believable a match for Show!Dany. S3 Daario? Sorry, but D&D obviously didn't like what they were seeing as they could have locked Ed down, but did not. If he was legally contracted to the show, he couldn't have left for the Transporter movies. Compare that with Michiel being signed for S5 within months of being announced as Ed's replacement.Â 
Â 
Plus, you can moan and groan about the recast as much as you'd like, but they 100% could have put Michiel in a long blond wig. They didn't. Which says that either they would have rather gone with this look from the beginning or that they don't want you to remember the Old!Daario because they're trying to reinvent him. Gone is the brash, OTT arrogance, replaced with a more subtle, nuanced performance, which I'm sure you'll see in the coming weeks.
Â 
Whether that you like that or not is yourÂ prerogative. But don't be fooled - it has nothing to do with the actors. It's how the character is being (re-)written.

1222	darksellsword	2014-04-07	I really wanted to give this new Daario a chance but .He just looks like a dork, he doesn't look fit or strong enough to be a skilled warrior.
Every step he made looked as if he was going to fall over. The tone of his voice was dull and uninspired. I agree with everyone that thinks Jorah is
a lot better looking and charismatic ,next to this guy new Daario is as dull as dish water.Â

Â 
I mustve missed the blue hair and goatee on the new one.
Â 
Looks aside, I felt the Ed Daario had more swagger. More, gods gift to women about him and thats whats Daario is. Hes an arrogant bad boy.
Â 
From the little we saw of new Daario, he seemed to be chasing Dany more. When it should be the other way around and didnt have that same feel to him.
Â 
I think he will improve later, I like the actor playing him, I just dont think he was given enough screen time and perhaps not the best script for this episode.
Â 
Change is always met with hostility.

1224	Sarah Lannister	2014-04-07	Season 3 Daario looked like he'd taken one too manyÂ right hands from the Hound.
1225	The Drunkard	2014-04-07	Old Daario came across like a vain, murderous braggart, and he had that smug smirk on his face constantly. New Daario hasn't done anything to give me that impression yet, with both of his scenes giving me the impression he was more playful than anything (except when he was being a dick to Grey Worm, pretty ballsy to hit an Unsullied under the belt).
Â 
I did not get the impression he was some risk-taking gambler whatsoever, if that's what they were trying to go for with dead-fish's lines.

Â 
Unless he's going to change the way he walks and talks, 5 minutes is all a lot of us needed. Hell, it only took 5 minutes for me to understand that Old Daario was arrogant and that he had the attitude. I could be wrong, but unless new Daario starts looking more dangerous, and starts walking with more swagger, and starts talking with more of a poetic charisma, it's just not going to do it for me. If it does for you, better for you. But for me, I think this is one of the worst, if not the worst casting of the entire series. It's basically just another westorosi as I and others have pointed out.
1228	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-07	New Daario looks way too traditional, there's nothing really remarkable or exotic about him. Old Daario on the other hand, looked remarkably cheesy; he was memorable, but maybe not in the right way
Â 
So overall, my veredict is: *shrugs* I really don't care about that character

Â 
Well in the five minutes I saw of Ed, I didn't like him and couldn't see Dany falling for him, so different strokes for different folks.
Â 
I tried to give him a second chance in the following episodes, but found his acting cues to be horrible and didn't endear me at all to a relationship between him and Dany; probably because I found him creepy and serial killer-y. But again, I gave him a second chance knowing that he would be on the series for a while as one of the love interests.
Â 
Knowing Michiel from his previous roles, charisma and charm is something that you need not worry about with him. But if you're resigned to believe it's the worst casting of the entire series, that's on you.

Not because I believe he's a bad actor, but because I believe he's not the right actor for the role. He just doesn't LOOK dangerous, or smug in any way, and his speech and walk don't seem smug or cocky in the bit either. But I'll concede that it COULD change, I just don't see how.

It's not a question of acting chops though. Hell, you couldn't get much worse than Ed. It's the right role for the right actor, and Ed just happened to be blessed with looking like a slimy cheesy douchebag, i.e Daario. I'm sure Michiel is a perfectly fine actor, but he seems like he would make a better Northerner.

I can definitely see this (him making a better Northerner), but Michiel as Daario is what you've got. And maybe it's just me, but I'd rather give a fine actor another chance, especially with some better scenes, than be stuck with a horrible one just because looks the part.

Except...is Book!Daario supposed to look dangerous? Nope - he's kind of flamboyantly flashy. As for smug and cocky, maybe we just have a different definition of that because I found him to be completely smug and cocky when he told Dany that he and Greyworm were gambling for the pleasure of riding beside her and when he made fun of Greyworm in Valyrian. But that's just me. I kind of like that subtle arrogance, rather than S3's overtness.

I don't know about 100% dangerous, but he's not supposed to look completely NOT dangerous either. His flamboyance definitely is supposed to add a level of unpredictability to him, an edge. Old Daario had that edge. Also, I'm not a fan at all of the subtle arrogance, since he IS flamboyant in the book. Without his over the top attitude, he's just another guy.

Â  Wth that said, s3 Daario made me want to rip my eyes out and smash my tv.Â  S4 Daario... yes not much.Â  So for me, they needed to keep season 3 Daario, because unless this one turns into a huge tool, i won;t have the samer reaction and that just wrong.

Â 
Guessing that D&D might be going in the subtle direction though, from the casting to the dialogue to the look, so Michiel may be perfect for that, but not what you wanted for the character. And I can understand that would be frustrating for many fans, but just another D&D decision.

Thinking that's the point - they want to make the character more likeable? And as above, that might be a pain in the tookus for those looking for that Daario, but makes new fans and those who aren't book purists to see why Dany might fall for him?

Yeah, I can see that. I mean I definitely don't have a say in the show lol, but I do have a voice on the internet to rage to my hearts content. I mean if they made him subtle to begin with, then cool, I'm not a huge "the TV show has to follow the book exactly!" kind of guy. Just not a fan of them making him overtly douchey and all that, and then switching it up, just takes me out of the atmosphere, reminds me I'm watching a show. Kind of a break int he 4th wall for me.

Â 
My reaction to Book Daario and S3 Daario is the same as yours.Â 
Â 
Keeping him like this is a problem for the legions of Unsullied who want Carly See in Westeros 'niaow'. A Daario romance needs to be reasonable and justifiable for the Meereen years to be accepted. To be honest many readers hate Dany's story because of her dalliance with a 'Bad Boy Phase' instead of bloody getting on with it. An acceptable Daario will make her story less cringe-worthy for me going forward.
1240	WTFSalami	2014-04-07	It's always funny to me how everyone can watch the same thing and interpret it completely different. 
I saw ZERO chemistry between Duckface and Dany last season, and who knows what the fuck they were thinking with that wig. It was Cersei season one bad. I like the more natural look of this Daario, although I would have liked to see a subtle blue coloring in his hair, or maybe a large stripe. I HATE how this show tones stuff down. The guy is supposed to be ridiculously stupid looking. He is in the book so the fact that it would look terrible on TV means they nailed it.

Â 
Lol. Low blow.
Â 
Although to be honest, as much as I like Emilia, I think Natalie would act circles around her. Maybe not with the sample size we've seen on GoT, but definitely if she pulled out her Elementary-acting chops.
1243	juanml82	2014-04-07	Old Daario was probably one of the worst performed characters in the season.
IMHO the issue with new Daario isn't the acting, but his image. He looks generic. In the books you could easily see why Danny falls fir him instead of Jorah. In the series... They aren't really that different. I have a hard time imagining New Daario entering the room where Danny is taking a bath. He'd probably ask permission first.
1244	Nictarion	2014-04-07	As a huge fan of Michiel's, it's extremely frustrating to see people writing him off after two scenes, especially because he can act circles around Ed. And I agree, both scenes were great, but subtle - which is throwing a lot of people off.Same here. I loved him on Treme, and was excited when I heard he was cast on GoT. The last guy was a rapper/actor who is nothing special. Michael Huisman is an extremely talented actor.
1245	BlueDragon	2014-04-07	Emilia is at the beginning of her career. Â Natalie has tons more experience. Â It was a good casting choice as Dany's confusion and passivity in the beginning was appropriate to the character. Â I like Natalie, but as she is usually playing a wise cracking and slightly cynical character, this role is nothing new for her.
Â 
Natalie knows how to manipulate, her character that is. Â Dany is less interested in that and more interested in addressing people directly in the merits/demerits of their personalities.Â 
Â 
It is easy to forget how many of these actors are just starting and playing against big guns.
Â 
Of course, Maisie is a phenom. Â She is going to be the next Jennifer Lawrence/Meryl Streep.
Â 
Try to imagine Emilia and Joffrey. Â He would go at her with a sledgehammer; she would sidestep and he would be on fire before he even noticed it. Â Dany aims at the weakness; Margerie misdirects it. Â Misdirection seems more subtle, but it has some real disadvantages, i.e. things can go really, really wrong.Â

Â 
Seems like we're the resident Michiel fans here. And as the two of us know all too well from S1/2 Sonny, he can play a huge douchebag/jerkwad when he wants to. If that's what D&D want from him, I'm sure we'll see that.

But I'm still leaning towards the idea that they're trying to totally 180 his character, which I will admit could be very annoying for fans, but makes more sense to me in regards to Dany falling for him. That's just me though!

Ha yeah I mean at least you're used to him so the recast is good for you. Ed was by no means a good actor, but I just got used to him and the overtness. I just hate being taken out of the moment. I hope he grows on me, those scenes will be a lot more enjoyable if he does.

Â 
The issue is, I think, at least for me (and some others) is that people hated book Daario and thought it made no sense that someone who looks like a stupid clown is the guy that Dany falls hard for like a schoolgirl in love. And going to my OTHER point about the recast taking me out of the moment and reminding me I'm watching a show, making Daario all cartoonish and stupid would definitely take me out of the moment. I hate Daario in the books, the relationship doesn't make sense to me as it is in the books, there's no need to add a cartoon element to the show.

True enough, but I found Natalie to be wonderful on The Tudors when she was just mere years into her acting career. I agree that Emilia plays her softer scenes very well, but sometimes I find her more powerful "Khaleesi" scenes a little lackluster in terms of ooomph. Just compare her to Maisie's scenes last night. As you said, she's a phenom and stands tall among her more experienced counterparts.
Â 
Speaking of, I was having a conversation with another fan last night and was saying how blessed the show is to have such wonderful "child" actors. They really do command their scenes, even with living legends like Charles Dance. I'm just impressed by the quality (and quantity) they were able to find with Maisie, Sophie, Jack, and Isaac.

1252	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-04-08	To clarify, I'm not just hating the new "Eric Bana from Troy" Daario. Â  I also hated Ed Skrein on the show. Â My first thought after hearing that Rapper Daario got dumped was, "Thank god." Â (Even thought I'd never seen Michiel before. Â I was sure he'd be great.)
Â 
As I think about it, I look at the Daario problem like this:
Â 
1) In general, the show seems to struggle with male "exotic/flamboyant" characters from the books. Â They clearly don't want to have lisping, purple haired men with gold teeth running around. Â (Although blue lipped Pyat Pree was okay, as was slapping eyeliner on Khal Drogo.)
Â 
Lispy painted "Bloody Mummer" Vargo Hoat became..."Locke," generic medieval villain.
Weepy, overdramatic Xaro Daxos became... scheming, masculine, ernest Xaro.
Lustrous haired, widow's peaked Oberyn became... short haired Pedro Pascual. Â (He's gonna be great!)
And Purple haired, gold-toothed Daario became.... a grinning rapper, then mumbling Eric Bana from Troy.
Â 
When I first heard the new Daario, I honestly thought, "Is Nashville one of the free cities?"
Â 
2) I think D&D are actually admitting they not only cast Daario 1.0 wrong, but WROTE him wrong. Because with Eric Bana Daario, it's not just new casting, it's also new writing. Â Which for me, also doesn't work. Â (Not saying I have the magic answer, just that they're still struggling to find it. Â And maybe this is one character that just doesn't translate to the show.)
Â 
If "subtlety" is the new plan...perhaps we should do something other than handing a woman a bunch of flowers while explaining what each one means.
Â 
"You ARE a gambler." Â Is this an episode of Dallas? Â I almost expected him to call her "ma'am."
Â 
In short, I don't really miss Rapper Daario, but I sure don't like Eric Bana from Troy Daario, either. Â I hope the writers help him out better than they did in Episode 1.Â 
Â 
This is all nitpicking, since 99% of the show is brilliant. Â But the weak parts really do stand out because the rest of it is so good.

Â 
I completely agree with you, especially regarding point 2. And yes, there was nothing subtle about the dialogue in that second scene.
Â 
However, as I've probably stated too many times already (can you tell I'm a fan of his? lol), I think Michiel's direction was to be more subtle in his movement and looks and, well, everything. I too hope they give him more to work with because I think his talents allow for much more range - whether that's being arrogant, a douchebag, charismatic, or whatever - than what he was given in the season opener. And I'd much rather see this as well, rather than a completely subdued Daario.

1257	ground_control	2014-04-08	1) I can't stand book Daario -- looks like a clown, acts like a clown, but somehow Dany doesn't notice?
Â 
2) S3 Daario actually made me believe the book Daario could work
Â 
3) S4 Daario Â -- not a bad character, just not a character from the book. Â Seriously, I don't recall reading about Jorah Mormont's younger, good-looking brother.
Â 
4) Nothing I've read indicates that HBO / D&D chose to replace Daario; given how much better S3 Daario is than the new one (and how much less book-like S4 Daario is), I wouldn't want to insult the show by saying somebody did it on purpose.
1258	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-04-08	Regarding "People fear change" - Poor Ian Whyte was promoted in S2, then demoted for S4 from The Mountain. Â And no one feared that change. Â Yes, Conan was perfect, but this new guy.... pretty damn close.

Â 
Ehhhh. It's debatable.
Â 
Michiel was cast quite a bit (and signed on for S5 too) before Ed was announced as the lead of the new Transporter reboot. I've heard rumours of Ed being difficult on set and/or wanting more money, and I'm not just saying this as a fan of the new actor. But that's neither here nor there.
Â 
Like I said, the purposeful recast of a completely different looking actor (plus not adding that blonde wig), the writing in those first two scenes, etc. - seems to point towards D&D choosing to go another direction with Daario for S4 and beyond. But that's just me analyzing the situation from my POV.

It was Bana's breakout dramatic role. Previously he was known for comedy work. The movie is a biopic of a 'colourful Australian underworld figure' - Mark 'Chopper' Read.Â

Â 
That's because he didn't actually have any lines of note. He's a physical presence. And there has been plenty of complaining about how they've butchered the Mountain's role around here. They have one last chance to set it right though. So yeah, it definitely does come across as people just fearing change in regards to new and improved Daario.

I don't know what you mean by "fearing the change". Â The change has happened, and we've seen it, so there is nothing to "fear". Â IMO, S4 Daario is in all ways inferior to both S3 Daario and Book Daario (who I think is arguably the worst written character in the books). Â Daario's "look" is big part of his character, and the new Daario looks like Jorah's younger brother, and unless the costuming changes in later episodes, the dialog/acting is unlikely to overcome that defect.
1264	MarieAntoinette	2014-04-08	So far I prefer season 3 Daario. I can see why some people could not stand him, but isn' that kind of the point of the Daario character? New Daario seems quite calm and like a regular guy. I also find it distracting that he looks nothing like the old Daario, they changed his entire look.

"Fearing the change" is exactly what you've expressed in your comment. Daario's look might have been a huge part of his character in the book and in S3 Daario, but D&D seem to have decided it's no longer a be-all-and-end-all for the character on the show, as illuminated by the lack of a golden wig. You're fearing the change of his look because it isn't as you've experienced it before. That's what the sentiment means; I swear I'm not trying to be condescending.
Â 
As for being in all ways inferior, not sure that's possible re: acting because as even the OP said, he was horrid.

					
					
							Edited by changalang, 08 April 2014 - 01:19 AM.
1266	BlueDragon	2014-04-08	To be clear, I know the new actor is just fine and very believable as a sexed up pursuer of what he wants. Â 
Â 
I've never seen such a total lack of continuity in a series to the point that one feels a new character has been injected with the same name.
Â 
I found zero chemistry there.
Â 
Maybe he won't become her lover in the show version, and it will all work out, sort of.
Â 
I didn't even believe new Daario had the least attraction/devotion to Dany and that is inexcusable. Â Handing her a bunch of flowers with a lecture about strategy doesn't make sense on any level from the relationship point of view.
Â 
I found the earlier actor to be doing a good job in the douchebag category which fit just fine with the book character. Â 
Â 
And I don't read Daario as being unnecessarily aggressive and insulting to Grey Worm, at least not the Daario of last season. Â Daario is concerned about himself and his pleasure. Â (I am forgetting the Daario of the books for the moment). Â 
Â 
Neither did Dany display any of the titillation she did at the end of last season when she asked where is was with concern after she had sent them into the city to take it. Â 
Â 
He didn't even look at her and project any chemistry at all from his end. Â 
Â 
This was bad writing, bad decision making and bad direction. Â Since everything is in the can, we can only hope they picked up on it and did something.
Â 
and by the way, I remember the book as establishing Grey Worm as brother to Missande. Â It is easy to get things wrong, but this is what I remember. Â I think Daario was picking up on his interest in his sister.
1267	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-08	I think it's overtaken Renly as the worst cast, written for, and handled character of the series so far. D&D have done a superb job, but certain character types they can't quite grasp and it seems to be males that are flamboyant and effeminate(sp?) but also taken serious as leaders or warriors.
1268	ground_control	2014-04-08	Â

You aren't getting the point -- "fearing change" is an anticipatory behavior. Â I waited until after I saw the change to comment about it, so it is simply not possibly "fearing". Â I have seen the change, and I do not like it.

Â 
Actually if we're talking semantics, "fearing the change" (which is what I was referring to) as a phrase puts "the change" into the present; which is what I was describing.Â "Fearing change" as you said in your comment is anticipatory. Two different meanings, which is why we're probably both a little confused at each other's comments.

Â 
Looking up at the comment, I see the error of phrasing it this way. I don't mean fearing change, I mean disliking change just because its changed. This new guy is extremely better considering the last guy had minimal lines and a wooden delivery of them. New guy seems to exume a subtle confidence and attraction to Dany that the old guy did not have. And his looks are much more natural-looking than last year's wighead.Â 
Â 
Also, I definitely think judgment should be reserved for more scenes with him other than these two we got that were closer to book Daario than last season.
1272	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-08	I like the new one better, although he should play it a little more smarmy.Â 


Â 
Agreed!
Â 
I think I'll reserve judgement until I see him champion for Dany. I think that will be the "make it or break it" scene for me. I don't really care for looks, as long as I get a sense of character.
1273	AugustusCaesar	2014-04-08	Reading the books, I thought Daario was supposed to be a "badboy", hence why Dany fell in love with him. I don't get that feeling at all with the new Daario. It was a horrible choice from HBO to pick this actor, but I will wait and see to make a final remark.
Â 
Â 
Does anyone know why they dropped the old Daario? Contract issues?

Â 
Yes, he was Dany's 'badboy' phase in the books - and it was problematic because it turned people off her. Viewers are already frustrated that she isn't in Westeros yes. Having her go through the same 'bad boy fling' would just pile more frustration on. They need the romance to appear to be a justifiable cause for her delay.
Â 
Lots of rumours including his wanting more money but nothing officially stated and unlikely to ever be anything released on the matter.

No need to reserve judgment when the evidence is already before us. Â I just think the new guy makes a lousy Daario. Â S3 Daario had an exotic enough look without being the clown described by Martin, and pulled off the bad boy attitude well enough. Â S4 Daario looks like a random Westerosi extra, and I get no "bad boy" vibe from him.
Â 
It doesn't help that his scenes are pulling down Grey Worm, either.
1276	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-08	Does anyone know why they dropped the old Daario? Contract issues?

He inquired after Conan Stevens.

1281	Iron Victory's Captain	2014-04-08	Could it be that they changed the actor in somewhat of a more 'likeable' guy because the HBO series will have a different ending than the books?
I can't help but think that the HBO version will push Danaerys as the ultimate hero-queen of Westeros (vs the White Walkers) and to keep her image clean she needs a prince who is liked by the general public.
1282	Xcorpyo001	2014-04-08	I think the different opinions we have here stem mainly from the different views we have on the book version of Daario and what our expectations for this character was.
If I where to express all my aspirations in one phrase, it would have been something along the lines of: I want someone that can be in par with Khal Drogo, since after all, this guy is the first one Danny has the hots for since her late husband.Â 
Â 
From my interpretation of the book, Danny saw Daario Naharis as a acceptable choice for a sex partner/lover for many reasons: his flamboyance, his bad boy attitude, the fact that he treated her as a woman, and not a god/queen/child like everyone else, prowess in battle, bla bla bla.Â 
Â 
So let's have a look at the three Daario we have so far:
Â 
1. Book Daario.Â 
Three pronged beard painted in different colors, gold tooth, golden mustache, the hair, the even more flamboyant clothes, gaah.
First impression: "So this is how a mix between a pirate and a clown would look like(25%pirate, 75% clown), and the same mix in attitude to go down with it."
Book Daario is a great way to present the rich culture of the Essos continent, but not much lover material, at least not in the looks department.
I always thought Danny, which is a young girl ruled by her hormones at this point, will chose some good looking guy to have some shallow torrid love affair and dump his ass shortly after, and will stop short of having sex with the pirate clown, but GRRM proved me wrong.
Mega huge downgrade from Drogo.
Â 
2. TV Daario 1.0
First impression: "Gods be praised, he's not a clown"
Second impression: "Crap, his face is stuck in one expression, must have studied at the Stalone Arts School, but hey, at least he's not a pirate clown"
Good fighter, attitude close to the one in the book, the only single guy in Westeros and Essos that doesn't have to pay for sex, some chemistry with Danny(would have been more with some better acting)...the perfect guy for a fling/one night stand.Â 
I could see a teenage hormone ruled Danny falling for this guy, and the fact that 99,(9)% of the male population surrounding her is made out of eunuchs is a big plus for him
Still a downgrade from Khal Drogo.
Â 
3. TV Daario 2.0
First impression: "Ohh, I did not knew Jorah had a younger brother!"
Second impression: "Wow, dude looks old"
Third impression: "This is not my Daario!!!!"
The guy does not stand out: too northman, too bland, too average looking guy. Clown or no clown, the guy needs to stand out, and this one fails in that department
In the looks department, he has a beard, which is a plus. The beard is not painted like a damn rainbow, which is another plus, at least from my point of view.Â 
As for his scenes, lol. The only "chemistry" Danny and him had was in his lecture(a freaking lecture..so hot) about plants and their medicinal properties. If not for that beautifulÂ blue roseÂ he had in his hand, I would have skipped that part. He almost ruined that awesome moment for me as well.
Â 
Honestly, the only way this guy could be hot is if someone put him on fire.
Maybe it's because I'm a straight guy and don't have the same scale for grading dude hotness the girls seem to have.
I won't even try to compare him with Khal Drogo..it would be like kicking a puppy.
Â 
Many people here joke about Jorah being stuck in the friend zone with Danny. Well, in that scene with the lecture about flowers and their medicinal properties, Daario 2.0 managed to surpass even that standing and landed in the wise councilor/father figure zone(the age difference helped him here), which is far far worse.
Â 
If I were to put odds on Danny spreading her legs and doing a meereenese knot for any of the people in her party, it would be:
(Khal Drogo(RIP)>)MIssandrei(yup, I went there)>Daario 1.0>Jorah>Grey Worm(+sex toys)>Daario 2.0>Selmy>random unsullied(+sex toys)>random slaver>random slave>Pycelle>book Daario(yup, I really don't like clowns).
Â 
What do we say to the chance of Daario 2.0 getting out of that huge hole he dug himself in and become every women's expectations about how the perfect lover should look/act: not today!
Â 
So far, from the three Daarios we have so far, TV Daario 1.0 came closer to my expectations of how TV Daario should look like, not because he's better, but because the other two are a worse pick for what I want to see. But then again, there are a lot of different opinions, and maybe someone actually hit the jackpot and got their dream Daario with this one.
Â 
Anyways, the guy is a good actor, and I guess it could have been worse.
1283	Darryk	2014-04-08	New guy is way better IMO. The old guy was all smug arrogance, the new guy is roguish but likeable.
Â 
Obviously Daario from the books isn't a popular character so a lot of fans don't actually want him to be likeable, but it works better for the TV show since he is going to be Dany's love interest.Â
1284	El Guapo	2014-04-08	I think we also have to remember that tv Dany is about 4-5 years older than book Dany and it is quite possible that the showrunners felt that having tv Dany being attracted to a clownish "bad Boy' book Daario wouldn't translate well to the show. Â If that is the case I agree with them. Â
1285	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-08	Where's his flamboyancy?? They're making him ''nice'' and Daario isn't nice, he's a confident, showy, asshole who Dany wants because he oozes his own sort of charm. This guy is just nice....
Â 
WHY IS THERE NO BLUE STREAK AT ALL FFS??
1286	Cas Stark	2014-04-08	I think we also have to remember that tv Dany is about 4-5 years older than book Dany and it is quite possible that the showrunners felt that having tv Dany being attracted to a clownish "bad Boy' book Daario wouldn't translate well to the show. Â If that is the case I agree with them. Â 


Â 
I don't know about "clownish" but women of all ages continue to be attracted to good looking bad boy assholes. Â LOL. Â Ed wasn't even clownish. Â This guy is drab, he's the Westerosi version of a red shirt.
1287	toffeejay	2014-04-08	Reading the books, I thought Daario was supposed to be a "badboy", hence why Dany fell in love with him. I don't get that feeling at all with the new Daario. It was a horrible choice from HBO to pick this actor, but I will wait and see to make a final remark.
Â 
Â 
Does anyone know why they dropped the old Daario? Contract issues?


Â 
Aparently they had to go back overÂ all ofÂ his scenes and edit and redub his voice because his accent changed in every scene. Supposed to have been a complete nightmare for the sound team. (could have fixedÂ Littlefinger while at it!)
Â 
Season 3 looked like a Ken doll who'd just had electric shock therapy. Awful actor.
Season 4, looks the part of sell sword, better actor but... he's just not got anything that the character needs. Just to dull.
Â 
Not impressed with either but at least its a character nobody likes anyway.Â
1288	Darryk	2014-04-08	Could it be that they changed the actor in somewhat of a more 'likeable' guy because the HBO series will have a different ending than the books?
I can't help but think that the HBO version will push Danaerys as the ultimate hero-queen of Westeros (vs the White Walkers) and to keep her image clean she needs a prince who is liked by the general public.


Â 
Or maybe they recast him because they know where GRRM intends to take the story. Since we have no idea where Daario's arc goes, we can't know whether they've changed him because they intend to take things in a different direction, or because they're simply sticking to the plan laid out for them by GRRM.
Â 
I don't think the show will have a different ending from the books, and people are exaggerating their "whitewashing" of Dany anyway. The show simply hasn't gotten to the stage where her character becomes darker, and she's nowhere near as dark in the books as many make her out to be anyway.
1289	Phonzadellika	2014-04-08	Old Daario was better. New Daario is terrible so far.

They could have made the transition a little easier by putting a blonde wig on new Daario and making him shave so he at least sort of, from a great distance through a muddy window, resembles old Daario to make his initial appearance in the show less jarring.
Â 
That said, Old Daario had the attitude right. It's a shame he's gone.
1290	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-08	Yeah, the way he was just there and they were just calling him Daario like nothing had happened was so jarring, they could have had a small scene with him doing something to his hair at least, ugh.Â
1291	Cas Stark	2014-04-08	Ed wasn't that good of an actor, but he did get the roguish charm and over the top personna part of the character right.
Â 
Daario 2.0 is so bland, if you are going to go for a super bland guy with no personality, just have at it with Mormont, he's actually got more charisma.Â
1292	Jehanne	2014-04-08	I'd have to say Dario 1.0 was better, too.
Â 
Dany is a larger-than-life character- mother of dragons, has a destiny, etc
Â 
Dany would only fall for someone else who is "different" and stands out, and Ed Skrein did.Â  He was gorgeous, and had a great voice with a very sexy accent. He seemed arrogant and somehow untouchable, like Dany.
Â 
This new Daario, I'd have to agree with someone else's post, looks a pair of glasses away from some company's IT department.
1293	Rhaquentis	2014-04-08	I could care less about his appearance, but as others have said, he lost his SWAG! There are still plenty of eps to go though, so here's hoping :/
1294	-Ghost-	2014-04-08	It's been 1 episode. Hes had like maybe 3 minutes of screen time. Huisman is a pretty good actor so I'm gonna give him more than 1 episode before going crazy.
1295	Cas Stark	2014-04-08	It's so typical of D&D that they perfectly cast Drogo, the character with hardly any lines where everything depends on screen presence and chemistry.
Â 
Yet they can't seem to cast properly, now after two tries what amounts to a completely stock Hollywood type: dashing Errol Flynn pirate type.
1296	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-08	Yeah, I wasn't crazy about old Daario. Â He wasn't that good of an actor, but he did have the Daario swagger. So far, I'm unimpressed by new Daario though I'll completely reserve judgment until I see him interact with Dany again. He was bland and boring and then introducing him next to Grey Worm was a bad idea b/c I can never take my eyes off of the actor who plays Grey Worm when he's on the screen, so I scarcely noticed new Daario at first. Â 
Â 
As I said in another thread, I just keep picturing the guy who plays Capt. Hook on OUAT as the type of man or character that Daario should be. This new dude is not selling it. Â Old Daario almost sold it, so it would have been better to stick with him and work with him on improving in some of the areas that he lacked.

1297	Glasgowchivas	2014-04-08	It's far too early to be talking about whether this recasting is good or bad guys. The guy has had about 10 lines and 4mins of screentime. Let's reserve judgement until we've seen him a bit more, eh?
Â 
I have a feeling that the people who aren't won over will change their tune when he duels with Mereen's champion.
Â 
For the record, I thought Ed Skrein did a fine job as Daario; he was cocky and believable as a sellsword. I had no trouble believing that Dany would fall for him or that he'd be the type to behead his friends on a whim but alas, he's moved on to the Transporter franchise so we've got a new guy. Let's just give him a bit of time before we break out the pitchforks, eh?

Â 
I was kind of thinking the same thing...its a bit of a bad sign when the guy playing the unsullied eunuch is more charismatic than the guy who is supposed to ooze charisma.
1299	King Tam Stark	2014-04-08	They should have kept the other guy, Old Daario, and make new Daario to warg him.


I read it was Ed's choice to leave the role as he is to play the lead (Frank Martin) in the new Transporter movie.
1300	FakeJaqenH'ghar	2014-04-08	I like Ed better at this point, but that's going off of what...5 minutes of new Daario? New Daario exhibited little to no personality. He honestly looks like he belongs at Castle Black with the Brothers of the Night's Watch. There seems to be more of a darkness to him, unlike the colorful flamboyant Daario we all probably expect to see.
Â 
Luckily for us, we have opportunities over the next several Sundays to solidify our opinion on the recast.

Huisman was announced as Daario in August 2013
Â 
Skrein was announced for Transporter in February 2014
Â 
What you read was an assumption at best.
1302	barmyscouser	2014-04-08	Â 
Because she's attracted to him and not Jorah? In the books she's not attracted to him. The show has beefed up his looks. This is the real Jorah, and Dany just isn't attracted to him the way she is attracted to Daario, Iain Glen or not.Â 
Â 
I'm really surprised to see so much love for the bland portrayal we got last year. I barely even remember him. He wasn't smug. He wasn't arrogant. He was repeating lines. New guy has all the swag.Â 


Â 
You're getting warmer. Â But even that pic shows Jorah with too much hair on his head and not enough on his knuckles. Â For book Jorah I'm partial to this one.
Â 
The sad thing about the love scene at sea between Dany and Jorah is that she looked up to him as a kindly uncle. Â So she really wasn't expecting his tongue.
1303	RoamingRonin	2014-04-08	He's too hairy.
1304	JesterX	2014-04-08	Old Daario seemed to fit the character more.Â  Also, there was a better chemistry going with Emilia Clarke and Ed Skrein.Â  You could see it from her very first line to him and the way she said, "you're very young for a captain".
Â 
Not the same thing between Emilia and this new guy.Â  The attraction the two are supposed to have seems forced, not natural.Â  At least that's the feel I got from them.
1305	ground_control	2014-04-08	It's far too early to be talking about whether this recasting is good or bad guys. The guy has had about 10 lines and 4mins of screentime. Let's reserve judgement until we've seen him a bit more, eh?

1) It is not "far too early", there is *no* need to reserve judgment. Â Most of Book Daario's "character development" is Martin's apparent attempt to discredit the little known "clowns are sexy" trope by focusing on Daario's appearance and attitude. Â S4 Daario looks like Young Mormont, and that isn't going to change no matter how well he reads his lines.
Â 
2) While I understand the show's need to consolidate characters, and will wait to see how well they pull off the duel with Mereen's champion, in the book that scene is done with Strong Belwas, not Daario. Â So my opinion on Huisman's performance in that scene will be judged against Belwas, not Daario.
Â 
3) I don't see any pitchforks. Â Book Daario is a crap character, S3 Daario actually being tolerable was (IMO) a Herculean feat, and S4 Daario proves that by showing how far down the ladder the next-best thing D&D could find is.
Â 
I get that not everybody dislikes S4 Daario, this is art, so there will be differences of opinion. Â But the people telling other people to "keep waiting, maybe it will get better" are the ones engaging in anticipatory behavior.

Well in the five minutes I saw of Ed, I didn't like him and couldn't see Dany falling for him, so different strokes for different folks.
Â 
I tried to give him a second chance in the following episodes, but found his acting cues to be horrible and didn't endear me at all to a relationship between him and Dany; probably because I found him creepy and serial killer-y. But again, I gave him a second chance knowing that he would be on the series for a while as one of the love interests.
Â 
Knowing Michiel from his previous roles, charisma and charm is something that you need not worry about with him. But if you're resigned to believe it's the worst casting of the entire series, that's on you.


I'm reserving my full judgment for after I see him in another couple episodes, as there wasn't much material for him to work with, but thus far I totally disagree with you. Firstly Michiel's acting chops have absolutely no bearing on assessing the scenes we witnessed today, and whether or not he's good in other productions doesn't necessarily mean he's the right fit for this role (he certainly doesn't look the part). His scenes were dull, and his delivery was anything but "accurate" to the character, as some defenders of the recast are arguing. Daario is flamboyant, he's suave, but he's not subtle. What sets him apart from other characters is that he says exactly what he thinks and knows exactly what he wants and how to get it. Ed Skrein might be a quote on quote "bad actor", but the fact is that his performance, perhaps due even in part to his limited professional training, actually came off as far more natural and electrifying than what I saw on Sunday night. Even if Michiel is more competent at conveying lots of subtle dimensions of a character, the fact is that Daario actually has a bit of a one track mind, and Skrein nailed the shit out of it. More than anything else, however, Michiel's scenes had very little chemistry with Clarke (though I recognize there wasn't enough time to really make a definitive judgment on this). This is what I think is going to cause problems, unless they're really able to synch up after more screen time. You can say what you want about Ed, but the spark was there from the minute he walked into her tent with the Titan's Bastard.Â

Fair enough. It's your opinion that Ed had the spark. As I've said, I found him quite creepy and therefore I didn't see that spark that you speak of.
And I've said it a million times in this thread, but I'll say it one last time - I think D&D are being purposeful in their recast and, essentially, rewrite of the character so that he doesn't have, as you say, "a one track mind" - because Show!Dany doesn't seem to have time for that (with how exasperated she was with him for holding them all up). Michiel's subtlety works well here, and maybe that's why they cast him. But we'll never quite know until D&D outright say it, so this is just me speculating for now and I could be completely wrong.
I think what it all boils down to, and it seems that we're arguing in circles about, is whom you find Dany falling for more believable, Old!Daario or New!Daario. And we all have differing opinions on that. But I'm glad that many of you are giving Michiel a chance beyond this first episode - whether you end up liking him or not.
1308	SeventySeven	2014-04-08	Noooooo, you lot you got it wrong. I think the new Daario will work a lot better long term, as book!Daario is way too annoying for people not to get peeved at Dany being all head over heels about him.Â 
Â 
As for Skreim, I thought he was the worstÂ
1309	Mel_Rose	2014-04-08	Â 
But this new guy seems like the type of guy who would be friendzoned. Picking flowers for her, playing silly sword games to win her affection, etc. Old Daario was straightforward; "You. Me. Shag. Now." *Hair flip*


Â 
I am another one disappointed by the change. Last Daario for me was spot-on: had the swagger and the bad boy vibe and you could see that even from the first moment when he was standing there with a smirk in Dany's tent. New Daario seems like the guy you bring home to your parents.
Â 
I wish they had changed him with another actor that looked a little like old Daario, long hair, something,Â  just to ensure some continuity. This guy is cute but not distinctive enough in a show full of bearded men - not to mention the unsullied are probably lost on who he is.
1310	LordStoneheart	2014-04-08	only bitter idiots think such a sexist thing as as "friendzone" exists, so stop thinking Daario giving her flowers is some poor sap thing. It's based on something from the books, the only difference is that Dany is showing obvious reserve from him.It's definitely an opinion thing because I have no idea where you guys are getting this "badass, arrogant, douchey, confidant" interpretation of last season's Daario. He sounded like there was teleprompter behind him. there was no good delivery. He was completely wooden. Maybe because he had a scene where he talked about whores you guys think he was spot on? Mero was more like Daario than Ed was.New guy on the other hand actually has given some sort of romantic connection to Dany with the flowers. Time will tell, but so far the writing of S4 Daario, while more subtle, is better and its acted well. Last season was sloppy writing and barren acting.

1311	Sand11751	2014-04-08	So glad I found this thread! I thought I was the only one who sees there is ZERO chemistry between new Daario and Dany. Old Daario had all the swagger and you could see why she would have him as a lover; this one and his flowers doesn't fit the character at all.
1312	Jslay427	2014-04-08	If I hadn't read the books I wouldn't have much of a preference. But S3 Daario is closer to what I imagined from the books.
1313	LordStoneheart	2014-04-08	Where are people getting this "the old guy had mad #swags bro!" from? I've just rewatched all the S3 Daario scenes and they're nothing that could be called "swagger" at all.Â
1314	Don Roberto	2014-04-08	Does anyone know why they dropped the old Daario? Contract issues?We all know the real reason. The cryout due to Robb's death was gigantic, especially from the female fanbase. They needed a new Robb for girls to drool over, and the only character this coming season who could pull that off (and isn't likely to die in the foreseeable future) was Daario. New Daario even looks like Richard Madden, somewhat.
1315	Red Tiger	2014-04-08	Agreed, yeah old Daario was a sleazeball but at least he had a certain slick charisma.

Â 
He just doesn't stand out. The last one was at least memorable. Both the way he spoke and how he looked popped out and - even if I wasn't a giant fan of him (nor am I of book Daario) he at least made an impression. This new guy seems like random kind soldier #41 in your standard army.
Â 
Those are just my first impressions of him. There's still time for him to do something to make him stand out and what-not, but old Daario came in with a bang, so first appearances do matter. They've made plenty of changes to characters from book to TV series, some good - some not so much, so I guess it's all about personal preference.
1317	Cyril	2014-04-08	Whatever they did with Daario, regardless of the quality of the actor, didn't work in the first episode.
Â 
I watch the show with a few Unsullied and, even though I told them Daario had been recast and even though his name was repeated over and over that first scene, the performance, writing, and actor were so different that they still asked me "So, who is that?" and "Where's that creepy dude Daenerys was all over last season?"
Â 
I agree with the sentiment earlier in the thread that appearance-wise he's terrible as well.Â  He's better suited to be a northerner than a Tyroshi.Â  He's a bit like I imaged Brandon to look like.
1318	Er Rn	2014-04-08	I agree with a lot of the earlier posts. 
I don't have any complaints with the re-casting wrt acting ability. I think the fault lies more with the wardrobe and hair/makeup. Old Daario at least had a look that was different and memorable. The new Daario looks like Random Northern Soldier #26.

Yeah, he kind of looks like an older Jon Snow but nowhere near as beautiful as Kit Harrington. I'm reserving judgment on his characterization of Daario, but I really wish they would have done some a bit more creative with his wardrobe and styling to make him stand-out and be easier to remember. He is going to be Dany's paramour - so he should be remarkable. Her with some boring dude just doesn't fit.
1320	Nictarion	2014-04-08	Not impressed with either but at least its a character nobody likes anyway.Â Speak for yourself.

If the vast majority of people are seeing something you aren't, its plausible that the problem lies on your end. What you found wooden, stilted, and not unlike a teleprompter, I found absolutely electrifying. Now bear in mind, I don't think Skrein is a neccessarily a "good" actor in the traditional sense of the word, but he nailed the part with more than just his looks. Daario is a simple minded character with a one track mind, and thus Skrein's inability to convey a complex emotional register is actually a surprising asset that makes his performance feel incredibly natural, despite its lack of nuance (Daario himself doesn't have any nuance so it works). Definitely seems that the majority are in agreement, whatever one thinks of Skrein's acting abilities, that he had a booming stage precense. Huisman feels really drab by comparison, and whether this is simply a result of how bland he looks or the way they've written the material for him this season, I don't think its surprising that people feel Skrein did a better job capturing the persona of Daario.

1325	perfectdark	2014-04-08	Daario v1.0 was the type of guy who could steal your gf. It's understandable why he got some hate. Â He had plenty of spunk and you could easily see sexual tension rising between him and daenerys. He has the same charisma that made Arnold famous, he doesn't need acting skills as he sells you the part with his body language. He portrayed the pleasure seeking egomaniac/ unpredictable psychopath to perfection. It is no wonder he got snapped for big action movie role ( there is no way he would turn that down for got).
Â 
Daario v2.0 is almost the opposite. He delivered his line with a mumble, I needed subtitles to comprehend him. His posture was almost hunched and he didn't display any signs of self-confidence. He had weak eye contact and chemistry with Emilia, whereas Ed had that soul piercing stare. The new Daario is too delicate and acts more like a henchmen than a feared killer. The script was poor and didn't fit the character at all. I am completely underwhelmed by the actor's performance but also believe it's a huge miscast, no matter how skilled he might be it will be an extremely hard sell. Â 
Â 
This completely ruins the build up to the Targaryan story for me.

Funny thing is that I'm only seeing this majority in the fandom versus the majority of critics. The majority of external media reviews I've read have given the thumbs up to New!Daario, probably because they found Old!Daario to be skeezy as hell. But again, this is where you and I (and they) differ: you liked the character that way, I didn't. I can see Dany falling for this Daario much more easily than the other, but again it's different strokes for different folks.
Â 
So please don't tell us that "the problem lies on [our] end". We have our opinions, you have yours. Yours are no more valid than ours, and vice versa. We can say that you're crazy for liking the Old!Daario just as you can say that we're crazy for liking the New!Daario, but the fact remains that whether you think it's a massively bad re-cast or not, he's here to stay for two seasons at least, so you might as well give him a little more than a scene or two to grow on you - even if you still end up hating him. Complaining about it is not going to get you a EvenNewer!Daario.
Â 
And one last time, since people don't seem to be getting this: it appears that D&D are trying to change the character itself. From the casting to the clothing to the dialogue, it's PURPOSEFULLY different. They could have slapped a blond wig on this new guy, asked him to shave and get a new set of teeth, but they didn't. They also didn't write him like last season within his first two scenes.Â Â You might not like this more subdued Daario, I might not even like this more subdued Daario (because Michiel can play the hell out of an arrogant SOB) but if that's the way they're going with it, that's the way they're going with it, unfortunately for continuity's sake.

Great post. I couldn't agree more.
1329	Le Cygne	2014-04-08	I like Daario, books and show.  There's more to the story on a closer read. 
At first  I resisted the recasting, but then was fine with it.  I think he'll win people over.
1330	Arak-iri	2014-04-08	I don't understand all the hate Ed Skrein had to deal with. He totally nailed the dangerous/seductive/cocky aspect of his character.
The new actor on the other hand only seems like a good looking tool. I love Dany and she's all kindsof badass, but int he books, daario was having the uppper hand int their relationship. So far, the new daario seems to be chasing dany, not the other way.

They also didn't write him like last season within his first two scenes.Â Â You might not like this more subdued Daario, I might not even like this more subdued Daario (because Michiel can play the hell out of an arrogant SOB) but if that's the way they're going with it, that's the way they're going with it, unfortunately for continuity's sake.


I don't think you're crazy for liking the recast, even though we strongly disagree. My response was more in regards to the other poster, who chided the majority of us for praising Skrein's air of confidence and bravado, as though we're all seeing something that isn't there (and if you'll notice, my criticisms of Huisman have nothing to do with his abilities as an actor). I haven't read all the critical reviews, but something I find striking is that you believe this sense of "skeeviness" Skrein brought to the role is somehow a detriment. The fact of the matter is that Daario is skeevy. Daario is a soulless murderer who kills for pleasure as much as he kills for gold. Sure, it doesn't make him likeable, but that's not how he's written in the books either. There's been points made here about his body language, however, that are definitely of interest regarding this divide between NewDaario and OldDaario (which does, on some level, come down to taste). With Huisman, I'm just not buying the swashbuckling arrogance that subtley trying to sell. This has as much to do with the content on Sunday night as it does his actual body language. He's not holding himself with this booming air of confidence that seemed to just to ooze out of Skrein naturally. Like I said, we'll see what happens though. Whether it's the writing, as you're suggesting, or his delivery or both, I am currently underwhelmed with Daario. Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised. Still too early to call the jury back for a final verdict.

Â 
I do like that you're giving him a chance, versus writing him off like many fans are. I hope he'll pleasantly surprise you (and that D&D will pleasantly surprise us and give him better scenes than the first episode).Â 
Â 
I think the "skeeviness" was a detriment only because he's the love interest of one of the leading ladies on the show. From what I've read on this board, many people were banging their heads against a table trying to read Dany's chapters when she was romancing Daario because they didn't understand how she could fall for him because of this particularly (un-)charming trait. I'll give you that many people like their leading ladies falling for a "bad boy", but usually only when there's also a redemption arc for that "bad boy" put in place. Plus these "bad boys" are never particularly skeevy, they're usually just brooding and taciturn. I just think D&D figured that they needed someone less "skeevy" and more likeable if we're going to have to put up with him for two seasons, whether this particular decision is justified or not.

Now that I can agree with. They're definitely trying hard with this guy, (you can already to tell), to make him more empathetic and likeable. I actually found it somewhat ironic that I liked Skrein's performance so much, considering the fact that I was one of those people banging my head against aDwD because of how awful the Dany/Daario romance is. Seeing as he is the love interest for the leading lady, and she has been written as near immaculate in the tv series, it would be a bit hard for the show watchers to connect with her falling in love with a soulless douchebag. (This is one of the weaker aspects of the adaptation in my opinion, especially when I think about how certain other characters who need not be named havebeen vilified) That being said, I really hope he's able to bring some of that electricity Skrein managed to bring to the screen. There's certainly more captivating scenes on the way, so he has a chance to pull it off, even if he didn't make a very good first impression with me.

I'm definitely looking forward to more captivating scenes because as much as I appreciate Michiel's subtlety and can get behind a less skeezy Daario, I would much rather him have a chance to run the whole gamut of what it might mean to play Daario, from arrogance and charisma to kicking ass and taking names in addition to this increased likeability.

Â 
And I still don't see it. He has three major scenes, and the only air of confidence I see is that he smiles a lot. Otherwise, he's really not doing much of anything. I just seems like he's repeating his lines. Perhaps, yes, in comparison to this new guy's rather chill acting Ed looks like a foppish braggard in comparison, but hardly "swagger."Â
1339	Le Cygne	2014-04-08	I love Dany and she's all kindsof badass, but int he books, daario was having the uppper hand int their relationship. So far, the new daario seems to be chasing dany, not the other way.

He made a play for her from the start in the books.  He was more over the top.  She was responding, but much of that was coming from inside, her thoughts, I think Emilia is conveying that.   I guess they decided between last season and this season not to have him say things like this, but he can get the point across other ways.  Seems like they want the audience to like him, I suppose that means there's a reason.

I do like that you're giving him a chance, versus writing him off like many fans are. I hope he'll pleasantly surprise you (and that D&D will pleasantly surprise us and give him better scenes than the first episode).Â 


I don't understand this "give him a chance" thing people keep yapping about...the deed is done. Â By choice or by necessity, D&D recast Daario. Â They chose Huisman as S4 Daario, they wrote all the scripts, made all the costumes, and have already filmed everything. Â Unless there's a surprise recasting of another Daario for Episodes 2-10, we're going to keep seeing Huisman. Â Unless the wardrobe department made his Epsiode 1 look (costume, hair, etc.) a one-off and he's going to look like, we know what we will be seeing in episodes 2-9. Â All we don't know is how well the dialog will be written and how well he will handle it (although, to be fair, we have no reason to assume it will be better or worse than what we saw the other night).
Â 
So, when I say S3 Daario looked the part (both actor and wardrobe) and had better chemistry than what we've seen of S4 Daario, we have no reason to expect that will change for the rest of this season. Â The only thing that might happen is that the writing gets better (I thought both the Grey Worm and Flower scenes were awkwardly written) or that Huisman might make it *sound* better, but neither of those things can overcome the "look and feel" deficiency that won't be changing.

1343	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-08	ITT: People whinge about a casting we barely got 3 minutes of screen time of.
Â 
*squints* Seriously guys, mountains out of molehills. The majority of viewers watching season 3 thought "Who is this fucking joker and why does he look so derpy?" My mum even commented when New!Daario came on screen that he was better looking immediately. People need to be a bit sympathetic to Dany's choice in a new manfriend. Old!Daario was an improvement on the Book!Daario. But New!Daario is a definite improvement on Old!Daario. He'll look good with no clothes on. He sounds like a cocky putz instead of Mr. Wooden. New!Daario snarking at Grey Worm over Missandei is exactly something Book!Daario would do. The tone and everything. This guy is ultimately a better actor and still smarmy as all hell. So while the audience will be sympathetic to Dany wanting to slam that, the audience will also be convinced that hes kind of a douchecanoe.Â 
Â 
Its also too soon to say if hes really worse, but my first impressions of the new guy is that hes better.Â 
Â 
He made a play for her from the start in the books. He was more over the top. She was responding, but much of that was coming from inside, her thoughts, I think Emilia is conveying that. I guess they decided between last season and this season not to have him say things like this, but he can get the point across other ways. Seems like they want the audience to like him, I suppose that means there's a reason.

I give her props forÂ trying but Clarke is ass at conveying subtlety. (its why shes better suited for the hammy action moments.) So really, it does look like Dany is just staring stupidly after him during the end of the flower scene. The season 3 part where she steps out of the tub was kinda awesome, but theres no subtlety there. Perhaps another scene will happen where Dany actually discusses her thoughts with Missandei on the matter.

Giving him a chance means not writing him off as you do in the sentence above. As for not knowing whether he will handle better dialogue better or worse, as you say, I have good cause to assume he will handle it well having seen him in other projects.
But you seem determined to dislike him, so what can I say? Your circular logic of disliking him and complaining about it and then saying there's nothing that can be done just doesn't particularly make sense to me. Oh, and he's definitely in for S5, as they've signed him already so too bad so sad for those who don't like him or the way D&D have decided to go with the character.

You have a serious problem with temporal matters...I am not determined to dislike [the new Daario], I already do. Â And it's not [just] Huisman the actor, it's the show's casting and wardrobe people, as well as the screenplay writers. Â I assume Huisman had little to no control over those factors, he just auditioned for the part and acted as directed. Â It's not his fault he doesn't look or feel the part, that was somebody else's call to make. Â And to be honest, the showrunners were screwed by Martin, because he's the one who made such a bad character in the first place.

I love ASOIAF, but I can't stand stand Book Daario, and I live just fine. Â I'm not making my statements in order to influence the show's direction, I'm just giving the people who made the decision three thumbs down.

I have a serious problem? I'm attacking you? When I said you were determined to dislike, excuse me, that you dislike the New!Daario? That's not an attack. That's just a fact. I haven't called you names, I haven't insulted you. I said that your circular logic doesn't make sense to me. Maybe it makes sense to you, but not me. That's not an attack.
Â 
I don't care if you personally care for this Daario or not. My statement about giving him another chance is a blanket statement for fans who were willing to write him off after two scenes because I like the dude as an actor and know he is quite good and hope other fans are open to this as well. If you're not one of those people, that's fine. I never said it wasn't. My replies to you have been refuting your statements about "not getting the point" or whatever else you wanted to criticize in whatever post I made. I get your point. You don't like him. I got it, thanks.
Â 
This is versus you telling me that I have a "serious problem with temporal matters", even though it's a matter of semantics and your prose not being clear, or some point I keep on "yapping" about. Let's be real here. I don't take this as attacking me, because well, it's called having an argument or disagreement on the internet and a difference of opinion, but if anyone's attacking anyone, we all know who it is.
Â 
And with that, I'm taking a page out of Lord Stoneheart's book and if you want to talk/argue semantics/whatever further, let's take it off this board. As you said, it's a forum for discussing the show.

Â 
What really jarred me was that New Daario was like a shy little boy on a grade school playground. He was diffident, cute, humble. Nothing like book Daario to say the least. I wasn't terribly thrilled with S3 Daario. Daario in my mind had more of the lean, hungry drifter look ... only with blue hair and bling. S3 Daario looks more like a Poor Man's Version of Fabio. I think Huisman is better looking, but there are already a dozen brown-haired actors with beards and he blends in too much.
Â 
Still not sure why the costuming department didn't at least give him blue-tinted beard (maybe not electric blue, but a blu-ish shade to the beard or at least the tips).

From the casting to the clothing to the dialogue, it's PURPOSEFULLY different. They could have slapped a blond wig on this new guy, asked him to shave and get a new set of teeth, but they didn't. They also didn't write him like last season within his first two scenes.Â Â You might not like this more subdued Daario, I might not even like this more subdued Daario (because Michiel can play the hell out of an arrogant SOB) but if that's the way they're going with it, that's the way they're going with it, unfortunately for continuity's sake.

Â 
Â 
Source? Or is this just pure speculation on your part?
I doubt they were going a different route. The scene, albeit horribly written, still portrays Daario as a living-on-the-edge charmer. If they were going for subtle, dark and sarcastic ( which describes 99% of the male characters on got) then the new actor still failed on his delivery. I have no idea how anyone could be pleased with his scene. It was weak and rather timid. I hope he improves but he will forever remain inadequate for this role.
1360	changalang	2014-04-08	What's the point of even doing a fantasy show if you're afraid to depict cultures the audience may find too outlandish?


Â 
I agree with this in some regards, but as with the likeability factor, we also have to remember that they're trying to appeal to the masses. And to take Dany's love interest seriously, I think some people would be put off if he were too outlandish unfortunately.

Â 
Total speculation - just based on them not even trying to make him look/sound anything like Old!Daario. I don't think they were going for dark and sarcastic - I think they were going for likeability and lightness and just a bit of charm (especially in lieu of the following scene with the human signs). Flower-giving and all that. I think if they were going for that, I think it played well, but if they weren't, who knows what they were trying to do then. Let us hope that they figure out what they want to do with his character because I think it's confusing for a lot of people, myself included (though, as I said, I like the actor, so I'm a bit biased lol). I just feel like they're trying to completely re-write him from the first two scenes. We'll see if I'm right or wrong as more episodes are released.

To be honest though, they could have done this and I would have still taken him seriously. The gold teeth may have been too much however. Lol.

I was picturing something like that, maybe just a tad less bold (color).
Â 
Yes, the gold teeth would probably have most casual viewers running out of the room screaming in fear and the rest making bad pirate jokes. I'm Daaaarrrrrrio. Yar.

Maybe they'll run into a field of whatever kind of plant that produces blue dye and Jorah will suggest: "Daario Narharis, blue is the colour of the Khaleesi.

Take any scene of Daario from S3 and compare to the two scenes with the new guy and Ed's portrayal of Daario was confident fleshed out. The new guy, not so much.Â A lot of this my be the writing, it's almost seems like D & D are introducing Dario for the first time this season.The showdown in front of the walls of Meereen will go along way to selling cockiness of the new Daario character. I'm hoping for the best, because he's who we have now and he'll still be better than season 3 Gregor Clegane.

Honestly, in the books, I could skim over Dany acting ridiculous around sleazy Daario (I tolerated him more on a reread...I blame the Amoka portrait). In the show, I'd be "RAAWWWWRGH!" if I had to sit through a dozen "omg was Daario in court today? Do I look pretty?" scenes. So, honestly, if they portray Daario as more rakish/fire-but-little-stability than greaseball/athletic RenFair tweaker, I'd be down for it. Â

1367	Nictarion	2014-04-08	HAR. Right? Shes legit bad. At this point, i actually feel sorry for her more than resent her. Cuz shes reallyÂ trying. Like i see her trying so hard~Â She doesn't need anyone to feel bad for her. She's pretty much the star (along with Dinklage) of one of the biggest shows on tv, has been nominated for an Emmy, and is being offered the lead in big budget movies. She's doing just fine.
1368	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-08	I find it funny that this Daario is not "Daario" enough for book readers, when he is easily one of the most despised characters in the series amongst them, and is often attributed to Dany's frustrating ADWD storyline.
Â 
I came to like Daario on rereads. His physical appearance is what really throws me, but I think he empowers Dany. Ed Skrein never sold me on him; apart from his patronising smile you wanted to smack off his face (which I actually could imagine Daario having), I don't think he showed much charisma or the so-called "swagger" that people are now saying he had.
Â 
It's been one episode, re-introducing the character through two light-hearted scenes. I still think the episode where he champions for Dany outside Meereen will be the one to turn the tables.

Thanks for being the Lowest Common Demoninator, bucko. Her big budget role is an action film which she is suited for. (cuz she flat out sucks at doing anything other than doing that one expression and barking out dialogue) She got nominated for the Emmy cuz she was the only one who had enough screen time. Geez.Â The fact that Michelle Fairley didnt get that nomination was absolute robbery. Dinklage is actuallyÂ goodÂ despite his wonky accent.

1371	Avnar	2014-04-09	This show is brilliant...however -This new Daario is just lazy from all involved. How hard would it have been to give the guy a shave and a wig? Atleast TRY!
Â 
My wife actually turned to me and said "Who's that?" when he was on screen and she liked the character from season 3!
Â 
I'm just going to pretend Daario has the same ability as Jaquen (sp?)
1372	Le Cygne	2014-04-09	Daario isn't clean shaven in the books, either. If they shave his beard, that's it, no more. I had to get used to two of him and that would be too much. And bring back Jaime's beard, please (think I might have said that before).Oh, and Emilia is fine.
1373	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-09	I think Skrein pulled off the Daario character pretty well, but this new guy doesn't seem bad either.
Â 
The Aragorn comparison is stupid. The "I'd rather have no brains than no balls." line showed that he's still a smartass. The flowers thing was just proof that he knows how to talk to chicks. He's a womanizer, not some fucking Romeo-type romantic hero.

1374	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-09	Skrein captured Daario Nefaris' douchiness and cockiness perfectly.Â 
Huisman is just your everyday soldier. He seems like a nice guy. Not the douchy daario, dany likes in the books.Â
1375	Nictarion	2014-04-09	I dont get why everybody is sayng new Daario is a "nice guy", the comment he made to Grey Worm was anything but nice.
1376	-Ghost-	2014-04-09	I dont get why everybody is sayng new Daario is a "nice guy", the comment he made to Grey Worm was anything but nice.

I agree. 
I don't see what Skrein could have done differently with the 2 scenes we've seen so far besides add his douchy smile that everyone loves so much.
1377	CrypticWeirwood	2014-04-09	I could never stand the old Daario actor. Â He looked too much a slimy garage-metal teenager, not a hot guy who could turn Daenerysâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head with his swashbuckling, his wit, and his swagger. Â The new actor is an immeasurably better fit for that rA´le.
1378	NaarioDaharis	2014-04-09	I don't know who decided that Daario was "clownish." He was flamboyant, but this isn't today's world and he doesn't live in Westeros.
Â 
He is only slightly odd by Essos standards.
Â 
He is definitely not so different or a downgrade from Drogo.
Â 
Most girls of today's world would take one look at Drogo IRL and run screaming. Nobody wants to be with a creepy giant guy with dark circles and a dirty braid to his knees.
Â 
But, in the world of Westeros, with Dany who had no one else, he was the bee's knees.
Â 
Daario shows up, has colored beard and hair (is that really so weird in today's world, even?) But I don't think any of his outward appearance would work if his personality wasn't up to snuff. He looks the way he does and acts the way he does because he can. He is the shit and everyone knows it.
Â 
Daario 2.0 (lol) seems to have come from some southern american state and grown a beard that doens't fit his face, and also makes his large ears stand out.
Â 
I'm just accepting that they are reworking the character for their own means. I don't consider him to be an adaptation from the books.
Â 
That's great the actor plays good roles in other shows, but this is a completely different world from "Nashville." Just cause an actor is good at one part doesn't mean he will always be good if the part isn't right for him.Â 
Â 
Dany could use a sexy guy in her party of old men and eunuchs. Now we have another older gentleman with big ears. Sorry, the ears stood out to me.
Â 
Also, he is very white and has a poor english accent. Basically they aren't making him Daario at all.
Â 
Did anyone else think his armor was oddly large and awkward looking as well? Like it didn't fit him?
1379	Tyrion's Third Wife	2014-04-09	I liked old Daario better, this one doesn't scream "confidence" at all. When old Daario grabbed Dany's hand to move it on the map, you could feel her physical reaction. I get NO such chemistry with this one.
Â 
But I'm willing to hold out for better chemistry in future episodes.
1380	The Great Unwashed	2014-04-09	Â 
Because she's attracted to him and not Jorah? In the books she's not attracted to him. The show has beefed up his looks. This is the real Jorah, and Dany just isn't attracted to him the way she is attracted to Daario, Iain Glen or not.Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
I'm sorry, but book Jorah couldn't have been a total scrub since he managed to convince Lynesse Hightower to marry him.
1381	-Ghost-	2014-04-09	I don't know how anyone can say that the part isn't right for him based off maybe 3 minutes of screen time. I kinda doubt they were like "fuck it, I liked you in Treme, you're in!" I imagine that he had some kind of audition. D&D and their team have been outstanding with choosing actors, so I see no reason to doubt them now without seeing more than 10 lines.
1382	The Great Unwashed	2014-04-09	Even though I thought the new Daario was vastly superior to the old Daario, even based on the 3 minutes of screen time he got, I will say that the old Daario was the perfect casting for the book Daario, given that he dialed the douchiness meter up to 10.Â 
Â 
But, given that I hate the book Daario with the white hot rage of 1,000 suns, I vastly prefer the new Daario to the old.

Â 
An audition doesn't take more than a few minutes. You do not need 3 hours of screenplay to see if an actor is a fit or not. First impressions are everything.
Â 
I actually think the old Daario would have done so much better with the flowers scene.Â
1384	Daenerys Must Die	2014-04-09	Where are people getting this "the old guy had mad #swags bro!" from? I've just rewatched all the S3 Daario scenes and they're nothing that could be called "swagger" at all.Â 


Â 
 
Â 
Maybe they were just distracted because he was a hunk?.. Or at least fit the 'pretty boy' role well..
Â 
While I never liked book Daario (intended to be divisively written of course - some trust him, some do not.) I think Michael Huisman has a better chance of turning it into a memorable role in the long run over Ed, who stood out at first, but over time I think would have gotten pretty tiring..

1393	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-09	From book 1 to book 5, I went from someone who liked Dany's story to someone who can't skip past her pages quickly enough on re-reads. She's easily my least favorite character in the novels. Now, blaming Daario for that entirely would be ludicrous, but all he did was exacerbate the complete stupidity that her story had become. Of course this is just my opinion, but I think a fair amount of people feel the same way. One thing the show is probably trying to do is make it so that Dany's inevitably bad arc is slightly less annoying by giving her a love interest that is somewhat likable or relatable to the typical viewer. Of course, they could have made Daario still badass in an Oberyn kind of way, but I think they wanted to leave that to the Red Viper alone and make Daario more of a typical mischievous, romantic type.Â 
Â 
We've also seen one episode. I didn't have amazingly high hopes for Bronn after his first couple of scenes and now I can't picture anything else but Jerome Flynn doing it.Â

That and his eyes. His bright blue eyes...Dany loved the way his gold tooth gleamed when he grinned. She loved the fine hairs on his chest. She loved the strength in his arms, the sound of his laughter... "You are beautiful," she blurted as she watched him don his riding boots and lace them up...

It goes back to what I said earlier though that I find it so fascinating that everyone can watch the exact same thing transpire in front of them and interpret it in completely different ways. Humans are awesome.

Â 
How did you come to such conclusion ? Was it the mumbling or the hunched posture or the timid demeanor ?
I might agree that the old Daario was generic (which worked fine for the role) but how exactly is the new one forming any identity or connection ? I am just so baffled by this. Â

It was the way in which he was able to so easily play with her emotions. She's annoyed at first, but his calm and vigilance gets a very noticeable reaction from her where you can see that for a second she feels like an asshole because he's actually giving her a unique lesson and perspective on the land. But it doesn't take her long to realize that she was right initially in thinking that he's hitting on her when he gives her the third flower, but by then she's almost impressed by it. 
She's a Queen and he played her like a harp. She took the flowers when she could have walked away. Most of the men around her treat her with reverence or treat her like a child or their daughter, and Daario treats her like a girl that he really likes. Her smile in that scene says more than anything the season 3 script said.
1404	WTFSalami	2014-04-09	I'm going to be far more accepting of Dany's Meereen storyline if Newdaario is roguish, charming, and genuinely cares for her as opposed to the frat boy douchebag that gets to bang a queen. 
This is an opportunity for the show to fix a stupid ass plotline that GRRM created. I've seen just about enough of the "good girl chases tattooed bad boy much to the objection of daddy" stories to last a lifetime. 
I find it odd that the majority of book readers dislike Daario and Dany's attraction to him, but also object to the show possibly making it better (Newdaario could very well end up being an even bigger douche than Fabio) by making him more worth her while. It's the whole "misery loves company" cliche. I HAD TO SUFFER THROUGH THIS SHIT PART OF A BOOK THAT MADE ME HATE DAENERYS, SO THEY SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE THROUGH IT TOO! 
Nah dude, I'd rather like Dany than hate her, there are more than enough characters to hate in this series.

*slow clap*
1406	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-09	From book 1 to book 5, I went from someone who liked Dany's story to someone who can't skip past her pages quickly enough on re-reads. She's easily my least favorite character in the novels. Now, blaming Daario for that entirely would be ludicrous, but all he did was exacerbate the complete stupidity that her story had become. Of course this is just my opinion, but I think a fair amount of people feel the same way. One thing the show is probably trying to do is make it so that Dany's inevitably bad arc is slightly less annoying by giving her a love interest that is somewhat likable or relatable to the typical viewer. Of course, they could have made Daario still badass in an Oberyn kind of way, but I think they wanted to leave that to the Red Viper alone and make Daario more of a typical mischievous, romantic type.Â 
Â 
We've also seen one episode. I didn't have amazingly high hopes for Bronn after his first couple of scenes and now I can't picture anything else but Jerome Flynn doing it.Â 


Â 
Exactly. I loved her story in Book 1 but it gets more and more problematic as time goes by - and douchey Daario is a big stumbling block in that. I hate NewDaario less than OldDaario and to me that is a huge step forward already.

1407	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-09	I dont get why everybody is sayng new Daario is a "nice guy", the comment he made to Grey Worm was anything but nice.


No joke. The tone was also hella mean.
Â 


Â 
I'm sorry, but book Jorah couldn't have been a total scrub since he managed to convince Lynesse Hightower to marry him.


Lynesse Hightower was a gold digger. She bolted when he couldnt pay for her lifestyle. She gave less fucks about Jorah and more about his money and what he could provide to stroke her ego. He was head-over-heels for her too. Goes to show how thick the guy really is.
Â 


I thought Ed Skrein was beyond awful. Am I alone here? I also thought he was rather homely, whereas with the new Daario I at least vaguely understand the appeal (though admittedly, neither are my type).
Â 
I feel like Huisman is a major upgrade in terms of acting ability; give it a few episodes before wishing the walking Herbal Essence commercial to come back.Â 


He was not what i would consider hot. Easier to digest than blue haired Jack Sparrow wannabe, sure, but not hot. (Old Daario)Â 
New guy is easier to come to terms with why Dany wants that D.
Â 


Let's face it...the real problem is that GRRM clearly has no clue what women find attractive. A golden tooth? A 3-pronged blue beard with gold tips on his mustache? I mean look at this:Â http://img.4plebs.or...90684446001.jpgÂ (and let's not forget, this is one of the more forgiving pictures that leaves out his "curving nose").
Â 
Casting this guy was always going to be a nightmare.


GRRM knows what the women he writes find attractive. Notice how they all like different types. Dany wants the badasses who tout on about how badass they are. She also likes muscular guys. Sansa goes for the standard dreamy prince types, but her type seems to be changing...
Arya seems to find a lot of things to be handsome, including bold but mysterious types. (like Jaqen) Cat liked her Ned. Asha loves the pretty boys. Arianne likes smarmy manpretty. Etc and so forth.Â

 I never hated Dany for wanting Daario, but i feel this. If Daario can be more fleshed out and a deeper character but still remains the same at the core, im cool with it.
1408	changalang	2014-04-09	Sounds like you just don't want to let this go.

I'm not allowed to react to someone that just admitted that they were trying to insult me? And yet you're allowed to react to someone who wasn't trying to insult you (but you took it that way)? How does that make any sense? Am I in some sort of Bizarro World?

1409	ground_control	2014-04-09	Some of us Book Readers watching the Show would like to see a reasonably faithful adaptation. Â Some of us Book Daario Haters hate the character as written because Martin appears to be describing two different characters (Book Daario -- Physical and Book Daario -- Mental). Â When I read the books, I completely ignore Book Daario -- Physical descriptions and try to imagine something I can believe matches Book Daario -- Mental.
Â 
S3 Daario managed to look physically distinctive without being a clown and had a good enough attitude to make a Daario that (IMO) was better than Book Daario.
Â 
S4 Daario *may* be better than S3 Daario acting-wise (honestly, I know nothing about either actor other than what they've done in GOT), but by nowhere near a large enough margin to overcome the appearance gap. Â And it's not just Huisman's looks -- the wardrobe (including makeup, beard / no-beard, hair color, etc.) department has a lot to do with this. Â If they tell Huisman to grow his beard a certain way, and give him a certain outfit to wear, and that greatly contributes to him looking like a random Westerosi extra, that's not the actor's fault, and I'm not dinging him for that.
Â 
tl;dr The actor (Huisman) is only part of the package, it's the S4 Daario package as a whole that has failed to live up to the S3 Daario package (which beat the pants off of the Book Daario package).

Pro-Tip: You successfully ignore people by not reading what they say or responding to them. Â Publicly stating, "I read what you said to somebody else and am replying to you just to say that I won't keep reading what you say, even though you had no reason to know who I am or that I ever read anything you said" is actually a statement of a failure to ignore somebody.

Daario dresses like a clown because he is a clown. So he's not going to act like a clown dressed like a normal sellsword. You basically just want to criticize the show for not following things you did enjoy while giving them no credit for changing things you didn't enjoy. Plus, even on these extremely diehard forums the general majority seems to hate Daario's attitude and the stupid shit he says, yet now everyone's coming out of the woodwork to say what a travesty it is that we don't have to watch someone act like a douchebag constantly.Â

Â 
To be fair we've also seen only one episode. There's plenty of time for our opinion to develop. He does make fun of Grey Worm for having no balls. But the point is you're not going to get the ridiculous persona of Daario without the ridiculous everything else that comes along with it, so they're toning down Daario overall to make him less comical, which according to popular opinion on here would've seemed to be a good decision.
1420	Heidrun	2014-04-10	What I'm wondering is maybe the writers are trying to set up a Love Triangle with Dany and Jorah and Daario.Â  Jorah hasn't made his move on her yet like he did in the early part of the book. If Daario was a cheesy Poor Man's Fabio and Jorah was Iain Glen  , then viewers would probably be wondering what the heck Dany? If Daario is made sympathetic, then Dany choosing him over Daario makes more sense.

Ironic since you missed my saying "in a sense". That or he just doesn't stand out since he looks like everyone else. If he were set next to a few of the norths soldiers, no one would notice the difference.
At the end of the day I've said that i do hope that he grows on me and that the writing for him gets better. You people just can't accept that some of us aren't a fan of new Daario so far.
It's not hard to understand, some of us just got used to Daario from last season looking and behaving in a certain way. We got it in our heads that book Daario would be represented in spirit because that's what we were given. Some of us just don't like that this guy is more subtle and looks like a regular northman and that his look had been homogenized.
If he does it for you, great, but he'll have to grow on me and others.
1426	perfectdark	2014-04-10	the essence of Daario that was captured last season is entirely lost with the recasting.
I have rewatched the new scenes and still find them cringe worthy and under-acted to the point of dilution. They don't stand out like Ed Skrein's scenes.
I didn't even get any hint of romance from the flower scene the first time around because it sounded like pointless rambling, something I would expect from an english gentleman not Daario! I can't stress how awful and timid the delivery was.Â

I feel this is the reason why most guys hated Ed Skrein's performance lol. We males tend to view anyone with better looks as a threat. Daario 1.00 epitomized the playboy jock but also added an element of danger and mystery. You could tell his romanticism was nothing more than a well honed womanizer's scheme to get into dany's pants but you also get the sense of an admiration for her. They took out his boldness and unpredictability with his replacement who could in no way be described as a jock.

Â 
I can't agree with this. Old Daario had the attitude and bravado of book Daario. What does this Daario have like book Daario besides hair on his face?


A LOT more acting experience, which will probably show better when he has longer than a 30 second scene for you to make a judgement on.

Daario isn't exactly a character that requires nuance. All his acting chops are for naught. And will acting help him look any different? Will it make his stance stronger?

1434	bent branch	2014-04-10	This thread has been led me to do some research into the word swagger. In the traditional definition of the word, swagger could never be displayed subtly. However, looking up the word swagger on Urban Dictionary led me to this definition:
Â 

A demeanor of confidence, coolness, and togetherness. Someone with Swagger gives of an ora of comfortability with his/her self. Swagger is commonly referred to as Swag or Swagga. Swagger is not to be confused with cockiness. Cockiness is someone thinking they are the shit, but if you have swagger you probably are the shit.
"Look at Galton, he walks with such swagger"Â 
"I know, he just gives off such a cool vibe"
"I'm like a robot fueled off of swagger."
byÂ yourbestfriend123Â November 02, 2009
Â 

Â 
Contrast this definition of swagger with the Merriam-Webster definition of swagger:
Â 

Full Definition ofÂ SWAGGER
1
aÂ :Â  an arrogantly self-confident way of walkingÂ :Â  an act or instance ofÂ swaggering
Â 
bÂ :Â  arrogant or conceitedly self-assured behavior
Â 
cÂ :Â Â ostentatiousÂ display or bravado
2
:Â  a self-confident outlookÂ :Â Â cockiness
Â 

Â 
So these two definitions stand in direct contradiction of each other. I am not trying to say one is more correct than the other, but to show that at least some of us may be using this term in pretty much opposite ways. I would also like to point out that the traditional definition of the word swagger says nothing about the individual's ability to follow through on their boastful claims. Also, I am using the term swagger in a traditional sense when I say NewDaario has no swagger. The subtly of performance that some are praising in the NewDaario is proof enough that he has no swagger in the traditional sense.
Â 
Does this mean that the showrunners are trying to do something with Dany's storyline? Does it mean that they are trying to get us to like Daario more? I don't know. I have a sneaky suspicion that it doesn't mean anything more than the showrunners uncomfortable with swagger (in the traditional sense). The characters in the story who display swagger are Renly, Loras, Jaime, Mance, Oberyn, Tormund, and Daario (this is not an exhaustive list, just the ones I can think of off the top of my head). So far the only individuals that they haven't toned down in the series are Jaime and Oberyn. They let Jaime keep his swagger until he lost his hand and they have just introduced Oberyn.
Â 
The reason they may be uncomfortable with swagger in their characters is that swagger is a tricky personality trait to handle. An example of this is someone who is in the books and not yet been introduced in the series is:
Â 

	Spoiler Darkstar. We know that GRRM didn't intend for Darkstar to be the butt of jokes, yet he is. This is the danger of having characters with swagger. They can sometimes come across as just silly. (I put this in spoiler, because the title of this thread doesn't indicate spoilers).

I fully support the show possibly giving him more depth and personality in an attempt to fix Martin's horrible writing. I would like it so much more if Daario was a likable rogue instead of the insufferable douchebag fucking asshole that most of you hated before but somehow seem to want to see on screen.Â

I agree....If they had made him that way last season to begin with. A more likeable Daario would easily make the whole Danny arc a lot more tolerable. 
But as with everyone saying to give him more time to see if he grows on us, let's give him more time before we say his lack of charisma is "subtle and good"
1438	Blazfemur	2014-04-10	I'd say the "Breaker Of Chains" episode would give him an opportunity to impress. That will be a good determination as to what he can do.

1442	perfectdark	2014-04-10	Yeah, that real sense of depth and humanity that Ed Transporter brought to the table is completely lost with this new guy. I was so devotional and drawn in by Guy Fabio that I forgot I was watching a fantasy TV series, and was instead transported (LAWLZ) into a world of wonder and mysticism the likes of which our feeble world has not yet known.Â

I will give Huisman's interpretation of your everyday henchman until next episode. I am hoping by then he would have undergone plastic surgery, replaced his vocal chords and grown a set of balls. I am sure he made an excellent drug addict on his past show, I would have no problem buying into that. However, a charmer and a lady's man, he is definitely not.Â

That's funny, because that is exactly what they brought him in for (twice! - to romance two of their leading ladies) on Nashville and I found him quite charming on that. But again, different strokes for different folks!

1444	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-10	In response to people saying "if you hate BookDaario so much, why do you want to see that Daario portrayed in the show?". Well, sometimes it's just really good to have characters you love to hate. Would the tv series be as great as it is if Joffrey wasn't as loathed in the show as he is in the books. When we were reading the books we despised Joffrey. When Jack Gleeson brought him to life so wonderfully, we hated him even more! Because it's fun and creates a good balance between characters you are rooting for and characters you hope will burn in seven hells.
Â 
I do get and understand the reasoning (if they are in fact doing this) for D&D changing Daario to make him a more believable love interest so Dany's Meereen vacation doesn't seem so ridiculous. But for me, it just makes it even more boring. I want someone in that storyline I can actively root for or against, and I want that against to be Daario.
1445	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-10	I never got the sense that most people "love to hate" Daario, though. They just outright hate his character; hence why a lot of the complaining about Dany's ADwD arc is also attributed to him.
1446	Blazfemur	2014-04-10	im gonna love it when daario actually dies and i stop getting notifications that this thread was updated
1447	Le Cygne	2014-04-10	Daario is in the main cast next season. There will be much more Daario next season.
1448	barmyscouser	2014-04-11	I enjoyed reading GRRM's version of Dany & Daario in the S & M way that I enjoy picking at scabs. Â I'm just going to assume that we've all had the experience in real life of watching good women fall for ass-clowns.
Â 
S3 Daario made me think that D & D intended to give us that same experience in high definition. Â S4 Daario makes me think they now intend something different. Â So let it be different.

Am I the only one on this board who laughed out loud at the flower scene?
1449	Le Cygne	2014-04-11	Seeing the hot chick fall for the one she wants, not the one you want her to fall for, must be tough.She thinks he's beautiful, so they made him beautiful on the show. It's not different, it's the same.

Shut up and go watch Aragorn/Arwen's scenes in LOTR if you want a likeable rogue type character falling in love with a perfect she-elf.
Â 
Daario is supposed to be a bit of a jerk. Dany is supposed to be flawed and at times stupid. It's not bad writing just because you can't accept characters that aren't likeable.

1460	NaarioDaharis	2014-04-11	I don't know what kind of women you are, but I know lots of women who would find Daario very attractive.
Â 
He's not mainstream in today's world, doesn't have short, gelled hair and a clean-shaven face (why do you think they made Pod, Gendry, even Robb for a time like this when its not their book description? Its because that's what most women today find attractive).
Â 
Obviously, you've never been in a Hot Topic if you think dyed hair is unbelievable. Some people enjoy dying their hair, piercing themselves, tattoos, etc.
Â 
Dany isn't a mainstream character (her first love was Drogo). She likes interesting men. Not Podrick and Gendry.Â 
Â 
I'm hoping that new Daario's interaction with Grey Worm was supposed to be an insight to his true personality, while he was putting up a front for Dany, and we will see his darker side later on.
Â 
I don't like the look at all, he looks so boring and kinda stupid in those massive sleeves and pauldrons, but I'm going to give their adaptation a chance.
Â 
Obviously he's a popular character or we wouldn't give a crap, so the argument of "everyone hates him so who cares" is invalid.

Â 

This doesn't make any sense. I'm going to tackle the last point first. We give a crap because we're FORCED to. Danys whole arc involves him. It's not that he's popular, it's that Dany is a major character and Daario is forced on us. 
Being talked about =/= being popular. And as far as "mainstream" what does that even mean? Anything that's not clean shaven is mainstream? She's a savior type hot chick character who clearly falls in line with the thinking of the time. How much more "mainstream" can you get? Khal Drogo wasn't mainstream because he was what, not part of the Westoros civilised culture? You can't make the link that she likes interesting men from that because ANY man can be interesting. Moreover, Daario and the Khal are world's apart on almost everything.
And as a person who frequented Hot Topic as a teenager, dyed hair isn't unbelievable. What's unbelievable is a character like Dany falling for a guy with not just dyed hair, but died facial hair, and a golden tooth. It's like having a Hot Topic dyed hair, pieced up guy wooing a princess. It's just a head scratcher.

Â 
Apparently, she finds these things attractive. She loved a guy with bells in his hair. No reason not to like a guy with earrings and dyed hair.Â 
Â 
She has no other attractive men who have been so blatant with their lust. He is the closest she might get. He and Drogo are both strong-willed, charismatic murderers.
Â 
If people find Jack Sparrow attractive then Daario Naharis is not a far stretch.Â

For the character, it is. And Khal Drogo had bells in his hair, but he was also strong, a leader of men. Daario is a clown.Just because GRRM says she's attracted to him doesn't mean we have to like or understand it. For a character like Dany, it's simply baffling to much of us.

You seem to be forgetting something - Dany isn't from Earth. She's from Essos, and will therefore be pretty familiar with Tyroshi fashion (bright clothes, dyed hair, etc). You really can't compare the fashion sense of a fantasy culture to modern Earth standards and say Daario is like a Hot Topic teenager.
Â 
If we're going to talk about Earth fashion though, it wasn't all that long ago that powdered wigs and tights were considered extremely attractive on men. That may not seem so strange to you because we've all been exposed to historical imagery... but if we hadn't and you saw a man in a powdered wig and tights for the very first time walking down a high street, you would think that he looks like a complete clown and wouldn't be able to comprehend how such a look could ever be considered fashionable or attractive.

No but i can compare it to the fashion from the book, and comparatively, it's still ridiculous. And you and I have a different way of interpreting "not that long ago".
1466	Blazfemur	2014-04-11	Leave Daario alone. He's a dual-wielding level 12 swashbuckler with immense backstab damage, and he's chaotic neutral. He's ok in my book.
1467	WakeTheDragon	2014-04-12	It's not completely the actors fault they did such a bad job with his look but he has a long way to go to capture the attitude and body language of daario the way Skrein did. It was one episode I'm willing to give him a chance but man what a bad start.
1468	Skore	2014-04-13	Daario 1.0 WAS better, but that is not saying much.
Â 
Come on, they have eunuchs, hounds, dragons, scarred cannibals and yet a flamboyant sellsword is too much? Will Aegon have died brown hair???????
Â 
Daario IS an important character. Important enough to be ranked as one of Daenarys' 3 hostages to the Yunkish and he represents her own Draconic nature in the choice she makes to unravel the Mereenese knot.
Â 
They should have gone full on bad boy Daario from the start but the guy they originally had at least had the right air of swagger compared to the new guy.
1469	binga	2014-04-13	The old Daario was a Yale hipster while the new Daario is an MIT nerd. Neither one is like the Daario of the books but the first Daario is closer to the personality while Daario 2 is close to the look.
1470	BlueDragon	2014-04-13	Well, in a few hours we may get some resolution concerning this mysterious miss in my opinion.
Â 
Daario 2.0 seemed right to me. Â There was chemistry there.
Â 
Daario 3.0 is off in so many ways. Â Huisman is capable of giving off that bad boy I'm in it for sex vibe, but producers, directors, costumers, hair and makeup and scriptwriters just got it all wrong last week.
Â 
Nothing about him made sense to me.
Â 
I can buy 2.0 didn't reach some people. Â I thought he was hitting the right notes frankly. Â 
Â 
3.0 was milktoast except when he was going after Grey Worm which made no sense. Â Daario doesn't really care about evaluating other men or competing with them. Â Daario assumes women want him, period.
Â 
I would have to blame the director most. Â The director should have said: wait, wait, wait. Â this isn't working. Â 
Â 
I am wondering how many here understand what gets to women, especially a woman like Dany.
Â 
And yes, the costume could not have been worse.
Â 
Somebodies, plural dropped the ball.
Â 
It wasn'tÂ Huisman. Â He can deliver.

I am wondering how many here understand what gets to women, especially a woman like Dany.


Â 
As in what do women like?
Â 
I've always kinda gone for the "bad boy" type: long hair, tattoos, black leather, guitar player. It's kinda the thrill like riding a motorcycle or a fast horse, like slumming in a bad part of town or skydiving. My first husband had the long hair, played bass (served as a one time replacement for the bass player in Rush during a gig at Sault Ste. Marie, ON), had a prison record ... Again, kinda the bad boy appeal. He was one of those men who liked to take charge and was very arrogant and when I was young, there was a certain appeal to that. Although thanks to his bad boy background, he died rather young.
Â 
Now I'm with a guy who is basically a non-animated version of Ned Flanders: clean cut, wears polo shirts, very laid back to the the point where I have a hard time getting him to answer simple questions. "What do you want for dinner?" "Whatever you feel like making."Â  ??Â  I have to spell out things for him which can get irritating at times. His nephew is the same way. He helps me with some farm work.
Â 
Me: I've got to stop at the gas station and get gas. Do you want something to drink while we're here?
Nephew: I don't care
Me: I'm going to buy gas and go in and pay. While I'm in there, I'm going to buy a cherry Coke. If you want something to drink, I will pay for it.
Â 
If my DBF does show some assertiveness, "Honey, I'm making nachos for dinner" it's actually a little refreshing. Not that I want a man bossing me around, but a man who doesn't always go along with whatever I say or do is less irritating than one who does.
Â 
I've only read 2 of the books in whole (GoT and ASOS and currently reading ADWD) so I haven't seen all the nuances of Dany's arc. Maybe having an arrogant man who isn't catering to her is a little refreshing for her. Again, she was used to a strong, assertive ambitious man in Drogo. So maybe Daario reminds her of those aspects of Drogo.
1472	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-13	Ummm... Why don't you read the books in order?
1473	Heidrun	2014-04-13	I read GoT back in 2009 on an airplane. Ended up giving the book away after I heard the series wasn't finished. Money's been tight as we've been having vehicle problems so I went to the library to check them out. I live in a rural area and our library doesn't have many books and the only one of ASOIAF that they have is ASOS. So I read that. Then I saw ADWD for sale at the pharmacy, so I bought that. Yes, I should go on Amazon and find cheap copies of the others, but my "bill-paying money" is in the bank account as most of my earnings are cash so my "me money" tends to be cash in hand. I know this is convoluted logic, but considering the number of weird theories on this forum, I don't think this is the place to criticize someone else's logic.Â Â

Â 
I am under the impression, that the makers of "transporter" do not want him on this show, if they make him the new "transporter" for 3 big movies to come. All other comparison of the two actors are personal preferences. They both have merits. They are very different. The whole thing is not good for GoT.

August 2013 - Announced that Skrein was being replaced as Daario

It is possible they are connected, but I think it is unlikely.
1480	Wussel	2014-04-27	Announcments are made before the shootings. Negotiations are a different matter. I am sure they believe in his acting skills. Would you bet millions on Skrein if he is still asociated with the Daario role? Would it be possible that Drogo had bad influence on Conan? Maybe Skrein just overdid the money thing at GoT because he felt allready unreplaceable?
Â 
The story of bad acting is just not convincing for me.
1481	Heidrun	2014-04-29	I would have thought that Momoa's role as Ronon in Stargate: Atlantis would have been a stronger influence (esp. since McKay jokingly called Ronon "Conan" in one episode).
Â 
Momoa's supposed to be in some new police/mystery-ish series. I've seen the trailers but the show itself doesn't look interesting
1482	ginaflynn	2014-04-07	I've been thinking this for a year now, but I have not seen any threads on this topic at all.Â What Jamie said to Brianne about being related cofirmed my suspiciouns.Â  D&D are privy to all the answers from George,and Knows who's who and all the plot twists. First I'm thinking how could little baby Tyrion as a dwarf rip Joanna, his mother, while being born,after her having twins. It didnt make sense. Also Brianne said to Lady Catlyn she never knew her mother ,now these twoÂ remarks being said lets me know these are clues. Brianne looks like a targ , she resembles Duncan the tall, He was mentioned in the white book. also we have Tyrion,Â Duncan the small from the book series. Â When Brianne and Tyrion was born it was Brianne who ripped her mother and caused joannas death. Tywin knows these are not his children, they areÂ King AryesÂ bastards. Tywin arranged for Brianne to be raised byÂ  Lord Selwyn, because we all know how Tywin is ,he didnt want to be reminded every day that Brianne was resposable for the death of the love of his life and she also looks like a targ,Â or if they are Tywins then maybe Joanna had targ blood from her mothers side. It seems I read somewhere that Selwyn and Joanna were cousins.Â Â This also explains why Jamie and Brianne started out as the odd coupl and became close with each other their brother and sister also seems to me that Jamie is developing romantic feelings for Brianne incest thing . It would all make sense .Â Â  Your resposes please.Â Â
1483	Ser Bran Stark	2014-04-07	The actress playing Brienne has targ hair but in the books her hair is described as yellow brittle straw. Sounds pretty creative but not a chance. This would qualify as crackpot theory, plus I don't think it was said that Tyrion "ripped" his mother. She just died from birthing complications...I think.
1484	SeventySeven	2014-04-08	I think you're overthinking it. It was just thrown in there as a joke.
1485	Angmar	2014-04-08	That's an interesting theory I haven't heard before.
1486	Lord Spark of House Spark	2014-04-08	I think you're overthinking it. It was just thrown in there as a joke.


Everyone on Â the forum over thinks their pet theories. It's part of the fun
1487	Hippocras	2014-04-08	Brienne was apparently born the year after the tournament at Harrenhal, which would make her a candidate for Ashara's daughter, but not for Tyrion's sister.
...if the estimated dates are correct of course.
1488	TheFirstofHerName	2014-04-08	Interesting but I'll stick with the theory that Tyrion is a Targaryen.  Ser Barristan Selmy said King Aerys lusted after Joanna Lannister (Tyrion's mother) and I think Tywin knows this which just further fuels his resentment towards Tyrion.  He only claims him in order to protect the family's name and honor. We shall see.
1489	Tixu Oty	2014-04-20	Brienne is like 19 in the books - much younger than Tyrion - so there's no way this is a possibility in the books.
Besides, your premise is all wrong. Death in childbirth has nothing to do with the baby's size. Even if it did, twins are born one at a time. If you're going to hemorhaege, that's going to happen even if your child is super small. I'm also not sure that dwarf babies are smaller.
1490	King Tyrion I	2014-04-22	There's one "thing" people like Tyrion lack: the GH. The _g_rowth _h_ormone.
1491	voodooqueen126	2014-04-27	Also death in childbirth can commonly be due to post partum fever/puerperal??? fever, where a little bit of placenta is left in the womb. A woman I know had it after the birth of her first child, since she lived in the age of antibiotics, she survived, but she distinctly remembers the rotting meat smell all these years later.Â
1492	That Man	2014-04-11	I've already posted this in the nitpicking thread, but since no-one else has picked up on it, but it's very important at deserves it's own thread. There are some key differences in Jon's timeline in the book and the current TV series. I'm a little concerned about the nature of his role at Castle Black, given that:
Â 
He's come back from his journey with the wildlings, but they aren't actually hot on his heels.
Therefore there won't be the small battle in Castle Black itself , with the Thenns. In the TV show they are waiting for Mance's attack, rather than trying to be able to just open the gates for him
Janos Slynt, Bowen Marsh and the other high officers are already back at Castle Black, given Jon the once over before he has any chance to prove himself in battle, like he does in the books
Jon will now have no reason to 'hold the wall' during Mance's attack on the gates, as Donal Noye won't have had that responsibility himself, nor give it to him and then die in the tunnels fighting Mag the Mighty
It's this show of leadership IMO that is a key reason Jon is able to be elected to the role of Lorn Commander. Without this experience he's just a lad who went off and killed The Halfhand and hung around with the Wildlings.
Therefore Jon's future position as LC will be ridiculous on the basis of the internal narrative causality being played out in the TV show
I think they've butchered the story too much for the sake of added drama and are destroying the internal consistency required to carry on the storyline.Â  Unless of course that storyline isn't very important in the long run, which who can really know.
Â 
Do others think he could become LC based on the sequence of events in this episode?
1493	Tixu Oty	2014-04-20	The fact that the Wildlings attack is delayed in the show will make Jon's story in season 4 quite different.
There's talk that Jon will earn some leading credit by going back to Craster's. I'm sure they'll find a way to make his progression smooth and believable.
1494	ToTheWolves	2014-04-26	That sucks because I was looking foward to the "the wall is yours snow" line agh!! Why does this keep happening!?

1495	teemo	2014-04-06	Same old thread as the last seasons  It's supposed to be a place to safely vent any kind of problem you have with the show. Be nice!
1496	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	OK.....
Â 
New Daario.Â 
Â 
I like him and I am not sure how I feel about that.
Â 
I felt from the books that Daario was a distastefully flamboyant person. I felt that the blue beard etc might have come off as being too comedic and OTT for the screen and the smarmy-ness Â of Skrein was a suitable replacement.
Â 
The thing with New Daario is, though, that I feel like I can engage with the character. I am not put off by him... and I think it might work. One of the big issues for me with Dany's Meeren Years was Daario. I think with a likable Daario, Dany's interest in him makes some of her future choices more.... reasonable.Â
1497	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-04-07	New Daario looks more like the actor that played Benjen than the old one did, so he's fine to me.
1498	Newstar	2014-04-07	I know directing isn't D. B. Weiss' forte, but it was amateur hour up in here in the directing department. Not a fan.
1499	Mr Smith	2014-04-07	The dialogue has got to improve. They need to go back to the source material and study Martin's subtlety. They're detracting from what could be some incredible scenes.

Â 
The exposition was laid on thick in this episode. Some of it was fine, but some of it was pretty darn clunky.
1501	The Last Reyne	2014-04-07	I felt the Arya's kill scene was too calculating. I know its a different character than in the book but I just feel like she was too cold. In the book while she starts out cool and calm the bloodlust comes over her and she goes berserk which I felt was really appropriate for a young person going through what she has. She shouldn't have been as calm yet about the killing. That is part of the change taking place in Arya over time. Still a fun scene though.
1502	Ran	2014-04-07	The episode's directed by both Weiss and Benioff. DGA rules prevent both of them being credited, so they agreed to swap credit back and forth.I was trying hard to take Matt Zoller Seitz's challenge to heart, to spend some time discussing the visual composition of a scene, but other than the cold open there wasn't anything really worth remarking on.It is an exposition-heavy episode, but every season opener has been.
1503	Ramsay Gimp	2014-04-07	The dialogue has got to improve. They need to go back to the source material and study Martin's subtlety. They're detracting from what could be some incredible scenes.


Â 
With Tyrion especially, the writers seem to think they can be funnier with his lines than GRRM and that just isn't the case

But didn't she have her berserk moment in 'Mhysa' on the Frey soldiers? I don't think their going to play that up twice. Although I was waiting for to go ham on the guy "is there gold in the village? Silver? Gems? Where's Lord Beric?" But of course that particular guy was dead so it was nice nod to Lommy thou... "the fucks a Lommy"
1505	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-07	Â 
With Tyrion especially, the writers seem to think they can be funnier with his lines than GRRM and that just isn't the case


Â 
A lot of Tyrion's funny lines are actually his thoughts. Personally I'm OK with show Tyrion.
Â 
That being said, Cersei's spy was just terrible.
Â 
Brienne's Renly scene would have been better with Loras (Is he a kingsguard in the show?)
Â 
Joffrey's statue was just too cartoonish for my taste.
Â 
Jaime became Barristan's squire according to the white book, , I don't remember much interaction between them in the show.
Â 
My biggest nitpick is that show Tormund is no fun. In the books he is the best wilding, in the show he's just meh.
1506	Knight of Ashes	2014-04-07	Jesus Christ. Cannibals. It seems that if a show has dead people walking, then it must also have cannibals.

One of the big issues for me with Dany's Meeren Years was Daario. I think with a likable Daario, Dany's interest in him makes some of her future choices more.... reasonable.Â

I preferred that it was something heinous and baffling. It makes her more ... flawed ? believable ?
1508	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	Jesus Christ. Cannibals. It seems that if a show has dead people walking, then it must also have cannibals.


Â 
Yeah, not sure how I feel about that. I thought the Thenns were a more of an organised society than the rest of the Wildlings and that is what lead to a certain other marriage that takes place later.
Â 


Â 
Â 
I preferred that it was something heinous and baffling. It makes her more ... flawed ? believable ?


Â 
Yeah, I am interested to see how it will develop. It may be that a likeable character will work better than the way it plays in the books. Watchers are already baying for Dany to get her ass to Westeros. Her delay needs to be well handled.
1509	Charles Phipps	2014-04-07	Daario is an enormous [insert word referring to one's bottom] in the books and Danny being attracted to him is her being attracted to a bad boy.
New Daario is like being attracted to Aragorn.

I.e. perfectly reasonable.
It loses something if it's an actual romance versus Danny just wanting to bang the hot guy.

1510	SeventySeven	2014-04-07	I thought it was an overall good episode, but as I wrote on the episode thread I watched it at 2 am and I was tired, so it's difficult to nitpick! A few things come to mind though:
Â 
-Tyrion is basically Mr perfect. Since when did he stop having sex with other women after marrying Sansa? I think that if they continue showing him as THE MOST HONOURABLE MAN IN WESTEROS, it's just going to be too jarring to turn him into the man he needs to become by the end of asos. I think they'll get there because PD said in an interview everything will go down like in the books, but I just can't see how, despite the souring of his relationship with Shae and her jealousy.
Â 
- Jon's reaction to Robb dying. Seriously. "I was always so jealous of him"? What?!
Â 
- Brienne and Jaime being in KL already. Yes, we got a nice scene with Olenna/Brienne and the exchange between Jaime/Brienne was nice as well, but it makes no fucking sense. Basically they can't do anything for Sansa because... Well, because they shouldn't be there, so they just don't. Poor, planning ugh.

Â 
I don't think Tyrion is trying to be faithful to Sansa, so much as he's not in the mood for sex with all the murder and threats of violence going around him. He used to think being a Lannister was cool, now it's like living in Caligula's court or as one of Saddam Hussein's nephews.
Â 
I do think Tyrion being a good and honorable man who goes a little crazy at the end is perfectly in-character, though.
1512	Sigrunn	2014-04-07	I would have liked more subtlety in Cersei's fight with Jaime. She seemed pretty much one dimensional.

Â 
Exactly.
1516	Charles Phipps	2014-04-07	It's doubly funny because the guy playing Araario is from Nashville and played a "attractive guy who is kind of skeevy" there.
Â 
On the Shae and Tyrion fronts, I'm hoping everything is a slow burn to Tyrion going absolutely nuts at the end. Basically, he's already half-there but needs the final betrayal by his family to make him go postal with a crossbow. Otherwise, it might just be bad writing.

Re: Nashville, 100% agree - that's how I knew he would be good in this role. Haha.
1520	Charles Phipps	2014-04-07	I had a problem with Oberyn's propositioning of Littlefinger's pimp being all sorts of coercive.
Â 
But, well, that's Westeros.
Â 
Other nitpicks on my end
Â 
* I think we didn't get a good explanation for why Tyrion is celibate so I had to guess.
Â 
* Tywin seemed to take Jamie's ignoring his command too well when he should have been furious.
Â 
* I think Brienne and Jamie's story loses something if they just sort of accept Arya and Sansa being written off.
Â 
* Cersei's reaction to Jamie is just...crazy. The old Cersei would have been passionately into him.

1521	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-07	Well Cersei is crazy, but she wasn't because he was gone, it was because he came back a different man. He's no longer the male version of herself that she can control and manipulate.
Â 
The scene with Jaime and Tywin was kind of a dud. It was a lot angrier and heavy in the books. Here it just seemed like another father/son squabble.

1522	SkaggCannibal	2014-04-07	NO STANNIS???
Â 
just kidding, but I didn't like the Oberyn introduction. Is Oberyn really gonna freak out every time he hears the rains of castamere? And what a pathetic Dornish party was that, every Lord just send his sigil-bearer to the wedding?
1523	SeventySeven	2014-04-07	Re Cersei: Tbf in the books we see her being crazy AFTER she lost a son, before she wasn't a pov so we don't know. Some of the things she did to Tyrion or to her friend, did prove she was never particularly sane to begin with, but it's easy to assume Joff's death is the final nail in the coffin.
1524	Knight of Ashes	2014-04-07	You know, the more Arya walks down the dark road, the cooler her haircuts become. She must've found another hairstylist that's as good as Yorren was.
1525	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-07	Kit's acting has gotten so much better but Emilia's seems to have gotten worse. She just looks really dull and delivers the lines with a tired frustrated tone. 4 seasons in, you think she would invest in some lessons. She treats it like she is on a stage.
Â 
Â 


Â 
That being said, Cersei's spy was just terrible.
Â 


Â 
What was that about anyway?
1526	Lord Joker Of FunLand	2014-04-07	Emilia really is a terrible, terrible actress.Â 
Â 
She really knows how to put a person to sleep with that same-tone-in-ever-scene-with-no-emotion acting style.
Â 
Honestly ruins 99% of her scenes for me.
1527	Debb2	2014-04-07	I love Tyrion, I really do, but what is that accent??
1528	Lee-Sensei	2014-04-07	The Robb wank. I like Robb a lot more than Jon, but come on. Robb was better than him at everything? It seems like with Theon last season, they're intent on portraying Robb as the greatest thing since sliced bread.
1529	Ice_and_Fire	2014-04-07	The whole Jaime and Brienne already being in KL before the wedding is just blowing my mind a bit. I suppose reserve judgement and see how they will handle it in episode 2.Â 
Â 
One thing that stuck out to me was the interaction between Jaime and Tywin. In the book that was so much more heated and you really felt the underlying issues between the two over Jaime's joining the Kingsguard and giving up the Rock. But in the tv show it was very bland and neither character seemed very bothered by it.
1530	Red Tiger	2014-04-07	Daario is an enormous [insert word referring to one's bottom] in the books and Danny being attracted to him is her being attracted to a bad boy.

Â 
* Tywin seemed to take Jamie's ignoring his command too well when he should have been furious.
Â

Â 
Agreed. I loved the fact Jaime was standing up to him. I was taken aback by Tywin just accepting it.
1532	changalang	2014-04-07	Im sorry but I must disagree, he LOOKS like Aragorn, but he lacks the charisma or charm.


Â 
You can tell in five minutes of expositional dialogue that he lacks this charisma or charm? Honestly. As much as I love Viggo as Aragorn, he definitely didn't grab me in his first five minutes of dialogue.
Â 
Plus having watching many hours of Michiel, he has both charisma and charm in droves.
Â 
This thread may be called "Nitpick without Repercussion", but I expected it to be reasonable.
1533	The hairy bear	2014-04-07	I hate recastings. But if you do them, at least try to be consistent with the looks. They should have kept Daario's dreadlocks. (at least for the premiere. If you want to change his looks, then have him cut his hair in order to be more apealing to Dany).
Â 
And I also don't like the apparent softer, more romantic approach they seem to be taking with.
Â 
When Arya stabs Poliver in ASOS, she is screaming and in a mad frenzy. I would have preferred that. In the books, Arya starts killing through Jaqen, then nerviously and out of necessity, then in rage, and only at the end in cold blood. I think the series could have done a better job in showing the transition, since she seems to have been a calculating murderer from the begining.
Â 
As Ran says in his review, we should have seen women riding with the Dornishmen. Lord Blackmont should have been a lady.
Â 
ETA: Shae's inconsistently portrayed. When the plot requires it, she's clever and perceptive. Other times, she screams screams in the palace revealing secrets that could cost her life.

I suppose when Sansa disappears after the wedding that shit is going to go down and they'll start questing.
1535	Milcov	2014-04-07	Oberyn himself was good but his introduction was an annoying way to fill the nudity quota. The actual arrival in the books is perfect.
1536	Dain Storm	2014-04-07	Oberyn's introduction was pretty dumb, and the Dornish party was underwhelming. Should've kept it closer to the books.
Not a fan of the show's portrayal of the Thenns. They've went from most civilized Wildlig group to cannibals.
1537	tyrell19	2014-04-07	my only nitpick is id like to have seen brienne grieve for Cat but apart from that I loved it.
1538	Tyrion1991	2014-04-07	Things I picked up on-
Â 
Â 
Danys dragons never snap at her. I get that they want to hint that her dragons are dangerous and the scene from the pit but it is a profound change. Drogon only ever breaths fire at Dany when hes enraged and injured from crossbow bolts and has been away from her for a long time.
Â 
Daario comes across as too much of a Mr Nice Guy. Yes, the scene with the flowers does get hinted at. But not in that context, hes meant to be this dangerous, amoral and rakish rogue. Not bashfully trying to be cute with Dany. Feels like a lot of white washing coming with this character.Â 
Â 
Considering that this is the series where Jorah gets exiled, seeing him just as a glorified extra. Yes, hes the first secondary character you see in Danys arc but that says little. A little quibble about that. They seem more interested in pushing forward into the ADWD material and stressing the other characters. IMO him being exiled is a big deal for Dany in ASOS. If hes just a long running extra then losing him isn't going to mean anything on screen.Â 
Â 
I find it quite jarring how the Dornish are just introduced. No question.Â 
Â 
The Thenns being like something out of Lord of the Rings.felt kind of cartoonish. I was reminded of the punk guy from Highlander. Going for blatant villains felt a little cheap although they clearly want a central villain for Jon to fight.Â 
Â 
Oberyn sexposition. I get that hes hedonistic and free loving. But, I could not imagine him involving prostitutes and picking out bi sexual lovers for himself and his paramour.
Â 
Don't see what the point is with the Tyrell and Brienne interactions. Loras should have been the only important one to have meet.Â 
Â 
Â 
Good things
Â 
Jon and his trial.
Â 
Jamie and Tywin
Â 
Tywin destroying ice
Â 
Jamie and Joffery with the White Book
Â 
Arya and the Hound
Â 
The dead girl pointing at Meereen. That was really ghastly and will make her killing the evil slavers understandable.

1539	Sun	2014-04-07	This is not a nitpick, it's a real problem with the show for me. Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington continue to be deliver cringe worthy one-note performances. They are so bad, they take me out of the show every time they come on screen.

I generally despise Harrington but I thought he stood out in this episode, which says a lot.
Clarke has about as much emotion in her delivery than a bag of cement singing a b flat.

Â 
That's a good one. It would have been a much more powerful scene having a Brienne/Loras confrontation, if you wish with Marg and Olenna present.
Â 
The problem with having such a huge number of regulars is that sometimes they force them into an episode no matter what. Sometimes, like this one, at the expense of secondary characters.

I'm wondering: are actors billed as "regulars" contractually obligated to appear in every episode?
Cause that would explain why some scenes (like Margaery/Brienne) feel awfully shoe-horned in.
Also: why show the Dreadfort in the credits already?Â
1543	boojam	2014-04-07	STORM OF SWORDS is just chock-o-block with set pieces.As far as I can tell , from the books, we only have two left, the PW and E9's battle for the Wall which will contain both the assault on Castle Black and the big battle , from the north, for the Wall.Now apparently the First Battle for Meereen will be elaborated on the show and not told in flash-back as in the book.(In fact it looks as if D&D have devised a ploy to have a revolt-from-within, tho I guess the sewer sneak attack could still be part of it.)So the Arya and The Hound's tavern fight was moved from the back to the front.It worked fine, but was hoping there would be more elaboration as there was in the book.Note: With the release of that WoW Arya chapter George sure trumped D&D on the Lommey revenge. That was a sweet story, which is gone forever now, I guess.I wonder if GRRM released that chapter after seeing how D&D wrote the tavern fight for the show?I am surprised he didn't show that chapter to them when season 4 was bing planned.Still Arya's killing of Polliver went about the way I predicted it would, thought D and D might give it a little more elaboration so Polliver would REALLY recognize Arya.If season 4 is supposed to be more action packed than ever before, there sure is going to have to be some invention.

Yes, it's entirely possible the Margaery and Olenna scenes in this first episode were there to help make sure they met those obligations.George did show them the chapter. They based the scene on it.

Exposition, gratuitous nudity (although it's in keeping with Oberyn's character it was unnecessary- his introduction in the book worked very well without tits). Then again, it's a premiere. "Valar Dohaeris" was one of the lesser episodes of Season 3 as well.
1546	Dracarya	2014-04-07	Is it too early to expect the Arya/Nymeria dream? I thought it was supposed to run parallel with Catelyn being dragged out of the river. Unless she's been in there for the weeks that have passed since the RW - I can't remember the order of events in the book particularly well. I just hope we see it, at some point.
Â 
Agree with many points in this thread. Jaime & Brienne being in KL too early, the dragon snapping at Dany, Daario, Brienne & Margaery instead of Loras, Cersei & Jaime scenes, and of course the stupid introduction to Oberyn. I thought it was just too much. But they had to get their nudity in, of course. 
Â 
ETA: I presume the necklace that Ser Dontos (who I was glad to see back!) gave Sansa will serve the purpose of the hairnet at the PW?

1547	Jamie Lannister	2014-04-07	This is not a nitpick, it's a real problem with the show for me. Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington continue to be deliver cringe worthy one-note performances. They are so bad, they take me out of the show every time they come on screen.


Â 
I thought Kit was surprisingly good this episode. I really bought his conversation with Sam about Robb's death, and the anger and frustration he displayed at his "trial" felt natural enough too.Â 
Â 
Emilia was predictably cringey though, yeah.Â
1548	franko99	2014-04-07	Not sure if it qualifies as nitpick, but the opening credits, the map moves "west" and reach Essos. Does that mean the sunset sea is that small? That info could be considered as "spoiler" by some  (BTW it enforced my believed that Euron DIDÂ circumference the world on his travel)
1549	boojam	2014-04-07	George did show them the chapter. They based the scene on it.That is interesting.Well I guess GRRM should have shown em that chapter before season 2, I think George says he had that written a long time ago.Alas.â<U+0080><U+009C>Think so?â<U+0080><U+009D> asked Arya, sweetlyâ<U+0080>¦One of the most sweetly clever lines George has ever written.Gone forever now , for the show.

1550	sati	2014-04-07	I really wish we saw a scene with Brienne finding out about RW and being devastated about lady Catelyn.
1551	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	Not sure if it qualifies as nitpick, but the opening credits, the map moves "west" and reach Essos.Â 


Â 
Watch it again. It doesn't move west. It moves to the south, then to the east following the south coast of Essos
Â 


Also: why show the Dreadfort in the credits already?Â 


Â 
Already?
Â 
Why wasn't it shown last season?
1552	Mark Antony	2014-04-07	I really wish we saw a scene with Brienne finding out about RW and being devastated about lady Catelyn.


Yeah I agree.
Â 
I really hated the Margaery/Brienne scene. Aside from the Shae scene that was probably the only thing I dis-liked.Â 
Â 
edit: and New Daario.Â
1553	AdmiraloftheDothrakiSea	2014-04-07	Jon thinking how much better Robb was than him at everything and being jealous of him. Yeah in the books he was kinda jealous since Robb was the trueborn heir but he certainly excelled at things too. I.e. he was better with a sword than Robb. Also Cat used to hate it whenever he did something better than Robb.
1554	Oberoth	2014-04-07	My only nitpick was Thenn cannibalism. Maybe I just missed that part about them in the books.
Â 
The necklace Dontos gave sanas looked pretty.
Nothing conspicuous with that.
1555	tallTale	2014-04-07	I understand where they are pushing Shae, but her character just annoys me.
1556	boojam	2014-04-07	O yes another thought about the Arya Hound tavern fight.One: In the book Arya did not hang back from the brawl as long.Two: She essentially saves Sandor's life, which I think kind of surprised him.I don't mind that they left out his ambiguous 'fatal injury'... they can cook up something else for that later.
1557	Queen of Whores	2014-04-07	Everything in King's Landing feels like a soap-opera and glorified fanfiction at this point. It felt like that in season 3 as well. Too much pointless filler, too little things of actual importance. Although I guess that's what happens when you have to stretch 300 pages over 10 hours....
1558	Belisarius09	2014-04-07	Jaime Tywinn was more heated in the books.
Â 
I don't know how I feel about Jaime and Brienne being in KL before the wedding, I guess we'll see how they play it off. Â 
Â 
So glad they made a shout out to Arthur Dayne! Â Maybe now they'll finally stop merging him and Baristan together. Â I hope they go into more depth regarding the character, and the TOJ etc. Â
1559	protar	2014-04-07	Brienne has the hair to be a Lannister, but Jaime does not!
Â 
I don't have too much to nitpick on though. Most of it was pretty good, with no glaring changes.
1560	RumHam	2014-04-07	They didn't cook the goat! Â I'm pretty sure they even established back in season two that dragons only eat cooked meat too.
1561	protar	2014-04-07	They didn't cook the goat! Â I'm pretty sure they even established back in season two that dragons only eat cooked meat too.


Â 
They can cook it themselves now .
1562	RumHam	2014-04-07	Â 
They can cook it themselves now .


Â 
But they didn't, right? they had torn half it's flesh off and it was all un-charred.
1563	boojam	2014-04-07	ARE THEY EVER GOING TO NAME THE DRAGONS?!Ok so Drogon ,Rhaegal and Viserion are getting a little disorderly , expected.Still remember the Valyrians were dragon masters for thousands of years, how did they do that?
1564	boojam	2014-04-07	They didn't cook the goat! Â I'm pretty sure they even established back in season two that dragons only eat cooked meat too.Dany remembers that in the book when they were just small.I just assumed that the 'cooking' was off-screen.
1565	Batman	2014-04-07	Jaime's hair
Â 
Jon was better with a sword than Robb was.
Â 
Whats with the Thenn scars, did that really need to be a thing?
Â 
How was Emilia Clarke nominated for an Emmy?Â 
Â 
Necklaces? You have limited time for a lot of characters and you're doing a scene about necklaces?Â
1566	RumHam	2014-04-07	Dany remembers that in the book when they were just small.
I just assumed that the 'cooking' was off-screen.


Â 
There's also a scene in season two, I'm almost sure, where Dany and one of the handmaidens give little Drogon meat and he cooks it. Â Anyway my impression last night was that Visereon and Rhaegal had already eaten most of the goat, without cooking it before it landed near Dany.

Â

Her agent decided to throw some money away...
1568	RhaenysBalerion	2014-04-07	I was in fact sort of pleased with this episode, they didn't make a botch of it, as they did of S02E01. There was little wasted screen time.Â 
Â 
Lame things that bothered me:
- How is Jaime 40?

	Spoiler I'm okay with aging the characters, but would it be too much to ask to do that consistently? Jaime spent one year as a captive, which means that he should have been 38 during season 1. Daenerys was aged to 16 during season 1, which puts Robert's Rebellion approx. 16 years before S01E01 Winter is coming. 38-16=22. However, Tyrion states in season 3, that Cersei had become Queen at the age of 19. And by all logic, Cersei and Jaime should be the same age. And Cersei did marry Robert right after the rebellion, otherwise Joffrey couldn't be referred to as being 17 during season 3. I know, I know, I'm lame. 
Â 
- Podric looks like Gendry
Â 
Not lame things that bother me:
- I don't think Oberyn would pay for sex. I don't think Oberyn needs to pay for sex.Â 
- Daario Naharis is still not hot or witty or hot headed or memorable or anything he's supposed to be. Nothing to distinguish him from a random soldier in a random tavern. Not a costume, not any make-up, not a hairstyle, not memorable lines.Â 
- A 5-minute scene in the tavern so Arya can kill Polliver? A 3-minute dialogue between Polliver and the Hound, just so Polliver can die in 5 minutes? Completely useless and unnecessary and waste of time. The fight scene was way too long too. Â 
-Brienne. Another waste of screen time. WTF was that scene with the Tyrells? Fine, Margaery got another chance to be cute and we saw Joff's glorious statue. That was the only point in the whole scene.Â
1569	RumHam	2014-04-07	Â

Â 
Yeah, also his "everyone who works for Littlefinger is for sale" line. Â Does he even know Littlefinger?
1570	Queen of Whores	2014-04-07	^ Not that I'm defending the scene in any way (I hated it) but even in the book Oberyn tells Tyrion that he must still pay for whores, despite being a prince. Not that this really explains it, but it wasn't really a logic flaw completely of the show.
1571	RhaenysBalerion	2014-04-07	Â 
Yeah, also his "everyone who works for Littlefinger is for sale" line. Â Does he even know Littlefinger?


Â 
Yeah, especially that Littlefinger was packing to leave last episode and didn't give a shit about his whores anymore. Plus, he didn't even show up this episode. For which I was grateful, to be honest, but it made that line rather out of place.
1572	RhaenysBalerion	2014-04-07	^ Not that I'm defending the scene in any way (I hated it) but even in the book Oberyn tells Tyrion that he must still pay for whores, despite being a prince. Not that this really explains it, but it wasn't really a logic flaw completely of the show.


Â 
Wow. I never remembered that. Thanks for the reminder!Â 
Â 
I really liked Oberyn, Pedro Pascal was amazing, but that scene with the whore was soooo weird....Â 
Â 
Auch, sorry for the double post. Sincere apologies.Â

1- I have a feeling they were trying to do a clever pre-fight banter scene, but I think it fell completely flat. It looked like they were trying way too hard to reference the Inglorious Basterds bar brawl and failed.
-Brienne herself wasn't a waste of time but why have her have this conversation with Margaery and not Loras? Perhaps we'll have a Brienne/Loras scene next week or the one after that .. but there was potential for a very emotional scene in an otherwise flat and exposition-heavy episode.

That's actually not a bad investment. Michael K Williams has nothing for Omar and yet Emilia Clarke was nominated?Â
1576	Chuck88	2014-04-07	Tiny tiny thing. Ser Preston is still alive apparently. Hardly makes a difference to anything really. Other than that, nothing at all. Arya's scene was slightly different than the book but just as good. Not sure what she's going to do for the rest of the season, though.Â

On this topic, I don't even approve of Game of Thrones itself getting nominated for best drama yet The Wire getting nothing ever. Season 1 of Game of Thrones was fantastic, and deserved to be nominated for best drama for 2011, but even then it's still but a shadow of the quality of The Wire. Who knows how these awards are chosen and given out
1578	Chebyshov	2014-04-07	They're white-washing both Lannister boys (and turning them into brunettes??). That was probably my biggest gripe with the episode.
1579	RhaenysBalerion	2014-04-07	Fight scene was too short!

 I think it would have been better to have a shorter quality fight. This seemed just too lame to me.Â

Â 
I agree, they completely botched that fight scene.Â 
Â 
And well, that's why Brienne was a waste of time. There was absolutely no point to her exchange with the Tyrells. No emotions, no tension, no fans of Renly (or so I think) to shout out to. I was half hoping for a Cersei-Brienne or a Tywin-Brienne scene if it comes to Brienne, because THAT would have been interesting. Not this though :/Â
1580	Cas Stark	2014-04-07	I don't have much to nitpick, I was happy w/the episode, and relieved.
Â 
Don't like the new Daario, he's worse than the old one. Â At least Ed was 'hot'. Â This guy looks like every other guy with brown hair and beard.
Â 
It was a bit random that Dontos gives her the necklace and then is just I guess banking on her for sure, totally, definitely wearing it at the wedding...kind of a big gamble.

I think if the Wire was airing now it would need a wheelbarrow to carry their awards. That was sort of before the HBO publicity machine made every show they have massive for a little while, so I don't think a lot of people knew about it. Back then it seemed like it was just Sopranos and the Wire and Sopranos got all the accolades.Â 
Â 
There are always going to be head scratchers. Emilia Clarke was nominated and Sean Bean was not? Once more with Feeling (Buffy) didn't get even a nomination? Dark Knight didn't get a nomination?

A whole season at least of this will they/won't they... Urgh. It's gonna be difficult. Let's just hope the siege of Meereen balances stuff out.
1587	Ser Jake	2014-04-07	Didn't really like the portrayal of the Thenns. Still have mixed feelings about Oberyn.Â 
Â 
On a side note, the dragons look fucking awesome! They have some amazing VFX on the show.
1588	Queen Sansa Stark	2014-04-07	Don't like the fact that they made Sansa unaware of the escape plan. It makes her come across as an object instead of actively taking part of her escape and asserting some very limited agency. I hate how they go all the way to portray Sansa as a damsel in distress when she is much more than that. Luckily grrm wrote the next episode. So at least he can save the purple wedding.Â

I don't think Tyrion is trying to be faithful to Sansa, so much as he's not in the mood for sex with all the murder and threats of violence going around him. He used to think being a Lannister was cool, now it's like living in Caligula's court or as one of Saddam Hussein's nephews.
Â 
I do think Tyrion being a good and honorable man who goes a little crazy at the end is perfectly in-character, though.


Yeah, I like the way it's done in the books.
What really drives Tyrion over the edge is of course killing his father and his ex-lover, followed by? (I'm not certain of the order of events) learning that Tysha was NOT a whore hired by Jaime.
Then events in Essos conspire to keep him in this amoral survival state of mind most of the time.
It's psychologically believable, concise while still having some subtlety and room for reader interpretation.
Â 
Come to think on it, leaving ample room for reader interpretation seems to be a hallmark of GRRM's writing that doesn't make it into the TV series much.
1590	SuperTechmarine	2014-04-07	This episode was truly bad, in comparison to earlier episodes.Â 
Â 
The dispute between Jaime and Tywin was botched, rushed, and sucked.
Â 
The New Daario i like. Oberyn is fucking great, but i don't see why we need to see boobs to appreciate him.
Â 
The fight scene wasn't that bad, but wasn't all that impressive either.
Â 
Brienne-Margaery was completely pointless.
Â 
Dontos came out of thin air, when he should have been around in Season 2 and 3 instead. And give a useless necklace, instead of the (in)famous hairnet.
Â 
The Thenns were offputting.Â 
Â 
Emilia Clarke still can't act for shit.Â 
Â 
Kit Harrington has improved  (finally).

1591	The_Gallows_Knight	2014-04-07	I hated the inn-scene, it is one my favourite scenes in the books and they did not do it justice at all. It lacked all the tension from the book, the actual fighting was kind of crappy, the dialogue was crappy and no berserk-Arya was disappointing..
1592	Talleyrand	2014-04-07	On this topic, I don't even approve of Game of Thrones itself getting nominated for best drama yet The Wire getting nothing ever.

I'm pretty sure for the awards like best drama the showrunners have to put forwards a specific episode as a contender - which hamstrings the Wire as it didn't rely on having a single big showy episode to win over the voters on and was more of a slow burn
1593	Theron	2014-04-07	Is a small nitpick but it bothered me that when Arya strikesÂ Polliver across the back in the tavern fight, she is using her right hand. Â Arya is left handed and would not have used the sword in that manner.

That's true, but Final Grades is like the best episode of TV ever, although I guess to really feel the emotional punch of certain scenes you need every other episode as context.
1595	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-07	I thought it was a great episode so I don't have much to nitpick. Â I'm just not sure what to think about New Daario, but I didn't really know what to think about old Daario. Maybe he is just a difficult character to make work, but then I think about Captain Hook on Once Upon a Time and to me, that's what I think is sort of the kinda guy Daario should be similar to and I'm not seeing it. But it's just the first episode, so I'll reserve judgment.
Â 
I thought overall it was a great episode - the only letdown being Dany's scenes. The dragons were amazing and that was about it.
1596	boojam	2014-04-07	1- I have a feeling they were trying to do a clever pre-fight banter scene, but I think it fell completely flat. It looked like they were trying way too hard to reference the Inglorious Basterds bar brawl and failed.I thought this was 100 times more funny than Inglorious Bastards.Who could beat this exchange?The Hound: You're a talker. Listening to talkers makes me thirsty and hungry. Think I'll take two chickens.Polliver: You don't seem to understand the situation.The Hound: I understand that if any more words come pouring out your cunt mouth, I'm going to have to eat every fucking chicken in this room.Polliver: You lived your life for the king. You're going to die for some chickens?The Hound: Someone is.Har!!
1597	Le Cygne	2014-04-07	I liked the Daario and Dany flower scene, in the books, she remembered he gave her flowers over and over again in a romantic way.
Most of the Jaime and all the Brienne scenes felt like filler, the scene together was basically, we can't rescue Sansa yet because we're back too early.Â  There was a scene with Jaime trying to comfort Brienne after she learned about the Red Wedding on the way back that would have been better.Â  Cersei was repulsed by his stump from the start so they played that right, I counted nearly a dozen times she mentioned it disparagingly.
Â 
I could nitpick the whole thing, my hopes are pretty low for the show, I just enjoy a scene here and there.

Â 
I thought this episode is already a big improvement over almost every episode from season 3, which I pretty much despised.
Â 
Bringing Jamie back early and having him there for the wedding kind of puts a stake through the heart of 'keeping my oath to Cat' but in the grand scheme of things...compared to some of the insane stuff done last year..it's no big deal for me.

Â 
YES, the actor who plays Podric does look a lot like Joe Dempsie.
It's a bit of a shame that they didn't take advantage of that fact by having Edric Storm appear in the show, played by Daniel Portman.
It would have emphasized the "the seed is strong" storyline quite effectively.
Â 
They didn't wasteÂ tooÂ much screen time with scenes that weren't in the books this time, but I still wish they'd minimize it even further.
Every minute that is devoted to things that don't happen in the books is a minute that they can't use for stuff that DID happen in the books.
1600	Newstar	2014-04-07	If Cersei is 40, I guess that would make Tyrion 36, since Cersei in the show was four when her mother died.

Â 
I thought the scene was nice, but it wasn't really worth bringing them back early. And also, they had to regress Jaime a bit from all the character development he got last season, even though he did pretty much admit Sansa is definitely NOT safe in KL. At least that.
1602	Jslay427	2014-04-07	I didn't like Jamie and Briennes convo about Sansa. Felt like from the point where Jamie arrived in KL his honor is most important to him, and his decision to do nothing was a step back.
1603	ViennaGirl	2014-04-07	Jon was a better sword than Robb and a better or just as good rider. But I don't have a problem with his lack of reaction over Robb's death - I think he was really angry and it came out like self-blame - "I used to hate him..." and now he's dead, damn. I think Jon just doesn't chat about feelings. Loved the trial scene. Can't wait for a block to be fetched.

Â 
I think they were in a bit of bind with what to do with Jaime at the end of S3/the start of S4. They didn't want to leave him hanging from S3 E07 until S4 E03, but didn't want him back in KL early either. It was just a case of picking their poison. Imo it might have been neat to have a final confrontation with Locke in episode 10, (let's say Locke comes after them), resulting in Locke's death or capture (in the case of the latter allowing him to be sent off to the NW in S4.). Then missing out the first couple of episodes wouldn't be quite so egregious in S4.
1605	RhaenysBalerion	2014-04-07	I liked the Daario and Dany flower scene, in the books, she remembered he gave her flowers over and over again in a romantic way.
Most of the Jaime and all the Brienne scenes felt like filler, the scene together was basically, we can't rescue Sansa yet because we're back too early.Â  There was a scene with Jaime trying to comfort Brienne after she learned about the Red Wedding on the way back that would have been better.Â  Cersei was repulsed by his stump from the start so they played that right, I counted nearly a dozen times she mentioned it disparagingly.
Â 
I could nitpick the whole thing, my hopes are pretty low for the show, I just enjoy a scene here and there.


Â 
Â 
That, they played right indeed, but the refusal to have sex...? That wasn't quite so in the books.  And that Mother's altar scene was so epicly funny and gross in the book.Â 
And I absolutely agree about Jaime and Brienne scenes.Â
1606	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-07	I didn't really like Jaime completely ignoring the fact that Cersei is supposed to wed Loras. He just let's it pass, whereas he should be furious or at least irritated.Â 
Â 
Has Jon's accent changed? When he barks back at Slynt about how he lived with the wildlings I felt like his accent suddenly become stronger. Not sure if on purpose.

Â 
I guess you're right, and I also would have preferred an extra made up scene and have them back later. The timing feels off to me, but I can't tell whether it's because I read the books before the show so I've had a certain image in my mind for years now, or because it actually makes little sense in the show context, too.
Â 
On one side I do understand Jaime's hands (I'm sorry) are tied and there isn't much either he or Brienne can do to help Sansa, but still, it's making Jaime look a bit wishy-washy. Although I don't agree with the people saying he's "pfft honour", because when Brienne told him to look at her and tell her Sansa was safe, he couldn't lie. So he's like... On the fence, I suppose. Which I'm not sure was the best choice after his character progression last season.
1608	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-07	Didn't really like the Thenns. Obviously they're not supposed to be as civilised as the others, but they've gone over the top by making them look like borderline emotionless cannibals who look like Orcs. I do like that they're putting focus on Ygritte/Tormund though, so it's not going to just be the good watch guys against the evil wildlings and we'll actually see it from both sides.
1609	Ser Areo Mace	2014-04-07	Jaime became Barristan's squire according to the white book, , I don't remember much interaction between them in the show.


Â 
I thought it said he squired for Ser Arthur Dayne?
Â 
Â 


Tiny tiny thing. Ser Preston is still alive apparently. Hardly makes a difference to anything really. Other than that, nothing at all. Arya's scene was slightly different than the book but just as good. Not sure what she's going to do for the rest of the season, though.Â 


Â 
I caught that as well, it kinda saddens me that there hasn't been mention of Ser Balon Swann joining the KG, I think Loras still hasn't joined either to replace Ser Mandon Moore.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
I've never been a fan of Shae in either medium, she's just annoying to me and I'm kinda tired of seeing her.
1610	FC_Lymond	2014-04-07	Couple of things that haven't been mentioned:
Ygritte (in an earlier season) made a big deal to Jon about burning the bodies of the dead to keep them from becoming wights for the White Walkers.Â  Ok, that's fine.Â  But if the Thenns have been cannibals, presumably for hundreds of years, then both the Wildings and the Nightswatch would already have been careful about getting rid of dead bodies.Â  At least that is how I see it.Â  If you often fight cannibals, you would be wary of just burying your or their dead.
Â 
Oberyn.Â  I didn't like the brothel scene.Â  I don't feel like the actor looks old enough for the character. I bet Doran will look way older than him.Â  TV viewers won't get that they are brothers.Â 
Â 
Tyrion and Oberyn.Â  In the books, when Tyrion lands at Pentos he plans his return to Westeros even before talking to Illyrio.Â  And he's thinking of one place - Dorne.Â  He says it a few times.Â  But here we get a ton of animosity between Tyrion and the Dornish.Â  Tyrion is quite afraid of them.Â  Maybe he grows closer to them later, but from this episode I can't see Tyrion thinking of Dorne as a place to welcome him.
1611	Tyrion1991	2014-04-07	I know.Â 
Â 
The Magnar looked like Azog the Defiler from the Hobbit.
1612	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-07	Jon's reaction to Robb's death was a little disappointing...his brother was brutally murdered...not just his rival.
Â 
I think they should have used this to play on the harshness of his vows (he can't do anything for his family) making him numb, rather than using it as character development in the sense 'always overlooked...life sucks when your a bastard.'
Â 
I'm hoping we get the Ghost reunion with 'I thought you had left me like Ygritte and Robb' to make up for it.Â
1613	MyLittleFinger	2014-04-07	The continuous assault on Jaime Lannister as one of the most feared warriors ever.
Â 
S1 = Eddard verbally jousting with him about how he never faced real men in battle blah blah bah
S3 = Brienne shit talks him saying he sucks at fighting and his reputation is a lie (Despite in her own head saying a weakened hand bound Jaime was the toughest person she has ever fought)Â 
S4 = Joffrey...JOFFREY says he's 40 years old and even with a hand couldn't do anything
Â 
Yeesh. I'm not even a Jaime fanboy, but my friends who only watch the show think he is some kind of a joke as a fighter and would get his ass kicked by Eddard, Robb, Jon...Jorah...and Daario (I wanted to punch the three at that point)Â 
Â 
In the end though, I don't think it will destroy his arc. Just hurt my insignificant feelings.

When Jamies captured they said he killed a dozen men by himself before being taken down. This is in the show. He also wiped the floor with Jory.Â

1621	Tyrion1991	2014-04-07	I think Daario is meant to be closer to how they introduce Oberyn. This confident, suave, sensual, sexualized and stunniny guy who Dany wants to be with. Yes, he gives her flowers and makes OTT professions of love. But its more like how Oberyn in the show talks to Ellaria. Not him looking all sweet and bashful.Â 
Â 
Plus a whole season of sexual tension before these two get together is going to get annoying. Especially since a lot of the contextual reasons why Dany gets with Daario in ADWD don't exist; she won't be encountering the same grim situation n problems of ruling Meereen until next season. Plus, they really should do scenes between Jorah and Daenerys because, hes going to be exiled very soon and I am sorry but his exiles more important to the story than HBO building up to Dany/Daario sex scenes. Iain Glen is a show regular since the first season, Daario is a completely new face; most unsullied would probably be more interested in him being exiled. This isn't a stab at ADWD or Daario relationship per sae. But her being with Daario only becomes important when Quentyn arrives and with her marriage to Hidzhar. Hidzhar may be getting briefly introduced but I don't think anyone believes they'll get married this season; its far too soon. Whereas Jorah being exiled comes at the end of ASOS and has a very strong impact on Dany emotionally; more so than caging the dragons even. Shes shocked when she sees the bones of the child and loses Drogon, but shes not reduced to tears by it as she is when she finds out Jorah was spying on her. Â

Â 
I just always assumed Daario would be this absurdly comical, larger than life character. Â  Always struck me as a wild west pirate. Â Hopefully this new guy can change my mind.

I love the dynamic between Arya and the Hound, which just gets better. But as awesome as "A man's got to have a code" line was, I thought it was silly that Arya was asking why he didn't have any money when she was there when the BwB stole his gold and the reason she's with him is so he can ransom her back to her family.Â 
Â 
I also really enjoyed the Sansa and Tyrion scene (for once), but wish she played an active role in the escape plan.

I've let go of the smaller logical lapses in the show like that. Â I will only still flip out of really big one's like, yes I am still bitter, the nonsensical Mel telling Stannis that the lamb never sees the knife because it spoils the blood and the next scene Gendry shrieking in fear while she drops leeches on him, LOL.
Â 
So, I let it go already about Jamie being in KL while Sansa is there.
Â 
But, I really don't see why they recast Daario, what was wrong with Ed or what happened behind the scenes because the new guy, I don't even get a 'sexy' vibe from him but I know some people do.

Â 
I don't know why they refuse to make up some Jack Sparrow dupe with died beard, give him some cocky lines and be done with it. What are they playing on? Daario is a completely one dimensional character, not hard to portray at all, but they have basically reduced him to zero-dimension. I can't even tell him apart from a random sits-behind-Polliver-in-the-tavern-soldier.Â 
Â 
My problem with Show-Shae is her split personality. There's just no room for both the ridiculous loyal and loving friend to Sansa and the stuck-up full of herself bitch to Tyrion in one person.Â
1631	maidenandwarrior	2014-04-07	I'm really annoyed by this weird plothole that D &D seem to have created for Jaime.
Â 
Setting aside the Sansa issue, which is just lame, they brought up something else which is much more problematic. When Jaime was talking to Tywin, his dad mentioned the precedent of Barristan leaving the KG. But the problem with bringing this up on the show, as opposed to the books where it makes sense, is that Barristan was kicked out because he failed to protect his king (due to age).
Â 
Last night they hammered home twice that Jaime is 40 is his best years are behind him, and they brought up Barristan. So, Tywin desperately wants Jaime out of the KG--so why doesn't he kick him out after next episode when he fails to protect Joffrey?
Â 
Even Cersei wouldn't protest, considering how she was all like, who cares if you are in the KG or in King's Landing. And, I am guessing that she is going to blame Jaime for Joff's death because he was there, unlike in the books. So why will Jaime still be in the KG again?
Â 
Basically, this is going to bug me, because now it makes no sense for Jaime to be in the KG after the Purple Wedding. Sigh.

1633	Buckwheat	2014-04-07	Littlefinger's sigil on the wall of the brothel was all kinds of silly - since when does Littlefinger publically advertise that he owns brothels? Why would Tywin tolerate a man whose sigil is hanging beside a brothel's door in the Small Council? Owning brothels is LF's "undercover" activity, he would not show publically that he owns it. And then Oberyn would, out of all the brothels in the city, walk directly into the one where he can expect the most spies?
I am quite surprised that this was not mentioned before actually.
Â 
I really dislike Shae. And the prostitute-man (I was quite surprised to see him back!) has an annoying face. but maybe I just think so because I think there are already too many prostitutes in the show and those scenes bother me. 
No Ghost. I am pretty sure half the viewers do not know anymore that the Stark children are supposed to have wolves as pets. 
On Jon remembering Robb, I thought Jon did not have quite a good perspective - I think Robb definitely was not better than Jon in everything, but Jon just likes to pity himself from time to time. So what he said about Robb besting him at everything was not entirely objective.

Â 
He's not a Lannister. Â Hence the difference.
1636	Tyrion1991	2014-04-07	Â 
Wot? From the trailer can we see her sitting on a throne in a pyramid. There's also an attack by the Sons of the Harpy. Hizdahr has been cast. This season for Dany will be Book 3-5.Â 


Â 
I assume you are referring to the trailer. That is not an attack by the Sons of the Harpy, you will notice the man is wearing a tokar with graffeti on the wall behind him saying "kill the Masters" and the angry mob attacking him are dressed as slaves which we see in the tunnels having been freed as per the books. The Sons of the Harpy did not fight as an angry mob and their attacks were always knifemen in the dark.Â 
Â 
When they say that Dany struggles to rule its obvious from the trailer that this is about her wanting to restrain her sense of righteousness and desire to punish the slavers. As well as being thematically linked to her chaining her dragons. This is more or less what happens thematically in her final ASOS chapters but the show is tying it to the capture of the dragons; which is doable. How they intend to merge Daarios romance, which is totally unrelated to this, remains to be seen.Â 
Â 
I highly doubt we will see the Sons of the Harpy or any organized resistance to Danys rule this season.Â 
Â 
Â 
Hidzhar only becomes relevant once she agrees to marry him and then there is the conflict with Daario which results. If she agrees to marry Hidzhar mid season 4 with the conflict with Daario then the show would have basically nothing for the characters to do in season 5. It would literally be days from the scene in the pit with drogon. They can't push that forward because the Battle of Meereen is end of season material and they can't invent stuff for Dany to do.

Good point. I assumed all the brothel scenes always happened in the same brothel, that happened to be the one owned by him.
1641	Tyrion1991	2014-04-07	I agree with what others have said. If Oberyn is such a romantic and desirable guy then why would he need to go and hire prostitutes? Surely just travelling to the courts of noble houses and inns/taverns or at tournies in the realm would fit more for whats meant to be an adventurous heroic character. Having to pay for it feels like a poor fit. Especially when he pulls rank on the male pimp. In fact, him and Elaria come across as quite snobbish the way they're acting bossing around the prostitutes and picking over them like choice meat. All that aristocratic arrogance and elitism. Certainly not the general egalitarian and libertarian vibe that the Dornish are meant to exude. Never mind that in previous seasons when Varys n Littlefinger talk it was established that Littlefingers brothels are frequented by pedophiles and necrophiliacs. Do you really want to make this heroic character be introduced in such a place? What does that say about Oberyn? Nothing pleasant. Â

Yeah, this introduction makes Oberyn look sleazy and first impressions are everything. Â Really stupid way to add some gratuitous nudity to the episode. Â And I personally think the actor isn't very good.Â

I agree. The actor doesn't shine. It's such a meaty character to work with and he was a bit blah.Â

Is Barristan Tywin's favourite son?Â 


Â 
I think you are missing my point. This isn't about what Jaime wants, it is about an opportunity presented to Tywin. Are you honestly telling me that Tywin wouldn't see the chance to get Jaime out of the KG and take it? Really? All he would have to do is, in public, make some speech about how it is his pleasure to allow Jaime to retire to the Rock to take up a mantle of Lord of CR, or something. Jaime would have no choice, especially since he has proven that his hand is a problem as he let a king die on his watch.
Â 
This is why this plothole bugs me in the first place, because it never comes up in the books and shouldn't have come up in the show. It is totally pointless.

It does come up in the books though. Tywin wants Jaime to relinquish his duties so he can inherit CR and IIRC he specifically points out that as stupid as Joffrey was to dismiss Barristan it does set a useful precedent. And in both the books and the show Jaime refuses and Tywin can't really do much more short of killing or exiling Jaime. He could make a public speech, but Jaime would just ignore that.
1647	Le Cygne	2014-04-07	But her being with Daario only becomes important when Quentyn arrives and with her marriage to Hidzhar.Daario is important from the start. There's the push and pull, her dragon self (Daario) and the silk queen, and that's happening now. And she falls in love with him, they have to tell that story. She's drawn to him for a reason, and it has everything to do with the overall plot, but even as character development, falling in love with someone is a pretty big deal. You have to show the audience, not tell them.

1648	Roose Seal	2014-04-07	I'm at the point where I hate watch this show. I just don't understand why they would deviate from material that they do such a shit job re-writing. As someone mentioned earlier GRRM 's dialog is streets ahead of what this show is offering us, yet they continue to change entire blocks of it.
That said I appreciated the opening scene, but thought the pelt bit was a step too much.


Is my general feeling too, and has been for a while.
There's nothing wrong with writers who adapt stuff, but I abhor writers who think they are more clever than the creator of the source material â<U+0080><U+0094>or think they can improve on the source material.
Frankly, I've read Harry Potter fanfiction that had dialogue betterÂ than the original dialogue in this show.

No, it doesn't, not in the way I am talking about. In the books, the scene with Tywin and Jaime takes place way later in the timeline. Tywin is all- there is precedent, Barristan opened the door. And Jaime is all, someone needs to close it again. They get in this fight, and Tywin is dead not that much sooner after. There will be what...eight episodes between this argument and Tywin's death on the show?
Â 
This is massively different in the show because Jaime is Lord Commander, serving in the city and at the wedding, when Joff dies. He is therefore responsible, indirectly, for Joff's death--just like Barristan was for Robert's. The fact that there will be no reprecussions for this, and that Tywin isn't jumping at the opportunity to force Jaime's hand and get him out of the KG...it all is just unnecessary. Could have easily been avoided if Jaime's timeline had stayed the same.

Â 
I agree things would have been neater if Jaime hadn't arrived in KL until after Joff's death, but there's still no real problem here. Tywin is already adamant on Jaime leaving the KG before Joffrey's death and yet he can't remove him now. So why would he be able to remove him after Joffrey bites it?

And this is an earlier change, but just one line changed when Loras finds out what happened to Renly, and that great scene with Jaime, Brienne, and Loras is lost, and Brienne telling Margaery she didn't do it didn't quite match that.

Well said. It almost feels like all the scenes have lost their emotional punch, which is sad.
1653	Lee-Sensei	2014-04-07	I agree with what others have said. If Oberyn is such a romantic and desirable guy then why would he need to go and hire prostitutes? Surely just travelling to the courts of noble houses and inns/taverns or at tournies in the realm would fit more for whats meant to be an adventurous heroic character. Having to pay for it feels like a poor fit. Especially when he pulls rank on the male pimp. In fact, him and Elaria come across as quite snobbish the way they're acting bossing around the prostitutes and picking over them like choice meat. All that aristocratic arrogance and elitism. Certainly not the general egalitarian and libertarian vibe that the Dornish are meant to exude. Never mind that in previous seasons when Varys n Littlefinger talk it was established that Littlefingers brothels are frequented by pedophiles and necrophiliacs. Do you really want to make this heroic character be introduced in such a place? What does that say about Oberyn? Nothing pleasant. Â 


Oberyn (and Robert too for that matter) get it when ever they can. I'm sure he can get women without paying for it too.

1654	TeamLannister	2014-04-07	I loved this episode, however like the majority of those in this thread, I had some issues with the tv shows rendition. My main problem was the arrival of Jamie and Brienne. Â On one hand, I can see how Joffrey's death affects Jamie more with him being there and failing to protect him (and how this will cause him to be extra vigilant with Tommen). Likewise, I can see how Cersei's loathing of this new, physically weaker Jamie Â will grow with him being unable to help her son, and the greater significance with Jamie confessing to Tyrion about Tysha. I like these possible routes for Jamie. However, by bringing Brienne back, I see only problems. Brienne just being able to see Sansa and not try to interact with her/tell her about her promise to her mother felt a little out of character especially since we know Brienne knows about the Red Wedding. She's willing to tell Margaery that she still considers Renly a king and that she hasn't forgotten about Stannis, but can't take the time to pop by and be like, "Hey Sansa. Sorry about your family. I knew your mother and don't worry I'm going to get you out of here. Just be patient (insert filler here until Sansa is on the run with Littlefinger and Brienne has to try and find her again)." By bringing in Brienne so early it seems like it'll create a ripple effect throughout later storylines).
Â 
Also, since we didn't get to see Brienne mourn for Catelyn I wished we could've gotten a scene with Littlefinger hearing the news.
1655	Oakenfist	2014-04-07	You guys do realise you're all a vocal minority, right? I mean even shows like True Detective had haters.
Â 
But I'm hoping Stannis this season starts to see some redemption because I think you guys are right when you say the showrunners despise his character, so they continue to make him out to be a headcase villain. From the preview it looks like Stannis, Mel, and Davos will be shown quite a lot let's hope they don't continue to butcher that story.

He does use Brothels. He asks Tyrions recommendation and later says him and Ellaria shared a blonde girlÂ

Â 
In his book introduction, he speaks about brothels and whores.
Â 
Paraphrasing:
Â 
"It's true you increase taxes in prostitution?"
"Yeah, whatever. Dad's idea"
"Ok, then I'll take money, even princes pay taxes"
"What? a brothel? But your wife/lady is hot hot hot"
"Yep, hot. We might want to try something fancy over there, like a blonde"
Â 
He eventually goes to Chataya and beds her daughter (or the other way around).
Â 
Of course, this is H(ot)B(i)O(beryn) and they need to hipersexualise everything because... I whatever.
1658	ovis alba	2014-04-07	Daario is difficult, because I guess if he would have been the "first one", I would have preferred him over the old one, but now I got used to the old one, so it feels a little weird.
Â 
Another thing that feels weird, is Jaime being already there, because it just causes again a shift in the motivation of actually quiet a few characters. First of all Jaime, because Sansa is still there, so he somehow actively chooses to ignore his promise instead of missing her and then of course Cersei being mad at him for being "too late" seems not quiet right yet, because what she is desperatley mad about in the books hasn't happened yet, so compared to that, he is quiet on time 
It feels a little bit like when Cat was releasing him without knowing of Bran/Rickon, they somehow always seem to skip the mother's unbearable pain as a motivation for acting unreasonable (although to be fair, with Cersei I can see their point, she might not need thatÂ   )
1659	Tyrion1991	2014-04-07	Daario is important from the start. There's the push and pull, her dragon self (Daario) and the silk queen, and that's happening now. And she falls in love with him, they have to tell that story. She's drawn to him for a reason, and it has everything to do with the overall plot, but even as character development, falling in love with someone is a pretty big deal. You have to show the audience, not tell them.
Â 
Â 


Â 
In ASOS? In that book, he goes into the tent before the fight at Yunkai, Dany flirts with him for a bit and this is largely a set up for another argument with Jorah. The flowers is only referred to in passing on the road. Then Belwas fights the champion and I think Daario makes a passing comment. Then Jorah gets exiled and Daario makes a remark about going to take his head.
Â 
I certainly would not consider the character to have been as important from the start, in ASOS as he is in ADWD. He only says a few sentences. Dany exiling Jorah is much more prominent in ASOS. Its not a credible argument you're making here. Her losing him and being betrayed by him has a profound impact on Daenerys. Daario has a handful of lines during that novel and is really only briefly introduced. In contrast, Jorah has been with Dany since the beginning and in the books things between them are much more involved and elaborated.Â 
Â 
The answer is that they should have already set this stuff up (novels way) so that Jorah can be exiled when Meereen is taken and THEN they can go on all they want about Dany/Daario. They have all the time in the world to show this to people and its nowhere near as complicated as you are making out. How many scenes did it take for Jon and Ygritte to become an item or to get how eachother felt? Not many at all. Â 
Â 
Daario is going to be with Dany for the season(s) after Jorah is exiled. They have all the time in the world to develop that relationship and pretty much do everything those characters do Â in the books and all the rest. Plus, they already spent half of season 3 talking about how she wants Daario and inventing new material to give him more to do and plenty of chance to flirt with Dany. I think the audience fully gets that she wants him and likes him.Â 
Â 
Just because they are going past the 3rd book into ADWD does not suddenly mean that they should cut ASOS material. Exiling Jorah will fall flat if they don't pick up things with Dany and Jorah where they left off way back in season 2. Hes a glorified extra atm. Why should show dany give a fuck if she loses this guy or finds out he broke her trust? Hell Grey Worm and Missandei got as much attention and stuff to do in season 3; its ridiculous. Just kill the character off if you have no interest in telling the characters story. Â

Â 
Yeah he sounded like such an idiot when he said that and it felt totally unnecessary to have him there. Â 
Â 
Especially since we know that Dany DOES tame Drogon. Which i suppose is the point that Jorah is throwing up the doubt into the audiences minds. But he still sounds like an idiot because Targs have tamed dragons and he never says it in the books and for some reason the show needs to invent material Jorah to do when he has a perfectly good storyline with Dany that they cut for no good reason at all. Its a bit like the Jorah/Barristan scene in season 3. Why invent random crap like that which is mainly just to explain the changes HBO has made regarding what Barristan knows? He has scenes in the books and a story behind them. Why constantly remind me the character loves Dany if you're not going to follow the books and have him do something about it?

Â 
You are saying its perfectly fine for HBO to cut all the Jorah/Dany stuff and are justifying them spending half of season 3 on Dany falling for Daario and are now justifying them doing even more additional material on Daario. Even though GRRM wrote Jorahs exile to conclude Danys story in ASOS? That kind of implies its important and that a lot of pathos is attached to that moment. Even if you discounted the fact that Danys in tears when she finds out, Jorah goes on a mission to take Meereen for her and hes then dramatically exiled with her being so torn up that her hands are left shaking? Even though he spent most of ASOS building the tension between the two up? You just think its okay to cut all of that and want them to focus on Dany/Daario for season after season?Â 
Â 
You are making it Jorah vs Daario
Â 
I do not care how much time they spend on Daario. They've already spent half a season on him. They are going to have many seasons with him and Dany. Jorah is NOT going to stay around for much longer. He could potentially die and never see Dany again. I can't for life of me understand why you think its fine to give Jorah as many lines and as much point to the story as a character like Grey Worm. The show has made him no more important than Boros Blunt or Meryn Trant. Â 
Â 
Daario is not as important as Jorah in ASOS. Do not talk rubbish. Daario gets introduced. Exiling Jorah is much more pronounced and important than her first interactions with Daario. Thats just self evident. Yeah Dany thinks about the flowers in ADWD. But she meets Jorah fucking force ghost in the dothraki sea and she talks about his exile. Â Â

First complaint; Not a lot happened, although I may be impatient since I know there are such big things right around the corner.
Â 
I was really looking forward to getting to know the Red Viper as Tyrion accompanied him to King's Landing. I was really disappointed that this excellent scene from the book was scrapped in favor of making the HBO boobs quota.
Â 
Tyrion is over acting. I love him and he is extremely watchable, but he is doing a lot of mugging.
Â 
To me, the verbal clashes between the characters lacked fire.
Â 
It was painful to watch Arya wait forever (for no apparent reason) to get involved in the tavern fight. Also, I know she has been trained to move like water, but her thrusts and slices seemed too slow and soft to draw blood.
Â 
The Thenns were weird. I'm not a fan of when the show decides to be more perverse than the novels.
1674	mafalda	2014-04-07	Ok, so I have one large nitpick. Nevermind Oberyn's over the top introduction, the stupid spy for Cersei, the fact that Tyrion and shae are still having sex in the books (while calling him her "Giant of Lannister" which makes for a humilating moment for Tyrion later on), Emilia's acting, the new Daario looking like some random camp follower who sits in the grass and picks flowers for Dany (who apparently has no wardrobe budget), the Hound rambling about chicken for what felt like 30 mins, and Arya taking way too long to get in the fight. Nevermind all of that!Â 
Â 
What drives me nuts is that Jaime and Brienne are in KL WAY too early! There's essentially nothing for Brienne to do so they had her go on some pointless walk with Marg, Brienne and Jaime have a nice chit chat about Sansa (oh Brienne did you hear about Cat? It would have been nice to see an actual scene about it!), and wtf @ Cersei turning down Jaime??? When it's supposed to be the other way around! HE turns HER down then she really hits him where it hurts then their entire relationship changes. It's the big changes like these that should be insulting to GRRM because D&D are essentially saying they can tell his story better than he can. I understand sometimes they need to add or take away things for pacing, but to completely change around this story line is insane.Â  
Â 
Sigh. I guess that little banter between Jaime and Joff where Joff insults him will come into play at the wedding. I can see Joff dying, then Jaime standing by and doing nothing because he knows Joff is an asshole. I'm now just wondering about his reaction at Tyrion being arrested for the crime.Â 
Next week looks good though.Â
1675	TeamLannister	2014-04-07	You guys do realise you're all a vocal minority, right? I mean even shows like True Detective had haters.
Â 
But I'm hoping Stannis this season starts to see some redemption because I think you guys are right when you say the showrunners despise his character, so they continue to make him out to be a headcase villain. From the preview it looks like Stannis, Mel, and Davos will be shown quite a lot let's hope they don't continue to butcher that story.


Who's hating on Stannis? I think his character, Melisandre's, and Ser Davos is handled well. If there are haters of Stannis, they'll come around when takes Melisandre's advice and goes to help defend the Wall.
1676	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-07	Oberyn putting his hand ever so slightly over that candle was all kinds of lame. Who the hell does that?
Â 
The Thenns and really all that scene seemed like something out of "The Hobbit" (yeah, not even the LotR). Tormund should be jolly.
Â 
Clumsy exposition. 2 scenes, one after the other, of characters conveniently listing past plot points (Cersei and Tyrion)
Â 
Dontos showing up super late
1677	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	Â 
I thought it said he squired for Ser Arthur Dayne?
Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
If you pause the video on Jaime's page in the Book, it says he squired for Barristan. Wasn't there also a quote from Jaime something about Barristan being 'an artist with blood being his paint' while he was squireing for him or something along those lines
1678	Raksha 2014	2014-04-07	I agree with what others have said. If Oberyn is such a romantic and desirable guy then why would he need to go and hire prostitutes? Surely just travelling to the courts of noble houses and inns/taverns or at tournies in the realm would fit more for whats meant to be an adventurous heroic character. Having to pay for it feels like a poor fit. Especially when he pulls rank on the male pimp. In fact, him and Elaria come across as quite snobbish the way they're acting bossing around the prostitutes and picking over them like choice meat. All that aristocratic arrogance and elitism. Certainly not the general egalitarian and libertarian vibe that the Dornish are meant to exude. Never mind that in previous seasons when Varys n Littlefinger talk it was established that Littlefingers brothels are frequented by pedophiles and necrophiliacs. Do you really want to make this heroic character be introduced in such a place? What does that say about Oberyn? Nothing pleasant. Â 


Â 
To be fair, we know that book-Oberyn has visited brothels in the past; wasn't his oldest daughter conceived and raised (her early years) in one? Â And book-Oberyn is quite arrogant; he's one of the few arrogant characters who is arrogant and elite because of his accomplishments and stills rather than just his rank. Â One has the feeling, in the book, that he would not suffer fools gladly. Â But the brothel scene, at least Oberyn and Ellaria's selection of companions, did feel like a meat market. Â I always pegged Oberyn as someone who prided himself on being a skillful seducer rather than coming across so heavy-handed.
Â 
Maybe Littlefinger's brothel is one of the nicest in King's Landing?
Â 
I did think that the checking out the bods of Littlefinger's prostitutes was more to satisfy HBO/Game of Thrones' nudity quota than to convey Oberyn's sexual prowess and his and Ellaria's sexual appetites/attitudes. Â I would have so much rather had more conversation between Oberyn and Tyrion; because there was an interesting tension and respect (from Tyrion at least) between them rather than the rather forced We're liberal Dornish bisexuals, going for sex and blood in the brothel vibe from Oberyn and Ellaria.
1679	kill alot26	2014-04-07	If they are going to make Dany out to be the be all and end all Emilia needs to get far better at acting she really is not good at all... Kit was incredibly surprising which was great. When we first hear about Oberyn and how he arrived early I was like hmm that's different but in a way kinda bad ass like he don't give a shit but from there his introduction went down the shitter real quick.
Â 
The rest of the stuff I can kinda understand though with tv restraints and having to factor in for the average viewer, like the thenns being the villians at castle black to die and the pointless seens in kings landing.
1680	RoamingRonin	2014-04-07	What drives me nuts is that Jaime and Brienne are in KL WAY too early! There's essentially nothing for Brienne to do so they had her go on some pointless walk with Marg, Brienne and Jaime have a nice chit chat about Sansa (oh Brienne did you hear about Cat?

I understand sometimes they need to add or take away things for pacing, but to completely change around this story line is insane.Â  


Â 
I like Jaime and Brienne being in KL now. GRRM dragged that out too long. Just like he drags out Jaime and Tyrion's reunion. Jaime never visits Tyrion despite being in KL before Tyrion is sent to the Black Cells. If he loves Tyrion so much, why didn't he stop by sooner?Â 
Â 
I wanted to see Jaime and Cersei have sex that one last time but IÂ 
Â 
Dany (who apparently has no wardrobe budget)
Â 

Â 
No one in her crew has a new outfit!  Whoever does their laundry is a pro.
1681	Le Cygne	2014-04-07	The Thenns were weird. I'm not a fan of when the show decides to be more perverse than the novels.


Â 
That's a good point.Â  It's always overkill.Â  It's not like the books aren't perverse enough.
1682	mcbigski	2014-04-07	Â 
If you pause the video on Jaime's page in the Book, it says he squired for Barristan. Wasn't there also a quote from Jaime something about Barristan being 'an artist with blood being his paint' while he was squireing for him or something along those lines


I believe it was more like 'an artist who painted only in red'.

It think they mention something about him squiring in season 1 too. When they are in the room sharing War Stories.
1684	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	I believe it was more like 'an artist who painted only in red'.


Â 
Â 
Yep, that's the one! Many thanks.
1685	bobbybuilderton	2014-04-07	My only nitpick is that Emilia Clarke is still a terrible actress. It is also frustrating that they clearly want me to like Daenerys, but I don't...

Â 
http://img.vayatele....05/daenerys.jpg
1687	MarieAntoinette	2014-04-08	Some minor nitpicks, I liked this epsiode:
Â 
Jaime's lack of golden hair. With all this reference to Lannister and their hair I think that they should be blondes on the show. Same goes for Tyrion who also has darker hair compared to season one.
The "Robb was better at everything" speech
As somebody has mentioned it before, I did not like the lack of horses in the scene where Tyrion meets the Martells. It seems weird that they were just casually standing there.
So far, I prefer the Daario of season 3. This may change in the future.
1688	teemo	2014-04-08	Joffrey starting some sort of tension with Jaime when he was actually dead by the time Jaime got to KL. lol. Â The Oberyn scene was obviously a gratuitous add-in and I think introducing Oberyn in Littlefinger's brothel (the only type of brothel in the show btw) is a sleazy introduction and leaves a negative first impression. Â I like the way Tyrion met Oberyn in the books a lot more. Â We get it, Oberyn is bi and sexually adventurous. Â Yay. Â Anyone else see Ellaria and just think of Niobe from Rome? Hate Arya not having a chance to kill the Tickler since they already killed him off. Â It's hard to nitpick anymore....it's easier to probably name the one or two things I like rather than all the things I hate tbh.Â
1689	CarCrashFiance	2014-04-08	As somebody has mentioned it before, I did not like the lack of horses in the scene where Tyrion meets the Martells. It seems weird that they were just casually standing there.


Lack of horses is always going to be a problem. The horses are costly and when they die on set you get all sorts of trouble. HBO couldn't get through a season of Luck without a few horse deaths. And they literally had world class trainers and doctors on hand at all times for that show.
Â 
How many animals have died on the set of Thrones isn't known publicly. It's certainly not zero. But at this point, after the disaster of Luck, I don't think HBO wants to film with horses unless they are absolutely necessary. Though on the other hand with last night's ratings maybe a million horses could die and HBO would just ignore it
Â 
- - - -
Â 
The thing that bothered me about this episode is that they are lifting lines from The Wire again. "A man must have a code". They are removing lines from ASOIAF to shoehorn in Wire lines. And GOT's writing isn't as good as either shows. Why sacrifice ASOIAF lines for out of context Wire lines? Just to be hip? How long until GoT characters are quoting episodes of Silicon Valley or Girls?
1690	Loerwyn	2014-04-08	Jon's new accent. Holy hellfire where on Westeros did that come from? He spent essentially all of Season 3 with the Wildlings, yet he's only started to talk like one since he got back to Castle Black? On top of that, why did he start to take lessons from Ciaran Hands, whose accent for Mance is beyond laughable?
Â 
The Wildlings are shown to have many different accents (I think Tormund's is the best), but Jun Snuhh is nuh wahldlin' mahn, an' his nuhh voice fer wahldlin's is bahd.

Yeah, that Sandor line really annoyed me. It made no sense for him to say it, unlike Omar. Omar says it because he truly does have a code; he only robs other criminals, and he never hurts an innocent, no matter what. Sandor has no such restrictions. He pretty much just does what he wants. I didn't them like using that line at all, and it felt really random and unjustified. I agree the show should stick to using as many lines as possible from the books; which are far better than the 'original' lines from the show.

Does he? He protects the two Stark 'pups'. He disobeys his king. And many of the larger crimes landed at House Clegane were due to Gregor, not Sandor. I think he does have his own code. Have we ever seen him steal? Have we ever seen him murder without some semblance of a reason? Maybe his code is to find the best opportunities, but I think there is some sense of a code behind his actions. I can't see him protecting Sansa or Arya if he didn't.
1693	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-08	Emilia's acting was torrid.Â 
Daario Nefaris' introduction was stupid and the flower scene was ridiculous.Â
1694	Ran	2014-04-08	Episode 3 will touch on Sandor's code again. I'm not sure whether people will be happy or annoyed.
1695	Nictarion	2014-04-08	edit: and New Daario.Â Well we finally disagree on something. Had to happen eventually.
1696	Nictarion	2014-04-08	Â 
The new Daario is cheesy as hell. Giving Dany those flowers? Really? Felt like something from the BachelorHe gives her flowers in the book. 
					
					
							Edited by Nictarion, 08 April 2014 - 06:18 AM.
1697	Nictarion	2014-04-08	My biggest nitpick was Drogon snapping at Dany. He never did that in the books. The Daznaks pit scene was only because he didn't recognize her, and was being attacked.
1698	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-08	Didn't like he Thenns. Bored with Shae and Tyrion. New Daario is too ''nice'' and because of the excessive brothel scenes in the past I can never enjoy one ever again so even though the oberyn one makes sense because he DOES visit brothels in the book, I was bored already and wanted it to end, and this is whilst introducing an awesome fucking character so thats saying something.
1699	Gendrys Forge	2014-04-08	You wouldn't cast a steel sword like that.Â  Maybe if it were for decoration or something, but not for battle.Â  You cant just pour liquid steel into a mold and make it into a proper sword, the metal would be weak.Â  It was a cool visual and all but it just wasn't right.

In all fairness, it's Valyrian Steel and in the books it's explicitly stated that magic goes into making it. So who knows how it works.

Â 
I agree it was a weird change, but then again, even some friendly household pets will snap at you if you try to bug them when they're eating. It's not really out of place for an animal to at like that. What bugged me was Jorah's "they'll never be tamed" remark following. Tell that to Aegon I. Maybe not "tamed," but "trained," certainly.
1702	Mark Antony	2014-04-08	Well we finally disagree on something. Had to happen eventually.
I'll give him a chance, it's early yet.
Very unimpressed with his scenes in the premiere
And Atia of course when I saw Ellaria all I could think of was Niobe!
1703	Le Cygne	2014-04-08	Episode 3 will touch on Sandor's code again. I'm not sure whether people will be happy or annoyed.Â I think I know what you are talking about.Â  The thing is, most fans of the character have very low expectations for the show, he's been in the background for a lot of it so far.Adding this... I listened to the line again, Arya asks, "Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?" And he answers really quickly, "No." Doesn't sound happy. In the books, he's going on and on about Sansa, he brings her up nearly a dozen times. She was on his mind, and it makes sense that she would be on the show, too. Also they cut from Sansa to that scene.I think this is about Sansa. Arya knows the Brotherhood took his money. So two things stand out, "from Joffrey" and "before you left" - and what did he do just before he left? He tried to get Sansa (Joffrey's betrothed at the time) to go with him, and he was a mess from the fire, and that didn't go so well. And he just left, he didn't make her go with him.I heard a little about episode 3 and this doesn't sound like something he would do, so I probably won't like it. But I don't think he was talking about money in this scene. I think Arya was talking about money, but I don't think Sandor was.

Â 
- Emilia's acting. I think it's actually gotten worse??? (not to mention her annoying eyebrows)
- Jaime and Brienne being in KL already
- the sudden return of Ser Dontos + did they change the hairnet to a necklace? (+ will this necklace subtly end around Margaery's neck?)
- the scene with Ygritte (rose leslie has made me dislike the character even more)
- the interaction between Sansa and Tyrion. It's so OOC for sansa to completely open up to Tyion
- Shae's bipolar behaviour
- Oberyn's introduction. Of course they had to show boobs the very first 15 minutes of the season.
- The scene between Brienne and Margaery and the QoT was absolutely useless
- no Stannis
- Arya's sudden cruelty and calculating behaviour
- the entire Dany plot
- Jon's confession about how extremely jealous he was of Robb

You are saying its perfectly fine for HBO to cut all the Jorah/Dany stuff and are justifying them spending half of season 3 on Dany falling for Daario and are now justifying them doing even more additional material on Daario. Even though GRRM wrote Jorahs exile to conclude Danys story in ASOS? That kind of implies its important and that a lot of pathos is attached to that moment. Even if you discounted the fact that Danys in tears when she finds out, Jorah goes on a mission to take Meereen for her and hes then dramatically exiled with her being so torn up that her hands are left shaking? Even though he spent most of ASOS building the tension between the two up? You just think its okay to cut all of that and want them to focus on Dany/Daario for season after season?Â 
Â 
You are making it Jorah vs Daario
Â 
I do not care how much time they spend on Daario. They've already spent half a season on him. They are going to have many seasons with him and Dany. Jorah is NOT going to stay around for much longer. He could potentially die and never see Dany again. I can't for life of me understand why you think its fine to give Jorah as many lines and as much point to the story as a character like Grey Worm. The show has made him no more important than Boros Blunt or Meryn Trant. Â 
Â 
Daario is not as important as Jorah in ASOS. Do not talk rubbish. Daario gets introduced. Exiling Jorah is much more pronounced and important than her first interactions with Daario. Thats just self evident. Yeah Dany thinks about the flowers in ADWD. But she meets Jorah fucking force ghost in the dothraki sea and she talks about his exile. Â Â 


Â 
I'm not sure if this was addressed yet, but how could Dany have spent half of season 3 falling for Daario or how could the show spend half that season on Daario when he wasn't even introduced until episode 8 last year.Â  Second Sons, right?Â
1706	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-08	@Crackpot ugh i hope not. I dont want that wanker being the Satin.Â

I loved the Drogon snapping though. Puts things in perspective for Dany.


Â 
I don't want that guy to be Satin at all.Â  I don't like LF's Oliver, didn't like the way he looked at Oberyn when he didn't realize the Red Viper wasn't looking.Â  I do suspect he might not want to be a male prostitute, otherwise, why was he trying so hard to get out of any action with Oberyn, but he doesn't have the feel of a Satin type character anyway.Â  Just NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOÂ

Â 
What drives me nuts is that Jaime and Brienne are in KL WAY too early! There's essentially nothing for Brienne to do so they had her go on some pointless walk with Marg, Brienne and Jaime have a nice chit chat about Sansa (oh Brienne did you hear about Cat?

Â 
That is something that I've had on my mind, ever since Jaime and Brienne hit KL last year.Â  The one point that might be good is that it is made apparent to Jaime that the little douche deserved to die.Â  While Jaime comes to that conclusion in the books, I'm thinking perhaps D&D wanted that to be right in Jaime's face, and recently, for all the Unsullied viewers.Â  I suppose they think some must be hit over the head with an explaination of why Jaime doesn't mourn his son?Â

I did like the addition of 'remove her collar before you bury her.'Â  I'm not sure I'm remembering that line from the books.Â  I'm with you on ECs deathglare.Â  She does nail that, but did seem a little sedate this past episode.Â  Perhaps it was because it was mostly a travelling the road to Mereen scene.Â  Looks like the dragons might be the ones eating the best out there in the wilds of Slaver's Bay.Â

1713	RoamingRonin	2014-04-08	So many complaints about Jaime and Brienne being in KL too early. Their arrival changes nothing and works better this way. In the books, Jaime and Tyrion don't reunite until the Jaime goes to free him (which is stupid because Jaime was present for both of Tyrion's trials and could have visited his tower cell at any time). Instead of having Jaime and Brienne sit out a few episodes or have them wandering doing nothing, the writers cut out the glaring waste of time and bow! We got good TV. 
If some of you guys were writing the show, Barristan would still be calling himself Arstan.

Another I'd suggest is 'I, Claudius' from the 1970s if you can get your hands on it. Maybe 10 years since I saw it last and it has kept its age very well.
1718	Rashtibram	2014-04-08	Great episode overall, but I do have a few complaints:
Â 
â<U+0080><U+0093> I wouldn't mind the new Daario if they hadn't completely changed his personality and the way the other characters interacted with him. Just makes for a jarring transition from last season to this one.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+0093> The Thenns felt way too cartoonish and over the top. They felt like they would be more at home in "300" than GOT.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+0093> So Aemon can just override the acting Lord Commander on important decisions? That scene kind of stretched my suspension of disbelief. Also, did Sam ever tell Jon that he saw Bran at the Nightfort? Maybe I'm misremembering, but I don't think Bran made him promise not to tell anyone on the show.
Â 
That's it, I think. I loved the episode.

1719	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-08	Most of the Jaime and all the Brienne scenes felt like filler, the scene together was basically, we can't rescue Sansa yet because we're back too early.Â  There was a scene with Jaime trying to comfort Brienne after she learned about the Red Wedding on the way back that would have been better.
Â 


Â 
Â 
Yeah, Jaime & Brienne's arrival so early is going to have all sorts of follow-on effects, and this is one.
However, it did open up the chance for some negative Jaime / Joffrey interactions, which should make some sense for later events.
Â 
Â 


I agree with what others have said. If Oberyn is such a romantic and desirable guy then why would he need to go and hire prostitutes? Surely just travelling to the courts of noble houses and inns/taverns or at tournies in the realm would fit more for whats meant to be an adventurous heroic character. Having to pay for it feels like a poor fit. Especially when he pulls rank on the male pimp.


Â 
Â 
Oberyn is a libertine by nature, and likes to take chances and provoke people. I can totally see Oberyn throwing that whole "I am a Prince of Dorne, do you dare refuse me ?" at the brothel keeper, more as a sort of cruel jest, rather than really meaning it. Sadly, that's not the impression I got from how far he went with it. The confrontation Oberyn has with the two Lannister men after did seem quite true to character, even though it was a show-only event.
Â 
I'd prefer to have the scene when Tyrion is to meet Oberyn the way it was done in the books; that was actually one of the most memorable exchanges Tyrion had with anyone in the books.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 


Jorah telling Dany dragons can't be tamed. But who was Balerion, Meraxes and Vhagar? Jorah, you're from Westeros. You should know this.Â 


Â 
Â 
Yeah, that was an outright mistake by the show. Of course they can be tamed. Not easily, and perhaps juvenile dragons may have the occaisional tantrum, but if a Targaryen can't manage it, who can ?Â 
I mean, I know why they're introducing that bit into the show, I just think the writers could have come up with more solid reasoning and therefore dialogue.
1720	Colonel Green	2014-04-08	Brienne just being able to see Sansa and not try to interact with her/tell her about her promise to her mother felt a little out of character especially since we know Brienne knows about the Red Wedding. She's willing to tell Margaery that she still considers Renly a king and that she hasn't forgotten about Stannis, but can't take the time to pop by and be like, "Hey Sansa. Sorry about your family. I knew your mother and don't worry I'm going to get you out of here. Just be patient (insert filler here until Sansa is on the run with Littlefinger and Brienne has to try and find her again)." 


Brienne not talking to Sansa at all definitely seems out of character to me.Â  Moreover, since they're removing Sansa's agency from her escape, it's not like they want to avoid having her choose Dontos over Brienne, as she's making no choice at all.Â  So on the face of it, there's no real reason they need to be kept apart.
Â 
It makes me wonder if Sansa not knowing anything about Brienne is going to be a really important plot point in the future.
1721	Le Cygne	2014-04-08	On the bright side, Brienne's little smile when Lady O told her she kicked Loras butt was nice. But bringing Jaime and Brienne back early was a bust, the only good thing is, it will be over soon.
					
					
							Edited by Le Cygne, 08 April 2014 - 11:40 PM.
1722	Angmar	2014-04-08	I didn't like Shae's scene. It seems like every season on most episodes she's jealous or angry and lashes out at Tyrion. It's kinda the same scene and same dialogue all the time...So boring.
Â 
Brienne and Jaime related to Sansa's escape. Again, why? It seems the show's turning the characters into selfish assholes on purpose.
Â 
Cersei bitching out at Jaime for no reason...I just don't get it, really. Why should she be angry at him? For what exact reasons? They write Cersei so contradictory on the show, It's so bizarre...

					
					
							Edited by Angmar, 08 April 2014 - 05:19 PM.
1723	Le Cygne	2014-04-08	My biggest nitpick was Drogon snapping at Dany. He never did that in the books. The Daznaks pit scene was only because he didn't recognize her, and was being attacked.Â 
Yeah, that was especially bad since he is Nameless Dragon #1 (The Big One).  A nice way to tie Khalessi (they don't know her name, either) to the reason she is khaleesi, Drogo.  And the Drogo and Daario plots are tied to her identity, which means a lot in the story to come, she has a very strong connection to Drogon that matters.He gives her flowers in the book.

Yeah, don't get the hate for the flowers scene.  In this cesspool that is the world of ASOIAF, where there are so few tender moments you can count them on one hand, he's making a gesture here that she remembers over and over again.  They do actually like each other, he wanted to see her smile.

1724	Flana	2014-04-08	I seriously cannot understand how they could make the Thenns into these super cartoonish and over the top cannibal people and yet they can't have Daario dye his beard even a little blue. 
Also Jorah calling Dany Khaleesi... Can someone please just call her by her actual name for once.
Â 
Cersei bitching at Jaime seemed off. Like what was her problem even? Joff is still alive so no real reason to be upset (maybe they are trying to play up the crazy in her but I dunno).
Â 
And I did not like the Arya/Hound scene :| They took 2 great book scenes and blended them together kinda loosing the impact of both of them along the way.
Â 
Also Tyrion being the nicest man in all of Westeros bothers me since forever XD especially now since he's suppose to be more bitter at this point.
Bitter, drunk, annoyed at everyone and trying to get into Sansa's panties and break through her courtesy wall.
And Shae being jealous of Sansa is just ridiculous. You're a whore... Just giggle a bit and do your job instead of playing the bitchy girlfriend.
I'm pretty sure they're just going to make her a victim later on. Torturing her to make her testify instead of offering her jewels or something like that, but we'll see.
1725	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-08	â<U+0080><U+0093> So Aemon can just override the acting Lord Commander on important decisions? That scene kind of stretched my suspension of disbelief.

Â 
Thorne is only acting Commander and Aemon has the advantage of seniority and he's very well respected so he can do shit like that. He's the goddamn Maester.
Â 
Anyway, Thorne may not like or trust Jon but a part of him believed what he was saying. I don't think he would have had him executed either way, which is why he didn't put up much of a fight.

1727	Mark Antony	2014-04-08	Where is Ghost?

I did almost order for that.Â  I hate having more and more channels and nothing on, though.Â  I will do it on dvd/blueray or netflix or something someday.Â  I love historical fiction and drama.Â  Hell, I love reading straight history books.Â  Yeah, I'm a reference book geek.Â  


Me too. I read things on the viking age a lot. <3

Good question. We do need Ghost. We need to establish that Jon is, indeed, a warg.

Â 
So Aemon can just override the acting Lord Commander on important decisions?

Because hes muthergrabbin' Aemon Targaryen. Im a huge fan of all things Night's Watch and i observe the Wall stuff in the show with a great deal more scrutiny than the rest. But this didnt dent my willing suspension of disbelief at all, cuz...
Â 
Are you gonna argue with Aemon? :B

Girls like it when a bloke can split her sides.
1733	paddington	2014-04-09	Is my general feeling too, and has been for a while.
There's nothing wrong with writers who adapt stuff, but I abhor writers who think they are more clever than the creator of the source material â<U+0080><U+0094>or think they can improve on the source material.
Frankly, I've read Harry Potter fanfiction that had dialogue betterÂ than the original dialogue in this show.


Â 
I been trying to think of the reason that the brothel sceneÂ  (and similar scenes in other season) are ethier funny, wierd, or just plain dull.Â  I guess the reason is that they are almost all created by the show writers.
Â 
Oberyn's intro in the books was fine, it just felt like they tried to fix something that wasn't broken.Â  Or have to fill a certian nude/sex per episode quota.
Â 
Â The nudity also feels forced/awkward, just wierdly scripted.Â  I wish they would just leave it out, because it's done so poorly.

Well it wasn't as bad as Littlefinger's monologue in season 1 (that was seriously the most awkward and poorly written 5 minutes of television i've ever watched) but it was pretty bad.
I just can't wrap my head around why they would go out of their way to turn one of the most interesting and badass character introductions I've ever read into ... this?
Oberyn's introduction in the books is simple, straightforward, rife with backstory and characterization and in barely a couple pages we learn everything we need to know about this character: he's confident, arrogant, he loved his sister and his family, he doesn't care much for court pageantry and he's not here to take shit from anyone, not even a Lannister.Â 
The show tells us that ... he is bi and he hates Lannisters. I mean, even if you look at it objectively and not compared to the books, this was a weakass introduction.
1735	ladyinblack	2014-04-09	Lack of horses is always going to be a problem. The horses are costly and when they die on set you get all sorts of trouble. HBO couldn't get through a season of Luck without a few horse deaths. And they literally had world class trainers and doctors on hand at all times for that show.
Â 
How many animals have died on the set of Thrones isn't known publicly. It's certainly not zero. But at this point, after the disaster of Luck, I don't think HBO wants to film with horses unless they are absolutely necessary. Though on the other hand with last night's ratings maybe a million horses could die and HBO would just ignore it
how dangerous is it for the Lannister reception party to be waiting on horseback? They are not in a war scene !
Â

Â 
The thing that bothered me about this episode is that they are lifting lines from The Wire again. "A man must have a code". They are removing lines from ASOIAF to shoehorn in Wire lines. And GOT's writing isn't as good as either shows. Why sacrifice ASOIAF lines for out of context Wire lines? Just to be hip? How long until GoT characters are quoting episodes of Silicon Valley or Girls?

I suppose you're rightâ<U+0080>¦I'll need to re-watch that scene, something about it just seemed off and the power relationship between the three judges wasn't explained well (eg. who had final authority).
1737	MoseStark*	2014-04-09	I liked the episode. However, just as everyone is saying, Jaime and Brienne are in KL way too early. Also, Shae is becoming more irritating in every episode, really. I do not hate characters, but Shae is just so incredibly annoying that she comes close.Â 
Â 
I have to say I like new Daario, but that's mainly because Michiel is a way better actor than Ed Skrein was in last seasons. The only thing I'm afraid of is beginning to like show!Dario, because I have a huge dislike for him in te books.
Â 
And can they just stop Jorah from saying Khaleesi all the time? It hurts that show watchers do not know her real name, and I have to explain to them all the time that she's Daenerys and not Khaleesi. Still love Iain Glenn, though...
1738	sellswrd	2014-04-09	* New Daario....nuff said
* Shae. The actor is horrible...just horrible. She and Emila Clarke probablyÂ share a trailer and run lines together or something.
* I know this is way too specific but it bothers the heck out of me that Jon has recovered so quickly from his arrow wounds. I mean, com'n...Ygritte put three arrows into him!! Aside from a wince here or there, he's up and about like he had a splinter or something.
1739	Greywolf2375	2014-04-09	I felt the Arya's kill scene was too calculating. I know its a different character than in the book but I just feel like she was too cold. In the book while she starts out cool and calm the bloodlust comes over her and she goes berserk which I felt was really appropriate for a young person going through what she has. She shouldn't have been as calm yet about the killing. That is part of the change taking place in Arya over time. Still a fun scene though.


I was fine with how calculating she was, I wasn't ok with her expression - there was a little too much glee in it forÂ where she is sposed to be in her arc.Â  that sheÂ did it and how she did it I was all sorts of on board with.Â  just how she looked as she did it.Â
1740	Raksha 2014	2014-04-09	Well it wasn't as bad as Littlefinger's monologue in season 1 (that was seriously the most awkward and poorly written 5 minutes of television i've ever watched) but it was pretty bad.
I just can't wrap my head around why they would go out of their way to turn one of the most interesting and badass character introductions I've ever read into ... this?

Â 
Â 
Yes, I have unpleasant memories of Littlefinger monologuing his deepest feelings and motivations in front of his hired help as they're practicing sexual maneuvers - please, I despise Littlefinger, but he's not an idiot and he didn't get where he is now (or was in Season 1) by wearing his heart and history on his sleeve.
Â 
I wouldn't say that show-Oberyn's intro was terrible; the actor has some charisma; but it seems to me like the show creators were trying to cram too much into a couple of scenes - Oberyn being sexually way Liberated and passionate, arrogant, out for revenge for his murdered sister and her babies, plus the usual quota of nude bodies galore. Â And if they just had to show two or three nekkid girls, couldn't they have had the blond guy disrobe too? Â 
Â 
There should have been a slower buildup to the issue of Lannister forces slaughtering Rhaegar's wife and children. Â As far as I remember, in the show, the only mention we've had of it was Catelyn saying something like 'remember what happened to the Targaryen children' and Aemon saying how his brother's great-grandchildren were killed 'even the little children' (I think he said that in Season 1). Â But the murders of Elia's children was a pretty big issue in the books; the sight of their murdered bodies hugely significant to Ned (and a major reason, in my opinion, why he did not seize Cersei's children when he had the chance and instead gave her the chance to take the kids and run, and instead sealed his own doom); there should have been a few more lines here and there about the tragedy, especially the connection to the Lannisters.
Â 
I will be furious if the show does not fit in Oberyn's wonderful story about his and Elia's visit to Casterly Rock when Tyrion was a baby.
Â 
Oberyn is one of my three favorite characters in ASoIaF; hope they do him justice and not just use him as an excuse to show more sex romps/nekkid girls. Â Oberyn is a passionate individual with a very busy sex life; but there are ways and ways to convey sexuality and seduction and sexual activity. Â The Oberyn I remember in the books might not have been so grabby with the cute blond guy; he wouldn't have needed to be to have his (and Ellaria's) way with him...
1741	TheSpottedCat	2014-04-09	The first thing that bothered me was the representation of Thenns as cannibals, which, imo is contradictory to the books. Plus, it has repercussions for the future. How are they going to support Jon marrying off Alys Karstark to a chieftain of cannibals and making him the Lord of Karhold, one of the most important titles in the North? Unless they're dispensing with this storyline, of course.
Â 
The other thing that really really really bothered me. And I mean REALLY. was the melting of Ice to form Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail. From the, admittedly, very little I know about metallurgy, melting down the sword was the wrong thing to show. When reading the books, I always imagined the blacksmith just melted the middle of the blade and cut the sword in two, and then polished the two pieces to form 2 blades. Isn't the strength of Valyrian steel supposed to come from the way it was forged, and especially from folding it, which caused the characteristic ripples, as well as from the alloy itself? Wouldn't melting basically ruin it?

I know a little of metallurgy but but no means an expert.... and Valyrian steel is magic. I always took the meaning of Valyrian steel from the books to mean the critical point was in the mixing of the alloy itself - not in the forging of the blade. A melt down as depicted does not change the alloy so I don't see a problem on that point. Swords are forged by casting a bar then working it into shape, and giving it its edge. Its the properties of the alloy (and magic) that then allow it to maintain that edge and prevent rusting.
Â 
The book canon clearly says swords can be reforged without a problem - the concept behind what they showed was probably fine. Also given the weapons experts they have on the payroll I would suspect that the process shown was fairly correct too (except they probable missed a few steps)
Â 
Nerdy metallugy warning:
Forging steel isn't as simple as just melting it down. Not all steel is created equal. To get the right properties (based on the structure of the internal molecular lattice) you have to heat the molten metal to specific temperature points, work it until it cools, then reheat so it can be worked further. Alloys make this more complex. Added to this is 'tempering' - plunging it into water.... sometimes its water, sometimes salt water and sometimes oil. The different fluids cool the metal at different rates and result in different molecular structures that provide different properties.
Â 
The varying types of steel is well represented in GoT and other shows - the difference between 'steel', 'castle forged steel', 'good steel to make bodkin points' (the Gendry scene) and 'Valyrian steel'. Even the sword 'Dawn' makes very real-world sense (even if it may not actually be practical)
Â 
Other shows that make a decent attempt at getting it right are 'Vikings' and 'A Knight's Tale'.

Â 
It was also talked about in 3x4 when the Hound is arguing with Thoros. Thoros says, "House Clegane was built upon dead children. I watched them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne." But yeah, it should have been talked about in detail before this point, like in the book when Tywin tells Tyrion about the Red Wedding, they then go on to talk about Elia and her childrens' deaths in some length and detail. Even though it would have dragged out the episode length, that scene definitely should have been kept in, instead of the redundant "Sansa is too young to impregnate" issue.Â 
Â 
ETA: I just remembered that there's a scene in season 4 where Oberyn and Varys are talking in front of the Iron Throne. I have a strong feeling they will talk about the deaths in detail at that point, since it would be significant for Oberyn to be standing in the very spot that his nephew and niece's corpses were placed.

Alloys make this more complex. Added to this is 'tempering' - plunging it into water.... sometimes its water, sometimes salt water and sometimes oil. The different fluids cool the metal at different rates and result in different molecular structures that provide different properties.
Â 
The varying types of steel is well represented in GoT and other shows - the difference between 'steel', 'castle forged steel', 'good steel to make bodkin points' (the Gendry scene) and 'Valyrian steel'. Even the sword 'Dawn' makes very real-world sense (even if it may not actually be practical)
Â 
Other shows that make a decent attempt at getting it right are 'Vikings' and 'A Knight's Tale'.


I don't know much (actually almost nothing) about metallurgy, but I know quite a bit about chemistry, which, I suppose, helps to understand metallurgy. The books say that the process of making Valyrian steel involved folding the steel over itself several times, which is what produced the characteristic ripples. That's why I assumed that the actual beating of the steel into shape was also important for the quality of the sword. I actually imagined a Valyrian blacksmith beating the sword into shape while chanting spells. If that's the case, then melting would disturb the folds created by the original blacksmith. I suppose we'll never know...Â

Â 
Yeah anything we try to speculate on just gets trumped by magic.
Â 
In the real world folding and laminae to the blade which make it stronger and you can have a lighter blade so similar damage output for the same quality alloy/steel.
Â 
In a practical scenario the only way I know of to provide the other properties of Valyrian steel (rust protection and edge maintenance) is through alloying.

When the camera is behind them or filming from one side, there is wind. When the camera moves in front of them, the wind is gone. Camera moves back -> wind again!
Not a big complaint, but it did sort of ruin the moment for me

If that bugs you. don't rewatch the scene where Joffrey casts aside Sansa and the betrothal to Marg is announced. Marg's dress is either dead still or flapping in a stiff breeze depending on the camera angle - and its indoors!

Â 
Cannabilism does not preclude organization. They are an organized killing machine that even other Wildings fear. I see nothing in their dietary habits that would preclude one of their young princes from being wedded to a Northern noblewoman.Â

I will be furious if the show does not fit in Oberyn's wonderful story about his and Elia's visit to Casterly Rock when Tyrion was a baby.
Â 


Â 
Be furious then, because there is no way that's going to make it.
Â 
In my fantasy, GOT would be a 20 episode a season show and with a present/flashback cut-ins along the format of Lost. Â You can probably have a whole episode based on Oberyn's meeting with Tyrion in the present, with flashback scenes to young Oberyn/Elia/Jaime/Cersei at the Rock, to Oberyn finding out about what happened to Elia and arguing for Dorne to back Viserys, to Oberyn leaving for Dorne and getting advice from Doran. Â But such a show would be way too costly to make.

Â 
I'm not sure that they can't fit in the story of Oberyn and Elia going to Casterly Rock.Â  We have the wedding coming (which is supposed to cover a big chunk of the episode, iirc), and then, we'll have Oberyn visiting to offer to defend Tyrion in trial by combat, maybe even the scene with Tyrion 'attending his champion' the morning of the battle, there are plenty of opportunities for this talk to happen.
Â 
Even IF it doesn't happen with Oberyn and Tyrion, I wouldn't be surprised if it somehow comes up.Â  I've seen the added scenes with Oberyn and Cersei, there may be a shot at showing Oberyn with a poisoning opportunity on Tywin, not to mention......he could just discuss it with Ellaria instead.Â  Granted, I'd prefer the conversation to be with Tyrion, considering how his father offered him, just to piss Oberyn's mother off, I think, but still........it could happen.Â  It's a big detail, and I suspect, D&D want us to know this about Cersei herself.Â  They will want us to know that Cersei expected, and was promised by Tywin, to marry Rhaegar.Â  With Oberyn already bringing up Rhae-man and his sister in the first epi, I do think we may get the story of the Martells at Casterly Rock really soon.Â 
Â 
ETA:Â  I'll be really surprised if they don't give us extra Tyrion and Oberyn scenes, quite frankly.Â  But, and here IS where nitpicking could come it, knowing them, that might not necessarily be a great thing.Â  It's a toss up.Â  Still, I expect more from Oberyn than we saw in the books.Â  It is the one thing they can offer the audience with a non POV character.Â

I agree the show comes to a halt every scene with Shae. Just horrible. Jon Snow did walk out with a noticeable limp. Not nearly dramatic as the books

1755	That Man	2014-04-11	So, while I was riding home in the rain and mud last night I had a few thoughts about Jon's timeline in the book and the current TV series. I'm a little concerned about the nature of his role at Castle Black, given that:
Â 
He's come back from his journey with the wildlings, but they aren't actually hot on his heels.
Therefore there won't be the small battle in Castle Black itself , with the Thenns. In the TV show they are waiting for Mance's attack, rather than trying to be able to just open the gates for him
Janos Slynt, Bowen Marsh and the other high officers are already back at Castle Black, given Jon the once over before he has any chance to prove himself in battle, like he does in the books
Jon will now have no reason to 'hold the wall' during Mance's attack on the gates, as Donal Noye won't have had that responsibility himself, nor give it to him and then die in the tunnels fighting Mag the Mighty
It's this show of leadership IMO that is a key reason Jon is able to be elected to the role of Lorn Commander. Without this experience he's just a lad who went off and killed The Halfhand and hung around with the Wildlings.
Therefore Jon's future position as LC will be ridiculous on the basis of the internal narrative causality being played out in the TV show
I think they've butchered the story too much for the sake of added drama and are destroying the internal consistency required to carry on the storyline.Â  Unless of course that storyline isn't very important in the long run, which who can really know.
Â
1756	boojam	2014-04-11	After a second watching , a nit pick observation.Excluding the 1st season, seems Dave and Dan now only do Journeyman duty in sequence writing.They do hit some funny quips , I don't think Jerome Flynn is ad libbing.(I mean when Tryion asks him what he would be after many days horse back ride, he say's "In bed, I'm getting old."Har!)(Peter Vaughan "Kings Landing" quip was really funny.)Wrote some good dialog for Pedro Pascal , the rest is workman like.Scene construction and sequencing is ok, nothing riveting.They still seem to be learning as directors.When it comes to a set-piece from the book (RW and Dacarys) their writing skills come to the fore.The whole Arya-Hound back and forth, the tavern banter and then the fight are just a gem!(I totally disagree with the negative comments about that scene in this thread, it really only differs from the book in details. The whole 'chicken' thing has gone viral on the net, with good reason.)My nit pick is that I hope Dave and Dan are not getting off their mark because the territory ahead is going to take some real imagination and tough work to adapt.Bryan Cogman wrote two this year, we shall see, but maybe he ought to write more.

If it was up to me Bryan and George would be the only writers on the show. Cogman seems only second to Martin when it comes to understanding and appreciation of the books. He's also the guy that is in charge of making sure all the details are correct, like sigils, so he knows his shit. He also wrote Stannis' scenes in 3x5 where he was with his family, which were just wonderful. He doesn't seem to be anti-Stannis like D&D are.

Actually, Cogman devised (and is quite proud of, I might add) the Dragonstone arc for season 3. He's defended the show's portrayal of Stannis quite vocally in interviews and the Q&A session he had over at WiC.net. He said, to a fan who raised the question of whether or not there was an active decision on the show to make Stannis less likable: "look, in the end you and I might just view Stannis differently. I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a â<U+0080><U+009C>villainâ<U+0080><U+009D> but he is a decidedly â<U+0080><U+009C>greyâ<U+0080><U+009D> character, in the books and in the show. He ainâ<U+0080><U+0099>t Ned Stark."
Â 
While I agree â<U+0080><U+0093> him and Martin are definitely the best writers â<U+0080><U+0093> this is something I always feel the need to call people out on when they get too carried away bashing D&D.

In fact I can't exactly figure out GRRM's construction of Stannis as a character, seems to either lose a grip on him or 'underwrite' him often.

I just assumed he liked Stannis more, since the way he was written when interacting with his family was much different than anything else from him (written by D&D) that season.That brings up another nit about D&D.They really have a 'generals eye' like a David Lean or a Stanley Kubrick (and some others) for picking their captains.Production design across the board is just superb, HBO stable of directors (there must be more than the ones they have used... they sure need an 'actors' director for Emilia Clarke who can rise to the occasion, like the first season,... DRACARYS last season, where she seemed a totally different actress!), even final say on VFX , they have an 'eye'.Yet they have said and indirectly it looks it, they are way overworked and seem exhausted. If they could find some other producers on D&D's 'wavelength' I think it would help the show.

Agreed. They probably will just rely on a big reveal for her character.Â 
Â 
Dragging her out of the water and reviving her onscreen would be like reading Tywin/Walder's letters about the Red Wedding. It would ruin the shock value.
Â 
I'm assuming she will be introduced in Brienne's storyline like she was in the books.Â

She's an essential character. She's not written off.

I don't think we have to see the actual fishing out.Â  We already know the Brotherhood is around, and Thoros's abilities were already shown to the viewing audience after the fight with The Hound.Â  I suspect we will just join LS at some point in the story, and then, learn how it was Beric who gave her the kiss and is no more himself?Â

I remember when it started last season, right before the return of GOT, I was worried they were just throwing out some swords and history to get the GoT viewers, actually.Â  I have to say, the commercials look interesting, perhaps I'll give it a try on my OnDemand, once I stop obssessing on ASoIaF and GoT, that is.Â

Â 


These don't seem to be insurmountable, or even that difficult to resolve
Â 
Â  Now that Tormund is reinforced by the Thenns, they could easily raid Castle Black.Â  What Jon THINKS is their plan may not be the ACTUAL plan, or they could deviate from plan.
Â 
The remaining officers could lead rangings north to evaluate Jon's tale, or Sam's or head to the other Night's Watch Castles with ease, or be tricked into following Tormund/Thenns who could raid and then retreat to draw off CB defenders.Â  Jon would not be allowed to go, as he's got a cloud of suspicion over him.
Â 
Once this distraction raid plan has been executed, Jon is one of few left to hold the Gate.Â  Which he then does. And we're right where we need to be.

That's an interesting observation. Â He never actually spoke it, but he instantly responded to Dany's threat about finding a new queen (which was made in the Common Tongue) by dropping his sword.

She's drawn to him for a reason, and it has everything to do with the overall plot, but even as character development, falling in love with someone is a pretty big deal. You have to show the audience, not tell them.


I'd also add that Dany is revered as one of if not the most beautiful women in the world. The only love/lover she'd ever known was world renowned badass Khal Drogo.She looks down her nose at almost every man that tries to gain her favor regardless of their power,ships or armies. It only makes sense for them to cast an actor who would be a "No Doubter". I didn't think Old Daario was that bad other than not looking like the book description, but the eactor seemed to carry the tone,edge and swagger Daario had. I guess we're only one episode into New Daario, but he looks like Rick Grimes, and his jab at Grey Worn didn't come across the way it should have IMHO.
1790	Tormund GiantsMANE	2014-04-12	Â  He didn't speak it this episode, but he understood it. He also understood it in Season 3.


He and Daario spoke in whatever language Grey Worm speaks...they subtitled it and all that
1791	Niamhikus	2014-04-12	Is a small nitpick but it bothered me that when Arya strikesÂ Polliver across the back in the tavern fight, she is using her right hand. Â Arya is left handed and would not have used the sword in that manner.
Â 


Â 
Â 
Its a wierd moment, cos after Arya kills the first guy she puts the sword in her Left hand but in the next shot its in her right. Its wierd cos Im pretty sure maisie trained to use her left hand to stay true to arya so maybe this was just a coreorgaphy change?
1792	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-12	He and Daario spoke in whatever language Grey Worm speaks...they subtitled it and all that


Â I know, but I wasn't talking about what language Grey Worm spoke, I was talking about what language he understood. He understood Daenerys when she spoke the common tongue, and he understood the common tongue in season 3 as well.
1793	boojam	2014-04-12	Daario spoke the Common Tongue to Dany, but Grey Worm only ever spoke Valyrian. It did seem like he understood what Dany was saying, though, so I guess you've got a point there.Got around to checking it.You are right.Hmmm... yeah Dany should have been speaking Valyrian to both of them...since a moment later Daario and Grey Worm have a short conversation in Valyrian.As I have said before, for some damn reason, Emilia seems to be a better actress when speaking Valyrian! I don't mean because it's exotic , but her expression , projection and body language is better... it's odd.(I mean she can do it in English at other times, but can't seem to take a line of 'flat' dialog and finesses it like Charles Dance does.)
1794	boojam	2014-04-12	I know, but I wasn't talking about what language Grey Worm spoke, I was talking about what language he understood. He understood Daenerys when she spoke the common tongue, and he understood the common tongue in season 3 as well.Yeah an since the Unsullied , I think, are slaves culled from everywhere in Essos one would think that some fraction of them speak Common Tongue...In the books George has Essos people speaking all kinds of languages , plus a bunch of variants of Valyrian... tho many of the educated seem to speak High Valyrian.

Â Right, and its easier to understand a language than to speak it fluently, so Grey Worm might be able to follow conversations in the common tongue, but just not feel comfortable speaking it.

Â 
I think it was like swinging a baseball bat with two hands when she struck Polliver across the back so the sword would end up in her off hand. She grabs needle with her right hand and then puts it in her left hand... I think we pay way too much attention to if she's using her left hand or right but most of the time it's not her fault.
Â 
Since season one many times Maisie says she's prepared to use her left hand to do a scene but the cameras have already been set up for her to use her right hand, so she makes a comment about it and then the DP or whoever says "meh"
Â 


Â Right, and its easier to understand a language than to speak it fluently, so Grey Worm might be able to follow conversations in the common tongue, but just not feel comfortable speaking it.


Â 
He's at least twice demonstrated that he can understand common tongue and I don't think it's a mistake that he can.Â

If he's elected leader over all other unsullied captains then he's got to be pretty smart, good fighter and all around good leader right?Â
1797	boojam	2014-04-13	If he's elected leader over all other unsullied captains then he's got to be pretty smart, good fighter and all around good leader right?One thing that always bothered me about Grey Worm and the Unsullied in the books. Was who were Grey Worm's sub-commanders?I mean GRRM did not even have to name them.He sort of had the position of being a general even if he took orders from Dany and her/or her 'captains'.Supposedly the Unsullied were highly organized into fighting units. As an army they were considered so fearsome that Astapor remained un-assualted (even knowing the Astapori also payed off some marauders).As for military effectiveness we have the Battle of Qohor.Got the impression in the books that Dany's Sell-Swords provided the officers tho that is kind of vague.The Unsullied apparently knew military tactics very well.I just can't see Grey Worm saying "Everybody hear me there in the back!"I know the show does not have time to elaborate one second on Unsullied captains, tho seems George could have in the books and I don't remember it ever happening.Seems Grey Worm could be talking at once to a group of Unsullied 'captains' (non-speaking extras) as to what the military strategy is.
1798	Ran	2014-04-13	Hero is named as being a captain of the Unsullied, and acts as Grey Worm's second-in-command. I would guess there are many other such sub-officers.
1799	boojam	2014-04-13	Hero is named as being a captain of the Unsullied, and acts as Grey Worm's second-in-command. I would guess there are many other such sub-officers.Had forgotten that ... some many characters to keep up with it's not surprising that George does not have names for them.As for the show it would be impossible!
1800	boojam	2014-04-13	Since the 'Why didn't Sam tell Jon about Bran' thread got locked...I just wanted to note that on the Red Carpet (the NY one?)Access Hollywood interviewer asked Aidan Gillen why LF didn't recognize Arya in Tywin's quarters at Harrenhal.Aidan looked a little stunned... I don't know if he was being evasive and that's part of the plot , maybe this season.He even kind of repeated the question as if it was a puzzle.Amusing.Added:In season 3 LF does tell Sansa he saw her sister, but right after he said he had seen her mother.So the implication would be that Arya was with her mother.Interestingly Sansa never mentions this to anyone at all rest of season 3.So we shall see how this plays out in season 4.

1801	Simon Steele	2014-04-13	The dialogue has got to improve. They need to go back to the source material and study Martin's subtlety. They're detracting from what could be some incredible scenes.


Â 
Agreed, and what moves this on from minor nitpick to major for me is that we're in season 4, and most of the incredible scenes from the book have already happened.
1802	Simon Steele	2014-04-13	Â 
I thought Kit was surprisingly good this episode. I really bought his conversation with Sam about Robb's death, and the anger and frustration he displayed at his "trial" felt natural enough too.Â 
Â 
Emilia was predictably cringey though, yeah.Â 


Â 
I'm okay with her, but this Kit fellow is one of my biggest complaints in the series. I've never been a huge Jon fan because he's always been too moody and whiny, but the "trial" scene just nails how bad this actor is. He is petulant and pouting and annoying. No matter how much relevant information he had I'd have his head off just to keep him quiet. I'm actually siding with Thorne and that other guy (Slynt? I can't remember) which is a travesty! Why is Aemon calling the shots? IT ALL MAKES NO SENSE.

Why is Aemon calling the shots? IT ALL MAKES NO SENSE.Things have now gotten rearranged from the books for the Wall.Did we ever have Donal Noye?Alliser Thorne and Janos Slynt don't arrive until after the attack from the south.Noye had supported Jon in the defense from that attack.By the by Aemon had the longest time experience and seniority at the Wall , in the book was the one who got Jon let off.I could never figure why Slynt was given any authority at all, head of the Gold Cloak or not, he had not gained any experience or status at the wall. That didn't compute with me in the book either.Also ,so far, they have not played up Jon's popularity among the ranks in the BW at Castle Black, as in the book.Noticeable that Thorne did not contradict Jon about giants when Slynt was incredulous.It is surprising that both in the book and on the show , with a former strong commander, that he would have not weeded out the totally unreliable malcontents... some of whom had criminal records...GRRM constructed a very scrambled and inconsistent picture of the Night's Watch even if the South was not paying attention and letting things go to hell.

Â 
Was he saying that Jon and Qhorin weren't brothers? Â If his point was simply "I knew him longer and better than you did," it was a really stupid response to Jon informing them of the orders he got north of the Wall.

1811	averde	2014-04-06	So were introduced to the Thenn wildling clan this episode, and their cannibals. They are the exact opposite of this in the book, being the most civilized of all the wildlings with laws and metalworking and what not. Did this bother anyone else a ton? Also won't this have pretty big ramifications for the story's related to the Thenn later on?

1812	Bittertea	2014-04-07	Yeah, that really upset me. I mean, I know that most of the Thenns are jerkish, but not really evil. But nope, gotta show they're evulz.
1813	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-07	I think they're not cannibals. They were trying to mock them because they got Jon with them before.
1814	averde	2014-04-07	I think they're not cannibals. They were trying to mock them because they got Jon with them before.

Everything the Thenn guy said was a reference to them being cannibals though. Talking about more food south of the wall and the food being more well fed, the crows getting all fat and "marbled" in castle black. I don't know I really hope your right but it seemed like they were just a caricature of some kind of Pacific Islander tribal cannibals.
1815	Darkbringer	2014-04-07	Nah, I like it. The Thenns were more technologically advanced than other wildlings, but were particularly savage and fanatic in the books. I think in the show we needed someone to come in and show us that alot of the wildlings are fucking savages, and not cheery "free folk" who say "Har". Love Tormund's reaction to them as well.

This. Plus they may exclude Skagos in the show so two-birds-one-stone. I dunno. I kinda like it too. Gives them an edginess.Â Though, i get the feeling that Sigorn wont be the one marrying Alys Karstark later on. Methinks the show may have Tormund be the one.
1817	thenedstark	2014-04-07	My reaction to this change: Kind of meh
Â 
But I wish Tormund was shown as more jovial and fun than he has been so far.
1818	King Tommen	2014-04-07	Styr is a huge villain in the books as well. You want the audience to hate these guys because they already like Tormund and Ygritte a lot. They have to root against someone during the attack.
Â 
I'm also of the opinion that they won't bother with Alys Karstark and the new Magnar on account of that plot probably not really amounting to much in the books.
Â 
AND WHY IS NO ONE MENTIONING THE OWL? THE OWL WAS AWESOME.

1821	Ty K	2014-04-07	They are ancillary characters, it really doesn't matter. Any Wildling can 
	Spoiler marry AlysÂ  Karstark or even do something else that would unite the Wildlings and the North. I think they wanted to add some memorable and visually distinct bad guys among the Wildlings. All the big WIldling characters right now are people we like, so these guys can be the guys we root for the Night's Watch to go after during the battle, which is sort of proven as we see Jon fighting the Magnar in that one production video. He is going to be the obligatory big bad guy the hero has to face one on one.

OooH, I dint even think of Skagos, good catch. Yeah somebody else will have to marry Alys, I thought before that they might even try to merge Alys and fArya somehow. Depends how the show timeline runs, I guess.Â
1823	Darkbringer	2014-04-07	There was an owl?


It was what the Thenns used to warg, and find Tormunds group, At least that was what was implied. It flew away briefly on-screen.Â
1824	King Tommen	2014-04-07	There was an owl?


Â 
Am I the only one that noticed this? Tormund asks Styr how the Thenns were able to find them and Styr nods back at his warg Thenn who's got an owl perched on his shoulder that then flies off the screen. I think the fact that a tribe of cannibalistic warriors who scare the shit out of everybody hang with a guy who wargs into a little owl is both hilarious and awesome.
Â

1826	King Tommen	2014-04-07	What I want most in the world is in E9, for the Wildling attack from the South on Castle Black to be shown in slow motion with all of the Thenns screaming and running headlong into battle being led by that little barn owl screeching right at the screen.
Â 
Make it happen D&D.
1827	intheswamp	2014-04-07	I don't think the episode's writers ever heard of subtlety. It was obvious from the moment the Thenn leader started talking that they were cannibals. We didn't need a 5 minute rant about it.
Â 
It seems that every wilding raiding party has a warg with them.Â  The way Jon specifically mentions to the Watch's council that he killed his group's warg seems to hint at this as well.Â  I guess the Thenns have Owlman.Â

omg loooooooooooooooooolÂ 
Yes please. Battle and owl meet at last. I want Eagle!Orell and Owl and Ghost for beast-on-beast combat.
1829	Newstar	2014-04-07	The cannibalism does seem to scotch any possibility of a [Thenn]/Alys marriage in the show, since for all his pragmatism, I don't think Jon would ever marry off Alys to a cannibal. Doesn't mean they couldn't marry her off to another wildling, even if the show's pretty short on named male wildling non-Thenns to date. I could definitely get behind Tormund/Alys if it came to that.
Â 
Really, though, Alys seems like someone who could lift right out of the show, as much as I love her. Even if the marriage proves somewhat important beyond ADWD, it seems like the sort of thing the writers could get around if they had to.
1830	King Tommen	2014-04-07	If they aren't going to include Val (which appears pretty likely at this point), then I don't see why they'd bother with Alys.

1835	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-07	The only changed I liked was the owl.

So now all Thenns are cannibals undergoing chemo, it should be difficult living in the northernmost named place in Westeros with no hair.

1837	Tuonela	2014-04-07	They are the exact opposite of this in the book, being the most civilized of all the wildlings with laws and metalworking and what not.

Besides portraying the Thenns as more or less brutal with their scary and tribalistic outlook, and way of introducing themselves, I think it really showed off a difference.
Â 
If you look at their clothing and armor; they had these metal/leather plates around, a bit of fur mixed in with the usual leather setting. Somehow it gave, at least to me, this feel of having more focus on their outlook and armor. One of the men was also holding a very fine Tolkien dwarwish axe with engravings and whatnot, which gave a very clear image of them knowing their way around crafting and smithing.Â 
Â 
Somehow couldn't stop thinking about these ruff dudes gnawing Sam's nice.. and fat.. juicy.. arm. Especially after that fine meat speech.
1838	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-07	Omg owl? I totes thought that was Eagle!Orell. I need to rewatch soon.Â 
Wow, that's what I thought too.
The cannibal thing bothered me when I first heard about it, but I've come around on it. I can now understand the reasoning behind it.
And I've always been 99% sure that Alys will be cut from the show. It makes me incredibly sad, but I can also understand the reasoning behind that.
1839	Darkbringer	2014-04-07	OMG. Just had a flashback to Mance introducing Tormund to Jon as 'this chicken-eater'. Kind of funny, now. Nice touch, if done on purpose. Â
1840	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-07	The Thenns ... well, no I did not like the cannibal implications. The rest was okay; Styr being a badass and someone who can clearly throw down vs. Tormund if push comes to shove.

Even before then, the Wildlings are going to get slaughtered at the Wall. It's not going to be the Night's Watch coming off looking heroic killing a bunch of refugees fleeing the Ice Zombie Apocalypse but will be less of a problem if half the Wildlings are psychopath face-eaters.

I would argue that Mance, Tormund and Ygritte have already made the wildlings quite sympathetic so far. We have only heard overtures about how they kill and steal. So far its just been "we are the real northerners, kneelers, its our land too!" Im glad to see the diversity that we know is there, and that some of them are savages.Â

Agreed. There's still plenty of time to further the dynamic of the wildlings throughout the season, especially if Jon does go over to "negotiate" with Mance.
1850	Ice_and_Fire	2014-04-07	The cannibalism did bother me. But I really liked the visual of the Thenns, shows nicely that the blanket title of 'wildlings' doesn't clearly show how diverse all the tribes actually are, and emphasises to people who haven't read the books how unique that Mance actually managed to get all these people to fight together.Â 
Â 
However it does make me wonder how they will handle the Alys storyline, if at all. I mean it didn't really add much in the books so I could see it just being cut all together, unless George knows that it is vital for Winds.
1851	The Mediocore Ron	2014-04-07	I've got to say, when they started talking about cannibalism I was afraid Rickon was in the bag.

It makes sense, like people have already mentioned, to show that the threat of the Wildlings is actually a real threat. Nice jolly people in furs does not constitute such a danger, they're not portrayed unreasonable, you'd wonder why they don't all cooperate in some way. The cannibals show you why. They put the wild in Wildlings  (sorry lame joke)
1853	The hairy bear	2014-04-07	Mel_Rose,
Â 
The problem is that at the end, the point of the story is that those wildlings were not the real threat and that they were not that bad. The entire plot of ADWD revolves around this. If they are not significantly better than the White Walkers, why should Jon ally with them.
Â 
Also, Alys Karstark is supposed to marry one of those men. They are people, no mindless savages.
1854	King Tommen	2014-04-07	I don't think the impression left was that these Thenns are "mindless savages". They clearly are cunning warriors and formidable foes for the NW.Â  They've cuddled up too many of the Wildlings, there needs to be legit villains within the group for the NW to face off against.
Â 
Not to mention that in the books, Styr was a massive asshole who deserved to die and the Thenns were all hated by the other Wildlings. I'm not sure why everyone is retroactively characterizing them as some kind of noble entity.
Â 
I'll bet someone a million internet dollars that Alys Karstark isn't on the show on account of her story not being important at all.
1855	Mel_Rose	2014-04-07	Hairy Bear, 
I agree with King Tommen above. I don't think they look like "mindless" savages. They do look terrifying though. And they are a threat because they eat people. And in the end, they might be not different from us all, but at the moment, in the show, they have to show a more formidable enemy for the battle of Castle Black. It might not be very accurate to the books, but personally I liked it.
Â 
I doubt Alys Karstark will be on the show, too.

They're as bad as the people of Westeros and that's pretty bad. There's a reason Jon doesn't want them getting over the wall and it's not just his oath, it's that they're going to lay waste to the North and as much of the Seven Kingdoms as they can.
1857	Dany's Golden Fleece	2014-04-07	I love the cannibalism change. It was to make sure to the viewers that the wildings are not plucky free folk characters, some of them are very disturbing individuals like in the books. Hope we get to see the Weeper next season :-) . I also love the Thenn look and also the music that accompanied them.Â  The OST is getting better and better every season.
1858	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-04-07	I didnt like them. If D&D want to create a creapy wilding group create a name of their own. Or any other insted of the group more westerosi alike of the entire gang.
1859	Guard of the Rainking	2014-04-07	The show Thenns were very underwhelming. The design of the clothing was cool, but Styr was so corny.
1860	Logodnica	2014-04-07	When I saw the Thenns, all I could think of was "Poor Alys Karstark."Â  Then I realized that that storyline is so far into the future and so minor that they obviously cut it.Â 
Â 
Also, didn't I see these guys in the 13 Warrior.Â  #FailD&DÂ  #whatbutchery
1861	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	Well according to the scene in the Cave, Ygritte did shag a Thenn boy once, and she wasn't eaten afterwards.Â
1862	King Tommen	2014-04-07	From this site's own Wiki:
Â 
The Thenns are savage fighters, but because of their belief in the Magnar as their god they are absolutely obedient and more disciplined than other free folk. They are often better equipped than most free folk, with bronze helms, axes of bronze and a few of chipped stone, short stabbing spears with leaf-shaped heads, shirts sewn with bronze discs, and plain unadorned shields of black boiled leather with bronze rims and bosses
Â 
Yeah they aren't cannibals and they certainly changed their look up but I really don't get what the big outrage is here. What did people expect? The Thenns are clearly the rigid asshole villains of the Wildlings and they need to build up Styr as a major antagonist for Jon during the battle as we know they engage in one on one combat there.
1863	GHOSTSTARK	2014-04-07	i was a little surprised by that but imo it showed the viewers that havent read about all the wilding clans and theyre not all the same
1864	SuperTechmarine	2014-04-07	Though, i get the feeling that Sigorn wont be the one marrying Alys Karstark later on. Methinks the show may have Tormund be the one.


Â 
Aw, hell no!
1865	-Ghost-	2014-04-07	The main Thenn, is it Styr or Sigorn?, is pretty fuckin badass. I liked them. As soon as I saw the sack I knew it was a person in there.
1866	King Tommen	2014-04-07	Styr. In the books, Sigorn is his son but I imagine he won't be on the show.Â  Joseph Gatt is an actor of some note and he was cast as the Thenn warg (henceforth known as owl-boy). If there is another Thenn that they will distinguish from the extras besides Styr, it's him.Â  I don't think he has a name at this point.
1867	Howlin' Howland	2014-04-07	They seem to have written Skagos out of the show (Rickon's headed to Last Hearth).Â  If Skagosi cannibalism is a major plot point in the last two books they might be combining the Skagosi and the Thenn for the show.

Â 
Just standard Westeros foot-stamping about the show not being the books.
Â 
Personally, the Thenns are my favourite character introduction in the show thus far.
1869	protar	2014-04-07	Honestly the Thenn introduction was one of my favourite parts of the episode. When you're introducing new minor characters at this point, you can't afford for any to be Milquetoast. So the scars and the cannibalism worked for me to make them identifiable. The Thenns are still very savage in the books, but they also have metalworking and a more unified government, which makes them very dangerous.
Â 
I tend to think the Thenn marriage to Alys will still be in, otherwise there's little point in introducing Styr at all. We'll see I guess, maybe he's just there for flavour for one season, but they don't really have the time to do that imo.
1870	briantw	2014-04-07	I didnt like them. If D&D want to create a creapy wilding group create a name of their own. Or any other insted of the group more westerosi alike of the entire gang.


Â 
I mean, why do people care so much about minor details like this? Â The Thenns are only of passing importance in the books. Â Yeah, they've been changed on the show, but in the grand scheme of things it's not a change that really has any serious future implications (any wildling can marry Alys Karstark, if she exists). Â It's simply there to make the wildlings look like the threat they were in the books.

Oh, good point about why they even bothered introducing the Thenns. Maybe they'll introduce Sigorn as being a lot less creeptastic if they do keep Alys in? Styr was unsettling, but I loved every second of it.

Â 
I think Styr was important to introduce because they need to build up a fearsome antagonist for Jon to defeat during the Battle. Tormund and Mance survive (presumably) and Ygritte's death will be tragic but not one the audience will want to see.

One of the problems I had with the Battle of Blackwater in the books and show (and the Battle of Helm's Deep in LOTR) is that it's this massive setpiece battle where no one important dies. The stakes are kind of low there.
Â 
I think if there are people lost on both sides (like perhaps Aliser Thorne or Grenn) during the battle, it becomes a much more dramatic sequence. Otherwise, all you've got is a bunch of faceless extras getting filled in with arrows.

That is true, although you've got Ygritte dying, possibly Thorne and whoever takes the place as Noye (I'm thinking Grenn). It's possible Styr's just going to be a one-off villain for Jon, but with D+D talking about how they've got to be conservative with characters it seems weird. Hard to make any educated guesses though without TWOW in our hands. Maybe Alys is super important, maybe she isn't.
1874	Lord Bored	2014-04-07	The Karstark/Thenn alliance is nothing short of a waste of time so I can see why they thought they had nothing to lose by putting a cannibal twist on them.
I love the change though, regardless. They're looking to be deliciously fun as secondary villains. More than likely we're looking at a one season deal if we're being realistic but whatever. As long as they're used well, I'll be happy.

Â 
We've seen shots of Jon and Styr fighting each other one on one during the battle so my best guess is that Styr loses that interaction.Â  They could certainly have more plans for the Thenns in the future but I think the main priority now is to make them a very dangerous foe for Jon during the battle.

Â 
Re: Thenns
Well, fwiw, there are cannibals among the wildlings, that is stated several times in the books. But no, it's not the Thenns, and none of the cannibal wildlings have significant presence in the book. David and Dan basically just combined two wildling sub-groups, the Thenns and the ice river clans.

The creation of a new noble house that allies Free-folk with Notherners was kind of an important thing that Jon did. I'm sure they'e going to cut it, but it likey will have repercussions in the books.

Â 
They can just brush it off by manning more ot the castles on the wall. I doubt the marriage would really have that much effect on the whole story.
1879	Dany's Golden Fleece	2014-04-07	Its going to make Jon' eventual decision to take in the Wildlings look much more questionable and dangerous - you could see why people of the Night's watch would freak out at his decisions.Â  That is admirable of D&D, they are not taking the easy way out.
1880	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-07	I think in addition to giving Jon a true villain to fight during the battle, they also did it to add tension to the free folk's storyline itself, since we'll be following Tormund & Ygritte as major characters now (which I'm thrilled about). It's one thing to just have Tormund say he hates Thenns for some vague/undisclosed reason; but they immediately give him a very solid, understandable reason.
Also a good point, GoldenFleece2.

1881	Rishav Banka	2014-04-07	I hated that the Thenns were made Cannibalistic. Loved their faces though! Those lines on the face and the baldness made them badasses in my book the second they walked onto the screen.
I also don't like that Thenns were introduced at all infact. If the wall would have been attacked simply by the wildling we love, then the fight between them and the night's watch could have been an emotional treat. Now obviously people are gonna want the Thenns to die.
1882	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-07	They are cannibals, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are less organized. The way they entered the wildling's camp was pretty structured and disciplined. They may still have a more developed infrastructure than the other wildings, and just happen to eat human meat.

I think we could meet her in the battle if Jon goes to assassinate Mance and she and Dalla are in the tent with the baby. They HAVE to have the babies in the show, because it's the whole entire plot of book 5 (right?). I think we have to have Val! She's so awesome with Queen Selyse...

Â 
If she was going to be in E9 we would have heard about her casting. She could theoretically be introduced in S5, but that's cutting it very fine to introduce the baby switch plot before Sam is sent off to Oldtown. I guess we'll see whether she's mentioned at all in S4, it's not unreasonable that we wouldn't have heard about her given we only had 3 episodes of Mance in S3.
1886	FCOS	2014-04-07	I think it was a pointless change. There are clans that are cannibals mentioned in the book who could have been used instead. It also didn't show off any of their bronze armour or equipment.
1887	Tears of Lys	2014-04-07	Am I the only one that noticed this? Tormund asks Styr how the Thenns were able to find them and Styr nods back at his warg Thenn who's got an owl perched on his shoulder that then flies off the screen. I think the fact that a tribe of cannibalistic warriors who scare the shit out of everybody hang with a guy who wargs into a little owl is both hilarious and awesome.Â I NEED MORE OWL.I noticed the owl. And yes, more owl is always a good thing.
1888	Flou	2014-04-07	Yet another pointless change. If they wanted bad ass cannibals in the show, why not have the real cannibals from the books in the damn show. Seems to me that whole Alys Karstark subplotline will dropped, or she will be married to someone else as I don't see bunch of cannibals settling Karhold.
Â 
Other than that I really loved the introduction. Wildlings need to be seen more an a threat and really evil. Tormund and Ygritte are hardly evil. And with the way they introduced the Thenns I'm sure the viewers will remember them.
1889	Oakenfist	2014-04-07	They can easily just change the wilding who marries Alys, and I could see them making it Tormund as an alternative choice in the show.

The Thenns in the books are still very savage despite their more organised culture. Cannibalism doesn't necessarily mean they're complete animals, for example in the books the Skaagosi have a house system similar to mainland Westeros despite being cannibals (supposedly).

I'm not sure if Val makes it into the series, maybe they keep Ygritte alive and she becomes the Wildling princess, what the hell is a Wildling princess anyways? There is really no such thing. The thing that would argue against it is the part her death plays in Jons character growth.
1907	jarl the climber	2014-04-07	Hairy Bear, 
I agree with King Tommen above. I don't think they look like "mindless" savages. They do look terrifying though. And they are a threat because they eat people. And in the end, they might be not different from us all, but at the moment, in the show, they have to show a more formidable enemy for the battle of Castle Black. It might not be very accurate to the books, but personally I liked it.
Â 
I doubt Alys Karstark will be on the show, too.


Actually I think Alys might stay in. The Karstarks all march home in season 3 after Robb took off Lord Karstarks head, thousands of them abandoned Robb, didn't make much sense in a way but that's what happened. So it does seem like this house will be important going forward and Jon will have to repair relations like he did in the book, so I'm more like 50/50.
1908	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-07	I'm not sure why anyone would have a problem with this, really. As was the case with Blackwater, the battle at the Wall isn't going to be as clear-cut as 'good guys versus bad guys'. There are characters on both sides of the conflict that audiences will both root for and against, as it should be. The people at the viewing party I was at were quite intimidated by the Thenn's, because they had just assumed that the majority of the wildlings '...weren't bad people; just misunderstood.'Â

1910	Bonesaw	2014-04-07	Thenns are now cannibals in the show, there will be no "House Thenn" and there may not be any marriage. Its easy to hate a cannibal and root for Tormund, who seems sane compared to these guys. Or maybe the Karstark girl shows up and marries...Tormund?? I like the theory stated above. I too was put off by their looks, they are brutal and intimidating. How do you settle a group of cannibals in Westeros?

1911	Mel_Rose	2014-04-07	This was one thing that didn't bother me in the least. First, because I have little to nothing recollection from the books of what the Thenns are like, and second, because I really don't see why it makes a difference that a random Wilding tribe is cannibal or not. I kind of expected something more dramatic, than an arm, like a head or a whole corpse or something, but that arm was not even closing to disturbing or disgusting, in my opinion. Especially compared to the mob scene when the crowd tears off the High Septon's arm and raises it in victory which was, to some extent both (disturbing and disgusting).Â 


Â 
Me too! I expected a torso, that bag seemed kinda full. (I started watching Walking Dead the other day so my gore-guts-and-blood tolerance is pretty highÂ   )

I got the impression they were cutting off the arm before putting it on the spit.
1913	Anderly	2014-04-07	Thenns are now cannibals in the show, there will be no "House Thenn" and there may not be any marriage. Its easy to hate a cannibal and root for Tormund, who seems sane compared to these guys. Or maybe the Karstark girl shows up and marries...Tormund?? I like the theory stated above.

Â 
I dunno, how do you settle a group of human flaying Boltons, semi-nomadic frog eating Reeds, and primae noctis rapist Umbers in Westeros? Â The North is full of wild weirdos. Â I didn't mind the merging the ice river clans with the Thenn. Â I think it makes for an interesting contradiction, in that the Thenns are simultaneously more civilized and less civilized than other wildlings. Â I see the Thenns as largely a continuation of the vestigial capability for savagery of the First Men as already observed in House Bolton.
Â 
I hope Alys hasn't been completely cut though (she doesn't even need to be cast for the unveiling of House Thenn to be announced). Â Some people say it doesn't play a significant role in the books, but we still have two books left! Â It might be immensely important.
1914	Anderly	2014-04-07	I got the impression they were cutting off the arm before putting it on the spit.


Â 
The arm was a bit lame. Â For effect, they should have pulled out some barely-live peasant, hacked his limbs off and stuck him straight on the spit.
1915	Jasta11	2014-04-07	Mel_Rose,
Â 
The problem is that at the end, the point of the story is that those wildlings were not the real threat and that they were not that bad. The entire plot of ADWD revolves around this. If they are not significantly better than the White Walkers, why should Jon ally with them.
Â 
Also, Alys Karstark is supposed to marry one of those men. They are people, no mindless savages.


Â 
The Southrons have their Cleganes and Boltons, the Wildlings have the Thenns. That's diversity, and not a bad thing at all. Not every wildling has to be a nice, hearthy Tormund methinks. I think it was time they reminded the audience that there are bad people everywhere.
1916	Darryk	2014-04-07	I liked it. Made them a bit more impactful for the non-book reading audience.Â 
Â 
If they were introduced as the "most civilized of the wildling clans", I think the Tv audience would have lost interest in them pretty quickly.
1917	King Behind The Wall	2014-04-07	Â 
The arm was a bit lame. Â For effect, they should have pulled out some barely-live peasant, hacked his limbs off and stuck him straight on the spit.


Â 
such noble thoughts
1918	adamski24	2014-04-07	Hated the cannibal idea so much. Â It just plays in to the ignorant Southron stereotyping of what Wildlings are like and why they shouldn't be allowed past the wall.
And Tormund has been such a let down, he's nothing like he is in the books. Â He actually made the Wildlings seem normal
1919	C0bR	2014-04-07	Thenns were the worst part of the episode. This "heel turn" (more like a demon turn) does not make sense at all.
1920	SandorsRedemption	2014-04-07	This is the second hint that the show won't introduce Alys Karstark. The first was Melisandre meeting Arya when visiting Dondarion's lot so she can't mistake Alys for Arya anymore. I'd find it quite disturbing if John gives Karhold to a bunch of cannibals.
1921	Chebyshov	2014-04-07	This is the second hint that the show won't introduce Alys Karstark. The first was Melisandre meeting Arya when visiting Dondarion's lot so she can't mistake Alys for Arya anymore. I'd find it quite disturbing if John gives Karhold to a bunch of cannibals.


Â 
Good catch! I didn't think about that being an implication of the Melisandre scene the first time around. Too bad; I would have liked the settling of Westeros with the House of Thenn's creation (one of my favorite things Jon did as LC), but I get why they'd cut it. Ultimately, I trust the show runners to know which auxiliary plot-lines to leave in and which not to.
1922	King Tommen	2014-04-07	Thenns were the worst part of the episode. This "heel turn" (more like a demon turn) does not make sense at all.


Â 
Yeah, I mean those guys in the books were pretty saintly if I remember correctly. Never described as "savages" that I'm aware of (oh wait, the Wiki on this site says exactly that, my bad).
Â 
I am really curious as to what people imagined the Thenns to look like. Bald warriors with no ears who fanatically followed a leader, forged vicious weapons, didn't get along with any other Wildlings and fought with giants all the time. Sounds like they were pretty tame dudes.
1923	The hairy bear	2014-04-07	The Southrons have their Cleganes and Boltons, the Wildlings have the Thenns. That's diversity, and not a bad thing at all. Not every wildling has to be a nice, hearthy Tormund methinks. I think it was time they reminded the audience that there are bad people everywhere.


Â 
But the Thenns are supposed to become Jon's allies. The point of Jon's arch in ADWD is learning to treat the wildlings as real humans, and that will be difficult to swallow with cruel canibals.
Â 
And while as you say variety is good, depicting everything in extremes is not. You can have the Thenns being a little bad, or quite bad, or even very bad, without the need to having them be outright monsters.

Â 
I imagine the Thenns will all be wiped out during the battle at Castle Black so you won't need to worry about what Jon does with them since there won't be any left to deal with. Someone's overthinking things it appears.
1925	Chebyshov	2014-04-07	The fact is, they've done a pretty poor job at really getting the TV audience to understand how serious the Wildling threat is. Â The Thenns being so clearly brutal was a perfect way to set the tone for the stakes. I didn't mind the change, and it made for a pretty foreboding scene.
1926	King Tommen	2014-04-07	The Thenns won't be players after this season. They're being set up to be fodder for the attack in E9 and Styr is being built up to be Jon's big adversary during the battle that he'll have to kill.
Â 
People reading any more into this are getting inside their head too much.
1927	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-07	I think it added to the Thenns' overall appearance. Made 'em seem even more fearsome. So far none of the Wildlings have given off a very dangerous and scary aura. But the Thenns are completely different. Would not like to face them in combat as a Night's Watch member.
1928	Inv1ctus	2014-04-07	The Thenns won't be players after this season. They're being set up to be fodder for the attack in E9 and Styr is being built up to be Jon's big adversary during the battle that he'll have to kill.
Â 
People reading any more into this are getting inside their head too much.


Â 
I think you are right. They probably combined Thenns and Skagosi right here and they're building the Thenns up for the big battle for the wall and Styr's battle with Jon. Later Jon will just make a pact with other wildlings and maybe someone else will marry Alys. if that will even be a part of the story (not likely). On the other hand they can still make a later turnaround that only some Thenns were cannibals. I personally liked the overall appearance of the Thenns with those scars and all.
1929	averde	2014-04-07	I had two huge problems with it though. 
1- the Thenn represent the real historical barbarians though, like Gaul or Germania from Roman times. Very savage but with a very unqiue and fairly advanced society. I was really excited to see them. 
2. ASOIAF is so largely based on the grey characters and no one being wholly evil or good. It's especially one of the main themes involving the storyline between the Nights Watch and the Wildlings. I thought of the Battle at the Wall being a tragedy for both sides, making it impossible to root for either team.

1930	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-07	Didn't like it. Looked like a bunch of leftover extras from the movie Doomsday.Â 
Â 
What I DID like though, was the showing of Wildlings as NOT being united beforehand, really hammering home that MANCE is bringing these people, who are VERY different and usually HATE each other together. I just think they could have done that without the fucking naff look so bald and scarred and creepy UGLY = EVIL bullshit. If they were Skagosi, I'd be like HELL FUCKING YEH, Thenns? Uhhh....OK then....
1931	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	The fact is, they've done a pretty poor job at really getting the TV audience to understand how serious the Wildling threat is.

Â 
This.
Â 
One of my biggest issues of S3 was that they completely dropped the ball with Jon's story and the nature of the Wildlings. Yes, there are elements of Mance's Army that are 'Free Folk' and viewers would identify with their cause. But that alignment means people won't invest with the NW in the coming encounters - and won't invest with Stannis when he arrives. TheyÂ need to establish there are in fact brutalÂ Wildlings about to fall on the Wall. They have to show that we are supposed to be rooting for the vastly outnumbered NW. If they can't pull that off, then Stannis's actions lose their meaning, and Jon's diplomacy also loses its meaning.
Â 
I am happy to sacrifice the marriage of a very inconsequential third tier character in favour of the actual important characters.
Â 
They can make as many of the Wildlings as brutal, immoral, barbaric and rapacious as they want, in fact, theyÂ must do this.

Here here! The majority of the people who are upset by this change were probably fans of Alys.  I like her myself, but I'll happily sacrifice it for good storytelling. Especially because, as you said, Jon's diplomacy wouldn't have had its meaning.
1933	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-07	I think the striking appearances work. As you say, it hammers home the diversity of all these Wildling cultures.
Â 
Just because some Thenns are cannibals, doesn't mean they all are.Â

Tormunds reaction to seeing the Thenns is also telling. Â  Â  "I Â $^@&ing hate the Thenns"
1936	GallowsKnight	2014-04-07	Tormunds reaction to seeing the Thenns is also telling. Â  Â  "I Â $^@&ing hate the Thenns"I loved that line. Tormund has been all over the shop the last season but that rang true

1937	The Sullen Sellsword	2014-04-07	I don't mind that they added cannibalism to their culture, but the way it was introduced was about the least subtle way you could have introduced it.
1938	DominusNovus	2014-04-07	Adding cannibal wildlings to the mix makes me hope for a conversation between Ygritte and Jon before she dies...
Â 
"Oh, by the way, you asked why we're fighting you? Â The Thenns eat people, thats a good enough reason for me."
1939	Van beyond The Wall	2014-04-07	Yeah, not much of a fan of this version of the Thenns. Crazy is already more than abundant north of The Wall. The Thenns of the books represent a proud and established society of laws and with a semblance of industry . Its a bummer to see that missing. Fanatical is one thing, bat shit insane another...

This.Â 
Â 
No bronze armor and no Magnar. You see brutality in Giants and Knights, Crazy in Joffrey. They could have gotten this one little thing correct. Show that the Wildlings are smarter than Ser Allistor and Slynt.
1941	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-08	. Show that the Wildlings are smarter than Ser Allistor and Slynt.


Â 
Â 
But then the audience would be barracking for the Wildlings instead of the Night's Watch and that removes the effect of Stannis coming to their rescue. The WildlingsÂ need to be painted as the bad guys in the coming battle to justify the redemption of Stannis. That is far more important than rosey-eyed vision of an unimportant culture from beyond the wall.

1945	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-08	Who cares if it was subtle or not? It was a cool scene. The Thenns made a huge impression and they'll be remembered by the viewers. Mission accomplished.

1946	Hippocras	2014-04-08	I agree with a lot so posts here. It was a very large deviation from the books, but it served an important purpose:
1. It introduced cannibalism, which is relevant in the books because of Skagos but Skagos will be cut from the TV show so they needed another way.
2. It helped barbarian-ize the wildlings in the build-up to the war at the Wall.
3. It is not groundless. 
I am pretty sure it was the Thenns at Mole Town who were giving Jon the most trouble after they came South of the Wall. It was also them who went around carving new terrible faces in trees around the Gift, in spite of their supposed conversion to R'hllor. The are several book hints of some vicious Old Gods practices, via that terrible Weirwood at Whitetree Village where they found the bones of a human child in the mouth. Craster's mother was from Whitetree village also. So we already know that the Old Gods are as grey as anything else in theses books and have an evil side. That needed to be clarified and the Thenns were a way to do that.

1948	jet199	2014-04-08	I think the Thenn/Karstark marriage could still go ahead. I think it is easy to assume that Alys has been saved by the marriage but that is not certain. The Thenns being so weird will emphasise how "out of the box" Jon's idea was and what a revolutionary thinker he is in ADWD. However it will also make it more understandable if Alys does get rejected and/or killed by her fellow northerners.
1949	HannibalStark	2014-04-08	So were introduced to the Thenn wildling clan this episode, and their cannibals. They are the exact opposite of this in the book, being the most civilized of all the wildlings with laws and metalworking and what not. Did this bother anyone else a ton? Also won't this have pretty big ramifications for the story's related to the Thenn later on?


of all the changes this is one that I think bothers me the most...The Thenns are the closest thing to "Lords" (Magnars) the Free People know or have...my guess it seems to have only been done to make them "scarier"Â  rather than actually introduce more actual distinct clans....
Â 
The Thenns above the others are more important I think to the story (at least in the books so far) but I think its BECAUSE they hold themselves apart from the others as being the closet remaining survivors to what the First Men left behind...they are important because they are civilized and I think the whole reason Jon is able to reasonably marry the living Magnar to the heir of Karstark...who in their right mind would marry "kin" to known cannibals? ...and give them Karhold as a result?
1950	The Fourth Head	2014-04-08	My first impression was that it was unnecessary- Styr's gait was too "Uruk-Hai" for my liking, and it seemed over the top- like the character assassination of a whole group of people.
Â 
However, in one fell swoop, it humanised Tormund brilliantly- and Tormund is more important as a character than Styr. I felt a ambivalent towards Tormund in season 3 because he spent as much time threatening Jon as he did playing with him. Now Tormund is wholly sympathetic.
Â 
But I don't think the benefits end there. After all, we are the readers of Summer, and Winter has come. I don't think Canniballism does equal savagery. We have been given a very unpleasant introduction to Cannibals by Styr- but at this stage, south of the wall, cannibalism seems unnecessary, and he will soon die. We were given a very unpleasant introduction to Jamie Lannister too if I recall, but he is fast becoming a hero, despite throwing children out of windows. GRRM loves his grey.
Â 
Blatantly, there is a growing trend towards Canniballism in ASOIAF- hell- who didn't cheer Frey Pie! Even southron fools and lords, who who aren't being portrayed as "evil", but as normal, desperate men are partaking in eating the dead. I suspect Bran has, unknowingly, done the same- and it's the reason he's still alive. If conducted in an organised manner, with rules, it could make the difference between the survival or death of a society- where a leader's morals could doom his whole people and risk him being killed and eaten himself- which could result in anarchy. In fact, I like the challenging concept that a cannibalistic society can also be a disciplined one. Furthermore, we have yet to meet Styr's son- he may come across as slightly more "palatable" if you get my drift. You have to be tough to survive in winter. I think GRRM will genuinely force us to consider cannibalism as a valid survival option without having to hate those who take part.
Â 
This fits in perfectly with the changing attitude, with time, towards the Thenns. Jon Snow will need men on the walls. He will need to appease Styr's son, as rations fall slim, Jon will be forced to either kill them all, or risk them eating all the locals. It cranks up the pressure on Jon in ADWD. What better way to appease this group of well behaved, cowed, but dangerous prisoners, than gifting them Karstark lands, and all the non-human food to be found there? I doubt very much the Magnar would tolerate his wife being eaten. That doesn't make any sense at all, and as we start to see how the Wall can cooperate with cannibals who come across as fairly civilised after-all, despite first impressions, the insidious path towards embracing cannibalism will continue.
1951	Hippocras	2014-04-08	Palatable.

vicious old Gods yes.....just like in Brans vision he sees a woman with a bronze sickle slice open a mans throat in front of the heart tree in the Winterfell Godswood made me think of the Thenns...I can 100% see them as being vicious, but vicious is one thing, preferring the marbled man meat of kneelers so they can enjoy eating them more is another.Â  There seems to be a lot made about blood sacrifices before weirwoods and with how the Thenns more closely resemble the First Men than the others.Â 
Â 
So much as I can remember , eating people is a wee bit different from blood sacrifices though...and I don't recall cannibalism being associated with the Thenns or the First Men in any way.
Â 
I guess its one way to show that the Thenns don't get along with the other Free Folk...and there is/was at least one Wildling group that does eat people I think, besides the Skagosi.
Â 
I kinda liked the Thenns in the books though...and the canablism was more alluded to than out right shown.Â  But maybe this will mean Rickon is hiding with the Thenns in the end of the show?

1956	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-04-08	I'm not too bothered about them being changed but why not just use the actual cannibal clan and keep the Thenns civilised?
1957	Ravenstooth	2014-04-08	They did not need to mess with the character of the Thenns. If they wanted cannibals they should have used the ice river clan. If I remember correctly the Thenns see themselves as the last of the first men.

I liked the idea that with the Thenns we had a glimpse of what westerosi culture might have been like before the andals.
Which may still be true even if they were cannibals. I mean how do we know the First Men were not cannibals? So far the Northerners seem quite vicious in general. The Skagosi are reported to be closest to wildlings AND are reported to be cannibals, so connect the dots. The Hill Tribes are like the First Men, and they burn their body parts for fun and wear ear necklaces.

I agree.Â 
Â 
Could have kept the Ice River clans, they COULD have made the Thenns pretty intimidating, but why make them look like extras from Mad fucking Max and are cannibals to top it all off???
Â 
They could have showed divide between the wildlings better and the whole 'you should eat crow' and close up of the arm was so naff, i'm sorry.Â
1960	The Fourth Head	2014-04-08	Cannibalism does not have to equal vicious- it just does in Styr's case because he's a nasty guy, but I would imagine you get all sorts of people in Thenn society just as you do in other groups, or other families. Assuming they are all vicious is prejudice, based on disgust and fear- as expressed by Tormund- but hating Thenns doesn't men all Thenns are hateful- all of which applys to the Skagg's in the book.
Â 
Considering the Magnar has absolute control, they could have all manner of laws and codes that they abide by strictly and to the letter on pain of death. Ie- never kill a fellow Thenn. Never eat an ally. Only eat the enemy. Use fear and prejudice of Canniballism to your advantage by intimidating the enemy and making yourself look scary. Only eat your enemies as as symbolic deterrent. (note- Styr wants to dictate strategy to Tormund and the dead Crows work well as a means to an end- ie, Styr was probably laying it on a bit thick, because it suited him- all that talk about Marbling etc) Or- when facing starvation, rather than walk off into the snow to die, or kill your children than watch them suffer like the summer-softened northerners do, be a man and offer yourself up to the rest to improve your family's chances of survival. Offer your blood to the heart tree and hope the COFT will protect you from the Others. There is nothing vicious and savage about any of that- it could all be highly rational behaviour.
Â 
In Summer, The Thenns may well choose not to eat any human flesh- it;s just a last resort when facing starvation, or to intimidate/deter the enemy, and to appease the gods. Otherwise, they eat normal food.

Bear in mind that they only have a limited amount of time to show everything. It could well be that they decided they couldn't justify introducing two new wildling clans, and so had to merge all the traits they wanted into a single clan. They would then have chosen the Thenns because they are named, with characters who had at least a minor role in the book. The ice river clans were only briefly mentioned.

I agree. There just is not enough time and budget to introduce too many types of wildlings. We are going to have to go with the ok ones like Tormund and the very scary ones like the show version Thenns.
1963	King Tam Stark	2014-04-08	They reminded me of Victor Kruger from The Highlander movie.
Â 
Haven't read through the thread but the tv thenns are possibly merged with the skagosi, one of the Skagosi Houses is Magnar so maybe they are trying to merge that house with The Magnar of Thenn.
1964	Rhaquentis	2014-04-08	There are still many episodes to go, many chances for the audience to love/hate the characters yet  They went with the badass/dark intro for the Thenns for now. At least they will be memorable?

I understand this and it doesn't mean I have to like everything because of the ''budget''Â 
I like the fact that the Thenns were scary and that Tormund didn't like them, but I just think they were really cartoony and the whole cannibalism thing just made me think of the movie Doomsday.Â

Won't the tv watching audience balk at Jon letting the wildlings in.Â  Can you imagine the audience reactionÂ with Jon discussing strategy with a Thenn?Â  Interesting move by D&D.
Â 
I am actually starting to understand the fears of Bowen and co thanks to the show haha funnily enough.Â  Bringing cannibals through the wall voluntarily, wow, when you think about it.


Â 
Jon was able to bring a whole lot of wildlings who were certainly bad and/or vicious people through the Wall. Â He was willing to bring in others who were even worse (like the Weeper). Â This wouldn't be out of character at all for him, especially if he comes to an agreement with the Thenns that they have to drop their cannibalistic practices.
Â 
That, of course, is assuming any of them survive.
1968	The_Gallows_Knight	2014-04-08	I think the worst part of the cannibalism was that it was introduced in such a silly way. The arm on the spit looked more comical than anything else, like something right out of a goofy splatter-movie.

All I am saying I can understand Bowen Marsh's viewpoint a bit more now, when I have seen it visually.Â  It's very easy to make agreements, much harder to keep them.
1971	King Tommen	2014-04-08	Some people have such specific complaints, it honestly baffles me. Was there really that strong of a push from the ASOIAF fanbase to have the Thenn's depicted as 100% accurate on the show? Where did this come from?
Â 
I feel like sometimes people just make up things to get upset about because they see something that's different than the novels and then have to retroactively go back to find a reason to be offended by it.
Â 
Based on the sheer number of cuts to the overall story that have to be made, we're pretty damn lucky that the Thenns even appear at all.
1972	Hippocras	2014-04-08	The Thenn's role right now is to be the scariest wildling yet. Then later, when they come past the wall, they will be the biggest pain in Jon's ass aside from Thorne and Marsh.
Then he will manage to civilize them somewhat, and their reward for good behaviour will be Alys Karstark, whose story may be merged with Jeyne Poole.

The book purists at this point have just begun complaining for the sake of complaining. None of them actually gives a shit that the Thenn's aren't really cannibals, just that it's not exactly the same as the book so it's just one more thing for everyone to moan about.
1974	Sam with Hooters	2014-04-08	Anderly wrote about the flaying Boltons, frog-eating Reeds, and rapist Umbers.
You're putting these on the same moral plane?Â  Seriously?Â  You're definitely not from Cajun country, are you?Â  Frog legs and lizard-lion on quite a few menus there.

Â 
The Reeds was a silly point, but there's something to be said for the Boltons and Umbers. Not to mention I think the Skags are technically of the North, even if disconnected from the mainland.Â
1976	Kasporio	2014-04-08	IMO i dont really give a fu.. about the thenns are true to the books. But cannibalism is supposed to be practiced in a ritual way. You eat the heart, or liver, it depends, of a slain ennemy. It's supposed to give the consumer the strength of his lsain foe, and, in a way, to honour the fallen. In the tv, we see the Magnar bragging about how people taste better south of the wall, o my gawd, like it's a freaking all you can eat buffet.
Â 
If thenns are supposed to be the most civilised wildlings, its because they had enough agricultural means and cultivable lands to allow a large population to thrive, which would eventually allow them to unite into one tribe, instead of warring at each others. The fact tv thenns are all cannibals show they're brutish savages, they should carry some bear pelt and wooden clubs....
1977	WTFSalami	2014-04-08	These aren't ALL the Thenns that we see in this episode though, it's just a small group of them.
1978	Kasporio	2014-04-08	Ok, just saying the tv show depicts the free folk as barely able to cross the wall and invade Westeros. In the books, its made clear wildling raiders often cross the wall, Jarl, while not twenty, crossed the wall with the weeper in the past.
They know how many NW garrisons are still active, and roughly, how many black brothers will defend it.Â 
Â 
In season 3, they was very unsure of it, while in the books, they were able to tell Jon was lying by overestimated the watch manpower.
So, the scenarists just dont bother, or its to make clear to the viewer who never read the book... hey, wildlings are douchebags, you're expecting an homeric battle with 300 hundred mamoth, 50000 raiders against hundreds of cooks and stewards?
May not happen. The watch will win anyway cuz...WL are creepy....
1979	The Old Tongue	2014-04-08	Â 
Agreed. There's still plenty of time to further the dynamic of the wildlings throughout the season, especially if Jon does go over to "negotiate" with Mance.

And then we'll see if the show will feature Val.

Â 
This exactly. No one cares about the Thenns. They barely have a presence in the books to begin with.
1981	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-08	I'm not bothered, as long as too much cannibalism prior to certain pies...doesn't take away from the impact of said pies!Â
1982	IlAovatar	2014-04-08	I don't like the change. It seems like the show producers are trying too hard to have clearly identifiable (bald) evil baddies in the upcoming battle.
Â 
What makes the wildlings interesting is the fact that they're not just a bunch of evil savages trying to get beyond the Wall so they can eat people. The audience is supposed to be a bit unsure who to root for.
Â 

Â 
I feel like sometimes people just make up things to get upset about because they see something that's different than the novels and then have to retroactively go back to find a reason to be offended by it.

I disagree. If book fans get upset about any kind of change, then why is Tywin Lannister widely regarded as one of the best portayals in the TV adaptation? Charles Dance doesn't really look like book Tywin at all, and he sure as hell doesn't spend time with Arya in Harrenhal.
Â 
Book fans can accept and even appreciate significant changes when they make sense and actually improve upon the books. Turning the Thenns into evil cannibals doesn't improve anything. It just seems like some network executive in a suit has presented a bunch of pie charts and said that ratings will be higher if there are some obvious baddies involved in the Battle of Castle Black, because audiences are so stupid that they get all flustered and angry when they don't know who to root for.
1983	dtones520	2014-04-08	I think it's mostly that they wanted to show how different Wildling clans are. Most of the Wildlings we have seen so far are relatively normal people who are just more hardened from living in shitty conditions for their whole lives. We know there are tons of different Wildlings out there from the Hornfoots to the Thenns and certain clans are much more savage than the others. The Thenns are tv viewers avenue to the savagery of some of the Wildling clans. 
And just because they are portrayed as cannibals doesn't mean they can't have a structured society with laws and a Lord/god. It just means you eat your enemy.

There are Wildlings they can root for in Tormund and Ygritte and Mance. There are some pretty awful Wildlings in the books too that no one would root for, the Weeper and Lord of Bones for example.

I don't often have problems with changes at all I just felt the Thenns, especially later on in the story, are one the most important Wildling groups. They are the first house "accepted" into the north and made a noble house, and this is mainly because of their advanced culture over the other Wildlings (historically similar to the Gaul of Roman times). 
By making the Thenn mindless cannibals (there's no way to make cannibals seem okay in anyway) either the whole Wildlings joining the North and House Thenn thing gets dropped (which I see as really sad) or they replace them with another Wildling clan that is more modern, but if they did that why not just make the guys we just met a different tribe and keep the Thenn for that later intro. It just seemed like an unnecessary change that didn't really add much besides some kind of tribal islander looking guys.

I don't see any reason why they would they make Alys marry Thenn. I also don't see why would they cast Alys, but they are obviously including Thenns, then why not Alys.

They wanted the attack on the Wall to include Wildlings who were formidable, scary warriors and who had a bit of savagery to them.
Â 
All this garbage about how the Thenns were "accepted" by Jon because of their advanced culture is some serious extrapolation and it sure as hell isn't going to be something that the show deals with.

They included the Thenns so they could provide an element of danger to the battle in E9. Based on the decisions they've made in the past around consolidating characters and storylines, I will be absolutely shocked if they bother with anything after that.Â  Your first hint is that they didn't bother casting Sigorn, only Styr (who's going to be killed).

Good thing we have the books to go back and read for all that stuff, and it will always be there no matter what happens on the show.
1991	Hippocras	2014-04-09	Just because book Thenns have laws and lords does not mean they are not brutal and maybe even also cannibals. We really don't know very much about them. But it is a mistake to assume they are nice guys just because they have some organization and technology.
The change really ain't a big deal in my view. If you didn't like their lines, fine, but the writing quality is a different issue from the choice to introduce them as cannibals. For that, I can understand what the show is trying to do. They are trying to boost the drama of the battle of the wall with some real serious nasty guys to fight. They are also introducing canibalism, which IS an actual theme in the books which may be eventually important, and they are trying to do this while vastly reducing the number of characters they need to write and actors they need to hire from the book version.
The Thenns in the books are the ones who make the most trouble for Jon after they pass south of the Wall. So it makes sense to show them as nasty now.
1992	We Swore A Vow	2014-04-09	On asoiaf wiki it mentions that magnar is the name of a vassal house on skagos. The title magnar is held by a then the leader iirc.
1993	paddington	2014-04-09	Not a lot of meat on a forearm.Â Â  Going to be a lot of dissappointed cannibals, if all thats brought back is an arm.Â Â  Should have taken a leg.
1994	Nobody of the canals	2014-04-09	On asoiaf wiki it mentions that magnar is the name of a vassal house on skagos. The title magnar is held by a then the leader iirc.


Â 
That's true. There seems to be a House Magnar from Skagos, that could have been the inspiration for this change.
So far we've only heard rumors that the Skagosi are cannibals - no one actually confirms it. So it could very well be untrue. Either way, the Magnar in the show was slightly caricaturish with very obvious lines - it sort of reinforces my impression that the original writing in the show isn't particularly great. I also wonder about the logistics of feeding the whole Thenn crowd traveling with the Wildling force north of the wall.
I've been re-reading ASoS in bits for a while, and maybe I'm forgetting something, but Styr in the books seems like an average jerk, who, while not being particularly kind or nice, doesn't seem evil either. His attitude towards Jon, at least, is by all means, justifiable.Â
1995	jet199	2014-04-09	Northern cannibalism has always bothered me anyway. Cannibalism does tend to have a ritual aspect but it is also far more common in cultures where there are not a lot of protein sources in the environment. In an icy northern climate there is far more protein available than vegetation so the likelihood of a cannibalistic culture is low. I think GRRM just used cannibalism to equal savage just like he made the giants vegetarian to try to paint them as big, hairy hippies. Can you imagine the amount of calories you would expend to get a few roots out of the hard frozen ground, it is far more sensible to just eat a deer, no wonder the giants are going extinct.
Â 
The Thenns as cannibals makes more sense than the other wildling tribes, if they can grow some plants but maybe have hunted out their valley or driven animals out to protect their crops. Â I know it screws some things up with the plot (and Jon's positive appraisal of his own actions in his POVs which we should be suspicious of anyway considering how those POVs ended) but I can't really hate the change.

Â 
Once we admit that they changed it, it's useless to compare the Thenns of the show from those of the books. Whether they are a good introduction is subjective. To me, they might serve the purpose of increasing the threat to Castle Black well.
1997	Nobody of the canals	2014-04-09	I agree - the change itself is fine, after all wildlings like the Weeper are shit scary. But the writing could have been a little less over the top, I think. The way he was introduced, it was like he had the evulz plastered all over him, and all through the conversation, he kept dropping very unsubtle hints about the cannibalism and then, big surprise, a human arm. I feel like there should be better ways of introducing creepy characters in a subtler way - in fact I would have been more shocked and scared if they'd the gone the way of treating the Magnar like, well, a normal jackass, who, oh btw, ate humans. But I don't know, maybe there wasn't enough time.
1998	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-09	The cannibalism thing wasn't meant to be a surprise or subtle. These guys are anything but subtle. The point of the scene was to establish the Thenns as hard, brutal, monstrous motherfuckers and it worked.
1999	Zar Lannister	2014-04-09	When I saw the Thenns, all I could think of was "Poor Alys Karstark."LOL. This was also my first reaction. But then I really thought that Alys is probably unnecessary for the show. I've learned to accept there are some details that wouldn't translate well into the TV-episodes (or would just seem to unrealistic)... and from a financial standpoint, I think adding additional characters that aren't so active plot wise would increase costs way too much.So I guess I'm cool with the change in the Thenns and presenting the Free Folk as a group of people who are as diverse as it comes and helps people understand some of the dangers lying North of the Wall (because as far as we know, all that the TV viewers have seen is the dangers South of the Wall).EDIT: Clarity

I've learned to accept there are some details that wouldn't translate well into the TV-episodes (or would just seem to unrealistic)... and from a financial standpoint, I think adding additional characters that aren't so active plot wise would increase costs way too much.
So I guess I'm cool with the change in the Thenns and presenting the Free Folk as a group of people who are as diverse as it comes and helps people understand some of the dangers lying North of the Wall (because as far as we know, all that the TV viewers have seen is the dangers South of the Wall).
EDIT: Clarity


Â 
100% agree
2001	Lord Spark of House Spark	2014-04-09	I don't like the change. It seems like the show producers are trying too hard to have clearly identifiable (bald) evil baddies in the upcoming battle.
Â 
What makes the wildlings interesting is the fact that they're not just a bunch of evil savages trying to get beyond the Wall so they can eat people. The audience is supposed to be a bit unsure who to root for.
Â 
I disagree. If book fans get upset about any kind of change, then why is Tywin Lannister widely regarded as one of the best portayals in the TV adaptation? Charles Dance doesn't really look like book Tywin at all, and he sure as hell doesn't spend time with Arya in Harrenhal.
Â 
Book fans can accept and even appreciate significant changes when they make sense and actually improve upon the books. Turning the Thenns into evil cannibals doesn't improve anything. It just seems like some network executive in a suit has presented a bunch of pie charts and said that ratings will be higher if there are some obvious baddies involved in the Battle of Castle Black, because audiences are so stupid that they get all flustered and angry when they don't know who to root for.


 Â This.
Â 
It's not so much that the Thenns are being portrayed as cannibals, it's more that it was done in such a heavy handed, clumsy manner.
2002	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-09	Now there needs to be subtlety in the way a group of savage, cannibalistic Thenn's are introduced? Because, the fact of the matter is, whatever the Thenn's are or aren't in the novels is kind of irrelevant to the television show. It's the kind of tangential detail that can easily be changed, because the far-reaching effects are minimum, and it allows the writers to display a different aspect of the wildlings' culture.
Â 
Orell was kind of an asshole, but all things considered, he wasn't so bad. Tormund is downright amiable, if intimidating, and Mance comes across as both reasonable and respectable (in the short amount of time we've spent with the character). The wildling camp was full of women and children, and their goal is one that the audience can easily identify with (get south by whatever means necessary in order to avoid becoming another solider in an undead army), as well.
Â 
Then there's Ygritte, a pretty major character (who has been around since the middle of the second season), and one that the majority of the viewers seem to have a positive response to. So this idea that the writers haven't already made the battle similar to Blackwater, in terms of moral ambiguity, seems disingenuous. The audience already has 'good guys' to root for on both sides, and now (with the addition of the Thenn's, and the return of Slynt & Thorne) they have 'bad guys' on both sides of the battle.Â 
Â 
Finding the scene overwrought is one thing, though I would disagree that it wasn't an effective introduction to those characters, but saying that the scene is being used to more clearly delineate the 'good guys' from the 'bad guys' doesn't seem like a valid complaint, considering it's actually evening the scales.Â
2003	WTFSalami	2014-04-09	Agreed with all of that. Not to mention, the soundtrack during their introduction was just so awesome. I love Ramin Djawadi. His music is one of the main characters of this show. He's so good at capturing the different histories and tones of houses, as well as different situations. 
Most everybody has a theme in this show that is so appropriate to them and their story.
2004	TheWanderer	2014-04-09	It's not so much that the Thenns are being portrayed as cannibals, it's more that it was done in such a heavy handed, clumsy manner.


Â 
IDK about clumsy but I think heavy handed is the way to go for this scene (and introductions in general). If you're too subtle than people's impression is going to be "Okay, so Tormund's got some more guys, guess that will mean trouble for Jon, and they're called Thens or something? Look a little weird." and they're going to completely forget about them. But Styr's heavy-handedness means people finished that scene and thought nothing other than "Those Thenns are crazy man, I feel real worried about Jon's safety now."
Â 
Plus, I get the impression that Styr was deliberately hamming it up. Remember he's not just introducing himself to us but also introducing (and reintroducing) himself to Tormund and his crew. Styr wants to be the boss and the best way for him to be the boss is to remind everyone that you do not f*ck with the Thenns. (And I seriously feel like his entire monologue could've been delivered like that Lonely Island song and it would've worked perfectly: "Got an owl, Like A Boss! Took a detour, Like A Boss! Ate a fatty, Like A Boss! Threaten Ygritte, Like A Boss! Try some crow, LIKE A BOSS!")

So the Thenns are a little different, they like to eat other people, its not like they are hypocrites or keep it secret, they are hospitable and willing to share. The thing that got me is why are they all bald, most people who live some place that's really cold wear hats and grow beards, so they are like the skinhead brigade of the wildlings. I wonder if there women are bald?
2006	TheSpottedCat	2014-04-09	Yes, it did bother me a lot, and yes, I think it will have ramifications for the wildling storyline in ADWD. But, I guess they might give the Thenns' role to another tribe, or have Sigorn belong to another tribe.
2007	TheWanderer	2014-04-09	The thing that got me is why are they all bald, most people who live some place that's really cold wear hats and grow beards, so they are like the skinhead brigade of the wildlings. I wonder if there women are bald?


Â 
While I agree that being bald probably isn't super practical (it's not really a big deal though cause you know, hats and hoods) I do like the way it gives the Thenns a very unified look. That's one of the biggest things about the Thenns in the novels, they are very well organized and disciplined and I think having them all have the same hair and scars makes them come across less like a marauding band of savages and more like an army (of savages). Helps make them threatening. Plus it looked cool.
2008	marsyao	2014-04-10	I think they're not cannibals. They were trying to mock them because they got Jon with them before.


Â 
These Thenn are cannibals in the TV show, didn't you see the human arm roasting on the fire?

Â 
I agree, I thought it was a nice touch as well. Also I know Styr in the books is described as bald and clean shaven, and I don't believe he wears a hat. It just kind of shows how the Wildlings are tougher and more suited to that climate (and thus more prepared for the winter).
2010	Fevre River Warrior	2014-04-10	I think they are combining the Thenns with the cannibals from Skagos in the story. It makes me wonder where little Rickon will end up.......since the books hint at Skagos but the show says the Last Hearth.
2011	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-10	^ Something tells me we'll be seeing the Greatjon again, possibly with a short scene in this coming season, but more likely some time next season. They didn't choose to send Osha & Rickon to the Last Hearth for no reason, and I can see the Umber's (through Greatjon) and the Manderly's (through Wyman Manderly) representing the northern rebellion in the fifth season.Â
2012	Lady of Long Lake	2014-04-10	I loved everything about that scene but wish it was any other sub-culture group in the Wildlings. The Thenns are the closest thing to nobility North of the Wall and they've turned them into monsters:( Albeit, very-cool looking monsters.
2013	shiola	2014-04-10	I've only read the first few pages of this discussion, but in regard to the cannibalism.. Â Eh, I didn't like it much. Â But, having the Thenns and Ygritte/Tormund on the same side gives a good amount of confliction for the viewer. Â It goes with the Jorah line in the previews-- "It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, but there is good and evil on both sides of every war ever fought" or whatever he says.
Â 
Becasue of the Thenns, the Battle of the Wall will be like the Battle of Blackwater, in a sense. Â With Blackwater, we were rooting against Joffrey... Â But if KL fell, Sansa and Tyrion were in grave danger. Â Just like with the Wall, we root for Jon, but hate Janos; and if Jon wins, the Thenns are gone, but then Tormund/Ygritte are in danger. Â So I like having all of that going into a battle.

2014	Widows_Blood	2014-04-10	I don't mind that they added cannibalism to their culture, but the way it was introduced was about the least subtle way you could have introduced it.


How do you subtly introduce cannibalism in like a 5 min scene?Â 
Â 
And why do people keep acting like there aren't wildling cannibals. Thenns are clearly an amalgamation of the Ice River Clans.Â
2015	Isildur's Mane	2014-04-10	While they look very impressive, I'm not sure what I think about the changes yet. I'm note sure how it is going to work moving forward to the next seasons.
2016	Clariana	2014-04-11	Anyone notice that Styr was modeled on the Persian King in 300, even had that kinky, loose hipped walk...

2018	adiman83	2014-04-11	I don't know if this was mentioned before, but I think the only reason they made the Thenns like that is to let the viewers know (non-book reading viewers I mean) how much more dangerous they were compared to the other wildlings. In the books they had laws, discipline and could forge their own weapons and armor which made them a lot more dangerous than regular wildlings. It would've been a lot more difficult and expensive to actually show their society.
Â 
BTW, does anybody know the name of the song they used to introduce them?

Â 
Nah, but it will most likely be on the soundtrack when its released. Ramin Djawadi is killing it again; Oberyn's theme is just as awesome.

The reason they didn't make up a new clan is simple.  Why make up a new one with totally new characters when you can use an existing clan with characters that have already been created and just alter them to your preference?  It's not like the Thenns were especially important in the books.
The only real difference between the Thenns and the ice river clans (dietary beliefs aside) is that we see the Thenns in the books and they have a simpler, better name.
2022	Jaqen Hghar	2014-04-23	I feel that I just have to mention that I actually had Crow for dinner last night ;-). I'd post a picture of the plateÂ but it doesn't seem like you can upload them here, right? Odd as it may sound, but in spring young crows are commonly hunted in Sweden, and one restaurant has a tradition of serving Spring Crow during a couple of weeks. Apparently it's best if winter's been rather harsh so they're not too fat which may make them taste a bit oily. It's a dark meat that had a taste and texture somewhat between game and liver (if that makes any sense...).

Â 
Now you've piqued my interest.Â 
Â 
There's a graveyard about a kilometer from where I live. Quite a few crows can be seen there, no doubt drawn by the pungent aroma of decomposing flesh. Maybe I could catch and try one.Â

2024	Jaqen Hghar	2014-04-23	Why not? They're pretty large birds after all, similar in size with a grouse at least, and you basically cut out the breast filets and cook them. We had them somehow braised in some kind of sauce, served cut in slices on top of sautered cabbage with potato croquettes and also with a small sausage which according to the waitress contained crow meat, crow fat and some reindeer meat. All in all a nice combination,Â thoughÂ perhaps a bit over-priced but being a speciality very limited in time and availability you just have to live with that...

Â 
Swedish crows must be slower and far less wary of humans than Australian's crows and ravens. Here they are notoriously difficult to hunt.
2026	Jaqen Hghar	2014-04-23	Swedish crows are just as wary and clever and just as difficult to hunt. The crows hunted are commonly young ones, hunted in early spring or late winter, typically March/April. What you do is take advantage of their habit of bullying predators like owls; you put up a plastic owl in a tree for instance and wait for the crows to attack it, well camouflaged and shotgun ready
2027	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-10	A GoT podcast I listen to ("A Cast of Kings") had a lively discussion at the end about the closing credit music.
Â 
One of the hosts has not read the books and found the closing music after Arya scene to be a little disturbing. He said he felt it to be 'too triumphant' given that he had just seen a little girl transform into a killer. The closing music was the GoT theme and he felt it was just too 'upbeat'.
Â 
I would have thought that as this was 'a StarkÂ finallyÂ fights back' moment that it was justified.Â 
Â 
In the comment someone posted that, the closing music changes during the credits.... I hadn't bothered letting it roll that far on previous watches so I missed it.
Â 
Right towards the end, the music changes from the GoT theme... to what is apparently Jaqen H'ghar's theme.

2031	stunningsteve	2014-04-07	Just rewatched the scene with the white book and looked closely at the text we can see.
Joff ist talking about Dayne,Dunk and Jaime, but we also get a look at someone elses second(?) page left to Daynes. It can be concluded that this person is Gerold Hightower.

Â 
...while defending the honour and property of the Dornish princess, Elia Martell. Handed command to Ser Arthur Dayne due to sustained injuries the same year. Broke three lances against Oswell Whent in the Tourney at Harrenhal and fought with great distinction the melee.
Dispatched by King Aerys to locate the crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen in the wake of Robert Baratheons rebellion. Died in the Red Mountains of Dorne alongside his sworn brothers Ser Arthur Dayne and Ser Oswell Whent. After refusing to bow a knee to the new King, Robert Baratheon, all three were defeated by a small force led by Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell.

Â Screenshot: https://www.dropbox....07 16.25.36.png
I wonder if the beginning is somehow related to the Kingswood Brotherhood or something different. ToJ reference, but no surprise that Lyanna is not mentioned.
Â 
Arthur Daynes first page:

Â 
Second Son (of) Beric Dayne of the House Starfall. Named "Sword of the Morning" and wielder of the great white blade "Dawn", forged from a fallen star.
Won many tourneys and broke twelve lances against Rhaegar Targary(en), Prince of Dragonstone at the Tourney of Storm's End. In the year of the False Spring, at the Great Tourney at Harrenhal, he stood against all but the prince once more.
Beloved by the people, he acted as their voice in the reign of Aerys II, gathering their concerns and bringing them before the King. Brought in laws for the royal forces to repay the smallfolk for their goods and turned the tide of support against the criminal scourge of the Kingswood Brotherhood. Let the Kingsguard to victory...

Â Screenshot: https://www.dropbox....07 16.28.14.png
For some reason the page has a few "typos" ( first sentence is missing an "of" and Rhaegar has the last name "Targary"). The second half is rather interesting.
Â 
At last we got a very good look at Jaimes Page:

Â 
Squired for Barristan Selmy against the Kingswood Outlaws. Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his sixteenth year for valor in the field. At the Sack of King's Landing murdered his king, Aerys the second, at the foot of the Iron Throne.
Pardoned by King Robert Baratheon. Thereafter known as Kingslayer.

The squire thingie for Barristan is quite an interesting change and potential build-up for their reunion at some point down the road.

Â 
Ulmer, stooped and grey-bearded and loose of skin and limb, stepped to the mark and pulled an arrow from the quiver at his waist. In his youth he had been an outlaw, a member of the infamous Kingswood Brotherhood. He claimed heâ<U+0080><U+0099>d once put an arrow through the hand of the White Bull of the Kingsguard to steal a kiss from the lips of a Dornish princess. He had stolen her jewels too, and a chest of golden dragons, but it was the kiss he liked to boast of in his cups.
2034	WTFSalami	2014-04-08	Not to give the guy any more reasons to get sidetracked, but The White Book would be something that I'd love to see one day. It'd be so cool to see illustrations of these guys and all their histories.

Don't forget you can't erase and you don't become Commander of the Kingsguard with years of experience in a scriptorium.Â  It seems unlikely that either Barristan or Jaime has used the ability to write much beyond sending military reports, and even then many of them would have been dictated.

It would have been Barristan who wrote the Hightower and Dayne entries (hence no mention of Lyanna...how would he have known), so mayhaps ol' Barristan the Bold was not such a scholar.

2046	Fool of a Book	2014-04-08	Aside from the other aspects of the story that might change because of Jaime and Brienne's early arrival in KL, I had a huge issue with Brienne's lecture to Jaime. Â IMO this is the biggest show v. book change that caused the most problems.
Â 
Brienne was sworn with finding CS's girls, along with Jaime. Â Yet, she doesn't introduce herself to Sansa? Â Tell Sansa she was sworn to her mother, and will swear herself to Sansa's protection now and try to find Arya? Â She could easily have done this without giving Jaime a hard time.
Â 
Sorry, I found it really out of character for Brienne to dress down Jaime, while she herself was the one sworn to Cat.
Â 
Maybe we'll see something in a future episode, but the Brienne I know would have sought out Sansa immediately and shared her story. Â I'm sure Sansa would LOVE to know how much her mother risked to try and save her.
Â 
She would have had some joy that Sansa was safe and alive, and shed a tear with Sansa over Cat's death. Â The Brienne I know would have sworn herself to Lady Sansa and not left her side.
Â 
Instead, she sought out Marg, to swear vengeance against Stannis re: Renly? Â Come on Brienne, Arya is still missing, and your oath to Cat still isn't over. Â She swore no oath to avenge Renly. Â That scene was pretty much useless.
Â 
... and all this is probably why GRRM didn't have her arrive earlier in KL.
Â 
Her interaction with Jaime just seemed like plot-filler for me to excuse Jaime's non-actions. Â But to make Brienne act out of character just because they changed the timing of some events of the plot really rubbed me the wrong way. Â

There of course is another episode since I wrote this, and my opinions haven't changed because Brienne still paid no attention or homage or respects to Sansa.


Â 
Someone pointed out in another thread that one of the big issues they had was that Brienne has now pretty much had conversations with pretty much everyone in KL - except the two people who were most important: Sansa and Loras. I love Brienne and quite liked here moment with Cersei, but when she walks up to the high table at the wedding - well, that just stuck out like a sore thumb that it shouldn't be there.

It's entirely appropriate that Lady Brienne, as the apparent representative of her Lord Father, approach the dais and pay homage to the King (likely House Tarth has yet to do so in person) and new Queen.Â  She knows her duty and would do it.
Â 
It also seems very likely to me that Jaime would have recounted the events since he was captured and that Brienne was sworn to return Sansa to Catelyn would be a key detail in that story...safe to say Tywin would not let her contact super-valuable Sansa Lannister, heir to Winterfell, and carry her off.

Â 
It would be even more appropriate if the representative of the Lord Paramount of Dorne approached the High Table ahead of a lesser lordship like Tarth. The fact that Tarth was theÂ only one to do it is why the scene stood out like a sore thumb.
2052	Talking Hodor	2014-04-15	I don't think the Lannisters let just anybody have access to Sansa. By now they probably know why she was escorting Jamie.Â  That could be why she hasn't visited her.Â  Or she's simply shy.Â  Brienne's not very outgoing.

Excellent point.

Well, that was the problem. Â Having Brienne arrive *early* in KL and just hang around (ostensibly just for face-time for the actress) created a lot of issues and questions, and did NOT serve her character well.... or anyone else's for that matter.
Â 
ETA early

2055	Fat Trell	2014-04-15	Brienne and Jaime's reaction to Sansa does a disservice to both characters. Brienne should have at the least attempted to swear herself to Sansa. Jaime might have decided that Sansa was safest in KL, but he should have discussed bothÂ this and his oathsÂ with Tyrion or Sansa.
Â 
Instead of this we get to see Brienne wander around the capital, talking to all the TyrellsÂ except the one she needed to. All of whom seem to love her for absolutely no reason beside allowing Olenna to make fun of her male relations, again.
2056	TheKingoftheSevenKingdoms	2014-04-07	Thank god Ser Arthur Dayne was mentioned. He's an awesome enigmatic character in the books that we don't know about. I wish they had spent more time with him thought. Jaime has quite a history Â with this guy. He respect and admires the Sword of Morning.
Â 
It could have gone like.Â 
Â 
"Led the attack on the Kingswood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat." Joffrey.
Â 
"I know. I was there. Ser Arthur was the one who knighted me." Jaime.
Â 
Joffrey insults Ser Arthur, and Jaime almost bitchslaps him.Â
2057	King Behind The Wall	2014-04-08	Tower Of Joy exposition is coming! Whatever happened there is pivotal to the end result so it is inevitable to show it on screen somehow. It would be interesting to see how they show it. We didn't have the dream in season 1 and they are not doing flashbacks. Any ideas on how they are going to do it?
2058	ovis alba	2014-04-08	I already said so in the promo thread of the next episodes: My bets are on a certain person that is quiet ahead in his own story and might serve as a tool to bring in some of the historical stuff, that was skipped so far in the Tv show, but will most likely be of big importance.
2059	Duke O' Nooobs	2014-04-08	I tried to start a thread about this yesterday but it didn't go through I guess....
Did anyone pause the tv and try to read the book? I did
2060	Rhaquentis	2014-04-08	I love all these little nods to the book readers in the show. Respect
2061	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-08	Liked that they gave him a mention, showing they've not completely forgotten about House Dayne since it could potentially be important in the long run.
2062	Khal Shaggydog	2014-04-08	Joffrey is so freaking hopped up all the time I'm surprised he ever learned how to read. Â Seriously, the kid looks like he is on speed in every scene now, all jittery and jumpy.
Â 
Definitely need some Tyrion slapping pretty soon.
2063	King Behind The Wall	2014-04-08	Tower Of Joy will be mentioned on the show very soon one can hope. There is no point in mentioning Arthur Dayne now and showing TOJ sequence two seasons later. Non-readers are not going to remember that long.
2064	HelenaExMachina	2014-04-08	I was more impressed with 
	Spoiler  Dunk the Lunk namedrop  Although it irked me that they had his entry after Arthur Daynes, since he should have been before
2065	Chebyshov	2014-04-08	Tower Of Joy will be mentioned on the show very soon one can hope. There is no point in mentioning Arthur Dayne now and showing TOJ sequence two seasons later. Non-readers are not going to remember that long.


Â 
Not to mention the page to the left of Dayne's page was "Gerold Hightower"
2066	GHOSTSTARK	2014-04-08	& Ser Duncan the Tall had 4 pages. he mustve been some man
2067	Ser Oromus Locke	2014-04-08	All this, Oberyn's hint that Rhaegar left Elia for "another woman which caused a war" and Daario2.0 giving Dany a dusk rose.. Hmmmm..
Â 
Definitely a lot - and I mean a lot - of backstory/hint-dropping in the first episode of a new season.
2068	Chebyshov	2014-04-08	All this, Oberyn's hint that Rhaegar left Elia for "another woman which caused a war" and Daario2.0 giving Dany a dusk rose.. Hmmmm..

Definitely a lot - and I mean a lot - of backstory/hint-dropping in the first episode of a new season.


Â 
I'll be surprised if we don't get 
	Spoiler  Barristan's "Rhaegar loved his lady Lyanna" line this season
2069	MikeMartell	2014-04-08	I've heard people say Daario is Rhaegar. If Daario was Rhaegar, wouldn't Barristan recognise him? Haha.
2070	Slayer of Lies	2014-04-08	Not to mention the page to the left of Dayne's page was "Gerold Hightower"


I noticed that too... Â It's Hightower's last page, and tells of his death at the hands of Ned and a "small force." Â So close! Â No direct mention of ToJ though.
Â 
Also caught specific mention of 'Dawn' on Dayne's page, which is a potentially positive sign for the Dawn=LB theory.
Â 
But, of course, all of these white book Easter eggs (Arthur, Dawn, Aerys sending Hightower to search for Rhaegar in Dorne) all need a little more follow up in the script to solidify them as important elements of the show plot.
2071	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-08	Tower Of Joy exposition is coming!That's exactly what I thought.Â Â Did anyone pause the tv and try to read the book? I did There are screencaps in another thread. It basically says he was son of some "Beric Dayne", a second son, he owned Dawn and mostly of his awesome stuff he did.
2072	King Behind The Wall	2014-04-09	I already said so in the promo thread of the next episodes: My bets are on a certain person that is quiet ahead in his own story and might serve as a tool to bring in some of the historical stuff, that was skipped so far in the Tv show, but will most likely be of big importance.


Â 
That's the tricky part. There are no weirwoods near ToJ as far as we know (unless i missed something). So is there a chance that the Reeds will tell him anything about this?
Â 
Furthermore, will they go all the way during the ToJ exposition or will they show only the stuff readers already know, i.e. equivalent to Ned's dream?
2073	Inv1ctus	2014-04-09	So why didn't they show the dream in the season 1? It was the perfect timing and all. Did they at first decide not to include it at all and have now realised it was a mistake and will somehow try to incorporate it in the story? Or it won't happen at all. Unless Howland is gonna explain it in the 7th season, lol.
2074	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-09	Bran needs to green dream some Rebellion/Tower of Joy scenes pronto.
2075	King Behind The Wall	2014-04-09	So why didn't they show the dream in the season 1? It was the perfect timing and all.

Unless Howland is gonna explain it in the 7th season, lol. 


Â 
This might have been the decision of the show runners because maybe books gave too much information away in that dream. That dream is the primary reason for the prevalent J = R + L theory among readers.Â  So if J = R + L is expected to be a shocking twist on the show later on, ToJ sequence will have be far more subtle, done differently or skipped completely. In the current situation whenÂ J = R + L eventually be revealed, non-readers will be far more surprised/shocked than readers.
2076	Mother of Mountains	2014-04-09	Â 
Â 
So why didn't they show the dream in the season 1?
Â 
The show runners don't want to make the same mistake Martin made, telegraphing R+L=J too early.

Â I tried to start a couple threads that never went through, and then 2 days later I see almost the exact same thread I started, done by someone else. I think the system here for approving threads by moderation is suspect.

Â 
Furthermore, will they go all the way during the ToJ exposition or will they show only the stuff readers already know, i.e. equivalent to Ned's dream?


Â 
Might be he just sees a snippet of Ned or someone else, who is back in Winterfell and who is talking to someone about it. When he then tells the Reeds what he saw, they might guess what it was about and tell him the whole story as they know it?! Or maybe in the show he will not need the weirwoods but other things can serve as a "medium"? Maybe they just invent there was a weirwood at the ToJ? I really have no idea.
Â 
I just have the feeling that they will have to come up with something they can do with Bran without overtaking the books too much and my feeling is that it's gonna be telling those stories that were otherwise tough to incorperate, because let's face it: when in a book you read how someone is telling a story of the past, it's not much different from reading what happens in the present. On screen however someone telling a story is not that impressive if you don't actually show the stuff and I think introducing flashbacks, dream seqences or something in that direction might have overcomplicated the show back then as there is already a lot of complexitiy in the storytelling due to space/location of all the characters. So throwing in another complexity level by spreading it also in time, might have been just too much to start the series of. (I hope someone gets what I mean, it's difficult to explain in english  )
Â 
But I think now that viewers know all the characters better and are more familiar with the overall storyline and setting, it might be a better time to do something like this.
2079	King Behind The Wall	2014-04-10	Is there a remote possibility that they may have shot the ToJ sequence well in advance when Sean Bean was on-board during season 1 shooting?
2080	Chebyshov	2014-04-10	Is there a remote possibility that they may have shot the ToJ sequence well in advance when Sean Bean was on-board during season 1 shooting?
They had shot a few flashbacks about Robert's Rebellion that ended up being cut, I know. I think it was Ned's brother and father dying, though...not too sure. As for what we might get too see, it depends on how strict they're going to be about the location of weirwoods and Bran needing to see through those trees specifically. Obviously there's none in Dorne by the ToJ, but we could get Ned's "let them grow as brothers" line or even possibly the KotLT stuff, but as was mentioned, they could invent some other medium for Bran.

2081	WiDMNDBAMMD	2014-04-13	I thought it was funny that Jamie didn't mention that he was there when Arthur Dayne defeated the Smiling Knight. They talked about the kingswood brotherhood outlaws before twice in the show.Â

Â 
I was expecting Jaime to say something about seeing Dayne defeat the Smiling Knight also. Â And thanks for the reminder about the season one mention of Dunk. Â I hadn't read the Dunk & Egg stories yet so it didn't sink in at the time.
Â 
Seven Gods, I'm going to need another rewatch from season one!
2084	Slayer of Lies	2014-04-13	I was expecting Jaime to say something about seeing Dayne defeat the Smiling Knight also.I may be missing something, but in the books, Jaime squired for Sumner Crakehall and was knighted by Arthur Dayne in the Kingswood after Arthur's defeat of the Smiling Knight.
Yet, in the show, Jaime squired for Barristan, who - in the show and the books - defeated Simon Toyne in the same conflict.
So I think the missing details (at least for me) are (1) who knighted Jaime in the show, (2) did Jaime ride against the Kingswood Brotherhood in the show and, (3) if so, might Barristan have knighted Jaime in the show instead?
The GOT Wiki reveals none of the above, and I can't remember if any of these details have been mentioned in the show... But I wouldn't be surprised if the show has a multitude of unimportant deviations planned where the fake history of major characters is concerned.
2085	Slayer of Lies	2014-04-15	Belatedly, I answered one of my questions, thanks to the White Book excerpt thread.
Â 

Squired for Barristan Selmy against the Kingswood Outlaws. Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his sixteenth year for valor in the field.

Â 
So, Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s show/book differences:
Â 
Book Jaime squired for Crakehall, rode against the Kingswood Brotherhood, sparred with the Smiling Knight, after which Arthur killed the Smiling Knight, after which Jaime was knighted on the field of battle, all at 15 years of age.
Â 
Meanwhile, Show Jaime squired for Barristan and rode against the KB (possibly at 15?), but was reportedly knighted in his 16th year, which would appear to have happened (well?) after the defeat of the KB as a separate event.
Â 
So at least one of my (rhetorical) questions still stands: who knighted show Jaime?Â  Pointing being (as pertains to this thread), if Show Jaime wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t knighted by Arthur on the field of battle, then thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no reason for Show Jaime to say â<U+0080><U+009C>I was thereâ<U+0080><U+009D> when Joff mentions Arthur.Â  Further, show Jaime likely wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have sparred with the Smiling Knight (not being near Arthur during the battle), and was most likely not knighted immediately after the defeat of the KB, having not been remarked in (in the show) as displaying valor in that particular battle (instead, he squired for Barristan).
Â 
Either way, for the show, it probably makes the most sense that Barristan knighted Jaime because the audience knows who Barristan is, where they have no idea who Arthur is.Â  But I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t believe thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s been revealed yet, and I also donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t believe it is of significant importance in the show, which tends to gloss over the â<U+0080><U+009C>minutiaeâ<U+0080><U+009D> (e.g. the typos in the White Book).
Â 
Anyway, I only wanted to follow up on my previous post because I think it makes sense â<U+0080><U+0093> in the show â<U+0080><U+0093> that Jaime wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have cause to speak up when Joff mentions Arthur, because Show Jaime didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t ride to battle against the KB by Arthurâ<U+0080><U+0099>s side, and wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t knighted on the field immediately after.
2086	Lord Damian	2014-04-07	I really loved the backstory footage of Ice and the contemptuous look on Tywin's face as he "dealt" with the wolfskin and explanation of its orgin to Jaime. I think he will be repulsed by it at the wedding as I think Sansa will be more openly outraged wen she sees it than she was in the books. I hope she makes a scene.
2087	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2014-04-08	Who will be repulsed by it other than Sansa?
2088	TheSpottedCat	2014-04-09	I don't think Sansa will make a scene. It would put her in great danger, and she's smart enough to know that. From the previews, I've seen Sansa get a sickened/confused/sad/angry look on her face, but she remains still. I'm guessing the origins of the steel for the sword will come out through Joffrey's shameless boasting.
2089	Lord Damian	2014-04-09	Who will be repulsed by it other than Sansa?


Jaime does not seem to be able to put 2 and 2 together that the sword was "ICE". Jaime is already changing from complete Jerk to semi Jerk and I think it will sicken him about the sword, leading him to do something later with it.
2090	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-09	Yeah, it didn't click. Looking forward to the Oathkeeper scene. It's a milestone for his character.

Â 
I think he was very surprised when Tywin said there was enough for two swords. I dont think hes going to be to shocked when it sinks in. I mean, as far as they are aware, there are no more Stark sons, the Boltons are Wardens of the North and the Direwolves are down and out so theres no need for Ice to go to waste.

He could have saved it for Sansa's child or returned it to her but he didn't he wanted it for his own house. Nothing to do with waste.
2093	DRS	2014-04-12	Considering that the Valerian steal swords have remained with the same house for thousands of years, and blades symbolizing a position or house have had stories told of their return to those heirs, I find the destruction of Ice distasteful
Â 
Case in point is when Arthur Dayne was killed at the Tower of Joy, Eddard Stark returned the great sword called Dawn, that was a family heirloom as well as being a symbol of his office as Sword of the Mourning. Â .Â

Do we know for sure that LS will be appearing in the television adaptation of the books? The fact that she didn't appear before the end of Season 3 has some to speculate about whether she has been excised. I would be sad, because she is one of the characters from the books that I am rooting for!

Â Well, even in the books she didn't appear right after the Red Wedding. She first appeared in an epilogue to book 3. I think the showrunners wanted to leave some time between her death and the appearance of LS so it will be more shocking and profound when we see her again. If she had appeared right away, it wouldn't have been as powerful.

oberyn!
2103	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-06	Shae is very jealous now.....uh oh......what could that mean?????
2104	Trebla	2014-04-06	Besides the Hounds EPIC lines, I loved the better pacing. Less characters and more development. We didn't need to check in with everybody and the episode was better for that.
2105	zJordan	2014-04-06	Oberyn was amazing... not sure if its because I've been deprived of GoT for 10 months but I honestly believed that episode was the best I've ever seen.

								Untagged spoiler reference removed.
2106	Widows_Blood	2014-04-06	Outside the obvious (Oberyn intro and Arya/Hound) I loved the stuff with Jon and the Thenns. Really cool intro for Thenns and Kit absolutely was phenomenal.Â
2107	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-06	I loved the scene where Brienne talks to Marg about Renly, I can feel the girl power in this episode!
Â 
The Thenns -- that scene was pretty powerful. Scary, intimidating, great job by the directors.
Â 
I also really enjoyed the conversation between Oberyn and Tyrion about being the second son. Tyrion realizing, I think, that someone is messing with Shae. Did Varys act of his own accord or is he working with someone, when he's trying to get Shae to leave?
2108	Autumn is Coming	2014-04-06	Brienne's skirt.
2109	Darth Pipes	2014-04-06	I liked seeing the Cersei/Qyburn interaction.Â  You know when Cersei likes someone, he's definitely no good.

2111	Warhawk137	2014-04-06	Excluding Oberyn & Arya/Hound, which everybody and their brother (assuming such person's brother's head is still attached to his body) has already mentioned, the scene with Jon & Aemon laying a verbal smackdown on a couple of insufferable characters was very gratifying.Â  Also, the milepost on the road to Meereen was appropriately grotesque.
2112	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-06	I liked seeing the Cersei/Qyburn interaction.Â  You know when Cersei likes someone, he's definitely no good.
Â 
Also the reference to Ser Duncan the Tall.


Â 

I loved how Jaime automatically jumps to the conclusion that Cersei may have been sleeping with Qyburn. Clever lion he is.
Â 
I agree that Kit was powerful in the scene against Janos and Alliser. I can tell a difference in him this season, I think some great things are in store for Jon's characterization on the show.

That being said I loved the episode, really loved the ending with Arya and the Hound.

I also really loved Sophie Turner. She gets better and better. The Hound probably had his best scene too.Â

2116	shiola	2014-04-06	Thanks for editing :]
2117	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-06	Kit nailed his speech. I think that was more lines than he's ever had.
2118	Baitac	2014-04-06	I liked the quality of the dragons' scene. I expect them to be hokey but they aren't. These people set up Dinklage to receive nominations. They write  Tyrion so incredibly well nuanced. He is a delight to watch. When  Oberyn was telling the story of his sister, you saw the horrible discomfort that Tyrion felt. Excellent.
2119	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-04-06	Kit nailed his speech. I think that was more lines than he's ever had.


Yeah, he's improved his acting a greal deal. I was very impressed after so many weaker moments in past episodes.
2120	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-06	I also liked Arya saying, "My brother gave me that sword." Jon & Arya are my favorite siblings in the books.
2121	Lady Grimshaw	2014-04-06	Brienne, Olenna, and Margaery
2122	sansatyrell	2014-04-06	Brienne, Olenna, and Margaery


Â 
x2 - I loved their interaction. Wish we could get more of Brienne and Margaery talking! And Olenna going on about Brienne was fun
2123	modbelle	2014-04-06	oberyn!arya and hound just trying to get some chicken.Â oberyn!joff letting jaime now how great he was at winning the war while jaime was lazing around in a cell.oberyn!Oh gods this. I love Oberyn so much, and Arya and the Hound scene was so brutal but great. Joff telling the Kingslayer just how wonderful Joff is and all but straight out calling Jaime a failure. All I could think of was what a dumb idea it would be to piss off someone who killed one of the previous kings. The look Jaime gave him...pretty sure Jaime hates his own kid. Probably a good idea for him not to make any more babies with Cersei in the future.
2124	Damp Hair - The Prophet	2014-04-06	Never put Brienne in that outfit again.
Oberyn & his paramour are a great jolt of energy to the show. Â Oberyn is a force. Â Lots of presence.
Joff is insuferable. Â ser Terwyn Mant (sp) is the worst type of thugish "yes man" & I hope Jaime kills him.
Marg's wig (& Dany's for that mater) is off-putting.
Magnar of Thenn is scary intimidating. Â Love the bronze scales. Â Don't love that he isn't missing ears. Â
2125	KalibakCruel	2014-04-06	Oberyn was awesome. I liked the Thenns, and I loved the little time Jon got. It was great.Â
2126	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-06	Yeah, he's improved his acting a greal deal. I was very impressed after so many weaker moments in past episodes.


Nah hes always been good. Ive been telling you lot for two years now, its not Kit's fault. They are simply giving him more and better shit to work with.Â 
Â 
Blue. Rose. That is all. <3Â 
Duncan the Tall name drop.Â 
Oberyn being Oberyn.Â 
Arya avenging Lommy.
Thenns kick ass and eat crows.Â 
Jon being Jon finally. *swoon* on top of Aemon being a badass.Â 
I like New!Daario.Â
2127	jmondrag	2014-04-06	Great first episode to the seasons. The Hound and Arya just trying to get some chickens was great. I'll admit that I was a bit skeptical at first about the casting of Oberyn, but I'm really liking this guy. He steals every scene he is in, absolutely fantastic! The intro with Tywin and the reforging of Ice gave me chills..It was one thing to read about that atrocity, quite another to see it..
2128	Empress In The North	2014-04-06	I couldn't help but feel a bit saddened by some Arya's actions at the Inn as I did in the book, despite the necessity. It just goes to show that she truly is a broken child.
2129	andrew_	2014-04-06	Yeh Duncan the Tall and Sir Arthur Dayne name drop was awesome.
Loved "What the fuck is a Lommy?" & "I fucken hate Thenns".
Â 
The Thenns were awesome, look forward to their upcoming story arc.
Â 
Also that scene in the tavern was awesome, although it is vastly different in the books they did it well nonetheless.
Â 
There was nothing wrong with previous Daario but the new guy is a clear cut better actor.
Â 
Only negative was I couldn't understand everything Ellaria and Oberyn were saying, there accents were slightly too thick, especially Ellaria's.
2130	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-04-06	Dontos' scene was strangely sad for me. When he said he wants his name to have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world I almost shed a tear.
2131	Corvinus	2014-04-06	Arya's lines to Polliver.Â 
Â 
Also, Ser Arthur Dayne and Dunk. For a moment there I thought Joffrey was going to make a nasty joke about The Sword of the Morning title. I would have jumped through the screen and strangled him.

2132	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-06	Slynt was bitchslapped by Maester Aemon. (that was Slynt, right?)
Sam's "I wanted to hate you" (...but I love you...)
Duncan the Tall got 4 pages. FOUR PAGES. Also, the book look printed rather than written by the KG.
Gotta love Elaria. Looks like part of her work? duty? is to run after Oberyn to stop him from doing Oberynish stuff.
Â 
Â 

joff letting jaime now how great he was at winning the war while jaime was lazing around in a cell.

Â 
I actually laughed aloud at that. Specially the first part of the scene when he was looking all divine staring at the ceiling or whatever.
2133	Justin Danford	2014-04-06	The Rhaegar name drop
The Duncan the Tall name drop
Â 
both tickled me in ways few can understand
Â 

	Spoiler I hope they are seeding a later moment when Jamie writes in the bookâ<U+0080><U+0094>possibly leading to some back story regarding Daynes exit.

2135	Scrambled Aegon	2014-04-06	"What the fuck's a Lommy?" -- Had to pause until I regained my composure.
Â 
The location of the scene with the Thenns was really, really beautiful.
Â 
Absolutely everything about the opening scene, dear Lord. Powerful, magnificent, appropriate start to the season. It was perfect.
2136	Kasrith	2014-04-06	Duncan the Tall
2137	Sages	2014-04-06	Kit nailed his speech. I think that was more lines than he's ever had.


Â 
My thoughts exactly. Finally they give Kit some decent lines. The scenes in the north have been the one weak part to me on the show. But I guess with Kit growing his acting resume recently, they decided to give him some good stuff. His scene with with the council was golden. Kit also comes across a little jaded a little tougher, I like that. Jon feels a little more experienced does carry himself with a certain kind of confignce
Â 
The Oberyn character really comes across as a game changer. In the previews I was skeptical. But after his rather lengthy introduction I must say that I'm loving his character. He will make kings landing very interesting during his stay.
Â 
Everytime I see charles dance as tywin I wish he had more screen time he just dominates each and every scene.
Â 
The actor playing joffrey also does a great job. His sneers, quips and facial expressions makes each one of his scenes extremely enjoyable no matter who is on screen with him.
Â 
And of course tyrion is always great.
2138	bobbybuilderton	2014-04-06	Styr was creepy as hell.
I loved how that guy recognized Arya right before she killed him.Â 
Loved THE RED VIPER OF DORNE. Good lord that was an awesome intro. You really get the feeling that he has harbored that anger about his sister for a big part of his life.Â 
Loved that Doran was mentioned.
LOVED IT ALLLLLLL. All of it, I say!
2139	shiola	2014-04-06	Finally was able to see it!!
Â 
- The opening scene having no dialogue.. Â Just Tywin.
- Even though I'd heard it in the promos that I watched a hundred times, I still love Oberyn's "Tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.".
- Pod knowing the sigils! :3
- Aemon being a sassmaester
- Kit's acting! Â I was so pleasantly surprised
- Cersei showing more of her crazy (How dare you get captured! Â I had to sleep with Lancel as a replacement!)
- My beloved Cat getting some positive references
- Maisie's monotone is so good. Â "Can you walk, boy?"
Â 
And of course.. Â "What the fuck's a Lommy?"Â 
I am looking forward to more of The Hound and Arya, if the gods would be so kind.

Â 
Yes, the arrival of the Thenns on screen was a pleasant surprise. The Thenns looked and sounded absolutely menacing! I loved it!Â
2143	Justin Danford	2014-04-06	These talkers are making me thirsty, Jerry.
2144	go joff go	2014-04-06	I loved how there was a simmering tension to every scene.
2145	Scrambled Aegon	2014-04-06	Pleasantly surprised that Oberyn's bisexuality was made very clear and the show didn't senselessly make him straight. I was worried because I think I only saw him with women in the previews.
2146	ellevt	2014-04-06	"The Rains of Castamere" theme playing over Tywin being all... Tywin-y... Gave me shivers! It's like his very own imperial death march!Â 
Â 
(Tywin versus Vader, who would win? I know Tywin wouldn't have left that exhaust port open)Â 
Â 
And, "if any more words come flowing out of that cunt mouth." That's how I feel in the morning before I've had my coffee and people are talking AT meÂ
2147	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-06	Oh my God, I forgot how much I love Margaery and Olenna in the show!Â 
Â 
Thenns eating human was a cool cut
Â 
Aemon, you magnificent old bastard, why don't you let me hate all the Targaryens
2148	lil_z	2014-04-07	By and Far Hound and Arya...I was on edge. By far Arya books or no has been my favorite character, I love her development!
2149	lil_z	2014-04-07	"The Rains of Castamere" theme playing over Tywin being all... Tywin-y... Gave me shivers! It's like his very own imperial death march!Â 
Â 


Oh yea....I love to hate, and hate to love Tywin! I don't know if that is due in part to the quality of acting by Charles Dance, but the character is wonderful!

Â 
Yes, yes, yes. Â I want to go there NOW. Â Right in between those huge rocks. Â It was lovely.
2151	shiola	2014-04-07	I loved how there was a simmering tension to every scene.


Â 
Good way to put it. Â I definitely caught that with a few scenes, but didn't realize til reading your comment that the tension was kind of the unifying point of the episode. Â Can't wait to look for that bit on my next watch!
2152	shiola	2014-04-07	HIS EYES when he said it. You could FEEEEEL the anger.Â 


Â

Yess. Â I was even a bit scared for my life watching it and I know he isn't real.


Â 
My favorite Oberyn micro-moment was the sadistic glee on his face when he stabbed the Lannister man. Dude wants to wade through a sea of Lannister blood!
Â 
Paired with that, Ellaria's mix of sultry and kindliness. Even the way she flirts is more complimentary than teasing. And her quick "Looover, don't go spazzing!" reaction to the song.Â
2154	shiola	2014-04-07	I loved the way Arya and The Hound were talking with their heads poking out of the bushes. Â It just looked so comical. Â A lot funnier than if they were exchanging quips while facing each other.
2155	juanml82	2014-04-07	Oberyn. All of it.
Â 
The Thenns.
Â 
Jon's "trial"
Â 
Arya killing Polliver.
Â 
New Daario is cool.
Â 
Did I mention Oberyn?
2156	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	So...
Â 
Previously on - Really seemed to build tension as you watched it and I loved the reintroduction of Ser Dontos
Intro - Tywin and the sword, no words can be said to describe how powerful it was.
Opening sequence - New locations - Dreadfort (not as 'Dread' as I expected) and Meeren. They changed the pan angle for sweeping across to Essos too
Â 
Jaime + Tywin - Jaime standing up to Tywin was impressive given the dominance of Tywin over his other two children. I can't wait to rewatch their S1 scene together to compare.
Greeting on the road - Pod naming all the sigils was great. The Dorninsh distain drew a smile too.
Oberyn's introduction - Awesome. Real sense of menace. Did laugh at Tyrion declining and Bronn nodding to Oberyn's offer.
Dany - Yep... I'm not normally one to gush about the CGI, but the Drogon scene.... wow.
Sansa/Tyrion - I thought the scene worked quite well. They had to show what was going through Sansa's head and having the conversation with Tyrion worked better than I thought. Tyrion was a prop for Sansa.
Tyrion/Shea - I'll reserve judgement until we can see how it will develop.
Jaime/Cersei - Jaime was great, you could really get the feeling of him being defeated at trying to rebuild his world.
Thenn introduction - Suitably menacing. Great intensity and like the way it has balanced with Oberyn. Also shows the NW can't just welcome Mance with open arms.
Jon - Solid speech and good job of reintroducing Slynt.
Marg/Olenna/Brienne - a filler scene with some great comedy from Olenna. Setting the scene for Brienne trying to find a place of relevance again.
Jaime/Joff - Again, a scene-setter for Jaime to learn about the ways things work since his absence. As others have said - loved the Dayne and Duncan references.
Daario - I like the new guy, I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. I was always under the assumption we weren't supposed to like him. It will make her choices later more justifiable.
Dontos/Sansa - Solid reintroduction, but they are going to have to push that plot along quick smart.
Arya + Sandor - Brilliant on so many fronts...
2157	KalibakCruel	2014-04-07	I didn't mention, during Jon's scene, which was great, when Janos is trying to mock Jon at everything he says, he starts to make fun of him for saying Giants and he stops when he notices Allister doesn't balk at the mention of Giants, kind of like his "oh shit" moment.
2158	Darkbringer	2014-04-07	Oh yea....I love to hate, and hate to love Tywin! I don't know if that is due in part to the quality of acting by Charles Dance, but the character is wonderful!


Charles dance is a serious contender for performance of the series. It will take something big to knock him off. Kit did well though. And the Hound and Polliver absolutely nailed it.Â 
Â 
"Lots of Cunts" - "Har"
2159	Indigocell	2014-04-07	Dontos' scene was strangely sad for me. When he said he wants his name to have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world I almost shed a tear.

2162	Newstar	2014-04-07	It's a little thing, but I loved, loved, loved that moment when Oberyn tilted up Tyrion's chin to force Tyrion to look him in the eye, and Tyrion quickly shoved his hand aside with one finger without breaking eye contact. A lot said with those two gestures: Oberyn's casual, arrogant violation of Tyrion's personal space and forcing a confrontation, and Tyrion quietly and angrily asserted himself even though his role forced him to play nice with Oberyn and prevented him from talking shit.

-Rhaegar, Ser Arthur Dayne and Duncan the Tall being mentioned

-the blue rose (I'm glad this symbol made its way into the show, as I believe that it'll be of much importance later)
-Joffrey's statue (I couldn't stop laughing at it)


Â 
I agree. Then the very next scene was Joffrey standing with the exact same pose. Â
2168	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-07	It's a little thing, but I loved, loved, loved that moment when Oberyn tilted up Tyrion's chin to force Tyrion to look him in the eye, and Tyrion quickly shoved his hand aside with one finger without breaking eye contact.

Â 
Â 
Yeah, the Oberyn scenes were good.
Â 
The Joffrey statue / next bit was funny.
Â 
As for the Arya scenes ... wish it had been "Is there gold in the Village ? ..."
Â 
And also it sounds like Cersei's on the Moon Tea.
2169	SeventySeven	2014-04-07	There were lots of good scenes:
Â 
- Jon's scene with Janos and the others (soooo happy he's back with the nw and sooo looking forward to the rest)
Â 
- Olenna/Brienne, that was probably my favourite made up scene I've seen in a while
Â 
- Joff is always a delight
Â 
- Arya/Hound/Needle, about time that happened, but it was good
2170	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-07	The opening scene was dastardly brilliant - another twist of the knife into Stark supporters. The Rains of Castamere playing over a silent Tywin as he burned the wolf pelt... just as good as the stag skinning scene in Season 1!
Â 
As a music and sound aficionado, I have to say I absolutely adore both the Thenn's and Oberyn's themes. Oberyn's is sultry with a dangerous undertone, like the uncoiling of a viper. The Thenn's booming theme plays like a giant's horn signaling a hunt or raid; striking fear into enemies.
2171	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-07	-Oberyn talking about Elia (I had no idea her name should be pronounced like that)


Â 
El-e-ah. Strange. I always though it was E-lie-ah.
Â 
ScreamingÂ Elllllllllllleeeeeeeeeeaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!!! doesn't have the same kind of power to it.Â 
Â 
The Tavern scene was amazing. Almost as good as Craster's Keep which is my fav scene of all.
Â 
Joffery being all smug because he recognised Arthur Dayne was hilarious. It looked like he just read his deeds quickly to sound smart.Â
2172	Lord Joker Of FunLand	2014-04-07	Man, this episode was great.
Â 
Loved the Oberyn scenes, going to love the Tyrion/Oberyn chemistry this season.Â 
Â 
The Joffrey/Jamie scene may be one of the best yet in the series.Â 
Â 
The Thenns look badass, i like the change to make them more..."evil" considering most people love Ygritte and saw that Tormund liked Jon.
Â 
Arya and Hound, another scene that could be in the top 5 scenes of the series, epic from start to finish.
Â 
Jon (or Kit i should say, really), as everybody has said, is much better. Aemon is back!! Which is always a plus, love love that scene.
Â 
Overall...Great start to the season, i was a bit nervous that i was too excited and would be let down....luckily i was wrong. Â
2173	Debb2	2014-04-07	(Er, is it really ok to use the term "spazzing"Â phoenix??).
Â 
Loved so much about this episode, can't think of one thing I didn't like. A few little thoughts - Jaime navigating his new position, changing relationship between Dany and the dragons, Arya's descent in to murder...
2174	Red Tiger	2014-04-07	oberyn!
arya and hound just trying to get some chicken.Â 
oberyn!
joff letting jaime now how great he was at winning the war while jaime was lazing around in a cell.
oberyn!


This, I know people nitpick about JOff being a prick to Jaime, but pointing out his lack of accomplishments was IMO a very good idea.
Â 
Also Olenna giving Brienne some love.....and the necklace scene.

2179	SM4e	2014-04-07	Overall I must say that I am postively surprised by the acting. Only Emilia Clarke has been as emotionless as always. Especially Kit Harrington (I didn't know he was able to pull a perfomance like this after last season's average acting), Pedro Pascal and Sophie Turner were pure gold.
Â 
The Dontos/Sansa scene actually made me quite sad as well.
Â 
I think I begin to like Ser Alliser in the show as well. Did anyone else notice then return of Bowen Marsh? He was sitting next to Maester Aemon if I recall correctly.
2180	Chuck88	2014-04-07	Agree about the acting. A lot of the actors seem far more comfortable in their roles than previous.Â 

Aside from all the obvious strengths of what was probably the best season premiere, the namedrops of Arthur Dayne and Doran were good to see. The new music is fantastic. The Thenns are all kinds of horrifying and awesome at once. So much to look forward to with the rest of the season.Â
2181	RhaenysBalerion	2014-04-07	-Oberyn
-Ellaria
-Dragons
-Tywin
Â 
They were fucking awesome!!! The teenage dragons are SO adorable!!! They remind me of my dogs, they are so bloody awesome.Â 
Charles Dance rocked it, and Pedro Pascal, holy shit, he was freaking amazing! The best cast ever! He was hot and dangerous and funny and badass and everything Oberyn has to be.Â  
Â 
Another thing I exceedingly enjoyed: NO Littlefinger!Â 
And I very much appreciated that Elia (whose name I pronounce the way it was pronounced on the show) Â and Rhaegar were finally mentioned.Â
2182	Talleyrand	2014-04-07	Slynt laughing when Jon mentioned giants before shutting up when he realised everyone else was deathly serious.
2183	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-07	I enjoyed the new White Book scene. I really like it in the book, but it was nice to get somewhat of a history lesson and accomplishes the same thing pretty much. Joffrey pointing guys like duncan and Author Dayne doing all this stuff and then seeing Jaime has like a paragraph.
2184	Aderyn	2014-04-07	I have way too many favourite moments... But let's name three...
Â 
I loved the beginning, it was very clever and powerful. I love how Tywin is portrayed in the show.
Â 
Oberyn, finally! I knew there was no way I'd be disappointed by him... He is fantastic. Intelligent, deadly, sexy... Well done, Pedro! The brothel scene might turn out to be one of my favourites in the whole season.
Â 
Arya. The second person to completely steal the show. That look on her face in the last scene...
Â 
Honourable mention goes to... Tyrion. He's probably the one I missed most. Also I can't wait to see more interaction between him and Oberyn.
Â 
What a delicious episode.
2185	Darkbringer	2014-04-07	Dat 'sizzle' as Oberyn passes his hand through the candle flame. Hells yeah, what a badass.
2186	Lord_Baelish	2014-04-07	I stayed up until 3AM to watch this and I wasn't disappointed. I really enjoyed just about every second.
Â 
In particular, I liked the Jon trial and the way everyone pretty much ignored Janos Slynt.Â 
Â 
Oberyn was as class as I expected. His interactions with Tyrion should make some great television.
Â 
And Arya and Sandor continue to be the best double act on the show.
Â 

	Spoiler I kind of want them to skip the Arya in Braavos part and just have her travel with the Hound instead.

2187	Blutrabe	2014-04-07	The guy who was sitting next to Maester Aemon and helping him down the steps - wasn't that "Bowen Marsh" from season 1? It's an awesome little detail that they got the actor back. I hope he'll have a speaking role.

2189	Miss_Targ	2014-04-07	The reforging of Ice as the opening, and the music in the scene gave me chills. It was perfect. Loved Jon talking about Robb, and being back with Sam. Loved watching him being strong while defending himself! Of course, everything with Arya and the hound was fantastic!
2190	Roose Seal	2014-04-07	The cold open was fantastic that's for sure.Â
2191	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-07	Everything!
Â 
I thought this was an excellent season premiere. I love the character development. I LOVED seeing Jaime and Joffrey interact and the little touches, like the Joffrey over the wolf statute.
Â 
The opening scene with the sword was great even though it angered me. Â 
Â 
I loved everything about the introduction of Prince Oberyn.
Â 
Of course, Arya and the Hound stole the show.
Â 
But I also enjoyed all of the Lannister stuff, the way that Tywin and Cersei are now starting to treat Jaime the way they have treated Tyrion. Â Lady Olenna tossing the necklace and even Margaery's little comment about the kind of necklace Joffrey would give her was a nice insight into her mind and feelings toward him.
Â 
One of the other simple things I enjoyed was Brienne's outfit in King's Landing - it was perfect for her in every way. Â I also really enjoyed Sansa's line to Tyrion about why she goes to the Godswood and that we got to see that she is aware she is being watched. Â I hope they start doing more of that to show that Sansa is much smarter than they have previously portrayed her.
Â 
Also, the Thenns were interesting and I liked how they show Jon standing up for himself and not backing down with thorne and Slynt. Â 
Â 
I don't really have any comments about Danaerys except that the dragons looked really good.

2194	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	Â 
Call forward to Quentyn methinks.Â 
Â 


Â 
Yep - that was one of a number of things the image was loaded with... Quentyn, Oberyn about to play with fire, Dornish hot-bloods, the list goes on. It really struck me when it was first shown in the trailer. Adding the 'sizzle' sound FX just gave it more bight.
2195	Red Tiger	2014-04-07	The mention of Arthur Dayne. I fist pumped


Damn straight. I thought they just adapted him out and gave Barristan all his main traits.
Â 
Ser Duncan the Tall!
2196	Queen Sansa Stark	2014-04-07	I liked the Dunk the Tall reference and Sansa's "yeah. don't care about your sympathy so go away" reaction on Tyrion is absolutely golden. Now there is my precious little bird I love.Â
2197	Kungsmurfen	2014-04-07	I enjoyed pretty much everything in the episode! 
Â 
Was the man Oberyn choose the same guy that Loras had sex with in S3?
2198	Scrambled Aegon	2014-04-07	It was the same guy.
2199	Newstar	2014-04-07	Everyone's acting was on point. Kit Harington's acting had noticeably improved. Even Tony Way was leagues better than he was in Dontos' previous episode.
2200	Maria Underfoot	2014-04-07	And Sophie Turner was really good. I was surprised, but she moved me.... I miss Catelyn
2201	Er Rn	2014-04-07	Ser Duncan the Tall and Arthur Dayne!
Loved seeing Maester Aemon.
Oberyn was great.
Margaery and Olenna were great.
Arya and the Hound were great.
Jon was very much improved from the last two seasons.
The dragon cgi looked really cool.
The Dreadfort in the opening credits
2202	Maria Underfoot	2014-04-07	About the opening credits, was Winterfell a burning ruin, or did I just imagine it?
If yes, it was a nice touch
2203	cybobbie	2014-04-07	I loved the episode, the best premiere after the first season IMO. But to list some of my favorite moments I have to go with the majority here:Â Oberyn and Tyrion, Jon scene and the great lines from MaesterÂ Aemon and of course the whole scene at the inn with theÂ Hound and Arya. Ah, I also loved the scene of Dan and the dragons, of course.
2204	livernonions	2014-04-07	They nailed Oberyn.Â  His scenes told you everything you need to know abou him,Â  dangerous, reckless, arrogant, graceful, sensual, and fearless.Â  It woudl've been interesting to watch Oberyn interact with pre-Vargo Jaime, although I'mÂ not sure if one scene could handle that much ego!
Â 
I also enjoyed seeing this episode pull together events from each of the first three seasons (Ned's beheading, blackwater, red wedding), the writers did a great job of illustrating the gravity of all of these events and the shift in power from the Baratheons and Starks (counting Joffrey as a Lannister) to the Lannisters.
2205	livernonions	2014-04-07	About the opening credits, was Winterfell a burning ruin, or did I just imagine it?
If yes, it was a nice touch


They've been showing Winterfell as a burning ruin for awhile, at least since the season 3 premiere.
2206	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-07	The first scene was excellent. Really atmospheric, and the theme change from Stark to Lannister was well done.
Â 
Oberyn is very good. People here seemed to be worried about him, but he seems to have nailed the character so far. The positive aspect of the show is that we'll see more of him than just the few scenes he's in with Tyrion in the books.
Â 
I liked that they're trying to bring in mentions of other characters from the background: Elia and Rhaegar, as well as Arthur Dayne. While it's impossible for it to be as vast as the books, the show does a great job at showing the scope of this world.
Â 
The final scene was very good. Arya's murder of Polliver was quite chilling in the way she brutally stuck the sword into his throat, while methodically repeating his words. Different to the books where she seems more angry instead of cold, but still very good.
2207	'96Buck	2014-04-07	Statue of King Joffrey the Crossbowman, standing on a direwolf.Â  I didn't count the bolts in the wolf, should be 7 but I don't think it was. (Royal sculptor would credit Joff with "kills" for the youngest 3, I suppose)
2208	Takiedevushkikakzvezdy	2014-04-07	Is there an implied romance between Grey Worm and Missandei?
2209	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-07	The statue of Joffrey was a nice touch- comical, yet anger invoking. And people say the Iron Throne needs to be destroyed....right after that damn statue. I really hope it pops up again and is smashed....maybe someone can behead the thing!
Â 
Â The hellish, waste land shot of the Riverlands at the end. It was symbolic that Arya was heading down a destructive and dark path.
2210	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-07	Is there an implied romance between Grey Worm and Missandei? 


Â 
Yeah, I got that impression too, even with the way Missandei looked at Grey Worm.Â   I think it's a pretty cute pairing!Â
2211	Warhawk137	2014-04-07	Is there an implied romance between Grey Worm and Missandei? 


Â 
I certainly hope so.
2212	Warhawk137	2014-04-07	The statue of Joffrey was a nice touch- comical, yet anger invoking. And people say the Iron Throne needs to be destroyed....right after that damn statue. I really hope it pops up again and is smashed....maybe someone can behead the thing!

Now that is interesting! The guy is a freaking eunuch!
2214	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-07	Also, I quite liked that we got a scene between Jaime and Joffrey. Whether Jaime should've come back early or not, it's great that we got to see a scene between the two of them since we never do in the book.
2215	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-07	I would love for some GW/Missandei. GW still has a heart.
2216	Warhawk137	2014-04-07	Now that is interesting! The guy is a freaking eunuch!


Â 
Eh, they can adopt.Â  Not like blood is important in this story, right?
2217	Lord_Baelish	2014-04-07	Â 
Yeah, I got that impression too, even with the way Missandei looked at Grey Worm.Â   I think it's a pretty cute pairing!Â

I've never envied a man with no balls before.
2218	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-07	Now that is interesting! The guy is a freaking eunuch!


Â 
I know right!Â  
Â 
It's perfect, it has that tragic and beautifully romantic 'I don't care, we can hug!' vibe to it other relationships in the show lack because they're driven by lust.

Right.  Although I somehow feel that the show has enough romances as it is.Â
2220	Ser PeaCH	2014-04-07	They've been mentioned but bear repeating.Â  And I frequently negative nitpick GoT changes from the books but both of these are positive so...
Â 
White Book scene.Â  Joffrey poring over it, call-out to Duncan, tweaking Jamie about how blank his page is.
Â 
Arya and The Hound taking back Needle.Â  Everything about that scene was tremendous and I thought I was going to hate it that they didn't use Arya's book quotes but the lines they gave her were perfectly suited.Â  Would not change a thing.
2221	Chebyshov	2014-04-07	All of Missandei's Â shade that she was throwing.
Â 
For reference:Â https://24.media.tum...q0qieo1_400.gif

2223	Chebyshov	2014-04-07	Isn`t that scene (the ending) oddly similar to the "Mercy" chapter?


Â 
'Twas indeed. Which actually made me happy, because it means that D&D clearly had that chapter in their hands before Martin released it. So even if we don't get book 7 before S7, there's a good chance they'll have some or most of it.
2224	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-07	I loved how Oberyn pronounced Rhaegar's Name.
Â 
"Regar Targerian"
2225	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-07	I love the little hint of Grey Worm/Missandei too! I want eunuch cuddling!

But it kind of a shame that they will probably not be able to do that particular scene in the future.
Â 


I love the little hint of Grey Worm/Missandei too! I want eunuch cuddling!


I would gladly see more of Grey Worm/Missandei instead of the Tyrion/Shae/Sansa situation. And while HBO are at it, let`s hope they will make Bran go through puberty and fall head over heels for Meera!
2227	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-07	-Arya at the Inn Â 
-Rhaegar, Ser Arthur Dayne and Duncan the Tall being mentioned
-Oberyn talking about Elia (I had no idea her name should be pronounced like that)
-the blue rose
-Joffrey's statue (I couldn't stop laughing at it)


I was pretty happy that i was pronouncing both Oberyn's and Elia's name correctly the whole time.
Someone said (i think it was grammaerys) that when Aegon sacks KL, they should have the smallfolk tear down the Joff statue. Im gonna root for that.
Â 


(Er, is it really ok to use the term "spazzing"Â phoenix??).
Â 


Yes, so stop that.
Â 
The more i think about it, the more im all for the Missandei/Grey Worm ship. Its the cutest little tugboat in the romantic sea! Cuz there wont be likeÂ sexualÂ tension, its all about feelings! Awww
2228	Seneti	2014-04-07	Outside the obvious (Oberyn intro and Arya/Hound) I loved the stuff with Jon and the Thenns. Really cool intro for Thenns and Kit absolutely was phenomenal.Â 


Â 
Kit was amazing, particularly when he voluntarily mentioned his affair with Ygritte. It proves that he was not trying to justify his actions against Halfhand. He knows he did wrong. But he also knows where he did or did not cross the line. Like Sandor last year admitting to killing Mycah, but not the Targaryen children.
Â 
Â 


"What the fuck's a Lommy?" -- Had to pause until I regained my composure.


Â 
Same here. One of my roommates was still asleep and I had a really, really hard time not bursting into laughter and waking him up.
Â 


Â 
I agree. Then the very next scene was Joffrey standing with the exact same pose. Â 


Â 
Same as above. Hilarity ensues.
Â 
Â 
Add to this, the scene with Olenna, Margaery and the necklaces. Also, I love Olenna's dialogue when she meets Brienne. At first you think "oh no, she's gonna bully her like everyone else does", but then she is perfectly nice, polite and friendly to her. It's a nice contrast to Cersei's fake friendliness to everyone and everything.
Â 
Also, all the forshadowing... which I'm not gonna get into in this thread.
2229	Allison of Tarth	2014-04-07	I love it when the Hound swears.Oberyn's menace and swagger.House Manwoody reference.
2230	Florina Laufeyson	2014-04-07	Now, i really hope we get to meet Dickon Manwoody.
2231	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-04-07	Overall I must say that I am postively surprised by the acting. Only Emilia Clarke has been as emotionless as always. Especially Kit Harrington (I didn't know he was able to pull a perfomance like this after last season's average acting), Pedro Pascal and Sophie Turner were pure gold.
Â 
The Dontos/Sansa scene actually made me quite sad as well.
Â 
I think I begin to like Ser Alliser in the show as well. Did anyone else notice then return of Bowen Marsh? He was sitting next to Maester Aemon if I recall correctly.


Yeah, I only noticed it now after reading he Wiki that he is back in season 4. He lost his long hair, though.
2232	Misnthropia	2014-04-07	I loved the melting down of Ice. I think it was done very well. Although I feel some people may not have triggered whos sword it was and the symbolisation of it was lost. Throwing the wolf scabbard onto the fire, the music, Tywin watching over everything. I thought that was really well done.
Â 
I liked the meeting of Tyrion and Oberyn and I liked the embelishment on Elia and Rhaegar in that scene. Something that also would have gone over a lot of peoples heads. Seems they are definately going down the Elia rape route.
2233	Waylin Stark	2014-04-07	Arya's killing of Polliver was really powerful.
Â 
I feel her killing of Polliver and the Frey men in 3x10 as a substitute to her continuous stabbing of the Tickler is a good change from the books.
Â 
When she killed the Frey men, she was overcome by grief and wanted revenge on the Freys. Her continuous stabbing there made more sense.
And for Polliver, it also made more sense for her to kill him with Needle cold-heartedly, especially after what he did to Lommy and Needle.
It seems more realistic for her to kill them rather than stab the Tickler multiple times for torturing people, while repeating his questions.
Â 
And when she slowly drove Needle into Polliver's throat, it was so satisfying.Â
2234	Floop	2014-04-07	The scene where the Hound and Arya peer through their respective holes in the brush is pure joy. The guy that plays The Hound is a pleasure to watch. The dynamic between him and Arya is hands down the best thing about episode 1.
Â 
Olenna Tyrell is an absolute bad-ass, and any scene that she is in is elevated by her presence. Her brief interaction with Brienne is great. Brienne isn't often treated with respect - at least in the books that correspond to these episodes - no spoilers, don't worry - so it felt good to see her greatness recognized, especially from such a formidable, respect-worthy character as Olenna. Good feelings all around.

2235	averde	2014-04-07	I loved the whole Sandor and Arya dynamic. It's better then the books.
2236	bobbybuilderton	2014-04-07	OH and Brienne's little restrained smile when Olenna praised her for beating Loras. She was probably super uncomfortable with Olenna's exclamations but when she realized she wasn't going to tease her but instead seemed impressed, she has this little smile she tries to suppress. Good job, Gwendoline Christie.
2237	mafalda	2014-04-07	I LOVED the first scene, though not many Unsullied got it. I guess that's why they tried to put in that random shot of Ned with Ice in the clips they aired prior to the episode, but still.Â 
Â 
Kit's acting has gotten so much better! I actually paid attention to him this time.. usually whenever he speaks I suddenly find myself on my phone. Something about his voice. But his delivery and voice were so much better. He should pass on his acting coach's number to Emilia 
Â 
"The fuck's a lommy?" lmao
Â 
The pacing was really good this episode too. I'm glad that the show runners have realized they don't need to check on every character in the premiere. Though I did miss Roose!
Â 
Why does Podrick Payne look so different to me?? Did he lose weight? Looks pretty good..Â 
Â 
As over the top as Oberyn's introduction was, he was still badass. They picked THE perfect actors for him and Ellaria! And I loved hearing him talk about Elia and Rhaegar, etc.. I wish the show would discuss that more. Hell, I wish the books would discuss it more too!Â 
Â 
And, yes the whole cast is talented, but I think Sophie Turner (Sansa) is amazing to watch. She gets better and better each season. Listening to her talk about the Red Wedding and what they did to Robb and Grey Wind while she was crying nearly made me tear up!
Â 
Next week looks promising

2240	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	I didn't like how the 'chase' went down, but the scene with Ser Dontos was very good, and Sansa owned the scene with Tyrion. So much for those who decided to write it off with 'f*** this show' comments before they had seen the episode.

Â 
Her essentially "Sansa out" heel-turn made me clap.Â
2242	shiola	2014-04-07	It's a little thing, but I loved, loved, loved that moment when Oberyn tilted up Tyrion's chin to force Tyrion to look him in the eye, and Tyrion quickly shoved his hand aside with one finger without breaking eye contact. A lot said with those two gestures: Oberyn's casual, arrogant violation of Tyrion's personal space and forcing a confrontation, and Tyrion quietly and angrily asserted himself even though his role forced him to play nice with Oberyn and prevented him from talking shit.


Â 
Yes!! Absolutely loved this as well
2243	shiola	2014-04-07	About the opening credits, was Winterfell a burning ruin, or did I just imagine it?
If yes, it was a nice touch


Â 
This may have been answered already but, yes, Winterfell was burning. Â It has been a burning ruin in the credits since the end of season 2, I believe.
2244	Currawong	2014-04-07	The comedy of opposites. Brothel scene: Oberyn suggests more women, and Bronn nods enthusiastically while Tyrion (yes, Tyrion!!) shakes his head at the same time.
Â 
Perfectly mirrored at the end of the Jaime/Cersei scene when the servant girl knocks at the door.Â  Cersei tells her to come in, while Jaime is telling her to go away.Â

Â 
I adored that at as a character moment, though didn't see it as having comedic value like the Bronn/Tyrion thing.
Â 
Jaime shouting "Go away" showing that he wants to keep talking to Cersei and try to understand/fix things.. Â Cersei shouting "Come in" essentially telling Jaime, "We're done here. Â I have nothing more to say to you, and I don't want to hear anything you have to say to me." Â

Â 
Yesss, it was perfect. Â So pants-shittingly intimidating. Â 
Â 
I also liked when Dany was petting Drogon in the beginning of the scene, his tail was wagging lazily, and his wings did this little twitch during the zoomed-out shot... It was like a sleepy puppy getting pet.
Â 
And then you try to take the sleepy puppy's bone away, and he tears off your face.

Â 
The costuming has always been great, but I agree. Just from this one episode it felt like everything was much more intricate, bright and unique. Not since The Lord of the Rings trilogy have I fell so in love with a series' costumes and props.
2252	MarieAntoinette	2014-04-08	I liked Oberyn, and also his coat. Loved the suns on the fabric.

Â 
I'm looking forward to the upcoming episodes.  Good to have the show back.
2253	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-08	Another reason the cold opening worked so well was that it went straight back to Tywin after the credits. Flowed together brilliantly.

2254	lizziebeth	2014-04-08	There was so much to love in this episode!
Â 
The opening with the melting down of Ice.Â  I was watching with two Unsullied friends and neither of them understood what was going on. Meanwhile I was feeling so sad/angry at the symbolic destruction of House Stark and reforging it for Lannister, with Tywin looking on, silent and menacing with Rains playing over it.Â  Perfectly excuted for me, but I guess not obvious enough for some Unsullied.
Â 
Arya and the Hound were by far my favorite part of the episode.Â  Pretty much every word out of Sandor's mouth was gold. And Arya's character progression is moving right along.Â  I would happily watch a spin-off of these two wandering throughout Westeros getting into fights in inns.
Â 
Second best part was the intro of Oberyn and Ellaria. I cannot wait to see more of them.
Â 
As many others have said, I too was happily surprised at Kit's acting this episode.Â  He really held my attention and was interesting to me for the first time in a long time. The whole trial scene was great. Janos Slynt being an ass. Maester Aemon got a few one-liners that made me chuckle.
Â 
Lady Olenna's response to Brienne was one of the most pleasant surprises of the episode.Â  Brienne is so used to being mocked that she didn't seem to know what to do when someone actually appreciates her.Â  Beautifully played by Gwen Christie and Diana Rigg.
Â 
Sansa and Dontos was far more emotionally affecting than I thought it would be.Â  I never really cared about Dontos in the books, but I find I actually care about him in the show.Â 
Â 
The child slaves on the road to Mereen was well done. Suitably horrifying to make viewers hate the Mereenese long before we get to the city.Â  Also, the dragons are getting so big!Â 
Â 
Is it just me or is Pod getting hotter?Â 
Â 
Jamie's little wave with his new hand was probably the funniest thing I've seen in a while.Â  I had to pause the show because I was laughing too hard. Also my Unsullied friends finally understand my laughter over Locke's line last season about "buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it".
Â 
Joffrey is a douchey little cunt as usual.Â  I was kinda hoping Jamie would slap him with the golden hand but alas it's would be pretty inappropriate for a Kingsguard to strike the King he's protecting.
2255	SheRa Seastar	2014-04-08	I'm happy that Sandor was not injured
Â 
I also liked Grey Worm showing feelings for Dany, I cared for new Daario even less than for the old one.

I thought he liked Missandai?  
I liked the exchange between daario and grey worm 'I'd rather have no brains and two balls'
2256	Loerwyn	2014-04-08	I also loved the scene with Arya and The Hound. I must remember to repeat what the Hound said to my colleague some day.
Â 
I have to confess I liked the scenes between Brienne, Lady Olenna and Margaery. I think it's reasonable she'd go to them. Firstly, Margaery was Renly's wife, so she'd go to her to tell her side of the story first. Plus when you think about it, if she'd told Loras first she'd risk a fight, so going to M first and getting her assurances essentially safeguards her. Plus I just love Lady Olenna anyway, and the way she spoke to Brienne was just awesome. I don't ever know how to read Margaery, I think she's arguably one of the most devious and cunning characters in the show (and her actress is absolutely amazing with her), but I honestly can't see her turning on Bri... um... well, I know what's gonna happen now.

Â 


I too liked Kit's scenes in this episode , but can we stop saying that his acting skills have gotten better or anything like that? Do all the characters have to act and talk like a badass to be considered interesting and "good acting"?
Â 
One of the great things about a series is that you can do character growth. Jon was quiet, inmature and brooding at first. He knew nothing. It had nothing to do with Kit's acting skills (or with the Iceland weather!). Now he's back from his mission and he's matured, he's more talkative, he "knows" things. He's not being ordered anymore. Yes, he's more badass and probably more entertaining. But again, it has nothing to do with Kit's acting.

Â 


Â 
It's not that he talked like a badass, for me. Â He's had moments of badassery before. Â I just never liked his acting. Â He was never interesting and he didn't make me believe he is Jon Snow. Â Charles, Nikolaj, Michelle, Conleth-- all of them have made their characters come alive and make me forget I am watching a show. Â Kit, so far, had been one of a handful of actors that didn't become their character. Â But now he seems believable. Â I'm excited to see if he keeps it up. Â
2264	CKPS63	2014-04-10	Re the Gray Worm/Missandei ship -- I had a completely different reaction to that scene -- 
	Spoiler My first thought was that they were merging Gray Worm with Missandei's brother, Stalwart Shield, who (in the books anyway) gets knocked off by the Sons of the Harpies in Mereen -- that's why Torko Nudo tells New Daario that he's "not smart" when New Daario suggests there's something romantic going on between them.
2265	Bleiz	2014-04-10	I agree with what has been mentioned so far! SO many good little bits in this episode...
Â 
Did anyone else like the parallel between Sansa and Oberyn:-
Â 
Oberyn: And my sister. You know what they did to her?
Â 
Sansa:Â  Do you know what they did to my brother?
Â 
Both gave me goosebumps
2266	WTFSalami	2014-04-10	Did anyone else pick up on the way in which Arya hamstrings Polliver? It was very waterdancer, Syrio Forell inspired. She seemed to come up behind him, fake slightly to the left, and then bringing the sword across to end almost in a curtsey that she held for a second. I loved the subtle gracefulness in which she did that maneuver.Â

Â 
The real question is not whether he keeps it up. The question is will they keep up the writing that he finally got. They never cared about or wrote the character particularly well before. Only twice have they done a good job and one of those times was a GRRM written episode. The rest of the time, he barely has lines much less anything substantive, so you can't compare him with actors who have been getting good writing since he hasn't been. Not at all.

I'm gonna have to leave this at "agreeing to disagree", because I don't want to keep this conversation going in this thread. Â It's not the place for it.

Â 
I noticed that she did that, but I didn't catch that it was similar to a waterdancer style! Â Good catch! Â I also liked that The Hound stabbed the guy in the dick who Polliver mentioned liked his girls "a bit broken in" or whatever.
2270	Simon Steele	2014-04-13	I liked Oberyn's talk with Tyrion, one of the better moments of the series.
Â 
I actually really like Dontos. Not sure why. Something about him is very sympathetic.
Â 
More building of the Mountain with (WHICH HAS BEEN NEEDED FOR 3 SEASONS NOW, sorry about that) not only Oberyn, but the discussion about him in the inn at the end of the episode. One of the Mountain's more cruel moments.
2271	Q the Cat	2014-04-13	I really loved the intro. Â The scene started with a sweet, lonely rendition of the Stark/Winterfell theme and ended with Rains of Castamere. Â Tywin fully conquering the Starks.
Â 
Then I loved the ending with Arya getting Needle back, subtly telling the viewers they can't count the Starks down and out yet.
2272	RedtheWarrior	2014-04-13	I love John's scene in front of Thorne and Slynt, especially the exchange ofÂ 
Jon: have you ever been beyond the wall?
Slynt: I was Commander of the City Watch etc
Jon: And now you're here, you must not have been very good at it.
Â 
Paraphrasing from memory there but I think that line shows the change in Jon, after all he's been through he is no longer working so hard to prove himself to everyone especially people he once would have thought of as above him. He has a purpose now to defend the Wall from the Free Folk, he is less of a lost young man still looking for his place unsure if he has found it. The fact that all that was conveyed in that one scene, (and for me to a certain point, conveyed in that one line) just gave me shivers.
Â 
Also

	Spoiler  Tyrion and Oberyn referring to themselves as "second sons" that exact phrase twice in one scene, foreshadowing for Tyrion, I just loved it!
2273	lostinwesteros	2014-04-14	Hands down, it was the exchange between The Hound and Polliver about the chicken.  Give it a ten out of ten, and then seeing Arya and Sandor riding off, Arya with that horse she wanted, and Sandor with his chicken.  Priceless.
2274	WinterKing	2014-04-06	Please,share with us.
2275	Mark Antony	2014-04-06	My brother thinks Tywin will have Shae hangedÂ
2276	espec22	2014-04-06	My family believe that Aria is really going to see her aunt and finally be safe.
2277	Obebb	2014-04-06	My friend was wondering if Dontos will be important at all. She's a big fan of Petyr so I told her "He speaks with Petyr's voice"Â  Â and that the necklace would be important.
2278	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-06	My brother thinks Jon Snow will be legitimized and become King of either the North or even Westeros.
Â 
My dad thought that Dany would arrive in Westeros on the back of her dragons this season, until I accidentally let slip that in the books she's basically lost all interest in her previously life-consuming goal (which I suppose tends to happen when you get married?).

2279	Natasi	2014-04-06	My friend said Arya could be a Queen with the way she acted in her final scenes. Queen Stark he said. I had to school him on how it's not all about who sits on a damn throne. And alluded to the fact she gets her own storyline apart from the rest. He was upset and said, but it's called Game of Thrones! And I said, only the first of 7 books was called that!
2280	Mr Hodor	2014-04-06	my cousin this Arya will become a great warrior under Sandor.
2281	Knight of Ashes	2014-04-07	They still think Dany's name is 'Khaleesi'. 
I dunno why I don't bother correcting them.
2282	The Drunkard	2014-04-07	A friend thinks Oberyn is going to assassinate Tywin at the wedding, half-because Tywin and Joffrey are both so sure everything is safe.
Â 
He's also gone from being ambivalent to the wildlings to wanting them stopped.
2283	Ramsay Gimp	2014-04-07	My friend said Arya could be a Queen with the way she acted in her final scenes. Queen Stark he said.

Â 
The whole "who's going to win the Throne?" or "Who do you think belongs on the Throne?" thing, as if every character is a contender, Â is pretty grating
Â 
Arya as Queen of the 7 Kingdoms?Â
2284	ohpooratlas	2014-04-07	Yeah, my boyfriend was like "YEAH. GO ARYA!" And I was like "... you don't find it sad or creepy? She's completely lost everything about her identity other than her drive for vengeance."
Â 
And he was like "I can see her eventually ending up with a black heart, but basically I'm fine with it because F those guys."
Â 
So ... the show really doesn't seem to be delivering on the whole "this is a really dark and sad path Arya is going down." But maybe it's too early to tell.
2285	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-07	A friend thinks that the A-rabs are going to turn Cersei's mouth to ash because they hate her freedom
2286	Envie	2014-04-07	Family responses:
Â 
1. Oberyn Martell is going to kill all the Lannisters at Joffrey's wedding just like they killed all the Starks! (this was a pretty good guess I thought)
Â 
2. The dragons are going to go wild and kill someone, hopefully not Daenarys or the cute little brown girl (wtf) - again, another good premonition well hinted at in the episode.
Â 
3. Jaime Lannister needs to bitchslap Joffrey like Tyrion did. (I explained he can't do that now that Joffrey's the king but they said he still needed slapped again LOL)
Â 
4. Arya Stark is a BAMF and needs to avenge her family by killing the Lannisters along with Oberyn so maybe they should go back to King's Landing and the Hound will help her.
2287	Runaway Bunny	2014-04-07	A lot of people I watched with think Shae is going to be killed, though they think it'll be by Cersei/Tywin. Not too far off I suppose =P
2288	chrismlloyd	2014-04-07	My OH asked why Tyrion didn't say anything to Oberyn after he basically threatened Tywin and I replied 'Tyrion doesn't really like his dad.' My OH's response to that was 'not enough to want him dead though'
2289	Fool of a Book	2014-04-07	Two biggest thoughts from my non-reader friends:
Â 
"I can't wait til Dany gets to Westeros! Â It's gonna be soon, right?" Â 
Â 
and
Â 
"I can't wait til Sam tells Jon that Bran and Rickon are alive!.... wait, why didn't this happen?"
Â 
They also think Oberyn will be killing a Lannister for sure, and are confused why Arya doesn't head to the Wall. Â They're also very confused why Sansa has completely forgotten about Jon. Â She certainly knows where he is.

On this point I break the 'No Spoilers Rule'.Â

I explain to them that:
She is still half a planet away
Still has no ships to get her army there (needs a LOT of ships)
Has 50,000+ mouths to feed
Has dragons that are not yet fully grown, are untrained 'teenagers', and can't be ridden yet
Has yet to find two other dragon-riders.
All that isn'tÂ really a spoiler and it prepares them to accept the coming Meeren Years.
Â 
Without exception, that explanation has stopped any question about "When is she going to Westeros?". They start thinking of the logistics and many of them actually start paying attention to other storylines instead of solely on the 'Hottie with the dragons"

I hope when she takes Meereen, they really explain the lack of ships and the "Demon Road" to the audience.Â  In the books staying was the only decision she could have made really.
2295	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-07	My mom has overheard some of my convos with my dad about Jon Snow's parentage and so apparently she's really confused and believes that Elia is Jon's aunt and that Jon is somehow related to Prince Oberyn???
Â 
My unsullied hubby didn't make any comments other than loving the episode. I think he's still taking it in. I had to explain the sword part to him.Â
2296	protar	2014-04-07	My Mum's insights on the episode:
Â 
Dany's realising that she's just a mere mortal, with Drogon snapping at her (or is she as mere mortal). And Olenna will be jealous of Sansa's jewelry, and maybe steal it? Clearly this is very important. But then again depending on where they take the poison hairnet maybe it will be.
2297	Falcon92	2014-04-07	A friend made a very accurate guess, if he would have said it to me face to face IRL and not on the skype-chat I don't think I'd be able to hold my tongue, the prediction was that good. What he said was basically this:
Â 
"The Hound and Arya will go to the Eyrie, but the Arryn's won't welcome them because they want to remain neutral in the war. Arya will escape from the Eyrie and travel to the east to train to become an assassin."
Â 
If I didn't know him any better I'd say he'd spoiled himself on the web or so but I'm pretty sure that's not the case.

Â 
Yeah, I always point out the ships thing. How exactly is Dany getting to Westeros with an army and no ships? Â They never have a response. They just want her there.
2299	gotgrrrl	2014-04-07	My unsullied husband thinks there is "something up with the whole necklace thing".Â  Olenna's search for a necklace for Margaery and then Sansa getting a necklace from Dontos.Â  Seemed like too much of a coincidence for him.Â  He's not usually that observant. Â
2300	hhh	2014-04-07	My brother concurred with me in his liking for the Hound and dislike for Daenerys. He found it hard to remember a lot of references to the past like who Rhaegar was and what Qorin HAlfhand and Mance Rayder did with Jon. It really makes me think that the show will approach the ending with very broad strokes and a liberal interpretation, because detail packs rather than specific plot points are key to making the show emotionally resonant for a wide audience. Dany's ADWD arc could be really well wrapped up in this format, for example.
2301	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-04-07	my friend said that until the thenns showed up, he didnt know who to root for, jon or ygritte. people tend to be pissed at jon for leaving her.
i made him realize that ygritte is on the wrong side (kind of).
also, people didnt realize who's sword that was at the beginning or who janos slynt was.
2302	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-04-07	also, people are still obsessed with "khaleesi" ugh. so annoying. people dont realize that she's aweful or that that's not her name. and everyone was confused about the new daario
2303	~DarkHorse~	2014-04-07	My unsullied friend believes that something will happen to Shae and Tyrion will be put in prison for not kneeling in front of Joffrey (seen Joffrey yelling 'kneel' in episode 2 promo). Also, worried that Dany wont be able to control her dragons.Â
2304	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-07	It's good to hear that most Unsullied have no f-ing clue what's going to happen this season. It's only going to make it that much better for them.Â
2305	ohpooratlas	2014-04-07	I'm pretty sure everyone is going to be shocked that the show does such a major death so early in the season too. 
Â

2306	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-07	An unsullied friend just asked me about the Sword from the Intro. I explained him it was Ice. He then checked the wiki (for the sword) and told me that showJoffrey already has Widow's Wail before, which is odd because WW is recently made.
Â 
Contradiction? (I can't really remember this). We're both confused.

He had Hearteater in "Blackwater," not Widow's Wail.
2308	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-04-07	A lot of people I watched with think Shae is going to be killed, though they think it'll be by Cersei/Tywin. Not too far off I suppose =P


Â 
I'm guessing that's probably what they will do in the show. Â Cersei's spy saw Shae leaving Tyrion's apartment. Â I think they will make Shae a martyr and Tyrion will only kill Tywin.
2309	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-07	He had Hearteater in "Blackwater," not Widow's Wail.


Â 
Ah, thanks!
2310	lyanna_maria	2014-04-07	My flatmate is always very observant and perceptive, and she has an amazing memory: but she didn't remember Janos Slynt, even when I tried to explain it to her. I don't think she knew Alliser Thorne either; with him, I didn't even try!
2311	ohpooratlas	2014-04-07	I have to admit that until I read the books (and reread them, at that) ... I had a hard time placing who all the NIght's Watch people were. So I'm not surprised that people would not remember.
Â 
Also ... I can't recall, but did we even get the scene where Tyrion sends Janos to the wall in the "previously on?" Because without that, unsullied viewers really had little to go on when it came to Slynt.
2312	Lord_Baelish	2014-04-07	My manager says she really wants Joffrey to die. I told her she'll have to wait a while yet - he still needs to get married first.
2313	lyanna_maria	2014-04-07	Also ... I can't recall, but did we even get the scene where Tyrion sends Janos to the wall in the "previously on?" Because without that, unsullied viewers really had little to go on when it came to Slynt.


Â 
You're right, we did not. All we get it "I was the Commander of the City Watch of King's Landing!" by him, and I don't think that's enough! I don't blame the Unsullied: I was an Unsullied once, and I know all the Night's Watch men look pretty much the sameÂ   and it's difficult to keep track of them.Â
2314	ohpooratlas	2014-04-07	I have a shameful and embarrassing confession to make: I didn't even know who was Dolorous Edd on the show until a few weeks ago when I watched one of the season 3 commentaries and they were like "And here's Grenn and Dolorous Edd ..." lmao!
2315	GeorgeIAF	2014-04-07	One of my Unsullied shocked me =)) In a good wayÂ 
Â 
He is a big fan of the show and viewed the first 3 seasons like 2-3 times, and knows more details from the show than most of us. I'm also sure that he didnt read spoilers because he hates that, even in ordinary movies he doesnt like to hear others opinions before he watches them.Â 
Â 
So long story short, when Oberyn was talking about Elia and that Rhaegar left her for another woman, he says to us, wouldnt be awesome if that woman is Jon's mother ? He was saying to us that Ned said in one of the first episodes that he'll talk with Jon about his mother when he returns, really spot on from my man =))

Thinks Oberyn is creepy and angry, and isn't a fan.
Thinks Styr looks fierce and scary in a cool way. He's a "bit of a beast".

2318	fangirl000	2014-04-07	Heh - my husband ignored the blue flower completely, and focused on the poison flower. Â "Whelp, someone is getting poisoned!" Â And as far as the gift of the necklace to Sansa - "That was weird but sweet. Â He's going to die."Â

2322	lyanna_maria	2014-04-07	Ok, I've chatted with my flatmate and here are her thought on the episode:
Â 

She keeps repeating how magnificent this show is and how much she loved the episode.


She prefers this Daario, and she pities Jorah. She is suddenly fully aware of how dangerous the dragons are and is quite scared of them.


She is impressed by Jon's (Kit's?) new confidence and charisma. By the way, I explained it better and now I think she remembers Slynt and even Thorne.


She was shocked at the coldness in Arya while killing Polliver, and thinks she's very scary now. She thinks it's understandable but ver, very sad that she's gone down that path of murder and revenge.


She also pities Sansa, and Ser Dontos, and I think she's a bit fed up with Shae. She thinks Cersei is a bit nuts , and that Tywin is very imposing and threatening but also so mean to both his sons. In fact, she didn't like how basically everyone was mean to Jaime in this episode.


I pointed out how Margaery seems so calm in spite of being about to marry a monster, and she replied that she doesn't need to because she's clever and cunning, and knows her way around (unlike Sansa), and she will manage.


The details of the Red Wedding keep horrifying her (as does all blood/violence in the show), and Jon's reminiscing touched her. Â Â

2323	NikkiG	2014-04-07	My Dad said Joffrey better buy it soon and it better NOT be something weak that finishes him off, like poisonÂ
2324	mafalda	2014-04-07	My brother was very confused at the beginning and kept texting me about the sword and whether or not it was important, he was very curious about this "other woman" Rhaegar left "that guy's sister" for. He thinks Dany is going to collect poisonous flowers and use them as a weapon. If her dragons don't kill her first, that is. Oh and asked who was that guy who gave her the flowers.Â 
Â 


I have a shameful and embarrassing confession to make: I didn't even know who was Dolorous Edd on the show until a few weeks ago when I watched one of the season 3 commentaries and they were like "And here's Grenn and Dolorous Edd ..." lmao!


I didn't either! Until I came on here and people were talking about him, and I was like wtf and had to rewatch!Â
2325	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	also, people are still obsessed with "khaleesi" ugh. so annoying. people dont realize that she's aweful or that that's not her name. and everyone was confused about the new daario


Â 
Har!
Â 
I usually just say "How many times does she have to screech 'My name is Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen!' before you realise what her name is?"Â
2326	bobbybuilderton	2014-04-07	There are some who realize her name is Daenerys and just choose to call her Khaleesi. I do not understand that, but I also don't care for nicknames so...
The ones who insist on calling her that are also the ones who will never get their noses out of her ass to realize she sucks and Emilia can't act.
2327	Kyrion	2014-04-07	Its because Edds name was only mentioned once on the show lol it was when Samwell had called out to Grenn and Edd in the Season 2 finale, its hard for show only readers to remember him. Its kind of the problem they had in the pilot episode with not giving exposition for characters, now they forget to mention the name of certain characters lol
2328	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-07	Â 
You're right, we did not. All we get it "I was the Commander of the City Watch of King's Landing!" by him, and I don't think that's enough!

What's funny is they'll almost definitely remember Tyrion's "I'm not questioning your honor... I'm denying its existence."
2329	The Giver	2014-04-07	My sister thought that when Tywin was havin the swords made and he threw the fur covering in the fire, that he was making some kind of animal sacrifice.
Â
2330	ohpooratlas	2014-04-07	I'm glad I'm not the only one who was confused as to who Doloraus Edd was!
Â 
Regarding the whole "Khaleesi" thing ... I usually remind people that "Khaleesi" is a title, as in "My Queen" or used as "Your grace." Once I tell them that ... it usually nips it in the butt. Usually. 
Â 
I call Daenerys "Dany" all the time though, because that's how she's referred to in the books ... and my boyfriend always gets mad at me or says "Who?" At least he knows her name is Daenerys though.

Â 
My theory: muscle memory. Â Daenerys has a weird vowel order, ae-e-y, by English standards. It looks wrong to the eyes, it feels wrong to type, you second guess yourself while typing it and afterward...
Â 
Khaleesi, on the other hand... a-ee-i is much more natural, even if its just another made up word.
2335	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	A quote from another place that I found hilarious!
Â 
"So what do you think about all this news that the actor playing king geoffrey wants to quite the show? I'm quite pleased actually, can't stand that character... or the actor to be fair.. wonder how and who they would replace him with..? I think they'll probably carry with the story but set it maybe a year onwards for the next season so the replaced character would look a little older and slightly different.

But alas.. producers will probably bribe him some how to stay on, people love to hateÂ king geoffrey."

  Cool in a scary way he said. And I can sort of see where he was coming from with Oberyn, he did come across as a bit pervy.

Â 
Don't feel bad, I didn't realise Ed was Ed until season e (and honestly, I barely took note of him when reading the books).
Â 
Yeah I call her Dany among the Unsullied as well, I think they've finally got the idea now.
Â 
My friend is pretty scared of Oberyn, but she thinks he might kill Joffery (or as she calls him, Dickhead) and says if he does then he can stick around.
Â 
One of my mates was really upbeat about Arya's situation... until I pointed out the parallel with child soldiers, and after that he sobered up a bit.
Â 
Most people seem really into the Hound; depending on how his 'death' plays out, there could be some tears for him come the end of the season.
2340	Tose	2014-04-08	also, people didnt realize who's sword that was at the beginning


They showed Ice (and Ned) for like the last 10 Seconds in the "previously on" right before the cold opening. Got to think that should be enough of a reminder.
2341	stinky peasant	2014-04-08	my wife loves the show, but can't for life of her remember anybody's name, which sigils go with which house, and what the last names of some of the houses are. Â she knows what's going on with jon, arya, dany, and that's about it at this point. Â i pause and explain a LOT. Â its frustrating because she is REALLY smart... Â

The ones who insist on calling her that are also the ones who will never get their noses out of her ass to realize she sucks and Emilia can't act.


Â 
I think it has something to do with the sound of the name. What's your first thought when you hear the word "Daenerys"? Mine is "strange and unattractive" (the ae and e sound like a grotesque mutation between the vowels a and e). What's your first thought when you hear "Khaleesi"? Mine is "strong yet feminine". So, yeah, if I didn't know just how pissed off book walkers get when you call Dany Khaleesi, I would call her that as well.
Â

Â 
I know, right? Usually, I like to defend show watchers because GoT is about as complex and complicated as entertainment TV can get, but seriously! They just showed him pulling the sword from the scabbard and then getting beheaded by it 10 seconds before the forge scene! Even goldfish have short term memory that lasts that long.
2343	bobbybuilderton	2014-04-08	I didn't think anything when I heard her called those two things. My first thought was "Her name is Daenerys." and "That's probably the feminine form of khal." They're both made up words and I treated them as such. I'm not thinking about the feel of a name when I hear it. It probably comes down to a fundamental difference in the way people process information. It's still irritating though.

2345	The Monkey	2014-04-08	Everyone seems to hate Shae with a passion, and find her jealousy not only boring, but also very likely to get her killed by Tywin or Cersei. Â
2346	Lontra	2014-04-08	Hi, I lurk and read the threads a lot but this is my first post. Whenever I think of something I want to add someone else already has!
My unsullied husband is convinced that Jaimie is going to kill Joffrey.Â  He says that they are "softening" Jaimie's character and "he killed that other bat shit crazy king" so he'll be the most likely to kill this one.Â  When I reminded him that Joffrey is Jaimie's son (he forgot!) he thought maybe not. He said that maybe he'll let someone else do it.
He did notice Oberyn's comments about R +L. He also said that Arya is turning into a psychopath and the Hound seems like an OK guy.
He has a lot of trouble keeping the characters straight.Â  He uses me as a sort of playlist and asks "who's that again?" throughout the episodes.Â  I have to rewatch them.
I'm really not surprisedÂ  when I think of how much flipping back I had to do the first time I read the books!
By the way, he loves that nonreaders are called unsullied.
2347	lyanna_maria	2014-04-09	I have a friend who has read the books only up to the first half of Storm of Swords, more or less. She hadn't gotten to the part where Oberyn is introduced: she loves him and how badass he is.
Â 
She told me something very, very interesting: she thinks if she hadn't read any of the books, she wouldn't have realised that Jorah has romantic feelings for Daenerys. She would think that he loves her as a daughter. What do your friends/family think?Â

Maybe it is OTT , but i still believe his scenes where the most awesome in the episode. From the moment he heard the guy singing Rains of Castamere till when he stabbed his hand was pure Red Viper epicness that kept me on the edge of my seat.

Thanks for the post, and very interesting on your hubby's thoughts about Jaime killing another king who needs it.Â  Perhaps that is something that D&D want the Unsullied to consider with Jaime's early return.

I hate that he never calls her her name, yes. Only because it confuses some of the less intelligent people. Specifically the ones who thought Ice was Robb's sword even though they visually spelled it out mere seconds before by showing the unsheathing of Ned's sword the same way in two scenes.
Â 
Anyway, quite a few of the unspoiled people seem to think Tywin didn't really disown Jaime.
2356	ground_control	2014-04-09	Anyway, quite a few of the unspoiled people seem to think Tywin didn't really disown Jaime.


Technically, he didn't. Â At best he acknowledged that he had lost Jaime years ago.
In reality, he didn't either -- unless you think Tywin is sentimental enough to let a Valyrian Steel sword out of the family.
Â 
All Tywin is doing is losing the hand (ha ha) as least gracefully as he can without leaving the game entirely.
2357	bobbybuilderton	2014-04-09	He does disown him and that's when he does it. Â After Jaime refuses all the stuff Tywin wants him to take. Unless I have a faulty copy of the book, he gives Jaime the sword, tells him to take Casterly Rock, leave the kingsguard, Jaime refuses, and he explicitly disowns him. Maybe they're going a different route, but assuming they aren't, Jaime was disowned in that scene. They just changed the dialogue for some reason.
Â 

Jaime stood. â<U+0080><U+009C>I am tired of having highborn
women kicking pails of shit at me, Father. No one ever asked me if I wanted to be Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, but it seems I am. I have a dutyâ<U+0080><U+0094>â<U+0080><U+009D>

Tommen should accompany you, as your ward and squire. The Rock is where heâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll learn to be a Lannister, and I want him away from his mother. I mean to find a new husband for Cersei. Oberyn Martell perhaps, once I convince Lord Tyrell that the match does not threaten Highgarden. And it is past time you were wed. The Tyrells are now insisting that Margaery be wed to Tommen, but if I were to offer you insteadâ<U+0080><U+0094>â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>NO!â<U+0080><U+009D> Jaime had heard all that he could stand. No, more than he could stand.

Firelight gleamed golden in the stiff whiskers that framed Lord Tywinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s face. A vein pulsed in his neck, but he did not speak. And did not speak. And did not speak. The strained silence went on until it was more than Jaime could endure. â<U+0080><U+009C>Father . . . â<U+0080><U+009D> he began.
â<U+0080><U+009C>You are not my son.â<U+0080><U+009D> Lord Tywin turned his face away. â<U+0080><U+009C>You say you are the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, and only that. Very well, ser. Go do your duty.â<U+0080><U+009D>

The way it's written in the show has it so that Tywin makes a catty comment about a man with no family. The unspoiled people understood that as him referring to Jaimie's lack of children, and Jaime inferring that he was disowned.

2358	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-10	^ That is the first time I have read those words since Dance appeared in the show...
Â 
All I can picture is the S3 scene telling Cersei she was to marry Loras and transposing that Tywin into this scene.
2359	changalang	2014-04-10	There are some who realize her name is Daenerys and just choose to call her Khaleesi. I do not understand that, but I also don't care for nicknames so...
The ones who insist on calling her that are also the ones who will never get their noses out of her ass to realize she sucks and Emilia can't act.


Â 
Slighty OT, but didja hear about this?Â http://www.bustle.co...baby-name-lists
Â 
But I would think these are the people that don't realize that her name is Daenerys. For example, my friend (who watches the show lol), who when I explained a favourite actor of mine was coming into the role of Daario, had to explain who he was by explaining he was Dany's love interest at the end of S3. And then had to explain that Dany was the Khaleesi, you know, the one with the blond hair? Lol.

2360	Awake iron!	2014-04-10	An unsullied friend just asked me about the Sword from the Intro. I explained him it was Ice. He then checked the wiki (for the sword) and told me that showJoffrey already has Widow's Wail before, which is odd because WW is recently made.
Â 
Contradiction? (I can't really remember this). We're both confused.


Â 
I think I remember Joffrey getting Widow's Wale (the smaller sword) back in time, so my take in it is that the "prologue" scene in this episode 4x01 (Tywin reforging Ice into two swords) chronologically belongs to that time, after Ned's death, and after Tywin is back in KL for the Blackwater battle. So Jaime's sword has been waiting for him all this time in King's Landing. And then there's a time jump in the episode when Tywin gives the sword to Jaime, now that he's back from his imprisonment and journey with Brienne.

Â 
Joffrey's sword that he currently has is 'Heart Eater'. He doesn't have 'Widow's Wail' yet.
2362	Awake iron!	2014-04-10	Â 
Joffrey's sword that he currently has is 'Heart Eater'. He doesn't have 'Widow's Wail' yet.


Â 
Ok, I was in the wrong then. Maybe because the timing is slightly different in the books. So I guess we'll see Joffrey getting Widow's Wale as a wedding present in the next episode.
2363	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-10	I hate that he never calls her her name, yes. Only because it confuses some of the less intelligent people. Specifically the ones who thought Ice was Robb's sword even though they visually spelled it out mere seconds before by showing the unsheathing of Ned's sword the same way in two scenes.
Â 
Anyway, quite a few of the unspoiled people seem to think Tywin didn't really disown Jaime.


Â 
OMG!!Â  I can't tell you how many written reviews of the show I've read that started out with the words "Robb Stark's sword" in the first paragraph.Â  That was my cue to stop reading, LOLÂ

Â 
Joff's swords:
Â 
Lion's Tooth........chucked by Arya into the Trident
Hearteater.........kissed by Sansa before the Blackwater
Widow's Wail..........coming soon, LOLÂ
2365	Rashtibram	2014-04-10	My friends had a similar reaction to Arya's scene: I made the point that she's a really dark and tragic character now, but they were all like "NO WAY!! GO ARYA! ARYA FOR QUEEN!!"

Well in the show, he the smith who forged the swords travelled all the time from Volantis, so it's very plausible that he couldn't reforge the swords until now.
2367	shiola	2014-04-10	Kid I work with: Â I'm really excited for the Dawnish.
Me: The Dornish? Â Yeah, they're really cool. Â I love Oberyn.
Kid: Â Was he the one who tried to bang the white dude in the whore house? Â I really liked him
2368	shiola	2014-04-10	They showed Ice (and Ned) for like the last 10 Seconds in the "previously on" right before the cold opening. Got to think that should be enough of a reminder.


Â 
Please. Â With all the names and plots the Previously On... had to go through, I don't blame the Unsullied for not focusing on the sword. Â Maybe they thought execution was the binding theme in those clips, not the sword itself.
2369	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-10	Jaime stood. â<U+0080><U+009C>I am tired of having highborn

â<U+0080><U+009C>You do.â<U+0080><U+009D> Lord Tywin rose as well. â<U+0080><U+009C>A duty to House Lannister. You are the heir to Casterly Rock. That is where you should be. Tommen should accompany you, as your ward and squire. The Rock is where heâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll learn to be a Lannister, and I want him away from his mother. I mean to find a new husband for Cersei. Oberyn Martell perhaps, once I convince Lord Tyrell that the match does not threaten Highgarden. And it is past time you were wed. The Tyrells are now insisting that Margaery be wed to Tommen, but if I were to offer you insteadâ<U+0080><U+0094>â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>NO!â<U+0080><U+009D> Jaime had heard all that he could stand. No, more than he could stand. He was sick of it, sick of lords and lies, sick of his father, his sister, sick of the whole bloody business. â<U+0080><U+009C>No. No. No. No. No. How many times must I say no before youâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll hear it? Oberyn Martell? The manâ<U+0080><U+0099>s infamous, and not just for poisoning his sword. He has more bastards than Robert, and beds with boys as well. And if you think for one misbegotten moment that I would wed Joffreyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s widow . . . â<U+0080><U+009D>

Â 
I hope some of this makes it into the season. The way Jaime and Tywin's argument went leads me to believe it isn't the last we'll see of that.

This.
2371	RadoLukacs	2014-04-11	One of my friends loved the Arya scene and remarked that Oberyn must be really bold to come to King's Landing with 5 men and "openly threaten Tywin Lannister", but he did not like that Oberyn is bisexual. He predicts that Daenerys will easily take Meereen, Jaime won't touch Cersei again and Arya will probably not arrive at the Eyrie without meeting some trouble on the road.
Â 
Another friend says he decided not to make predictions anymore after having seen the RW, but he hopes Arya will kill Joffrey soon.

Â 
I've seen that too  For some reason, it really really bugs me that people think that's her name. (and that includes most of my Unsullied friends)
Â 


Kid I work with: Â I'm really excited for the Dawnish.
Me: The Dornish? Â Yeah, they're really cool. Â I love Oberyn.
Kid: Â Was he the one who tried to bang the white dude in the whore house? Â I really liked him


Â 
I love this. I always love reading this thread 
Â 
Â 
So my sister was too lazy to chat about everything and just said a few things:
Arya will become a great assassin
Something big will go down at the wedding
Oberyin will most probably have something to do with it
And then she went and said:
Â 
Me: What did you think of the Thenns?
Sis: Who are they!?
Me: The cannibals.
Sis: Yeah, they look tough..... (a moment later) I didn't realize they were really cannibals, though. Thought they put the arm there just to intimidate the others. (!!)
Â 
I know. I'll have to disown her, Tywin-style

I agree - the highlight clips didn't do a good job of focusing on the sword, rather than the executions, as unifying the action. (Wasn't there a scene with Catelyn and Ned discussing Ice that could have worked better?) I watched Season 1 before reading the books, and I'm pretty sure I had no idea that they'd used Ice for Ned's execution.
2374	IlAovatar	2014-04-11	Quite a few people I know are convinced Oberyn will kill Joffrey at the wedding to get back at the Lannisters.
Â 
Also like the prediction that Dontos will end up murdering Tyrion, believing that he's doing Sansa a favour.
2375	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-11	Â 
Please. Â With all the names and plots the Previously On... had to go through, I don't blame the Unsullied for not focusing on the sword. Â Maybe they thought execution was the binding theme in those clips, not the sword itself.


I forgot the sword reforging was going to be in this episode (forgot they named it two swords) so whenthey showed Ice in the preview i was like "wtf" then it donned on me.
2376	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-11	I agree - the highlight clips didn't do a good job of focusing on the sword, rather than the executions, as unifying the action.

There's the scene in the pilot where Ned is cleaning it in the godswood and Cat comes to give him the news about Jon Arryn, but they don't actually discuss the sword itself.
Â 
I hate to say it, but that's sort of an Achilles heel of the show - some of the pertinent details are lost on the viewers because, in an attempt to keep things interesting, they're presented with too much other stuff going on at the same time (Littlefinger telling the story about his duel with Brandon while a pair of lesbians are climaxing against each other comes to mind...).

Â 
Not to nitpick, but I wouldn't necessarily say the women in that scene were a pair of lesbians.Â  They were two prostitutes being ordered to perform something by LF while he yapped.Â  I must say, that is one scene I particularly hate, and I usually FF through it now on rewatches.Â
2378	WakeTheDragon	2014-04-12	They had no idea who daario was that's for sure.

The name "Ice" has never been used on the show, nor the notion of house swords.
2380	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-12	The name "Ice" has never been used on the show, nor the notion of house swords.


Â Right, I'm not sure that many unsullied would have even understood the significance of what sword got melted. I think the opening scene was mostly a nodÂ to readers of the novels.
2381	Red Tiger	2014-04-12	A friend of mine thinks Oberyn will go crazy in KL and Jaime will be the only one who can stop him.
Â 
*Facepalm*
2382	Heir to the North	2014-04-12	My Unsullied friends mostly like Oberyn but since "he's cool, he's probably going to die". Â No bets as to him doing anything else before his demise.
Â 
They keep waiting for Dany to show up, "any day now" in Westeros. Â I really put a lot of blame on the commercials that air the dragon shadow flying over King's Landing for that.
Â 
Everyone loves the Hound, but always refer to him as "Dog" lol.
Â 
A couple think Tyrion is going to turn on his family completely and help Sansa reestablish the Stark House. Â Â
2383	lyanna_maria	2014-04-12	My Unsullied friends mostly like Oberyn but since "he's cool, he's probably going to die". Â No bets as to him doing anything else before his demise.


Yeah, my best friend said the exact same thing. He didn't know who "Oberyn" or "the Dornishman" were, by the way; I had to refer to him as "the orgy guy" *facepalm* He said "he is very cool, but he doesn't seem to be very fond of his life"Â
2384	iheartseverus	2014-04-12	This is in the YouTube thread, but I brought it over here, too, to amuse your family members who keep getting everything mixed up.Â  This is "Recap of Game of Thrones by people who've never seen it."

2385	MoA«t	2014-04-12	My unsullied man said, "It's been established that anyone can die in this series, so my guess is that Joffrey will kill Tyrion at the wedding."
2386	ohpooratlas	2014-04-12	I actually had an unsullied coworker remark on the significance of the swords and he actually asked me about who gets the other of the two swords that Tywin had forged. He correctly guessed it would be Joffrey, but he was irritated because he really wanted Tyrion to have it.
Â 
He also really wants Oberyn to kill Joffrey.
Â 
And of course he does not suspect in the least that Joff is finally going to bite it tomorrow night. So I'm excited for when I go to work on Tuesday.
2387	WTFSalami	2014-04-13	Everyone in my living room: This Oberyn dude is pretty badass, what episode do you think he dies in?
2388	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-13	My dad didn't get the sword being Ned's but thought it was a cool scene. As the credits started I went "Oberyn is the sexiest motherfucker evar" and my stepmother replied, "...he's pretty terrible." The biggest laughs came from the Hound's chickenmongering.Â
2389	Q the Cat	2014-04-13	One of my Unsullied friends asked me "When did Arya become a full-blown sociopath?"
Â 
Another shared her wish for Joffrey: Â "I hope the dragon lady flies over and roasts him with her dragons!"
2390	ovis alba	2014-04-13	I'm so looking forward to the wedding, mainly because of the reactions it's gonna cause.Â 
A unsullied friend and me had a discussion before the season started as he was rewatching the last one and he was basically asking: "I almost fell like a psychopath for wanting a teenage boy suffer really hard and die a horrible death, but he so totally deserves it, is that still normal?" 
II'm seriously wondering how people will react, because upon reading I remember it felt first way too good to be happy about someone dying, but then one started to almost miss him. Although GRRM and I guess also the showproducers are thankfully giving us other people to channel the hate on.

My wife didn't start reading the books until after last season (muahahaha), and she pretty much read nonstop(shes midway through AFfC now). Â And even with both the show AND her reading the books, she didn't pick up what Oberyn said about Rhaegar running off with another woman.

Am I the only person who thinks that would make up for the RW, Ned, and then some?
2400	Heidrun	2014-04-13	DBF thinks that Jaime will kill Joffrey and that Tyrion and Sansa will be blamed for it (he's actually not too far off, it's been hard for me to keep mum)
Â 
He thinks that Bran and Dany will eventually team up to control the dragons, and that Bran will be able to control the Others.
Â 
Also that Jaime and Brienne will be a couple at some point
Â 
He said something about Theon too but he comes home from work at odd hours and tells me these things while I'm half asleep so I can't remember his Theon theory. I think it had something to do with Ramsay Bolton.
Â 
Made even more difficult by the fact that he doesn't know anyone's name.
Â 
"OK, so boy that fell out of tower and dragon lady will ...

Â 
Very true: my Mam doesn't really watch the show, I was just re watching the episode and she knows questions like that drive me CRAZY!
2402	Dilshan Muthalib	2014-04-07	It has been a while since I last read the books and my memory of the conversation between Prince Oberyn and Tyrion is failing me.

The only one who claims it was a kidnapping was Robert. It isn't the first hint.

Â 
Â 
Ahhh yep, my apologies...
Â 
But there were (in the books) numerous times when it was made clear that that 'kidnapping' was a Robert misinterpretation of what occurred. It was made clear that Lyanna did not want to marry Robert and had an interest in Rhaegar. 'Eloping' was made clear to be an option.
2406	Tobin	2014-04-08	All of the sources in this are unreliable: Robert because of jealousy, Ned because of grief, Oberyn because of familial pride.
Â 
'Kidnapped' is the official story since Robert was the King and therefore the accepted final word on the subject.Â 
There are a few other incidents where it is mentioned, but most of those are directly in relation with Robert's view of events and would fall under the 'kidnapping' label.
I don't remember Ned ever saying specifically that she was kidnapped, but then it has been several years since I've reread everything.
Â 
It would have been very possible Oberyn to get a first-hand account from his sister by raven - there is plenty of time elapsed between the 'kidnapping' and the sack of Kings Landing when Elia was murdered.
It hadn't occurred to me before, but the Martells are the only family left that could have proof of what actually happened aside from Howland Reed.
2407	Bratchild	2014-04-08	I believe Ned told good ole' 'bobbert that he had, 'revenged Lyanna on the Trident."
Â 
Or words to that effect.
2408	Envie	2014-04-08	It's all about perspective. To one side (Starks / Baratheons) Â it was kidnapping, but to the other (Martells) it was cheating and abandonment against Elia what Rhaegar did with Lyanna. That's always been one of the biggest unsolved mysteries as well as whether or not Jon Snow might be a product of that rape/love affair between them or not. Rumors during the war were common for everything and of course Oberyn hears and remembers it the way he wants to for his personal vendetta reasons - especially the parts about Elia being raped by Clegane and the children being killed so ruthlessly. Those are generally accepted to be true accounts but again, it's perspective just how graphic or horrific it really was based on which version you hear from which side of the war.
2409	ground_control	2014-04-08	It has been a while since I last read the books and my memory of the conversation between Prince Oberyn and Tyrion is failing me. In this episode when they are talking to each other and when Oberyn brings up his sisters wedding he mentions about her husband prince Rhaegar leaving Elia for another girl, is this the first hint we are given that Rhaegar did not kidnap Lyanna or am I reading too much into it. Â 


Oberyn doesn't say anything about Lyanna's perspective -- whether she went voluntarily with Rhaegar, or whether he kidnapped her is pretty irrelevant to Oberyn's message. Â Also, he doesn't seem to be blaming the Starks for anything, so I'd say it's more likely that he's not implying that it wasn't a kidnapping.
2410	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-08	OP, in show we barely had any kind of Rhaegar+Lyanna clues, only vague mentions of Lyanna being Ned's sister and being kidnapped and raped by R (said by Robert) and Rhaegar being Dany's brother. If (and I mean IF) there is anything that we should know, I think they're just starting to give hints.In books, only Robert says she was kidnapped and raped. Everybody else implies in a way they run away together and even that he loved her. The app says Rhaegar died with her name on his lips. Oberyn, in books, says nothing negative about Rhaegar or Elia being in love with him.So, you're not reading too much into it. They're simply starting to give us all the hints and references they didn't during the past 3 seasons.
2411	Warg Arry	2014-04-08	We also get Jorah giving Dany an account of RhaegarÂ being a stand up guy in season 1 (I just re-watch season one. I think Selmy might have later added to a positive view of R but I might just be remembering the books here.) Which conflicts with Roberts POV about Rhaegar.
And although it's not a R+L direct clue it is still a layered in message.
Just like Ned's honour and Robert making a remark about how rare this "wench" was to make Ned Stark forget his honour. Â 
It's all very subtly being layered in. Which impresses me. But also I worry that those clues will be lost on a viewer who is having trouble remembering who is who.
2412	Black Wolf Smith	2014-04-08	I think there would be little different from Rhaegar running off w/ another women and kidnapping said women, in Oberyn mind as either caseÂ he left his sister because of her.
Â 
There has really been a lack of mention of any resent history thru out the GOT series. It may well be that GRRM doesn't want the show to show too much.
2413	Lady Winter Rose	2014-04-08	I like when producers added that Elia was so fond of her children that she breastfeed them herself, which was unusual. That was nice detail.
2414	Glasgowchivas	2014-04-08	Something I mentioned in the other thread, might be more appropriate here:
Â 


One thing I wanted to talk about; Oberyn's tale of Ellia's death. He tells Tyrion that he'd heard rumour that The Mountain had raped her and then split her in half with his greatsword, which we know is different from the books as he kills her by smashing her face in with his mailed gauntlets - which is also how he dispatches Oberyn eventually in a horrible bit of history repeating itself. However, I'm now wondering if Oberyn's death in the show will be changed to mirror the death of Ellia in the show and he'll be sliced in two by Gregor's sword.
Â 
On one hand I hope not because the way he dies in the book is horrific, especially as The Mountain is "confessing" all the while but on the other, a sudden "shock" death blow, one that cleaves him in two, will be more cinematic, have more emphasis and I can really see it working, especially when the show will really build up that this is a matter of life and death for show favourite Tyrion. Will be intersting to see how the show runners handle it.
2415	Chebyshov	2014-04-08	Something I mentioned in the other thread, might be more appropriate here:
Â 


Â 
Very possible they change that, although The Hound dispatching of that one guy in the tavern scene by grabbing his face and smashing it into the sword I thought may have been foreshadowing. In fact, I thought The Hound was going to do exactly what The Mountain does to Oberyn, but I suppose he's not a strong as his brother.
2416	ambi76	2014-04-08	Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war. And my sister, you know what they did to her?
Â 
Okay, I think I've probably become as paranoid as Cersei, but could this be a big Aegon is FAegon hint right there. Wasn't Vary's whole baby-swap story hanging on getting Replacement!Aegon from his wet nurse?

Â 
Well, you could also read that as Elia being so loving and protective of her kids that she'd go to any length to keep them safe. A wet nurse was never mentioned with the baby-swap.Â 
Â 
However, I had a similar thought to you, but for different reasons. If the baby-swapped truly happened, and Elia was such a protective mother, why wouldn't she go to her daughter, hiding under Rhaegar's bed, instead of staying with a swapped baby. Granted we don't know how much time she had to react, but it's possible they are starting to plant seeds of doubt here.
Â 
Will be interesting if Varys or Illyrio brings up a wet nurse in the show.
2418	'96Buck	2014-04-08	Â 
When Osha takes Bran into the crypts in season 1, I think Bran says that Rhaegar kidnapped Lyanna.


Bran only knows what Ned has told him, and Ned isn't going to tell a young child a story different than the king's version, even if he knows different.
2419	Dilshan Muthalib	2014-04-08	I could be reading too much into this of course. My theory was that whatever happened to Lyanna there was no need for dornish to spin the story, I suspect Elia would have had enough time to communicate with Dorn and inform them of what really was going on and they might know more then we think. Elia,I suspect would have kept her family well informed on the situation re Lyanna hence I thought the use of words was interesting. But than GRRM has kind of got us looking for clue's in every word and I might as well be reading too much into it.Â
2420	Sand11751	2014-04-08	Oberyn is so sentimental about his sister, I wonder how much he was privy to about her real relationship with Rhaegar. If Elia related any feelings to Oberyn, it's still likely he would just feel insulted as a brother that his brother in-law effectively abandoned Elia, his beloved sister, to be raped and die cruelly regardless of whatever high-minded reason Rhaegar came up with.
Â 
Â I keep coming back to the fact that Elia was so weak after she gave birth to Rhaenys and nearly died pushing out Aegon, to thinking of that scene Dany witnessed in HotU. "The dragon has three heads. There must be one more.." Elia knows she can't give Rhaegar children again. Also, the Dornish are rather...free with their sexuality, very uninhibited. I can imagine an Elia, who recognizing that she can't help Rhaegar fulfill his wish gives her tacit permission to a relationship with Lyanna; maybe Elia's love and Dornish upbringing transcended natural tendencies toward jealousy?Â
2421	Le Cygne	2014-04-08	I don't think we can go by show Oberyn.  I hate the thought of the show spoiling the books.

Â 
I've heard this argument a lot, but I'm still somewhat doubtful that this is the case with Dornish people to the extent that it's often made out to be. Oberyn has many bastards, yes, but he has never married, and is therefore, in a more open society like Dorne, free to sleep with whoever he wants. He and Ellaria have been "together" for over 10 years, she is the mother of all of his youngest children, and whilst they do take other people into their bed, it does seem to be "in their bed", very much a mutual thing for them both. Arianne sleeps with Arys Oakheart, and has slept with others before him, but again, she isn't married, there is no legal obligation for her to remain celibate. That's the thing- we see a lot of unmarried Dornish people with no real legal ties sleeping together, we see that they have a much more inclusive attitude towards bastards, but do we see any indication of a married lord or lady openly keeping another lover? It may be that I have missed it, so please feel free to point it out if I have. But I think that not caring whether your spouse is a virgin when you marry them is the same as consenting to your husband to run off with another highborn woman, and have her bear his children, who may threaten your own children's claim. This isn't the same as having sex when you're not married, it's not even the same as having a quiet, private affair with someone else when you are married. It is a very public snub to his wife, or that is the way that everyone- the Dornish included- seem to see it. So either Elia has reasons to consent, and bear the shame for the greater good, or she wasn't consulted/ was ignored.
Â 
I'm not saying Elia definitely didn't consent to it. But I think the arguments used are somewhat shaky. Maybe if we see some convincing evidence that ELIA believed in the prophecy that Rhaegar spoke of, that might be a reason.
Â 
If anything, I think Oberyn's wording is likely a hint that Rhaegar and Lyanna ran off together willingly, rather than Rhaegar kidnapping Lyanna (otherwise he could have worded it to make Rhaegar come off even worse "By kidnapping a girl not yet of age and raping her repeatedly", maybe?)- it's not something that has been referenced a lot since series 1, but it serves as a reminder to the viewers of what led to Rhaegar's death, and hints that it was not entirely as Robert tells it. I mean, you could argue that as Robert is biased to believe that Lyanna was taken against her will, and focus on that side of the story, Oberyn's focus will be on the wrongs done to his sister, and not whether Rhaegar also did any wrong to Lyanna Stark. But it's a different interpretation, one we haven't seen a lot of in the show, though it was definitely hinted at in the books.
2423	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-08	I don't think we can go by show Oberyn.Â I think he repeats what everybody knows. That Rhaegar "left" Elia for another woman, either he actually loved Lyanna or he kidnapped and raped her, he abandoned her with the children and left. If Elia didn't know about the prophecy and such, that's why she could have thought and if she knew, I doubt she would tell his brother "yeah, but don't worry, she's just conceiving another Dragon head, he'll be back".Â In show, we have many perspectives as much is in booksÂ Robert -> kidnapping/raping. Like booksBran -> kidnapping. In books, can't remember.Jorah -> talks about Rhaegar in a positive light. Like books.Barristan -> ditto. ditto.Oberyn -> "He left my sister for another woman". In books he says nothing.I hate the thought of the show spoiling the books.I don't think they're spoiling RLJ, simply putting clues to confirm, deny or confuse the audience as much as we readers are by RLJ (as you can see, not everybody believe the theory and their evidences to disprove it, are in some cases, convincing or at least, well elaborated), and I'm sure many Unsullied are yet clueless about it and aren't yet able to put 2 and 2 together because they can't understand all the clues yet, for instance, the blue rose.Either way, when I return home (I kinda away now), I'll ask my twitter feed what they think, what they can do (I have a lot of followers and I think 60% are Unsullied).
2424	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-08	Well either way you look at it, he did run off and leave Ellia. whether lyanna went willingly or not is up for debate.
2425	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-08	I just asked an Unsullied friend about the subject. He's quite into GoT show and completely unspoiled. I asked him what did he think about Rhaegar, what did he thing about Rhaegar AFTER Oberyn said he run away with another woman and who he thought was that woman.He answered me: 1. Fierce but noble, 2 "nothing, he's a manwhore who fucks everything so, it makes sense he's now with a woman who understand that". 3. Dunno, the Red Witch?. I explained him that it in #2, it was Rhaegar who had left Elia for another woman and he said "maybe Oberyn's sister was as crazy as he was".So, yes. Those Unsullied who simply enjoy the show and don't actually theorize nor think hard and deeply about the storylines apparently aren't yet caught any clue. Their virginity about RLJ is completely intact.
2426	Misnthropia	2014-04-08	So, yes. Those Unsullied who simply enjoy the show and don't actually theorize nor think hard and deeply about the storylines apparently aren't yet caught any clue. Their virginity about RLJ is completely intact.


Â 
Ive got a few non book reader friends and they picked up that Dany was Oberyns sister in law and asked me if the Dornish would fight for her or even knew she was alive. I didnt want to add in the whole Aegon thing so I simply asked about Rhaegar.
Â 
I was as vague as I could be to the whole R+L thing but as above, they had no idea and didnt even mention it.
Â 
I think this was meant for the readers and the show viewers who want to search for more.

2427	Takiedevushkikakzvezdy	2014-04-10	This has probably been asked before, but did the Lannisters officially make peace with Dorne after Robert`s Rebellion? If not, why did Tyrion send Myrcella to Dorne?

Â 
I think Jon Arryn made peace with Doran after the rebellion, and then Tyrion sending Myrcella to Dorne was the way of getting their "support" for the War of the Five Kings. Obviously Doran had different reasons for accepting this, and a different strategy in mind, but I doubt Tyrion would have proposed it at all if things were still unsettled.

Right, didn`t Arryn go to Dorne himself to deliver something?
2430	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-10	Arryn took Prince Lewyn's body to Sunspear. Tywin tell that to Tyrion but he doesn't say if he took Elia's body, or the children's. Also apologies, I'm sure. But that's like nothing, really: "We sorry Tywin Lannister's men raped and killed your sister. BTW, we're marrying his daughter to the King". Robert never went there, either.
2431	juanml82	2014-04-10	IIRC, in the books it's mentioned that the Dornish were in the brink of revolt after Robert's Rebellion, Jon Arryn travelled there and, after meeting Doran, everything was (tensely) settled. Most likely, Jon Arryn threatened to sack Dorne from the sea, Ironborn style (and maybe with the Ironborns) and Doran backed down.
Â 
As for Rhaegar and Lyanna, while it's generally accepted in this forum that they've run together, the fact that Rhaegar loved her doesn't preclude Rhaegar kidnapping her.

Â 
Very true...based on how her personality was described in the books, I'd guess it wasn't a kidnapping, but we'll have to keep a sharp eye out to see how the show continues to drop these clues.
2433	roxWolfox	2014-04-10	I like when producers added that Elia was so fond of her children that she breastfeed them herself, which was unusual. That was nice detail.


My take on this was that they excluded Elia and Oberyn's visit to Casterly Rock where she 'coo'ed over baby Tyrion, and they had to introduce Elia's maternal instincts somehow.
Â 
In the end, I think the link will be made when Oberyn meets Tyrion's bride.Â  He'll hear she's a Stark, and will share some family history with her.Â  He's just that OTT, in my eyes.Â  I can't wait for Sunday!Â  (checks calendar).Â  xD
2434	tsarrast	2014-04-11	The show all but confirmed R+L=J theory imo in Ep1 of Season 4 that just came out last sunday, Oberyn says that Rheagar ran off with another woman. Â This can only be Lyanna - and the show is obviously laying the groundwork for this reveal.
Â 
Additionally Martin rarely does things for no reason. Â If Rheagar went off with Lyanna and nothing became of it - no children, no Jon Snow - then why wrap it in secrecy? Â why all the hints? Â there's obviously something major happening here.
Â 
I realize show /= books ... but Martin works with the shows producers, writes one episode each year, etc... and one of the ways they got the show in the first place was apparently guessing correctly who Jon Snow's parents are... so I think this new episode basically confirms this theory by now providing confirmation from Oberyn's perspective that Rhaegar did in fact elope with another woman.

Anyone denying R+L=J at this point is delusional.

Welcome!
Â 
Personally, I think that anyone who thinks this story has a happy ending is delusional (not to say R+L=J is necessarily one).
Â 
For the record, D&D "passed the Wonka test." Â I'm not aware that anyone has ever confirmed that they correctly guessed Jon Snow's parents.
Â 
Also for the record, Oberyn said that Rhaegar left his sister for another woman, not that he ran off with another woman. Â He gave no clarity as to whether the 'other woman' was a willing participant in anything that happened following.
Â 
After having this same discussion on another thread (http://asoiaf.wester...lers/?p=5625752) I'm surprised at how many book readers heard what they wanted to hear out of words which Oberyn never actually said.

2437	GHOSTSTARK	2014-04-11	It has been a while since I last read the books and my memory of the conversation between Prince Oberyn and Tyrion is failing me. In this episode when they are talking to each other and when Oberyn brings up his sisters wedding he mentions about her husband prince Rhaegar leaving Elia for another girl, is this the first hint we are given that Rhaegar did not kidnap Lyanna or am I reading too much into it. Â 


Â 
yea only Robert thinks of her as being kidnapped and raped. many others believe they just ran off together. i like how they gave that little background there between Tyrion and Oberyn. besides Robert and Ned talking about it in i think S1E2 we dont really hear much after that about their story which caused that rebellion
2438	tsarrast	2014-04-11	iknownothingjohnsnow - whether she ran off willingly or was kidnapped isn't that important... what is important is simply that rhaegar left with another woman. Â At this point it's near certain that this woman is Lyanna Stark. Â Given that they were together - that Robert think he kidnapped her - and that's why Brandon & father went to King's Landing, were executed, etc... Â it'd be just terrible story telling to have this "mystery woman" be anyone other than Lyanna at this point.
Â 
Her willingness to participate is not really the point - the fact that Oberyn is discussing this independently is further confirmation of the event... and the way he says it strongly implies that from his point of view Rhaegar went off as part of a willing relationship... and even the method they are dropping these clues on the show is pointing towards a later future reveal.
Â 
I've also watched a number of interviews ... and I think it's implied that D&D Â correctly guessed who it was - although you are correct not confirmed... but the fact that GRRM asked them that question specifically, and then later decided to do the show with them... and that they specifically bring that question up when discussing that first interview with GRRM... add it all together and I think they probably got the answer right.
Â 
As a gambling man (I play poker for a living) ... i think it's over 90% that R+L=J ... and I'd be willing to lay 8:1 on it.
2439	Le Cygne	2014-04-11	<snip>Ned said he didn't think Robert ever really knew Lyanna. It's what they don't say that matters. If they thought Rhaegar did this horrible thing, then why don't they mention it. The worst Oberyn said is, he left for another woman (that's always used to refer to a mutual relationship). And Ned is saying, you are delusional.

Well that's where you lose me. Â If her willingness to participate isn't the point, then how does anything he said in E01 "all but confirm" R+L=J?
Â 
We already heard from one source that Rhaegar kidnapped and ran off with Lyanna. Â Now we have from another source that Rhaegar left his wife for another woman (presumably Lyanna). Â Isn't Rhaegar a willing participant in either scenario?

Robbard?
2445	Lady Winter Rose	2014-04-11	My take on this was that they excluded Elia and Oberyn's visit to Casterly Rock where she 'coo'ed over baby Tyrion, and they had to introduce Elia's maternal instincts somehow.
Â 
Â 


Â 
Â 
It is better when they changed this.
2446	Rhaquentis	2014-04-11	I'm hoping for more info on the Elia/Rhaegar/Lyanna triangle with the Oberyn/Cercei conversation. I feel like the Unsullied don't know enough about them, especially who is who. It must be so confusing for them; at least I inform my Unsullied friends when needed (without spoiling)
2447	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-11	As a gambling man (I play poker for a living) ... i think it's over 90% that R+L=J ... and I'd be willing to lay 8:1 on it.


I'm no pro, I'd be extra careful betting against anyone who has already shown me 5 kings...

Rhaegar's interest in Lyanna and apparent opportunity to father a child are established.Â  Her return interest, while morally preferable, is not physically necessary.

For the record, D&D "passed the Wonka test." Â I'm not aware that anyone has ever confirmed that they correctly guessed Jon Snow's parents.
Â 


Â 
I think the closest 'hint' I've seen that D&D passed the test was in this video:Â https://www.youtube....h?v=L2p9dRl0yYo
Â 
Here, they state that when George asked them "So who do you think is Jon Snow's real Mother?" ... and they both gave him their best guess after which George slowly smiled and said they were "IN" for making the show.Â 
Â 
Now obviously - they didn't actually say (and refused humorously to even hint) whether their guess was right or not. Maybe George didn't even tell them whether their answer was right or not at that point.
Â 
I think the obvious assumption is that because George agreed to let them make the show, they must have gotten the answer to Jon's Mother question correct.

"Who is Jon Snow's mother?" wasn't the test, it was the question. Â The test was "Have you absorbed and contemplated the material in my books?" Â They clearly passed the test - only GRRM knows whether they correctly answered the question.

Â 
Yes it was the question but also a test to see if D&D could theorize and speculate as well (or deeply) as long time book fans have done. The actual answer probably didn't even matter that much to George - he was testing to see if they had the brains to interpret the story as deeply as he would want someone to do when bringing it to life on screen.
Â 
And I agree the only person who knows if they answered correctly is GRRM himself.

^^ Â this!! Â I've seen this video before and others, and imo you just aren't picking up on obvious clues here if you want to continue believing that they probably didn't get the answer correct. Â They probably did. Â Thank you Envie for the further evidence.
Â 
by the way - when asked "who's the real mother?" - the answer is "I can't tell" ... which implies that he knows but can't say ... as opposed to "i don't know".

Whatever he says, it's definitely not "I can tell" (sounds more like "couldn't").
Â 
It doesn't matter anyway - whatever D&D knew then versus what they know now has nothing to do with the fact that show!Oberyn confirmed R+L=J to the people who are desperately looking for any type of affirmation, and it did absolutely nothing for those of us who care about the words he actually said instead of just what we want to hear.
2454	Le Cygne	2014-04-12	That she went willingly matters, but that expression is used to indicate a consensual relationship. If it wasn't consensual, that would be quite remarkable, and Oberyn would remark upon it. Especially since he's trying to make Rhaegar look bad."My sister loved him... Beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman."She loved him... But he loved someone else.Beautiful and noble, they say, but he left her for another woman. That's the worst he could come up with.

I completely agree with your assessment of Oberlyn's feelings about the situation, I just completely disagree with its application to this scene. Â From the time he start's hearing the Lannister guy sing until he and Tyrion finish talking, it is literally 5 minutes of hammering home the fact that The Red Viper hates the Lannisters.
Â 
The line you quote is 6 seconds out of a 90 second monologue which is entirely about his hatred of and planned vengeance against Tywin Lannister. Â Why do you think those 6 seconds are his focus and the remaining 84 are not? Â Wouldn't logic suggest that it's the other way around?
2456	Le Cygne	2014-04-12	Nobody said they were the focus.Â  I suppose everyone wanted to talk about Jon Snow's mama for some reason, could be we think it's important.

Â 
Just because that one line is only six seconds doesn't mean it's -not- important either. People who are trying to glean clues out of the show and the books have spent years piecing these sorts of brief clues together from the author as well as the show writers. Sometimes they write things in simply for drama effect and other times they write things in as plot tools. The show writers have to be very thrifty with what they write in due to time constraints whereas GRRM has thousands of pages to convey his clues. IF they decided to put that line in there for Oberyn's little talk with Tyrion (which is what this topic is about) then it must have some significance to the plot. Either they felt it was important to show the Martell's perspective on that terrible event so long ago that started a war, or they are hinting at clues to one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in the book. So great in fact it was the ONE question Mr. Martin put under the writers feet and lit on fire when interviewing them for the job.Â 
Â 
Now you tell me, was that not an important six seconds of information (even if it was just his opinion) in relation to the entire story overall? If it was just a red herring, it wasn't a very good one considering the years and years worth of references and hints otherwise.

I'm saying that the point of Oberyn's monologue (and that entire scene) was that he plans to seek revenge against Tywin Lannister for ordering the Mountain to rape and kill Elia, and it is therefore completelyÂ illogical to infer anything even remotely conclusive from something that he didn't say about a completely unrelated topic.
Â 
It was an important six seconds in that we learned that Rhaegar was once married to someone other than Lyanna, and it explained why he was not there to protect Elia or her children. Â Since we already knew that something happened between Rhaegar and Lyanna to spark the war, and since Oberlyn said nothing at all to clarify the nature of their relationship, the only way it is at all important to R+L=J is that it did nothing to disprove it.
Â 
Considering the frenzy it has caused amongst people who heard what they wanted to hear rather than what he actually said, why would you consider that to be a poor red herring? Â I'd imagine D&D are doing jumping jacks right now since they know they can simply head fake in one direction and you guys will apparently run there full speed.

Â 


Â 
Well the only thing we agree on here is that yes the main point of the monologue from Oberyn to Tyrion was to convey a sense of dread that he's seeking vengeance against the Lannisters. It's a serious problem since the Martells did not seek war against the Lannisters and instead pledged fealty to Robert Baratheon at the risk of being defeated by the larger forces now occupying King's Landing. Doran Martell wisely withdrew from the fight even though the Martells were outraged and have waited all this time for a reason (even secretly supporting the Targaryen revival) to get their paybacks.Â 
Â 
However, I disagree with your point made about Rhaegar's apparenty abandonment of Elia Martell as unrelated. I think they are very related and very relevant regardless of whether or not they are Jon Snows parents. I never actually anywhere in my debating in this thread said I believe it indicates R+L=J (though others shipped it via quoting me).
Â 
The fact that Oberyn believes Rhaegar took off with Lyanna rather than kidnapped her is very telling and a very important clue for many reasons revolving around the rebellion - not only because of Jon Snow's potential connection as a possible Targaryen himself but it does add to the excitement.

I wasn't necessarily ascribing R+L=J to you, but the general consensus here seems to be that Oberyn confirmed that Rhaegar and Lyanna's relationship was mutual, which confirms R+L=J. Â That was the context of my earlier comment to which you originally replied.
Â 
I'm going to try to make this my last post on the topic because I'm incredibly frustrated with my inability to adequately convey what seems to me to be an incredibly obvious and self-evident point (that is also not directed specifically at you): We have no idea whether Oberyn believes that Rhaegar left with Lyanna as opposed to kidnapping her.
Â 
Oberyn said "Rhaegar Targaryen left [Elia] for another woman," which you and many others are interpreting as "Rhaegar Targaryen ran off with another woman." Â That's fine, you're allowed to interpret things however you want, but I'm stating as an objective point of fact that you are inferring a meaning from his words that may or may not be valid.
Â 
I'm then offering my opinion that Lyanna had nothing to do with the point Oberyn was making, as supported by the fact that he didn't even mention her name, and that his failure to declare Rhaegar a kidnapper and a rapist does nothing to prove or disprove those charges, as the nature of Rhaegar and Lyanna's relationship (as well as any of Rhaegar's other misdeeds unrelated to Elia) also had nothing to do with the point he was making.
Â 
I would also suggest that, being such a significant underlying element of ASOIAF, D&D are likely to choose every related word very carefully, thus making the ambiguity of Oberyn's word choice more, not less, suspect IMO.
Â 
I hope that's clear. Â If it's not, no biggie, carry on.

In this episode when they are talking to each other and when Oberyn brings up his sisters wedding he mentions about her husband prince Rhaegar leaving Elia for another girl, is this the first hint we are given that Rhaegar did not kidnap Lyanna or am I reading too much into it.Â It is a hint, because of the way Oberyn words what he says.Â  What the characters don't say is meaningful, too. The show did establish that something happened between Rhaegar and Lyanna before. Another little suggestion, and they all add up.Like here, notably, Ned doesn't agree with Robert. He says basically, let's not go there. Oberyn says his sister loved him, but he loved someone else (he left her for another woman, that's not how you would describe a kidnapping).Here's the scene (Sean Bean is so good, he turns his head away when Robert says she belonged with him):Â Ned:Â  She was my sister, this is where she belongs.Â Â Robert:Â  She belonged with me.Â  In my dreams, I kill him every night.Â Ned:Â  It's done, your grace.

Listen, I first found the theory by reading many well done posts by people on this forum - it wasn't my own pet idea that I'm trying to prove to stoke my ego - and the amount of evidence is overwhelming really. Â That's what convinced me. Â Reading logic/fact-based statements which provide sound arguments backed up by tons and tons of evidence. Â This Oberyn quote is but one more log to throw on the fire... at this point, I actually feel the other way around, you have to be looking for evidence that somehow disproves it to make your point (is there really much of this?)
Â 
But, I understand that I won't sway your opinion, no more evidence will - iknownothingjohnsnow you are on every forum page arguing your point... so I'm going to stop arguing with you. Â I will do this, put my money where my mouth is:
Â 
You can have up to 2000$ on each of the following bets:
1) R+L=J
2) That Lyanna eloped willingly with Rhaegar (wasn't kidnapped and forced to go against her will)
Â 
You say that we are grasping at straws, trying to use every potential clue to prove our points... I say that the sum of these potential clues adds up to overwhelming textual evidence, and that you have to be a logic/fact denier (what do you think about evolution btw??) at this point not to see the obvious truth. Â But, instead of trying to convince you any further, I'd rather just take your money... just call it a gambler's habit.

So, let us do that, forthwith.Â  Moving on, lets here keep track of the various times and scenes in the coming episodes where we see Tyrion being ashamed/embarrassed/angry with his family.Â  All of which is the show's build-up to the ultimate whang.
2471	Le Cygne	2014-04-13	The topic of the thread, according to the OP: "is this the first hint we are given that Rhaegar did not kidnap Lyanna"?Is this a hint, yes. Is it the first, no.sean bean is good as ned, isn't he? i'm going to have to rewatch that scene - what episode is it from cygne?He's wonderful! Those little things he does. It's from the pilot.

2472	Dany's Silver	2014-04-13	iknownothingjohnsnow - whether she ran off willingly or was kidnapped isn't that important... what is important is simply that rhaegar left with another woman. Â At this point it's near certain that this woman is Lyanna Stark. Â Given that they were together - that Robert think he kidnapped her - and that's why Brandon & father went to King's Landing, were executed, etc... Â it'd be just terrible story telling to have this "mystery woman" be anyone other than Lyanna at this point.
Â 
Her willingness to participate is not really the point - the fact that Oberyn is discussing this independently is further confirmation of the event... and the way he says it strongly implies that from his point of view Rhaegar went off as part of a willing relationship... and even the method they are dropping these clues on the show is pointing towards a later future reveal.
Â 
I've also watched a number of interviews ... and I think it's implied that D&D Â correctly guessed who it was - although you are correct not confirmed... but the fact that GRRM asked them that question specifically, and then later decided to do the show with them... and that they specifically bring that question up when discussing that first interview with GRRM... add it all together and I think they probably got the answer right.
Â 
As a gambling man (I play poker for a living) ... i think it's over 90% that R+L=J ... and I'd be willing to lay 8:1 on it.

I saw D&D say (somewhere on youtube, but I can't remember exactly which video) that at first GRRM didn't confirm that their guess (whatever it was) was correct at their initial lunch meeting, but that at a later date GRRM confirmed they were correct. If I find the right video, I will post the link.

Right, everyone who agrees with you 'gets it', and anyone who doesn't agree with you is 'clueless'. Great recipe for always being right.
2474	Simon Steele	2014-04-13	After botching Oberyn's introduction by the awful brothel scene culminated with him suddenly, pornographically, making out with the bastard lady when Tyrion shows up, I was like "great, another terrible twist in the terrible show." But then the conversation about Rhaegar and Elia...really well done. Though I don't remember that specifically from the books, I thought it captured the tone of the story so well. Too bad the showrunners haven't been building up the Mountain the entire time, because most non-book readers are all like "who?" when he is mentioned. I think it'll lack dramatic tension when the Oberyn showdown finally comes because of lack of build up, similar to the Red Wedding. Hopefully it won't be so Evil Dead comedic like the Red Wedding.
Â 
But Oberyn's little monologue was pretty great.

Â I feel the same way about Gregor. He's basically been just a red shirt so far [complete with a different actor for each season]. The battle would be more suspenseful if both characters were more developed. Maybe The Mountain will get some dialogue before that episode.
2476	iheartseverus	2014-04-13	^^ We've seen interviews where the showrunners talked about having to 'tone down' a too-violent, too disgusting scene in ep. 4.Â  Maybe we'll see Gregor in action there (although, it could well be Ramsay's dogs tearing a girl apart during his hunt, who knows.)
Â 
Personally, my favorite guess for the 'too violent, too disgusting' scene was this one, from a post over at WiC:
Â 
Littlefinger and Lysa having sex?

Sadly that always seems to be the case on these forums. Disagreeing is not allowed. You have to ignore them and their opinion or risk having your posts deleted. All that does is reinforce passive aggressive behavior in which "You can't disagree with me for fear of deletion therefore I am right."Â

I have no problem with people disagreeing with my opinion, that's what makes discussing the show fun. It's when you guys argue with objective facts that I shake my head.

Â 
It's interesting to compare his conversation with Oberyn to the one he had with Jon Snow on their way to the Wall. Â Tyrion definitely winces when he hears "until your brother killed that king," but responds with "yes, until my brother killed that king." Â It's a striking difference from "I've heard rumors," and "I wasn't there, I don't know what happened."

Â 
Those "objective facts" if I remember correctly were your opinion that six seconds of dialogue in Oberyn's entire speech were not relevant to the topic of discussion in comparison to the rest of his dialogue. Someone quoted you the question that the OP asked and we then politely disagreed with you. Shake your head all you like it's still just your opinion. That's the part that starts to get you into trouble because you insist your perspective on it is fact while everyone else's is simply argument and irrelevant. That's not good debate.Â 
Â 
But as someone else said, let's move on. I'd hate for the topic to be locked or more posts deleted because you keep shaking your head and eye-rolling and you're the only one unable to take it for what it is: important to other viewers / readers but not yourself.
Â 
And again, I'm not a demanding R+L=J shipper who refuses to see anything else. I'm the one that pointed out Oberyn's speech was important for many reasons and that the bit where he states Lyanna and Rhaegar ran off together is equally important for various reasons aside from the revenge he's seeking for Elia and children's heinous murders. I like the fact it's still up to debate and still a mystery.
Â 
The side debate about D&D's 'quiz' was just more conjecture about whether or not the clues we're being given in the show correlate with what we know GRRM confirmed with D&D - not that they got it right - but that if they did, and if GRRM gave the nod of approval, then that may be why the clues (which are also in the book) are starting to slowly seep into the show, particularly this season with Oberyn's arrival onto the scene.
Â 
It's just debate and conjecture.

Placing 'objective facts' in quotes is a great example of the passive aggressive behavior you were just condemning.
Â 
I also went to the extra step of clarifying precisely which parts of my final post on the topic fell into each category - the fact that you continue to misrepresent it as a means to attack me is completely inexcusable at this point.

Â Â  Good post. L+R=J is definitely still debatable.
Â
2485	Le Cygne	2014-04-13	Kind of interesting if Oberyn overstated the depth of Elia's feelings (did she really love him), yet didn't overstate the worst thing Rhaegar did (leave her for another woman).
The official app:
Â 
Elia's section:
"Elia and Rhaegar's relations were amiable, but it was not a love match."
Rhaegar's section:
"He would die with Lyanna's name on his lips."
2486	tsarrast	2014-04-13	This probably didn't need to be reposted after you already had it deleted once.
Â 
The topic of this conversation is Oberyn and Tyrion's conversation, not the validity of R+L=J. Â You're 100% wrong about my opinion on R+L=J because you're taking my comments about one subject and inferring a meaning about another (the irony of which is absolutely beautiful, btw).
Â 
iheartseverus clearly gets it, others of you clearly do not,Â I think we're all quite eager to move on from this particular aspect of the discussion.


How am I wrong about your opinion? Â You seem to be arguing against R+L=J, and if you aren't then what's the point of everything you are doing? Â You are just trying to point out how this bit from the episode DOESN'T prove it ... although it's been independently proven elsewhere and you believe in it? Â Is that what you are claiming here? Â That seems convoluted and somewhat pointless from your end.
Â 
I never said, as you seem to claim in a prior post, that this episode confirmed R+L=J .. it's just one more bit of evidence... like 500th straw on the haystack. Â I believe R+L=J but realize it hasn't been confirmed. Â This is why I said "The show all but confirmed R+L=J theory imo in Ep1 of Season 4 that just came out last sunday, Oberyn says that Rheagar ran off with another woman. Â This can only be Lyanna - and the show is obviously laying the groundwork for this reveal." Â That was my initial post. Â I could be surprised... at this point I don't think I will be obviously, that's precisely why I would be SURPRISED if R+L\=J. Â So that's me saying from ground zero it HAS NOT BEEN CONFIRMED.
Â 
Your next post seemed to take objection with the willingness of Lyanna to go with Rhaegar, and really only that point. Â And that what Oberyn said didn't say whether or not she was abducted or she absconded willingly. Â Fair point. The problem is it actually doesn't contradict anything I said in my post. Â I said "rhaegar went off with Lyanna" ... could have been an abduction or elopement. Â It isn't really important to my point that this adds evidence to the R+L=J fire. Â That's exactly what I started saying in my next post.
Â 
So you quoted me in order to make a point which doesn't contradict anything I said in my initial post, then you even claimed I "heard what I wanted" out of Oberyn's words. Â Ironic, you just did that with me.... and I've shown how I didn't do that with Oberyn.
Â 
So I respond saying that whether she eloped or kidnapped isn't important - because it wasn't to my point - the point is that rhaeger left with Lyanna and they had at least a child that's now called Jon Snow! Â I wasn't trying to make any claim as to whether it was an abduction or not. Â 
Â 
Then you post telling me that I'm losing you here... maybe I wasn't explaining things as clearly as I am now... but I was making a post that was about R+L=J, not about the abduction or not of Lyanna... but since you kept moving the argument to that point, I eventually responded to that... as many other posters... like 96buck who made a concise but relevant post "Rhaegar's interest in Lyanna and apparent opportunity to father a child are established.Â  Her return interest, while morally preferable, is not physically necessary."
Â 
Other posters like Envie step in to basically guard the exact point that I made and we're all making.... I'll repeat again... we all believe R+L=J, we know it isn't confirmed, and think this is a strong piece of evidence to throw in to the large file.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+008B>You respond saying we are allÂ desperately looking for any evidence for affirmation...
really? Â This Oberyn conversation is desperate evidence? Â Many posters immediately chimed in and had the argument you wanted to have, and said that the conversation - despite it's brevity - does indeed help show that Oberyn doesn't believe she was kidnapped and forced to go against her will... after all he calls Rhaegar beautiful AND noble... and merely says that he "left her for another woman". Â I, just like many other posters, think this very strongly implies that he didn't kidnap her... you're right it doesn't literally mean that, but it would be strange to say only this if you knew that Rhaegar also kidnapped and raped Lyanna.
Â 
I personally didn't want to have that discussion with my initial post, which was why your disagreement sounded a lot like R+L=/J. Â But thanks for unnecessarily using my post to try and prove your point. Â Coincidentally, I do believe that Rhaegar and Lyanna eloped willingly, but that one I believe less strongly than R+L=J.
Â 
I was also confused by this bit of conversation: """
tsarrast, on 11 Apr 2014 - 11:20 PM, said:

Well that's where you lose me. Â If her willingness to participate isn't the point, then how does anything he said in E01 "all but confirm" R+L=J?
Â 
We already heard from one source that Rhaegar kidnapped and ran off with Lyanna. Â Now we have from another source that Rhaegar left his wife for another woman (presumably Lyanna). Â Isn't Rhaegar a willing participant in either scenario?"""
Â 
this is one of your previous requotes where it appears you just want to start an argument... how do I lose you? Â I'm saying that her willingness isn't important to to the point ... and of course Rhaegar is a willing participant in either scenario - his willingness to participate Isn't a question - it's her willingness to participate that isn't central to the R+L=J issue. Â Either she was abducted or she absconded willingly - either way they went off together and I believe had Jon Snow. Â That's my point. Â That's what buck96 answered you saying as well. Â How is that unclear????
Â 
And in ANOTHER thread where it seems I was having the conversation you want to have... I posted this to respond to you, which you didn't seem to want to respond there, despite the fact that you are answering every post I make in THIS thread:
Â 
"I just cannot believe that Rhaegar kidnapped Lyanna.
Â 
Firstly it doesn't fit Rhaegar's personality profile. Â He isn't one of the crazy Targarayans... he was bookwormish until he decided to take up fighting... than he became a great fighter. Â All the POV's that knew him well (like Selmy) - all speak very highly about him, especially that he was honorable. Â He's also the crown prince, and a handsome man by all accounts. Â Why on Earth would he need or want to kidnap Lyanna and run off with her? Â Because he can? Â I don't buy that at all - and I don't think it makes sense. Â Sure it hasn't been disproven - and it is what Robert's saying - but Robert is the most biased of basically everybody who discusses the subject - and it seems even Ned doesn't want to confirm Robert's POV on the subject.
Â 
Secondly, Lyanna isn't really the type to be kidnapped and just submit. Â She's discussed as a wild spirit, one who perhaps wouldn't go along with a situation like that - would try escaping, fight, etc... even abort the child in some way if she got pregnant through rape. Â Now this is much more assumption on my part, but I still think some of these things are possible and it's further reason to discount the kidnap theory.
Â 
It just makes a lot more sense that they ran off together. Â Lyanna bc she was of course promised to Robert (who she told Ned wouldn't change - it sounds like she didn't love him)... and Rhaegar bc of course he's married already! Â It sounds like the type of thing that would be secret / happen suddenly / not discussed with others... which is exactly how it sounds when you hear other characters talking about it.
Â 
I'd love to bet anyone that believes she was kidnapped as much as they want at even money that if it's ever proven through book canon, that she eloped as opposed to being kidnapped. Â It just feels rather obvious."

2487	JesterX	2014-04-07	I started ASOIAF from the HBO series and then subsequently went through all 5 books but HBO definitely blew it last night.Â Â In the book when Tywin offered Jaime Caterly Rock, Jaime said coldy, bluntly . . .
Â 
"I don't want your rock"
Â 
I was really looking forward to that line in the series.Â  Don't know why HBO choose to remove it but it was one of the best lines from the book.
2488	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-07	Bit of a stretch, but okay.
2489	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	Yeah I liked that Jaime was standing up to Tywin, but they dropped the ball with that scene.
2490	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-07	I actually liked "What you want?", "Supper would be nice."i»<U+00BF>
Â 
Supper > Rock.
2491	kephv	2014-04-07	The entire exchange was really weak. Also, Tywin's apathy towards Jaime's decision was odd, considering Jaime was his only heir.
2492	Konradsmith	2014-04-07	There may be a confrontation part two later on. I think it's likely in fact. I mean why not put those two in another scene together...they can raise their voices next time.
2493	Blazfemur	2014-04-07	in the books isnt tywin basically verbally disowning jaime? i was amongst people and talking but, i didnt get that initial impression. it just seemed like a verbal spat
2494	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-07	that scene sorta felt flat. Tywin didn't seem super pissed. I was expecting some YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER type stuff.
2495	Dragon of Valyria	2014-04-07	that scene sorta felt flat. Tywin didn't seem super pissed. I was expecting some YOU ARE MY DAUGHTER type stuff.


Â 

That would be a little uncalled for.... Jaime lost his hand, not something else!
2496	Blazfemur	2014-04-07	he was pretty much just, "im pissed, but take your new sword anyway." and jaime was like, "ok..."
Â 
tywin should have said "youll choose the kingsguard over your right at casterly rock?? i have no son..."
2497	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-07	Dudes, first episode. Tywin smashed the Starks by patiently writing letters. Going with the show's interpretation, he has his somewhat wayward golden child back. He's even given him an infinity + 1 sword. He can wear him down...so he thinks. He's annoyed, but for Jaime he has a higher "I've had it with your shit" threshold than with his other kiddos. It's going to escalate for sure.Â

2498	juanml82	2014-04-07	"A man without family needs all the help he can get"
Â 
That has to hurt
2499	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-07	There may be a confrontation part two later on. I think it's likely in fact. I mean why not put those two in another scene together...they can raise their voices next time.

Â 
They might still fight again over Tyrion
Â 
"Now, you're my only son. Take the Rock"
"I don't want your Rock"
"Then I have no son!"
"Duh".
2500	Currawong	2014-04-07	I was definitely expecting a slightly angrier exchange, given that the rift is so important, but having watched the scene several times, I think the quieter approach is actually very clever and there is considerable subtlety in NCW's acting.Â  Sometimes things that are quietly spoken can be just as powerful.Â  Jaime started off just as he did in the book: of course he could fight with his left hand!Â  And the old arrogance - he doesn't have to be up to his previous standard, just better than everyone else.Â  And then Tywin's attempt to bully him into leaving the KG and taking over at Casterly Rock.Â  Tywin has always seen Jaime as his real heir, has always wanted to get him out of the KG, and the last thing he obviously expected was Jaime's very quiet No, repeated the same way.Â  Tywin is just not used to people saying No to him, especially not his children.
Â 
Which made me remember the (invented) Season 3 scenes where Tywin bullied Cersei and Tyrion and both of them reacted angrily and bitterly, and in Cersei's case, loudly.Â  Neither of them was able to say No to Daddy. Â  You expected Tyrion to try to stand up to Tywin, and also expected him to fail, but I don't think show-only viewers saw this coming with Jaime, so I thought that both the tone of the scene and the fact that Jaime does say No, were a great contrast.Â Â  Back in Season 1 Jaime was pretty cowed by Tywin in that (again invented) deer-gutting scene, yet now he has found the strength to stand up to his father.Â  Yes, he wants to stay in KL and be with Cersei, but you also wonder about Brienne's influence on his newfound sense of honour.Â Â  And an interesting ending: the air of casual bravado as he says that Tywin will obviously want the sword back, Tywin's very cutting remark as he disowns Jaime, and the way Jaime just takes the sword and marches out with a 'couldn't care less' air.Â Â  Which you know is going to be hiding tremendous hurt.

2501	Onna Lewyys	2014-04-07	There may be a confrontation part two later on. I think it's likely in fact. I mean why not put those two in another scene together...they can raise their voices next time.
There better be. It may even come right after the PW, where Tywin will actually be sort of proved right: Jaime "fails" to protect the king.
2502	Throng of Mice and Mire	2014-04-07	I agree that this exchange felt flat. Especially from Charles Dance's side. Its not the first time I've thought he played Tywin as far too permanently amused. Â 
Â 
This plays like he's satisfied that he got in a zinger back at Jaimie as opposed to being disgusted that Jaime is refusing to do his family duty.Â
2503	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-07	Â 
That would be a little uncalled for.... Jaime lost his hand, not something else!


damn did that make me laugh.
2504	Ohala Jack	2014-04-08	Well,I haven't watch this book,but I think it's pretty good,Jaime is good at express his mood.
2505	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-04-08	It wasn't as angry as in the book but a few minutes later Jaime told Cersei he's been disowned. 
It was a slight let down but still a great episode.
2506	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-08	Dudes, first episode. Tywin smashed the Starks by patiently writing letters. Going with the show's interpretation, he has his somewhat wayward golden child back. He's even given him an infinity + 1 sword. He can wear him down...so he thinks. He's annoyed, but for Jaime he has a higher "I've had it with your shit" threshold than with his other kiddos. It's going to escalate for sure.Â 


Yep. This is what I'm thinking. Jaime is the one he loves the most, but there is going to be much more friction to come.Â
2507	Clariana	2014-04-08	The entire exchange was really weak. Also, Tywin's apathy towards Jaime's decision was odd, considering Jaime was his only heir.


Â 
Jaime is not the only heir, this is Tywin's tragedy, his blindness, Tyrion actually wants Casterly Rock and would make an extremely good successor to Tywin but his father cannot see the man beyond the disability.
2508	Khal Shaggydog	2014-04-08	The deer gutting scene wasn't invented - it just wasn't Tywin's in the books. That was Randyll Tarly, when he was giving a similar type of "you are my first born son but not as tough as me" type speech to Samwell.
Â 
But it did raise the stakes a bit - as Tywin, the lion, was skinning an elk, the Baratheon....
2509	MarieAntoinette	2014-04-08	in the books isnt tywin basically verbally disowning jaime? i was amongst people and talking but, i didnt get that initial impression. it just seemed like a verbal spat


Â 
Didn't Tywin kind of disown him on the show too? He said that A man without family needs all the help he can get. He was more calm and subtle about it but doesn't this imply that he no longer considers him his son.
2510	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-08	It wasn't like the exchange in the books, but the timing is also off with Jaime being in KL before the wedding and all of that - so I'm thinking there will probably be another similar more angry conversation after the PW events go down.
2511	coatzin	2014-04-08	I actually liked "What you want?", "Supper would be nice."i»<U+00BF>
Â 
Supper > Rock.


Â 
Just as Tyrion response to Shagga or some other savage... "how do you like to die?"...
2512	GHOSTSTARK	2014-04-08	yea was expecting Tywin to be a little more pissed at Jaime. iÂ liked the way they showed Jaime standing up to Tywin though, besides Tyrion is some situations Jaime is the only person to get his way with Tywin
2513	JesterX	2014-04-08	yea was expecting Tywin to be a little more pissed at Jaime. iÂ liked the way they showed Jaime standing up to Tywin though, besides Tyrion is some situations Jaime is the only person to get his way with Tywin


Â 
I agree.Â  I was saying in another forum that Jaime is the only Tywin kid who neither wants, nor seeks his approval.Â  In some ways, you could say it's the other way around.Â  That Tywin kind of seeks Jaime's approval.Â 
Â 
I mean, Tywin is renowned for answering every slight, real or perceived.Â  It would be more than consistent with his character and history to have Joffrey revoke Jaime's Kingsguard status, out of pure spite.Â  I mean think about it, Jaime turned down Casterly Rock to remain in the Kingsguard and suddenly he has neither Casterly Rock NOR the Kingsguard.Â  That's vintage Tywin.Â  Yet not only does he not do that, but he also let's Jaime keep the sword.Â  That reeks of buying Jaime's affection.
2514	'96Buck	2014-04-08	I think the point will be that Tywin currently expects to win this and get his way, in the end, so he's not all that putoff yet.Â  He will be surprised, then, that Jamie's got a little more steel to him now than he had when he set off to pursue the war, and we will see the impact of the travels with Brienne and his psychological adaptation to losing his hand.Â  And THEN he will go off.
Â 
Since I suspect we won't see nearly as much of Jamie traipsing about in the Riverlands as in the book, they have to have some means to SHOW, not TELL, his character development.
Â 
A different relationship with his father than before is a good way, IMO, to do this.
2515	Ser Oromus Locke	2014-04-08	"A man without family needs all the help he can get"
Â 
That has to hurt


Â 
Disowned by your father
Ignored by your lover/sister
Berated by your son
Â 
Ouch.. I guess he only has Tyrion to fall back on. Pretty sure that will work out swell.
Â

Â 
The whole thing with Jaime arriving in KL before the royal wedding basically means that they have to partially stretch some scenes that led to another.
2516	SeventySeven	2014-04-08	Dudes, first episode. Tywin smashed the Starks by patiently writing letters. Going with the show's interpretation, he has his somewhat wayward golden child back. He's even given him an infinity + 1 sword. He can wear him down...so he thinks. He's annoyed, but for Jaime he has a higher "I've had it with your shit" threshold than with his other kiddos. It's going to escalate for sure.Â 


Â 
Yes, agreed. I'm sure this won't be the final exchange they have, because there's so much to come and they'll milk the Lannisters imploding on themselves for the whole season. There will be more, that's why I'm not bothered by that scene.
2517	greywindsrage	2014-04-08	I actually liked "What you want?", "Supper would be nice."i»<U+00BF>
Â 
Supper > Rock.


Â
2518	greywindsrage	2014-04-08	I was definitely expecting a slightly angrier exchange, given that the rift is so important, but having watched the scene several times, I think the quieter approach is actually very clever and there is considerable subtlety in NCW's acting.Â  Sometimes things that are quietly spoken can be just as powerful.Â  Jaime started off just as he did in the book: of course he could fight with his left hand!Â  And the old arrogance - he doesn't have to be up to his previous standard, just better than everyone else.Â  And then Tywin's attempt to bully him into leaving the KG and taking over at Casterly Rock.Â  Tywin has always seen Jaime as his real heir, has always wanted to get him out of the KG, and the last thing he obviously expected was Jaime's very quiet No, repeated the same way.Â  Tywin is just not used to people saying No to him, especially not his children.
Â 
Which made me remember the (invented) Season 3 scenes where Tywin bullied Cersei and Tyrion and both of them reacted angrily and bitterly, and in Cersei's case, loudly.Â  Neither of them was able to say No to Daddy. Â  You expected Tyrion to try to stand up to Tywin, and also expected him to fail, but I don't think show-only viewers saw this coming with Jaime, so I thought that both the tone of the scene and the fact that Jaime does say No, were a great contrast.Â Â  Back in Season 1 Jaime was pretty cowed by Tywin in that (again invented) deer-gutting scene, yet now he has found the strength to stand up to his father.Â  Yes, he wants to stay in KL and be with Cersei, but you also wonder about Brienne's influence on his newfound sense of honour.Â Â  And an interesting ending: the air of casual bravado as he says that Tywin will obviously want the sword back, Tywin's very cutting remark as he disowns Jaime, and the way Jaime just takes the sword and marches out with a 'couldn't care less' air.Â Â  Which you know is going to be hiding tremendous hurt.

i agree. I think they're playing a "slower game" with the Jamie V. Tywin dynamic and letting it grow organically onscreen for unsullied viewers who may have missed how things have built up to this moment. Book readers have to know that there will be a major event coming that should cause a real shakeup in the family dynamics around Kings Landing.
2520	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-08	Dudes, first episode. Tywin smashed the Starks by patiently writing letters. Going with the show's interpretation, he has his somewhat wayward golden child back. He's even given him an infinity + 1 sword. He can wear him down...so he thinks. He's annoyed, but for Jaime he has a higher "I've had it with your shit" threshold than with his other kiddos. It's going to escalate for sure.Â 


Â 
ITA, and hope that's the way it goes down.Â  Even in the books, Jaime was sent the sword after the fight.Â  I'm figuring that they'll have the serious showdown sometime after Joff's death.Â  Hell, with all the show differences, especially in Joffrey, it's a good thing for Jaime that he's dying, he'd have been Barristan'd by his own son, for sure.Â
2521	Shebara	2014-04-08	in the books isnt tywin basically verbally disowning jaime? i was amongst people and talking but, i didnt get that initial impression. it just seemed like a verbal spat


Â 
well he verbally disowned him when telling him...well you can take the sword nonetheless, a man without a family needs every help he can get!
2522	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-08	I didn't understand the "man without a family" as a disowning but rather something along the lines "a man with no wife and kids, with no hand, would need all possible help even to wipe his own ass". Or worst "you stay for your woman and children but they aren't yours".
Â 
I doubt showTywin will disown him so soon. He's patient and will try to find a way for him to do his will.
2523	KeeperOfOaths	2014-04-08	Â

Â 


I don't think this is correct. I think Jaime does want his father 's approval. I don't know why he manages to say no, though.
Maybe because he does not want the Rock/power, so he needs his father's approval a little less than Cercei and Tyrion who want the Rock/power.
Maybe because he can make a living without Tywin, whereas Cercei and Tyrion not so much!! I don't know. It would be interesting to debate.
Â 
I agree, however with everything that Currawong said. I personally loved the scene. All of it. And I think that this is not the final confrontation between these two. I think that Tywin actually thinks that he will convince Jaime at some point. And they will have another confrontation when Tywin realizes this is not true. I don't know what Jaime thinks, though. Does he think that Tywin may come around and accept him just as he is? Very unlikely.
Â 
Loved the fact that on the contrary to the stag scene in season 1, Jaime does have a voice here!!

2524	Janicia	2014-04-08	Tywin takes tremendous pride in his control over each situation. Â He sees yelling as losing control and as a deep personal failure. Â The only time I can remember him yelling in the series was when Jaime was captured and his council was being useless "They have my son". Â Tywin gets quiet angry. Â He could have kept the sword or thrown out threats or whatever, but that risked coming off as petty and out of control. Â I agree with the people that Tywin definitely doens't seem Jaime's kingsguard status as settled. Â 
But at the same time, I didn't feel this scene sparkled in the way that most of Tywin's scenes sparkle. Â
2525	Tyrion's Third Wife	2014-04-09	The entire exchange was really weak. Also, Tywin's apathy towards Jaime's decision was odd, considering Jaime was his only heir.


Not his only heir ... just his preferred heir.
Â 
Back up is Tyrion's children (not Tyrion himself) - which is why he is pressing him to knock up Sansa.
2526	Envie	2014-04-09	Â 
Disowned by your father
Ignored by your lover/sister
Berated by your son
Â 


Â 
Exactly!
Â 
Man Jaime got the bitchslap this entire episode. I really felt sorry for him and I think that's exactly the angle they were going for. It was more spread out in the book and Jaime had a lot more harsh words to say back at his Father (it was definitely an angrier confrontation) in the book too. They condensed it all into one episode to show Jaime's really at an all time low but that this is part of his 'transformation' that many of us love so much from the books.
Â 
As for the scene with Tywin, I thought it was really well done. I disagree with others who felt it fell flat or was too restrained. That's exactly how Tywin is defined - restrained and a simmering cauldron. He's not the explosive type. Sure, he raised his voice to Cersei but she's his daughter and he has much less respect for her because she's simply a marriage tool to him which is what she hates the most. Jaime on the other hand (har har) is his supposed heir and the strong, skilled fighting male whose just lost his hand and a lot of dignity from being captured, etc. Tywin's containing a lot there purposely and I think they handled it right. Having him explode just because Jaime said "No" wouldn't really be appropriate in my opinion. He's keeping it in check because he respects Jaime and probably because he may still believe there's a chance Jaime can just be 'dismissed' by the king the way Barristan was. But at the same time the disgrace of that would be even worse for Jaime's esteem so Tywin probably doesn't really want that to happen either and will prevent Joffrey from doing that. He needs Jaime to step down voluntarily and honorably to be heir to Casterly Rock.
Â 
Also, I liked a previous comment someone made (don't have the quote up) about Tywin refusing to see beyond Tyrion's disability as the much more suitable heir to Casterly Rock. Tyrion has the brains for it and yeah, actually wants that life for himself as a real Lord and not just a disfigured second son.
2527	Arya or no one?	2014-04-09	Dudes, first episode. Tywin smashed the Starks by patiently writing letters. Going with the show's interpretation, he has his somewhat wayward golden child back.

The subtlety of 'without a family' was not lost on me...family being mother, father, brother, sister, as well as wife, children etc.
Â 
Â 
I loved this scene.Â  Tywin's self-control has been nigh-infinite up to this point, which is rather scary when you think about it.Â  He refuses to discuss his decisions (once they're made, they're made) or admit to any form of vulnerability.Â  The man is a relentless, methodical Terminator/Rock who makes Stannis look hot-headed and impulsive by comparison.
Then you have Jaime who used to be snarky, careless and impulsive, going toe-to-toe with Tywin with the exact same icy calm.Â  Gah!Â  Son now is on equal ground with his father, even if the father hasn't accepted the fact.
The mistake the other two (Cersei and Tyrion) made was in arguing with Tywin.Â  Jaime doesn't bother.Â  He just says "No".

Agree. He definitely has a soft spot for him. And he obviously thinks he'll eventually change his mind.
Â 
My favourite part of that scene was when Tywin asked Jaime "What do you want?" and Jaime had a pained look on his face and looked almost as if he was going to actually answer him (and we all know WHAT he wants and WHY he wants to stay in the KG), but then controlled himself and said "supper would be nice". Superb acting my Nicolaj Coster Waldau. I felt really bad for poor Jaime. I feel like if he had told he might have felt better. It would've begun a shitstorm, but he would at least get a weight off his chest.
2531	Illusive_Man	2014-04-10	Remember that Jaime arrived much earlier in the show compared to the books.Â  There will be time for them to have this discussion again, especially after the PW and Tryion's arrest.Â  I bet as the trial goes on, Jamie will be shown to be disgusted by the way that Tywin discards Tryion, and there will be anther talk between them where Casterly Rock will be brought up.Â  That is when Jamie will blow up on Tywin for his hipocracy over Tryion.Â  Along the lines of "for all your talk about family, but you only cared for the Rock.Â  I don'y want your Rock!"Â  I think that is when you see Jaime go get Varys to bust out Tyrion.
2532	Ravi Seaworth	2014-04-10	Remember that Jaime arrived much earlier in the show compared to the books.Â  There will be time for them to have this discussion again, especially after the PW and Tryion's arrest.Â  I bet as the trial goes on, Jamie will be shown to be disgusted by the way that Tywin discards Tryion, and there will be anther talk between them where Casterly Rock will be brought up.Â  That is when Jamie will blow up on Tywin for his hipocracy over Tryion.Â  Along the lines of "for all your talk about family, but you only cared for the Rock.Â  I don'y want your Rock!"Â  I think that is when you see Jaime go get Varys to bust out Tyrion.


Â 
That would be a great scene.
2533	SerJeremiahLouistark	2014-04-12	It all seemed rather sarcastic to me.  The exchange between Tywin and Jamie seemed more comical in the show and more tense and serious in the book.
2534	Heir to the North	2014-04-12	Â 
That would be a little uncalled for.... Jaime lost his hand, not something else!


Â 
Â 
He didn't mean that Tywin would be calling Jaime a girl. Â He was saying he was expecting the same type of response from him to Jaime as he had with Cersei when he yelled at her, "You're my daughter!"Â 
Â 
I liked the scene, but the missing line I thought was going to be discussed was Jamie's remark about destroying "Ice" to make the two new swords. Â Like others here, I do think there will be more confrontations between the two throughout the season.
2535	Owlyross	2014-04-13	Am I missing something, but Tywin disowned him with his line "A man without family needs all the help he can get".
Â 
Totally in keeping with Tywin's character, and Jamie was fully aware of what it meant.

Â

Â 
I took that line to mean: "If you're not going to marry and produce an heir for the Lannister house, you're going to need all the help you can get..."Â 
Â 
I didn't take it to mean Tywin was completely disowning him but acknowledging that Jaime was disowning himself by refusing to do what the heir should do. He can't marry or have children in the King's Guard and that's just the way he wants it so he can stay near Cersei which he even pointed out to her. If anyone's disowning house Lannister, it's Jaime. Tywin simply confirmed it.
2537	EKWatanuki	2014-04-08	Hello everyone! I don't think I was the only one noticing at least one new city that has been added to the opening titles this series. Obviously, I'm not talking about Meereen and the Dreadfort, but an unmetionned one that the "camera" passes over before going over to Essos. And even though I've read the books a while ago, I don't know what city it is.. Here's two links to two pictures to make my point!

Â 
Thank you!
2538	Mr Smith	2014-04-08	Appears to be on the Kingsroad, so my bet is Moat Cailin. Though tbh I didn't think they'd include it, seeing as they've missed passed opportunities to explain it's strategic importance.
2539	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-08	That would be about the position of Whiteharbor.
Â 
Edit: I made that call based on the first image.
Â 
Upon looking at the second, maybe Moat Cailin could be right.

					
					
							Edited by Ser Desmond Wine's Bane, 08 April 2014 - 04:49 AM.
2540	Hippocras	2014-04-08	White Harbour is directly on the White Knife so that doesn't seem right. If you compare it to existing maps the first image is more or less where Widow's Watch is, is it not? Maybe the show I'll use some treacherous cadet Flints instead of introducing the Borrells on the Sisters?
The second image I am quite sure must be Moat Cailin
2541	SkaggCannibal	2014-04-08	I had noticed that too!  And my gues is Moat Cailin, the two images are definetely the same and since it's right on the Kingsroad... Maybe we'll see it used in the next episode, when Ramsay takes it and Roose comes through. If it doesn't happen it'd be quite inconsistent to have Roose show up at the Dreadfort just like that. But then again, it's the show.
2542	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-08	as everyone else has said, moat cailin.
2543	TheEvilKing	2014-04-08	I wouldn't have thought Moat Cailin was worthy enough to put in the opening credits, unless it plays a bigger role in the show than in the books.

I'm assuming (book spoilers, tagging it just in case)

	Spoiler Theon's going to be making a trip there this season. His storyline is obviously moved up a bit
2545	Tanith	2014-04-08	Speaking of the opening titles, why are we still seeing Winterfell? No action there now, and it makes me sad.

Â 
I think to remind the watchers, that the Starks still belong to Winterfill. And Winterfell is stil an important place, however.
Â 
It's probably Moat Cailyn, though.
2547	jonny__bravo	2014-04-11	Just spotted it there on my third watch through, echo what everyone else seem to reckon, first image would suggest White Harbour area, but second given its position on the king's road would suggest Moat Cailin. Hard to make out, but the yellowy area around it would seem to indicate swamp land or water.
Agree with Chebyshov's summation of the role it will play.
2548	VeturKemur	2014-04-11	The online map they have on the viewer's guide doesn't seem to match up completely but shows Castle Cerwyn (if you zoom in) closest to Winterfell on the Kingsroad before Moat Cailin. I can't see it being featured in an episode though.

Â I agree, it seems like #1 is white harbor, and #2 is Moat Cailin. It looks funny because the screen shots are paused while westeros is at a skewed angle.
2550	Rhaenys_Targaryen	2014-04-13	Looking at the official maps, although at first I thought the first picture seemed to be White Harbor, it would be located at the wrong side of the water.
Â 
It seems as if both pictures show the location of Moat Cailin, which would make sense, since it will most likely become important in the future episodes.
2551	Inquisitor Glokta	2014-04-07	First off: To all those who cried bitter tears after the casting, I. Told. You. So.
Â 
Â 
In my opinion, the best character introduction in the whole show thus far.
Â 
Pedro Pascal just nailed it. The scene with Ellaria, choosing the whore. When he hears the Rains of Castamere, to his one liner about 'paying his debts'.
Â 
Â 
Very well done.

2552	Envie	2014-04-07	I thought the scene between he and the two Lannisters was amazingly well done... he stabbed that guy's hand so fast I couldn't see it happening even re-watching it! Definitely sent a strong message to those idiots. Tyrion and Bronn walking into the middle of that was a huge tension relief with the comedy that came after that as Tyrion shook his head no while Bronn nodded yes to Oberyn's offer of more whores haha!Â

Â 
On a less serious note, I gotta admit that I was like :/ when I first saw who they cast, but after this episode I was sold (obviously).
2554	PhoenixFlame	2014-04-07	He's a smoldering, furious ball of funloving sexiness. Crazy like a fox!Â 
Â 
...and he looked mighty pretty with Olyvar. Dammit stupid Lannister chanteuses! I was grouchy when it was clear we wouldn't see how thoroughly Bronn took up Oberyn's party invite.Â 
Â 
Maybe I'm grasping at straws, but I liked how Oberyn and Ellaria interacted a lot differently with whores than...everyone else in KL. Even their preferences were more along the lines of "witty" and "spirited" than "look at dat rack!" Â

2555	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-07	My only minor problem with his introduction is I would have rather him being shown as dangerous BEFORE being shown as having a sexual and lusty appetite. I know Tyrion explains to Pod and Bronn that they need to find him before he kills people, but until you actually see him do anything you don't really know how badass he is. I have no objections to a couple of scenes throughout the season where he is shown to be screwing anyone he wants in King's Landing, because that sexual side is a part of his character too. To start with it though just felt more like HBO needed raunchyness somewhere in the first episode and for me Oberyn being a great fighter is more important to the story than Oberyn being a great lover.
2556	LordStoneheart	2014-04-07	So I loved all his scenes. Brilliantly written...
Â 
and what the hell? Did the showrunners attend some LGTB sensitivity training or do they just not like Loras and Renly but love Oberyn? We finally got a male/male scene that was not insulting or unnecessary. It was... fuck. It was the manliest gay scene in the history of television.Â
2557	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-07	I think he's perfect. Didn't like the brothel scene that much, but it's not his fault: he has to work with what he's given and he still nailed it. It's good to know he's becoming a fan favourite. I'll let him know in our wedding. (you're not invited, obviously)

Â 
One of the greatest things I've read all day.
2559	Aldi_AA	2014-04-07	As long as he at some point tells Tyrion about the time he and Elia went to casterly rock I'll be okay but if they swapped that for this it wasn't worth it.

Frankly I think keeping Oberyn's introduction arriving with the other lords of Dorne would have been stronger.  Adding the brothel scene is fine, but it felt like a second scene, not an intro.
2561	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-07	BTW, I haven't yet seen the episode again but did they switch the Tyrell/Martell rivalry for some Lannister/Martell feud, isn't? Or so I understood. I mean, they didn't say "he/the Martell doesn't like us" but "House Martell dosn't like House Lannister", like they've been hating them since forever.
Â 
(which is redundant because everybody hates the Lannisters)

Â

Well I think it still makes sense, in the books the Martells don't like the Lannisters because of what happened to Elia right?
2563	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-07	Well I think it still makes sense, in the books the Martells don't like the Lannisters because of what happened to Elia right?


Â 
Yeah, but it's not some kind of ancient rivalry in the way people from the Reach have been hating dornishmen since forever. I guess we'll see the T/M hostilities in next episode when they're already in the Reed Keep next to the Tyrells.
2564	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-07	I think he's perfect. Didn't like the brothel scene that much, but it's not his fault: he has to work with what he's given and he still nailed it. It's good to know he's becoming a fan favourite. I'll let him know in our wedding. (you're not invited, obviously)


Â 
He's definetely becoming a fan fave. My family is in love with him already...I can't wait to see their faces after the duelÂ  
Â 
I also liked Ellaria a lot. Indira nailed the perfect balance between seductive and...kind of motherly, which really fits the character.Â 
Â 
Now I only need Oberyn to talk shit to Tyrion like in the book. That special snowflake needs to get taken down a peg or ten
Â 
Also, my gf hated that scene: "How come we have to see the naked whores, but right when the hot dudes are about to get busy some Lannisters conveniently start to sing?!" Those soldiers were such cockblockersÂ

Â 

Yeah, I noticed too that it seemed far more natural than Renly + Loras or Loras jumping in bed with Olyvar. I think Oberyn is a much more convincing gay/bi guy than any of the previous, err, candidates.
Â 
The fact that Pascal has already sealed his position as one of the best actors in the show helps of course. The guy effortlessly goes from sultry and ''in the mood'' to pissed off and extremely dangerous. He captures the character very well indeed, and I already like Show!Oberyn more than Book!Oberyn.
Â 
I also think he highlights one of the show's major, major fortes: being able to focus on interesting non-POV characters in a way the books simply don't allow Martin to. Each medium has their own strenghts and weaknesse in telling this story. You know, that's why, despite my own misgivings over some character's protrayals, I still 100% support the show being done. It's for scenes and characters like Oberyn's.
2567	The Giver	2014-04-07	Yeah, no kidding.
2568	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-07	I guess long hair is out of fashion this season as well. Jaime, Oberyn, new Daario, Pod, Thenns, . All shorter hair than is described in the books.
2569	The Giver	2014-04-07	Thenns?Â
2570	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-07	Yes, at no point in the books were the Thenn's described as being bald, so just thought that was interesting option to go with
2571	LordStoneheart	2014-04-07	Also, my gf hated that scene: "How come we have to see the naked whores, but right when the hot dudes are about to get busy some Lannisters conveniently start to sing?!" Those soldiers were such cockblockersÂ   


Â 
Baby steps.Â
2572	The Giver	2014-04-07	I was just laughing, because you were giving examples of people with short hair, then included the Thenns in the list. Sorry, I had to laugh.
2573	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-07	Fair enough haha, well you can't get much shorter than none at all i guess right. I know it's completely inconsequential and has no bearing on the show whatsoever, but it was enough for me to notice "why does everybody have short hair now? are barbers a thing in Westeros?"
2574	shiola	2014-04-07	Fair enough haha, well you can't get much shorter than none at all i guess right. I know it's completely inconsequential and has no bearing on the show whatsoever, but it was enough for me to notice "why does everybody have short hair now? are barbers a thing in Westeros?"


Â 
They're in a war, dammit. Â Short hair is more aerodynamic for running at enemies.
Â 
Anyway, re: Oberyn... His fucking smile as he explained "there are so many veins in the wrist...". Â Loved it. Â This dude is not one to be messed with.
2575	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-04-07	Â 
Baby steps.Â 


Â 
Guess so. At least Oberyn's pansexuality was handled decently enough. I'm still bitter about Loras though. You do not mess with the Tyrells, D&D!Â
2576	Sarah Lannister	2014-04-07	Niobe was HOT in that scene.Â  That Dornish accent of hers wasÂ really sultry.Â
2577	shiola	2014-04-07	Niobe was HOT in that scene.Â  That Dornish accent of hers wasÂ really sultry.Â 


Â 
I can't wait to see more scenes of her. Â She seems like she has really good potential.
2578	Salad Days Saan	2014-04-07	House Manwoody got their shoutout during the Dornish Heraldry Roll Call.Â  I am content.
Â 
We'll see how the show addresses the Martell/Tyrell rivalry, if at all, when Mace (probably) shows up next episode.Â  Willas apparently does not exist in this continuity, I'm interested to to see how his absence changes things.

As long as they don't make Loras and Oberyn pen pals (or God forbid, lovers) I'll be happy. Or as happy as someone can be in a world where Garlan Tyrell gets the chopping blockÂ

Â

Â 
I really liked Oberyn. Agreed with what was said earlier, I think he is better than in the books. But I think it all comes down to how well he can handle his spear.

2583	lizziebeth	2014-04-08	I'm loving the introduction of Oberyn.Â  In one scene Oberyn is shown to be both very sexual and incredibly dangerous.Â  The hatred for the Lannisters and the backstory about Elia and her children is brought to the fore as well. I had my doubts about the actor, but after this episode, I'm completely sold. Can't wait to see more!
Â 
I do hope we eventually get the story about how they saw Tyrion as a baby though. That was one of my favorite little backstory bits in the book
2584	LordStoneheart	2014-04-08	Â 
Guess so. At least Oberyn's pansexuality was handled decently enough. I'm still bitter about Loras though. You do not mess with the Tyrells, D&D!Â 


Â 
Yes. the S1 scene with them wasn't atrocious but S2&3 gave Renly and Loras the shaft, (put SO intended). Margaery and Joffrey's talk of Renly, Jaime's throne of cocks reference, Loras jumping into bed with that dude, Olenna asking Tywin if he ever hit it and quit it with dudes (huh, apparently he did)... D&D do not have good track record with this subject, but Oberyn this season was great. Props to Ellaria, too.Â
2585	Batman	2014-04-08	More gratuitous nudity where none is needed. Why does that even need to be there? If you want to see it go look at porn! Limited episode time and you spend it on whores when Charles Dance only has one scene.
2586	Montey14	2014-04-08	I dob't understand how anybody can think it's a bad cast just by looking at a still shot .....give the guy a chance while in full makeup and costume....I t hink the Red Viper is a smidge older in the books....but Pascal nails it in my opinion.....even the Dornish accent.....
2587	ground_control	2014-04-08	First off: To all those who cried bitter tears after the casting, I. Told. You. So.
Â 
Pedro Pasal just nailed it. The scene with Ellaria, choosing the whore. When he hears the Rains of Castamere, to his one liner about 'paying his debts'.
Â 


I thought it was a great intro. Â Although:
1) Rains of Castamere isn't really a drinking/whoring song, I'd think The Dornishman's Wife would have fit the brothel scene better and been just as likely to get Oberyn's attention.
Â 
2) Pedro Pascal would have made a better Daario than the Nashville guy, too bad he couldn't do both parts
2588	MarieAntoinette	2014-04-08	Also, my gf hated that scene: "How come we have to see the naked whores, but right when the hot dudes are about to get busy some Lannisters conveniently start to sing?!" Those soldiers were such cockblockersÂ

This is coming, don't you worry. Need to milk the man love for all it's worth while there are characters around into that sort of thing.
2590	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-08	I really liked his introduction; even more so his little chat with Tyrion. Oberyn's theme... it's sultry with a dangerous undertone, like the uncoiling of a viper. Perfect.
Â 
I want a scene between Oberyn and Jaime so bad.
2591	David Selig	2014-04-08	The actor is fine, but the brothel scene was all kinds of stupid.
2592	AugustusCaesar	2014-04-08	The actor is fine, but the brothel scene was all kinds of stupid.


Exactly this. It was stupid and unnecessary. It seems like they are trying really hard to make Oberyn look like a badass.
2593	Brave_Companion	2014-04-08	BTW, I haven't yet seen the episode again but did they switch the Tyrell/Martell rivalry for some Lannister/Martell feud, isn't? Or so I understood. I mean, they didn't say "he/the Martell doesn't like us" but "House Martell dosn't like House Lannister", like they've been hating them since forever.
Â 
(which is redundant because everybody hates the Lannisters)


Â 
The the recent tension between Tyrell/Martell was caused by Oberyn crippling Willas. Since Willas doesn't appear to exist in the show neither does the tension.
2594	A Bastard Snow	2014-04-08	As long as he at some point tells Tyrion about the time he and Elia went to casterly rock I'll be okay but if they swapped that for this it wasn't worth it.


Â Did Tyrion mention that their mothers used to be friends?
2595	LordStoneheart	2014-04-08	The actor is fine, but the brothel scene was all kinds of stupid.


Â 
Could you elaborate? I thought it was brilliant but I would like to see an opposite take on the matter. And you often impress me when talking about things I don't agree with so yeah.Â 
Â 
Â 


Exactly this. It was stupid and unnecessary. It seems like they are trying really hard to make Oberyn look like a badass.


Â 
I agree, and it totally worked. most badass crotch grab ever. lol
2596	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-08	Exactly this. It was stupid and unnecessary. It seems like they are trying really hard to make Oberyn look like a badass.


Â 
I don't see how it was stupid or unnecessary. Oberyn is renowned for his sexual activity and prowess, not just his abilities as a fighter. A "higher class" brothel seems like just the kind of place I'd find Oberyn hanging out in, especially after a long road trip. It established who Ellaria and Oberyn are, their personalities, and a bit of Dornish culture to boot. It set the tone wonderfully for who he is. It's not like it was a full-blown sex scene with an absence of dialogue or character development.
2597	Jinjonator	2014-04-08	Â It seems like they are trying really hard to make Oberyn look like a badass.


That's because he is a bad-ass.
2598	ovis alba	2014-04-08	The thing for me is: Yes, overall there have been some sex/nudity scenes in the show that sometimes felt over the top and too much as a attention catcher, rather than having a good point (I can still not watch the Littlefinger scene, where he "teaches" Rose and tells her about Cat, without laughing  ), but if there is ANY person in the book, where I feel like a scene of this kind makes sense - especially compared to the average amount of nudity of the show - then it's probably Oberyn.
2599	Black Wolf Smith	2014-04-08	The actor is fine, but the brothel scene was all kinds of stupid.


Â I couldn't disagree w/ you more. I think that about perfect as could be. IIRC in the books, one of the first things they did when they got to KL was go to a brothel? Instead of telling you bits and pieces about them, and the trouble between Lannister's and Martel"s theyÂ right out and show you just who Oberyn is what on his mind, and what kind of trouble he will be.Â Like Renly and Loras scene from S1, this didn't use subtlety, and got right to the point. Â
2600	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-08	I think the negative reaction to the brothel scene is due to the excessive use of brothel scenes in the past. Some people are now just attuned to a negative response even when a scene is justified and does work.

Â

2602	Grand Maester Mithrandir	2014-04-08	That was an awesome intro. This Pedro Pascal guy is perfect for the role.
Now I really can't wait for that duel.
2603	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-08	i liked the actor and the actress for ellaria
2604	Clariana	2014-04-08	I was with this casting choice too, as soon as I heard he had lots of theatre experience, you can do theatre, you can do anything. Many of the best senior actors on Thrones were primarily theatre actors too.
Â 
And I keep hearing the quiet throaty insistence of: "Take off your clothes..."

If they don't include that story about the young Martells meeting the even younger Lannisters, I will be seriously peeved, disappointed, annoyed, flaming-fire-and-blood mad.
Â 
So far, Pedro Pascal as Oberyn is satisfying as Oberyn. Â I still prefer the Oberyn of the books, but Pascal's voice is sultry enough. Â Could have done without the meat market aspect of the choosing of the prostitutes; and the gratuitious nudity, but it at least makes more sense than Littlefinger baring his soul to copulating whores in Season 1. Â (LF would never discuss his motivation with the hired help)
Â 
Why didn't Tyrion and Bronn approach the Dornish party on horseback? Â It would have taken Tyrion far longer to get through King's Landing and beyond on foot, or even carried in a litter (while Bronn and guards walked) and it looked funny.
Watching the episode made me wish that GRRM had kept Oberyn around for a lot longer. Â He is one of my three favorite characters in the books...
2606	Raksha 2014	2014-04-08	The thing for me is: Yes, overall there have been some sex/nudity scenes in the show that sometimes felt over the top and too much as a attention catcher, rather than having a good point (I can still not watch the Littlefinger scene, where he "teaches" Rose and tells her about Cat, without laughing  ), but if there is ANY person in the book, where I feel like a scene of this kind makes sense - especially compared to the average amount of nudity of the show - then it's probably Oberyn.


Â 
Â 
Exactly. Â Though I have found Tyrion's sex scenes, with nameless whores and then with Shae, to be well done without excessive nudity.
2607	Death by Cupcakes	2014-04-08	Well, I was NOT impressed with Oberyns debut.
Â 
I think they missed a chance here to really show how dangerous a man he is, instead opting for the "daily dose of sex", this time mixed with some action. Which kind of lost the focus, imo. Instead we now know he has appetites and his lover as well.
Â 
I was more impressed by his talk with Tyrion afterwards than how he dealt with the two soldiers. I really hope the next episodes focuses more on this aspect.

Live animals add to the cost of the production and (while looking a bit more authentic) wouldn't really add value to the scene.
Â 
TBH, I thought the dialog was excellent, but the setting itself was pretty weak -- three dudes standing by a tree next to a road barely big enough for a single cart. Â It did not look like a grand entrance to Kings Landing. Â IMO, they would have been better off saying they were a day or so south of the city, have a small tent set up, and a quick shot of horse and retainers in the background to establish that it was a welcoming party, not just Tyrion and his personal entourage.
Â 
Overall, I'm glad they kept it outdoors so they could keep the part with Pod calling the Houses.
2609	Ser Eric	2014-04-08	Once they introduced the brothel part (which I wasn't a fan of), it was oh so cruel not to go ahead with that foursome.

Great intro, great character. I'm quite sold on Oberyn. Ellaria is quite beautiful and I do kinda like they're shown the basics of their relationship, loving, not married, treated each other as equals. I just hope they mention their kids, that would be sweet.
Â 
I can understand why people are put off by the brothel scene, I am a bit as well, because half the sex scenes on this show only exist to titillate the audience.
Â 
Screw character development, let's have some whores playing with their butts!- That was most of Season 3's sex scenes for me.

2617	Rickeen Stark	2014-04-08	When he tilts Tyrion's head up and is all bad ass. "I'm asking you a question..."
2618	Dornish Beto	2014-04-08	I was a little disappointed in that theyÂ placed Oberyn's intro in a brothel as opposed to riding up with the rest of the Dornish lords. I agree it's more important to show him as a fierce opponent as opposed to playing up his sexual appetites.
Â 
I was hoping for more of a showing where the Dornish were concerned, but I can live with the intro. I loved the back and forth between Tyrion and the main Dornish lord, plus he was the perfect Dornishman.Â 
Â 
I hope that they don't get carried away and focus on the Dornish and their sexual openness. Yes its a part of the culture, but they are much more......
2619	Breaker of Ice	2014-04-08	No way that show Oberyn is better than the book version after one episode.Â
2620	Arak-iri	2014-04-08	I loved Pedro Pascal's performance.
On the other hand, the brothel scene was lacking subtility in my opinion. I don't think the book Oberyn would stab a Lannister for almost no reason.
Also, I pictured the Rep Viper as an older man than Pedro Pascal.
2621	Aderyn	2014-04-08	I knew it. Pedro Pascal simply is the right choice. Wonderful characterisation! Hot, cool, badass, smart... just the way I like my Red Viper served. 
Â 
I too would've liked a more subtle introduction, however... Now it kind of seems like they made him dive head first into the whole story. 'Aaaand here's Oberyn Martell who you've all been waiting for a long time, look how cool he is, you gotta like him! YEAH! LIKE HIM! SO COOL!' Well it really was cool and they didn't make him behave off character, quite the opposite, so I don't mind.
Â 
Now I really got to rewatch his scenes...

Â 
Prince Oberyn Martell is a prince, not merely a knight like Ser Kevan nor a lord like Lord Stannis. Â Oberyn is a royal by birth. Â The other two are not. Â Well, were not.
Â 
Kevan is a landed knight, and yes, Stannis styles himself King now, and he was previously the Lord of Dragonstone, which made him the designated heir presumptive until his king had legal issue.Â 
Â 
But unless memory deceives me, Stannis was never even then styled the Prince of Dragonstone as had been Prince Rhaegar and so many before him. Â Why not, I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t really know.
2629	CrypticWeirwood	2014-04-09	Why upon entering the room with the two Lannister soldiers and their brace of conies did Oberyn casually run his right hand through the rather large candle flame?
Â 
He was showing (off) that he could endure pain unflinchingly.
	He was demonstrating that the Dornish are accustomed to great heat.
	He was proving that the Blood of the Dragon runs strongly in him, conferring greater resistance to heat than which in other mortals obtains.
	He wanted the flame to kindle his own long-smoldering rage at House Lannister.
	He wanted to dry off his sweaty palm so he could draw quickly at need, where said sweat came of manhandling Olyvar, namesake of the Princeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s own dead brother.
	Pick more than one of the above. 
Regarding any prospects of a hot pillow-biting scene between Oberyn and Loras, there was an interview with Finn Jones in which when asked if heâ<U+0080><U+0099>d get any more hot sex scenes this season, he lamented that there was not, but that there was a bit of risquA© flirtation along those lines.
Â 
And truly, what better place to insert Lorasâ<U+0080><U+0099>s forlorn lament than at said flirtation? Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m speaking of the line that in the books Loras delivered to Tyrion, but which could here be used to rebuff the (already buff enough) Prince:Â 
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>When the sun has set, no candle can replace it.â<U+0080><U+009D>
2630	'96Buck	2014-04-09	Â 
Â 
Why didn't Tyrion and Bronn approach the Dornish party on horseback? Â It would have taken Tyrion far longer to get through King's Landing and beyond on foot, or even carried in a litter (while Bronn and guards walked) and it looked funny.
Â 


Â 
Did they show Tyrion walking all the way back?Â  I assumed they dismounted @ the meeting point.Â  Obviously they knew the Dornish party wouldn't be walking, and could hardly accompany them to the city if they were not also mounted.
2631	'96Buck	2014-04-09	Â 
Prince Oberyn Martell is a prince, not merely a knight like Ser Kevan nor a lord like Lord Stannis. Â Oberyn is a royal by birth. Â The other two are not. Â Well, were not.
Â

But that's just a matter of Dornish style. Oberyn isn't any more "royal" than Benjen Stark is.
Â 
Since King Robert "stuck" Stannis with Dragonstone against his preference, I presume he also denied him the style of Prince.Â  Even though so styling him would help paper Robert's kingship as deliberate by his drop of Targaryen blood, rather than as a usurpation (which it is anyway while the Targaryens in Essos live).
2632	'96Buck	2014-04-09	I can't wait for the Mountain to die so they can stop changing the actor playing him.Â  They completely ruined the character after the first season.


He's a bizarrely huge sociopath.Â  That's the whole character, I don't think you can ruin him other than cast someone small.

Agree. They could have sticker to the way the party from Dorne was introduced in the books. I missed him saying his waiting for the "justice to be served". Hope they use it sometime.
2640	Kasporio	2014-04-09	The orcs seemed less stupid and more charismatic. Maybe it was just the make up.
2641	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-09	Â 
Yeah, but it's not some kind of ancient rivalry in the way people from the Reach have been hating dornishmen since forever. I guess we'll see the T/M hostilities in next episode when they're already in the Reed Keep next to the Tyrells.


Â 
Nothing was mentioned about Martell/Tyrell issues, and I wonder if it will be included.Â  Obviously, we know the issue was worsened by the Oberyn/Willas maiming incident (even though the two of them are on good terms, the families ain't), but being as it does go back to the times of Dorne coming into the kingdoms, and Tyrells put as lords over them, I wonder if they will finally try and introduce it somehow.Â  And this IS the billionth reason that I hate the fact they have cut out Willas, not to mention Garland.Â  Ughhhhhhhhh and AhhhhhhhhhhÂ  (yeah, I do that alot, it gets rid of negative buildup, LOL)Â

Nightmares galore, those ideas are, I need to rewash the visual with some Oberyn scenes.Â
2648	WeddinGuest	2014-04-09	This scene was actually pretty tame compared to some earlier brothel scenes, the whores actually are dressed for most of the scene instead of just standing around as naked eye-candy. As opposed to the really gratuitous "Tyrion rewards Pod" scene in S3.The whole scene seemed to be meant to show that (1) Oberyn loves sex but (2) Oberyn also hates the Lannisters so much that he'd rather mess with them than engage in sexytimes. All that isn't too far removed from his book version. It also established Ellaria as being somewhat of a check on his bloodthirstiness.It also seems Olyvar (who I didn't recognize at first and then I was like "oh yeah it's the guy who does Loras in S3"), has been promoted into Ros's old position, as a "procurer"/super-expensive premium whore.About the only thing that annoyed me was this idea that Tyrion is seriously concerned about staying faithful to Sansa. (I mean, later on he even turns Shae down! Though considering that Cersei's spy was just outside the door that was actually smart on his part.) Maybe it's just woobifying Tyrion a tiny bit more before the character starts his downward spiral? One can only hope.

Â 
Really? A crab louse you say? Allow me to take issue with this.
Â 
Whilst not necessarily a man of honour, Oberyn is loyal unto death. He is loyal to his disabled brother, to his deceased sister and to his beloved daughters, but above all he is loyal unto himself. He wants to pursue knowledge? He studies a few years as a Maester (the only other noblemen that we know of who have done that are Maester Amon and Samwell Tarly, so he is in bloody good company, as us English are wont to say).
Â 
He is bisexual and lascivious? He does not pretend to be anything else, he is upfront about his sexuality and very honorably declines to get married, insofar as we know, only the Blackfish or perhaps Benjen Stark has taken a similar decision. Tyrion is comparable but even he gave in to social, family pressure and married Sansa against his best inclinations. He respects his current lover with whom he has been for over ten years and does not care that she is not of noble birth.
Â 
He treats women as equal and loves his daughters. Again he could have disowned each and every one of his female bastards but he did not do so, compare him in this to Ned. He treats them as individuals, he ensures they are educated, he respects that they all have different personalities and helps them build on their strengths. He even sets boundaries, none of his daughters is going to grow up like Joff, he tells them "if you ever have problems with men, don't come crying to me, I have given you the necessary resources to deal with the problem yourself". That is the true purpose of any good education, independence and autonomy.Â 
Â 
Yes I am biased but I think I have provided more than sufficient arguments to say that Oberyn Martell, Prince of Dorne is no louse. Â Produce your own or shut up!

 Â Â Â  Â Â  Brilliant response...not sure how one can categorize book Oberyn as a "real piece of crap" unless they're just the type of person who disagrees with book Oberyn's lifestyle choices.Â  In which case, that doesn't mean he's a piece of crap, just has a different moral barometer than you.Â
2652	Kasporio	2014-04-09	Ok Oberyn is awesome, somewhat feminist, freeminded character....
He's also treacherous, and nihilistic. You're clearly a fan of him. Ok. I'm not, neither of Greg. The duel decided of their fate. That's poetic justice to me. Oberyn was mad about Clegane for killing Elia and her children, not for the sake of all people, including women and children, Gregor had caused. Oberyn, as a aristocrat, probably considered lowborn as nothing more than manure or servants.
The fact he was not heavily involved in his daughters upbringing somewhat shows he really never cared for.
Â 
He is the archetype of the debauched and elitist nobility. He really have no morals, in my opinion, because people like that believe they are not bound by social rules and obey only to their urges.
Your second argument was about his sexuality. It isnt particularly emphasized in the books. He's rumoured to like boys, but its a common way to defame ennemies, true or false.
Confirmed in the show, but as i said, TV Oberyn seems far more pleasant. In the books we are told he was a maester and got bored, and he had his own sellsword company, which shows he is a rather dark character, since sellswords are often bottom feeders or total psycho.
To me, he's just like Cersei, Ramsay, and others, they're cool because they do horrendous things, and justify it with a trauma of sort.
He probably had some redeeming qualities, his family has true devotion to him. But he really had the morality of a louse crab. Who lived by the sword
2653	Dildo_Baggins	2014-04-09	Â 
Turn it around and look at it again. Oberyn is the brother of the High Lord.
Â 
What would happen if someone called Kevan Lannister a 'goat fucker' to his face with witnesses? Or Stannis Baratheon as younger brother of Robert? There would be retribution.

I still dont understand how these 2 lannister soldiers had the balls to insult a prince. They where even willing to grab their swords and kill him. Even if they did manage to kill him ,imagine the concflicts it would cause.

Â 
As Oberyn doesn't have a POV, how could you possibly know what he does or doesn't think about the smallfolk?Â  I have no problem with everyone having their own opinion, but I did notice in your OG post about Oberyn you referred to him as being some kind of killer.Â  Who exactly has he killed????Â  
Â 
ETA:Â  He was involved with his children, where are you getting that he wasn't.Â  There are also differences in the sellsword companies, so I'm not sure how much we can say about his service with them and what that says about him.Â  I think, if anything, his varying activities are supposed to show us that he is a bit of a Westerosi version of a Renaissance Man, IMO anyway.Â

As Oberyn doesn't have a POV, how could you possibly know what he does or doesn't think about the smallfolk?Â  I have no problem with everyone having their own opinion, but I did notice in your OG post about Oberyn you referred to him as being some kind of killer.Â  Who exactly has he killed????Â  He killed Lord Yronwood in the books, after sleeping with Lord Yronwood's paramour and fighting with a poisoned blade
Kasporio, Oberyn joined a sellsword company, hr didnt found one.

Â 
Okay, I just meant that the way the original post was made, and as the poster continues in the Cersei and Ramsey comparison that perhaps there'd be a large body count, LOL
Â 
I do remember the Yronwood thing, but it's also rumor and conjecture that it was poison and we don't really know the total why of it anyway.Â  For all we know, Yronwood could have been a terrible and abusive husband and Oberyn did it for the guy's wife.Â  It's easy to say it's an awful thing to do, but we really don't know the story.Â  That's all, and I was thinking that still doesn't make a Cersei or a Ramsey.Â
2657	Dildo_Baggins	2014-04-09	Ok Oberyn is awesome, somewhat feminist, freeminded character....
He's also treacherous, and nihilistic. You're clearly a fan of him. Ok. I'm not, neither of Greg. The duel decided of their fate. That's poetic justice to me. Oberyn was mad about Clegane for killing Elia and her children, not for the sake of all people, including women and children, Gregor had caused. Oberyn, as a aristocrat, probably considered lowborn as nothing more than manure or servants.
The fact he was not heavily involved in his daughters upbringing somewhat shows he really never cared for.
Â 
He is the archetype of the debauched and elitist nobility. He really have no morals, in my opinion, because people like that believe they are not bound by social rules and obey only to their urges.
Your second argument was about his sexuality. It isnt particularly emphasized in the books. He's rumoured to like boys, but its a common way to defame ennemies, true or false.
Confirmed in the show, but as i said, TV Oberyn seems far more pleasant. In the books we are told he was a maester and got bored, and he had his own sellsword company, which shows he is a rather dark character, since sellswords are often bottom feeders or total psycho.
To me, he's just like Cersei, Ramsay, and others, they're cool because they do horrendous things, and justify it with a trauma of sort.
He probably had some redeeming qualities, his family has true devotion to him. But he really had the morality of a louse crab. Who lived by the sword


I appreciate your civil and elaborate reply. Unlike others

I didnt read what you quoted properly, my bad  But no,.I wouldnt lump him in with Ramsay or Gregor at all. He hasnt committed anywhere near the atrocities they have. In fact, save for the Yronwood death...I mean, he even writes to Willas after he injures him  he acknowledges his bastards and cares for them... meh, i certainly wouldnt say he is as bad as ramsay or gregor

Â 
No problem.Â  
Â 
I think it's really interesting that it seems that Oberyn and Willas continue a friendly relationship in later years.Â  I know some think that means bisexuality, I'm not certain of that myself.Â  Oberyn tells Tyrion that he recently had a letter from Willas and they share many interests.Â  Bisexuality or not, that in itself, shared interests and continued acquaintence, really do make me want to meet the heir to Highgarden before this is allover.Â
2660	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-09	Â 
Prince Oberyn Martell is a prince, not merely a knight like Ser Kevan nor a lord like Lord Stannis. Â Oberyn is a royal by birth. Â The other two are not. Â Well, were not.
Â 
Kevan is a landed knight, and yes, Stannis styles himself King now, and he was previously the Lord of Dragonstone, which made him the designated heir presumptive until his king had legal issue.Â 
Â 
But unless memory deceives me, Stannis was never even then styled the Prince of Dragonstone as had been Prince Rhaegar and so many before him. Â Why not, I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t really know.


Â 
Indeed
Â 
I have no idea why this would have any influence as to why retribution would or would not be carried out though. He was called a goat fucker and his lover was called a whore. Retribution would not seem to be limited to just certain sections of nobility.

2664	Starkfaithful85	2014-04-09	he is going to make all of the non book readers fall in love with the redviper and then he is going to die a glorious death...I can't wait for his fight with the mountain
2665	VladimirDulud	2014-04-09	He's a smoldering, furious ball of funloving sexiness. Crazy like a fox!Â 
Â 
...and he looked mighty pretty with Olyvar. Dammit stupid Lannister chanteuses! I was grouchy when it was clear we wouldn't see how thoroughly Bronn took up Oberyn's party invite.Â 
Â 
Maybe I'm grasping at straws, but I liked how Oberyn and Ellaria interacted a lot differently with whores than...everyone else in KL. Even their preferences were more along the lines of "witty" and "spirited" than "look at dat rack!" Â 


Â 
I must needs agree. And if I said I thought audiences would have benefited from a continuation of the Oberyn and Olyver scene, I would not be wrong.
2666	VladimirDulud	2014-04-09	Â 
He's definetely becoming a fan fave. My family is in love with him already...I can't wait to see their faces after the duelÂ  
Â 
Â 


Â 
Indeed. Would that the showrunners could take creative freedom and surprise us with different duel results.
2667	VladimirDulud	2014-04-09	I can't wait for the Mountain to die so they can stop changing the actor playing him.Â  They completely ruined the character after the first season.


Â 
The latest actor cast is one of the most massive men I've seen, and seems fitting, though, don't you think?
2668	VladimirDulud	2014-04-09	Why upon entering the room with the two Lannister soldiers and their brace of conies did Oberyn casually run his right hand through the rather large candle flame?
Â 
He was showing (off) that he could endure pain unflinchingly.
	He was demonstrating that the Dornish are accustomed to great heat.
	He was proving that the Blood of the Dragon runs strongly in him, conferring greater resistance to heat than which in other mortals obtains.
	He wanted the flame to kindle his own long-smoldering rage at House Lannister.
	He wanted to dry off his sweaty palm so he could draw quickly at need, where said sweat came of manhandling Olyvar, namesake of the Princeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s own dead brother.
	Pick more than one of the above. 
Regarding any prospects of a hot pillow-biting scene between Oberyn and Loras, there was an interview with Finn Jones in which when asked if heâ<U+0080><U+0099>d get any more hot sex scenes this season, he lamented that there was not, but that there was a bit of risquA© flirtation along those lines.
Â 
And truly, what better place to insert Lorasâ<U+0080><U+0099>s forlorn lament than at said flirtation? Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m speaking of the line that in the books Loras delivered to Tyrion, but which could here be used to rebuff the (already buff enough) Prince:Â 
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>When the sun has set, no candle can replace it.â<U+0080><U+009D>


Â 
You've got a fantastic sense of humour. Eggsellent.
2669	VladimirDulud	2014-04-09	Â 
Nothing was mentioned about Martell/Tyrell issues, and I wonder if it will be included.Â  Obviously, we know the issue was worsened by the Oberyn/Willas maiming incident (even though the two of them are on good terms, the families ain't), but being as it does go back to the times of Dorne coming into the kingdoms, and Tyrells put as lords over them, I wonder if they will finally try and introduce it somehow.Â  And this IS the billionth reason that I hate the fact they have cut out Willas, not to mention Garland.Â  Ughhhhhhhhh and AhhhhhhhhhhÂ  (yeah, I do that alot, it gets rid of negative buildup, LOL)Â 
Â 
ETA:Â  And, yeah, duh, of course the issues go back even beyond the Seven Kingdoms under the Targs, they were always awarring with each other, not too neighborly, LOLÂ 


Â 
is there really no hope of seeing either Willas or Garland at all in the series? Mayhaps the present Tyrells are considered sufficient plotwise, but I'd love to see a Tyrell expansion on the series - and a look at Highgarden. The fan art produced is inspiring.
2670	TheSpottedCat	2014-04-09	It was a great introductory scene that set up the background for the character really nicely, imo. But they missed my favourite part. That's when Oberyn tells Tyrion that he and Elia were as close as Jaime and Cersei and Tyrion thinks to himself "Gods, I hope not!". I know, it wouldn't have worked like that on screen but they could have Tyrion crack a little smile or get a disturbed look on his face when Oberyn tells him that. I do so hope this little scene will pop up at some point.
2671	Chebyshov	2014-04-09	is there really no hope of seeing either Willas or Garland at all in the series? Mayhaps the present Tyrells are considered sufficient plotwise, but I'd love to see a Tyrell expansion on the series - and a look at Highgarden. The fan art produced is inspiring.

There is no hope. Tywin called Loras the "heir to Highgarden" last season
2672	Khal Pod	2014-04-09	it was great to finally see some more talk of Rhaegar and Lyanna in the show too.

Â ^ If I was a betting man, my money would be on that prediction. Like Chebyshov said, Loras has been called the Heir to Highgarden in the show, it's pretty unlikely that they'll renege on that statement. Still, I would have liked to hear about Willas or Garlan, though... Though I understand it could make House Tyrell's story more convoluted.
Â 
@Ser Desmond- my pleasure, man. Yeah, this is the most new footage and character-talk I've seen since "A Foreshadowing"

2684	Stannis Bannerman	2014-04-11	So I loved all his scenes. Brilliantly written...
Â 
and what the hell? Did the showrunners attend some LGTB sensitivity training or do they just not like Loras and Renly but love Oberyn? We finally got a male/male scene that was not insulting or unnecessary. It was... fuck. It was the manliest gay scene in the history of television.Â  


I'm as straight as a longbow arrow yet I felt that that interaction between those two was incredibly sexy! Stranger save me! Overall I loved Oberyn's intro.
2685	ambi76	2014-04-11	And truly, what better place to insert Lorasâ<U+0080><U+0099>s forlorn lament than at said flirtation? Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m speaking of the line that in the books Loras delivered to Tyrion, but which could here be used to rebuff the (already buff enough) Prince:Â

Well, maybe not exactly those words, but I had a similar idea where during "flirting" Oberyn comes up with something like "All flowers must bow before the sun" from the books and Loras can answer with something like: "Sorry, but my sun has already set, (so fuck off)."

Â 
Great combination of dialogue.Â  
Â 
And, a good Fuck Off from Loras.Â  The poor guy does deserve to mourn his Renly.Â  They weren't bad in season one, but after that, I'm not sure what the hell D&D were trying to do.Â  I missed the Robert clone, in strength, that Renly was supposed to be, and after all, Loras is supposed to be a very talented knight and horseman.Â  It's a travesty what they've done to those two.Â
2687	Ahri Adaran	2014-04-11	For Oberyn if the Unsullied are already calling him Inigo Martell then the showrunners have done their duty.
Â 
For Renly and Loras yeah, I just don't know what to think about them, with Loras obsessing about clothes in that wedding planning scene with Sansa I was just shaking my head...
2688	WakeTheDragon	2014-04-12	Yep he killed it. Pretty much the opposite of the new Daario.
2689	Kenyatta	2014-04-12	Well, I was NOT impressed with Oberyns debut.
Â 
I think they missed a chance here to really show how dangerous a man he is, instead opting for the "daily dose of sex", this time mixed with some action. Which kind of lost the focus, imo. Instead we now know he has appetites and his lover as well.
Â 
I was more impressed by his talk with Tyrion afterwards than how he dealt with the two soldiers. I really hope the next episodes focuses more on this aspect.


I finally figured it out, meaning why the show welcoming party was more subdued than the book welcoming party and it's this:
Â 
Peter Dinklage is more handsome and charismatic Tyrion than the book Tyrion. So having him on horseback with an escort wouldn't convey the "insult" that it should be. So in order for this to come off as it should, we get Tyrion, Bronn, and Pod standing by a tree picking their asses. That is the only thing that makes sense as to why this scene was so dumbed down. The non-book reading audience wouldn't get it.
Â 
And this Oberyn doesn't come close to the book Oberyn that's in my head. I'll say it again. Oberyn Martell isn't just deadly in deed...he's deadly in seeming. Just like when you see a real viper...you know immediately that it's not to be fucked with. You don't wait to see it kill something and say "Oh yeah, that thing is dangerous!"

Ummm, Oberyn is a thinker, perhaps he was just taking a moment between rage and action to consider exactly how he was going to address the situation.

I also want to say it he conversation was humorous, at least to an extent of Oberyn getting a good laugh at Tyrion mocking himself.  
But they had to get an ass scene in I guess, so a brothel it is.  Didn't mind the change.  As someone said maybe they wanted to show the viewers up front how much of a bad ass TRV is from jump street.

Â 


Â 
Doran wasn't ruling prince yet, it was their mother who ruled Dorne at this point. And it was Lord Yronwood who proposed the duel to satisfy his honour.
2701	Envie	2014-04-07	Just a post to praise the wonderful and intimidating presence of the mighty Drogon and siblings. It was endearing to see him in all his magnificence nudging Dany's hand for more rubs as if he were nothing more than an enormous overgrown cat ... and then minutes later see him snap at her face in an instant for trying to shush him. Wow! That was intense and definitely conveyed the feeling of foreboding we all know leads to much worse than a snappy ill-behaved pet would do.
Â

Also, I adored Dany's 'almost' eyeroll at Ser Joran when he reminded her they were dragons and could not be tamed even by their Mother. DUH.
Â 
Â 
	Spoiler 
It was a good scene though as it gives even non-book readers a great big ominous clue that things with the dragon babies are probably going to get out of control soon as fast as they are growing. A definite lead in to the scene we saw snippets of in the trailer with the child who was presumedly killed by Drogon.

I agree... I don't understand why they would leave off their names - it was such an important part of the symbolism of them in the books and it also gave them more 'sentient' realism rather than just creatures or monsters or pets.
2721	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-08	The Show!Direwolves were given names. It surprises me they haven't emphasised the names of the dragons and shown the closer relationship Dany has with the 'biggest one'.
2722	Bratchild	2014-04-08	Whenever they show Dany with her dragons,it seems like she is always interacting more with drogon. Also,when she was going to sell him to the masters',his cries were pathetic...so I think there is some hint to her bond she has with Drogon.

We don't know that they didn't char it, actually.Â  VIserion and Rhaegal just carried the raw food back to their 'pack,' and last we saw, Drogon snapped at Dany and then made a dive toward the food.Â  That's all we saw--he could have thrown the carcass up in the air and charred it; we just didn't see it.

that bothered me too. it was probably too expensive to use fire effects or something silly like that. I will also continue to be bothered by the lack of color co-ordinated dragon fire.

Â 
Â 


Â 
I did notice the inconsistency others mentioned in that the dragons appeared to be eating the kill raw and there was no charring it. I think I agree that they probably didn't want to add the extra CGI cost of fire breathing dragons and went with just showing them ripping the carcass apart between them. You never actually see one of them swallowing it so it's fair to say that yes they may have then charred the meat off screen.
Â 
Regardless, it was still very kickass CGI and they looked very believable... especially Drogon laying there basking under Dany's caress - that's hard to get just right since she's got to pretend to be petting something and the rest is edited in. I rewatched the scene a few times and admired every movement Drogon made, from his 'craw' expanding as he breathed and shifted, to his claws / toes moving independently. His demanding nudge was perfect. Giant overgrown pet - not for much longer! I always imagined dragons being somewhat like a cross between a dinosaur, bird and feline ...so they did this absolutely perfect.Â

 I wish Dany would have turned around and said "WTF do you know about Dragons?

Not to mention you know for a fact that people HAVE tamed dragons, and rode them into Westeros and conquered the entire continent with them, so what are you even saying? Why are you here?

Yeah I had those thoughts as well "And you know this from your extensive experience with dragons on Bear Isle Ser Jorah?"
Â 
Drogon was the star of that scene. Jorah and Dany were the props.
Â 
Jorah 'trying too hard' fits with the plot of his 'battle' for superiority with Barristan but the fact so many people appear to feel wearisome of Jorah could be problematic for certain events going forward.

Except we know that they CAN be tamed.
Â 
If there's one major criticism I have of the show, it's the non-subtle audience hand-holding that it does on a constant basis.Â 
Â 
A giant death machine just snapped at its "mother" because she got too involved with its meal prospects, we don't need Old Man Creeper to photobomb the scene with his needless and completely wrong observation. Jorah never went to Dragon School, so he doesn't know shit.Â
2753	boojam	2014-04-09	We don't know that they didn't char it, actually.Â  VIserion and Rhaegal just carried the raw food back to their 'pack,' and last we saw, Drogon snapped at Dany and then made a dive toward the food.Â  That's all we saw--he could have thrown the carcass up in the air and charred it; we just didn't see it.I agree , we don't see what happened after Drogon took off after carcass , we don't even know if he succeded in taking it away from VIserion and Rhaegal.It's true the dragons are marvels of CGI-VFX, but I bet the longest scene we have seen is Drogon at Astapor.Other scenes have been quite short.One thing that keeps bothering me , and seems it's been said more than once, "they will never be tamed"... well it's something Dany worries about in the books.On the other hand we know that the Valyrian mastered dragons for 5000 years!That's a hell of a long time.Aegon Rhaenys and Visenya Targaryen had not problems with Meraxes, Vhagar, and Balerion and hey were humongous war dragons.What the hell did they feed them , and put them when not needed for battle?
	Spoiler Remember we have Daenerys and Drogon in Daznak's Pit coming up, there is some instinctive jazz going down betwen Dany and Drogon in that sequence. Drogon does not bother her after taking her to his lair, and even later goes looking for her acting as a protector or even as kind wild but obedient dragon! How is the show going to handle this?
2754	iheartseverus	2014-04-09	My thinking, the way this show rolls (and I'm not being bitchy, I loved the books and I love the show), is that no one will be able to really control or understand 'how to tame a dragon' until eventually (I'm looking at you, GRRM) Tyrion gets there, with his ancient book lore about dragons.Â  Dany knew instinctively how to 'birth' them, but she doesn't know diddly-squat about raising, training or controlling them.Â  It will make for exciting TV, I think, as the dragons spin more and more out of Dany's control.Â  Also provides a Redemption Arc for Tyrion, who, from his book research, knows that the grand mistake the ancient Targs made was to chain and confine their dragons.Â  Good TV coming up, for years to come!
2755	Envie	2014-04-10	I think he was in the scene for the same reason that we got to see Drogon snap at Dany for the first time.Â  To let us, the audience, know that there's trouble ahead with keeping Dany's 'children' under any kind of control.Â  Drogon snaps, Jorah says dragons can't be tamed, and now we know.Â  There's trouble coming.Â  Still, for this show, it was a surprisingly awkward and jarringly clunky bit.


Â 
I agree here. Though book readers already know the sequence of events to unfold with Dany's dragon troubles - show watchers do not. Last season they were still cute little dog sized pets that could barbecue a man on one command from Danaerys ... but this season they want to start it off with a much less confident vibe because as we all know, Dany's story starts to take a much less confident turn in Meereen - and the scene with the crucified slave child definitely wraps that up nicely right after Drogon snapped at her face. Jorah's unnecessary remark was simply a tool to rile up the watchers with the "DUH!" moment most everyone's already agreed upon and that was entirely intentional. I think they purposely wanted people to say "No shit Sherlock!" to their screens because it's obvious Dany's got troubles brewing.
Â 
Well played IMO.

Actually Dragons cannot be "tamed" they can be ridden and used in warfare but that is not being domesticated to make them people safe. Also the scene did help support the growing estrangement that Dany feels for Jorah and that's presumably important for future events.

2766	Envie	2014-04-07	Definite plot hole many of us saw coming miles away last season and wondered how they were going to handle it. Obviously Jon's well enough to be told of his Brother Robb's murder but not that his brother Bran is alive?
2767	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-07	Ah, could he have not already been told off-screen? You know, like how he found out about Robb?
2768	Harry Lime	2014-04-07	Maybe he's worried that Jon will try to go out and search for them, and he doesn't want to get him in more trouble with the Night's Watch?
Â 
Whatever D&D's reasoning, they can probably explain it through a dialogue scene between Sam and Gilly.
2769	Ice Wolf	2014-04-07	They need to include a scene of Sam explaining his reasons to Gilly or even Aemon, otherwise the plothole is simply too great too overlook
2770	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-07	Ah, could he have not already been told off-screen? You know, like how he found out about Robb?


How do you know that that's how he found out about Robb?
Â 
There's your plot hole...
2771	Blazfemur	2014-04-07	in the books he promises bran he wont say a word to jon that he's going beyond the wall, i was assuming that was the case witt he show. its the part in the book where sam and jon have an identical scene told through their respective point of views, and sam was about to tell him, and then realizes he made a promise not to.
2772	shiola	2014-04-07	Yeah, I didn't see this as a plot hole. Â Bran begging Sam to show him how to get through the wall kind of made "don't tell Jon" go without saying, to me. Â With the wildling invasion, Sam can't risk Jon running off on another mission.
Â 
Plus, if Jon finds out that Sam found Bran safe and alive and then let him goÂ beyond the freaking wall, Jon would pitch a proper fit.
2773	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-07	Yeah, I didn't see this as a plot hole. Â Bran begging Sam to show him how to get through the wall kind of made "don't tell Jon" go without saying, to me. Â With the wildling invasion, Sam can't risk Jon running off on another mission.

Â I agree. Every time someone behaves in a way we ourselves wouldn't behave, we call it a 'plot hole'. Its not really a plot hole, its just something we ourselves disagree with. Sam might have many reasons for not telling Jon, including a promise to Bran, the fear that Jon will break his vows again [when he's already in danger of a beheading] and go off searching for Bran, the fear that Jon will hate Sam for letting Bran go North....these and more reasons would likely be rattling around Samwell's head. It might not be the way I would personally have handled it, but that doesn't make it a plot hole.
2774	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-07	Yep, wasn't a plot hole for me either. Sam clearly recognises that although i'm sure Bran and Jon would love to reunite with each other, they are both on very important and separate paths.
2775	Harry Lime	2014-04-07	Also, he might be afraid of how Jon will react. "You mean to tell me you just let my brother go wandering into Wildling, mutineer, and White Walker territory with no protection except for a halfwit and a couple of kids?"
Â 
"But I had no choice! He ... asked me multiple times."

2776	Ser Bran Stark	2014-04-07	Coldhands made Samwell promise not to tell anyone about Bran...he basically put the fear of the old gods in him. But there was no Coldhands and no promise. If the writers have a scene where Sam explains why he hasn't told Jon(like he doesn't want Jon running of again breaking his vows etc.) then it will all make sense. But until that happens on screen it is a huge plot hole for non readers. People who have read the book can make sense of it but non readers will see it as bogus.
2777	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-07	Sam's a smart guy. He knows that if Jon just learns that Robb died but Bran is alive, he will try go and tell someone (who? Well, who knows).
Â 
I think that we're so easily assuming that he simply forgot to tell him or he won't. We might probably have a scene of Jon speaking about Bran and Sam's deciding he won't say anything and later knowing his reasons or maybe Maester Aemon says something that makes Sam decides it's better that way. It's just that Jon already has too much problems to deal with that. After all, Bran is well, as far as Sam can see and he's better not being found out.
2778	Indigocell	2014-04-07	I was pretty sure he promised not to tell anyone.
2779	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2014-04-08	He's not supposed to tell him. Â What would be the point?
2780	eyeheartsansa	2014-04-08	because there are still 9 episodes left. Â Not a big deal.
2781	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-08	Well Jon is in hot water for allegedly deserting the NW, So if he were to all a sudden go "hey guys,gonna go look for my brother,wish me luck" it really wouldn't do well.
2782	Mr Smith	2014-04-08	I dunno why they didn't just include a few extra seconds in 3x10 for Bran to plead with Sam not to mention his survival. Honestly, sometimes they just create problems for themselves.
2783	TheBadboy	2014-04-08	in the books he promises bran he wont say a word to jon that he's going beyond the wall, i was assuming that was the case witt he show. its the part in the book where sam and jon have an identical scene told through their respective point of views, and sam was about to tell him, and then realizes he made a promise not to.


Â 
He promises coldhands not Bran !!!
And in the show , there is no promise between Bran and SamÂ 
Â 
And remember the scene between Bran and Sam last season , he didnt want Bran to go north of wall . He begged him not to , he knew the danger Bran would get himself in , but he could not stop him. But now that his bastard brother is back , he could tell him and they could figure out a way ..
Sam doesnt know about Bran's abilities ,so there is no way of him believing that he is on some higher mission. So Basically from Sam's PoV if anything happens to a kid going off north of the wall , he wont feel guilty that he could have saved him by telling his brother ?
2784	WiDMNDBAMMD	2014-04-08	I dont understand why Sam didnt mention that he met Bran to his best friend Jon?
Because Jon clearly got the bad news of Robb dying , and Sam worries for Bran's safety , why not tell Jon and then they could both think of getting him back .


Â 
How do you know that Jon doesn't know about Bran? Where is the evidence in this episode about it at all?
Â 
We still have the "it's as if I've been asleep for a year and the world's fallen apart" from the trailer don't we? Or did that happen this episode?

Â 
Sam is forced to promise Bran/Jojen AND Coldhands not to tell anyone that he's seen Bran.
Â 
Coldhands says: "The world believes him dead, best he stay that way"
Â 
Bran and Rickon's fates are left up in the air instead of the world believing them dead. Remember? Theon killed all the ravens. His "trick" with the orphans never even left Winterfell except through Yara and her men and now Ramsay.Â 
Â 
No one except Sam/Gilly know that Bran is alive pretty much.... well there is one other person that should have some idea...
Â 
Jon saw Summer and Shaggydog last season. Sure they were a bit bigger than he last saw them, but two direwolves south of the wall that look like his brothers wolves? Coincidence? No.
2785	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-08	God, you guys are exhausting sometimes.
Â 
In the book, Sam promised not to tell anyone.

There is no rational explanation as to why Sam has not told Jon, he has clearly not told Jon, it is a plot hole.
Â 
Regardless of what Sam thinks he would do with the information, it is Jon's decision to make. Â Those of you who think that Sam is voluntarily concealing that information are characterizing Samwell as a tremendously selfish asshole and (for some reason) trying to justify his alleged idiocy.
Â 
The reason we know that Jon learned about Robb and the RW is because we saw him react to it in 4x01. Â Not only was there no promise to Bran in 3x10 but there was also no reaction from Jon in 4x01 - that is a plot hole. Â It is a problem that was created that was not resolved, and now you have people talking about it. Â When you have to create a thread to discuss a flaw in logic and come up with moronic and bogus explanations (e.g. Maybe it happened off camera...) that is a plot hole.

Yep, this is what i'm thinking.
2787	Khal Shaggydog	2014-04-08	There is no plot hole whatsoever, unless you don't read the books, and in that case, most of the TV only people can barely keep track of the characters so they don't realize Sam met Bran, and the Bran and Jon are "brothers". Â Also, TV viewers won't realize just how close Jon and Bran were, when Shaggydog and Summer helped him escape. Â 
Â 
The only plot hole was Jon, in the books or the show, not thinking more about the appearance of two dire wolves at his exact moment of need, and what that most likely meant (proximity of Starks). Â 
Â 
That whole scene in Castle Black was tingling with near misses and withheld information. Â Not just Sam and Jon with Sam's knowledge of Bran being alive, but also the whole interplay between Aemon and Jon, and their potential shared lineage. Â Just awesome.

Things can happen off screen you know. In your way of thinking we could say in future episodes "wait how can Stannis be at the wall, we never saw him travelling there!". Some things just don't need to be spelled out, and one of those is Bran wanting Sam to keep quiet. And for the many reasons in which people have pointed out, Sam is not being a 'selfish asshole' at all, but protecting both of them. It's not a decision Jon needs to make, because there is no decision to make, Jon has JUST come back and needs to justify his oath breaking, what is going after Bran going to do? Nothing but get him hanged on his return.

Â 
Except that the scene TV viewers got last season was Sam specifically saying "you're Jon's brother! I've heard all about you!" and never making any promise to Bran not to say anything. The TV viewers (Unsullied...Sweet Summer Children, what do we call them?) may not to be able to distinguish between Roosey B. and Stannis, but I'm pretty sure they've got the Starks down.

I'd agree with you, but the scene with Sam & Bran left no indication that anything further was said on screen. It seemed to be their complete interaction.

Except that's not my way of thinking. Â Issue->Resolution->Aftermath. Â When the issue is established (or self-evident) and you observe the aftermath, it is then logical to assume the resolution. Â If Stannis is observed in once place and ends up at another, it is logical to assume that he travelled there.
Â 
Ironically, if we take the "logic" you guys are applying to the Sam/Jon/Bran situation, it would be the equivalent of observing Stannis in one place and then (for no reason whatsoever) assuming that he both travelled to and is currently located in a completely different place despite having no evidentiary basis for either conclusion.
Â 




And for the many reasons in which people have pointed out, Sam is not being a 'selfish asshole' at all, but protecting both of them. It's not a decision Jon needs to make, because there is no decision to make, Jon has JUST come back and needs to justify his oath breaking, what is going after Bran going to do? Nothing but get him hanged on his return.




Â 
And I'm sorry, but Sam has no right to make that decision for Jon and doing so would make him a selfish asshole. Â Selfish because it is not his place to decide how Jon gets to live his life (even if they are both brothers of the Night's Watch) or what information about his family he is permitted to have. Â An asshole because (1) he assumes that Jon can't be trusted to reach the same "correct" decision that he did and (2) because Jon is just as likely to make a rash decision based on the fact that he no longer has any brothers than he would trying to save the presumed half-brother who is still alive and potentially in peril.
Â 
They were right to go after Jon when he abandoned the Wall following Ned's death. Â It would have been wrong not to tell Jon about Ned's death out of fear that he would abandon the Wall (which is the rough equivalent of what you guys are proposing here).

Welcome to the forums and a great first post, Thanks!
Â 
"He found out off screen" about Bran seems to be a bit weak though. Hopefully there will at least be a mention of it with Sam at some point in the future because with him knowing what is out there, its a big issue that anyone is going North at all.

It turns out that Sam made no such decision. As was linked just above, Kit revealed in an interview that he was told about Bran being North of the Wall "Off Screen". Several million people watch the show. Only a couple of thousand have seen that interview. An on-screen acknowledgment by Jon that he knows really should be made, and soon, to prevent several million people having to ask the question.
2798	IlAovatar	2014-04-08	1. Some kind of promise of secrecy may have been implied, even if we didn't witness it clearly in dialogue.
2. Sam may fear for himself if Jon finds out that he not only allowed his crippled brother to go beyond the wall, but showed them the way.
3. Sam may fear that Jon going after them would jeapardize Bran's mission.
4. Sam may fear that Jon going after them may jeapardize the Watch without his leadership.
5. Sam may not have found the right words yet, despite planning to tell Jon. With news about Robb and Jon under interrogation, the timing may not be right.
Â 
All perfectly plausible explanations.

Â  Correct, not to mention that Jon at this point Jon is dangerously close to losing his head for 'breaking his vows' as it is. Sam may suspect that Jon would go looking for Bran, thus breaking his vows again, and probably paying for this 'crime' with death. This is only a plot hole to a mind unable to see the viewpoint of others. But as someone said above, it appears that Jon WAS told after all.

Perhaps your aversion to my use of the term 'plot hole' is that you clearly have no idea what it means?
Â 
Less than 30 minutes ago you were declaring that one version of events had occurred, based on information presented in the show.

Â No, I did no such thing, lol.Â  Also, by 'malleability' you seem to mean 'the ability to change ones thoughts due to new information". You should try it. And it appears, the way you are willfully remaining ignorant to all the sound explanations for why Sam might not have told Jon, it is actually you who misses the definition of 'plot hole'. But nice try.

Â 
I think the assumption is that it's going to be brought up during this season. Also TV viewers might just assume Sam told Jon, because why wouldn't he? Show!Sam had no reason not to.Â 
Â 
Obviously until it's made explicit on the show, it's not good storytelling, but that interview shows tells us that the writers didn't let Sam's lack of promise to Bran hang there in limbo. They made a decision to have Show!Jon know about Bran's location, so it's not a plot-hole. And if Kit's saying it in an interview, then it will probably make it into the show's dialogue at some point.Â
2806	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-08	Â 
I think the assumption is that it's going to be brought up during this season.Â 


Â 
A fair assumption. Kit and John (Sam) have both read the books so I am confident that they were part of a production discussion about the issues of not having Coldhands involved. Given the limited time for the scene, Jon's reaction to Robb's death was by the most important point that had to be given exposure.
Â 
I disagree however about saying that just because a character knows, then it isn't an issue. It is an issue until the audience knows.
2807	Cyvasse Khal	2014-04-08	First off, thanks Jenny for posting that link. Cleared up one bit of discussion as Kit is far more in the know than any of us are.
Â 
I still stand by that the audience would not have needed to see an on-screen promise for Sam to keep quiet as there have been about 7 or 8 legitimate reasons mentioned on why Sam shouldn't tell him anyway, or an on-screen Jon being told about Bran because simply Jon has a host of different crap he needs to worry about more anyway and he is one mis-step away from Thorne ending his watch.
Â 
If Jon had been told like Kit reckons. I can't decide whether he's maturing more than I give him credit for, or it's just out of character. We as an audience recognises that there's not too much that he can do about that situation and with that knowledge. Yet a pre-wilding Jon would be like "screw my vows, I'm out of here, going to find Bran, take him back to Castle Black and then go and avenge Robb."

Â 


Â 
I really cannot understand that position.Â 
Â 
The actor knows - great!
The character knows - great!
The audience has to guess between at least 7-8 possible scenarios as to whether the character knows or not?Â

I'm just saying it isn't a "plot-hole," but rather a change to the plot, which will (hopefully) be made explicitly.

The actor knows - great!
The character knows - great!
The audience has to guess between at least 7-8 possible scenarios as to whether the character knows or not?Â 


That's right because it is that much of a non-issue (despite some people claiming it's the biggest plot-hole since Doc from Back to the Future not realising he has a 59 seconds margin of error for a 1 second lightning strike) about whether Jon knows or doesn't know about Bran that the audience doesn't need to know. It doesn't drive the plot forwards at all, in the slightest. There's a difference between the character who is in the world 24/7 to the audience who gets about 5 mins of dialogue from each story an episode. I personally think it's fine that they chose not to include a few of those precious screen time minutes of Jon getting told about Bran and Sam/Jon rationalising what that info means to him.

Â 
Ahhh yep. Thanks for the clarification. All the situation needs is an acknowledgement by Jon that he knows and the awareness that the Wildling attack means he cannot even hope to pursue. It will work fine. A Bran/Sam promise would be better but it isn't a broken situation unless they never make recognition in the show (or delay for too long).

If it doesn't matter in the slightest whether or not Jon knows about Bran, then there weren't 7 or 8 legitimate reasons why Sam shouldn't tell him.

Â Well, we have the benefit of hindsight from the novels, so we know ultimately it doesn't matter in the slightest. A character without that hindsight has legitimate reasons though. There were plenty. You're just ignoring them. One of the best reasons is the one mentioned above: Jon is already dangerously close to being beheaded for breaking vows. Sam would know that if he tells Jon about Bran, there's a good chance Jon would go in search of him, thus making his beheading by the Night's Watch an almost certainty. Perfectly legitimate reason, once you expand your mind into what the characters might be thinking. However,Â even with aÂ Â legitimate reasonÂ it seemsÂ Sam decided to tell Jon anyway.

2816	Blazfemur	2014-04-08	Perhaps your aversion to my use of the term 'plot hole' is that you clearly have no idea what it means?
Â 
Less than 30 minutes ago you were declaring that one version of events had occurred, based on information presented in the show. Â Now, based on extraneousÂ information from a completely separate source, you are declaring the exact opposite. Â I applaud your malleability, but I'm afraid you can't have it both ways.

Those two things are not one in the same. It is not an issue that Jon does/doesn't about Bran because he simply can't do anything about it anyway rgardless of what his reaction to it would be, and yes from hindsight from reading the novels we know it doesn't impact the plot so something so trivial being masqueraded as a plot-hole should not need to be included.
Â 
Sam as a character is in a similar position as what the audience is in, in realising that there's host of reasons why he shouldn't say anything. But apparently he did off screen, and maybe that off screen conversation also involved talking Jon out of doing something dumb. If that's the case, cool nice one Sam, good choice Jon, didn't need to see it, now we can move on to bigger issues.
2818	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-08	Â However, that's a legitimate reason IF Sam decided not to tell Jon, which it looks like he may have anyway.


Â 
Yep, he has been told, so that point is moot.

And that 'pothole patching' will come in the form of the tv watchers hopefully realising in the upcoming episodes it doesn't really matter anyway. I think even with not knowing how the plot progresses from here, if I solely just watched the show and felt a detail was omitted, my first instinct would be to just assume it wasn't integral to the plot anyway, rather than lament on how much of a screw up it apparently is.
Â 
That's I guess an easy position to take admittedly, and as was said it's good if it gets the tv only watchers to think harder about what's going on and ask questions, and talk about whether they agree with a decision of a character. Calling it a plot-hole though is just using that term incorrectly.

Â 
The show has 50 minutes to explain stuff each episode. We don't need to see a conversation about Sam telling Jon that he saw his brother because the audience saw Sam and Bran meet last season. The audience has seen Jon and Sam being friends that talk about everything since season one.
Â 
and perhaps the show is "trolling" the "know it all book readers" .... did Sam tell him? Does Jon know? What is going on I can't figure anything out unless I read it or it is explicitly stated in the show.
Â 
Maybe the audience is suppose to wonder if Jon knows about where his brother is or not at this point in the season.

Yes. Last season episode 9 titled the Rains of Castamere. Jon Snow is told by the wildlings to kill the old man, he refuses and starts fighting the wildlings, Bran wargs into Summer and attacks the wildlings. Jon Snow sees Summer and Shaggydog attacking wildlings which aids him in his escape from them.
Â 
Is it hard to believe that any conversation between Sam and Jon Snow is going to include what Jon went through including how he saw two direwolves and how Sam met Bran?
Â 
I mean some time has passed clearly. Jon's wounds are "healed" and Ygritte/Tormond are waiting for a response from Mance which "the man" was sent quite awhile ago and should be back with "word" on their "orders"
Â 
and finally reason for Coldhands/Bran/Jojen's promise was cut from the show, Bran is not thought to be dead to the world, like the books. This is not a plot hole, it is plot divergence.Â

John seeing Direwolves south of the wall does not lead to a rational conclusion that he now 'knows' Bran is North of the Wall.
Â 
Is it hard to believe that any conversation between Sam and Jon Snow is going to include what Jon went through including how he saw two direwolves and how Sam met Bran?

No, it isn't hard to believe. It just involves having reason to accept that such a thing took place.

Yep - hence why I describe it a a bit of pothole in the road instead of the grand canyon - sized issue that some were leading towards. It isn't a massive issue at all. But it isn't non-existentÂ either. As I have said previously a number of times, I am confident they will spend a moment to address, but if they don't, well it will just be a lesser annoyance compared to some of the previous issues with the story at the wall.

2830	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-04-09	Is there any reason they would have told Jon about Robb but not Bran and Rickon? Â In the books Jon returns to Castle Black before the RW, so the only news they had to break to him was that Theon sacked Winterfell and his half-brothers are dead (which is when he remembers the direwolf and wonders if Bran was warging from beyond the grave).
Â 
From an adaptation standpoint it might be better for the viewers to have the scene we'll presumably see in one of the next few episodes:
Â 
Janos Slynt: Sorry about that whole 'trying to have you killed' thing, Jon. Â By the way, your daddy's ward torched your hometown and murdered your OBGYN. Â Oh yeah, and your little brothers too. Â You know, the crippled one and... uh... Oliver Twist.
Â 
Big Fudge Tarly: What? Â Dead? Â No they're not. Â I just saw them a few weeks ago. Â We were all hanging out at the Nightfort together. Â We ordered pizza and watched reruns of Three's Company.
Â 
Â 
Or perhaps some variation of that. Â I think it's a fine producorial decision, I just for the life of me can't think of a reason why they'd have already told him about 1 tragedy but not the other.

I agree with most of this, but I think we need to find out at some point, because it will have strong implications for what Jon does with Stannis's offer to him. Book!Jon would never have even considered it if he thought Bran was alive. I don't think we need an entire conversation devoted to it...maybe just Jon making a remark to Sam like "who knows how long he'll survive North of the Wall" or something along those lines.Â

If they cut out Stannis's offer (unlikely), then perhaps we don't need clarification ever.

That the people who are least thought of in this series: bastards, criminals, broken men, people who are told they won't amount to anything, are the ones who keep their promises and vows. They end up beheaded, on the wall, being called kingslayer, etc. I guess sam makes jon sticking to his vows not seem as unusual as it apparantly is.Some people always keep their promises, no matter what.

No - I understand your point.Â  However you are missing mine - if the author states there is no one in the room and at that time says Person B says his last words are "XXÂ  YY" then there is a plot hole becauseÂ there was no one there to hear them.Â  There's no one hiding in the corner, no one on the other side of the door, there is no one.Â  There isn't previous conversation to reference.

Â 
Â 
Thanks to JennyT we know that Sam will tell Jon eventually,Â we just don't know why he hasn't yet (or why the show hasn't addressed it yet if he already has).

Sure we do there's 54 minutes in an episode, they surely can't fit everything in there.
Â 
and people that only watch the show have no reason to assume that Jon doesn't know about his brother or that Sam is not going to tell him.
Â 
Jon would rather talk about his dead one first? Seems understandable.

OK, allow me to rephrase my comment: We don't yet have a reason which doesn't boil down to "the writers are bad and the viewers are stupid."
Â 
Better?
Â 
By the way, at this point there are about a dozen people in all of Westeros who know that Bran and Rickon weren't murdered by Theon, so it's really not understandable that Sam would fail to tell him or that Robb would have no reaction to the news. Â Kind of funny that my unsullied brother figured that out and you didn't. Â How embarrassing...
2851	Blazfemur	2014-04-11	Look, it's stated in the books, Bran makes Sam promise. Sam in turn, doesn't tell Jon.
Â 
In the series, whether or not Bran asked Sam doesnt matter, Sam still isnt telling Jon. Regardless, Jon knows nothing.
Â 
The ending is still the same, and i could fucking care less whether the exchange happened, as it ended up exactly the same way.
Â 
Put this thread to fucking bed already and read/watch the fucking show.
2852	Blazfemur	2014-04-11	"No, no, this isn't right at all. This show ruins the books because Bran clearly didn't ask Sam to promise. There are notable plot holes in this story because the editors don't know what they're doing, meh, and Bran not asking Sam is one of them. I dont care if it ends up the same way, Bran never asked so THERE."

i wasn't going to bother responding once your argument boiled down to me being stupid because your unsullied brother reached the same conclusion as you therefore that makes everyone else's conclusions wrong.

Pointing out your stupid errors doesn't make me smart either, but it does make you look stupid, especially when you call the writers stupid. At least they haven't made any errors that big in the show yet...
Â 
This entire thread should've been dead the moment someone linked a youtube video of Kit Harrington interview.
Â 
Why did the discussion need to continue after that? I can't prove that Jon already knows anymore than someone can prove that he doesn't know. His actions down the road this season send up huge mega road flare signs that he is going to look for Bran under another pretext. A side quest as it's called in the video game world.Â

2855	Mladen	2014-04-06	SPOILER ALERT: This thread might contain spoilers for all five installments of ASOIAF, so please have that in mind before reading it.
Â 
And here we go again. Welcome to the 5th edition of Discussing Sansa thread dedicated to both book and TV show fans who want to discuss the character, the adaptation and the differences between TV and book version of Sansa Stark.
Â 
I started this thread last year, after episode 3.07 when there was a need to discuss the differences between TV and book Sansa. Since that thread, I have been opening threads in every episode subforum which Sansa appeared in. Up until know, we had three editions dedicated to Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s appearances on the show (episodes 7,8 and 10 of Season III) and there is currently opened thread at General GOT subforum dedicated to the broad discussion about Sansa.
Â 
Since Sansa has always been one of the most controversial and divisive characters, there is always a need to set some ground rules. First and foremost, I will have to ask each and every one of you (myself included:)) to maintain polite and civilized tone during discussion. Furthermore, this thread is not dedicated to everything about Sansa under the sun, but solely to her appearance in this episode, what her scenes mean for her future role and how they diverge from what we know about Sansa in the books. As was previously said, for the broad discussion about Sansa in previous seasons and whatever you want to discuss about Sansa in Game of Thrones TV show, please go to edition IV of this thread and post there.
Â 
I have opened this thread before airing of the episode 1, so you could all post your first impressions right away. I will join the discussion as soon as possible, but until then I invite all of you to post all your impressions, opinions and thoughts about Sansaâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
Â 
With all of that being said, I welcome you again to Discussion Sansa threadâ<U+0080>¦Â 
Â 
P.S. Those who see the episode first, please quote Ran's guideline (if you find it) through which chapters of the book this episode contained, or just write it yourself. Thank you very much.
2856	Jslay427	2014-04-06	Pretty sure we will see Sansa talking about the loss of Cat and Robb this episode. Curious to see her reactions to the loss of family that she didn't cause. ( I had to )
2857	Dany's Silver	2014-04-06	I hope she has her first meeting with Ser Dontos in this episode.Â  I suspect they'll want to get that ball rolling with the impending PW.

2860	Rashtibram	2014-04-06	I'm glad to hear that Sansa apparently isn't friendly with Tyrion anymore post-RW. It'll be interesting to see that play out. Also,

 and LF's lines in trailers are mostly directly from his book interactions with her. So far, her arc looks like it's going to be one of the most faithful to the books in season 4.

Â I think the title of the fifth episode probably relates to his official crowning. I think the title of the second episode relates to a wedding. The title of the 4th episode is the sword that 
	Spoiler Jaime gives Brienne to go look for the Stark girls, and that happens after the PW. I think events unfold rather quickly this season
2864	Dany's Silver	2014-04-06	If they keep to the book, then I'd like to see Left and Right accompanying a certain someone. 
Â 
I supposed it's realistic that his coronation would be some time after the events of episode 2.Â  Given that Peter Dinklage is in basically every single episode, I highly doubt we'll see an episode without the events in King's Landing early on this season.Â  I am quite sad that Sansa hasn't seen what a tremendous ally she has in Tyrion.

2868	BlueDragon	2014-04-06	If we are discussing the show, Sansa has clearly warmed to Tyrion up to the point of the Red Wedding. Â I don't even think she blames him for that in the least.

Is that really that spoilerish since the actual article of clothing is merely a means to an end, and the purpose it serves is already covered by "book spoilers"?Â  I just don't see how it's any more spoilerish than, say, discussing how a character has a different hair color than in the books.
Â 

	Spoiler Anyhow, I don't recall seeing many hairnets on the show, so, it's probably a good change if they're trying to be subtle about it.

I'll tag it anyway, it just seems a little on the innocuous side.

He promises to not harm her, and he certainly has no problem threatening Joffrey on her behalf.Â  That's about as much of an ally as Sansa can hope for in a Lannister.
2873	Rashtibram	2014-04-06	Sorry guys, I edited my posts to add spoiler tags where necessary.

Â 
We also know that episode 8 is when the Viper and The Mountain fight, so the best guess is episode 5, or 6 is the Purple Wedding!




Yeah, it's pretty much been confirmed for months that episode 2 is the PW. It's even called 'The Lion and the Rose.' "Joffrey and Margaery host a breakfast" is what that's referring to. They're not going to say "Joffrey chokes on his wine at the Royal Wedding."

2891	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-06	Sophie is beautiful, and she is a great actress... and getting better all the time. I could feel a huge sense of empowerment when she told Tyrion she goes to the godswood so nobody will talk to her. Sansa is quickly becoming one of my top five favorite characters.
Â 
Can someone give me a link for reliable show descriptions? I'd like to see them.
2892	ohpooratlas	2014-04-06	Well. She kept her lady's courtesy after all.
Â 
But no proactive plan to escape. Boo. 
Â 
But I agree, Sophie gets more and more fantastic every year.
2893	sansatyrell	2014-04-06	Sophie Turner is incredible. She's had a lot of promo for this season (magazines, interviews etc) so I'm hoping that means really great things for Sansa's story. I could listen to Sophie talk about Sansa all dayÂ
2894	ohpooratlas	2014-04-06	I love that Sophie is so supportive of her. I'm always defending her to everyone, and I really think this year will be her chance to shine.
2895	Tooms	2014-04-06	How'd that work our?


Â 
Well, Dontos is only an important character because he convinces Sansa he is a knight in shining armor come to resuce her ... With the events unfolding as they are it is impossible for that story to be told now ... So why tell it? I think if it is Dontos, it will be very minor.
2896	Colonel Green	2014-04-06	I love that Sophie is so supportive of her. I'm always defending her to everyone, and I really think this year will be her chance to shine.


It would be easier for her to shine if the writers weren't deleting all the character's active material.
Â 
I guess she's not buddying around with Tyrion anymore, which is an improvement, but it would be nice if the TV version didn't exist in a state of perpetual catch-up with her book counterpart.
2897	Gannicus	2014-04-06	I never found her to be particularly active compared to most of the other central figures.


It would be easier for her to shine if the writers weren't deleting all the character's active material.
Â 


Â 
Which omissions are most bothering to you?
2898	Colonel Green	2014-04-06	Which omissions are most bothering to you?


The Dontos storyline would be the most obvious one, where they're turning her from an active participant in her escape into an object, who'll sit around wearing a necklace.Â  This was an important plot for the character in the books, and added a lot to her characterization; in the show Dontos is just some dude who'll give her a necklace on the pretext of a gift, drag her out after the wedding, and then get killed as a "shock" (even though the show, in reducing him to such a marginal presence and making Littlefinger such an obvious villain with an interest in Sansa, has removed the things that will make that shocking).
2899	Mladen	2014-04-06	OK, watched the episode...
Â 
This episode, as the previous one, started on unknown territory. Basically, it is too early to tell where it will go, but nonetheless it does have a potential. I have to say I liked the conversation between Sansa and Tyrion in which she audibly expressed her sorrow over her family's death. It was nicely acted, very much in character and overall showed stark (pun intended ) contrast to the beginning of the episode 3/10. The Godswood scene was, alas, problematic. Not because Dontos was introduced too late, but because of the simple fact that they omitted the most important part about the necklace, that Sansa knew that she has to carry it, because Dontos said it will release her. She didn't understand but she complied thus showing the agency the show tragically omitted.
Â 
Well, apparently, the next episode is
Â 

	Spoiler PURPLE WEDDING, and we will see how it resolves

Â 
Â 


Jamie called her Sansa Lannister


Â 
Yeah... I have just come to like him, and he does that... What a Lannister...
2900	Raksha 2014	2014-04-06	Sophie is beautiful, and she is a great actress... and getting better all the time. I could feel a huge sense of empowerment when she told Tyrion she goes to the godswood so nobody will talk to her. Sansa is quickly becoming one of my top five favorite characters.
Â

Â 
Interesting that TV-Sansa, who is the daughter and sister of anti-Lannister supposed traitors, is allowed to traipse around King's Landing without a guard. Â In the books, I think the Godswood was the only place where her guards did not follow.
Â 
But there was some good acting from Sophie Turner tonight. Â
2901	greensleeves	2014-04-07	Great acting from Sophie tonight, as usual.
Â 
I'm also disappointed at Sansa not having more of a clue about the escape plot, but its still way better writing than she got in season 3. Â At least they are just taking away good things and not adding horrible-ness. Â (It might be that my expectations are *really* low after last season).
2902	Sigrunn	2014-04-07	I wonder if the blue necklace is going to replace Sansa's purple amethyst hairnet.
2903	Newstar	2014-04-07	I wonder if the blue necklace is going to replace Sansa's purple amethyst hairnet.

Spoilers for the TV show:
Â 

	Spoiler It will.
2904	The Kinkslayer	2014-04-07	Sansa grieves for Robb, Cat and Ned, but not for Arya, Bran and Rickon that's consistent with the book.
Also, where is Jeyne? I expected her to show up in LF's
2905	Pod The Impaler	2014-04-07	I just can't get used to the idea of Jaime and Brienne being around the same place that she is.
Â 
I guess this is the result of them deciding to bring Jaime back when they did, but this is really going to throw a wrench in the works later.
Â 
Â

Yeah. Hmm. MInor issue, though - it will still do what is required of it.
2906	Widow's B Wailin'	2014-04-07	In regards to the scene w/ Dontos it seems they're trying so hard to keep everything a surprise. The escape plan wasn't mentioned nor was the recommended wearing of the purple amethyst hairnet turned blue necklace (lmao) to the wedding. I guess the writers thought these things would scream 'hey make sure you watch out for... xyz'
2907	ohpooratlas	2014-04-07	I was very much looking forward to her being an active participant in her escape too. I'm trying not to rest too much on my disappointment though because the rest of the episode was so solid and we really won't know how it'll play out until it actually plays out. So who knows? Maybe we'll be pleasantly surprised for once.
2908	SkaggCannibal	2014-04-07	I really likes Sansa in this episode, and it says a lot because I've hated how she has been portrayed for the most part up untill now. I liked how she let Tyrion talk and trying to get to her, after which just left, basically saying "leave me alone". I can easily forgive her talking to Tyrion about the deaths of Robb and Cat, to show how hard it is for Sansa, and also to learn what exactly happened to Cats body. I liked how incredibly friendly and courtious she was to Dontos, even though she should be an emotional trainwreck at the moment. Really courtesy as lady's armour and it gave it a sense of empowerment, as if she knows what she's doing. Hope the show continues on this path.
2909	SkaggCannibal	2014-04-07	And I hated the Sansa Lannister of course.
2910	Lady Arya's Song	2014-04-07	Did not see this mentioned yet here on thread but I noticed that Shae tried to serve Sansa pigeon pie in her scene with Tyrion.Â  Sansa refused the pie.Â 
Â 
It reminded me of a conversation the Old Bear had with Jon way back in Clash I think where he likened poison to lemon pie.Â  George ususally gives us hints if we care to look for them in the books.Â  That conversation between Jon and the Old Bear has stayed in my mind throughout the series.Â  A linkage to lemon and poison and pie.Â  Makes me wonder if Cersei wasn't going for a Sansa Tyrion kill at the wedding. Â  I still believe someone was trying to poison Tyrion during the PWÂ  (lemon creme poured on a pigeon pie) .Â  Nice hint with humor by directors towards speculation about poisons.
Â 
I also liked that the directors started giving her some lines that show her inner strength against the Lannisters...Tyrion included.Â  Finally she is being given some lines to show her inner thoughts.
Â 
The weird thing about the godswood. NO trees.Â  I realize that there isn't a weirwood tree in KL but there are other large trees. So strange to see Sansa praying at a small bush?Â

2912	Lady Beyond the Wall	2014-04-07	Spoiler The necklace/hairnet change up doesn't bother me. The important part was she seemed to be touched by the gift and developes trust in Dantos, which I can see forming.  She needs to have a naive fondness for the item. I love her show character, her look, speech, everything is brilliant. My only criticism is that she always seems dressed too warm for King's Landing.


I am so proud that I finally got the spoiler to work. Not sure how I quoted myself, but oh well.

2913	Elba the Intoner	2014-04-07	Overall I really liked how Sansa was portrayed here.Â  Finally we are seeing the Sansa who wants nothing to do with Tyrion and who is realizing that Tyrion is her enemy. I also liked the interaction with Dontos in that it shows she can still be very compassionate with someone who has done nothing to wrong her or her family.Â  It makes for a good contrast with Tyrion.Â  Also, Dontos brought up his family and how there's no one left and he is in disgrace which is similar to the position Sansa is in.Â  I do hope they show Sansa take more agency in her escape and plotting with Dontos as in the books.Â  I'm still waiting to see how that will all play out before I pass judgment on that.
2914	Woman of War	2014-04-07	I think it was appropriate for Sansa, who is older in the series, to make her sadness, her fury and her despair clear to Tyrion and not to whisper false courtesies like a frightened rabbit. And Tyrion had no answer here, he did not even pretend to have any solace, he offered a sleeping pill, fully aware of how ridiculous that was.
And it was also full of dignity when Sansa, without any veil of courtesy, declared she would not pray anymore but only wanted a place where no one talks to her. 
And that into the face of a character who is mainly characterized by talking as his competence.
Sansa  was not the little bird from the books that melts out of the way but a far more adult young woman who did communicate, who put her foot down and who actively made it clear why she refuses Tyrion's support for the time being.
I like that Sansa far better than book Sansa.
2915	BenBamBoo	2014-04-07	In regards to the scene w/ Dontos it seems they're trying so hard to keep everything a surprise. The escape plan wasn't mentioned nor was the recommended wearing of the purple amethyst hairnet turned blue necklace (lmao) to the wedding. I guess the writers thought these things would scream 'hey make sure you watch out for... xyz'


My guess is that, up until 
	Spoiler the end of the PW, they want to keep the viewers unaware of what is about to happen. In the books Sansa is taken by surprise and Joffrey points to Tyrion as he dies. My guess is that when he dies he will point to Sansa instead and she will have one of the gems/vials missing from her necklace. Chaos will ensue at which point LF will swoop in and spirit Sansa away via a message with Dontos. I don't think his part is finished with yet. I hope the 'whodunnit' saga surrounding Joffrey's death is kept up in the show - it was entertaining trying to work out who really did it.

Would have been a nice moment to say the Hound helped her save Dontos, and expressing a little appreciation for that, Joffrey wasn't buying it until he said Sansa was right.Â And I hated the Sansa Lannister of course.Yeah, don't know how they missed how nasty that is. The viewer's guide has her listed that way, too. Which is so wrong. It's making her a victim twice by calling her that. She's been through enough, don't take her name away from her, too.

2917	timstanton	2014-04-07	in my opinion, sansa has never been a strong character, in the books or show. most of her chapters in the books deal with a lot of inner-monologue, which is hard to translate on TV. i feel like a lot of her latter chapters are there to get a different someone POV chapters. never really cared about her, still dont. just my opinion.
2918	Mladen	2014-04-07	Yep, pardon my language, but that was quite the "Fuck you!" to Tyrion, and he knew it. "She despises me." Bingo!

Â 
I watched these scenes again, and I like this new approach. There is no more "we could try, this might work" approach. Plain and simple, it hasn't been working and it won't work. I kinda like far more that scene than on the first viewing. Mostly because in the books Tyrion knows he can't offer her anything, but in the show, it worked because we had that moment in episode 3.10 where the underlining message of their conversation was "OK, this could work". So, after last season, this comes as fresh air to show us that the marriage in question is indeed travesty and that Tyrion simply can't be both her loving husband and a Lannister. We finally saw disconnect that, truth be told, in the books existed from the beginning, but here was created by such impact made by RW. The more I think about the dynamics between two of them in this episode, the more I like it.
Â 
Plus, I am sorry, but entire thing about how difficult is to translate some things to TV, is simply BS. And this episode proves it. From the beginning that symbolically represented the end of Stark reign (I adored how music changed from sad tone of "Winterfell" to sinister tune of "Rains"). Last night we have seen how it works with Ellaria too, where in very short time you got a lot (I am afraid even too much). So, there is a way to translate almost everything, especially internal monologues, you just have to have right approach.
Â 
One thing I liked is Sansa knowing how her family ended at RW. In the books, she didn't want to know when Tyrion asked her, and I remember thinking back then that there is at least mutual understanding between two of them and the desire of escaping bad dreams. Here, with much older Sansa, it made sense for her to know (although I kinda hoped last season that we would have seen Joffrey being cruel to her and telling her). So, I feel like there has to be completely new approach to TV Sansa in terms of some things, given that age here does play significant role. IDK, perhaps this is future book Sansa retrograded in position of ASOS Sansa, if that makes any sense 
Â 
As for Dontos, again, I am bothered with her not knowing she will escape at some point, but alas, the narrative demands dramatic turn and I do understand that. We all know what we are going to see next Sunday (or Monday if you are in Europe ), so after watching it and thinking about it, somehow it perhaps makes sense from producers' POV. They introduced the key element, without emphasizing its importance using one of Sansa's best characteristics - her compassion for others. And it did break my heart, when I realize how wonderful parallel is there between Ice and that necklace and that Sansa, disgraced daughter of traitor whose house is now ended, is giving one moment of "glory" to the house that met the similar end.Â
2919	Sasha Steelsong	2014-04-07	Do you think Dontos won't be murdered by LF when Sansa leaves KL and goes with them instead to The Eyrie and becomes the one LF uses to cover up Lysa's murder?

2921	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-07	YES. I *loved* the quietly resolute ''it's the only place where no one talks to me'' there was no venom, no false courtesies, just a glimpse of a young woman, in her own words, making damn clear how she feels. Fantastic, already much better than season three sansa characterization which I was *not* fond of, though through no fault of Sophie Turner, hopeful for Sansa this season and excited for the next episode

Â 
Dontos was creepy with Sansa in the books. Â I am actually surprised they have toned down the creep factor with both Dontos and Tyrion (and Joffrey). Â Sansa suffered a lot more in the books.
2926	Dragon of Valyria	2014-04-07	Huh -- had I known that there were dedicated Sansa discussions going on here, I'd have kept discussing the show last season! I stopped about partway through.
Â 
At any rate, I am glad Sansa's getting an increasing role in the show as time goes on. She was barely in entire segments of season 2, but thankfully her substantial appearance in Blackwater made up for it. We saw her a lot in season 3, and we got some substantial scenes in the opening episode of this season as well.
Â 
Her conversation with Tyrion is excellent. I dislike most changes from the books, but I think in the absence of an internal monologue, continuing to have her armor herself in courtesy would make her feel dense, superficial, or stupid: criticisms I often hear from show-only viewers who tend to be hostile towards Sansa. Here we get to see the depth of her love for her family, and how truly helpless and miserable she feels in captivity. Her hunger strike makes it clear that she feels that she has nothing to live for -- almost similar to what Arya feels at the beginning of her scene, until she has a chance to be motivated by revenge. That's not in Sansa's nature, thankfully.
Â 
The Dontos scene is interesting because she doesn't remember him at first. To her, it was a simple, natural act of kindness that anybody would do. To Dontos, it was a life-changing event -- and it's telling how unusual and strange an act of kindness is in King's Landing. It singularly sets Sansa apart from the rest of them. As the member of her family who always stuck out as most suited for a southron court, it now turns out that she -- among all the southron lords and ladies -- sticks out as a truly noble Stark.

Yeah, well, if Dontos begun to speak about how the hairnet was justice for her father and everything, a particular event would look rather obvious.
2930	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-09	I think this episode was a nice start for the show to begin displaying Sansa's depth more completely. I'm definitely one of those book Sansa fans who gets frustrated when she is out-of-hand dismissed as stupid or dumb by those who don't read the books and only know her based on the show. I think Sansa is such an interesting character with the potential to really become a Catelyn 2.0 (and I'm a huge Catelyn fan so I'd love to see that). I'm glad she was able to dismiss Tyrion and we got to see her expressing her sorrow over her family. Â I think the Dontos scene was good and though different from the books, I understand why it's not all being laid out. Â This was a really good start and gives me some hope that we will get to see more and better for Sansa.
Â 
Also, Sophie Turner is just getting better and better. Â They really hit the jackpot when they found Sophie and Maisie.

2931	Sand11751	2014-04-09	Sansa as a whole gets too easily dismissed, in the way the character was written and in comparison to feisty, sword-wielding Arya, with each sister embodying their Tully vs. Stark heritages. Sansa doesn't have a sword, so she arms herself with dignity, but still gives a few glimpses of that Stark defiance. Part of the problem with the view of her on TV come from the way in which Tyrion has been sanitized by the show. Anytime he tries to comfort her and she rejects him, she looks like a bitch - I've had fellow watchers say to me, "He's trying! Why can't she meet him halfway?" I don't know; maybe because his family kicked things off by killing hers and as of the RW were still killing Starks. If TV Tyrion were the Tyrion of the books, I suspect more might see Sansa's POV. Â  Â
2932	acosta	2014-04-09	I went back and rewatched season one with my somewhat-deaf fiance and since Amazon Video closed-captioning names the characters speaking, I noticed Marillion is the singer with Cat and Tyrion in the Vale, but he's also the singer who has his tongue removed by Ilyn Payne, so he definitely didn't stay in the Vale and he isn't a singer any more, so I do wonder how they'll deal with that.Â
2933	Colonel Green	2014-04-09	That role is 100% replaceable.Â  It's not a problem.
2934	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-09	. I'm definitely one of those book Sansa fans who gets frustrated when she is out-of-hand dismissed as stupid or dumb by those who don't read the books and only know her based on the show.


Â 
The way I respond to those people is this:
Â 
I explain that the author'sÂ modus operandi is to take the common ideas and tropes about fantasy stories and smash them to pieces.
Â 
Sansa starts as the fair maiden who loves the stories about noble knights and heroic tales etc etc.... she is US.
Â 
She then moves on to being the 'Princess trapped in the tower by the wicked Queen' - except there are no beautiful knights in shining armour coming to save her.
Â 
She isn't weak, she is a ~13 year old girl who is powerless. Her and Arya are two sides of the same coin - they are both Starks... and remember Tyrion's line "My Lady, I believe you will outlast us all" - she is not one that should be dismissed.
Â

Â 
Everyone I have told that to has immediately started to actually pay attention to her story. Two people even went and bought the books the next day.

Sounds like a better sales pitch than my "some people are in a quest for justice, vengeance or power. She's in a quest to grow a brain"
2936	TheSpottedCat	2014-04-09	Â 
I was wondering if that particular event would happen so early given the title of the fifth episode. I am surprised that they would change the hairnet to a necklace.Â  I wanted to see that chain of events play out according to the book.


I'm guessing it will play out in more or less the same manner. A certain someone might come up to Sansa, touch her necklace and say "my, what a pretty necklace!" or something like that. As for the change of the item, I don't think it's such a big deal. They probably did it because a hairnet does not fit in with the show's chosen style for King's Landing.
2937	TheSpottedCat	2014-04-09	I wonder if the blue necklace is going to replace Sansa's purple amethyst hairnet.


I think the necklace is a soft lavender/purple colour, not blue.
2938	Grail King	2014-04-10	I thought they gave a hint of Sansa's intuition ability with the Dontos scene just after Jamie and Brieenne leaves Â about 46:20 in a little zingy music as Dontos walks by.
2939	Cyberia	2014-04-10	Did anyone notice what Sansa did for Dontos?
Â 
She finally stepped up and became a good guy.Â  Not because her name is Stark, but because that's what good guys DO, they look out for those who can't.Â  THAT'S her way out of this nightmare.Â  She'll never beat the Lannister's at their game, but she can beat them at her game.Â  Most assuredly terrible things have happened to her and her family, but the good guys don't stop doing what they do.Â  They mourn and move forward.Â  Sansa just found her center amid all the darkness and chaos.
Â 
There's a difference between being born a noble, and being noble.Â  Sansa truly was noble there.Â  And for the first time in a long while...she smiled.

Â 
I am sorry, but this isn't exactly true. Sansa has stepped up and been a good guy for quite some time, both in the books and TV show. First, she saved Dontos' life because he didn't deserve to die, after KL riot, she told that she would have given them bread, if she had. She told Cersei that she wants to be loved, she takes charge of the women during Blackwater battle, told Margaery out of compassion that Joffrey is a monster, and in Vale showed great deal of kindness towards everyone... I agree with your conclusion that Sansa might win playing her own game, but she has always been noble,
Â 
As for smile, well, she did smiled at episode 3.10, so it's not been long ago...

I hate the constant slapdown, in your face crap done to the Starks by the Lannisters and we have not even seen Roose Bolton yet. That statue though was so visually sickening and infuriating it is good the actor that plays Joff is accross the pond. No, but seriously. The shows producers and directors are remarkable for this "added" image. They are really setting the table (heh, heh) for things to come. Well done

I actually took the statue to be the fight against the direwolf Nymeria in season one. The line you quoted is exactly what Cersei says after she explains the story is going to be what he said happened. Not what actually did happen.
2960	sati	2014-04-08	That transition from statue to Joff was the funniest moment of the episode, just brilliant.
2961	BlackTalon	2014-04-08	There shouldn't have been moss on it. There could barely have been enough time to make the statue after the RW, much less for moss to grow on it.
2962	Buckwheat	2014-04-08	It was hilarious. Exactly something that Joffrey would order to be made.
Â 


The best part of the statue was seeing Joffrey doing the exact same pose in the very next scene.


Yep, this.
Â 


I would love a Tommen proudly holding Ser Pounce statue.


Oh, PLEASE D&D, make this happen!
Â

True, the statue looked too old, like Lyanna's statue in the crypts of Winterfell.
2963	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-08	Loved it. they're not letting us forget how much of a little turd joffrey is.

Â 
Oh, gosh I forgot about that! The only encounter he's actually had with a Direwolf is when he got bitten and cried like a little girl....but yeah, of course he can hunt them. Â  
Â 
Here's a picture of the Statue and then his pose right after-

I don't think it looked that old.
2965	iheartseverus	2014-04-08	I feel as though they added the statue to make it seem like Joffrey is here to stay.Â 


Actually, the Unsullied over at PTV have been positing that the statue means just the opposite.Â  They note that we haven't seen any statues of people throughout the series, except for statues of dead people--Baelor, and the statues of dead Starks in the crypt at Winterfell.

My apologies. It was my intention to make the point by point connection. The incident with Joffrey and Nymeria . Leading to the advice from Cersei that I quoted to the statue and Joffrey's "truth". Which then transitioned to the scene with Joffrey standing similar to the statue and then making the claim that he won the war. Again Joffrey's "truth". 
For me it all tied together nicely and it  gave me the feeling that Joffrey is taking the victory as his own. Since the Starks are the ones that made made him feel vulnerable and weak. They actually saw him for what he is. 
It's personal for him. It's funny that he is so insecure about it that he goes so far as to have that statue made.
2967	TheEvilKing	2014-04-08	It was the best part of the episode. Gonna miss the little critter.
2968	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-04-08	The statute was the only point when we paused the show and rewound on the first viewing b/c it was such a WTF moment.
Â 
Joffrey, Joffrey, Joffrey...
Â 
I don't think there has ever been an easier villain to hate.

2969	Marco	2014-04-08	I laughed aloud. The whole think is hilarious: "I broke Stannis, I won the war!".
2970	Ser PeaCH	2014-04-08	Great stuff!Â  Him standing over a defeated wolf (call-out to his brush with Nymeria and Cercei's words "the truth will be what you say it is") is perfect.
Â 
I didn't catch that it was a wolf the first time around; I assumed they posed him over a boar such as the one that killed his "father".Â  But wolf of course is much better.
2971	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-08	It was good since it was exactly the sort of thing Joffrey would demand to be made. Plus, like another poster said, when it's torn down eventually it would represent the demise of the Lannister reign.
2972	Khal Shaggydog	2014-04-08	I definitely didn't see the wolf on the first viewing, wow. Â Too bad he didn't actually have to face a direwolf again in real life, that would've really been something to watch - "Stop - I am the King! Â You cannot eat me! Â NO, you cannot bite my throa....."
Â 
Same goes for Tywin. Â Dude really should have been faced down with poor little Arya, while Nymeria and a couple dozen on her minions materialize from the woods behind her. Â Nymeria then pounces and pins Tywin down, while she kills him with a slow, smooth neck stab.
Â 
Too bad they both got the old "poison and death from a direct relative" treatment.
2973	Vespa	2014-04-08	It was the best part of the episode. Gonna miss the little critter.


Â 
Same here. Love to hate this wee shit.
I didn't notice a wolf though, somehow it looked more like a bear to me Â Still, nearly fell off the sofa laughing.
2974	Jojosh	2014-04-08	I thought it was too entirely in character for joffrey but I did like his scene with JaimeÂ
2975	Seneti	2014-04-08	I loved that statue! Had to keep myself from laughing out loud and waking up my roommates. And I can't wait for next weekÂ
2976	Angmar	2014-04-08	Betcha as the season rolls peasants will destroy that statue, while Cersei goes crazy for it.
2977	TheSpottedCat	2014-04-09	I actually paused and rewatched the scene several times. It was so funny.. Especially when they transitioned to him doing the exact same pompous-ass pose in real life. I also loved the little details on the statue: the king's favourite crossbow, his absurdly small asshole-y crown, him stepping down on the wolf. Obviously he thought they made him look grand and fearsome.
2978	Lord Damian	2014-04-09	Joff will go down in cable/tv lore as one of the most hated villains in history.
2979	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-09	I hope it becomes a running gag in GoT. Then, a Tommen statue, then Mace, Aegon, Dany, and every single person whose ass sits on the throne.
2980	GHOSTSTARK	2014-04-10	i thought it fit perfect with who Joffrey is and how he rules. hides behind others in danger but when theres no one around hes so mighty ha
2981	Lady Fevre Dream	2014-04-10	That was one fugly statue.Â  Did they even try to make it a decent one, or as I suspect, it was just meant to induce anger in us, LOLÂ
2982	roxWolfox	2014-04-10	I would love a Tommen proudly holding Ser Pounce statue.


I love this idea!Â Â  
Â 
After I wiped a couple of tears from my eyes, my first thought was, "Sheesh, that's a pretty small direwolf.Â  For shame, Joff...I thought it would be the size of a horse!"
Â 
Then I just hated on him for the rest of his scenes (the poor actor).
2983	Hodor H'ghar	2014-04-10	I laughed my ass off when i saw it. Check thisÂ out.Â

Â 
LOL I know right? I laughed so hard when I saw that stupid, arrogant Joffrey posing.Â  I can't wait to see him get what's coming to him!
2985	Illusive_Man	2014-04-11	I liked it a lot.Â  It was very much in character for Joffrey to commission a statue that soon after the Red Wedding.Â  His vanity is second only to his mother.Â  He truly believes that he was the one who killed Robb Stark.Â  Just look at his exchange with Tywin regarding Robert's Rebellion.Â  He thinks he is his "father's" son, the warrior who saved the Seven Kingdoms.

I love your analysis.Â
2987	Queen of Whores	2014-04-11	I'd love if when Tyrion escapes in the finale he walks past it and takes a piss on it. I think I'd literally burst into laughter. Just a final 'F you' to Joffrey.

Â 
Hmmm, maybe Sansa gets to knock it down while she's fleeing?Â  Then, Tyrion can come upon the crumbled remains and piss on it?Â

Â 
Yes, this needs to happen! 
Â 
I think they have more in store for the statue other than just being a display of Joffrey being a douche. Perhaps, it won't be until next season or the last season- when we've all but forgotten Joffrey- but something has to happen to that statue, surely? My fingers are crossed..
2990	Rhaquentis	2014-04-11	That was a great scene, my Unsullied friends started laughing when they saw it.Â and of course, they called him names.
2991	pwnt	2014-04-11	What's up with all the Joffrey hate?Â  I think he is badass.Â  Kings need to be ruthless and back then, when they had no TV and other stuff to distract people, they had to have severe public punishments.Â  I only hope that one of the episodes this season ends with a shot of Margeary all shot up with crossbow bolts (like that redhead chick last season).Â  I think both she and her sick aunt are weak and have no place near the iron throne.Â  Also, Joff should kill his mother because she is totally out to control him.
2992	iheartseverus	2014-04-11	^^ New troll in town, folks.Â  Has trolled at least 3 threads in the past 20 minutes.Â  Yawn...
Â 
Remember, never feed the trolls, it just makes them feel important.
2993	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-06	It seems that Shae's increasing jealousy regarding Sansa will come in handy as a reason for her to betray Tyrion if he was ever on trial for.......anything really bad..... What do you think?
2994	Lord Godric	2014-04-06	I think that because of the way they portrayed Shae and Tyrion's relationship it wouldn't be that believable had she simply turned on him later and then slept with his father. Â I knew from last season once we saw her jealousy that that would be why she wanted to help Cersei in Tyrion's trial. Â And I imagine that, since we now know that Cersei knows of their relationship, we may even see a Shae/Cersei scene prior to her testifying at the trial.Â
2995	Cas Stark	2014-04-06	It's a start.
2996	shiola	2014-04-06	Anyone who thinks Shae will not betray Tyrion didn't see the scene where the two of them & Bronn were playing a game in Tyrion's tent shortly after they met. Â They also did not see season 3 episode 7, where Tyrion tries to give her a necklace.
Â 
It's been set up from the get go.
2997	SeventySeven	2014-04-06	Yeah, well they need to build up on it and it was about time tbh. I was also happy to finally see Cersei getting some shit done and having people spying for her. Last season she did nothing and was such a flop.
2998	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-06	Anyone who thinks Shae will not betray Tyrion didn't see the scene where the two of them & Bronn were playing a game in Tyrion's tent shortly after they met. Â They also did not see season 3 episode 7, where Tyrion tries to give her a necklace.
Â

Â Remind us, wise one, what did she say during the tent scene that gave herself away??
2999	shiola	2014-04-06	Well, first of all, he says that he is an excellent judge of character before the drinking game. Â He proceeds to get every single statement about Shae wrong. Â This shows that he can't read her very well, even though he could read Bronn.
Â 
Then, after Tyrion tells the Tysha story and is clearly upset by it, Shae's immediate response is "You should have known she was a whore." Â Tyrion says he was young and stupid. Â Shae says, "You areÂ still young and stupid." Â AKA, blatant foreshadowing that he will forget Shae is a whore.
3000	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-06	I think that because of the way they portrayed Shae and Tyrion's relationship it wouldn't be that believable had she simply turned on him later and then slept with his father.

Â And I imagine that, since we now know that Cersei knows of their relationship, we may even see a Shae/Cersei scene prior to her testifying at the trial.Â 


Â 
I'm betting we'll get a scene pre-trial of them together as well.
Â 
I agree that the circumstances of Tywin's death are just unbelievable... there are many theories floating around about that, but I won't get into it. I will say that it seems like the show is setting this up for a revenge type of situation when it comes to both the trial and the Tywin ordeal. Will that be canon? We still don't know why Shae was there. I can't wait to find out how they're going to portray it without confusing those who haven't read the books.
Â 
Interesting that Shae told Tyrion about Varys coming to her, and Tyrion was (of course) clueless. I'm not sure what to make of that except it bodes ominous.

Â  I'm not sure I'd call that blatant foreshadowing. And in between there she explains that he should have known she was a whore because she wouldn't be interested in sex minutes after an attempting raping. But still, yes, I have no doubt she will betray him.

Â 
I've seen the series so many times now that when I see any bit of foreshadowing, it sticks out to me like a huge red flag. Â "Blatant" is probably not a good word, you're right. Â

Â I'll have to rewatch that scene, but I think she accused Tyrion of sending the diamonds to make her go away himself. She said something like "you tried to send me away". I don't think she mentioned Varys. After reading the scene with her in Tywin's bed, I always kind of assumed that it was probably part of the deal to let her live: she must sleep with Tywin.

Â Right, when we know what happens, almost anything can appear as foreshadowing. But, like I said, i'd be very surprised if she doesn't betray Tyrion.
3005	Cas Stark	2014-04-06	Yes, they are FINALLY, at long last, beginning to set the stage for Shae to betray him. Â Did I say finally? Â
3006	shiola	2014-04-06	Â Right, when we know what happens, almost anything can appear as foreshadowing. But, like I said, i'd be very surprised if she doesn't betray Tyrion.


Â 
Same. Â Surprised, and super disappointed.
Â 
Shae was evenÂ more obvious about the fact that she was simply Tyrion's whore in the books, and itÂ still caught me off guard at the trial and later in Tywin's bed. Â I don't think any reasonable amount of foreshadowing would prepare non-readers for her betrayal. Â It's just when readers say "Nah, TV!Shae won't betray Tyrion", I'm like "...What, now?"

Â Last season her jealousy was almost playful. This episode it was serious, and had a bite to it. I can almost hear the directors now "remember, you are REALLY jealous this season....no more fooling around...we need to really show the viewers how hurt you are....."
3008	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-04-06	Â I'll have to rewatch that scene, but I think she accused Tyrion of sending the diamonds to make her go away himself.

Â 
She did accuse Tyrion of doing it, but Tyrion knows that it wasn't him, so it had to be someone else trying to rid him of Shae. But she did not mention Varys, you're right.
Â 
It's a good theory, but I thought Cersei was the one responsible for getting Shae to cooperate. Cersei, I'd say, knows nothing of her father's promiscuousness.... would she really stipulate a clause like that? Is the Shae situation important enough for Tywin to handle himself? I was always under the impression it was Cersei controlling those strings.
3009	Natasi	2014-04-06	I really enjoyed Tyrion's concern for Sansa, even if it was just a vehicle show Shae's jealousy.
3010	Bayard	2014-04-06	To me it seemed forced. So they are so in love last season and now this??? And why does he refuse her? why doesn't he visit her? Why doesn't he answer when she asks him if he wants her there??? Of course she would star to balk. Why is she staying as a maid for Sansa??? Does he even give her money anymore? Why would she be faithful to him now??Â  She still acts so bad
3011	MercyTheBlindUglyLittleCat	2014-04-06	I felt it was pretty clear from certain things last year, that they were going to build to it in this manner. It did feel a bit forced this episode, but they don't have time, given the PW is the next episode.
3012	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-06	Â Remind us, wise one, what did she say during the tent scene that gave herself away??


Â 
She said that Tyrion should have known his little wife was a whore
3013	Mr Hodor	2014-04-06	Their relationship is getting irritating now.
3014	Rymun Royce	2014-04-06	Their relationship is getting irritating now.


Â 
Shae was irritating from the start.Â 
Â 
I guess its a good point to have Shae all jelous of Tyrion to set up the betrayal, but I constantly wish Tyrion could just snap and put her in her spot, she is a whore, thats all she is, and here she is giving a member, the lowliest member true, of the richest family in the realm, and at that point the most powerful, a bad time because of an arranged marriage to the conquered family's daughter. Get your head out of your ass Shae.Â
3015	Scrambled Aegon	2014-04-06	Tyrion doesn't think of that as being all she is, though. Tyrion is in love with her and doesn't seem to really see the jealousy, and certainly doesn't see her as only a whore. (Because Tyrion... has issues.)
3016	Justin Danford	2014-04-06	I'm rolling my eyes at this set up. It's the one thing I didnt like about the episode.
Â 
I think the TV show made the Shae character too strong, and too likeable. With the impending plotline, that needs to change, and it looks like the way its going to change is through a cliche misunderstanding where if either of the characters only spoke a bit more, there wouldn't be so much of an issue. That sort of plot device it contrived and only holds weight during on-screen time. Obviously time passes off-screen, but this sort of plot device would have you believe these characters ever only meet in the scenes we see, and thus fall further and further down a hole of unfortunately unlucky exchanges.
Â 
> Shae looks back and sees Tyrion touch Sansa's hand in compassion. Mistakes it for love.
> Tyrion too stressed to rustle the sheets with his girlfriend. Shae suspeccts a loss of interest.
> Shae thinks it was Tyrions idea to send her away. Tyrion acts bewildered, doesn't get a chance to deny it.
Â 
If that trend continues I'll be dreading every Shae/Tyrion scene except the last.

3017	Kyrion	2014-04-06	This changes the entire dynamic that Tyrion doesnt want Shae.
Â 
The reason for killer her was passion, he knew she was lying but he wanted to believe her, even lied to himself. Yet he saw her plainly as selfish, so he took out his anger on her. She betrayed him.
Â 
Now the dynamic is that Tyrion wants to just stay away from Shae, and doesnt seem to want her around, so her betraying him now is bad, now when he kills her, it will literally be just the evil dwarf killig someone that crossed him, not as a crime of passion. Â I dont like this development, since it changes Tyrion slightly, he was actually MORE sympathetic in the books, now its just that he is a monster.
Â 
It was bad enough why he kills Shae in the books, but in the show, oh boy lol

Â 
I don't think he doesn't want her. I think the idea is suppsed to be he is too caught up in all the crazy things happening in KL, and is too obssessed with keeping her safe to really pay her too much affection at the moment. This comes off to Shae as if he isn't interested, which we all know isn't true.
Â 
That is sort of my problem with the depiction. It's just a big misunderstanding, which is always the most annoying of plot devices. The books display a much more dyanmic relationship between the two, and the reveal and eventual murder are a result of a heart-crushing undermining of Tyrions world by Shae (which spins him into his downward spiral for ADWD).
Â 
As it is now, we just have 1 stressed out hopeless romantic, and 1 confused hopeless romantic...if only they could talk it out it would all be okay, but no, they just never get the chance and oh, look, now he murdered her :[

Calm down here now... Just because He was stressed out and didn't want a roll in the hay at that precise moment doesn't mean that Tyrion doesn't "want" Shae.Â

Tyrion just had to wait around for the Dorne party to arrive, he knows he is being sent because even though the Lannisters have to welcome them Tywin is using him as a fault against them, so Tyrion knows that he wont be greeted nicely because he is a Lannister and because he is the Imp, he is already at odds because of the shutdown Tywin gave him last season, he is now married to someone who has the absolutle right to hate the Lannisters, he knows the realm is going to sht, and furthermore as master of coin, which we know but hasnt been shown, he knows the realm is terribly indebted, his brother, whom he loves is missing a hand, and a buncho of other sht, I think he can be forgiven to not being in the right state of mind to have sex with a whore who constantly gives him sht over his arranged marriage.
3022	Envie	2014-04-07	Like many others, I previously had criticism for the show's producers decision in painting Shae and Tyrion as 'truly' in love and often wondered if they didn't do that to make unsullied viewers be more caught off guard or just to make them dislike Shae more for her jealousy I don't know...but now it's starting to make more sense they'd want the 'love' element to be central to the betrayal. Keeping it much more subtle as in the books would have been harder to pull off and just like they cast Robb's wife as a much more central figure so it would have more dramatic impact at the red wedding scene, they're casting Shae as a much more central player and with more passionate motivations too. It's all for the drama of the show because there's really very little 'true love' in the books. Series fans want romance....so they had to create some (Robb and Talisa, Tyrion and Shae) wherever they could I guess.
3023	Inv1ctus	2014-04-07	Like I said some time last year, they would have to force the breakup somehow, because they made the relationship in the tv series so much more than it is in the books. I really hope they won't set it up as a big surprise to the viewers, because imo it will feel very forced imo. First they made her smart and funny and she was protective of Sansa just like Tyrion, and now it will all turn into sudden jealousy and hate, even though she knows that Tyrion doesn't even want to bed Sansa. They should just leave her character as it was in the book, a simpleminded whore. I don't even care if she ends up with the chain around her neck or not, whatever.Â

Even though that is true what you said, it's still such a HUGE stretch for me, that Shae will do this 180 in the series because she thinks Tyrion has feelings for Sansa. And she's suddenly willing to basically kill him, it just doesn't sound believable to me. The only way they can pull it off is if they introduce her family into the fold, and Cersei now knowing who the real whore is, will threaten her family so she basically decides to rather betray Tyrion. All else I'm not buying it. IMO.
3025	Newstar	2014-04-07	Shae's jealousy of Sansa mystifies me, since even in 3x10 she seemed to understand that if Tyrion felt anything about Sansa it was similar to her own feelings: pseudo-parental protectiveness, as opposed to sexual desire. Their little shared smile when Sansa made the shift/shit mistake seemed to reflect that. She really seemed to grasp that Sansa posed no threat to her relationship whatsoever and in fact that the marriage could coexist nicely with her relationship with Tyrion. She doesn't want to fuck Sansa, after all, even though she cares for her in a platonic, parental way, so why would she imagine that Tyrion would? And now it's all accusations of Tyrion being in love with Sansa, even though Shae is smart enough to know that the idea is ridiculous.
Â 
What is plausible to me is that Shae believes that Tyrion has lost interest in her with no reference to or jealousy of Sansa and is paranoid that he'll set her aside for other reasons--he's bored with her, he's lost interest in having sex with her, he's sick of sneaking around, etc.--and that she's bitter because she's confident in this eventual rejection and because she knows he'll never choose her over his family. THAT would make some sense to me: that she's invested so much in this relationship and not only is he unwilling to do the same, but he's losing interest in the relationship and her and there's nothing she can do to stop it.
Â 
Then, when push comes to shove, it will be not so much "I'm going to help kill this man for betraying me!" but something more like "He would have abandoned me eventually and wasn't willing to sacrifice anything for me, even though I loved him so desperately, so why should I lift a finger to help him when helping him could mean my head? Better to save myself."

3026	Charles Phipps	2014-04-07	I think Tyrion isn't very sexually active right now because of self-esteem issues. At the risk of Godwinning, he's aware that he's no longer in a family of ruthless bastards who are kind of cool, but evil criminals. Joffery wants to kill him and rape his "wife" and his sister wants the same. Tywin also has made it clear he's scum and hates him. In short, he's having a really bad couple of months.
Â 
Shae is assuming he's just become tired of her and is probably imagining Sansa will eventually fall for him because she's got issues with men (and justifiably so).

3027	Jaime4Brienne	2014-04-07	Their relationship is getting irritating now.


GETTING irratating!!! You must have the patience of a saint!! I have always detested Tv Shae and this morning (at 2am, that's when they showed it here) She was making me so annoyed I wanted to fast forward. I can't wait until what happens happens. She deserves everything she gets and more.
3028	Charles Phipps	2014-04-07	I've always had the idea that TV Shae was never sincere in her love for Tyrion. She just knew that his emotional neediness was the best way to manipulate him.
3029	Envie	2014-04-07	Almost forgot: An unsullied friend of mine said they think Shae set that whole scene up on purpose to try and catch Tyrion and get him in bed. She was already pissed when Tyrion dismissed her and saw him holding Sansa's hand so she's already sold out to the other maid who is a spy for the Queen. Did anyone else thinks this might be the angle they're going for or was it obvious enough that Shae was just trying to get Tyrion's attention without ulterior motives and the other maid was spying on her too legit?
3030	Woman of War	2014-04-07	Shae's jealousy of Sansa mystifies me, since even in 3x10 she seemed to understand that if Tyrion felt anything about Sansa it was similar to her own feelings: pseudo-parental protectiveness, as opposed to sexual desire.

And now it's all accusations of Tyrion being in love with Sansa, even though Shae is smart enough to know that the idea is ridiculous.I agree with you here but there might still be another aspect:
With what Shae interprets as Tyrion being less interested in her he has as well shown to her that he sees Sansa as "one of his kind", as someone who counts no matter what his feelings towards that girl may be. Sansa is the noblewoman whose fate gets attention by the nobleman. To Shae it looks like "they all stick together and I am shit to them." And there may lie the ground for a different kind of jealousy towards Sansa that comes a little closer to book Shae's emotions: "that spoiled girl gets everything for free what I have to work hard for"
Â 
What is plausible to me is that Shae believes that Tyrion has lost interest in her with no reference to or jealousy of Sansa and is paranoid that he'll set her aside for other reasons--he's bored with her, he's lost interest in having sex with her, he's sick of sneaking around, etc.--and that she's bitter because she's confident in this eventual rejection and because she knows he'll never choose her over his family.

Better to save myself."In the end HBO Tyrion may even look worse than book Tyrion since book Tyrion was honestly outraged while HBO could have read the signs of a misunderstanding - depends on how they'll play Shae in Tywin's bed
Edit: I think the other maid spied without (edited, the doorbell was distracting me) Shae knowing, my impression only.

Shae's betrayal is one of the central subplots which sends Tyrion down the spiral into what he becomes later in the books after murdering her and then his Father. They cannot possibly downplay or remove it and still have the same impact on Tyrion's character progression. It defines much of his transformation (or degeneration).
Â 
Killing off the handmaiden in Shae's place doesn't seem like the same great shocking drama as was written so why would they change it? For a "Love Story" continuation? Unless D&D know something we don't about Tyrion after he goes to Pentos... I don't see how...

The show will say that Tywin's betrayal is enough to set Tyrion on that destructive path.

Again, we have so little back story on Tysha that I doubt the show write her subplot into the story.

3040	Charles Phipps	2014-04-07	Seriously, once Shae condemns Tyrion to die by lying about him do you think ANY viewer will care when he kills her?
3041	.Nymeria	2014-04-07	Major noob here, and I'm only on my second reading of the series, so I may be getting some of the details wrong, but I guess I always assumed Cersei/Tywin figured Shae out during questioning after the PW. Is that wrong?
Â 
It's bugged me from the start that the show paints Shae in such a noble light. I think it's so central to Tyrion's character that his desire to be loved and accepted is strong enough to trick his otherwise pretty spot-on interpretations of people. But it further bugs me that her betrayal will now also start with this other handmaiden. It's not going to be Shae who willingly tells all for more pretty dresses or jewels or whatever they likely promised her -- she's going to be somewhat forced into the betrayal after she's caught.
Â 
And I still don't know that they'll be able to angle this jealousy bit to the entent they need to for her time in court. Either they'll soften her testimony or the depth to which she betrays him during that testimony will make no sense.
Â 
I guess I just like Tyrion enough to appreciate what the book Shae storyline revealed about his character, and the show Shae storyline seems to take all of those insights away.
3042	Newstar	2014-04-07	If Tyrion is already passive-aggressively isolating himself and implying he would be okay with Shae getting gone, and if Shae's already this angry with Tyrion, Shae turning on him will come as a surprise to no one. I guess Tyrion and Shae could have a brief reconciliation before the PW to restore the status quo, but as it is, I don't see how Tyrion would have much of a leg to stand on in the shock department.
3043	The Monkey	2014-04-07	I'm so thrilled that this was (hopefully) the last Shae/Tyrion scene. They're fucking awful, and have been from the start. No chemistry whatsoever between the two actors.
3044	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-07	The jealously is obviously being built up as the reason for the betrayal, but she's just really irritating now. While you can see her motivations, she just seems to be a character who's there to moan and makes things even more complicated for Tyrion. It worked earlier in the show when they tried to build on the character and they sort of succeeded, but she's generally regressed into someone who's just there to moan at Tyrion now.

3045	Pilusmagnus	2014-04-07	Book Shae was uninteresting as a character. Show Shae is actually a pretty big megalomaniac possessive jealous bitch, which will increase our satisfaction when she finally dies.
3046	JesterX	2014-04-07	The series has clearly made so much more of Tyrion/Shae's relationship than the books did.Â  In the books, Shae never said or did anything to make Tyrion or any reader think she was in love with him.Â  The series went all out on that.Â  It seems the jealousy angle is the only logical way to justify what will likely be Shae's turning on Tyrion in the series.
3047	Oakenfist	2014-04-07	Â 
This would make sense since I don't remember hearing about Tysha once.


Â 
Tysha has been mentioned plenty of times in the show.
3048	timstanton	2014-04-07	my main gripe with shae, in the books and the show is her complete lack of understanding about politics. this is a girl who was a whore in tywins camp, one of the most ruthless men in all the seven kingdoms. even the lowliest of whores working for little finger know to keep their mouths shut. tyrion has been honest with her about his lack of freedom and duties as a lannister from the very beginning. yet even know, in kings landing, shae has almost been killed by stannis and his men, heard about the red wedding, but she has no fear of tywin or what might happen. when she says things like, lets run away, its infuriating. dont you get it fool! i could see her being manipulated by cersei or tywin in the show, but i really hope they play it up more and she just shows her true colors as a heartless bitch. i will very pretty mad if tyrion doesn't kill her, but mainly for tyrions character. i love him, but he is not a "good guy" like the show makes him. in my opinion.Â
3049	timstanton	2014-04-07	correct me if im wrong though, but doesnt tyrion try to deny shae multiple times but eventually ends up giving in on almost every occasion? i think the show might be alluding to tyrion feeling his duties as a married man as well, he mentioned it in the brothel scene with oberynÂ
3050	Animist	2014-04-07	I agree that the circumstances of Tywin's death are just unbelievable... there are many theories floating around about that, but I won't get into it. I will say that it seems like the show is setting this up for a revenge type of situation when it comes to both the trial and the Tywin ordeal. Will that be canon? We still don't know why Shae was there. I can't wait to find out how they're going to portray it without confusing those who haven't read the books.


Â 
What's not believable about revenge-sex? And Tywin is a man.. he needs sex as much as any man.. he just knows not to get attached to a whore (or anyone probably) like Tyrion does. And he doesn't make a fool out of himself about sex around others. Nothing is unbelievable about Tywin doing Shae. He probably even thinks that Tyrion will find out eventually and it will be another lesson about whores to teach Tyrion - just like his older message. So Tywin gets some prostate maintenance done at the same time as teaching his son a lesson.. the man is efficient.

Â 
I agree. And I think for those reasons they're going to have Tyrion kill Shae. Plus they had Tyrion give her a golden-chain necklace last season, which I can only assume was to replace the Hand's chain (which the show made a pin).
3052	lyanna_maria	2014-04-07	Â 
This would make sense since I don't remember hearing about Tysha once.


Â 
Well, we had a whole scene about it when Tyrion tells the story, and we can see it was very important and traumatising for him.
Then we have Cersei's comment when she makes Ros her captive: "At least, you haven't married this one". Once again, we can see in Tyrion's eyes how much that still hurts him.
Then when he's told by his father that he is to marry Sansa, he delivers the line "I was married once" with that amazing intensity: no way to overlook that.
And in the next episode, I think, we have Bronn make some kind of joke about Tysha, and Tyrion says "I never should have told you that", thus telling the audience that he regrets telling the story to Bronn because it's so private for him and it hurts him so much.Â 
Â 
Those are the mentions I can remember, I don't know if I'm forgetting some. Ithink we've heard enough of Tysha as not to think that they will overlook that plot.Â 
Â 
I was feeling quite pessimistic about this, thinking they would turn Shae into Tysha, but after yesterday I definitely think they will stick to the books. The only thing I don't like is Tyrion pushing Shae away: why would he do that?
3053	Sand11751	2014-04-07	D&D said in an interview that they deliberately changed Shae after seeing the actress' portrayal. I like this nuanced TV Shae rather than book Shae 'I'm a whore and that's what whores do'. That Shae just saw the way the wind was blowing and went with it. This Shae is shaping up to be more a "hell hath no fury..." kinda chick, which might help TV audiences relate to her more. She's helped along by a sanitized, whitewashed Tyrion who would never sleep with someone else while the poor wife continues to reject him. Â
3054	Sasha Steelsong	2014-04-07	It seems that Shae's increasing jealousy regarding Sansa will come in handy as a reason for her to betray Tyrion if he was ever on trial for.......anything really bad.... . What do you think?


Â 
I'm on the fence though I think it is likely. Â The complication is that I genuinely believe that Shea loves and wants to protect Sansa (which of course was totally absent from the books) and genuinely feels something for Tyrion as well, which makes it all more complicated. Â I could easily see her feelings for Sansa staying the same but starting to resent Tyrion (since he's not sleeping with her even if he isn't sleeping with Sansa), which could definitely lead to some interesting and conflicted emotions after the next episode. I think it will come down to her being given a choice and Tyrion reading the wrong things into it.Â

I thought that back in Season 2, but I don't see why they're introducing the jealousy plot-line now if that's how it's going to end up. If they did that as a motive for Tyrion killing Tywin, then Shae wouldn't even have to testify against him.
3058	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-04-07	Yes, and correct me if I'm wrong, but in the book it didn't seem like there was anything that stuck out to as why she did betray him, as it wasn't really stated.Â  It also seems that the jealously is a lot more so in the show then it is in the book.Â  I mean it did seem like if she didn't betray him that she would be cooked, so I guess it was assumed that a deal was struck between her and Cersei?Â  Anyways, its clear in the show that her mood and patience will be what blows her spot up.
3059	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-04-07	Yes, and correct me if I'm wrong, but in the book it didn't seem like there was anything that stuck out to as why she did betray him, as it wasn't really stated.


Â 
It's not completely shown because it's Tyrion POV but he expected her to react bad at his wedding with Sansa and she's more like "whatever, We'll still fuck, right?". He doesn't realise she's there for the job, wife or not.
3060	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-04-07	Â I wouldn't say that.Â  I think they do well together, I just think it isÂ hasÂ draggedÂ on.Â  We know that she is mad and doesn't like what is happening, so how much more can you really add to this subplot?Â The problem is theÂ show has made her so much more than what she really is and they shouldn't have.Â  They should have just kept it the way it was in the book, now its just so much more involved in the show.Â  I understand why they did it, so that they could show how they both have truly fell for each other, but I don't believe it should be in this manner.Â  Its not as though she should be shocked about what is going on, considering what she is and what he is and I believe she accepted in the book.Â I think fromm what I said in an earlier post, correct me if I'm wrong, I don't believe it was really shown in the book on why she betrayed him, so I feel they are trying to build it up to how she could by having her act in the manner that she is which will eventually turn into betrayal.


I'm so thrilled that this was (hopefully) the last Shae/Tyrion scene. They're fucking awful, and have been from the start. No chemistry whatsoever between the two actors.

3062	Floop	2014-04-07	At this point I think it's entirely possible that other Lannisters will kill Shae instead of Tyrion, which in turn could work for the show because it gives Tyrion further motivation to kill Tywin.
Â 
They made a decision on the show, which I fully support, to make Shae much smarter, more caring, and more loyal than the one dimensional whore she is in the novels. If Tyrion murders her, betrayal or not (and the way they have constructed her on the show it can only be a betrayal brought on solely by threats by other Lannisters, in my mind), then Tyrion loses a great deal of likability. I find it hard to believe that Tyrion could kill the Shae that exists in that world, and I find it hard to believe that they makers of the show would be willing to show such a beloved character (Tyrion) in such a bad light.
Â 
The show is obviously not afraid to make changes, and I sort of expect the handling of the Shae situation to be altered given the choices they have made with her so far.
Â 
On the other hand, they could decide to have Tyrion kill her out of rage only to find out later she was completely under duress. This could add an additional tragic element and really fuel his fire for revenge. I think it's going to be hard to buy his almost instantaneous leap from true love to murder if they decide to go that route, however.

3064	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-04-07	Â Oh of course.Â  Tyrion is one of the favorites of the show and for the most part he hasn't done any wrong. SO to have Shae who he has protected and has given her a life that she otherwise would not have to have her betray him in the manner that she will is going to make everyone turn on her very quickly

Â 
I hate to do those annoying repeat posts, but to me it's much probable that Tywin kills Shae.
Â 
Why? He got proof she bedded Tyrion after Cersei threatened/bribed her (will surely happen, don't we agree?).
Â 
When? While Tyrion is imprisoned. And if I'm right, IÂ soÂ hope it's shown on screen.
Â 
And I don't expect Tyrion to say the "shit gold" quote in Tywin's last scene. I hope it's only said to JonCon later.

Â 
He won't because HBO knows shock is all that keeps millions watching this series. Ned, The Red Wedding, and so on are the reason people tune in.
Â 
Because stuff happens which doesn't in other series.
Â 
Stuff like one protagonist killing his girlfriend.

3067	Cas Stark	2014-04-07	Seeing the beginning of "bitch" Shae last night makes me now lean toward Tyrion killing her. Â I still would have preferred a different "take" by the show, talk about hackneyed upon hackneyed so we have the hooker with the heart of gold whose going to turn into a woman scorned bat shit crazy driven by revenge bitch from hell. Â I would have much preferred an ambiguous Shae where the audience is guessing if she is for real or if she is trolling Tyrion the entire time, instead of what we got.
Â 
But, if they have Tyrion kill her, that is still better than any other alternative.
3068	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-07	GETTING irratating!!! You must have the patience of a saint!! I have always detested Tv Shae and this morning (at 2am, that's when they showed it here) She was making me so annoyed I wanted to fast forward. I can't wait until what happens happens. She deserves everything she gets and more.


No, she doesn't.Â 
Â 
Â 
My main problem is how forced this arc is going to seem. One moment TRUE LOVE, next, MURDER? Really? Play up more on Shae's worries about being thrown aside because that works, but I hope they don't go down the jealousy path, because that doesn't.

Â 
That's what we saw though last night. Â No mention of financial security or anything else. Â Only she wants to be with him...and HE refuses to fuck her, LOL. Â 
Â 
For the record I also didn't like that it was Cersei who was refusing to fuck Jamie instead of vice versa, since that was a big deal for him and in his ability to move forward.
3070	Charles Phipps	2014-04-07	I've never been convinced Shae's feelings for Tyrion are genuine in the show. As Littlefinger explained to Ros the important thing about being a hooker isn't having a good body or willingness to have sex but the ability to put clients in the mood by giving them what they want. The seduction scene with Natalie Dormer shows that in order to wield any kind of authority/position in Westeros, you need to know what the client wants and how to manipulate them. In Shae's case, she knows Tyrion Lannister wants less of a hooker and more of a girlfriend/confidant and it's a train she can ride a very long way.
Â 
But ONLY if she convinces him she feels for him. If she plays hard to get and convinces him to continue to want her.

Â 
She tries to get him to leave for Essos with her, and she turns down a giant bag of diamonds to leave the city. Â She has also, legitimately attempted on several times to help Sansa. Book Shae never attempts to help anyone, ever, at all.
Â 
This leads me to believe that she is supposed to be seen as serious about him and much nicer than her book counterpart. Â 
Â 
If not, then shame on D&D for not hiring a better actress who could have put in a more subtle performance that would leave a few question marks.
3072	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-04-07	Â I think they will have no choice but to show him in a bad light at some point.Â  Even when he goes and does the deed in the book I don't feel any differently about him.Â  His family could give a rats ass about him, he has done more good than half of the back stabbing monsters on the show and all the noble things he does for his family he is kicked to the curb and is almost assassinated.Â  I don't think anyone would have an issue if he killed his father with or without a good reason.Â  TywinÂ in the books and on the show has basically stated he wished he was dead and admitted to almost killing him.Â  How can anyone feel badÂ for what will happen to Tywin?


At this point I think it's entirely possible that other Lannisters will kill Shae instead of Tyrion, which in turn could work for the show because it gives Tyrion further motivation to kill Tywin.
Â 
They made a decision on the show, which I fully support, to make Shae much smarter, more caring, and more loyal than the one dimensional whore she is in the novels. If Tyrion murders her, betrayal or not (and the way they have constructed her on the show it can only be a betrayal brought on solely by threats by other Lannisters, in my mind), then Tyrion loses a great deal of likability. I find it hard to believe that Tyrion could kill the Shae that exists in that world, and I find it hard to believe that they makers of the show would be willing to show such a beloved character (Tyrion) in such a bad light.
Â 
The show is obviously not afraid to make changes, and I sort of expect the handling of the Shae situation to be altered given the choices they have made with her so far.

I think him not confirming that he wants her to stay was the more hurtful thing to Shae, really.Â
3074	Charles Phipps	2014-04-07	I also read the idea that she realizes she passed up a genuine chance to make a lot of money with Varys.
3075	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-04-07	Â I think she truly loves him, and I think with the maidens spying on her and Tyrion will leave her no choice to do what she is going to.I wouldn't be surprised if Varys has involvement with getting ridÂ of her as he tried to once already in the last season. Tyrion is not aware that he did, so this will be interesting how this plays out.Â  I stillÂ don't think theyÂ needed to make her more than what she was from the books

Â 
One thing I appreciate about this series is that sex workers are treated as human beings no different from anyone else. There's no need for a "Hooker with a heart of gold" anymore than there needs to be the discredited idea they're somehow all either broken or manipulative psychos. In Westeros, everyone does what they have to do to survive. Getting Tyrion to leave with her and the diamonds can both be viewed from legitimate self-interest points.
Â 
As for Sansa, no, that's just Shae being nice but there's reason for her NOT to be nice to her.

3077	Newstar	2014-04-07	D&D said in an interview that they deliberately changed Shae after seeing the actress' portrayal. I like this nuanced TV Shae rather than book Shae 'I'm a whore and that's what whores do'. That Shae just saw the way the wind was blowing and went with it. This Shae is shaping up to be more a "hell hath no fury..." kinda chick, which might help TV audiences relate to her more. She's helped along by a sanitized, whitewashed Tyrion who would never sleep with someone else while the poor wife continues to reject him. Â 


Â 
I like the idea of a nuanced TV Shae as well, but in execution her characterization has been all over the map.
3078	Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl	2014-04-08	Â 
Shae was irritating from the start.Â 
Â 
I guess its a good point to have Shae all jelous of Tyrion to set up the betrayal, but I constantly wish Tyrion could just snap and put her in her spot, she is a whore, thats all she is, and here she is giving a member, the lowliest member true, of the richest family in the realm, and at that point the most powerful, a bad time because of an arranged marriage to the conquered family's daughter. Get your head out of your ass Shae.Â 


I agree. Â I cannot wait for her to leave my screen forever!!! Â
3079	King Zee	2014-04-08	Ha! On a another site someone mentioned that during the trial , we could have Tywin looking rather intensely at Shae --implying he's about to make good on this threat to Tyrion but in reality....he's getting horny baby.
3080	Theda Baratheon	2014-04-08	I just have no idea how it's gonna play out but i'm bored already
3081	Rhaquentis	2014-04-08	The only thing that bothers me with Shae is the way she talks to Tyrion and Sansa in the show, as if she's on the same level as them. Â (It's kinda bad writing.)

Â 
So true. She's a whore, an exclusive one, but still a whore. And a servant. Tyrion and Shae live in a feudal society where arranged marriages are the norm yet she acts like Tyrion's betrayed her with another woman and got married to spite her. She was pretty snippy to Sansa at the beginning of her servitude, "What shall you have me do?" "YOU'RE the servant. You should know what to do."
Â 
Do we ever find about anything more of Shae's backstory? I don't recall ever reading or seeing anything about it. Maybe she was highborn or merchant class wherever she's from.
3084	Cas Stark	2014-04-08	Â 
It's the acting. She's really one of the weakest links in the cast


Â 
She's okay as the one note character that she puts on the screen, but she's not giving any kind of "nuanced" performance.
Â 
If she is supposed to be creating a multi-layered Shae, who is conflicted in her feelings about Tyrion and Sansa, who is supposed to be creating some kind of subtext that leaves the audience guessing that she does or doesn't feel the emotions she expresses, then she has completely failed. Â There is no subtext there. Â None.
3085	Fool of a Book	2014-04-08	Since we don't know book-Shae's motivations for betraying Tyrion and sleeping with Tywin, I think D&D's characterization of Shae has been a huge stretch. Â They are almost entirely different characters.
Â 
If we find out later that, for example, Shae was working for Tywin all along, or being blackmailed/threatened, how is this silly jealousy arc going to serve the story? Â Because we'll certainly learn more about why book-Shae did what she did.
Â 
My worst fear is that the fate of book-Shae won't happen, and tv-Shae will turn into Tyrion's Tysha.
3086	Chebyshov	2014-04-08	My worst fear is that the fate of book-Shae won't happen, and tv-Shae will turn into Tyrion's Tysha.


Â 
I'm worried they might have Shae killed by Tywin, but the jealousy plot makes me think they'll stick closer to her actual fate. We've had Tysha mentioned numerous times in the series, so I doubt Shae will be a stand-in.
3087	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-08	Â

This is my exact thoughts about the two other invented characters: Ros and Talisa. All they have for guidance is the script as written and the directors that get helicoptered in are in the same boat. Â All the other characters have the benefit of the source material to draw from (or at least direction and writing that is based on an interpretation of the source). I count Shae as invented because TV!Shae is so far removed from Book!Shae they may as well have changed her name anyway.
Â 
That issue was, to me, painfully obvious with a lot of Ros's scenes and I just can't bring myself to blame Kekilli, Chaplin or Bianco for the results.

Â 
I thought the girl who played Ros was a decent actress, it's too bad they didn't give her a better part.
Â 
I have nothing good to say about Chaplin. Â Nothing. Â She sucked. Â She sucked as an actress. Â It is possible, just barely possible, that a better actress could have brought off "Talisa" as believable in the context of the show. Â So, I do blame Chaplin, she wasn't the whole problem, but her modern mannerisms, modern speech pattern, generally flat acting, bad acting...all contributed to the horror.
Â 
Sibil is okay as Shae, as long as Shae is the happy hooker with a heart of gold, if she is supposed to be showing the audience something more nuanced, then she, too, sucks at it.
3089	yushkevitch	2014-04-08	To be honest they could've bypassed the whole chamber scene if not for the spy ... Her look as she walked away from Tyrion and Sansa in the garden is about as obvious foreshadowing as you can get on-screen.
3090	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-08	Chaplin's mannerisms and speech patterns should have been knocked into shape by the direction and writing.... and that's the crux of the problem I feel. They were evidently happy with the results.
Â 
I find it interesting that even though you admit that it is 'just barely possible' another actress 'could have' made it work (two big 'ifs') that you still lambast her personally.

Why not? Â Good actors can elevate the material, bad actors can take good material and make it bad or mediocre material and make it worse. Â Chaplin was bad in the role, her acting was wooden and modern and bad. A better actress as I said "might" have helped matters. Â 
Emelia too is very limited as an actress but they rarely ask her to do anything but look and act regal, so she manages to exist within the role they've given her. Â The same with Sibil, assuming that she is supposed to be the good hearted one dimensional person we see on the screen. Â Kit has been okay, bad and better, compared with Charles Dance who is amazing in every scene he has been in as was Michele Fairley.

And there is a whole spectrum of people who fit in between the 'Good' and 'Bad' poles. A better actress 'might have helped matters', I agree, and a better actress might not as well. When the director has said 'Cut! Great job' there isn't much more that can be done.
Â 
Since the comprison with Dance has been made, I will say that after his amazing performance in the scene last season with Tyrion and Cersei where he established Tywin's dominance over his family, this episode's scene with Jaime was a real let down. I don't blame Dance for that though. I blame the writing and direction. Even a demonstrably great actor can't always make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Decrying a normal human as being 'bad' because they are also unable to do the same seems somewhat unjust.

Â 
We can agree to disagree here.
Â 
Sibil as Shae, for example, is "okay" she's not a great actress, she gets the job done, I will have no complaints unless it turns out that her declarations of love for Tyrion have been false the entire time, then I will say she was not up to this task as an actress because she failed to inject any subtext or ambiguity into her performance. Â I think she gets too much flack in general, she is believable to me in the role. Â But, the character they've written is still to me kind of hackneyed.
Â 
I thought Chaplin was terrible, all around, as an actress, in the role, even accounting for the lame writing and characterization she was given, she made a bad role worse.

I totally agree with this. What an actor does on camera, to what an editor and director choose to be in the final version, can be MILES apart.Â 
Â 
I personally, happen to love Esme, Oona, and Sibel, and I love what D&D have done with the writing of their characters. All three have been vast improvements into 3D humans than from their barely there characterizations in the books, which in turn gives everyone they're around better dramatic choices to make, and a better overall script.
Â 
Now, as to WTF is going to happen to this entirely different Shae - I'm as confused as everyone else.
Â 
I don't see how they can stray away from the main plot lines of who kills whom. I think the GoTNerdVerseâ<U+0084>c would completely meltdown if Tyrion doesn't kill Shae. I don't see how they can change that. I really don't, even though it seems they have that option. But it would take away a HUGE character layer for Tyrion. Tyrion is their EMMY WINNER. Peter can handle whatever they give him.Â 
Â 
What we know:
Cersei is seen saying in a preview, the same line about "...turn to ashes in your mouth, and you will know the debt is paid" that Tyrion Â said to her in season 2. This looks like it's the trial.
Tyrion gave Shae the murder weapon (necklace) last season.
Cersei's spy has now caught them.
Â 
How it could go down:
Shae disappears, and isn't around to help Sansa get ready for the wedding. (Or she disappears during the wedding - we don't know if she's just mad at Tyrion, or Cersei has "detained" her, but Tyrion can't find her.)
Cersei teases Tyrion about his "whore" at the (Blue-Violet) Wedding, threatening him. (Giving Cersei even more reason to suspect him of murdering Joffrey.)Â 
Joff dies (while there are MANY people who want him dead: Tywin, Tyrion, Varys, even Jamie, and countless foreign spies.... )
Cersei accuses Tyrion.
Tyrion is arrested.
The next time we see Shae is at the trial where she testifies against him with Cersei's lies, audience and Tyrion are shocked.
Jamie mentions something negatively about "Tywin's whore" to Tyrion as he helps Tyrion escape.
The audience is just as shocked as Tyrion when he finds out Tywin's whore is Shae - so it will make perfect sense when he kills her.
What we have yet to hear Tywin say is, "Wherever whores go" before Tyrion then kills him and leaves for Pentos.
3096	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-08	It's more desperation than jealousy. Her prediction is coming true. "I'm a whore, and when you grow tired of fucking me, I'll be nothing."
3097	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-04-08	Â

Â 
, I will have no complaints unless it turns out that her declarations of love for Tyrion have been false the entire time, then I will say she was not up to this task as an actress because she failed to inject any subtext or ambiguity into her performance.
Â 
Â 


Â I don't feel this this is 100% fair. Most of the actors likely haven't read the novels, and my guess is that Sibel hasn't. Its just as likely [perhaps even more likely] that the directors never planned ahead far enough to inform Sibel that there was an undertone of betrayal beneath her affection for Tyrion. Other actors such as Peter Dinklage have admitted that they did not know how the plot was going to go from season to season, and that they were surprised when they read the script each season. So I feel it would be more likely a shortcoming of the showrunners for not injecting those subtleties into Sibel's acting.
Â  Having said that, Sibel is not my favorite actor on this show.

Tyrion just had to wait around for the Dorne party to arrive, he knows he is being sent because even though the Lannisters have to welcome them Tywin is using him as a fault against them, so Tyrion knows that he wont be greeted nicely because he is a Lannister and because he is the Imp, he is already at odds because of the shutdown Tywin gave him last season, he is now married to someone who has the absolutle right to hate the Lannisters, he knows the realm is going to sht, and furthermore as master of coin, which we know but hasnt been shown, he knows the realm is terribly indebted, his brother, whom he loves is missing a hand, and a buncho of other sht, I think he can be forgiven to not being in the right state of mind to have sex with a whore who constantly gives him sht over his arranged marriage.


Well, since you put it that way, I have to agree!
3099	TheKitttenGuard	2014-04-09	Does anyone think they will reverse the order of the killings?
We never see the secret entrance to the Hand's chamber on the show and it may not be in or so close to the bedroom.
3100	ovis alba	2014-04-09	With Shae I can really not tell if it's the character or just the actress that is annoying me.
Maybe it's a little bit of both. I definetly cannot stand the accent to start with, which sort of makes everything she says a little more annoying then it might otherwise be.

For me its definitely the character. I thought Sibel carried it is S1 and it became problem when Shea 'fell in love with Tyrion' instead of treating like a trick.

Â I think its a little of both, but I feel that this is actually a credit to the actor, as part of her job is to make Shae annoying.
3104	Red Tiger	2014-04-10	I thought Chaplin was terrible, all around, as an actress, in the role, even accounting for the lame writing and characterization she was given, she made a bad role worse.

Â 
You know besides having a nice ass, I really don't see what Robb saw in her. The romance was a lot less believable than the Tyrion/Shae one IMO.
Â 
Terrible terrible idea on the producers' side.

Â 
Â 
But reality is that Shae does not care. She is a whore and is attempting to manipulate Tyrion in the same manner she has been all along. Difference is that she is not smart enough to realize that she is in real danger. She sees how Tyrion reacts to Sansa and overreacts not because of true jealousy but because she is still trying to manipulate Tyrian. Fact is Shae is/was an opertunist, she jumbed at being in the bed of a rich Lannister, and when his fortunes turned bad she does not hesitate to betray him and get in the bed of an even more powerful Lannister. A whore is a whore, nothing more need be said of her desires or intentions.

Â

That's not much of a debate.Â  Nothing we've seen of Shae suggests she's manipulative.Â  If anything, she's blunt to the point of seeming socially inept.
3109	MoA«t	2014-04-10	Well, that question is what is being debated.
Â 
IF the actress is trying to portray a manipulative shallow Shae or a multi-dimensional one.


How about she's playing the Shae she's being directed to play by the script, directors, and final editors on the show, all of whom have a say in what finally makes it to air.
Â 
If you want to criticize an actor's performance, they have more control over what the audience sees if you go to live theatre. Yes, the buck stops at the director, but you can only give an actor so many notes, and the rest is up to them in a live performance.
Â 
Film/TV by comparison, has a lot more hands that can shape an actor's performance, than just the actor, via editing, ADR, and all manner of ways to shape a performance.
Â 
I really have never seen more people be so hateful of so many actors in a show than "fans" of this one on these boards especially, most of whom seem to hate it so much, I don't understand how some even bother to watch it.
Â 
I can understand how certain people can rub others the wrong way. I can understand not liking a casting choice when you imagined the character different in your head. I get that. But attacking the actors by calling them bad, when they're not (yes, all you Emilia haters, the Emmy nominating committee would like a word with you...) just seems very petty.
Â 
Sibel, Emilia, and EsmA© are all very talented actors, and have all been more than capable with the material they've been given.
3110	TheRatCook	2014-04-10	I'm not overly qualified to judge acting. However, I'm of the opinion that perhaps the directors felt that a love relationship between Tyrion and Shae would be more appealing to the audience. But who knows really. It will be fun to see what happens.

She dares to behave to the Master of Coin in a way how a present day girlfriend would and not a lower class prostitute, it is hardly believable that she would show her anger the way she does.
And yet it makes them both more relatable imo. After all the show is presented to a modern audience and to most of us (fortunately) those class differences are history. 
It started as island of happiness, and we wanted Tyrion to be happy, the only sexy love story in the books, and then it went down the drain. Actually so far the whole Tyrion/Shae relationship has been presented as an island of present day realism, the lover who has to come up against the rivals of job and wife, the so very sad and conventional dilemma of the extramarital fling  who has to wait until her lover can wriggle out of  the important things in his life and find some spare time recreation with his little affair. The saddest position a present day woman in our "western" world can be in.
In the books Tyrion clearly does not want Shae  as partner to confide in, always jumping in his thoughts between prostitute and lover. And in the series the different Shae has no other answer to his worries than offering sex to detract him. She is unwilling to listen to whatever he says and he has given up on sharing his worries with her.
They both are unable to communicate, as much as Tyrion and even Shae seem to be in love. It is an affair having gone sour for lack of honest communication or for having passed its expiration date and they both did not see it coming. Tyrion may still have the illusion that he can deal with it and Shae may have realized the end in all its brutality. The lover dumped. Normally we would call her the lover who has sacrificed her best years .......yaddayadda..... But in that case of course she was far better off than she would have been working on the road.

3112	Cas Stark	2014-04-11	Â I don't feel this this is 100% fair. Most of the actors likely haven't read the novels, and my guess is that Sibel hasn't. Its just as likely [perhaps even more likely] that the directors never planned ahead far enough to inform Sibel that there was an undertone of betrayal beneath her affection for Tyrion. Other actors such as Peter Dinklage have admitted that they did not know how the plot was going to go from season to season, and that they were surprised when they read the script each season. So I feel it would be more likely a shortcoming of the showrunners for not injecting those subtleties into Sibel's acting.
Â  Having said that, Sibel is not my favorite actor on this show. 
Â 


Â 
Â 
I'm not sure that is believable, D&D know what happens to Shae, if they wanted her character to turn out to have been snowing Tyrion the entire time, they would have told her, thats not an oversight thats the basic characteriziation as far as I am concerned.

Â Well, I'm not sure we know what D&D would or wouldn't do, that far in advance, butÂ I think its totally believable the showrunners wouldn't think that far in advance for a subtle acting device, especially since they had no guarantee the show would even last this long, back then. Particularly consideringÂ other actors have admitted they didn't read the novels, and didn't know what to expect from season to season. Its actually less believable they would have injected that kind of subtlety so early on.
3114	JesterX	2014-04-07	In the books it was a complete mystery that Littlefinger wanted to take Sansa from King's Landing, so it was a surprise when we found outÂ Dontos was acting as Littlefinger's agent.Â  But on the series we know full well about Littlefinger's interest in Sansa.Â  The whole Dontos storyline seems completely irrelevant now.Â  So why bring him in?
3115	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-07	IIRC doesn't LF give Sansa a chance out of Kings Landing but she refuses? so i geuss to the audience it defiantly looks like that ship has sailed, both literally and figuratively.

Â 
Exactly. LF, by all accounts, has left KL. Sansa had her chance to leave, but she refused.Â 
Â 
Dontos is still the go-between for LF, but Unsullied don't know that *yet*.
3117	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-04-07	Dunno, but since everything was fast-forwarded and jumbled up, I hope they have a good plan.
3118	RoamingRonin	2014-04-07	So that LF isn't directly involved in anything. Sansa needs the neckless/hairnet and for someone to escort her to the ship.Â
3119	HannibalStark	2014-04-07	Why bring Dontos in now??? it seems for the same reason they bothered to have him (and maybe Lothar Brune) in the show in the first place....he is still serving the same purpose in the show now that he served in the books, isn't he?Â  He meets her in the Godswood and gives her the necklace/hairnet that we we can assume will be used very soon at a wedding?
Â 
But whats more is that Sansa and everyone else is suppose to assume Lf is gone, so there has to be someone with a reason to be in KL to talk to Sansa and get her onto the feather bed waiting on the boat for her.
Â 
I am not sure I understand the mystery...Dontos is in the show for the same reason he was in the books it would seem...he hasn't been in the show again till now because they didn't need to waste screen time on him till now.
3120	DominusNovus	2014-04-07	Personally, I found his introduction annoying for a very specific reason: As I was explaining to my fiancee just how many named characters will die this season, I said something like "and the book is even worse. Â They kill off people that the show decided just weren't worth keeping in. Â Like that drunk from the joust in season 2. Â He dies in like episode 2/3. Â But he hasn't been seen since then, so they're not going to bring him back just to kill him off..."
Â 
Dontos appears on screen. Me: "Oh, sonofa..."
3121	shiola	2014-04-07	They brought him back: so LF wouldn't be directly involved, because Dontos has a motive to be nice to Sansa, and to keep it a little bit closer to the books than if they had not brought him back.
3122	Sarah Lannister	2014-04-07	Someone has to help San-San find the boat, and make sure she doesn't get lost.Â  King's Landing is a difficult city to navigate, especially after a regicide.Â
3123	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-07	She had her lowest-of-low points at the end of S3.
Â 
Bringing him back now is a turn-around from that point to show that she does actually have one person who might be her friend.
Â 
In light of an escape plot, we shall just have to see how it plays out.
3124	Montey14	2014-04-08	Sansa denies to go with Littlefiger beacuse she thought she was going to may Loras.....besides Ser Dontos' real job is to carry forth the magic necklace....
3125	protar	2014-04-08	I've speculated before that bringing Dontos back so hurriedly is probably the result of a last second change of plan. The result of two change of plans actually. Imo Plan A was to do things as in the books and have Dontos helping Sansa plot her escape, hence his introduction in S2. But for whatever reason (maybe Tony Way's acting not being up to standard) this was scrapped. Plan B was to have Ros be LFs accomplice in spiriting Sansa away. But then they decided to kill Ros off early, to fully reinforce just how brutal Joffrey is and/or to help retain an ounce of surprise as to who's behind Sansa's escape. This explains why Ros' death gets absolutely no mention in later episodes - her death scene was inserted late into production and she was actually supposed to be still alive at the end of the season (probably to be killed later by LF like Dontos was).Â 
Â 
Now this is just my personal speculation, but it makes a lot of sense to me and explains the messiness of how it's all being handled.
3126	Greywolf2375	2014-04-08	Why bring Dontos in now??? it seems for the same reason they bothered to have him (and maybe Lothar Brune) in the show in the first place....he is still serving the same purpose in the show now that he served in the books, isn't he?Â  He meets her in the Godswood and gives her the necklace/hairnet that we we can assume will be used very soon at a wedding?

The question seems more to be why haven't they brought him in beforeÂ for any interactions.Â  Yes,Â it appears he's serving the same purpose, butÂ even though he has been in the background for some scenesÂ this basically is an introduction for him.Â Â For some of the things they have spent screen time on I'd have rather had him have some time so that he is relevant rather than a "hey remember we did this thing and you've since forgotten about it?Â  we're bringing it back".
3127	Chebyshov	2014-04-08	They brought him back: so LF wouldn't be directly involved, because Dontos has a motive to be nice to Sansa, and to keep it a little bit closer to the books than if they had not brought him back.


Â 
This, plus I think he'd be a good replacement for Marillion. If I had to guess, I'd say Dontos is making it to the Eyrie
3128	Natalie Underfoot	2014-04-08	Ehh I feel like Ser Dontos in the book was as much of a plot device as he is here & Sansa needs the necklace and it needs to come from someone she can reasonably trust. He really does work the best. She helped him and hes giving her a necklace and he probably won't appear again until the end of the wedding when she's scared and confused. Better him than a major character that would tip the hand of all the machinations afoot and lord knows the show has enough characters to add a new one.

Â 
Of course he's a plot device in the books too. When it comes down to it a story is all just plot devices, it's a good writers job to use smoke and mirrors to disguise that. Martin does this a lot better than D+D have by introducing Dontos early, seeding him as a sympathetic character throughout and only after both of those things introducing the escape plot.
3130	HannibalStark	2014-04-08	Â 
This, plus I think he'd be a good replacement for Marillion. If I had to guess, I'd say Dontos is making it to the Eyrie


Â 
thats a good point, kudos for the idea.Â  It bothered me that Marilllion was killed in the first season, but some random singer (character) for tv audiences carrying over from season 1 to season 4/5 might not have made sense either.Â  I figured there would be some random singer that was in Lysa's court, but using Dontos for his actual purpose and to tie that loose end off sounds good to me.
Â 
But I do like the betrayal of Dontos and the lesson he teaches Sansa right off the get go....
Â 
but there is the idea that LF brings someone to the Vale that is blamed for killing Lysa, it kinda means he can be argued to be seen as responsible for it....where as Marillion has already been rubbing the people there the wrong way and there already is a bit of rancor between the singer and everyone else??Â  But still, using Dontos for Marillion in the Vale, I think could work.
3131	HannibalStark	2014-04-08	The question seems more to be why haven't they brought him in beforeÂ for any interactions.Â  Yes,Â it appears he's serving the same purpose, butÂ even though he has been in the background for some scenesÂ this basically is an introduction for him.Â Â For some of the things they have spent screen time on I'd have rather had him have some time so that he is relevant rather than a "hey remember we did this thing and you've since forgotten about it?Â  we're bringing it back".


maybe they did have scenes with him but they ended up getting cut?
Â 
I remember seeing both Brune and Dontos and thinking sweet, these parts are making it to the show....I wondered if Dontos would appear in the Godswood since Sansa spent much of last season there, but they used scenes with Margie interacting with Sansa there instead...maybe they figured having so many people approach her in or near the Godswood would be bad?Â 
Â 
I just think they didn't need to waste valuable screen time with Dontos and Sansa, especially when they could show Margie and show a relationship with Margie and Sansa when trying to convince her marry Loras.
Â 
I am bothered more about Sansa marrying Loras instead of his gimpy brother than I was Dontos' screen time being cut.
Â 
Someone else mentioned Dontos could make it to the Eeryie and replace Marillion, so where they cut his screen time last season and gave it to Margie, they could now be using him for multiple things this season.
Â 
I agree that there are some things that they add content with the TV that make no sense to me...stuff is in the show and its not in the books and for the life of me I can't understand it.Â  I think it would be stranger to have not used Dontos at this point after the scene he was in last season...vs not using him at all.

Â That he is attempting to save her is perceived by her as a valiant act that speaks to her naive notions of chivalry. Littlefinger has a fair grasp of Sansa and Dontos' minds and knows the perfect tool (Dontos) that would speak to her desperation as well as her sympathies: Dontos needs to be there. Â It's a compelling story and the outcome adds an even lower level to Littlefinger's depths.

Exactly. Baelish is gone. Somebody needs to get her out of KL and unless they want Sansa to come across like a complete broad, it better be someone who she has met before and who she has even the slightest reason to believe/trust. Plus, somebody had to give her the hairnet/necklace.

3137	Natalie Underfoot	2014-04-08	I feel like if it's not Dontos who else could it be? Why introduce a new character everyone else at Kings Landing right now has been tainted in some way. In order for the reveal about LF it would have to be someone that people know nothing about but can believe may have a desire to help Sansa. My husband's an unsullied and he didn't find his return odd at all.
3138	Colonel Green	2014-04-08	Exactly. Baelish is gone. Somebody needs to get her out of KL and unless they want Sansa to come across like a complete broad, it better be someone who she has met before and who she has even the slightest reason to believe/trust.


They've completely taken Sansa's choices out of the equation, since she isn't a participant in the plan, so I don't think her trusting him really matters.
Â 
I expect they brought Dontos back because they want the scene where he dies (even though they've cut all the stuff that would have made his death shocking, since neither Sansa nor the audience has any real connection to him).

this. it establishes that sansa's no safer with littlefinger than she was with joffrey. also begins to establish sansa and littlefinger's roles in the new setting of the vale.
3140	SlowLoras	2014-04-08	Dontos killed me unexpectedly this episode with his line about the necklace. Part of me wishes it happened a little sooner - he's been gone from proceedings for quite a while by this point (not even a glimpse of him on his wooden horse!) But I think it'll be good for Sansa's character to have a confidante - someone to trust, as she's been surrounded by enemies and uncertain allies and sees no way home at this point.
Â 
My only concern is that the storyling may end up being terribly rushed. And I do hope they bring Jonquil/Florian into it, just as a nod to the mythology. I always found Dontos faintly creepy, but relating his devotion to the story of Florian and Jonquil at least gave it some kind of reasoning, as opposed to 'drunken old knight appears mildly besotted with child'.
3141	go joff go	2014-04-08	I think dontos was never a very interesting character so they made the smart decision and minimized his screentime. Maybe if the actor had just blown them away with his scenes they may have expanded his part, but he probably didn't stand out.
3142	When Harry met Sansa	2014-04-08	They're still following the text. In ASoS LF leaves KL but doesn't immediately go to the Eyrie and Dontos is the one who carries out the plan until he takes a crossbow to the gut and a swim to the bottom of the bay. Nothing has changed.

3143	dtones520	2014-04-08	As most have said, for two reasons. One, someone had to give Sansa the necklace with the poison. Two, someone has to get Sansa out of the Wedding and to Littlefingers ship. Who better than Ser Dontos?
3144	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-04-09	I was pretty certain Ros was going to replace Dontos so her death caught me off guard. I can see Dontos taking Marillion's place. Otherwise why bring a character back from two seasons ago that few people would remember just to off him in 2 or 3 scenes. I think he'll be sticking around for a bit.
3145	Woman of War	2014-04-09	Has there really been an issue with the actress EsmA© Bianco? And Dontos only stepped in as filler because they needed someone as intermediary in Sansa's escape? Does someone really know?
I think they introduced Dontos from the beginning to show us, just like Martin did, Joffrey's cruelty and one of the moments where the character of Sansa can sparkle. And using the fool to lure Sansa into that wonderful Florian and Jonquil story was the cream topping. So Dontos was never a waste of time in the show even if there was no plan to make use of his character further down the series.
Did they really intend to change the story and let Ros take up Dontos' part - and then,  for whatever reason, they decided to take out Ros?
3146	Rooseman	2014-04-09	How do so many people misunderstand what the problem is here?
Â 
Yes, Dontos serves as a proxy for Littlefinger, same as he did in the books. Which begs the question, why haven't they done that in Season 3? They made the decision to completely cut his storyline and replace him with Littlefinger himself. It was himÂ who promised Sansa to get her out of King's Landing, not Dontos.
Â 
I had my problems with that. For one, it ruined the twist that Littlefinger was Sansa's mysterious benefactor. In the book, it was a huge "what the fuck?"-moment when he appeared on that boat. Second problem is, it kind of ruins Littlefingers character. Here's this master player of the game, who is meticulously careful and always covers his tracks - meeting with Sansa, out in the open, where everybody could see him, plotting to get her out of King's Landing.
Â 
But they decided to go down that road, so: Okay. I imagine they had their reasons.
Â 
Which makes it absolutely mindboggling to introduce Dontos again in Season 4, because those changes from Season 3 which were problematic for many reasons are totally unnecessary now. Why take this detour and deviate from the book storyline, if it'll end up the same? Why not stick to what was in the books in the first place?Â
3147	eyeheartsansa	2014-04-09	My theory:Â He could have been absent from season 3 because of the actor's availability, or some other boring logistical thing beyond HBO's control. Â 
Â 
The game pieces are positioned for things to go down pretty much the same way. Â The biggest change is switching Loras with Willis because that has implications for Loras's status as the heir to Highgarden. Â However the writers addressed this last season by adding the scene between Tywin and QOT. Â It remains to be seen whether Loras will join KG and forfeit his inheritance, or the writers will come up with some other solution that makes sense within the context of the series. Â Maybe QOT can wield her influence to allow for an exception for Loras to be on KG and still keep his title; or he might be given some unofficial role where he does the same thing without the official KG post.
Â 
As for LF's involvement... It is not impossible to guess, since the show has already established that LF is sent to marry Lysa, and that he has a thing for Catelyn. Â When I read ASOS I was not terribly surprised to see LF at that point. Â Compared to all the twists and turns in the story, this is not that huge of a twist. Â

3148	jet199	2014-04-09	Dontos hasn't actually told Sansa to have a change of clothes ready or that he is going to get her out of KL yet so I assume we will have a scene in the next episode where Sansa learns she is going to escape. Hopefully the scene is the first episode is just to establish who Dontos is then they can reveal why he is there in the next. I think a few people are going to be surprised that an inept drunk can get Sansa out of KL when the greatest minds in Westeros couldn't and then they will be surprised again when his backer is revealed. I just hope that Sansa actually has to do something to aid her own escape rather than Dontos just dragging her off during the wedding.Â 

	Spoiler Hopefully the sarcy "we have a new queen" comment from Sansa in the episode 2 promo indicates that Sansa doesn't care about being polite any more because she knows she is leaving.
3149	Vvornth	2014-04-09	Spoiler The idea that Dontos will replace Marillion's role in The Vale is pretty compelling. When Mrs. Dingbat goes sailing out the moondoor someone has to take the fall (pun intended).
3150	catstory	2014-04-09	Correct me if I am wrong, but hasn't the singer Marrillion already been in the series when Tyrion was being taken to the Eyrie? If this is correct, then I think Marrillion will still have the same role when LF and Sansa arrive. I think LF taking over of the Eyrie will happen in this season, or come close. Of course that would mean they would have run out of LF and Sansa material to use in season 5 unless they use material coming in Winds of Winter.Â
3151	catstory	2014-04-09	I disagree about this Ros speculation. Two reasons: 1) Why have Dontos at all if not to bring him back? All named/speaking characters need to have a role in the plot or else they are not used in series.Â 
2) It is too obvious to have Ros approach Sansa since we all know Ros works for LF. The writers are working hard to not reveal some of the big plot twists for non-readers. Savvy non-readers will be wondering what Dontos is all about. But I don't think he will reveal who he works for until he tries to get Sansa to flee. Then he will get killed after she escapes.
Â 
It is LFs people who killed him in the books, right?

Â  Marrillion got his tongueÂ cut out by Joffrey in Ep. 10.

Â 
Mayhaps Ros was going to be our Marillion and Dontos was always going to be Dontos? That way LF blaming Ros would have been more horrifying/surprising for us?
Â 
I suppose a tongueless Marillion or NewBard#2 could be the one LF blames the murder on now (not like Marillion could deny it), but from a narrative standpoint, Dontos might be a better choice. Although I do love his death on the boat in terms of shock-value and LF characterization.

The main problem is people thatÂ genuinely think they would of made a such a change without first securing theÂ actressÂ to do it.Â 
Dontos's main function is being doneÂ for the show.Â Â WeÂ may not get Florent the Foll, we are also not getting an adult male trying to alwaysÂ kiss a young teen.Â

3155	catstory	2014-04-09	I did not recognize that the bard who got his tongue cut out was Marillion. Of course it was not him in the books. I still don't see Dontos going to the Eyrie. There needs to be several minor named/speaking characters to die, and he seems ripe for it.Â
3156	GHOSTSTARK	2014-04-10	imo to introudce him to the fan base again cause we saw so little of him at the end of season 1 or begining of season 2 i forget and to kind of give some background to who Dontos is and why hes there. im sure next scene with him in it will have more of a reasoning to the story
3157	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-04-10	Who the fuck else is going to take Sansa to Littlefinger?
3158	boojam	2014-04-10	Poor Tony Way , he gets a scene in season 2 E1, a microsecond in S2E9, and probably went on the cutting room floor S2.From the way things seem to be playing out he will only get two episodes in S4!He is a 'flash' character!
3159	Illusive_Man	2014-04-10	I found Dontos's story from the books very drawn out.Â  He never really add much since every conversation with Sansa was alway for her to wait and that time was not right.Â  I doubt Tv audiences would have tolerated that for the better part of 2.5 seasons.Â  TV wise I think LF would have hired him after giving Ros to Joffrey.Â  I do not think that LF knew Ros to be informing on him to Varys, which was the reason Ros died.Â

I tend to agree that delaying it at least a bit would be a good idea (though it still leaves you with the issue of Blackwater and why she doesn't go with the Hound, something that for a lot of viewers never made sense in the show, between omitting Dontos and downplaying the Hound's violent temperament so much) -- this show has enough storylines that are molasses-slow.Â  But reducing it to this was a mistake for Sansa's characterization (though even in truncated form they still could have given her some agency, but chose not to).

Â 
Â 
Not leaving with Hound I found to be understandable from Sansa's perspective.Â  While we the veiwers and readers see it as a mistake, look from Sansa's prespective.Â  The Hound is known n almost every village for his brutality, only second to his brother.Â  Would anyone in her shoes, in a middle of a siege would just get up and go with the realm's second most known butcher?Â 
Â 
The first time reading through the books Dontos's story arch barely inched forward until the impending royal wedding.Â  In addition Sansa in the books was better at hiding the proposed plot to be married to Willas from everyone.Â  It helped that he was in Highgarden, but in the show she might as well had a signed on her saying she was going to marry Loras.Â  I doubt Littlefinger needed his spy to screw Loras to have learned about the marriage proposal.Â  Although it gave us the wonderful exchange between Tywin and Olenna Tyrell.Â 
Â 
I just don't see how many times in 2 seasons for Dontos can tell his Jonquil that the time is not right.Â  It could have been better served if Dontos fist came to Sansa after her wedding to Tyrion, but prior to the Red Wedding.Â  Littlefinger through his network of spys would have seen Sansa in a pretty low morale, ripe for a plot of being taken away from KL.

Â 
Agree with all of this. Also to add to why Sansa didn't go with the Hound, Show!Shae had just told her that Stannis (who everyone assumed would sack KL) wasn't going to hurt her, and would pretty much be her ticket out of there. This was pretty much true; Stannis would have wanted to help Ned Stark's daughter, even if he viewed her brother as a usurper.
Â 
Dontos maybe should have come back last season, especially because at that point, they knew they were writing out Ros. The Dontos scene on Sunday ended up being a bit awkward, and I'm sure confusing for the Unsullied.
3163	Jairion Lannister	2014-04-08	Anyone else like the fact that we got a scene between the father and son before Joffrey dies presumably next week? I know there's obvious complications to Jaime and Brienne getting to KL early, but I really liked the fact that we got a scene between Jaime and Joffrey since it never happens in the book.
Â 
Will be interesting to see Jaime's reaction to his sons death. Obviously he doesn't care all too much in the books, and he won't exactly be distraught in the show, but it'll be interesting to see if it's any different since he'll actually be there.
