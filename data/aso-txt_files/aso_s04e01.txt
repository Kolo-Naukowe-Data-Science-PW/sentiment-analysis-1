"Dany's Silver",2014-04-06,"910 â i thoroughly enjoyed this episode and thats not just the vino talkingâ i will enjoy it even more when i rewatch it and i am definitely happy to have this show back on the air"
"Zman1863",2014-04-06,"it was ok a bit slow throughout most but that was pretty much expected curious about how they are going to frame aryas arc this season since they moved up one of the biggest scenes wasnt too much of the stuff they did with jaime due to his arriving in kl earlyâ"
"SeA±or de la Tormenta",2014-04-06,"210 i hated those thenn"
"Liddle",2014-04-06,"very good premiere best since the first season oberyn martells introduction was a little over the top but his discussion with tyrion was excellent i really liked aryas scene at the end it was definitely a better adaptation than i expected given the ticklers death in season two jons scene was ok sansadontos was a bit rushed but at least theyre setting up for the future jaimes scenes were pretty good and i liked what little we had of brienne there are a couple of weakish points to the episode the reforging of ice was done with little fanfare but the series hasnt made much of the importance of those ancestral weapons the introduction of the thenns felt a little clunky daenerys was just kind of there and so was tyrion i felt but i know not everybody can have action every episode  things take some setting up"
"Darth Pipes",2014-04-06,"910â great jobâ and i wasnt annoyed by muchâ always a good thing"

"Lord Godric",2014-04-06,"id give it an solid 8â a really good episode overall i really loved the opening with twin but some of the changes ugh such a purist i didnt like particularly tyrions welcoming of oberyn"
"SeA±or de la Tormenta",2014-04-06,"â that gets it a 210plus the lack of magic with neds sword as if it doesnt want to be splited the still ewing dallas view of the lannister family the noyed allister thorne which neglets further book cool scenes and the awful way they are doing the shae storyetc"
"The Shadow Wolf",2014-04-06,"had to give it a ten just for the ending alone loved arya sticking it to polliver almost felt like a dany ending with the got theme in the background and arya riding away on her white horse"
"KalibakCruel",2014-04-06,"910 as far as openers go this is my favorite since the season 1s loved aryas scene liked all of jaimes scenes and oberyn is looking good already"
"Widows_Blood",2014-04-06,"i gave it a ten because i am high on joy right now honestly id give it a 9 thenn introduction was great kit harington was great red viper intro was spot on arya and the hound was icing on the cake i also loved the shot of the destroyed countryside at the end one quibble i have had with this show is that they have sort of neglected how the war has impacted the small folk so i am very glad that we will get a look into that though arya and the houndâ"
"TheWhiteRabbit",2014-04-06,"thought it was the best season opener since season 1 especially the last part"
"Batavian",2014-04-06,"10 out of 10 â fantastic casting of pedro pascal as the red viper really looking forward to following oberynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s storyline in the series â looks like the cg has improved too with the increase in popularity of the series drogon is the coolest dragon since the stopmotion vermithrax of dragonslayer refreshing after the hugely disappointing portrayal of smaug in that other epic fantasy â it will be interesting see how well michiel huisman does i think the daario recast will be more significant than the other major recast in season 4"
"Died a Hero",2014-04-06,"9 â loved the open tywin putting the wolf pelt in the flame was a great touch the red viper was very red viper i know the prudes on the board will piss and moan but oberyns track is one of sex and blood get used to it poor sansa marge and gandma kickass picked up right where they left off shea the funny whore was meh but shes always meh loved the thenn my little brother was freaked the fucked out when he saw them i didnt mind the ayra change up on the time line itll hurry the bond between her and the hound so tv onrly folks see what the payoff is on episode 9 all and all good stuff great to have our baby back â edit oh the pointing child nvm that made this a 10 i cant believe they didnt cut it out sure it wasnt an infant but good enough edited by died a hero 06 april 2014  1131 pm"
"P. frontalis chiripepe",2014-04-06,"id say 85 â â love seeing aemon back i enjoyed bronn and sandors lines i think oberyns introduction was perhaps laid on a bit thick but i think he plays the part well shae is getting pretty jealouswe know what that means â"

"Jslay427",2014-04-06,"didnt really like the brienne and jamie exchange about sansa hard to do anything else due to the pw having taken place in the books before jamie gets to kl wanted him to be like i will keep this vow and save her still a 910"
"Jabronius Maximus",2014-04-06,"id give an 85 but i just rounded up to a 9 i thought it was great aside from danys scenes im not a fan of book dany so theres some obvious bias but i just thought her scenes were lacking"
"Howling Mad",2014-04-06,"oberyn martells introduction was one of the best of the series well done"
"KalibakCruel",2014-04-06,"oh id like to add in that kits acting in this episode in the little he was in is miles better than hes been all series long lol maybe it was just me but i actually believed his acting today especially when he talked about eating with the wildlings also liked the thenns"

"modbelle",2014-04-06,"910 based highly on oberyn stabbing random lannister supporter the badass of his performance and unpredictability got me plus i know the episode is good when it feels like a half hour rather than an hour"
"KalibakCruel",2014-04-06,"hes not just so emo he now has a strong personality yeah thats a perfect way to put it hes not sulking anymore cant wait to see how he does in the rest of the season â also not a fan of new naharis not as arrogant as skrein"
"dtones520",2014-04-06,"i thought the whole episode was strong outside of the tyrionshae scene but thats just more with me not liking how they have portrayed their romance but i never really understood it in the books either another tiny annoyance was that they spelled ser as sir in the white book show watchers had no idea and im willing to be the art designer who made it didnt either but as a book fan i cringed for a split second no big deal just a petty complaint i loved the entire introduction of the dornish and prince oberyn painted his character points perfectly for non readers as a lustful vengeful dangerous man who will do whatever he wants when he wants his monologue about elia was pure gold only wish they mentioned rhaenys and aegons names in it but i get not wanting to muddy the water with more and more names all at once love the casting of ellaria too actress is gorgeous jons scene was great like the new daario brought dontos back into the fold and he gave sansa her purple jewels loved aryas revenge the hound had me in stitches the thenns were badass everything was great still not 1010 great but a solid 9"
"King Kev.",2014-04-06,"very solid 9 â good set up for future events that will take place in the later episodes and some genuinely amazing scenes oberyn was fantastic and i loved it when he stabbed that guy the final scene was brilliant as well it took its sweet time ratcheting up the tension and it paid off i almost started laughing ecstatically during that fight excellent"

"ohpooratlas",2014-04-06,"i gave it a 7 but im admittedly a very hard grader â it was by far the best premier since the first season loved oberyns introduction loved the aryahound scene loved the dragons  especially loved drogon snapping at dany  i jumped just like she did loved and hated all at the same time the breaking down of ice â loved jon snows scene too and i agree that kit did a fantastic job with it â i also loved margaerys sarcastic comment about joffrey choosing a string of dead sparrows for her necklace and how the qot immediately put her in her place and was like hush your tongue dear even with me"
"Fez",2014-04-06,"910 â thats partly because im just so excited that the shows back but i also think the episode did a really good job of catching nonreaders up with a lot of backstory and setting up most of the major plotlines of the season"
"The Great Unwashed",2014-04-06,"i gave the episode a 710 unfortunately the scenes with jaime i felt were rather lacking since theyre having to invent scenes for him since they sped up his arrival oberyn seems like he will be interesting but i felt the scene between him and tyrion lacked much of the elegance and tension of their first meeting in the novel i felt jons scenes were good although i would have liked to see more of his reaction to the news regarding robb kit harington really seems to be more comfortable as jon danys scenes were meh although i think the new actor playing daario is a better pickalthough my better half was less than pleased the scene with tyrion and sansa was very good i felt"
"Montey14",2014-04-06,"although the books only hint and vaguely mention that red viper lies with boyshe is openly bisexual in the series"

"The Monkey",2014-04-06,"i loved it all the aryahound scene was obviously the highpoint but all the scenes were good especially the oberyn ones also gotta agree with yall kit gave a real solid performance here it bodes well for the rest of the seasonâ â do you think they will ever explain why allister thorne returned in the show without ever having visited kl in the show"

"Ser Creighton",2014-04-06,"changed a lot from the books a little over the top i give it a 7 though i know jaime is not acting like he should from the books but i can see where it is going with his character it seems to make sense pros arthur dayne dunk flower power dragons new darrio better than old darrio production values wolf pelt on the fire joff touching the white book so wrong but so perfect he won the war and broke stannis i was waiting for him to write his own name in the book dead child cons brie and marg wtf oh high its great to meet you nothing odd here nothing like grey tyrion oh wait thats the books over the top oberyn not to bad but a little pushy skipped the tyrion story would have liked that arya felt a little early for that jump in brutality at least for me the necklace from ser dontos nothing really bad for me except the brie and the tyrell moment just some things that felt a bit out of place nothing really spectacular dragons looked good some nice book drops had a nice feel to it liked dontos a lot more than i thought i would it was good with some very good moments not sure what else to say"

"BrettStark",2014-04-06,"loved the episode i wish people didnt always compare the show to the books saying why didnt this or that happen ive read all the books  i love the show just as much people need to start viewing the show as its own entity personally i even wish sometimes that the show would skew even more from the books if everything was exactly the same it wouldnt be as enjoyable to me because id already know what has happened â great episode i loved oberynâ"
"KalibakCruel",2014-04-06,"am i the only one so far that doesnt like new daario i see people saying they like him i really dont so far i know its early but hes not arrogant enough and hes missing that edge that cocky swagger the smirk the walk i dont know i just dont know"

"Queen of Whores",2014-04-06,"a very solid 7 out of 10 the best premiere since season 1 but i guess thats not saying much since the other two were very average â the good â  the arthur dayne and duncan the tall namedrops were so awesome easily my favourite things of the episode  some of the hounds lines were hilarious like what the fuck is a lommy those people are cunts and i dont care if heâ ateâ your friend  cool to see the dreadfort and meereen in the intro  i may have had to suppress a little fanboy giggle when doran and sunspear were namedropped  the cgi at the end of that whole wartorn landscape was pretty amazing  even though it was kind of random and short i really liked the sansadontos scene it was cool to have him hint at the history of house hollard and finally sansa is getting back to her old notthatdumb self â the meh â  oberyns introduction the entire scene in the brothel was completely pointless and served no purpose i also didnt like oberyn brutally attacking that lannister guy sure he was a dick but cmon we will see oberyns a badass later  the margaerybrienne scene was completely pointless since margaery already doubted brienne killed renly when loras convinced her  emilia continues to be an actress with zero range of tone and expression and it made her scenes very dull  the jaimetywin confrontation was a bit underwhelming compared to how i thought it would be â the bad â  olenna tyrell is seriously getting very annoying and unfunny at this point she is coming across less witty and more bitchy every episode â when thats the only thing thats not that good about an episode though im generally pretty happy a really good premiere and hopefully the season continues with this quality edited by queen of whores 06 april 2014  1159 pm"
"4th Dragon Head",2014-04-06,"710 â only bc i hold this show to a higher standard compared to most other tv shows every got episode getsâ 1010 but compared to other episodes of this show this gets a 7 â i understand that they wanted to go ahead and give us more context for oberyn and how he is but his intro compared to the book intro was not nearly as good the banter between him and tyrion while riding into kl was one of my favorite moments from the book and i am a little disappointed that we didnt get to see that play out on the screen but like i said i get it he will only be in 7 or 8 episodes so they had to hurry up and explain his character to non readers â i wasnt crazy about the jamie scenes either its going to be interesting having him there for what is about to happen â other than that it was good great to finally be back in westeros even if its only for 9 more weeks"

"shiola",2014-04-06,"hard for me to rate without a rewatch but my initial thoughts â good  no dialogue in the opening scene  kits acting  cersei being more insane cerseis heavier drinking being referenced  sassy aemon â sassy jon  the hound â everything about the hound â all the timeâ  maisie â everything about maisie â all the time  the dreadfort looking badass in the opening credits  oberyn being intimidating as fuck  shout outs in the kingsguard â take it or leave it  olennas fangirling over brienne  something about either the pacing or scene transitions or the way scenes were spread throughout the episode â something felt a bit off â a rewatch will improve this  the hairnet becoming a necklace â how can she subtly lose a gem off of the necklace and not notice it during the wedding â the hairnet was really sneaky â the necklace is more obvious â but i suppose thats the point for tv â plus no one on the show ever wears hairnets â a necklace is more what were used to seeing â  im undecided as to whether i like aryas overkill in the books inn scene or aryas slow calculating cold killing on the tv inn scene â how many how many how many stuck with me and it was really powerful â but on the other hand we got an overkill scene of her with the frey last finale â plus the slow killing shows a lot of insight into how shes changing  im happy brienne was in the premier but i didnt like any of her scenes  im glad theyre continuing to set up shae â coming off of a rewatch of seasons 2 and 3 though shes like a broken record â she says the same paranoid shit over and over again â had i not just seen those seasons i know id be less bothered â bad  the slow reveal that the thenns were cannibals â by the time they panned down to the arm i thought the ominous tone was kind of overdone to the point it was almost silly â other than that the thenns were pretty good â this is a really stupid complaint i know  new daario â old daario delivered his lines in such an over the top kind of poetic way but it seemed natural and he was on the right side of the sexy vs sleazy line â altogether i thought old daario captured what mattered about book daario â new daario has no charisma  tywin vs jaime â i thought the book dialogue was better and they could have borrowed more from it â the scene felt rushed â  jaimes haircut â im thinking it felt like a 710 for me â but a rewatch would definitely put it higher so ill just vote 8 edited by shiola 06 april 2014  1152 pm"

"Rashtibram",2014-04-07,"this was a pretty excellent episode on the whole especially when you consider that its a season premiere arguably the most difficult to write and direct its already noticeable that the absence of robbcat and the merging of the jaimebrienne and kings landing arcs is a huge advantage for the showrunners and the concise nature of the episode almost exclusively focusing on the various kl relationships and dany really helped to give it a sense of momentum and pacing which last seasons valar dohaeris lacked a couple of frustrating â<U+0080><U+0093> albeit minor â<U+0080><U+0093> flaws kept it from surpassing season 2s the north remembers still imo the best premiere so far but i can honestly say that this episode succeeded in meeting my high expectations in spectacular style and next week looks even better â edited to add a couple of specifics i pretty much loved all of the kings landing scenes the wordless artfully directed cold opening the nice bit of fanservice in the white book scene everything sansa whose characterization looks to be right back on track with the books jaime struggling to find himself with brienne and cerseiâ<U+0080>the list goes on on my first viewing oberyns introduction seemed quite cheesy and over the top and there are still certain aspects of the scene that i question but upon a second rewatch it definitely holds up i think i was a bit jaded by my prior knowledge of the character but as an introduction id say it worked and it certainly did its job in the memorability department anyway his subsequent interaction with tyrion had me nearly jumping out of my seat in a wave of fanboy craze so theres something â with regards to dany the sequence with the dragons was excellent â<U+0080><U+0093> the special effects team outdoes themselves once again â<U+0080><U+0093> but daarios recasting created a jarring and disconcerting atmosphere as they seem to have changed his personality as well as his physical appearance from strong and poetic to generically masculine all of danys scenes on their own were quite good but this blaring inconsistency just took me out of the world whenever daario was onscreen â the tavern brawl was imo one of the best sequences the show has done to date while im still not sure about the adaptation choice having the hound injured in a different way presumably to extend the popular relationship between him and arya the writing acting and directing were all superb and on the whole brilliantly pulled off a scene which could easily have seemed redundant as we already saw a glimpse of aryas brutality in 3x10 and otherwise the only legitimate plot development was her recovery of needle pretty much every detail of the scene deserves a mention in the positive nitpick thread and thats saying something â arguably the weakest aspect of the episode was the arc at the wall i was slightly indifferent to the jon scene it mostly just seemed like a bit of a let down after the implications of his material in last seasons finale and i was undoubtedly left with a couple of nagging questions did sam ever tell jon that he met his brother at the nightfort and why was maester aemon just able to effortlessly override thorne who is apparently acting lord commander in the show but on the whole it wasnt enough to be a real detriment to the episode the thenns on the other handâ<U+0080>i guess there wasnt really anythingâ badâ about their introduction per se but the cartoonish reveal that they were cannibals wasnt handled well to say the least and there were times when it felt like they had gotten lost on their way to do battle with leonidas and the 300 spartans â overall though despite my quibbles i really did love this episode i debated my rating for quite some time after holding it at a seven for a while in a rush of initial its finally here excitement i eventually decided against speaking such high praise so early in the season â<U+0080><U+0093> especially when said season has so many spectacular episodesevents to look forward to â<U+0080><U+0093> and gave it a solid six which is actually a good score for me i havent given out a ten yet and blackwater is the only episode so far to have pulled a nine soâ<U+0080> â 610 â two swords falls 18th out of 31 on my list of besttoworst got episodes â sidenote my friend gets her first cameo as one of margaery tyrells cousins shes the one the camera focuses on when olenna tells them to go speak to the jewelers of kings landing edited by haldir monark 20 april 2014  0713 am"

"Pod The Impaler",2014-04-07,"one of my favourite scenes in the series thus far â the hedgespying  well done but completely outshone by the what the fuck is a lommy line â â aryas first kill was great and her second was just brilliant i would have just liked to have seen a tad more menace in the first kill  something reminiscent of briennes two quick deaths but definitely no complaints from me â and the closing  showing the desolation of the riverlands this was a key part of aryas story in the books  it served to show the suffering of the smallfolk i felt this was missing somewhat in the previous seasons but i am really happy they have gone that way now â â i think i agree with the kinkslayer i would have preferred a is there gold in the village reference since polliver was one of her harrenhal captors  torturers as well what she did here in the show also relates to a later event  negating it  â plus i hope the harrenhal reference isnt lost in her dialogue with the hound later she was the mountains prisoner and tywins cupbearer ffs "

"Karmarni",2014-04-10,"that torture line from polliver both arya and sandor know exactly what that meant from gregor and his men the camera shows both their faces and we know what must be going through their minds i think that will play a part later no never saw sandor as a rapist and neither does jaime in his adwd thoughts the show is all about the difference between the clegane brothers sandor is shouting that out to the brotherhood in his pretrial speech couldnt be plainer also pretty certain he wont die no book spoiler on that one and foreshadowed on the show with the have you found god sneer and the go in peace sandor clegane from beric as for the dying request for mercy all the hound has to do is say he failed to protect sansa that he meant to steal her and his regret for mycah that arya in the books says she cant even recall him that much is just grrm highlighting how regretful sandor must be perhaps he angers her in other ways on the show they arent playing by the books 100 obviously arya has had a few lines that seem to suggest she herself wishes she had cared more for sansa i recall the delivery of her line to jaqen and just for the record i too think sandor went to her room to take her with him that he asked for florian and jonquil because thats the song she said shed sing even though he initially was talking about singing in the asoiaf slang way at blackwater she couldnt look at him angered him and so he went for a real song it was all he was going to get and then he mustve assumed hed never see her again he does that in the same way as in dunk and egg he cries because hes leaving the show hound looked pretty sad to leave her too i am pretty certain theyll go there with that"
"iknownothingjonsnow",2014-04-10,"i thought the dialogue was weird and kinda lame i know its not a popular opinion i enjoyed the scene during the show loved the whole episode but i didnt get the chicken joke i also guess i was expecting a more heated confrontation like in the novels thats funny  i thought the setup and aftermath were tremendous but the fight itself was both horribly conceived and executed â the shaky handheld camera made it difficult to follow the action and made me nauseous â it was confusing to see arya stand there doing nothing for 90 of the brawl did she think that things would have ended well for her after they killed the hound â sandor is fighting with 3 guys at once but rather than finish any of them off he knocks each them to the ground allowing them to recover and overtake him despite being flat on his back on the ground he suddenly morphs to his feet and pops into frame from out of nowhere to step on a guys sword and punch him in the face â then we have my favorite part despite having rather easily handled these guys in 2on1 and 3on1 situations sandor finds himself 1on1 with the smallest of the bunch  so of course the guy takes him to the ground with almost no effort at all â luckily for the hound however the guy decides not to kill him but rather rest the blade of his knife on sandors neck while he recovers â he pushes the guys head away which accomplishes nothing as the knife blade is still easily within range of his neck but eventually the hound regains the upper hand â a little pokey pokey to the face arya finally wakes up executes the weirdest and slowest stabbing in the history of sword fighting and our good friend polliver decides to ignore the loud smashing of the vase and screaming of his friend being killed 8 feet behind him and take a very casual stroll in the opposite direction â hes slashed from behind falls face first to the ground is unable to scramble away but manages to flip onto his back to facilitate a close up and some dialogue with his killer â i read someone describe it as amateur hour and i couldnt agree more"

"Khal Porno",2014-04-09,"what has tyrion done so far in the show that is morally questionableemploying bronn seriously ive had this debate so many times im really sick of itâ tyrion has been portrayed as a selfish hedonist who for a good bit of the show only had his own selfinterest at heart hes been dishonest and underhanded when he felt it was necessary sincerely threatened people with harm or death multiple times caused peoples deaths to save himself and been sexually attracted to and tempted to have sex with a fourteen year old girlâ thats all morally questionable in my opinion edited by khal porno 09 april 2014  0127 am"

"Seer of Green",2014-04-09,"ive always felt that in the case of adapting a book series asoiaf to a multiseason tv show got deviations are born out of necessity for many reasons one issue is having aging actors portraying children that remain young in the books another example is having to deal with a filming budget there are many vital scenes in the books that would just be way to expensive to film grrm has even gone on record saying that some of the changes dd made were actually better than what grrm had written for instance martin has said that he liked the way the character of bronn was portrayed on the show better than the way he wrote then you have instances where deviations were made just because certain scenes were simply drawn out loo long and could possibly lose the viewers attention but there are certain deviations that i just dont like andor agree with for instance i dont like how much the sequence of dany in the house of the undying deviates from the source material theres just so much that happens at the house of the undying that becomes the foundation for rlj that was completely absent from the way the scene played out on the show if the rlj theory is indeed true i wonder how dd are going to plant that seed in the viewers mind when its so vital in the book anyway thats just my 2 cents i think most of the deviations work because they were pretty much a necessity but i do agree that some were unnecessary and in some cases as mentioned completely change the future of the series"

"TaenaOfMyr",2014-04-12,"ill say that maybe im a bit biased as i watched the first 3 seasons of the show before reading the books so its the show that got me into this series not the books as im sure was the case for many of you but i think dd have done a great job with the adaption and i think were deluding ourselves if we ever think well get a better adaption than this is it 100 perfect no but considering how this could have turned out considering how other adaptions of books have worked out ex dune as mentioned by others while there have been areas where the producers have produced mediocre material i think often times there have been sufficient reasons behind them for example the ramsaytheon storyline the storyline involving ramsay in book 2 was one of my favorite parts of that book and it was left entirely out on the tv show then season 3 was spent with a long drawn out plotline which was largely just theon being tortured ramsays identity was kept secret until the final episode which just was not that much of a tv plotline payoff yet i do think the producers had legitimate reasons to go about things in the way they did it would have been difficult to fit in the ramsay storyline in season 2 with everything else going on completely leaving theon out of the entire season and telling things later in flashbacks like they did in the books would not have worked out on the tv show not narratively and not in an industry where you can have a character of the level of theon simply be left out for an entire season likely 2 without having a huge risk that you lose the actor and keeping ramsays identity a secret makes sense when you consider that they wanted to keep roose boltons betrayal a secret and doing so made it more of a shock i think in general they still errd with the storyline but they had reasons for doing so something that you are going to have in an adaption to this medium regardless of who is doing it the shows also shown the ability to improve on certain storylines aryas storyline in the show has been a big improvement over the books we got the arya  tywin scenes which werent in the books arya completely wastes her first 2 jaqen deaths in the books and they made them much more notable and important to the plot in the show and aryas storyline drags quite a bit in book 3 before sandor kidnaps her and they were able to speed up that storyline in strong fashion its not perfect but i think theyre doing a terrific job"

"Ser Desmond Wine's Bane",2014-04-13,"well someone once said this â â then ill try to explain it again in this conversation there are two different facets to character development how consistent it is with previous development and whether or not the characterisation comes up again this results in a few different types of characterisation moments â  the first is your standard characterisation it both makes sense with what weve seen of the character before and it has an impact on the plot this is good writing  the second is hidden depths it initially seems contradictory to the characterisation weve seen previously but it continues to have some impact on the plot and so becomes part of the character this is good writing â it seems to me the aryatywin scenes did add to her character on both of these points â sure i would have preferred her story to progress closer to as it had in the books but i fear the constant terror would have worked on screen many people seem to have had a negative reaction to theons scenes describing it as torture porn etc â the point i am addressing isnt her arc over the season as a whole only the claim that the aryatywin scenes were badly written on points that disregarded arya edited by ser desmond wines bane 13 april 2014  0621 am"
"Treekid",2014-04-13,"i think the show on his own is very good i sometimes dont understand why some changes are made but i try not to think too much about the book when i watch so that i can enjoy the show as a separate piece of art â and so far i have only felt frustrated at how they handled the whole house of the undying episode i liked the reunion scene between dany and drogo but hated that they had to have the dragons kidnapped and the thirteen killed and the black guy cant remember his name in the book locked in his safe i understand that prophecies are difficult to show because we would actually see the characters involved whereas in the book we have to guess but they could have hinted at the rw in a million other ways for instance i would have loved to see raegar too edited by treekid 13 april 2014  0617 am"
"Lontra",2014-04-13,"but its very possible that its been mentioned on the show more than im thinking and im just not remembering all im saying is that i dont think that its been hinted at enough on the show for those who only watch the show to know who prince oberyn is referring to when he says for another woman sorry to reply so late but ive been busyâ just so you knowâ my husband is unsulliedâ he knew who oberyn was talking aboutâ he said that he thought there was more to the story because of the way ned seemed uncomfortable when robert b talked about lyanna and rhaegar in season 1â he also has suspicions that jon is her son because of the way that ned was careful to say you are my blood and not you are my son to jon in season 1â of course my husband is brilliant   and may not be typical but it is possible for people to get a hint from the show im dying to tell him all about it but i dont want to spoil it for him"
"eyeheartsansa",2014-04-14,"â actually one of the biggest complaints about those scenes and aryas season two arc in general is that she has virtually no character development from arriving at harrenhal up until forming the plan to leave rather than the constant terror she must endure in the books shes got a reasonably comfortable position serving tywin drinks ran and linda go into it a fair bit in their season 2 reviews i actually bought up the lack of aryas development earlier in the thread and no one ever replied to it really i just assumed that we were all in agreement that arya had gotten no development in those scenes and just moved on â serving drinks to tywin lannister and making eye contact with lf knowing that people are looking for you sounds pretty uncomfortable  terrifying to me â in the book she still has the cushy role of roose boltons cupbearer so i dont see much difference â we see more development in her interactions with jaquen especially when she tricks him into getting another death to help her escape â i think virtually no character development is an unfounded criticism and if you were to watch season 2 again closely and stop worrying so much about the books or the purpose of every individual scene you might see it a little differently edited by eyeheartsansa 14 april 2014  1251 am"
"Peter George Stewart",2014-04-15,"â in another show you would be right but in such a tightly plotted series such as game of thrones and an adaptation i really dont think theres any time for these kind of scenes every scene which is just banter is time which could be used to more faithfully adapt the books which would make for better television imo and even if this were dds own ip it would still be time that could be spent giving the plot and characterisation that much more depth i love witty dialogue but in got it needs to be slotted into other scenes which serve a functional purpose scenes whose sole purpose is banter are just bad writing imoâ â no with tv its more important to get into the characters the plot largely takes care of itself and even the asoiaf plots could be written on the back of an envelope if you look at them in essentialsâ but if people watching dont engage with the characters then what they do is meaningless â now given that obviously as many have pointed out you cant have all the inner monologue that gives us a rounded picture of characters so we care about them in the books it has to be done through dialogue and visually â its a great adaptation that respects the books loves the books but uses its own mediums storytelling ways to tell basically the same story with basically the same characters though some are more and some less fleshedout in the books and some invented"

"'96Buck",2014-04-11,"so while i was riding home in the rain and mud last night i had a few thoughts about jons timeline in the book and the current tv series im a little concerned about the nature of his role at castle black given that â hes come back from his journey with the wildlings but they arent actually hot on his heels therefore there wont be the small battle in castle black itself  with the thenns in the tv show they are waiting for mances attack rather than trying to be able to just open the gates for him janos slynt bowen marsh and the other high officers are already back at castle black given jon the once over before he has any chance to prove himself in battle like he does in the books jon will now have no reason to hold the wall during mances attack on the gates as donal noye wont have had that responsibility himself nor give it to him and then die in the tunnels fighting mag the mighty its this show of leadership imo that is a key reason jon is able to be elected to the role of lorn commander without this experience hes just a lad who went off and killed the halfhand and hung around with the wildlings therefore jons future position as lc will be ridiculous on the basis of the internal narrative causality being played out in the tv show i think theyve butchered the story too much for the sake of added drama and are destroying the internal consistency required to carry on the storylineâ unless of course that storyline isnt very important in the long run which who can really know â these dont seem to be insurmountable or even that difficult to resolve â â now that tormund is reinforced by the thenns they could easily raid castle blackâ what jon thinks is their plan may not be the actual plan or they could deviate from plan â the remaining officers could lead rangings north to evaluate jons tale or sams or head to the other nights watch castles with ease or be tricked into following tormundthenns who could raid and then retreat to draw off cb defendersâ jon would not be allowed to go as hes got a cloud of suspicion over him â once this distraction raid plan has been executed jon is one of few left to hold the gateâ which he then does and were right where we need to be"

"The Fourth Head",2014-04-08,"my first impression was that it was unnecessary styrs gait was too urukhai for my liking and it seemed over the top like the character assassination of a whole group of people â however in one fell swoop it humanised tormund brilliantly and tormund is more important as a character than styr i felt a ambivalent towards tormund in season 3 because he spent as much time threatening jon as he did playing with him now tormund is wholly sympathetic â but i dont think the benefits end there after all we are the readers of summer and winter has come i dont think canniballism does equal savagery we have been given a very unpleasant introduction to cannibals by styr but at this stage south of the wall cannibalism seems unnecessary and he will soon die we were given a very unpleasant introduction to jamie lannister too if i recall but he is fast becoming a hero despite throwing children out of windows grrm loves his grey â blatantly there is a growing trend towards canniballism in asoiaf hell who didnt cheer frey pie even southron fools and lords who who arent being portrayed as evil but as normal desperate men are partaking in eating the dead i suspect bran has unknowingly done the same and its the reason hes still alive if conducted in an organised manner with rules it could make the difference between the survival or death of a society where a leaders morals could doom his whole people and risk him being killed and eaten himself which could result in anarchy in fact i like the challenging concept that a cannibalistic society can also be a disciplined one furthermore we have yet to meet styrs son he may come across as slightly more palatable if you get my drift you have to be tough to survive in winter i think grrm will genuinely force us to consider cannibalism as a valid survival option without having to hate those who take part â this fits in perfectly with the changing attitude with time towards the thenns jon snow will need men on the walls he will need to appease styrs son as rations fall slim jon will be forced to either kill them all or risk them eating all the locals it cranks up the pressure on jon in adwd what better way to appease this group of well behaved cowed but dangerous prisoners than gifting them karstark lands and all the nonhuman food to be found there i doubt very much the magnar would tolerate his wife being eaten that doesnt make any sense at all and as we start to see how the wall can cooperate with cannibals who come across as fairly civilised afterall despite first impressions the insidious path towards embracing cannibalism will continue"

"Tobin",2014-04-08,"all of the sources in this are unreliable robert because of jealousy ned because of grief oberyn because of familial pride â kidnapped is the official story since robert was the king and therefore the accepted final word on the subjectâ there are a few other incidents where it is mentioned but most of those are directly in relation with roberts view of events and would fall under the kidnapping label i dont remember ned ever saying specifically that she was kidnapped but then it has been several years since ive reread everything â it would have been very possible oberyn to get a firsthand account from his sister by raven  there is plenty of time elapsed between the kidnapping and the sack of kings landing when elia was murdered it hadnt occurred to me before but the martells are the only family left that could have proof of what actually happened aside from howland reed"
"Bratchild",2014-04-08,"i believe ned told good ole bobbert that he had revenged lyanna on the trident â or words to that effect"
"Envie",2014-04-08,"its all about perspective to one side starks  baratheons â it was kidnapping but to the other martells it was cheating and abandonment against elia what rhaegar did with lyanna thats always been one of the biggest unsolved mysteries as well as whether or not jon snow might be a product of that rapelove affair between them or not rumors during the war were common for everything and of course oberyn hears and remembers it the way he wants to for his personal vendetta reasons  especially the parts about elia being raped by clegane and the children being killed so ruthlessly those are generally accepted to be true accounts but again its perspective just how graphic or horrific it really was based on which version you hear from which side of the war"

fair point the problem is it actually doesnt contradict anything i said in my post â i said rhaegar went off with lyanna  could have been an abduction or elopement â it isnt really important to my point that this adds evidence to the rlj fire â thats exactly what i started saying in my next post â so you quoted me in order to make a point which doesnt contradict anything i said in my initial post then you even claimed i heard what i wanted out of oberyns words â ironic you just did that with me and ive shown how i didnt do that with oberyn â so i respond saying that whether she eloped or kidnapped isnt important  because it wasnt to my point  the point is that rhaeger left with lyanna and they had at least a child thats now called jon snow â i wasnt trying to make any claim as to whether it was an abduction or not â â then you post telling me that im losing you here maybe i wasnt explaining things as clearly as i am now but i was making a post that was about rlj not about the abduction or not of lyanna but since you kept moving the argument to that point i eventually responded to that as many other posters like 96buck who made a concise but relevant post rhaegars interest in lyanna and apparent opportunity to father a child are establishedâ her return interest while morally preferable is not physically necessary â other posters like envie step in to basically guard the exact point that i made and were all making ill repeat again we all believe rlj we know it isnt confirmed and think this is a strong piece of evidence to throw in to the large file â â<U+0080><U+008B>you respond saying we are allâ desperately looking for any evidence for affirmation really â this oberyn conversation is desperate evidence â many posters immediately chimed in and had the argument you wanted to have and said that the conversation  despite its brevity  does indeed help show that oberyn doesnt believe she was kidnapped and forced to go against her will after all he calls rhaegar beautiful and noble and merely says that he left her for another woman â i just like many other posters think this very strongly implies that he didnt kidnap her youre right it doesnt literally mean that but it would be strange to say only this if you knew that rhaegar also kidnapped and raped lyanna â i personally didnt want to have that discussion with my initial post which was why your disagreement sounded a lot like rlj â but thanks for unnecessarily using my post to try and prove your point â coincidentally i do believe that rhaegar and lyanna eloped willingly but that one i believe less strongly than rlj â i was also confused by this bit of conversation  tsarrast on 11 apr 2014  1120 pm said her willingness to participate is not really the point  the fact that oberyn is discussing this independently is further confirmation of the event and the way he says it strongly implies that from his point of view rhaegar went off as part of a willing relationship and even the method they are dropping these clues on the show is pointing towards a later future reveal well thats where you lose me â if her willingness to participate isnt the point then how does anything he said in e01 all but confirm rlj â we already heard from one source that rhaegar kidnapped and ran off with lyanna â now we have from another source that rhaegar left his wife for another woman presumably lyanna â isnt rhaegar a willing participant in either scenario â this is one of your previous requotes where it appears you just want to start an argument how do i lose you â im saying that her willingness isnt important to to the point  and of course rhaegar is a willing participant in either scenario  his willingness to participate isnt a question  its her willingness to participate that isnt central to the rlj issue â either she was abducted or she absconded willingly  either way they went off together and i believe had jon snow â thats my point â thats what buck96 answered you saying as well â how is that unclear â and in another thread where it seems i was having the conversation you want to have i posted this to respond to you which you didnt seem to want to respond there despite the fact that you are answering every post i make in this thread â i just cannot believe that rhaegar kidnapped lyanna â firstly it doesnt fit rhaegars personality profile â he isnt one of the crazy targarayans he was bookwormish until he decided to take up fighting than he became a great fighter â all the povs that knew him well like selmy  all speak very highly about him especially that he was honorable â hes also the crown prince and a handsome man by all accounts â why on earth would he need or want to kidnap lyanna and run off with her â because he can â i dont buy that at all  and i dont think it makes sense â sure it hasnt been disproven  and it is what roberts saying  but robert is the most biased of basically everybody who discusses the subject  and it seems even ned doesnt want to confirm roberts pov on the subject â secondly lyanna isnt really the type to be kidnapped and just submit â shes discussed as a wild spirit one who perhaps wouldnt go along with a situation like that  would try escaping fight etc even abort the child in some way if she got pregnant through rape â now this is much more assumption on my part but i still think some of these things are possible and its further reason to discount the kidnap theory â it just makes a lot more sense that they ran off together â lyanna bc she was of course promised to robert who she told ned wouldnt change  it sounds like she didnt love him and rhaegar bc of course hes married already â it sounds like the type of thing that would be secret  happen suddenly  not discussed with others which is exactly how it sounds when you hear other characters talking about it â id love to bet anyone that believes she was kidnapped as much as they want at even money that if its ever proven through book canon that she eloped as opposed to being kidnapped â it just feels rather obvious edited by tsarrast 13 april 2014  0736 pm"

"Justin Danford",2014-04-06,"im rolling my eyes at this set up its the one thing i didnt like about the episode â i think the tv show made the shae character too strong and too likeable with the impending plotline that needs to change and it looks like the way its going to change is through a cliche misunderstanding where if either of the characters only spoke a bit more there wouldnt be so much of an issue that sort of plot device it contrived and only holds weight during onscreen time obviously time passes offscreen but this sort of plot device would have you believe these characters ever only meet in the scenes we see and thus fall further and further down a hole of unfortunately unlucky exchanges â  shae looks back and sees tyrion touch sansas hand in compassion mistakes it for love  tyrion too stressed to rustle the sheets with his girlfriend shae suspeccts a loss of interest  shae thinks it was tyrions idea to send her away tyrion acts bewildered doesnt get a chance to deny it â if that trend continues ill be dreading every shaetyrion scene except the last edited by justin danford 06 april 2014  1144 pm"
