"Lord Godric",2011-05-01,"i gave it an 8 i think i was expecting it to be a little better since they finally got to kings landing so i was slightly disappointed but still very very good"
"Starkess",2011-05-01,"it was okay i thought it was the weakest yet had really great individual scenes but didnt feel like anything happened"
"Zulithe",2011-05-01,"i thought it was about onpar with last weeks episode there were some great character moments just not a lot of progression totally dug it though next weeks episode looks a little shall i say chunkier"
"awesome possum",2011-05-01,"8 the plot was stagnant as the episode focused on characters but i dont have a problem with it it was entertaining and i understand the need to establish the characters further especially with the addition of several others i really liked roberts scene and syrio forel was perfect"
"Jojen",2011-05-01,"id give it a 7 even though there wasnt much plot progression there was a nice degree of character development and more great subtle expressions from sean bean especially while watching syrio and arya"
"Ran",2011-05-01,"tough one for me id say 758 but as i tend to have a tendency to round up in favor the show i decided this time id just put it as a 7 ive more detailed thoughts plus some notes about changes an added scenes here"
"Recentiy03",2011-05-01,"tonights episode was awesomeeasily my favorite of the season the show keeps getting better as they introduce more characters their writers are really goodthe dialogue is fresh but theyre keeping it interesting with a lot of subtle references to events for people whove read the books i loved the jaimened scene in front of the iron throne it was the best of the episode if not the seasonbut the robertlanceljaimeselmy scene was epicthe old nan scene was greatreally the only scene that was a bit off a letdown was the last scene with syrio but the fading shot of ned redeemed it the first few episodes were good but they showed their teeth tonight with a bit of grit edited by recentiy03 01 may 2011  1012 pm"
"tybeechris",2011-05-01,"i thought it was great they moved the plot along but also managed to work in enough of the background history that had been lacking and lay the groundwork for future actions by the main characters i really liked the jamie scenes he aint no angel but sure does seem like a lot of people like ned and robert were more than willing to profit from his dirty work the hour goes by way too fast"
"Wolfheart",2011-05-01,"i would give it a 7 because of the lack of the direwolves but i gave it a 8 because the acting was just great wheres ghost and summer heck even greywind"
"Brude",2011-05-01,"for me this was the best episode yet and i thought last weeks was better than the first i gave it an 910 i was very impressed with all of the new scenes mainly cersei with joff and best of all robert with his two knights those worked really well as did syrios scene with arya edited by brude 01 may 2011  1103 pm"
"Xenophon",2011-05-01,"gave it an 8 to me it was about the same as episode 2 episode 1 still had the most drama and felt most like a ministory but these were more engrossing and had better character development and they didnt have the ghastly dothraki wedding or softcore porn feel which were minuses in my book so im at 788 for the season id be interesting in knowing how other people ranked the other episodes too"
"Carldog",2011-05-01,"65 rounded up to 7 on the thread this episode seemed a bit clustered with a lot of back and forth but also had some great character scenes not as good as last week but like a ive stated before its great to see agot on my tv screen ill take what i can get"

"Timbits",2011-05-01,"the first two episodes were very fast pace there was a great deal of action and sex which resulted in a lack of character development this episode however blew me away by how good it was finally it is focusing on characters and storyline they are having conversations instead of just spitting out important lines from the books the dialog seems more natural and the acting was stronger great performances from tyrion jon cersei and arya i feel like they bring something to their character like their own point of view of them and its extremely interesting to watch edited by timbits 01 may 2011  1154 pm"
"emmank",2011-05-01,"it seems like this one deviated the most from the books lots of added scenes but i also think it was my favorite so far it felt as if they spent a little longer focusing on each character and i think i like that approach maybe the scenes themselves were just more meaningful i dont know im not a tv critic but i liked it"
"Seerow",2011-05-01,"i gave it a 9 compared to the 7s i gave the last two episodes this one i felt is the best ive seen so far after the blistering pace of the last couple of episodes it was nice to have an episode where things toned back and we finally got some of the exposition and character development that had been missing for new comers to the show i like how they managed to hit most of the key plot points even if a few characters were changed around and scenes were changed to do it within the bounds of the show basically with this episode i felt like i got everything i would have wanted out of it where the last two definitely felt more rushed to me the one thing that did bug me was we didnt see a confrontation between ned and robert but i guess thats coming edited by seerow 02 may 2011  1200 am"
"Hazl",2011-05-02,"my favorite so far loved the nedjaime robertbarristanjaime cerseijoffrey aryasyrio tyrionyorenbenjen and daenerysviserysjorah scenes loved just about everything the episode furthest removed from the book so far but nothing of the new stuff felt misplaced at all favorite moments tyrion casually pissing off the wall dothraki rider saying you walk and well syrio"
"Daenerys",2011-05-02,"wow still really missing those direwolves but i have to round his one up to a 9 its my favorite episode so far and each has been better than the previous a great trend epi 12 were pretty good but this is the first one that really started feeling epic to me and not rushed it also the first one where i didnt feel cheated like it was too short a fully satisfying hour with a lot of meat to chew on wasnt liking daenerys and the whole dothraki storyline previously but its finally starting to feel important and interesting instead of like a tackedon side plot on a budget dany and jorah were great as was seeing viserys get his neck wrapped with a dothraki whip still have no idea why she was wandering aimlessly in the trees but it was well done firmly showing who now holds the power to viserys littlefinger and varys were pitch perfect and tyrion jaime ned and robert continue to impress i even liked the scene wih cersei and joffrey although i dont know that it was strictly necessary the only minus is sansa granted she hasnt had a chance to show much yet but she feels a bit hollow i still dont like the palm tree exterior of kings landing but the throne room looked better than i expected it to loved the top of the wall and castle black looked exactly how i pictured it a dingy outpost at the edge of the world where the wind and snow whistle through cracked doors and walls and the scene wih arya and syriowow best scene yet in the whole series imo i was blown away by it syrios accent seemed a little odd at first but he was mysterious and funny and just generally awesome and i loved neds reaction at the end no shes not going to be marrying a prince and having babies anytime soon ned if every episode is like this ill be very very happy"
"Arrogant Bastard",2011-05-02,"id rate it at about 710 lots of great individual scenes but as a whole the episode felt kinda cramped i liked most of the new scenes especially tyrions discussion with yoren and benjen and also ser jorah and rakharo however other parts felt a little rushed the whole part with littlefinger cat ned and the dagger i thought moved too quickly and might have benefitted if put later in the episode rather than near the beginning also jon snows attitude changenear the end hes helping grenn adn pypalso seemed to happen too fast i wish they had kept more of the dialogue from donal noye that tyrion usesit felt a little rushed and it didnt seem like jon took any of his words to heart the parts with arya were great both the water dancing and her interaction with ned about needle im glad they mentioned mycah several times in the episode and didnt just disregard his death since it happened in teh last episode so overall it was solid with a lot of great scenes but kind of disjointed in areas i do think this episode will probably be confusing for nonreaders with all the backstory introduced"
"John (Snow) Doe",2011-05-02,"4 this episode was an actionless onslaught of twoperson extended dialogue scenes although a lot of important plot points were advanced and characters introduced there wasnt a lot of creativity with the directing or anything to keep you engaged beyond the topic at hand i respect that theyre trying to stay close to the book but a smart directorproducer would have the characters actually doing something whilst conversing the highlight was the syrio scene it was a great scene because he and arya were doing something besides talking to one another this episode gives a lot of ammunition to critics who pan that the show is just an unfolding of superfluous exposition after how awesome last weeks episode was i can say i was honestly disappointed with this episode and felt as close to bored as i have been thus far"
"Renly Baratheon",2011-05-02,"i gave it an 8 with the two previous episodes getting 7s no action yes but oodles of character developmentwe know more of jamie tyrion arya dany and drogo and are now more invested in them that gives things that happen later more emotional impact syrioarya was just awesome and i felt the emotional impact of the parting of ned and cat knowing it was the last time they would see each other"
"reiver",2011-05-02,"best yet imo i may not have liked a lot of the deviations from the book but there were some excellent scenes that were allowed to last longer than previously and even back to back scenes involvng the same character less of the skipping around between stories made the show feel more settled and less like a sugar high kid with a remote"
"Kaitscralt",2011-05-02,"7 despite it being my favorite episode so far it deviates the most from the books but i love the added scenes and left me wondering why little things were not mentioned or clarified mostly peoples names i want nonreaders to love this show so we get more seasons and this episode seemed confusing edited by kaitscralt 02 may 2011  0809 am"
"Tywin",2011-05-02,"implied miniscule light spoilers here watch outgood episode but the scene with viserys was the weak point for me joffreys actor redeemed himself for me in the scene with cersei thoughfor some reason harry lloyd just doesnt cut it for me as viserys i dont see how daenerys could have been terrified of the guy all this time fair enough i as the audience dont have to find him frightening but it seemed like a key moment to really push the whole thing of dany coming into her own fair enough theres the preconversation with mormont to provide a sense of this but in the book it shows that dany pushes viserys away when he shouts at heri think the scene could have been cut better more close ups on viserys face or something and better intonation in lloyds lines  hes meant to be mad but his anger seems laughable as is he seems like a pantomine baddy when he should in my eyes provide more solid basis for audiences to understand what dany has graduated from he was alright in the first episode grantedthe council scene where ned is being told how much money the treasury is in debt iffy lines came out a bit too quickly between ned and littlefinger small issue thoughdany seems to just accept her pregnancy like oh i am pregnant oh well thats life eh and she seems to have gotten friendly with drogo a bit too easily for my likingbran in my mind could have been made to look more sick and frail perhaps some makeup to make him look pale sweaty etc  on the edge of death the lack of dream exposition for the character may weaken his impact in the story in my view  since hes a very mystical character later onrest of the episode was good i think kit is a good fit jon snowbest bitssyrioarya sparring syrios actor is spot on in terms of his mannerisms and way of speaking though in my mind hes a slap headtyrion banter is always good i chuckled when we saw him pissing off the edge of the world6510editi rewatched the scene with viserys in again i think maybe i have been a bit unkind to harry lloyd though i still think it could have been shot better at least after ned choked littlefinger a bit we got littlefingers quiet little retort as he straightened himself upi think some kind of close up on viserys face to show the growing impatience hes being made to suppress would have been appropriate  as a sort of equivalent it would certainly make whats coming have more impact edited by tywin 02 may 2011  0949 am"
"Abaddon",2011-05-02,"i gave it a 6 for comparison i gave 1 an 8 and 2 a 9 might be a little overharsh and i might adjust it upwards one on rewatch but it just didnt do it for me this week i should add i liked the dothraki arc for the first time and i liked the wall despite some nice high points the kings landing stuff just felt disjointed and off although without watching it again i cant really say why"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-02,"i liked that the lowered the pace as that was needed after the high pacing of the first two now they instead focus on letting the characters sink in plus establish the wall and kings landing more character focused and less focused on driving on the plot is very much in line with a lot of passages in the books then again im usually a person who just sighs at people who say nothing happened i liked this as much as the other two but for a bit different reasons"
"KhalHodor",2011-05-02,"i have to vote 4 love the series so far so many great actors in great roles jaime arya ned jon viserys tyrion cersei joffreyrobert and bran are pitchperfect and a joy to watch these people really know their characters im thoroughly impressed enter renly varys and littlefinger what happened these guys are zombies phoning it in all the way whos decision was it to have renly and yoren switch personalities the small council scene was painful to watch i was embarrassed for the actors these three characters add tremendous flavor and interest to the books what a shame they are not given the same treatment in the series a true disappointment i am praying that this is fixedespecially littlefinger kh"
"Greywolf2375",2011-05-02,"i liked it a lot  gave it an 8 i liked that fact that there wasnt action  this was one of the crossroad episodes that gets everyone in place and creates the foundation of what is to happen my biggest complaint to this point has been the inconsistent iding of people in various scenes"
"TheEvilKing",2011-05-02,"loved it from start to finish best episode yet by a mile 10"

"Songlian",2011-05-02,"sticking with 7 for this one as well i thought it was a mixture of great scenes and not so great scenes i generally tend to agree with what ran wrote in his analysis"
"Fantasma",2011-05-02,"to me it was clearly the best of the season so far great acting by some of the most important characters im gonna give it 910"
"Davieboy",2011-05-02,"i vote 7 wasnt totally happy with the first few minutes did not think the introduction to the council worked well no sense of renlys character for a start littlefinger had chances to shine later didnt much care for the cerseijoffrey scene but jaime is spoton for me liked all the talk of the old king and his crazy doings and the mention of ser simon toyne was a real bonus thought the goodbye scene between cat  ned worked well very poignant arya is just a total delight for me as are jon tyrion robert sir barristan benjen joren the dothraki scenes worked well in this ep  less time on screen but quality time slightly disappointed by the old bear was this raven around but he hasnt had much time yet jorah is flying the family flag higher for now syrio  perfecto and jons ascent of the wall was pretty epic of course every ep gets a 10 by any other standard but so far its 997 difficult to drag myself back into reality at the end of the episode why cant it just keep going"
"Maltaran",2011-05-02,"i gave it a 9 but there seemed to me to be a lot of stuff which would fly over the heads of nonreaders  i could watch it and say yes its that bit and oh we saw that scene in jaimes memory in sos and they mentioned dunk but nonreaders could well be confused"
"Kalbear",2011-05-02,"i gave it a 7 while i dearly loved aryas scenes  and there were some of her very best  the show itself felt really disjointed and oddly edited to the point where it distracted me why is dany getting off a horse why is robert sitting in some random room talking to kingsguard and just hanging out we need to spend a minute looking at jon walk through the castle black to get toan elevator so much exposition not enough dialogue i liked what they were trying to do  the warstory as exposition and backstory is really awesome in that it captures the feel keeps the budget down and gives us the always good unreliable narrator but in this case it felt so out of place why are we just hanging out with selmy and jaime why is robert even in this room guh so many good things  arya arya arya cersei and joff jaimes war jaime and ned and neds brilliant summation of jaime serving when service was safe but a lot was just so oddly blocked that it didnt hit as well as the prior ep did"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-02,"i liked what they were trying to do  the warstory as exposition and backstory is really awesome in that it captures the feel keeps the budget down and gives us the always good unreliable narrator but in this case it felt so out of place why are we just hanging out with selmy and jaime why is robert even in this room guhwhats odd with him being in his bedchamber seems like the most natural place to get away from everything save leaving the castle short way to the bed when youve gotten too drunk as well"

"Hyper",2011-05-02,"my take the weakest episode so far but i still liked it mostly setup and character introductions i wish they would have cut out the long robertser barristanjamie scene and spent the time elsewheremy ratings so farwinter is coming  8the kingsroad  9lord snow  7 edited by hyper 02 may 2011  0638 pm"

"Whitering",2011-05-03,"i voted 8 and it had nearly all to do with arya and tyrion the actors are fantastic i am a big sean bean fan and the small council guys all seem well suited the their roles varys is just the right amount of oily heh there is a show i watch called make it or break it i tivo every episode and skip large parts of it this hour long show becomes a 15 minute episode the way i watch it i filter out all the characters i dont like and all the teenage angsty crap i noticed i skipped right over all the dany stuff this episode i certainly dont do that when i read all in all pretty good i hope to see more of arya over the coming episodes edit an oh ya i agree about old nan her 20 seconds there made the white walkers way more foreboding and scary in way less time than the intro to episode 1 did in a much longer time edited by whitering 03 may 2011  0210 am"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-03,"my take the weakest episode so far but i still liked it mostly setup and character introductions i wish they would have cut out the long robertser barristanjamie scene and spent the time elsewherethis reminds me of how james hibberds episode 3 recap on ew starts the author says he liked this the least of the 6 episodes he saw and his friend thats watching on tv said it was his favorite this far both gave the same argument why theres tons of character developmentim the kind of person his friend is and i thought the scene you wanted to take out was one of the best scenes this far all categories i think the strengths of the book series do not lie with the plot although its fantastic but rather with the characters and scenes like that are what brings the show closer to what the book can do in that regard i my opinion of coursejust fun to see how greatly opinions can differ while still liking it smilegif classbbcemoticon alt "
"kuroishi",2011-05-03,"im firmly on the best episode yet side of the discussion smilegif classbbcemoticon alt  i liked that they spent more time with a few characters in order to flesh them out and let some others a bit on the side if they continue in this direction fleshing out different characters in each episode i could see it working very well as a series"
"Horus Ex Machina",2011-05-03,"easily my favorite episode of the season i felt like we were finally finished being introduced to the characters and finally beginning each of the character arcs i had alot of fun watching this one"

"valacirca",2011-05-03,"i gave this a 6 after giving the first episode an 8 and the second episode a 9 so suffice to say im not a fan of this one i felt that they took a few too many liberties with the story compared to the book that the differences felt jarring as opposed to the subtle way it was handled in the first two episodes i was especially not that keen on how they rearranged catneds arrival at kings landing and how they met and everything related to that lots of iffy changes with the events at the wall as well tyrion had quite some good lines and moments in the part of the book that this episode covered but i didnt feel like he shined in the same way here also i was extremely disappointed with the portrayal of littlefinger which felt incredibly flat and not remotely as colorful and witty as i imagined him to be loved all of the scenes with arya and that scene with robert was superb as well and that oh shit my baby girl is going to battle look that ned had at the end of the episode after he started amused that was perfect"
"Eponine",2011-05-03,"4 i did the opposite of the hardcore fan of the books for whom the show will never be good enough because it wont be exactly like the books all the enjoyment that i got out of this episode is because of the books  i cant resist the chance to see scenes reenacted some of them quite well however as a tv show i feel that its way below hbos best work and if i wasnt a fan of the books and the board but were coming to the show unfamiliar with the story after this episode id be thinking this really isnt for me"
"Kalbear",2011-05-03,"whats odd with him being in his bedchamber seems like the most natural place to get away from everything save leaving the castle short way to the bed when youve gotten too drunk as wellwas that his bedchamber i had no idea it just seemed odd i dont know why roberts there i dont know why anyone else is there why is he just hanging out etc they did that a couple times this ep  with dany getting off her horse because in the next scene she needs to be in an open area and with robert hanging out in a room because he needs to be talking to just his kgit struck me as odd and i noticed it  and that is probably the worst crime being noticed"
"thistlepong",2011-05-03,"im relatively new to both the books and the forum this episode diverged from the source material more than the previous two but i think the changes were effective and acceptable my wife who has no experience with the story really liked this one where she struggled with 01 and 02 i found it entertaining enough to warrant an 8"

"Ser Warpechowski",2011-05-03,"easily my favorite episode of the season i felt like we were finally finished being introduced to the characters and finally beginning each of the character arcs i had alot of fun watching this oneagreed i think this was the best at least now they spent more than a few seconds at each scene where in the previous episodes everything was too rushed now they took some time to develop the characters spend some time on quality dialogue and there were some very good scenes specially old nanâs scene imho the best scene of the episode and syrio forel it was a character development episode and those are my favoritesi mean just look how much time they spent on the scene the assassin tries to kill bran there should be more tension and more time developed to it in episode 3 they gave some scenes its proper time like tyrion talk with mormont old nan ned talking with arya king robert scenethe aditional scenes dont bother me as much for example in the books we get to know much about robert through nedâs memories yet they arent in the show an aditional scene to show him how bad ass he wasis looks proper to mei just wished they had added a flashback scene to the end where ned looks arya and starts to hear battle sounds just wish he could remember something awesome"
"Sancho",2011-05-03,"i have to disagree with most posters in that i am beginning to fear that the show is being bungled as much as i love george rr martins books at this point it is not even close to truly great tv like madmen and breaking bad this episode once again felt like a montage of short scenes depicting important moments and overloaded with expository dialogue character development consists of discrete snapshot scenes where a character suddenly changes from one scene to the next for example in one scene jon snow beats up on the other watch recruits and is generally hated in the next tyrion lectures jon and in the following one jon is already giving pointers to the other recruits its even worse for danny whos relationship with drogo and the dothraki evolves in a choppy and unnatural manner the reason for this is that we are not given any breather scenes to immerse us into the lives of the characters we are told that characters evolve and are even given a reason as to why and how but it just doesnt feel right we simply have no time to let it sink in on top of it the editing in this episode was atrocious as the story jumped from place to place every few minutes if at least we could spend a consecutive twenty minutes with jon or with dany or with cat we might have more time to empathize with them these have been problems in large parts of earlier episodes as well but i kept hoping that once the initial character introductions were done with the show would settle into a better narrative pace with this third episode i am starting to fear that the shows writers and directors are just not able to handle the huge numbers of characters and locations that the story needs to keep track of the frustrating part is that some scenes were truly impressive and demonstrated the potential for greatness that this show could achieve but i fear that maybe 10 episodes per book is simply not enough in order for the viewer to care about the various plot twists heshe must first care for the characters and i am not sure that a nonfan of the book will at this point that being said i continue to look forward to seeing a great story play out on screen and am crossing my fingers that things will fall into place i would hate to see the show canceled after the second season conclusion 510 for this weeks entry"
"Mistral",2011-05-03,"i gave this one a 9 and it is definitely my favourite so far very interesting how it seems to be polarising folk i found this one a delight from start to finish it felt meaty and flavoursome and done in a way that the first two werent they seemed choppy and a little awkward to me  lots of nice ingredients thrown into a pot of water but not yet cooked enough to eat in episode 3 the stew has thickened and the flavours are starting to mingle and it is clear now that this is going to be delicious end of dodgy metaphor leavinggif classbbcemoticon altleaving  all of the actors seemed more comfortable in their roles i thought tyrion was pitchperfect where the previous week i found him a little grating and jons previously immobile face hinted at the promise of expressions to come cersei is really growing on me ned and arya went from great to amazing  i could really feel how out of place ned was as soon as he arrived in kings landing varys was good and i liked gillens performance as littlefinger standout scenes for me tyrion yoren and benjen jawing away in castle black arya and syrio robertbarristanjaime i loved that scene and why shouldnt the king be sitting having a drink and a yak and a good old reminisce so yeah loved it i really feel the series hit its stride with this episode and i feel a lot more confident now in looking forward to the rest of it"
"Eponine",2011-05-03,"character development consists of discrete snapshot scenes where a character suddenly changes from one scene to the next for example in one scene jon snow beats up on the other watch recruits and is generally hated in the next tyrion lectures jon and in the following one jon is already giving pointers to the other recruits this isnt a change or a condensing of the book after donal noye gives jon a similar lecture his entire reaction is suddenly he felt ashamed and guilty then he runs around in happiness that bran will live then he apologizes to grenn in the dining hall and insults alister thorne next chapter all the boys who become his sidekicks have completely forgiven him already and hes become their leader to the point that he can convince them to be nice to sam hes never shown having the slightest bit of difficulty winning any of them over i think that one of the reasons that jon appears to never have to bear the full consequences of anything besides that he doesnt is because hes not very internally reflective its taken for granted that he changed from being a bully to a leader in one moment and then he never reflects on his past actions again"

"arrowfan",2011-05-03,"gave this one a 910 probably more than it deserves but the scenes at the wall and a few others were so cool also the story seems to be settling in for me while the adaptation is clearly the weakest aspect of the hbo series its still pretty good the only scene i did not like in this ep was the conversation between robert and jaime where robert outwardly chastises him it just seemed a bit over the top it does present an interesting angle though ie robert really wasnt a good king and kind of arrogant as well fav scenes  all the stuff at the wall i was worried about the actor for jon as were some others but i have to say hes stealing every scene hes in for me also the odd friendship jon has with tyrion came off well was wondering how they would end this ep the fade out of ned watching arya sword training with syrio was pretty good at first hes bemused and a little proud but then seems to have some misgivings badass award goes to joggo was that him for neckwhiplassoing viserys overall great stuff edited by arrowfan 03 may 2011  0523 pm"

"The Anti-Targ",2011-05-03,"7 from me good bits and bad bits imo with the good outweighing the bad seeing syrio was great and the interplay with arya wonderful didnt much like how things went across the narrow sea i liked what they did at the wall given the constraints though i thought some of the scripting could have been done better and not having steamy breath on the wall when they did it well for the prologue was disappointing i thought all the scenes with ned sansa and arya worked well was less impressed with littlefingers characterisation than i thought id be but could be having too high expectations in the first place renly might as well not have ben at the small council i like varys so far didnt really dig the bob selmy jaime scene i did like the ned jaime scene in the throne room so yeah too many negatives to give an 8 but a solid show nonetheless"

"Sancho",2011-05-04,"first of all theres no sense comparing tv shows written for tv with tv shows adapted from a book the latter will always be at a disadvantageit is true that adapting a book into tv is usually more challenging than writing a new series from scratch as you have to modify it in such a way as to make it work visually in a serial of limited duration while still retaining the spirit and narrative of the original work which was itself not written with such an adaptation in mind however the average viewer will not care about whether a series is adapted from a book or not in the end a tv series must stand on its own apart from the original work and by that measure and as much as i personally enjoy watching it so far hbos game of thrones does not match up to other great contemporary shows"

"Lady Blackfish",2011-05-04,"imo this was the weakest of the three episodes so far and i dont buy the idea being shilled around that people who didnt like it prefer action to character development i love character development more than chocolate and as for action asos is my least favorite book of the series while i adore affc flaws and all it was just way too choppy i agree with sancho theres a notable difference in quality between this show and something like mad men at least if episode three is to be taken as an example its good dont get me wrong there are watchable actors and fun lines and nice scenery and of course a very interesting plot but i think the show could achieve so much more if they just tried to apply more thematic cohesion to each episode unit this show is fun and involving but it has the potential to be much better than it is given the source material another thing i agree with sancho on the dialog is so expository and i think its beginning to lose its justification i think with a more artistic bent the show could be confident in communicating more with less when i watch a show like mad men i delight in being able to observe things for myself and i love that matt weiner gives me credit for the intelligence to figure things out while watching this episode it struck me what a lack of subtlety there is which diminishes my perception of richness i thought a number of the actors were a bit awkward aiden gillen and michelle fairley in particular there were some changes i couldnt really discern the purpose behind like renlys seeming friendship with ned joffreys entire characterization in the episode etc i gave this episode a 6 and probably wouldve rated it lower if not for the fact that i really want to love this show with all my fanatical being and that i enjoyed two scenes near the end a whole lot benjen yoren and tyrion and then aryas training with syrio forel all three episodes so far have had good endings imo i just wish the rest of the episode didnt feel like this happened and then this and then this until it was time to end it edited by lady blackfish 04 may 2011  0435 pm"

"The Anti-Targ",2011-05-04,"right at the end his sword breaks thats when arya runs awaydont get me wrong i dont think hes alive but theres no doubt we are all assuming hes dead because his death has never been confirmed and as we know even people who die on screen occasionally come back in this story so theres no way you can be certain of an off screen deathits also possible that syrio turns up in aryas story and rescues her from becomming a faceless woman turning her into an honourable swordswoman in the image of the braavosi first sword people are worried aryas becoming a little sociopath so syrio pulling her back from that fate is a legitimate and reasonable comeback for the presumed dead swordmaster"

"The King's Foot",2011-05-04,"my quickhit thoughts on the episode  sean bean is killing it as ned especially in this episode the scene with jamie in the throne roomsean bean made ned look super dangerous there bringing some of that irish terrorist from patriot games into the eyes jamie lannister you may be younger a knight and a member of the elite kingsguard but ned starks about to throw down and if looks could kill  add also the final look he gives catelyn as she rides out of kl  if youre like me and watching this with a spouse  sig other who has not read the series how hard was it not to blurt out that this is the last time they see each other alive  the doll for sansa was it just me or did anyone else hear ned say here this is from your joff when he handed it to her ive read posts in this and the other thread saying how this scene and the subsequent scenes with arya show how ned doesnt get sansa but does arya bc he gave sansa such a childish gift i was pretty sure watching this that the gift was from joffrey and since it followed the scene where cersei advises joff to do something nice for her that made sense from her reaction you can gleam that at least in the tv series sansa is pissed at joff about lady i think the writers are trying to keep viewers from despising sansa by ahaving ned tell arya why it was necessary for sansa to stand by her manboy and bshowing sansa as sullen and angry towards joff due to lady so when joff lays it on thick for her during the hands tourney well see her fall back in love with him  was anyone else annoyed that the uniqueness of jamies golden armor is not being represented we see jamie in the gold armor earlier and i was thinking cool theres the famous golden armor of jamie lannister then we see selmy wearing the same thing and realize this is tvs version of the kingsguard armor bummer  how badassjason bourneinblack was jon snow in this episode he needs to be built up as a character to survive some serious fighting later on and i think the tv writers are actually doing a better job showing how good a fighter he is than grrm did overall this episode felt the most divergent in terms of the  of scenes not in the actual book roberts drunken war stories jamiened in the throne room cerseijoff etceven ned watching arya train was not in the books however i still really enjoyed it and frankly this episode helped me come to terms with how much the writers will have to deviate simply put there is too much plot and character development that happens inside characters inner monologues  the writers have to create scenes out of thin air that will help them get their points across on what makes each character tick without resorting to some ghastly narrator"

"MountainThatRides",2011-05-05,"boy oh boy its so difficult to gauge my reaction to this show its so difficult to tell whether as a reader and fan for many years my expectations are too high or if the show is doing the book a disservice with its additions and omissions i believe its the former and attribute most of my trepidation to the simple fact that this story plays out so vividly and specifically in my head when im reading the books and seeing it come to life is going to be disappointing in some way so many pagetoscreen adaptations suffer from this people who have never read the books can embrace the show for what it is and be drawn in while for those whove read the series its difficult to put the nitpicking aside entirelyas for the episode i can see how nonreaders would think its the best yet as readers i believe that we at least partially judge the quality of an episode by its fidelity to the source material and how many direct scenesbits of dialogue make the jump to the screen i know i do episode 2 was i thought very promising in how much of the book it gave us there were a lot of little dialogue bits where i knew what was coming and i could say the lines as the characters were saying them in episode 3 we got less of this but the syrio scene went a long way toward making up for itthings with which i took issuethe lack of direwolves i suppose though im not so outraged about it as some people seem to be i understand working with animals is a fickle endeavor but their amount of screen time compared to their relevance to the story seems unfair if it wasnt so expensive i might not have minded a liveactioncgi mix for the wolves to at least suggest their presence in the postproduction of certain scenesthe cerseijoffrey scene i didnt like anything about it the advice cersei gave to joffrey was okay at some points but at others it was way uncharacteristic itd be more believable for cersei to suggest he fuck myrcella or even cersei herself than painted whores also it put a great deal of emphasis on some northernsouthern schism which is only a small cultural dichotomy in the book the realm isnt really divided into northerners and southerners not in that sense the men of the north may view their southern counterparts with condescension and vice versa but its the seven kingdoms not the american civil war the standing army notion was also kind of ridiculous though the way cersei shot it down was somewhat redeemingthe daenerysviserys scene where she wandered off randomly and he rushed in after her just as randomly what the fuck it would have taken 30 seconds to establish that scene more believablythe lone wolf speech of all the dialogue that made the transition from book to screen i was counting on this one it has such clear imagery and relevance to the plot not to mention helps to establish neds philosophy on family it makes no sense that they wouldnt use itthings i enjoyedthe war stories scene they could have introduced barristan selmy better and it kind of made robert look like a dick but it helped to establish his faded glory mentality and the nostalgia he cant escape they worked in mentions of tarly so in the next episode when sam is introduced there will be a point of reference plus summerhall the kingswood brotherhood simon toyne etc also robert making fun of lancel was fantastic foreshadowed the wineskin warrior and helped to establish how robert sees the lannisters ie a nest of vipersjorah and rakharo comparing their weapons the steel dress reference and the dothrakis disdain for the westerosi fighting style is important and the fact that despite their views the dothraki in the khalasar clearly consider jorah to be an accomplished warrior which seems accurate to me arya and syrio such a fan service so delicious syrio didnt look like i imagined him but that scene was satisfying as fuck the dialogue was spoton the men are made of water pierce them the water leaks out and they die line made me smile like an idiotall the other changes didnt make an impact on me one way or another most were necessary for pacingcasting reasons the wall is actually quite a large chunk of the first book and they had to condense it down to fit with the linear storytelling donal noye getting the axe was unsurprising though i hope hell make an appearance later on i also hope thorne is fleshed out more as a character though at this point a bond has already formed between john pyp and grenn so the need for ser alliser as a common enemy is dwindling the introduction of sam along with rast and his croneys might call for thorne to show his true colors and really establish the brotherhood between john sam pyp grenn etcoverall i thought it was a good episode a bit fast in the pacing but the show is certainly becoming progressively more engrossing even some of my favorite shows didnt hook me right off the bat well rome did but deadwood and firefly took maybe 23 episodes for me to be completely committed the major problem being the high expectations as a reader and having to constantly force myself to take the show for what it is and not grade it in comparison to the books most of the casting decisions are good thankfully though catelyn should be sexier not a sexpot like cersei but she is a sexual being in a very matronly medieval milf sort of way like in the book when shes all naked and doesnt give a shit if maester luwin sees her red tully bush because shes got a mystery to solve yeeaaah best casting so far ned robert old nan tyrion and arya varys is pretty spot on toomost dubious casting so far renly and littlefinger will have to grow on me also i like the hound but i think he should have a bit more fire in his belly a bit more wrath and bitterness hes just kind of dour and hohum oh yeah he ran just you know not very fast whatever fuck off stark im all disinterested and shit with my weird hairedit quoted from lothbroki loved the episode except kl seems to tropical to me

"The_Halfhand",2011-05-02,"1 changed neds arrival at kings landing in the book when ned is immediately summoned to the small council he refuses because hes just had a long journey but quickly decides not to shun the other council members upon his arrival in the show he goes immidiately without bickering in the book he chooses to change his clothes quickly to look presentable in the show when the steward recommends he make himself look presentable ned gives him the evil eye whats up with that 2 added jamie meets ned in the throne room in the book ned goes straight to the room of the small council where were first introduced to littlefinger varys and grand maester pycel in the show he first goes to the throne room where jamie lannister is waiting for him 3 changed the king eats and the hand takes the shit in the book there is a saying what the king dreams the hand builds but robert communicates the more common phrase the king eats and the hand takes the shit to ned but in the show it has been changed to the less poetic the king shits and the hand wipes yet another odd change of dialogue for no apparent reason 4 added jamies account of the deaths of neds brother and father i believe this was internal monologue from storm of swords with jamie remembering how neds brother and father were killed by king aerys but they fit it into the scene with ned and jamie 5 changed no barriston selmy the first meeting with the small council is largely unchanged from the book but even though we meet renly we have yet to meet ser barriston selmy lord commander of the kingsguard 6 added cercei tending joffreys wounds seeing cercei attend joffreys wounds and joffrey showing his insecurities and unwillingness to marry sansa quite a different joffrey from the one in the books also cercei suggesting joffrey fuck whores is entirely out of character for her and cerceis advice to joffrey about his conquest of the north was far too shrewd for her 7 changed sansa and arya eating in the book this scene happens much later after the arrival in kings landing and definitely after ned meets with catelyn in the book its a dinner scene in the small hall and the hands tourney is discussed in the book after ned leaves arya runs away angry from septa mordane and runs to her room where ned later finds her and talks to her in the show ned sends her to her room 8 added ned and aryas talk of joffrey this quick exchange about joffrey being a liar was not in the book 9 changed neds talk of survival in the winter no talk of the lone wolf dying while the pack survives kindof important symbolism completely left out of the show 10 left out brans dream of the threeeyed crow old nans reference to the crow is kinda odd since there was no set up of the threeeyed crow 11 changed brans scene with old nan no mention of brandon the builder in this scene and rob does not come to him in the book instead its maester luwin and hodor who take him down to the hall to sit with rob who is meeting with tyrion lannister on his way back from the wall obviously this scene was moved up in the timeline of the tv show and bran sits and talks to rob and talks about losing the use of his legs 12 changed catelyns arrival in kings landing in the book she arrives by sea and gets to kings landing before ned 13 changed catelyns meeting with littlefinger in the book it was the tyroshi merchant moreo who ratted out catelyns arrival to littlefinger in the book shes staying in an inn and is summoned by men of the city watch while ser roderick is away and taken to littlefingers brothel 14 added tyrions scene with commander mormont at the wall in the book tyrion never witnessed ser allisters training of the boys with mormont and mormont never inexplicably gave tyrion the message from winterfell about brans revival 15 changed jons conversation with donal noye in the book the onearmed smith of the nights watch donel noye is the man who points out jons bullying of the recruits in the show they gave these lines to tyrion also in the book its grenns wrist jon injured not his nose and the others were not present during jons lecture 16 added cercei and jamie arguing about bran yet another scene told in flashback in a storm of swords moved up to the tv show 17 added robert talking with ser barriston selmy robert recounts killing a tarly boy as his first kill in battle to ser barristan we also get to meet lancel in this scene and get the story of jamie fighting the kingswood brotherhood yet another bit of info from a storm of swords moved up to game of thrones this scene was not in the book and only serves to make robert seem like a true ass hole 18 changed the dothraki sea in the book danny rides off alone on her horse into the dothraki sea after commanding the khalasar to halt and wait for her in the tv show she dismounts and wanders off for no apparent reason also in the book shes the one who commands viserys to walk back to camp without a horse something that has much more meaning in the book than it did in the show having jhogo make that decision also in the book it was made clear viserys was enraged after mormont told him to stay on the ridge in the tv show it seemed a little odd that viserys would fly off the handle without recieving a direct command 19 changed jons final meeting with benjen stark in the book the meeting happened as benjen was riding out for his ranging not at the top of the wall 20 changed tyrions meeting in the feast hall of castle black we finally get a proper introduction to yoren who seems much less sour than he was in the books and for some reason benjen stark is given all of allister thornes hostility towards tyrion 21 changed the revelation of dannys pregnancy slight change from the books danny is practicing her dothraki when jhiqui tells her shes pregnant in the book danny already knows in the show it takes danny by surprise 22 added mormonts scene with jhogo discussing weapons and armor this was not in the books and in the books jorah never left the khalasar to ride to quohor after discovering danny was pregnant 23 removed jon offering his help to grenn and embarassing thorne though we see jon in the yard helping grenn and pyp we dont see the transformation he goes through in the books heading into the feast hall to offer his help and making fun of ser allister 24 changed tyrions talk with mormont and maester aemon many of mormonts lines were given to maester aemon who comes off more dour and crabby than he does in the books in the books the conversation he has with mormont about the state of the nights watch is done alone at night by a fire here its done with both mormont and maester aemon during the day 25 added danny and drogo in bed the scene where she tells drogo her child will be a boy was not in the book 26 added tyrion pissing off the top of the wall in the book tyrion never actually pissed off the edge of the world however they seemed to feel the need to show that in the tv series also jon did not ask tyrion to help bran as he did in the book and they completely left out the whole friendship affirmation that preceded the final handshake between jon and tyrion 27 changed ned watching arya with syrio forell in the books ned was never present at any of aryas trainings also syrio forell was bald in the book overall i thought the pace of this episode was much to fast and the writers are yet again making strange changes to iconic lines and scenes the best scene in my opinion was arya and syrio since it was the most faithful to the books and worked the best in the show

"reiver",2011-05-02,"pretty full summary of the changes there one that i thought was very weird was the change to the nedrenly dialogue in the council meeting since this is the first time the viewers meet renly the book dialogue or at least the jist of it would make a perfect intro to the character by having ned say that renly is the image of his brother it puts in an important plot point and also establishes who the character is and why hes there it seems strange to leave out this possibility for a rather artful intro i didnt like the two added scenes early on jamiened and cerseijoff im not sure how much this is my inner book geek screaming wrong when they say something that seems out of character or whether the scenes just dont work though the brandon the builder change was a good one imo by changing it to him liking stories about dunk it fits his characters dreams of knighthood brandon the builder always strikes me as more the stories bran would come to prefer i loved this scene old nans voice is perfect most of the changes baffle me as well maybe its that im too used to the books but certainly the changes seem to be driven by a desire to change rather than to clarify whats covered by internal monologue and description which leaves the lines and speeches feeling poorer edited by reiver 02 may 2011  0641 am"
"Kaitscralt",2011-05-02,"18 changed the dothraki seain the book danny rides off alone on her horse into the dothraki sea after commanding the khalasar to halt and wait for her in the tv show she dismounts and wanders off for no apparent reason also in the book shes the one who commands viserys to walk back to camp without a horse something that has much more meaning in the book than it did in the show having jhogo make that decision also in the book it was made clear viserys was enraged after mormont told him to stay on the ridge in the tv show it seemed a little odd that viserys would fly off the handle without recieving a direct commandnone of the changes bothered me except for daenerys not showing her backbone against viserys it was a needless change and the show seems to be trying to make every character sympathetic for some reason it was also poorly shown that viserys had even received a command so his rage was random and not fleshed out well also without eddards pov thoughts the nonreader will be wondering who all these nonnamed important secondary characters areexample council meeting eddard says lord baelish when greeting littlefinger then catelyn calls him petyr to eddard when littlefingers offscreen then eddard calls him littlefinger to cat in the next scene so to a nonreader that could be three different people if they arent very perceptiveeddard and arya talking about the hound without him ever having been named on the show yet who is the hound one of those wolves or something  nonreaderselmy ah whats in a name etc edited by kaitscralt 02 may 2011  0806 am"

"CryFenril",2011-05-02,"i noticed right away that this episode had many many more changes especially in the dialog than the others and i suppose its for pacings sake quite a few important minor characters had to be introduced quickly and there wasnt enough time to flesh them all out so it seems to me there was some recobbling to fit the pace i am okay with tyrion taking noyes lines and even okay with it being done publicly to shame jon a bit  thats a very tyrion way to do it as long as he doesnt take on donals fight with mag the mighty too lol okay with thornes sidelining as well since all he is is a dissenting force for jon to work against jon acknowledges that tyrion was the only one who gave him truth about the wall so that sort of moves along the friendshipbuilding there i do wish we had ghost though even just following jon around the lack is glaring skipping the sea voyage to get cat and rodrick to kl quickly was okay with me and the dialog between catnedpetyr had to be cut down by necessity it would have been almost long enough to take up the episode by itself if itd been kept intact lol glad they at least allowed petyr to reference neds brother and his token of esteem neds unease with courtly life and the tension between himself and the council was well established though quickly and for me it worked reminiscing over wine established a great many things  roberts weakness for wine and lancels awareness and subsequent resentment barristans steadfast service jaimies casual attitude toward killing and his reaction to roberts jab underline the fact that the only thing jaime really takes seriously in his life is cersei sansas rejection of her fathers gift doesnt quite jive with her bookself trying to be gracious and a proper little lady but it does go a long way toward showing her teen angst and the terrible position shes been thrown into further illustrated by ned explaining to arya that sansa cannot betray joffrey another nice addition the added line from arya how could you let her marry someone like that was an unexpected touch  it shows a depth to aryas character that we might miss elsewise it sets up the fact that sometimes children see things that adults might not catch thankfully syrio and arya were left completely intact and i think that was as much a gift from dd to us readers in exchange for all of the changes as it was anything else the scene didnt have to be as long as it was to establish what was happening so i tend to see it as a nod to those of us who memorize stuff like just so and it is known and feel a bump in the road when we dont hear them the look on neds face and the slow change from clacking wooden sounds to clashing steel sounds was incredible  one of the deepest scenes weve seen yet in five seconds with no dialog sean bean is blowing me away with his expressiveness perhaps the most subtle yet still the very best change they have made so far all men are made of water did you know this fencinggif classbbcemoticon altfencing "

"Bronn Stone",2011-05-03,"with all due respect i bloody well do aswell as a fair few readers he takes on a goddamn giant in a tunnel and whacks the best part of jons aristocratic hauteur hes a massive shoutout for disabled readers aswell as being pretty fun to read aboutsoyeahalmost all of which he can do just fine as a character introduced in the third season if they go that way plus you get the bonus of attracting a better actor with a juicy role for a few episodes rather than one youd have to have squeezed in with minor bits in season 1 then only revisited in season 3the cast and crew of this thing are huge watch the credits realize just how many people are involved in this production then add the massive costumes sets and cgi i think it is a remarkable achievement for the relatively small budget of 50mseason"
"Mad Sweeney",2011-05-03,"almost all of which he can do just fine as a character introduced in the third season if they go that way plus you get the bonus of attracting a better actor with a juicy role for a few episodes rather than one youd have to have squeezed in with minor bits in season 1 then only revisited in season 3the cast and crew of this thing are huge watch the credits realize just how many people are involved in this production then add the massive costumes sets and cgi i think it is a remarkable achievement for the relatively small budget of 50mseasonits actually not when you realize that all of their decisions lower the production costs 50milseason for ireland with uk crew and relative nobodies for a majority of the roles is not comparable at all to a 50mil budget in the us with union production and name actors add into the fact that hbo is notoriously cheap taking advantage of their cable status to consistently underpay crew and that budget is probably 30 40 more effective where theyre shooting it then the actual per episode comparison would be about 65 mil per episode thats a lot"
"Solmyr",2011-05-03,"the only addition i liked was robert and his war stories then jaime comes in and robert asked him about aerys last words i already knew where it is going burn them all and the look on roberts face a nice foreshadowing for season3 where well hopefully see jaimes redemption edited by solmyr 03 may 2011  0120 pm"
"SerArthurHeath",2011-05-03,"ymmv obviously because whilst the changes you have stated are all present and true the significance and negativity you seem to universally apply to them doesnt make sense to me1 changed neds arrival at kings landingin the book when ned is immediately summoned to the small council he refuses because hes just had a long journey but quickly decides not to shun the other council members upon his arrival in the show he goes immidiately without bickering in the book he chooses to change his clothes quickly to look presentable in the show when the steward recommends he make himself look presentable ned gives him the evil eye whats up with thatit fits with neds character wariness and mood after his less than pleasant journey and his fears about kl and the fact that given his status someone is telling him what he sees as a practical role cannot wear what he sees as practical and adequate clothing he is neing snubbed and is not happy about it and is being stronger willed than ned of the books at this point which given neds overall character and current circumstances makes more sense agreeing to the instant meeting also makes more sense as ned sees his job as important and practical and needs to get to work he is a professional2 added jamie meets ned in the throne roomin the book ned goes straight to the room of the small council where were first introduced to littlefinger varys and grand maester pycel in the show he first goes to the throne room where jamie lannister is waiting for himi dont like aspects of this scene  jaime in the book would never explain himself to ned nor feel the need to but the exposition of it is vital in this format what is worse is that jaime stabbed aerys in the back and thus changes the reason why the deed was so dishonourable jaime even lampshades this and i hope there is a good reason for this change as it does have an impact on jaimes character id rather just have had a flashback tbh3 changed the king eats and the hand takes the shitin the book there is a saying what the king dreams the hand builds but robert communicates the more common phrase the king eats and the hand takes the shit to ned but in the show it has been changed to the less poetic the king shits and the hand wipes yet another odd change of dialogue for no apparent reasoni prefer this version it makes more sense and the vulgarity is kind of the point4 added jamies account of the deaths of neds brother and fatheri believe this was internal monologue from storm of swords with jamie remembering how neds brother and father were killed by king aerys but they fit it into the scene with ned and jamiethis is annoying i agree its exposition id rather they saved i understand its to make tension between ned and jaime but im not sure any more tension is needed5 changed no barriston selmythe first meeting with the small council is largely unchanged from the book but even though we meet renly we have yet to meet ser barriston selmy lord commander of the kingsguardthey dont want to add to many characters too early in the episode id have preferred him to be there but i dont think it would have worked6 added cercei tending joffreys woundsseeing cercei attend joffreys wounds and joffrey showing his insecurities and unwillingness to marry sansa quite a different joffrey from the one in the books also cercei suggesting joffrey fuck whores is entirely out of character for her and cerceis advice to joffrey about his conquest of the north was far too shrewd for hera in what way is her advice shrewd coolgif classbbcemoticon altb  its based on her own experiences with robert and helps actually portray the reason for cersei hating robert which is a vital aspect of her characterc in got cersei is shrewd  she is the main villain at this point and doesnt suffer from villain decay until later as other posters have pointed out7 changed sansa and arya eatingin the book this scene happens much later after the arrival in kings landing and definitely after ned meets with catelyn in the book its a dinner scene in the small hall and the hands tourney is discussed in the book after ned leaves arya runs away angry from septa mordane and runs to her room where ned later finds her and talks to her in the show ned sends her to her roomthis change is irrelevant and barely counts  it still fits with the overall timeline and with all the characters personalities8 added ned and aryas talk of joffreythis quick exchange about joffrey being a liar was not in the bookbut acts to remind the audience and to cement ned and aryas relationship9 changed neds talk of survival in the winterno talk of the lone wolf dying while the pack survives kindof important symbolism completely left out of the showi agree10 left out brans dream of the threeeyed crowold nans reference to the crow is kinda odd since there was no set up of the threeeyed crowthis is odd but i expect to see a deleted scene in the dvd11 changed brans scene with old nanno mention of brandon the builder in this scene and rob does not come to him in the book instead its maester luwin and hodor who take him down to the hall to sit with rob who is meeting with tyrion lannister on his way back from the wall obviously this scene was moved up in the timeline of the tv show and bran sits and talks to rob and talks about losing the use of his legs12 changed catelyns arrival in kings landingin the book she arrives by sea and gets to kings landing before ned13 changed catelyns meeting with littlefingerin the book it was the tyroshi merchant moreo who ratted out catelyns arrival to littlefinger in the book shes staying in an inn and is summoned by men of the city watch while ser roderick is away and taken to littlefingers brothel14 added tyrions scene with commander mormont at the wallin the book tyrion never witnessed ser allisters training of the boys with mormont and mormont never inexplicably gave tyrion the message from winterfell about brans revival15 changed jons conversation with donal noyein the book the onearmed smith of the nights watch donel noye is the man who points out jons bullying of the recruits in the show they gave these lines to tyrion also in the book its grenns wrist jon injured not his nose and the others were not present during jons lecturei think this works better16 added cercei and jamie arguing about branyet another scene told in flashback in a storm of swords moved up to the tv show17 added robert talking with ser barriston selmyrobert recounts killing a tarly boy as his first kill in battle to ser barristan we also get to meet lancel in this scene and get the story of jamie fighting the kingswood brotherhood yet another bit of info from a storm of swords moved up to game of thrones this scene was not in the book and only serves to make robert seem like a true ass holei think it shows how roberts kingdom has worn him down plus robert is a bit of an asshole18 changed the dothraki seain the book danny rides off alone on her horse into the dothraki sea after commanding the khalasar to halt and wait for her in the tv show she dismounts and wanders off for no apparent reason also in the book shes the one who commands viserys to walk back to camp without a horse something that has much more meaning in the book than it did in the show having jhogo make that decision also in the book it was made clear viserys was enraged after mormont told him to stay on the ridge in the tv show it seemed a little odd that viserys would fly off the handle without recieving a direct command19 changed jons final meeting with benjen starkin the book the meeting happened as benjen was riding out for his ranging not at the top of the wall20 changed tyrions meeting in the feast hall of castle blackwe finally get a proper introduction to yoren who seems much less sour than he was in the books and for some reason benjen stark is given all of allister thornes hostility towards tyrion21 changed the revelation of dannys pregnancyslight change from the books danny is practicing her dothraki when jhiqui tells her shes pregnant in the book danny already knows in the show it takes danny by surprise22 added mormonts scene with jhogo discussing weapons and armorthis was not in the books and in the books jorah never left the khalasar to ride to quohor after discovering danny was pregnant but it does help lead the audience to understand jorah is dodgy23 removed jon offering his help to grenn and embarassing thornethough we see jon in the yard helping grenn and pyp we dont see the transformation he goes through in the books heading into the feast hall to offer his help and making fun of ser allister24 changed tyrions talk with mormont and maester aemonmany of mormonts lines were given to maester aemon who comes off more dour and crabby than he does in the books in the books the conversation he has with mormont about the state of the nights watch is done alone at night by a fire here its done with both mormont and maester aemon during the day25 added danny and drogo in bedthe scene where she tells drogo her child will be a boy was not in the book26 added tyrion pissing off the top of the wallin the book tyrion never actually pissed off the edge of the world however they seemed to feel the need to show that in the tv series also jon did not ask tyrion to help bran as he did in the book and they completely left out the whole friendship affirmation that preceded the final handshake between jon and tyrion27 changed ned watching arya with syrio forellin the books ned was never present at any of aryas trainings also syrio forell was bald in the bookoverall i thought the pace of this episode was much to fast and the writers are yet again making strange changes to iconic lines and scenes the best scene in my opinion was arya and syrio since it was the most faithful to the books and worked the best in the show honestly many of these changes are just unnecessary makes me wonder why the producers are doing these changessome of them are useful because you have to introduce characters more slowly and information more blatantly on a tv showalso no ghost again what is up with that and come to think of it no sight of mormonts crow either meh ghosts time will come"
"Guest_Raids_*",2011-05-04,"believe it or not we can already read the whole opin the op the lack of ghost sucks for me also and the danyviserys scene did she have to pee where was she going why does she just go back"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-04,"believe it or not we can already read the whole opin the opthe lack of ghost sucks for me also and the danyviserys scene did she have to pee where was she going why does she just go backhes written his responses to each point in the op within the quoteas for dany i thought it was quite clear how they were talking about how the dothraki get and keep their slaves and how she stopped after a slave was being beaten dany can sympathize with them as shes practically been a slave to viserys and to me it seemed like she needed to get away from that for a while you can see her taking a relaxed sigh when she comes to the clearing before viserys storms in"
"SerArthurHeath",2011-05-04,"believe it or not we can already read the whole opin the opthe lack of ghost sucks for me also and the danyviserys scene did she have to pee where was she going why does she just go backsorry i wrote my response on my phone and did not realise that would happen as has been noted ive posted individual responses within the quote marks but missed out some of the middle ones because it was taking too long and i was worried id sign out automatically and have to start again"
"Tobin",2011-05-05,"i miss mormonts crow  i keep looking for him and ghost more than i would have expected the cut of the 3eyed crow bothers me too  thats a setup for the warg revelation much later"

"Snow White",2011-05-05,"mormonts bird wasnt doing complete sentences but i thought the 3eyed crow didyou are correct ive already written off getting a first person look at the three eyed crow although they may still flash back to iti think mormonts crow is the more likely candidate for screen time at this point"

"Maester Cressan",2011-05-06,"boy so many complaints about it not being the exact same i have only two complaints and only one of which i think was a real error1 changed neds arrival at kings landingin the book when ned is immediately summoned to the small council he refuses because hes just had a long journey but quickly decides not to shun the other council members upon his arrival in the show he goes immidiately without bickering in the book he chooses to change his clothes quickly to look presentable in the show when the steward recommends he make himself look presentable ned gives him the evil eye whats up with thatthe book version is too complicated to show on film while the nuances are great for a book in revealing neds character it wouldnt do for tv they simplified it in a way that emphasizes neds character as dutiful and provincial hes not into dressing up and he doesnt put off unpleasant duties this is an accurate portrayal of neds character so i see no reason to be upset over such a trivial change that works much better on tv then the original would2 added jamie meets ned in the throne roomin the book ned goes straight to the room of the small council where were first introduced to littlefinger varys and grand maester pycel in the show he first goes to the throne room where jamie lannister is waiting for him3 changed the king eats and the hand takes the shitin the book there is a saying what the king dreams the hand builds but robert communicates the more common phrase the king eats and the hand takes the shit to ned but in the show it has been changed to the less poetic the king shits and the hand wipes yet another odd change of dialogue for no apparent reason4 added jamies account of the deaths of neds brother and fatheri believe this was internal monologue from storm of swords with jamie remembering how neds brother and father were killed by king aerys but they fit it into the scene with ned and jamiewe needed a backstory that still had not been filled out now we know that jaime killed the mad king and now we know why ned rebelled against the former king even though hes all mr duty also it helps us understand jaime a bit better and earns him some fans for at least being the one to kill the mad king5 changed no barriston selmythe first meeting with the small council is largely unchanged from the book but even though we meet renly we have yet to meet ser barriston selmy lord commander of the kingsguardthe scene introduced varys littlefinger and renly way too many characters already no point in mentioning or showing the head of the kingsguard when he can be shown later and selmy has the excuse of guarding the king to explain his absence6 added cercei tending joffreys woundsseeing cercei attend joffreys wounds and joffrey showing his insecurities and unwillingness to marry sansa quite a different joffrey from the one in the books also cercei suggesting joffrey fuck whores is entirely out of character for her and cerceis advice to joffrey about his conquest of the north was far too shrewd for herit wasnt a bad scene cersei isnt a complete moron you know she does have a certain level of cunning enough to know that joffreys plan was idiocy notice that her proposed replacement solution has its own kind of idiocy marry sansa and show kindness to her sometimes but still consider her an enemy thats classic cersei i agree the painted whores comment was a bit out of character from how i understood her but i suppose it might coincide with cerseis general impression of how men behave and maybe cersei wasnt just giving straight advice but was also manipulating joffrey that actually would fit with cerseis character i think and be kind of sad i think i like the direction they are taking this cersei shes a little different from the books but not too much different7 changed sansa and arya eatingin the book this scene happens much later after the arrival in kings landing and definitely after ned meets with catelyn in the book its a dinner scene in the small hall and the hands tourney is discussed in the book after ned leaves arya runs away angry from septa mordane and runs to her room where ned later finds her and talks to her in the show ned sends her to her room8 added ned and aryas talk of joffreythis quick exchange about joffrey being a liar was not in the bookunimportant changes that help improve the flow on screen and communicate the same information in less time9 changed neds talk of survival in the winterno talk of the lone wolf dying while the pack survives kindof important symbolism completely left out of the showhuh ned may not have used the symbolism but he did explicitly teach this to arya strange that you missed the biggest change and i think the real mistake this episodeno mention of lyanna i think that would have been a big improvement for little cost add this dialoguened wistfully you remind me of my sisterarya surprised aunt lyanna was beautifulned sadly she was beautiful and wild and dead before her timeslip it in right before ned leaves and tells arya that if she has a sword she should know how to use it it would have added to the audiences knowledge about neds sister that she was like arya it would hint that one of the reasons ned is letting arya learn sword work is because he fears what happened to his sister could happen to her it would have made the ending scene that must stronger shades of promise me ned10 left out brans dream of the threeeyed crowold nans reference to the crow is kinda odd since there was no set up of the threeeyed crow11 changed brans scene with old nanno mention of brandon the builder in this scene and rob does not come to him in the book instead its maester luwin and hodor who take him down to the hall to sit with rob who is meeting with tyrion lannister on his way back from the wall obviously this scene was moved up in the timeline of the tv show and bran sits and talks to rob and talks about losing the use of his legsit would have been hard to do the dream its okay to leave it out at this point we dont need to know that stuff until later the flow works better as this is a way to keep bran and rob in this episode instead of disappearing also i loved the duncan the tall reference12 changed catelyns arrival in kings landingin the book she arrives by sea and gets to kings landing before ned13 changed catelyns meeting with littlefingerin the book it was the tyroshi merchant moreo who ratted out catelyns arrival to littlefinger in the book shes staying in an inn and is summoned by men of the city watch while ser roderick is away and taken to littlefingers brothelcomplications that are interesting world building in the book are too much for the tv keep it simple they wasted time on naked breasts though that should have been spent comparing arya to lyanna14 added tyrions scene with commander mormont at the wallin the book tyrion never witnessed ser allisters training of the boys with mormont and mormont never inexplicably gave tyrion the message from winterfell about brans revival15 changed jons conversation with donal noyein the book the onearmed smith of the nights watch donel noye is the man who points out jons bullying of the recruits in the show they gave these lines to tyrion also in the book its grenns wrist jon injured not his nose and the others were not present during jons lecturetoo many characters noyles lines were best given to tyrion for the condensed tv version they can introduce noyle later16 added cercei and jamie arguing about branyet another scene told in flashback in a storm of swords moved up to the tv showgood addition its the main plot point people want to know about at this point let them see the creepy love affair of the lannister twins17 added robert talking with ser barriston selmyrobert recounts killing a tarly boy as his first kill in battle to ser barristan we also get to meet lancel in this scene and get the story of jamie fighting the kingswood brotherhood yet another bit of info from a storm of swords moved up to game of thrones this scene was not in the book and only serves to make robert seem like a true ass holethis was probably the best addition of the whole show so far robert didnt come across as an asshole to me more of an earthy earnest warrior who hates being king and prefers thinking about the glory days but not in the hazy everything was good in the old days way but a more realistic and gritty memory it painted roberts character wellit also introduced briefly ser barristan and gave us an idea of his character it let us know that the lannisters are an ambitious family that have surrounded the king and introduced lancel and his main role in the story it also increased our understanding of jaimes arrogance mixed with a certain world weariness and again labeled him the kingslayer backstabber showing that that is what he is most famous for 18 changed the dothraki seain the book danny rides off alone on her horse into the dothraki sea after commanding the khalasar to halt and wait for her in the tv show she dismounts and wanders off for no apparent reason also in the book shes the one who commands viserys to walk back to camp without a horse something that has much more meaning in the book than it did in the show having jhogo make that decision also in the book it was made clear viserys was enraged after mormont told him to stay on the ridge in the tv show it seemed a little odd that viserys would fly off the handle without recieving a direct commandunimportant changes that helped compress the scene for tv id prefer more time here but truthfully more time has to be spent setting the scene in kings landing19 changed jons final meeting with benjen starkin the book the meeting happened as benjen was riding out for his ranging not at the top of the wallunimportant at this point you are nitpicking for no reason also the conversation that they had did happen on the wall the last meeting was a paragraph in the book there was no reason not to remove it20 changed tyrions meeting in the feast hall of castle blackwe finally get a proper introduction to yoren who seems much less sour than he was in the books and for some reason benjen stark is given all of allister thornes hostility towards tyrionthis was a good change we get to know yoren benjen being hostile plays up the stark vs lannister theme which is good and we didnt have the time to introduce allister thorne enough to care who he was or why he was fighting with tyrion thorne isnt much of a character until later books anyway21 changed the revelation of dannys pregnancyslight change from the books danny is practicing her dothraki when jhiqui tells her shes pregnant in the book danny already knows in the show it takes danny by surprise22 added mormonts scene with jhogo discussing weapons and armorthis was not in the books and in the books jorah never left the khalasar to ride to quohor after discovering danny was pregnanta change made so that internal monologue could be come external dialogue also laying the ground work for jorahs reveal later23 removed jon offering his help to grenn and embarassing thornethough we see jon in the yard helping grenn and pyp we dont see the transformation he goes through in the books heading into the feast hall to offer his help and making fun of ser allister24 changed tyrions talk with mormont and maester aemonmany of mormonts lines were given to maester aemon who comes off more dour and crabby than he does in the books in the books the conversation he has with mormont about the state of the nights watch is done alone at night by a fire here its done with both mormont and maester aemon during the dayunfortunate reductions in the story required by time constraints25 added danny and drogo in bedthe scene where she tells drogo her child will be a boy was not in the booka good addition since we didnt get to see a good start to their relationship we needed evidence that danny is now happy with her marriage26 added tyrion pissing off the top of the wallin the book tyrion never actually pissed off the edge of the world however they seemed to feel the need to show that in the tv series also jon did not ask tyrion to help bran as he did in the book and they completely left out the whole friendship affirmation that preceded the final handshake between jon and tyrioni agree with you on this one i wish they had left in the request to help bran and the line i know what it is to love a brother however jon and tyrion have already been established as friends in the minds of most viewers so its not really damaging27 changed ned watching arya with syrio forellin the books ned was never present at any of aryas trainings also syrio forell was bald in the bookned being present was a good change the ending made us feel neds concern and careoverall i thought the pace of this episode was much to fast and the writers are yet again making strange changes to iconic lines and scenes the best scene in my opinion was arya and syrio since it was the most faithful to the books and worked the best in the show honestly many of these changes are just unnecessary makes me wonder why the producers are doing these changesalso no ghost again what is up with that and come to think of it no sight of mormonts crow either i think you are being overly critical and unwilling to accept that changes must be made for this to work as a tv show i agree there were some changes made that didnt need to be but overall its a pretty good adaption if it feels like it is moving fast thats because it is 12 hours would have been better then 10 but 10 is what we got so 10 is what the writers have to deal with and that means moving fastalso i agree i would have liked to have seen ghost if only in the background during the training sceneslooking forward to next episode id like to say there is an addition i think they ought to have but doubt they willi think during the tourney ned should sit next to robert and move neds comment about the knights of summer theresomething likened theyre so youngrobert not near as young as we werened it reminds me of the tourney at harrenhalrobert the one were rhaegor crowned your sister the queen of love beauty angry he had no right his own wife sitting there wooing another mans betrothed cold anger thats when it all beganned pausing before changing the subject and gesturing at the field the knights of summer i wonder what grief they will know when winter comes for themcut away to sansa with joffreythen at the end of the tourney have the hound crown sansa queen of love and beauty perhaps with instruction by joffrey just a nod of the head toward sansa have sansa hoisted over the crowd chanting queen sansa while cersei looks onthis would accomplish several things1 it reveals more about neds sister rhaegors rape of her and roberts motivation2 it connects back to cerseis instruction to joffrey to preform an act of kindness toward sansa3 it would compare sansa to lyanna which would have been even better if they had kept the aryalyanna comparison this episode and again play on neds emotions and concern for his daughters4 it would be an important moment establishing the hound as a more ambiguous figure5 it would help set up the one sided romantic tension between sansa and the hound that comes up later6 it would help set up cerseis jealousy of the younger more beautiful queen7 it would establish this tradition of the tourney winner as naming a woman queen of love and beauty in the viewers mind more solidly then just a flashback or hearing about it edited by maester cressan 06 may 2011  1040 pm"
"SerArthurHeath",2011-05-07,"quoted texti agree with pretty much everything you have said though i would have liked dany to stand up for herself a little more and am still annoyed that jaime seems to be trying to explain himself to ned  i still think a flashback to the original meeting between the two set off by ned seeing the iron throne would have worked better i dont mind any number of changes as long as they are consistent with characters which all the others areand i agree given that rhaegar seems for a whole number of reasons not just the rl one to be integral to the story in future books i would like to see him mentioned soon edited by terraprime 07 may 2011  0253 pm no need to quote the entirety of a lengthy post just to say you agree"

"Xenophon",2011-05-01,"the previously on game of thrones sure had some r  l  j bait with the cut from ned telling jon you are a stark to robert saying hell kill every targaryen loved jaimes eyes narrowing as ned shot down his it sounded like justice line im loving this version of cersei the scene with her telling joffrey to be kind to the stark girl was brilliant so much pain mixed in with her scheming im loving the costumes we see this episode the maesters chains look way better when you see the full chain on pycelle also the goldcloaks mail veil is very menacing edited by xenophon 01 may 2011  0829 pm"

"blackbrother",2011-05-01,"damn 1 hour passes too quickly great episode syrio was spot on love the water dance giving donal noyes lines to tyrion makes sense in that there are so many characters that some were sure to fall by the wayside i missed the true depth of the jonaliser thorne conflict however danidothraki scenes are getting better every episode old nanbran scene was too cool too biggest disappointment was still the lack of ghost i was also surprised by the scene between cersei and joff i couldnt believe the amount of apathy joff had towards sansa i always knew he was a royal shit but i was pleasantly surprised to what extent they were willing to show it edited by blackbrother 01 may 2011  0917 pm"

"Charles Phipps",2011-05-01,"some general thoughts 1 cersei is a great deal more clever politically than she in the books 2 i liked the scene showing that ned is a horrible dad to sansa but gets arya 3 the long look where stark realizes this war will be fought by my children was good 4 god lancel looks horrible 5 a nice juxtaposition of the fact we assume robert is talking about women when hes talking about murder 6 jaime is about a thousand times calmer and more controlled than in the books  but i think his actor is failing to show his love for cersei in fact all of the lannisters are smarter  which diminishes tyrion a bit i think 7 littlefinger may be a bit too cultured and stylish  theres a lewdness to the book version and a mischief missing here the littlefinger of the show is you know  this brothel was the best place to hide her the literary littlefinger enjoyed the joke on stark honor"

"Social Justice Bass",2011-05-02,"that was an interesting episode although not quite as intense as the last one i think the joffreycersei scene worked well you get that joff is an impulsive brutal idiot and that cersei spoils her son i think cersei really comes across as more calm and collected than she should  her great weakness in the series was not a lack of cunning and wits but her impulsiveness pride and instincts towards cruelty that came through in the last episode but not so well in this one the bitching robert scene was good too i agree that he comes across more as a jerk past his prime bitching about the good old days it still was funny to watch him make fun of poor lancel and his name though and his bit with jaime wasnt too bad either tyrion and jon    im not sure i liked tyrion in the episode but his interactions with jon come across as a little flat i dont blame them for using tyrion instead of donal noye it saves on casting but tyrion really needed to be harsher to jon about it and jon slightly more stuckup until he gets told off moreover they cut jons heartfelt and emotional request to tyrion to help bran and tyrions good response it was nice to viserys go full crazy then get his ass kicked the scene where they crown him with molten gold will likely be overthetop jolting edit i really didnt notice the absence of the direwolves ducks i liked littlefinger although he needs to be a bit more sleazy and arrogant reading the book you can just feel his contempt for ned oozing out whenever hes talking with him edited by wise bass 02 may 2011  1222 am"

"A Song of Hound and Wolves",2011-05-02,"shocked that no one mentioned this but the scene with jaimened is going to mess up the redemption thread of jaimes later on down the line part of tha arc was finally seeing jaimes viewpoint as well as experiencing the slow crumbling of his defences he hadnt told anyone the details of the aery event i am pretty sure that the book says that he figured no one would believe him least of all that judgmental critical cold ned stark paraphrasing to introduce this so early sounds like jaime is whining why dont you wuv me the books make it clear that he realized that ned would never understand him nor appreciate it so i agree with an earlier poster that said jaime sorta seems like an ass just because hes an ass  anyway we dont need to see jaimes inner conflict right now he shouldnt have any inner conflict right now other thoughts  my nonreader husband wondered where the wolves were and thought they were all dead now cause of the last episode   syrio scene was awesome  sean bean continues to pack 5 pages of grrm writing into one long closeup wow hes awesome  i actually liked the scene with robert at least the part which shows camaderie btwn barristan and jaime though there is no reason from the books to believe they would be so chummy it did a lot to suggest that all these characters have complicated intertwined lives and their history together goes back way before the series started kudos  yes this old nan outold naned the old nan in the book p  i betrayed my father ser jorah question  foreshadowing his joining the night watch in the future books  i dont understand the griping on cerseis smarts part of the fun of the series was watching her come undone i remember reading sansas chapter during the battle of the blackwater cersei was drinking and her advice to sansa was actually quite good if heartless but i remember thinking man shes losing it  i liked all the dothraki stuff this week edited by a song of hound and wolves 02 may 2011  1253 am"

"TrueMetis",2011-05-02,"got episode 3 review"
"Sword in the Morning",2011-05-02,"alright after reading the discussion on the first few episodes ive finally decided that i needed an account yes i miss the wolves just like the rest of you buti think its understandable that theyve been kept out think of it this way right now the wolves are in the process of growing from pups into adults that means that for every stage in their growth that the wolves are shown at they need a new dog thats been trained to act for that scene to save the expense and effort why not wait until theyre full grown or at least in a growth stage that will be constant for some time during the series to start featuring the wolves prominently so that they just have to make sure they have these longterm dogs well trained this goes especially for ghost do you have any idea how hard it would be to find an albino wolfdog that can be adequately trained for each and every stage of growth that the wolf goes through yeesh i shudder to think better to just have one once hes bigger so i think he should be showing up more often within the next few episodes i remember when reading that i thought cersei was quite crafty and cunning up until tyrion showed up in kings landing and swinging his intellectual weight around even then however she still had some surprises in store for him it wasnt until she finally unraveled that she became pathetic i think jaime looks the part beyond what i could have ever imagined they could cast forbut at the same time i feel like his lines arent as dripping with his wry humor as i read them in the books edit i knew immediately that it was barristan in the room with jaime and robert i was busy musing over how badly they messed up on the kingsguard costumes what would possess them not to go with the full white its so distinctive makes them identifiable for viewers and its a very compelling part of their identity jaime sitting on the iron throne in his gold armor not the white it makes all the difference edited by profnirvana 02 may 2011  0138 am"

"Iotun",2011-05-02,"hi there first time poster here i just literally found out they were making a got show this weekend and have just finished watching the first 2 episodes still havent watched the 3rd but im getting around to it i just wanted to comment about cercei i think the way she is being portrayed in the show is much fitting in my opinion in that it gives her a much stronger and more believable arc  she starts getting more paranoid after joffrey is killed it also fits in more with the overall theme of how power corrupts the people who get it and magnifies their weaknesses in their desire to keep it as she is effectively queen at the time of her greatest paranoia i think their depiction makes the character much more grey and more developed and also much more tragic maybe its also because i actually really like her as a character  i dont like the hate she seems to be getting by so many fans and also did not like the way she was treated by grrm in book 4 but then again i disliked so much of that book in general cercei is such a tragic character in my opinion  her mother dies and she grows up in the most powerful family in the realm but has to be held back by her sex is married off to a man who doesnt love her or care for her or respect her very visibly so is constantly shamed by him is essentially accused of crimes she did not commit which eventually leads to war and is effectively willing to do anything to protect her children rather than for her own personal power compare her to ned  is his pride and honor and conservative faith in robert so praiseworthy when they lead the realm to war"

"The hairy bear",2011-05-02,"one thing i didnt like from roberts scene is that i have the feeling barristan should really despise jaime for betraying his vows and killing aerys jaime embodies everything a man like ser barristan would hate but their interaction recalling the fight against the brotherhood suggested otherwise it felt odd to mesyrio was bald nose like a hawk with a thick braavosian accent the curly hair makes me think of the guy who wanted us all to paint happy little trees but that makes me love the scenes all the moreperhaps they did this as an homage to the great swordsman iaigo montoya the looks are remarkably similar my name is syrio forel you killed my father prepare to die"

"Kaitscralt",2011-05-02,"okay i dont have time right now for a full review but here are a few things that were bothering me sansa and arya and eddard talking about the hound im not sure if sandor has even been introduced as the hound yet and there is no reason for the nonreader to make that connection they probably are wondering who it is or why theyre talking about a direwolf similarly after eddard only says lord baelish at the council meeting catelyn then refers to him as petyr to eddard when littlefingers not there so nonreaders may be saying who is petyr even moreso in the next scene her and eddard are talking about littlefinger without ever explaining the name or who they are referencing dont give the nonreader too much credit i did have to let my dog out around this time so perhaps i missed an explanation or clearer defining that lord baelish  petyr  littlefinger finally when the bloodrider has the whip around viserys neck the hand maiden is translating for him and she keeps saying the khal wants to know if you want him dead the khal this the khal that was i mishearing her was she saying something else or was she referencing drogo despite him not being in the scene as if he had told them to go and attack viserys or was it just an oversight on the writers part i was a bit distracted during some of this episode so if my three points are off then please correct me"
"Kilroy",2011-05-02,"all of this has been mentioned already so i guess im typing it for my own benefit the pacing of the story is very odd as a viewer if i had not read the books i would not know how much time had passed i would know some time had passed but would have no idea how much and hence i would be confused by the interaction of some characters also they will eventually have to start flashing up location names in the top left when their story starts to really spread out understand where the hell you are in the realm is important and just showing locations without some help will mean that viewers without the reading background may wonder where they are i believe they left out very important parts of the book that really had no good reason to be left out because putting them in would have taken no real time at all examples dany when in the big grass getting attacked by visy in the books we know it is her that tells them to take his horse and make him walk by she saying it it implies she is growing a spine against her brother and that she is beginning to not fear him but by making her dothraki guard do it it doesnt give me the same impression that she is really getting stronger towards visy the interaction showing dany is pregnant was also odd since we know why it happens in the book that a couple of months earlier she had a very special moment with drogo under the sky i think they missed that special moment the pregnancy doesnt seem as important in the scene if it wasnt for mormont getting up and leaving suddenly they could have eluded in their dialog to each other catelyn and ser rodrik cassel that they came by ship and that the ship got them there quickly i dont really see why they changed that time line she could still be coming into the city with the ship docks in the background then after going to a stock inn which we know they have as sets she is confronted by the guard and escorted to littlefinger in the brothel i thought the trip by sea was important to show how they get there so fast i also agree that the arya scene seemed less personal and more just a pep talk from ned to arya could have easily shown arya running off in a spat and having ned come in a few seconds later and ask what happened and then go up after her also whats with sansas attitude she doesnt have that yet shes still in dreaming lala prince is going to marry me land tyrion telling snow about how the recruits are not trained instead of the master smith and doing so with them still in the room was kind of an odd scene tyrion pissing off the wall was something he said as a jest and never actually did it in the book jon asking tyrion to lend some words to bran was not done which i was disappointed with and one of the biggest things benjen stark was still there i suppose it worked but damn was i slightly irritated with him not having a small talk with snow earlier and being gone by this time like i said it worked but i was thinking about it too much the entire scene i understand that they pushed scenes together changed dialog to use less actors in scenes etc i understand all that however i still think there were key parts in the books that really needed to be in the show to demonstrate just a bit more character depth and development the characters are quite rich by tv standards but with just a little better choice of added scenes i think they could be better and they better have hodor in there another understated yet important character in my eyes"

"Pink Walder Frey",2011-05-02,"i was kind of disappointed about the scenes in castle black its understandable to leave out a character like donal noye because of his few appearances and give his lines to someone else and the choice of tyrion seems a wise one too but i think the scenes were paced much too fast and there is some loss of depth to jon becoming friend with pyp and grenn and also the general idea of them all being brothers there also a complete loss of the trouble between thorne and jon apart from this one scene  i would have liked him to ask jon if he is now the weaponsmaster  maybe itll come in a later episode but anyway for me there are too much lines provided by or to the wrong person  completly differing from the book  certainly they show the same development to the characters but it just feels odd i also missed jon and tyrion calling each other friend and jon asking him to help bran like he helped him understandble as the relationship wasnt developed like in the book skipping catelyns ship journey is understandble to me it wouldnt serve the plot or the character development but im also a bit disappointed about changing some timelines  catelyn arriving after ned tyrion will leaving before benjen is missing maybe it is not really so important but a bit annoying i really liked the scene with the small council iirc there were not enough chairs for the whole council if everyone was present and the littlefinger scenes were great too  i liked him and varys and even pycelle but for the littlefinger scenes i thought them also a bit too fast paced  there were some parts of scenes and also some of the new scenes the jaimiened was great done but the scene with robertbarristanjaimielancel someone should buy him a new cap didnt provide so much that i would liked to have skipped and instead gave some other scenes a bit more time to develop more depth another point that annyoed me was ned giving sansa a doll and short after that providing sword training to the younger arya well and arya and syrio were just awesome even if syrio differs a bit my imaginations"
"Lord Varys",2011-05-02,"this show really makes me love joffrey truly that boy is a true revolutionary a standing army thats actually a great idea it would be a project for a generation or so but the royal house should really think about that to make themselves less dependent on their lords as to cersei she is exactly like the cersei in the books if you ask me the scene with jaime  which is by the way no new scene but a scene that happens in the books as well although we learn about it only through jaimes memories  introduces us to cerseis fickleness when stuff is not working out the way she imagined it she wanted jaime to throw bran out of the tower thats very clear in the series when she says two times he saw us only afterwards when things dont work out the way should have she blames jaime for it and her advice to joffrey  who actually had the guts to admit that he was beaten by arya  she tells that truth and reality can be changed by royal decrees thats exactly the way cersei lannister thinks that reality is not what it is but what it should be and its a trait she inherited from tywin who embodies that kind of weird thinking but whereas tywin is still able to differentiate between appearance and reality cersei cannot no one taught her how to do that they all said she will always get what she wants because she wants it as to the episode itself i liked most of it until i realized they wont give us drogo and dany out there among the khalasar i really expected them to give us that after emilia actually tells us that all important things in the life of the dothraki have to happen outside under the sky instead they give us rakharo and irri as human beings which in my opinion is completely pointless they are nothing more that better extras through the all of the books and they should be treated as such the time line is mixed up as well which somewhat makes varys and littlefinger a lot more powerful than they should be to this point if they are able to hide cat and ser rodrik from the lannisters renly and robert himself with them being in the city varys going to littlefinger instead of directly to ned really has to mean he and littlefinger are involved in the jon arryn affair the actors of both these guys convinced me varys can play the effeminate eunuch well now we have to wait and see if he can play his other sides as well littlefinger is funny and to an extent dangerous as you can really see that his assurances to catelyn were not really convincing but they failed to explain to the audience that neds elder brother really was the guy who should have married cat the way people see them they might have thought their marriage was a marriage for love the whole brandon business should be cleared up in the next episode pycelle is as boring clumsy and old as he described again and again in the books very good i liked the hug between renly and ned as well ned has to know the child renly and ned would be some kind of distant uncle he sees once or twice in a decade or so unfortunately ned forgot to inquire about stannis it would have been a great opportunity to establish that robert has in fact two brothers the selmyrobertjaime scene had great dialogue but i really did not like the setting it would have been much better with robert being accompanied by jaime and barristan to a brothel that really sounds like something robert would do to jaime and they sharing war stories on their way back maybe with robert and selmy in a litter and jaime walking beside it im actually particularly interested about the tarly boy story thats intriguing and considering the story about the tyroshi barristans first kill might have been during the war of the ninepenny kings and simon toyne and the kingswood brotherhood i gather the story about roberts first kill comes directly from grrm so we really should learn someday who this particular tarly boy was a younger brother of randyll who squired for some stormlord most likely as he else would not have fought at the battle of summerhall i really hope stannis finds some excuse to talk about that battle in the future as its unlikely that he too had his first kill back then and the burn them all line was as unexpected as it was brilliant they really know how to foreshadow things they will dig into later on and roberts look really showed he had no idea about the whole thing arya and syrio were really fun to see they are really getting this right although i too missed neds line about arya resembling lyanna"

"Greywolf2375",2011-05-02,"been thinking back over the episode even during the watching of it my first thought with nans setting and voice was shed scare the shit out of me on a sunny summer day talking about puppies and rainbows hearing her tell scary storiesida never slept as has been said through the other two episodes  the characters need to be introduced a littlre more cleanly having robert throw in a barristan what was your isnt going to throw off pacing but will identify who he is talking to theon same thing then as they did with jaime they can throw in the nicknames  littlefinger kingslayer etc with that im actually kind of ok without having the direwolves present as much there are all ready so many characters moving through that adding them in  especially growing  probably would add to the confusion they are central in many of the scenes later so i am just hoping that we are not seeing them until they are full grown by the time they would be adults or close enough we will be able to see ghost summer etc they dealing with jorah well i like the transition to listening to dany over viserys and the look he gives the bloodrider not sure which it was i cant remember from the books  did he excuse himself to leave the khalasar like that to send notice that dany was pregnant just seemed like it would be more noticeable  with his king and his khaleesi here can he just leave"

"Rockroi",2011-05-02,"the bitching robert scene was good too i agree that he comes across more as a jerk past his prime bitching about the good old days it still was funny to watch him make fun of poor lancel and his name though and his bit with jaime wasnt too bad eitheri do not think he was bitching about the good old days or more specifically i think his bitching was how much he really hates these current daysthe scene with jaime selmy and king robert was my favorite but that may have been only because its brand new and i crave more of this world but that scene was so very robert and jaime robert starts off by casually entering into conversation with selmy over the first man he ever slew and robert played better and better by robert addy is not just waxing nostalgic about the way he used to be hes depressed about what life his victory bought him robert talks about how stupid that tarly kid was for coming at him hes deep in the revolution by then and for a brief second we are ion the swamp with robert as that dumb lad wades after him and then robert slams his chest in and robert can remember what this kid said wait wait but addys robert takes no pride in the kill he does not seem ashamed of it either but then thinks about how that kid could have survived stay on the periphery dont extend and then you get the real reason roberts upset had that dumb lad stayed on the periphery hed be alive today with a wife yelling at him getting up three times a night to piss in a bowl wine in other words robert and not this dumb lad and not rhaegar is left in the world of the living slugging through the mundane of daytoday life the wife he does not love the job he does not want the children he does not have affection for the friends he no longer sees the power he cannot use the abilities he has long lost the shadow he can still glimpse at of what he once was addys robert looks distant  right past selmy as he tries to remember what it was like to kill to almost die what it was like to live on that razors edge what it was like to be robert baratheon now now hes just king robert the fat lonely middleaged man and desperate to share something with others like him ned selmy even jaime even that dumb lad he killed who almost robert seems to think was the lucky one thats the good side of robert he craves human connection with men during war with women most other times he loved jon and he misses ned but then there is the bad siderobert is very unhappy about what his life has become so when wine is not available what does he do his misery needs company he yells for the kingslayer specifically calls him that jaime walks in with those dolls eyes dead eyes where the actor is nailing jaime like jaime nails cersei you know hes not really looking at you hes looking past you where he can forget you ever existed but its roberts discussion he drags jaime in to taunt insult berate and potentially embarrass jaime no dice robert jaime lets it all wash off him like aerys blood from his sword he answers the questions but without the bitterness that has crept into roberts life jaime is not bitter see heis not bitter he is of the kg that he fucks cersei or that he killed aerysor that he pushed bran out a window jaime lannister is fine with the choices he has made and its perfectly obvious and robert cannot stomach that because it seems just as obvious that robert is not happy with his choices and all the while there is the dignified selmy teetering between the two swore and oath to aerys happy to serve but also there was a life he could have had that he does not yet long for when joff releases him he longs for it its the third episode in a row where robert has openly longed for another life e1 life with lyanna e2 life as an outlaw e3 death i also want to state that i loved jaimes response to ned when talking about aerys how the judgmental ned reminds jaime that he stabbed aerys in the back jaimes response is practically ripped right from these boards had i stabbed him in the belly instead of the back would that have been better in other words what death to aerys would have satisfied you ned the perpetually unsatisfyiable"
"Ser Latecomer",2011-05-02,"i do think the pacing was a bit off this episode but it was necessary because there was still so much exposition to get to before the action really starts in earnest next week two scenes in particular the catlfned scene in the brothel and the first meeting of the small council just seemed rushed to me with all the actors firing off their lines in rapid succession the tournament tyrion being captured jaime confronting ned ned confronting cersie viserys getting crowned all of this should be in the next episode or two and it is going to be an avalanche from their to the end picking up speed each week my kindle version of agot shows i am 60 through my reread and i have just finished the ned chapter describing the night robert lay in his deathbed assuming ten percent of the book per episode which has held fairly true for the first three that means we have 3 episodes to get from where we are now to the point where stuff really hits the fani have read the complaints about the cerseijoffrey scene but i think it was very necessary i am rereading agot right now and one scene in the book needs this exposition in a visual medium i think during the tournament joffrey is a perfect gentleman to sansa even sansa is slightly taken aback as she had not really interacted with him since the incident on the kings road however as soon as drunken robert blows up and yells at cersei with cersei storming off joffrey grows cold and dumps sansa off on the hound to be escorted back to her quarters i think the television scene establishes that joffrey really cares nothing for sansa but will be treating her well during the tournament for his mothers sakealso i must agree with many of the commenters that cersie in agot was cunning and shrewd or at least would appear that way to a reader who is only seeing the results of her actions she wins the first round and we have no pov chapter yet to see what is going on inside her head her scene with ned in the godswood followed by the flurry of events that end with her victorious for this first round leave the impression that she was in control or at least was shrewd enough to win over lf and viserys"

"The Iceman of the North",2011-05-02,"one thing i didnt like from roberts scene is that i have the feeling barristan should really despise jaime for betraying his vows and killing aerys jaime embodies everything a man like ser barristan would hate but their interaction recalling the fight against the brotherhood suggested otherwise it felt odd to mei dont know about that selmy knew how mad aerys were he might even have known about the plans to burn kl and he did betray aerys as well eventually he might not have done what jaime did but i believe hes pragmatic enough not to have a nedlike irrational reaction to jaime"

"Ran",2011-05-02,"my general take on barristan and jaime is that barristan is if nothing else courteous he would have maintained an appropriate level of contact with jaime  but he could never have warmed to him when he finds out jaime is named to replace him he saysthe kingslayer ser barristan said his voice hard with contempt the false knight who profaned his blade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defendhe didnt like jaime and jaime would have known it barristan would also doubtless give jaime his due  he might have volunteered the way jaime killed the outlaw in a cool polite reluctant way  but i doubt jaime would ever have praised barristan to his face or that they would be so collegialso as far as that goes it seems an opportunity lost to show how the institution is sort of torn apart by what jaime did"

"Xenophon",2011-05-02,"a few thoughts on rewatching the episode great juxtaposition of cerseis telling joffrey that everyone else is an enemy with neds telling arya that the starks have to stick together similar advice in a way but also very differentwhich neatly sums up the compares and contrasts the two families i also loved the nedjaime scene jaime really seemed to hope that ned would react well to his claim that killing the mad king felt like justice he looked eversobriefly wounded by neds contemptuous reply before quickly withdrawing behind his usual sardonic mask"

"thorny throne",2011-05-02,"ah at long last im home to watch big props for just so  i mouthed the words right before they were suppose to be said hoping id hear it because they slightly changed several of the lines before thatlike arya saying not really instead of not truly which irked me and where the heck was and not the man i fear he has become they need to introduce a man and his nickname littlefingers switching three <U+009E>ames in one episode wasnt good speaking of littlefinger  this is where cats aging is bothersome she looks 10 years older than little finger at least shes suppose to be just several years older like 2 or 3 years not more a bit hard to imagine him in love with her the actor is great though so was varys exactly as ive pictured him the fondness between selmey and jaime was weird on the other hand not quite enough fondness between jaime and cersei i would have loved to see a passionate kiss again  missing a bit of the love aspect of their relationship is it icky to say i rooted for them during book 1 there were times when i wanted jaime to get the girl even if she was his sister lol anyway im invested in that relationship and id like to see it evolved before they are seperated i thought it was interesting that arya asked ned how he could let sansa marry joffery she didnt in the book and it was an important question nan was brilliant and brad saying id rather die was one of the highlights of the episode edited by thorny throne 02 may 2011  0506 pm"

"Ellroy",2011-05-02,"the episode was quite good and i loved to see some scene of the book bringed to life i loved old nan scene and the final with syrio forel still i think that it was the weaker episode of the series so far too dense too many plots that only touches the surface of things especially the cateddardlf situation it was so brief that it sounded forced in many ways if i never read the books i would strongly question the timeline of events but mostly i really dont like the cersei of the tv series she is nothing like the book i cant see those glimpse of bitchness and madness that charachterize her so strongly from the beginning and i agree that her relationship with jaime seems one dimensional she allways seem to protect herself from jaimes attention edited by ellroy 02 may 2011  0514 pm"

"Aoife",2011-05-02,"its not terribly clear in the inside the episode video dd talk about how shes really starting to be affected by the plight of the slaves particularly given what similarities she sees to her own life so whether she needs to just ground herself after watching the man be whipped or wanted to try to find him to talk to him that was the ultimate cause for her halt"

"Mazikeen",2011-05-02,"finally watched the episode today twice and told my mother who hasnt read the book to start watching the series i really enjoyed it my biggest complain is a lack of cohesiveness and the timelines being muddled here and there there is only one council meeting but the way that part is edited may make it seem like twothe sets are great kings landing is slightly different than i envisioned it but i liked it very much and the marked difference between what weve seen so far in the north someone made a good point that its a little too similar with pentos perhaps but they are on the same latitude so it makes sense that the climate is similar and perhaps the architecture as welli like the tv version of cersei a lot to me she doesnt come across as too smart or too composed i think shes just fine at this point and a strong female character that is needed since they took the edge out of catelyn a little sniff the only things that didnt fit so well was that bit about whores and virgin noble girls in her conversation with joffrey considering that this is what she has to suffer from robert also id like to see her a little more relaxed and affectionate with jaimei think the danyviserys scene in the grass was wellhandled in the books we get danys internal monologue to show us her change in perspective regarding viserys and a lot of little details they couldnt have fitted in the tv series so this scene served to show dany that viserys is not quite as scary and dangerous and she now has people to protect her so i can well see that in the next episodes shell start to actually stand up to himloved the interactions between rakharo and the handmaiden in both scenes  rakharos look of disbelief and her tiny shrug when she relays danys order not to hurt viserys then the entire conversation about rabbits and ducks and dogs spoken dothraki sounds really good and fits very well the only nitpick is that the handmaiden should probably have been mounted to better emphasize the humiliation of viserys being made to walk but then there wouldnt have been anyone to help dany mount i guesscatelyn wears a silver fish pin on her dress when she arrives in kl nice touchinteresting scene between ser jorah and rakharo maybe a hint that taking back seven kingdoms with a horde of dothraki screamers may not be as easy as viserys makes it sound since their weapons are likely ineffective against heavy armouri think the brothel where littlefinger takes cat is chatayas theres a baby crying in the background and several darkskinned womeni really cannot make out what neds last line is in the scene with him and jaimie you served him well something something safe also why is the floor in the throne room so dirtyi very much like this new yoren and his bears ballsvarys and pycelle are perrrfect i expected littlefinger to be better dressed or at least more colourful and with less stubble he works very well otherwisebenjen seemed a touch overdramatic on the wall also no frosty breath when he and jon were talking and generally very little of it in the castle black scenes edited by mazikeen 02 may 2011  0801 pm"

"Holymoly",2011-05-03,"regarding all the discussion about cerseis character i think you need to bear in mind that the book is set in a fantasy world running parallel with ours while their world is broadly similar you have the inordinately long seasons and you have the vaguely mythological beasts at the same time their world is one where incest is not the huge deal it is in our present society indeed the targaryen dynasty was based upon it in the same way of certain societies in our worlds past therefore i dont see cerseis predeliction for jaime as being a symptom of insanity rather that she truly believes as does her father that she would have been the perfect male heir and it is her way of tasting what might have been she as jaimes twin is even more intimately entwined with this notion than if it had been simply a question of genetics cerseis character is one of a scheming power hungry person ultimately frustrated by her sex consequently she attempts to exert her influence through control of her brother and her son unfortunately in the later books even these means are denied to her for me cersei is the central character of the books to date around whom the story twists and turns while cat through her bad decisions inadvertantly sends westeros down dark alleyways cersei remains on track until she is let down by others tyrion may provide the humour that makes the books popular it is cerseis story that provides the core that enables the author to continue writing the series"

"Arya The Assassin",2011-05-03,"theres also input from network execs and however many other producers ive worked on tv shows with more than 13 producers listed so the idea of an auteur is way gone in a corporate miasma of group thinkone of the reasons why the screenwriter andor showrunner is considered more creatively significant than the director in tv shows is because the director is often more limited both creatively and authoritatively than a feature film director of course a tv series is a major group effort but yet there are key persons who are often considered more significant from a creative standpoint than other members of the crew some people argue that on a tv show the showrunner whose responsibilities arent just limited to writing and producing is the only person who can really be seen as an auteur the showrunners on got is david benioff and david benioff its worth nothing that these filmmakers just like david milch deadwood were not involved in any directing duties which also underlines the smaller significance of the director in tv series compared to feature films one could also argue that productions with too many producers or decisionmakers little or no focus on creative control tend not to do so well from a creativeartistic standpointthe term auteur shouldnt necessarily be confused with full or absolute creative power because even feature film directors are rarely true auteurs directors such as james cameron and george lucas  and even the coen brothers  are one of the few exceptions since they write direct and produce their own films the first two directors are also highly influential in the business due to their financial successes however auteur theory argues that the directors vision is still clearly visible despite the collaborative efforts and pressure from above in the studiofilmmaking hierarchy today feature film directors are still considered to be the most prominent key figures behind a film despite efforts to increase the creative importance of screenwriters and theyre also the persons who usually takes the blame or credit if things go right or wrong"

"Brewmaster",2011-05-03,"but they need to get a little bit of momentum going with him to give us a reason to care about what ultimately happensmaybe maybe not i dont think the book gave us all that much reason to care about what happened to drogo either the main reason that its a factor is because of danys position not because we care about drogo dany has just become strong and then realizes that her position is very tenuous if drogo dies she may be forced to go back to vaes dothrak and be a crone or be killed and her child killed for sure to get the stallion who mounts the world out of the picturedrogo himself though meh as a reader are you ever really rooting for him to conquer the world do you really care if he lives or dies i cant say that i ever did edited by brewmaster 03 may 2011  0516 pm"
"TerraPrime",2011-05-03,"i agree i care about drogo only in relation to danys position in the khalasar the first readthrough it wasnt clear that drogo is just there for the studding but once you go past book1 thats pretty clear in a way drogo has to die so that dany can continue her journey else shed still be under drogos thumb so not spending a whole lot of time in developing screendrogo is okay with me"
"Kalbear",2011-05-03,"i dont think nonreaders will pick up on the duplicity yet its the dagger in act1 so to speakmany already have and his duplicity is found out to us pretty quickly in the books its the impetus that causes ned to resign his hand so its not like its moving that much forward"

"IheartTesla",2011-05-03,"maybe i was reading too much into it but theres a moment with renly sort of in the background and he brushes back a piece of hair or something that gesture to me seemed purposely effeminatedelicate i think renly has to be played fairly subtle its kind of subtle in the books and hes definitely not overtly effeminate hopefully there will be more hints in renlys dress and mannerism as the show progressesmack this was what i was referring to although it may be that we are seeing things we want to see at any rate i was a bit vague because even though this is a spoiler thread you need the first three books to get a complete picture of renly and i dont think everyone in this thread has read all the way to book 3anyway since that horse has bolted a bit yeah renly"

"vgz",2011-05-03,"i was a late reader to the books and i am just finishing with book 2 however i find the jon on the wall arc so far not too interesting as for tierion giving advice to jon i found that somewhat a bit farfetched for someone of tierions station and background in fact in the books he seems to come off as very smart but devious and as most lannisters selfserving someone answered my commentquestion regarding whether he was bad good evil smart etc and the answer seemed to be all three i now see that that is trueas for the dany and drogo arc i am not too impressed by that either in fact in bk 2 some of the writing seemed to me to be rather i do not want to say unbelievable because it is a fantasy but i have to say it did not move me to want to read more as for the duplicity of montmort i did not catch that as a nonreader at the time when it was hinted at his being a spy intested to see where that becomes known to dany i always want to read more of arya hoping she comes upon her wolf and kicks ascierci now that is another character i love to hate how can she be so oblivious to how her son treats sansa and others and if she does see it ignore it then when it is time for her to send her own daughter to become bethrothed she sends out almost all the guards she can to keep her safe that shows you how really selfish and yes not balanced in her mind joeffry says that his mother told him it was not proper to hit his bethrothedwife so what does he do he has one of his knights do it waiting for when all the evil crazies get whats coming to them someone correct me if i am on the wrong track with my comments as i said i am new to the books but still enjoy the tv series"
