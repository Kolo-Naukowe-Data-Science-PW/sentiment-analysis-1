"RAddichio",2011-05-29,"i gave ep 7 a 9notice most people so far gave it an 8 im not usually easy to please so wonder why an 8 for tonight episode plenty of time at the wall which made the man watching with me very happy  those are his fav scenes lord baelish was brilliantly sinister as always and managed to surprise in the last few frames even though i knew what to expect from him the actor is simply brilliant in that rolefits him like a glove as drogo gave his dothraki campaign speech we uttered vote for me rolleyes2gif classbbcemoticon altrolleyes "
"MusaYo",2011-05-29,"i gave it a 9 also i liked it more than the previous episode i thought it kept the tension of what was happening and about to happen and loved the scene between ned and robert at the end i will miss mark addy i thought drogos scene was very well done and appreciate momoas effort to learn dothraki so that it sounds totally believable"
"NW Deserter",2011-05-29,"lord baelish was brilliantly sinister as always and managed to surprise in the last few frames even though i knew what to expect from him the actor is simply brilliant in that rolefits him like a glove as drogo gave his dothraki campaign speech we uttered vote for me rolleyes2gif classbbcemoticon altrolleyes my opinions are the oppositei absolutely loved drogo in this episode but am dislike aiden gillen more and more with every episode littlefinger is probably the biggest disappointment of the series for me hes just flat and uninspiredi gave this episode a 75 leaning towards 7 though i thought it was one of the weaker episodes so far i actually gave 5 and 6 both 1010 there were some high points for me such as jaimetywin drogo being a badass jorah and dany and hearing the nw oathbut everything else with average or a bit below the standards this series has set for itself roberts death in particular was way too emotioneless and the roswhore b scene with lf was just dumb i did appreciate oshas scene with luwin and theon though"
"CelticCail",2011-05-29,"6 my lowest score yet"
"Popgun",2011-05-29,"1010 best episode to date for me nights watch vows and drogos speech were particular highlights"
"Starkess",2011-05-29,"gave it an 8 would have been a 9 if not for the awful lfporn scene"
"ExLibris",2011-05-29,"i give it a 6the worst episode to date the porn scene was really off putting and drawn out to the extremei dont mind throwing in some sex and nudity but 5 minutes of pretty hardcore girl on girl sex is way over the top not to mention it totally overshadowed the importance of what littlefinger was saying tywin is a disappointment in his first appearance and roberts death was poorly done in my opinion i dont think ned even shed a tear or gave any indication that he was incredibly upset at the passing of his best friend thankfully the episode ended on an upswing as the final throne room scene was done well i also enjoyed the dothraki scenes for once and i think khal drogo finally stepped up and gave an excellent performance all in all i hope the next episode is better and that the hardcore porn doesnt reappear"
"Noir Dove",2011-05-29,"people seem to be pretty split i for one loved it the lf porn scene was most likely done for the sex bit but i could see past it lf was talking and the actions of the girls was mirroring what he was doing to the realm something fake that seems good but dont get me wrong i totally understand why some would find it off putting and distracting im just not one of them sooo happy jon is back i love that man sam is brilliant drogo was simply awesome you could see how much anger he felt and the almost hysteric sound of his voice it was just awesome wish theyd put episode 8 up early biggringif classbbcemoticon altd "
"Bronn Stone",2011-05-30,"gave it an 8 would have been a 9 if not for the awful lfporn scenethat scene took it from an 11 to a 10 in my book i thought it was otherwise just about perfect"
"Arrogant Bastard",2011-05-30,"i gave it a 10 easily my favorite episode of the series so far i did think the brothel scene was a bit over the top but i still enjoyed littlefingers long speech and i didnt think it was out of character for him either loved charles dance as tywin cant wait to see him interact with tyrion probably next week also enjoyed the theonosha talk and i really liked maester luwins line are the two mutually exclusive in your expereince the throne room scene at the end was probably my favorite scene in teh whole series up to this point it really ratcheted up the tension and was practically identical to the scene in the book my only complaint was roberts death scene i wish they showed ned more upset at his friends passing and kept roberts line about being with lyanna"
"elmis",2011-05-30,"one of the best ones so far a solid 10 if they had cut the roz scene actually play with her ass should deduct two points but i gave it a 9 regardless smilegif classbbcemoticon alt "
"Lews",2011-05-30,"people seem to be pretty split i for one loved it the lf porn scene was most likely done for the sex bit but i could see past it lf was talking and the actions of the girls was mirroring what he was doing to the realm something fake that seems goodbut dont get me wrong i totally understand why some would find it off putting and distracting im just not one of themthis it may seem like it was just simple porn and in a way it was but at the same time it was a fantastic visual of lfs actions and excellent foreshadowing i loved the episode tywins introduction was great in my opinion and it was good to see more jon not quite sure why they trimmed the oath but i didnt notice it while watching so obviously not a bother great to get more from drogo besides grunting and sex toomy one complaint would be that there was no arya tyrion or much varys if only each episode was two hours long"
"Daenerys",2011-05-30,"another solid 8 from me agree with others that the porn is just way too over the top drawn out and distracting and also agree roberts death was lacking resonance and man am i going to miss mark addy he was just fantastic from start to finish did love the mournful sound of the bells of baelor in the background though one thing that seemed odd to me was littlefinger actually holding a knife to neds throat was that really in the book seemed to out of character for me littlefinger is a guy who makes his living behind the scenes and disguising his loyalties he schemes but hes hands off when it comes to fighting i think hed feel that was not only beneath him but not wise to stick his neck out like that for all to see well another very good episode overall that just missed the mark in a few places to keep it from touching me deeply missing arya and tyrion already sadgif classbbcemoticon alt "

"Imp",2011-05-30,"last week i gave a 9 this week got an 8 purely on the basis of the littlefinger exposition  lesbian sex scene way way over the top"
"Ealdorman Halasahr",2011-05-30,"i gave it a 7 out of 10 i think the scene in the brothel was a unworthy of grrms writing done in someany other way perhaps and still including the littlefinger speech the episode might have gotten 8 out of 10 but not now not ever and why is lord tywin butchering an animal in his pavilion shouldnt some of his servants be doing just that nice hard acting though by charles dance im glad tywin lannister isnt my father"

"Loras",2011-05-30,"i gave this episode a 9 mark addy was brilliant as robert his final scene really stole the show for me there is so much depth to the friendship between eddard and robert and i got it in that scene it was excellent i enjoyed his interaction with joff too which was all too rare in the book addys performance had such a strong sense of regret to it also outstanding was the writing for cersei headey has impressed me in nearly every scene and this week was no different the confrontation in the gods wood was beautifully done she really captured the cersei from the novels in that moment as well as the scene in the throne room which was wonderfully executed that is until it came to the action section where the whole thing went a bit flat props too to the actors behind ser barristan and renly excellent work in their scenes the downside for me in this episode was the scenes set at the wall  particularly the nights watch vows i found them to be flat and very monotone when reading the books i found the vows stirring and inspiring though there was none of that here"
"WightWolf",2011-05-30,"and why is lord tywin butchering an animal in his pavilion shouldnt some of his servants be doing just that nice hard acting though by charles dance im glad tywin lannister isnt my father quote i like that he butchered the animal a stag btw like he was ripping the guts right out of the house of baratheon shows that he chose to butcher the animal obviously he could have had it done but he chose it seven hells he has a chest of drawers in his tent gave it an 8 littlefinger scene was over the top mormont is underrated as a character and his importance to the story"

"Lokhtar",2011-06-04,"well of course there would there were fans who didnt watch lotr because it didnt follow the books as closely as theyd have liked but it was a successful adaptation nonetheless you cant take a book and just put it on screen  its a different medium and especially if its a book which was written precisely because the author was tired of the limitations that tvmovies imposed it doesnt make sense to force it"

"Eponine",2011-05-30,"was lukewarm on the episode  nothing that really drove me crazy but definitely not as good as last weeks and none of the scenes blew me away with awesomeness i thought there were a lot of unnecessary characterization changes enjoyed the tywin scene it was a good introduction and a good way to keep jaime current i had a hard time with cersei this episode felt like she was an actress delivering lines instead of a person having a conversation as a book fan i cant possibly condone the characterization of littlefinger running his mouth about his feelings for cat to his new whore roberts death was fine but lacked the intensity of the his conversation with ned the previous week i dont like how osha is being portrayed i find her voice crazy annoying and her character overacted jon is a twat and im fine with this id be disappointed if he werent why is he not wearing all black i like sam 1000 more than in the books though  its better not to be stuck in certain peoples heads jon doesnt deserve a friend like him but hey jon rarely deserves anything he gets renly is also a twat and an idiot if he thought that declaring his desire for kingship to ned would win him any support i like book renly much better and his plan to help ned become the real power as regent was a much better idea but unlike several people i thought that littlefinger was great i dont find dany or the dothraki convincing in any way poor ned its hard to watch him sometimes he seemed so clueless and outmatched just like he should but another littlefinger mischaracterization yeah people who dont like nitpickers can go well you know sorry i wasnt that impressed with this episode it wasnt bad but i thought that last week was really well done and neither the scenes nor the acting in this one compared well concern for the end of the season dont feel at this point any particular liking for robb or feel any reason to root for him in what comes next in this i feel the same way with the show as with the book but think its a flaw in the book that the show could have improved upon"
"ENikolai",2011-05-30,"another fantastic episode i love the nights watch scenes the most ive found i wasnt very happy with the gratuitous sex scene though and i suspect that rahm emanuel would make a far better littlefinger not a compliment to mr emanuel the only thing im truly unhappy with overall is the actor they chose for renly baratheon as hes too much of a stereotypical weak and effeminate gay person its been a while since i read the books but i remember renly as being almost as manly as robert and with a huge mane of black hair regardless of this thumbs up this will probably be my favourite tvseries until the day i die"

"Mya Stone",2011-05-30,"sigh you guys are a bunch of wet blankets i thoroughly enjoyed the tywinjaime scene the beauty of it was that he could still instill so much fear in his own son without even making eye contact with him and when you did get the tywin stare it chilled you to the bone at least it did for me not to mention the distance between the two characters speaking once tywin walks over to jaime and places his hand on his cheek you get the feeling that this is the most affectionate hes been to his firstborn son in years  if not ever the irony of the fact that his hands were just more intimately gutdeep in stag is not lost on me but with that motion he tells jaime that it is time for him to become the man he was destined to be and goshdarnit doesnt that just inspire jaimeand yeah yeah symbolism blah blah but i appreciated the fact that tywin handled the stag with such efficiency he wasted not a single motion in his dressing of his kill that is very much in character im not even going to get into the littlefinger scene its been talked to death already it worked for me to whoever said that lancel is dressed like edward from final fantasy lolgif classbbcemoticon altlol  so much truth maybe pycelle can smack him with his walking stick for the full effect altogether for me the episodes are just getting better and better cant wait for the final 3 episodes edited by mya stone 30 may 2011  0836 am"
"Humble Asskicker",2011-05-30,"after all the buildup for the littlefinger brothel scene i was vastly disappointed i was expecting a type of explicit sex scene unprecedented for hbobut it was not i halfexpected to see a woman actually get fingered in the ass or something but the whole thing was lightly simulated it was just another sex scene not particularly shocking either it pales to some of the stuff on spartacus i didnt even find the exposition egregious it expounded on necessary information for those unfamiliar to the books and actually gave littlefinger a history to flesh him out it reminded me of some of swearengens many monologues though less baroque lets see what other scenes received melodramatic outcries of despair and much gnashing of teeth from the obsessives ah the tywin scene apparently because he was never mentioned to have dressed animals he would never do something like hunt or skin what he killed he just sits in his solar all day reading and adjudicating i imagine that sort of sweaty bureaucratic exercise is what keeps him as fit as a man half his age obviously also ghost barking this is another pet peeve for some people in the books ghost never made a peep this was menacing in the books in a live action show a silent ghost would make him seem like a fairly docile animal perhaps something of a halfwit too dogs bark yes wolves bark too if you cant separate your mental image of the books characters to the point that you must absolutely hate another interpretation then i guess thats unfortunate for you but just because you dont like the scene doesnt mean that it isnt a good scene its simply a good scene that you have the misfortune to dislike and ghost barking as the nights watch headed off to the weirwood was a good scene so all in all great stuff made even better by the ever reliable bitching of obsessives i just love seeing their noses tweaked"
"NW Deserter",2011-05-30,"my biggest problem with the lf scene wasnt even the sex itself it was that the moaning was drowning out some of his words it really lessened the dramatic effect of what he was saying as if the director was intentionally trying to get us to watch the sex instead of listen to lf jmo i guess"

"Kaitscralt",2011-05-30,"agree with the humble asskickers post basically 100 after reading a weeks worth of people complaining i was expecting to see some of the worst scenes ever  and they were pretty typical for hbo the only thing that bugged me was how roberts death seemed much more abrupt on the show than in the books maybe renly could have explained more clearly to eddard what happened before he got there still another great episode for me lots of moving stuff including drogos speech and the jorah pardon makes more sense to me now after seeing it assuming that the letter said daenerys is going to be assassinated so you are free to come home makes jorahs staying seem even more epic instead of the poisoned wine being an intentionally failed assassination so that jorah could get closer to daenerys by saving her and varys could remain loyal to both sides this time it looks like a real attempt on daenerys viserys was always the more important one to the targaryen loyalists and nobody knows he is dead yet  daenerys is expendable that jorah realized was going to happen and saved her just in time it worked for me edited by kaitscralt 30 may 2011  0842 am"
"wolverine",2011-05-30,"tywin is skinning the deer he killed i assume because it shows the audience the difference between him and his two true children jaime and cersei they both walk around like lannisters and boss people around liek lannisters yet they arent always willing to do the hard work that is needed he is skinning the deer because he killed the deer and he is going to eat the deer he sees his children as poiled brats living off his legacy and hard work listen to the disdain he has for jaimethis was my favorite of the added scenes and i think it almost perfectly introduces tywin dance rocks even so it is a bit ridiculous that tywin is skinning his own stag on a table for some reason i have probably skinned a 100 deer and would hang every one if possible plus you dont gut an animal like he did and pull out ropes of garland like entrail anyhow that is really nitpicky as very few viewers have proabably ever butchered an animal or seen anything butchered the scene definitely shows that he is not afraid to get dirty and get things donehated the lf whore coaching scene ros is very annoying at this point i would say that i have found lfs portrayal spot on so far thoughjason momoa is khal drogoi thought jorahs actor was too small and old looking but he has done an excellent jobwas theon a pathetic pervert in the bookscouple people have pointed out how bad renlys casting is and how changed he is from the books i agree 100 with this"

"VikingLegion",2011-05-30,"apparently we came away from the books with drastically different ideas of tywins characterstrange isnt it i had no problem seeing him get his hands dirty to me he reads as a mans man who will push to excel in all things  not some paperpushing beaurocratic puppetmaster who refuses to engage in the action if anything i see him as quite the opposite  a man who believes that nobody could possibly ever do the job as well as himself so he will take matters into his own hands when that is appropriate of course when large scale betrayals and other ugly business is involved hell utilize a lesser mind to make sure all the heat falls on his scapegoatsin our world i envision tywin as a highpowered ceo who kicks ass in the board room for most of the day but in his off time hes got black belts in multiple martial arts styles can kick the crap out of men half his age and still have enough energy to go home and do his own oil change on his selfrestored vintage car out in the garage  because he knows some pimply faced kid at the local jiffy lube wont do as good a job as he will hes the millionaire that still brings a bag lunch to work everyday because its the practical thing to domaybe im way off but thats just the tywin i envisioned and why the stag scene resonated perfectly for me good convo though its interesting to me to see how a character can be interpreted so differently i guess none of us will be more right than the others"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-30,"my bad in my original post i said he seemed aged about 5 years and everyone ran with it so i did too im just judging by facial hair lol and robb seems older than 1617 in the show as well ned stark seems to have been aged at least 10 years supposedly 34ish in the book i dont think the aging is acrosstheboard 23 years dany seems to have been aged more than 23 years as well i dont think the show can be held to the same hardcore chronology that the books can jon snow to me looks older than 1617 in the show i believe the actor who plays him is mid20s so whatever age they say jon snow is in the series he looks like a fullgrown man so should not be acting like a child in my eyes at least which is probably why his whininess seems so inappropriate to me in that case its a casting error but since i like the dude playing him and hes easy on the eyes lol ill let it slide smilegif classbbcemoticon alt yes kit harrington was 23 when the show was shot a big part of the actors on the show are older than their characters and it goes for all the children speaking of children i was mainly referring to the stark children when i said they are aged up 23 years dany is aged up 4 years if i recall correctly and you are right in that the people in neds generation are aged up about 10 years as for the chronology i actually did put it in the shows own chronology as 17 years is what the show says while its shorter in the books the remark about jon probably being born after the war was a side thing which is why i put it in parenthesisas for jon being how he is i think it works fine as hes had a chip on his shoulder from being treated unfairly and has never had any chance to step out of that shadow until he joins the watch because cat would never be fine with him getting a decent position at winterfell i think that works just as well in his late teens as people have held grudges on life for far longer than that"
"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-30,"tywin satisfied me he wasnt completely bald which i always thought was a very interesting part of his character  how he doesnt believe in halfmeasures also butchering his own stag was kind of silly the book tywin would have never done such a thing but this tywin seems to be a slightly different character hes still an antagonist powerplayer strategist kingmaker and a man whos respected and feared but he smacks of randyll tarly i enjoyed his and jaimes scene thoughthis isnt directed towards you but a general point on tywin skinning the stag nobles hunt for sport not for food and dressing your kill is part of the hunting game i can definitely see the highborn doing that to their own kills as part of the whole manliness ritual hunting represents for them tywin could very well be one that hunts for the ritualistic sport of it rather than just to kill something like robert as you say tywin doesnt believe in halfmeasures which tells us he wouldnt skip part of the whole hunting experience when he decided to huntas for getting his hands dirty thats more likely figuratively speaking than literary because you dont get to be as fit as tywin seems to be at his age if you arent a person that takes part in a good deal of physical activitiesso to go and say that the book tywin would have never done such a thing is pretty much committing the fallacy of putting forth opinion as fact"
"Steel_Wind",2011-05-30,"they basically did away with cersei offering herself to nedi think this is problematic in many respects they made that choice when they aged up cersei as she is portrayed in the books and decided that they would not cast a bombshell in the role book cersei was a breathtaking babe of a woman that all men lusted after tv cersei is attractive woman to be sure but she is no bombshell when they decided to cast lena headey as cersei they decided that tv cersei would be less sexual in terms of how the character was portrayed on screen i think that has been clear from the outsetlena headey is an attractive woman and i dont at all want to be taken to mean that i dont think she is i repeat she is an attractive woman but she just isnt the kind of woman that is going to make most men forget themselves in the way that grrm wrote the charactertrying to add that milf layer to cersei at this stage with ned in the godswood would have seemed forced and entirely unbelievable they wisely didnt go there imo edited by steelwind 30 may 2011  0641 pm"
"Steel_Wind",2011-05-30,"this isnt directed towards you but a general point on tywin skinning the stag nobles hunt for sport not for food and dressing your kill is part of the hunting game i can definitely see the highborn doing that to their own kills as part of the whole manliness ritual hunting represents for them exactly field dressing a deer is seen as a noblemans task indeed to kill any deer was always a right reserved to the nobility in the middle and late medieval periods being caught at stealing a deer from a noblemans forest was a crime invariably punishable by deathin contrast slaughtering and skinning a domestiacted animal like a pig sheep goat or cow would defnitely be a peasants task and would be beneath a man like tywin lannisterit is a distinction with a difference"

"legba11",2011-05-30,"tywin is not in the middle of a war yet he is preparing for one as he is the type of leader who sees these things coming he is sending part of his host with jaime to start a war chances are he and many of his fellow nobles were quite bored just sitting around waiting for other bannermen to arrive hunting for the sake of food and morale is likely one of the most important things they could do its not like they had strategy to plan yet"

"Rockroi",2011-05-31,"i think in the context of the scene anyway renly was implying to just get rid of the queen and joffrey anyway never mind successionmaybe that was his point but he never states that nor even implies it prior to ned bringing up stannis in fact it seems quite the opposite that renly is saying exactly what he wants to accomplish lets strike now hold the king and keep power for ourselves why mention stannis at that point if the whole point is to rule through joff thatâ<U+0092>s my problem why does ned mention stannis when nobody is discussing the line of succession why bring up stannis at all it gets even more curious once stannis is out in the open renly starts on this bizarre rant about how this is not time to talk about the line of succession and how he would make a good king who the hell even mentioned usurping the throne the whole context of the discussion was keeping joff on the throne it actually makes no sense 1 renly knows lets face it if ned can figure something immoral and devious out likely a good bunch of other people have figured it out before him ned is not exactly sherlock holmes its not unreasonable to think renly would sit on this knowledge if he thought robert would not believe him and take out his anger on him ever have a friend whos gfbf was cheating on them and everyone knew it but your friendcompletely agree that its possible that renly knows the problem with this theory is that does not excuse ned bringing up stannis what renly knows and does not know is immaterial to ned bringing up stannis if renly knows its not up to ned to assume renly knows if renly knows renly should say as much he never does i reject the idea that ned would assume somebody would know this yes a few scenes later ned tells lf but that just furthers my point ned tells lf he does not assume lf knows he assuredly did but thatâ<U+0092>s the whole point same with renly it would be insane for ned to say to renly in this context â<U+0096> â<U+0093>hey renly old chap your brother is dying hold that thought and you want to take joff and hold him over the lannistersâ<U+0085> but i will assume by all this that you know that robert has no true heirs and start discussing stannisâ<U+0094> makes no sense at all finally try to recall the timeline robert is still alive at this point of all the people not to tell at this moment renly is 1 he could easily go in and try to revive robert and make him do something and this ned wants to avoid like the plague 2 renly clearly does overburden himself with proper sucession he has no right to the throne yet he is conspiring with the most honorable man in westeros to take it he sees himself as the best candidate and he may be right and that makes him a valid king does anyone who did not carry joffery in her womb think joffery will make a good king his uncles and grandfather all talk about what a monster he is honorable jaime sets getting tommen free of cerseis claws before he becomes joffery2 as his priority at the end of affcagain i am not saying you are wrong but thatâ<U+0092>s not what renly says nor implies and its not a reasonable product of the discussion to that point renly is completely clear he wants to get joff away from cersei and begin ruling through joff if that is the case than there is no reason to discuss stannis or lines of succession because the king will be joff ned not renly is the one who starts talking about stannis its only after ned brings up stannis that anyone mentions lines of succession and that makes no sense because nobody is talking about succeeding robert joff is the placeholder nobody disagrees his actual idea in the books as well if i recall was to seize all three lannister children and basically hold them hostageexile themsomething bad even though he thought they were baratheons presumablyirrelevant at no point is renly discussing in the book about declaring himself king he is always discussing rule through joff from the booklord renly glanced warily at ser boros on the far end of the span at ser preston in the doorway behind them â<U+0093>that letterâ<U+0094> he leaned close â<U+0093>was it the regency has my brother named you protectorâ<U+0094> he did not wait for a reply â<U+0093>my lord i have thirty men in my personal guard and other friends beside knights and lords give me an hour and i can put a hundred swords in your handâ<U+0094> â<U+0093>and what should i do with a hundred swords my lordâ<U+0094> â<U+0093>strike now while the castle sleepsâ<U+0094> renly looked back at ser boros again and dropped his voice to an urgent whisper â<U+0093>we must get joffrey away from his mother and take him in hand protector or no the man who holds the king holds the kingdom we should seize myrcella and tommen as well once we have her children cersei will not dare oppose us the council will confirm you as lord protector and make joffrey your wardâ<U+0094> ned regarded him coldly â<U+0093>robert is not dead yet the gods may spare him if not i shall convene the council to hear his final words and consider the matter of the succession but i will not dishonor his last hours on earth by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their bedsâ<U+0094> lord renly took a step back taut as a bowstring â<U+0093>every moment you delay gives cersei another moment to prepare by the time robert dies it may be too late    for both of usâ<U+0094> â<U+0093>then we should pray that robert does not dieâ<U+0094> â<U+0093>small chance of thatâ<U+0094> said renly â<U+0093>sometimes the gods are mercifulâ<U+0094> â<U+0093>the lannisters are notâ<U+0094> martin george rr 2003 a game of thronesa clash of kings kindle locations 82318244 bantam kindle editionthere is nothing about doing anything but ruling through joff if this is the case why even discuss stannis renly is doinga powergrab but is only discussing ruling through joff in the books and in the show in the book ned never mentions stannis and for good reason its nonsensical stannis has not discussed revolting the line of succession is clear the only spoilpoint is who is the regent ned or cersei that is the sticking point same is true in the show only now ned mentions stannis here is my theory its poor writing to make up for prior poor writing they waited way way way way too long to mention stannis in the first few episodes so they now have to find poor excuses to explain who stannis is and why he would be a bad king and even this is pathetic they make satnnis sound like heâ<U+0092>s aerys targaryen reborn hence they have to drop him into a scene where he has no business being itâ<U+0092>s a huge error because ned would never say this to renly and because they need to establish stannis as a character now because they took too long earlier itâ<U+0092>s a small thing but it irks me nonetheless"

"The Knight of Grasses",2011-05-31,"my least favorite episode so far most of that has to do with the terrible lfrozrandom moaning whore scene im not a huge fan of the nudity in general but this is hbo so im willing to put up with it as long as it has a purpose either directly like the cerseijaime sex scene or indirectly to develop a character like tyrion or viserys the dothraki stuff is marginal but its pretty tame this scene with the two women was way over the top and detracted from the actual point of the scene which was lfs diatribe about his feelings on the starks and i disliked the diatribe itself  why the heck is lf telling all this to women who work in his brothel i said this after last weeks episode i dont care for what theyre doing to his character hes not nearly the sly cunning charmer that hes supposed to be  hes just an asshole i also disliked the tywin scene tywin lannister butchering his own kill tywin lannister hunting in the first place yes hes a bad ass but i think they could have shown that in another way again the visuals detracted from the point of the scene in my opinion the actual dialogue with jaime was fine third the theonosha scene was just meh theyre really hammering theons exile from the iron islands and his position as a kind of prisoner of the starks i think it will eventually pay off but right now it feels like a bit too much whats sad is that the rest of the episode seemed really good but those three scenes were at the beginning and soured me for the remainder i will have to go back and watch it again i might appreciate it more on a second viewing"

"smegma",2011-05-31,"i noticed what rockroi is saying upon my third viewing  i thought i might be looking too far into the dialog but it just didnt make sense to me i think it is an error but i doubt 99 of the people watching will be confused by it and just take it without a second thought i figured it was a either the dialog was supposed to be longer but a few lines were cut either in editing or in the shoot and the context was altered as a result or b they decided they needed to mention stannis again to drill home to the viewer that is who ned is supporting and why renly thinks he is unfit but by inserting him in there they didnt consider the continuity problem like i said though probably not a huge deal to even most readerfans"

"SnowBastard",2011-05-31,"this was a great episode lots of people bashing on the lf scenehmmm the moans i agree were a bit too loud and took just a little away from his monologue but the monologue was fantastic the actor who plays him portrays him exceptionally well in my opinion hes a ruthless piece of shit and he sounds monotonous because he doesnt care about anyone enough to bring emotion if he was an emotional wreck he wouldnt be lf funny enough this is the exact way i pictured and heard him while reading the books cons i dont think mark addy hit the mark on the death bed  he came out sounding strained rather than dying the presence of ros baffles me to no end maester aemon just doesnt feel right i think aemon and renly have been the only snags the casting thus far as just mentioned i simply am not believing anything renly does the actor has not sold me on anything  hard to imagine him pulling off the peach scene next season pros drogo drogo drogo i cant say enough about jason mamoas silent but amazing performance his rage and love for dany was shown here finally throughout the episode beautiful acting drogo is the exact same as i saw him in the book jorah and dany have great chemistry their scenes are always good the godswood scene at the wall was superb the betrayal of ned stark with lf to end the episode was a highlight for me the look of absolute frustration on the face of ned before the shot was cut to credits was just another testament of sean beans powerful acting ability tywin and jaime had the best scene in the entire episode hands down nikolaj is jaime effin lannister and dance is tywin lannister end of discussion neutral theon and osha were totally bailed out by luwin to save the scene not really digging oshas character as much as the book theon gets a pass anxiously anticipating the next episode as i think it will properly set up the most insane plot twist in moviebookshow history i remember reading it for the first time ever and re reading it for the next hour again and again to make sure that it happened i hope that non readers will feel the exact same way"

"Steel_Wind",2011-05-31,"illyrio explains this in part to us they never bet on daenerys initially she was simply the price of the dothraki the bet was always on viserys the assassination order for daenerys was given at a time when viserys was to the knowledge of varys still alive varys also hedged his bets by making sure mormont knew about the order mormont was not given a pardon in the book so that he would stay continue to provide intelligence and interfere with the attempt there was a very good chance that mormont would foil it the poisoned wine was selected as a weapon which was relatively easy for mormont to intercept if he didnt with viserys alive and the khal short a wife and unborn son it was hoped that khal drogos pride and rage would then cause the dothraki to invade  and viserys takes the throne if she survived the assassination attempt  same resultthe granting of the pardon to mormont in the tv series is a significant departure from the books i believe it is dd trying to simplify matters for the audience  but is also dd hedging their bets so that mormont could be allowed to stay on with dany in asos if the series needs him to barristan cut for budget reasons actor cant be resigned passes away etcin any event viserys died  and to paraphrase illyrio so did dany the empty child she was drowned in the dothraki sea what emerged from the dothraki sea was someone  and something  mostly unexpectedthe above is the easy explanation the more unlikely and more complex one is that varys is in league with the house of black and white and he may be though is not necessarily a full priest and even a faceless man there is a scene in the house of black and white where arya attends a meeting on level 2 of the temple and one of the attendees could easily fit a description of varys if so varys longterm motivations are accordingly both inscrutable and informed by prophecy again if so in addition to mormont as insurance varys also bet that dany would survive the attempt because of the prophecy edited by steelwind 31 may 2011  0828 pm"
"Whoring Drunkard",2011-06-01,"maybe that was his point but he never states that nor even implies it prior to ned bringing up stannis in fact it seems quite the opposite that renly is saying exactly what he wants to accomplish lets strike now hold the king and keep power for ourselves why mention stannis at that point if the whole point is to rule through joff thatâ<U+0092>s my problem why does ned mention stannis when nobody is discussing the line of succession why bring up stannis at all it gets even more curious once stannis is out in the open renly starts on this bizarre rant about how this is not time to talk about the line of succession and how he would make a good king who the hell even mentioned usurping the throne the whole context of the discussion was keeping joff on the throne it actually makes no sense hmm thats not quite how i took the scene its clearly a change from the books in that tv renly tries to sell poorly ned on backing him as king so tv renly is not talking about keeping joff on the throne tv renly was in fact talking about seizing joff and installing another king because whoever controls the rightful king has the power to install whomever he wants as the king tv ned plays along with this premise and says in effect that in that case if its not joff it still wouldnt be you it would be stannis"

"theMountainGoat",2011-06-01,"i think my biggest problem with this episode is what it did not include and its a very small innocuous scene  ned having breakfast with arya and sansa on the morning right before he learns robert is dead ned tells them their ship leaves later that day and he wants them packed and ready to go arya says she has already packed and can she have one last lesson with syrio before they go after this sansa still upset about being made to leave runs off and runs away from the septa takes place off screen and i agree with those who said we should not have seen her go to cersei because that would tip off the surprise a little but surely we should have at least seen her run off this scene is important because it establishes why the girls are still in the city and where they are and what they are doing when the shit hits the fan many tv viewers think the girls are gone well on their way back to winterfell because in the world of tv if you say they are being sent home one week and then you dont show them in the episode the next week they are effectively gone how are they going to explain this in episode 8 will we rewind time to before neds arrest a caption saying one hour earlier perhaps which would really take me out of the flow of the show or maybe just jump straight into aryas scene with syrio and expect the audience to catch up to what is going on without any explanation at all also when arya goes to the stables and finds her bags there pulls out needle and uses the pointy end on the stable boy is it going to make sense why her bags are there is she going to say ah my bags are here from when i packed them earlier i hope my sword is still here which would be clumsy exposition perhaps she will just have needle with her when she is training with syrio or she will retrieve it from her room in the tower of the hand instead lots of ways round it but i can see it being confusing if that scene does play out as described in the book and there is no explanation given even more worrying is the suggestion someone made that perhaps sansa did not tip off cersei about neds plans which be a significant change from the book events plausible enough that cersei could figure it out without sansas help but will this be what we are complaining about next week and with george having written episode 8 will we still complain that the details are different"

"Lady Blackfish",2011-06-02,"i liked the tywin and jaime scene overall at the beginning of the season i was most excited about the casting of the lannister men and so far that is panning out granted dances tywin came off as a little more demonstrative with his pride and condescension than i imagined but overall there was a lot to like in that scene i feel like this show very clearly gets and enjoys some characters more than others and i think the lannisters tend to be on the advantageous side of that preference i could tolerate the blatant obviousness of the stag symbolism because of how well the actors played off each other it was interesting how they solidly characterized tywins retaliation as a dynastic power play this early on its debatable and ambiguous in the book i liked cerseis talk with ned well enough although im still not sure if i like this cersei who worshiped robert once is she now going to be head over heels for both robert and rhaegar i liked headeys delivery of her your sister was a corpse line while at the same time i missed the books more fiery and exuding cersei more than ever in this scene the brothel scene with littlefinger and the whores was terrible and absurd and i hated it im really enjoying sumpter so much as luwin and think that the wall arc with jon and sam is another thing hbo is doing uniformly well mind you i also think thats one of the easier storylines to get right its pretty simplistic and archetypal compared to what else is going on i thought roberts death was a bit anticlimactic but not bad i wished we could see the moment of his death also ned has really pretty penmanship thirding the love for iain glenn i always found jorah very interesting in the books and im glad glenn is making me as interested as him in the show still need to think more about the changes to renly i think i dont mind us seeing more doubts in him as we saw previously and i actually disagree that he was only ever roberts blustery side he had roberts swagger but in a more moderate dose even though humility was never his strong suit and i can see seeds of his character as presented in the show there in the book renly was never a soldier the book points out that he was only ever a passing fighter but he had power of charisma as well as a suitable enough sense of duty and fairmindedness he was not without cleverness and while he had a certain carelessness about him i found it believable that in time he could grow up to be a pretty good king the shows renly seems to be the voice of antimachoness and while i can see why it bothers some people or strikes them as out of character i cant mind it too much because damn i really like this renly i want to be his best friend after the way he chewed robert out in the last episode eta oh i forgot to mention i think the show did ned a disservice by not emphasizing the massacre of rhaegars children before the end of this episode i think it wouldve made neds choice more sympathetic if still politically unwise most people seem to be having a hairrippingout experience with ned in this episode while i think it wouldve better served his character if we could at least understand that his honor is from a certain perspective understandable and not totally removed from reality children torn screaming from their beds is no small thing and neds choice wouldve seemed more difficult instead of so obviously dumb edited by lady blackfish 02 june 2011  0417 am"

"Tywin's bastard",2011-06-02,"lack of jon pleading for sam wasnât bad just becouse of understanding of samâs story on the wall but also becouse i think aemon needs more screen timethat part would also make viewers ask why sam wasnt considered for such an assignment in the first place though the nights watch is a shadow of what it should be but its not because the leaders are incompetent enough to put a very physically ungifted and mentally weak person in the rangers or something like that it should be natural to put him with the maester in the kitchens or something like thatbtw i am curious if martin will give us some info dumps about rheagarâs children or stannis we seriously need itwell see but i doubt it rhaegars children and wife arent very important in the first two seasons id put in more information about rhaegar himself before his family and we didnt get too much information about stannis in the book either they might talk about what hes doing a bit but i expect most of the info about him coming in the next season as the last three episodes should be quite packed with events"

"AndyC",2011-06-04,"well first post from me  main points of discussion seem to be the two scenes that were the significantly new ones tywin  jaime  the stag and gratuitous ros and the soft porn exposition the tywin scene i liked a lot with the possible caveat that jaimes hair seemed darker than ever i dont like to quibble for the sake of it but as the hair colour issue is a highly significant plot point on hair colour id never see joffrey as being jaimes son in the tv show it does grate somewhat that said i love the actors portrayal of jaime and i think hes got the character absolutely spot on cocky and arrogant but with some insecurity and lingering almost hidden desire to be understood as not dishonourable just invest in some hair dye and hell be perfect i can really see dance as tywin  excellent casting the brothel scene though almost ruined the entire show it was five minutes long of girlongirl action and now play with her arse seeing as my 17yearold daughter was watching with us to say we were cringing is an understatement its the scene thats put me off ever recommending the show to any friends or family  id hate to envisage their reaction if they tuned in to what seems to be a softporn show especially if they turned off in embarassment within the first five minutes the irritant is heightened by the amount of precious screen time it consumes when you think of what else had to be sliced out to allow the extra interminable minutes of ros writhing and moaning and a personal lack of belief that it achieves anything positive to make up for it consider there are three potential reactions to the scene   arousal and interest people falling into this category are paying close attention to the sex and probably mentally tuning out the stuff that littlefinger is saying you dont watch porn for the plot after all  taking it in their stride with no real reaction theyll have taken the plot exposition on board but would have done so in a nonsexposition exposition as well  embarasseduncomfortable will tune out as much as possible until its over at the end of the episode my daughter was surprised at littlefingers betrayal and asked us why and we explained  and mentioned the brothel scene she said oh i was checking my facebook during that bit tis annoying really that said much of the rest of the episode was good the nights watch oath im not too fussed about the truncation of it was good i think the entire feel of the wall and castle black is spot on bleak tired rundown the confrontation in the garden with cersei yes it should have been the godswood and cerseis seductive offers in the books didnt come across but i understand why they didnt do that and dont think that the loss of the godwood is a big quibble the dying robert the conversation with littlefinger was great and the throne room scene was spot on i wasnt quite so enamoured with the renly scene to be fair  i didnt like renly trying to usurp the throne with no knowledge of the joffreyjaime situation however im looking forward to episode 8 and hope that the extra gratuitous sex will be toned down i wanted game of thrones not dany does dragonstone sequels dany does duskendale dany does dorne with dany does the dreadfort to be published imminently"

"Bronn Stone",2011-05-31,"i think it would be really cool if at some point sam finds an old copy of the oath and they learn it used to be longer that the oath itself becomes one of the the things mormont laments that the watch has forgotten not bloody likely but it would be a great plot point and much better than just establishing theyve forgotten how to kill wights with fire and others with obsidian"

"reiver",2011-06-01,"i know its super cool to bash people complaining about changes and dismiss their opinions as somehow unenlightened and obsessive but i think grrms books are so delicately balanced that every change worries me the core story is good but its the little things that make it great the innocuous words or actions that serve as foreshadowing the way you can be suprised by an outcome but look back and see the path to it out in the open the way that characters and their motivations are kept ambiguous and your opinion of them constantly shifts as theyre delayered the tv show has lost so much of that by laying things bare or skipping lines or whole scenes it may be a lot of seemingly innocuous things bit for me it makes the show considerably weaker as mentioned its not as simple as sacrificing depth for accessibility adding a few lines in may be utterly meaningless at the time but when future events happen people get a kick out of seeing the meaning in things and it makes rewatches rewarding iff you can recognise portntous lines"

"Greylander",2011-05-29,"my thoughts although i liked the whole doublemeaning thing and the insight into petyrs motivation i think there are two problems with this scene 1 for the viewer who is paynig attention it gives away his later betrayal my nonreader girlfriend says she saw the throne room coming simply because of how littlefinger said he wanted to fuck them and the main target of them was clearly ned the scene or a slightly modified version of it should have come after the throne room betrayal so probably in episode 8 2 valuable screen time every second counts and they only have so much many people miss the jon suggesting sam as assistant to maester aemon plotline and i agree you could trade 100 out of 360 seconds spent on littlefingers monologue in order to have the jonsam plot not just for its own sake but also so the whole jontostewardsnotrangers is set up better instead of outoftheblue at the moment of graduation there are probably other areas where some of that valuable screen time could have been spent however i do not think this is a problem that littlefinger confided his feelings in his employees yes to be strict he probably would not be so careless candid about his motivesintentions to anyone but a certain amount of dramatic license has to be used for this sort of thing if you want to reveal some of what a character is thinkingfeeling the same applies to the littlefingervaryis scene in an earlier episode although the books do not provide a littlefinger pov they provide a lot of information about his connection to catelyn and nonreaders need to get that connection"

"SpaA<U+009F>vogel",2011-05-30,"i think the main problem with it is that it is too on the nose littlefinger has already telegraphed that hes a slimy shit in the tv show without the removal of all subtlety i mean even in the fourth book i still feel like im just seeing the bare outline of his game but this gives away his primary motivation something thats still mysterious in the books even aside of him trying to teach the prostitutes how to receive a john a scene as gratuitous as the lorasrenly scene which was equally destructive of a subtle thread in the books his motivations become very plain the moment he lies right to neds face before the throneroom confrontation and puts a knife on his neck after itwhy spend all that time explaining it we only have 10 precious hours in this series to explain the book and it just seems that there was plenty of room for some of the excised subplots that are taken up with redundant sexposition how many times do we need theon explained for example shrug hopefully we get extended cuts on dvd that spread the stuff out more"
"julandro",2011-05-30,"this is incredible nobody is going to complain about the lesbian scene i do not want to imagine if they had done with renly and loras"
"Anomandaris86",2011-05-30,"if this gets its own thread than i might as well copypaste my thoughts about it from the main threadtheres one very important comment in that lesbian scene littlefinger says hes saving himself for another can this be another area where the tv show is spoiling something in the books for us originally i thought while reading that littlefinger might be scheming to make himself warden of the north and end up marrying catelyn after all but then the red wedding happened and he didnt seem all that disturbed by it in fact when sansa tells him to give harrenhall to lord frey in book 4 he simply laughs and says maybe i will hardly the attitude of a grieving man but now with his comment in that scene it seems that maybe he really did plan on marrying catelyn or was he talking about sansa or someone else entirelythoughts he also could be referring to lysa as someone pointed out except that after making that comment he then starts talking immediately about catelyn"
"NW Deserter",2011-05-30,"i think the biggest thing they couldve done it improve this scene is to make sure the focus is on lf through some tweaking with the audio the sex itself wasnt terribly distractingboth chicks were hot but the sex was tame compared to some of the stuff you can find on the internet the bigger problem was that they were literally moaning over and louder than some of lfs monologue if they had just toned it down and magnified what lf was saying at least when he was talking about brandon it wouldve made the scene 10x better"
"Mad Queen",2011-05-30,"i thought it was lysa btw ridiculous scene and bad metaphor too"
"wolverine",2011-05-30,"the scene was extremely ridiculous imo even the thought that lf is saving himself for catelyn is ridiculous i am pretty sure he only treats lysa and her insanity as a path to power no real feelings there"
"Kaitscralt",2011-05-30,"i thought it was a bit much but after reading the reactions of people who watched the episode a week early i thought it was going to be a lot worse it wasnt unbearable and i dont think it gave away much"

"QueenOfThorns",2011-05-30,"maybe i am a complete dunce but it didnt dawn on me that littlefinger wanted it all until somewhere in book four and i read the series twice so far lol i always thought that he just wanted to get as high as he could but never thought that he aspired to the throne giving it away this early is not cool in my book i like characters that take a while to figure out"
"Steel_Wind",2011-05-30,"my complaint with the scene taken cumulatively with the earlier scenes in the brothel is that nonreaders have now been introduced to littlefinger as the pimp and he will be remembered that way by viewers in subsequent episodes and seasonsin the books lord baelish had an interest in some brothels yes but those were just a few investments among many he wasnt a pimp he was simply an urban capitalist who as the lord of rocks and sheepshit understood that being good at urban commerce was necessary for a man in his position given his poor lands and rentsso as opposed to portraying littlefinger as an affable clever duplicitous lord who will engage in urban commerce in a manner which the vast majority of lords with lands and titles believe is beneath a true nobleman littlefinger is protrayed in the tv series as the pimp instead of the lord of rocks and sheepshit  we get the lord of whores that makes him less admirable less gray and more outright villainous to the viewer thats the part i didnt like never mind play with her ass they made littlefinger less complex less gray  and in doing so changed the character i dont think thats a plus"

"El Phatso",2011-05-30,"agree with steel wind completely the book portrays lf as someone who is subtle and in control  a master of puppets he always has a mysterious aura about him this scene portrays him as someone who is desperate angry and is on the verge of losing his cool all subtelty is wiped away as he lays his cards on the table for all to see"

"Silverjaime",2011-05-30,"quote namesteelwind timestamp1306780691 post2497204i disagree let me explain why i think littlefingers training exercise is a stealthy bit of context and actually is meant to be a very important scene a poster on wic made the observation last monday that the real utility of the scene is not readily obvious the real point is not to show littlefinger is a pimp though that is the inevitable byproduct and why i didnt like it but to set the viewer up for what is really going on with tyrion and shae and how tyrion allows himself to be deceived we are about to meet shae in episode 8 or 9 her interaction with tyrion and the fact that she is faking it on an expert level is explicitly underscored to the viewer in this scene it is meant to add the underlying unspoken reality to tyrion and shaes entire relationship that aspect of the whore training scenes importance to the series is very hard to appreciate prospectively but once shae has been introduced  it frames all of her scenes with tyrion from book 1 to 3 we are not supposed to forget it  but we are told why tyrion tries very hard to do soi dont think its readily obvious to most people that this scene is foreshadowing tyrions relationship with shae  and nor does it need to its fairly understood by all that the whores are pretending pleasure as shae will with tyrion that he chooses not to see it is his own little fantasythe allegory between what lf is saying about fucking people over and what the whores are doing is of course obvious to me however i dont have to like how its portrayed in such detail or at such length considering the numerous other ways this could have been conveyed and the time constraints within which to tell the story the other sexposition scenes ive had no problem with but the sex in this scene was imho both gratuitous and tackyand it reinforces the previouslydepicted view of littlefinger as nothing but a pimp  one with delusions of grandeur and huge ambition  but still a pimp which is not how the character appeared in the books"
"Ellroy",2011-05-30,"worst scene of the series so far and really out of charachter for lf"
"Lord Mord",2011-05-30,"wow pretty much everything said here against the scene i already agreed with its on the nose yes and it ungrays the character im less concerned about why lf would confide in employees though for him in particular that seems odd than i am with the sheer fact of his having any contact with employees down at this level in the first placewhen lf opened his first few brothels okay maybe but the guy now has a whole tax edifice to say nothing of a massive minting operation to run books to keep for a whole government and probably he has dozens of brothels and lord knows whatever other unsavory businesses besides but he has time to break in and train a couple of new whores by himself when he must have several regular managers and senior staff besides i just thought the scene was sloppy in concept and execution the performers did everything they could with it the direction was okay but the writing was all over the placeand you knowi dont think we wanted this story yet and for sure as hell not from lf himself what is this story about is it about sympathy for lf thats ruined when you have the boy himself sniveling about it as an adult so many years later when i read it in the novel i seem to recall its purpose was a fakeout leading me to think that lf had his own kind of honor  i love this woman so much i nearly died for her so if she asks me to help you much as it galls me ill do it entirely faithfully does it serve that purpose in the series hardly  the image we get instead is of the guy whos only biding his timeand thats not the worst part of it the exposition is so long and requires such a steady delivery  and also struggles so much for attention against the sexo stuff  i fear that people who dont know what the story is about wont know whats being said and anyone who listens long enough to get even part of it will tune out the rest when it doesnt seem immediately relevant or likely to change whats happening in this scenethats about as far as i want to go with this though i like the series theres still a whole lot of strong points and quibbling just upsets my stomach but  yes this scene has some problems"
"Alcarin",2011-05-30,"i really do not understand people here complaining about this scene that much the point is ofcourse it is obvious to us who read the books we know what lf does and saying that analogy ofcourse we say omg baaam connected everything this will happen i watched with 4 friends and noone thought of lf betraying ned also about he shouldnt be telling what he wants to a whore would a whore today or even some random guy you talk in a bar believe if you told him i want everything whole world with an evil grin or would he just thought oh another crazy delusional person you guys read into this way too much the whores just think he is joking with them alot or majority of book readers will and did not connect the dots but got a big deja vu and btw i love aidan gillens portrayal of littlefinger one of the best casting choices"
"Excellency",2011-06-02,"did anyone else think the scene where littlefinger is instructing ros and her friend on how to be better whores was unnecessary and strange it did accomplish a couple of things expositionwise we learned that ros has reached littlefinger and now westeros favorite whore is now working in kings landings apparently only whorehouse we also learned that littlefinger is bitter about his childhood his relationship with catelyn and wants to f his enemies but in the process were treated to some girlongirl action more fitting for caligula i mean when i first heard that got was coming to hbo i wondered how bold they would be with some of the sex scenes but i never imagined they would up the ante and go overboard with it it seems out of character for littlefinger to so willingly reveal his innermost thoughts and feelings villianous monologue style and since when does he waste his time auditioning whores and why has the show commited so much screen time to build up ros into a main character i thought maybe when she left for kings landing she might end up replacing the shae character in season two but im told they are casting a shae"

"Abolesco",2011-05-23,"anybody notice that cersei doesnt mention the baratheon child she supposedly had with robert that she told catelyn about i wonder if theyll mention that in some way down the line if it was true or not primarily another thing in that scene as i recall wasnt cersei idolizing rhaegar in the books as opposed to robert her formerly great love of robert feels a bit odd in the scene though it has been some time since i last read that particular scene in agot also did i imagine jorah calling dany by his old wifes name good stuff great episode edit i was also glad to see more talking about stannis since for the first bunch of episodes he seemed to be swept under the rug for the most part edited by kinvalar 23 may 2011  0159 am"

"Winterfelled",2011-05-23,"great episode as usual drogos promise was awesome and really fleshed out his character so far weve seen him grow from a brooding horselord to a caring husband and now to a vengeful warrior considering how little actual screen time he gets his growth has been the shows greatest accomplishment thusfar on the whole i think the dothraki scenes have outshone the westerosi ones though both sides have been fantastic ned was frustrating as always but only in retrospect reading the books i saw him as noble and righteous and assumed he would be the eventual inevitable victor and i assume the viewers who are new to the series feel the same way it will come as a great shock to them when he is killed i loved that we saw tywin field dressing his own kill yes of course they could have shown him at his papers or brooding over a map or something but that would have been too cliche even if thats how we met him in the books though i admit i dont remember how he came on stage in the books this was a unique introduction as well as a very nice metaphor going to miss mark addy i never found robert to be a terribly deep character since hes already reached the end of his proverbial rope by the time he comes to winterfell but mark gave him a soul and cast a sympathetic light on his selfdestructive behavior arya continues to steal the show she might be the finest actor cast when syrio thwacks her with the sword she swallows her words and the pain and i swear to god i felt it when someone can let a swallow and a silence speak for themthats just about as good as it gets isnt it sam is the other scenestealer not much happened up at the wall aside from the oaths and ghost finding the hand but sam really puts a lot of character into his brief appearances sucks we have to wait two weeks now but im used to it we all are i think"
"Sad King Billy",2011-05-23,"oh littlefinger how much do i love to hate you one thing i wonder though will the intro now show the lion sigil in kings landing speaking of the intro one thing annoys me when the camera pans back from winterfell to kings landing then it moves to the dothraki wastes it first shows us vaes dothrak on an angle on the left hand side of the screen then suddenly we jumpcut 180â and its on the righthand side for some reason it always annoys me im also starting to dislike the expositionwithboobs style the series is taking this episode we had littlefinger and his merry women the previously weve had viserys and his slave in bath and theon with his whore renlys shaving scene no boobs for the sake of variety its starting to get repetitive and they just dont do it for me this is the first time ive seen renly and not felt annoyed with his portrayal hope the trend continues"
"Arrogant Bastard",2011-05-23,"my favorite episode of the series so far surprised tyrion wasnt in it my guess is theyre holding him off so his story about tysha is in the same episode he meets up with tywin this one felt the most faithful to the books almost every scene seemed like it was lifted right of the page in terms of action it was actually slower than the last two episodes but the hour still zoomed by and some really phenomenal acting all around the parts on the wall were great the guy who plays samwell is doing a fantastic job and maester aemon seemed much more in character than the somewhat grumpy one in episode 3 great foreboding last shot with ghost and the hand to set up the next episode the show also did a good job of setting up stannis for next seasoni wonder if neds letter will reach dragonstone and that will be how stannis knows of the incest as they have not indicated yet how he was also investigating with jon arryn aidan gillen is really impressing me as littlefinger i thought he was flat in episode 3 but ever since then hes been perfect i liked his long monologue though the lesbian action was probably too over the top and veering into porn territory even though it was another scene of backstory involving sex littlefingers ranting felt organic and not as clunky as others somewhat reminiscent of al swearengens soliloquies in deadwood when hes being serviced by his prostitutes it wasnt that subtle but it was fun seeing how his instructions to the whores parallel his own methods also his scene with ned in the hands office was very well done really enjoyed the way he spins the dagger to point at himself just like in the book the osha theon scene was very well done gives insight into the wildings view on westerosi norms and shows how theon sort of realizes hes not nearly as important as he thinks he is definitely the best segment involving dany in any episode loved drogos big speech and the wine tasting scene wasnt rushed at all up until now and last episode drogo hasnt really done anything now he seems like a legitimate part of the show the one scene that didnt click for me as much was ned meeting cersei in the godswood happened kind of abruptly and cersei doesnt come across as spiteful enough though the title line was delivered well finally the last scene was in my opinion the best single scene of the show so far enormous amount of tension even though i knew what was going to happen loved how the camera lingered on the hound with his helm on while it was panning the lannister guards the kid playing joffrey is also very good its going to be a long two weeks for episode eight"

"gbellinator",2011-05-23,"i noticed that too kinda sad makes me wonder if they threw that line in for all the bitching fans did about cats casting i dont think book littlefinger would ever say that of cati dont think littlefinger was talking about cat at that point i think he was referring to lyssait is a bit misleading i think i think he changes topics after her question of marriage"
"Ser Aardvark",2011-05-23,"i have to file tywin under the category where characters are different than their description in the book lysa syrio but whose physical appearance isnt a key part of their character tyrion sam the clegane brothers so much as the way the present themselves it doesnt matter that lysa is fat syrio is bald and tywin is large and broad shouldered the important thing is that the audience understands that lysa is a complete fruit loop syrio is flamboyant skilled with the sword but wise and that tywin is a hard man who puts the interests of his house above all other concerns i have to say in this case they did a damn good job of getting that across"
"gbellinator",2011-05-23,"new lannister motto a lannister always butchers his own meatgreat episode except for the scene with littlefinger ros and her coworker i could hardly stand to watch it it just didnt feel right nice background info dump on lf but really i never imagined him as being quite so hands on in the brothels he ownsi agree i am no prude but hated this scene think of all the cool things from the book that we could have had and instead we get play with her assi could just turn on skinamax or showmetime for that i love the books and i like the series but cmon treat us with intelligence here"
"Kalbear",2011-05-23,"oh dont get me wrong  i love the casting of tywin i dont care about him being bald he looks like a strong scary guy thats all that matters but the butchering seemed a really weird choice for blocking in that episode or in general one of the things we see tywin doing always is studying studying maps discussing with his counsellors reading books talking to troops etc the notion that as he goes to war hed be all hey lets go hunting seems so bizarre to me thats something robert would do tywin takes it way too seriously to allow for something like that i liked the scene and his conversation with jaime  its nice to see that hes disappointed with all his kids and why but the deer got in the wayalso tywin wouldnt have field stripped the thing seriously"
"Abaddon",2011-05-23,"by the time i got to watch ep 6 last night it was late so i put off watching ep 7 until this morning looks like it was probably for the best as i had no problems watching it at all i havent even commented in the ep 6 thread yet so im going to keep this short and will probably post my impressions next week in the real thread after rewatching in hd on tv other than the porntastic sexposition scene which was just embarassing this was the best episode yet brilliant stuff and i cant think of another scene i didnt like which is a first the action has really amped up everywhere and the next three episodes are going to be amazing im not really bummed about having to wait two weeks for ep 8 as we have two episodes to rewatch in the meantime"
"SerArthurHeath",2011-05-23,"this was soooooooooooooo good watched them back to back and cant remember which was which but even characters that seemed a little off before like maybe renly were excellent he may have been a bit of a wuss in his scene with loras but he showed guts here plus we saw that there are more than 2 kg"
"Trebla",2011-05-23,"my dads reaction this morning was dany is a strong woman emilia clarke has hit it out of the park the last two episodes she is starting tgo show that commanding presence that book dany gets her facial expressions when viserys gets crowned and with the wineseller i echo whomever said who cares if her eyes arent purple they are beautiful they are and she emotes wonderfully with them arya does indeed steal every scene her reactions to sansas blathering was priceless even ned stopped briefly to be amused by her maise williams is going to be a rock for this series as she gets even more and more screen time next season and hopefully in season 3"
"Rockroi",2011-05-23,"win or die maybe the best episode of the season and for very good reasons what i liked1 tywin lannisterruler of the seven kingdoms apart from a hamhanded metaphor see below i thought that they just hit tywin out of the park not only does he have a keen sense of the currentday realpolitik but tywin is obviously a man with his eye on the prize the security and stability of his family even after dust claims them all dance freakinâ<U+0080><U+0099> owned this part a scene that lasts all of five minutes and i liked how jaime was used even the most arrogant of us can turn into children when our fathers are angry with us i finally liked how tywin was far more measured here in his relationship with tyrion yes heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a runt but heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s one of us and he explains â<U+0080><U+0093> as if it needed explaining â<U+0080><U+0093>why you cannot just take a lannister and you break that rule at your peril nowâ<U+0080> say something clever small detail i loved its cold in the tent tywinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s breath can be seen when he speaks i love that stuff  small detail i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t like i know itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a british thing but how come they say â<U+0080><U+009C>dinâ<U+0080><U+009D>esty it sounds so small 2 the warnings to ned stark as i stated above i really liked how the show unpeeled nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s problem in the exact manner of the books a stoneheaded honorbound ned stark waltzes methodically to his doom the impending doom of ned is classic because even in retrospect its hard to say that unless you know its coming that one can say they saw it coming but look back on renly and lf and even cersei they all tell him to lay off or to get in good with a powerbroker instead boom boom boomâ<U+0080> doom doom doom 3 cersei lannister loving the hate the two sides of cersei lannister were on full display cersei the wounded woman â<U+0080><U+0093> both physically and mentally how she loved robert and how he hurt her and hurt her she then expresses to ned her wrath and warns him not to play the game unless he plays to win fiftyminutes later she is sitting atop the dais and making good on her promise 4 littlefinger just ignore the whores if you remove the grotesquely uncomfortable and unnecessary sex scene lfâ<U+0080><U+0099>s monologue is very telling and then the writers tie it back together to the sex scene listen carefully and it all makes sense what is lf talking about sex or powerâ<U+0080><U+009C>slowlyâ<U+0080> youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re not fooling them â<U+0080> they know what you areâ<U+0080> youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re job is to make them forget what they knowâ<U+0080> that takes timeâ<U+0080> ease into itâ<U+0080> â<U+0080><U+009C> â<U+0080><U+009C>heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s winning you over in spite of himselfâ<U+0080> he knows heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s better than other men â<U+0080> overcoming youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re very natureâ<U+0080> â<U+0080><U+009C> â<U+0080><U+009C>because what we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know usually is what gets us killedâ<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>who could compare to himâ<U+0080> heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just so â<U+0080> goodâ<U+0080>â<U+0080><U+009D> seriously what was brilliant is that we see sex but what is lf really talking about sexâ<U+0080> or his gambles for power whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s doing the fooling and who is making the forget because while the right hand was doing one thingâ<U+0080> the left was doing quite another a really really good scene5 death of a king i am just really really happy addy was robert he was just perfect and he once again and for the last time  nailed his last scene i also enjoyed selmy and how ned played it a really really good scene wound should have been bigger thoughand they should have kept in the lines about how aerys was worse6 and then the shit hit the fan climax was epic selmy cersi ned the hound lf perfect what i am iffy on1 theon greyjoy king of the secondtolast word i am really certain i could have done without the vast majority of theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scenes but i appreciate why they are there just â<U+0080> does he have to be such a stuttering prick everyone gets the last laugh on theon and itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a chilling vision of things to come i just wish it fit in better with what else was going on 2 and i was the last kid picked for kickball kal said it best but with everything going on having to listen to jon snow complain about not being a ranger was so sorry and so lame it was classic petulant waste the story is unfolding tremendously and rapidy and with great peril for allâ<U+0080> and bitchy mcbitcherton is once again only concerned with how the world is unfair to him 3 the words of the nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s watch they just seem silly when said in unison and to a tree i know thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not right but i thought it was flat 4 tywin lannister keeper of the obvious metaphor odd to see tywin getting his hands so very dirty so unlike the book i can get behind that i just wish the show had been less obvious with what is going on tywin is butchering â<U+0080> a crowned stagâ<U+0080> symbol of house baratheon any wonder what is going on i did not like and i am sorry1 the kahl that yelled at no one its universally agreed that khal dragonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s speech as epic but it to me was the worst of both worlds first and foremost in the book the speech is not to his khaldasar its to dany itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a slow smoldering rage being fed methodically by his rage but hes not yelling heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not carrying ion its to dany he is doing this its for her and so he speaks only to her quietly but no louder than he needs to the show wrecks it all instead of a determined khal we have â<U+0080><U+009C>khal pete carroll â<U+0080><U+009C> i am so pumped and jacked at what we are going to do why is he yelling heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the khal what is he afraid of that they wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t follow its so so lame and then add this who the fuck is he talking to remember my constant complaint about the lack of people whoa re you know actually in the hoard there are like 20 people in that tent max why is he trying to get them so excited why is he on the radio or something it was a terrible clash of â<U+0080><U+009C>better in the bookâ<U+0080><U+009D> and â<U+0080><U+009C>the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s own limitations stunt what it was trying to doâ<U+0080><U+009D> i know i am in the minority but this scene made me only think that the show only gets half of what it is trying to do edited by rockroi 23 may 2011

"Tywin's bastard",2011-05-23,"finally jason momoa got to do something really special as khal drogo and he executed that perfectly amazing that a long speech in a made up language can be so entertaining and draw you in that much it really felt like the urge of war stirred in the great warrior and he made it feel like something fierce is going to strike westeroscharles dance is fantastic as tywin lannister so it wasnt even necessary to try to try to go for exact likeness he really got the stern persona across and you can understand why all his children almost fear him even as adults nikolaj did a great job showing emotions with just expressions when tywin was talking and together they made a great scene that built on both characters and the events of the storyser jorah also continues to impress and iain is probably the biggest improvement over the book since his presence as an actor is making me much more emotionally attached to the character and the connection is happening earlier than in the booksthe borgias has been despite the historical opportunity very tame and tasteful for the most part rarely throwing us tits and ass for the purpose of ogling i suppose theres still plenty of room for that to come in their decadent decline but so far its been a very good show better than got imo spartacus was starz not showtime and was a mixed bag i didnt exactly like the way they handled nudity but for some reason it never bbothered me anywhere near as much as gots use of it has if theyre trying to one up these programmes in tackiness well fair play to them i suppose they woneven if i try i cant see how got can come anywhere close to beating spartacus in that area got has a good deal of exposure but spartacus isnt really wrongly described as softcore porn showing more and having much longer scenes that rarely told any story which basically all got sex scenes do"

"SerArthurHeath",2011-05-23,"i thought this episode was easily the worst of the bunch and it exemplified all of my fears about this show here goesroberts death just show the hunting scene the king died thatâ<U+0092>s a bfd we find out second hand thats not good tv its good storytelling when youre writing from a close third person but this show doesnt have that limitation imagine youve never seen this show before it would make the plot alot clearer if we watched robert drunkenly fight the boar and lancel getting him hammered i think that omission ruined this episode for me hands down this isnt the book stop trying to be the bookthe littlefinger porn tryout was horrible a 5 minute long scene including 3 minutes of play with her ass what they couldve made that scene 30 seconds long and still moved the plot where it needed to be littlefinger is a pimp and has twisted feelings for cat if you need a hardcore porn scene to get that point across youre failing at making tvneds scenes are borderline parody in this episode here are some questions a nonreader is asking why didnt ned tell robert about his son even on his deathbed why bother warning cersei or moreso why didnt robert keep witnesses in the room when he named ned the protector i know grrm didnt address these issues either but if i didnt read the books im dumbfounded seeing his plot unfold over ten weeks makes neds personality faults seem unbelievabletheon and asha osha i forget are such minor characters in book 1 that scene couldve easily been cut i wonder what rob arya or tyrion were up to 5 minutes with one of them wouldve been niceedit the more i think about it the more i hate that lf scene the rest i can live with the lf scene is just horrible tv from every angle i can imaginei strongly disagree with you in any medium finding out suddenly from neds pov what happened to robert rather than seeing it creates far more suspense surprise and emotion for me if theyd shown him being gored i would have hated itlots of people think neds actions are ridiculous in the books i dont think theyve changed that on tvwp so far people have gotten that ned was silly but was doing it because he was honourable i think the scenes do highlight neds choices as foolish but im fairly sure thats diberatd and consistent with the source if you dont like it your problem is with ned not the writersill agree on theon and on asha though i thought the overall tone was easily the best episode so far though in a different league from the first 4 which were also good"
"SerArthurHeath",2011-05-23,"also robbs already more fleshed out than he was in book 1 anyway and they are setting up theon so they dont have to waste an episode next season on his character and background they are establishing osha as a character to remember in book 2 i had no clue who theon was and im glad theyve avoided this"
"Dremora",2011-05-23,"i have no problem with the theon scenes if they didnt show them now then it would be hard to explain why he betrays rob or people would be thinking whos he i fucking loved drogos speach even in a made up language it was epic also dont see a problem with littlefingers ending either this was my fav episode so far"

"Mad Sweeney",2011-05-23,"while some were turned off by that scene for its gratuitous nudity i think a lot of us were turned off by the simple fact that it was pointless offered nothing new except some clarification on how littlefinger tried to win catelyns hand and also made his turn at the end of the episode way too predictable for the nonreaderthey shouldve just omitted it completely and used those other 34 minutes on better filler you know how about on king robert whose sudden death came by even more swiftly than the books i wouldve loved to see an extra scene of his at his death bedi had more problems with that lf scene than i did with viserys bathtub scene with doreah at least viserys scene fleshed him out further as he previously only had dialogue with jorah or dany and let the casual audience know of the significance of the dragons both as their house sigil and that they used to but no longer existpointless i got a lot of who and what lf is out of that scene who he is for real when hes not out playing the game which isnt something that weve really seen yet i was riveted to his words while he was both watching but not seeing or seeing his pastpresent in their actions what the girls were doing why do we need more of king robert we already got way more than was in the book and the plotline of his was over they already covered him in those previous episodes anything else with him would be gratuitous even more pointless than you think the lf scene would be since they only have 3 more episodes to conclude the book as for gratuity seriously the land of rape and murder and you think some boobies are gratuitous if hbo did the book as it was written it would get an x rating no amount of nipple or blood is gratuitous in this world plus its hbo they do sexy dramas part of the package that comes with having your show on their channel his turn at the end shouldve been seen by a lot of readerswatchers ahead of time since hes an admitted opportunist with no loyalties other than to himself and with a grudge already against the starks and a plan to make a smooth transition of power that ned rejected"

"Gnomestress",2011-05-24,"heres a thought on tywin skinning the stag  the stag is the symbol of house baratheon king robert has definietely displeased him since the starks are not punished for kidnapping a lannister maybe him skinning the stag was meant to be symbolic of his plotting to take out the king edit  modehead beat me to it great minds think alike edited by gnomestress 24 may 2011  0854 am"
"Lord Varys",2011-05-24,"the littlefinger brothel scene actually works way better than any possible scene which would littlefinger have to confide in to lothor brune or oswell kettleblack combining sex work and littlefingers approach to power is a good idea here especially as he does not lay out his plans in detail and only becomes explicit when he confesses that he wants everything but im not sure if it was good to make him a pimp who happens to be good at finances instead of the head of the treasury who happens to own a few brothels to enrich himself and im not sure if this scene should have been in this episode before he betrays ned i really liked the subtle littlefinger of the books more the funny man no one sees as a real threat not even the reader until its to late they could foreshadowed his betrayal during the scene where they discussed stannis and the succession if they had elaborated on stannis giving the realm a new hand and a new council the audience would have immediately realized that littlefinger did not want to be fired tywin would never ever skin a stag or another animal himself he is tywin lannister after all but i accept this for the sake of symbolism as it really shows quite nicely how the lion of casterly rock took away the realm from the stag golden dragon after golden dragon and im really thankful that they did not talk about this explicitly grrm uses this symbolism quite effectively himself and i really do hope they will show us roose bolton skinninghunting wolves"
"Ramsay Bolton",2011-05-24,"i loved the tywin scene myself best scene of the episode maybe it was because of charles dance and his commanding presence though i always thought tywin was first and foremost a ruthless and fiercely proud man but not someone who wouldnt get their hands dirty having him casually skin a stag quite difficult to do id imagine while scorning his son shows that this isnt just some rich guy who lent a lot of gold to the throne but a methodical dangerous man the metaphor was just a fun thing added in there the point was to introduce a skilled and feared man whose presence makes even the most arrogant knight look like a little child"

"Hombre de Murcielago",2011-05-24,"best episode so far imo with the exception of the ridiculous lf brothel scene this was the first episode that had the feel of the books for me the tension in kings landing was spot on and drogos speech was chilling sam and jons vows along with the shot of the face on the weirwood tree was fantastic i liked the tywin scene the metaphor was obvious but appropriate and i do think that tywin would skin his own kill hes not the type of man to leave the messy bits to others just because hes afraid to get his hands dirty"

"Wunhopkuendo",2011-05-24,"the lf brothel scene is not bad because of the sex or his directing or roz for that matter the scene is terrible because it is so unbelievable that he would just lay out his plan if not the actual method at least the impetus to his newest whores it did resonate a bit like deadwood which worked very well in that series but this isnt deadwood and lf isnt swerengensp the may both keep with the company of whores but the former lives in a world of spies everywhere while the latter just lives with whores i think the hbo stumbled onto something with deadwood and are attempting to reproduce it here but it just doesnt work lf is supposed to be far more subtle than that but oh well i hated the scene but i can certainly move past it seeing how this is the only scene i have hated so far and hate is a strong word because i really love hot lesbian action scenes lol as to the purity of the books people have to understand two things here first it is a different medium and must be approached differently than a book written for pov perspectives and secondly we have the author consulting here if anyone has ever written anything in their life there will never be a time that you dont look over your work and wish you had done something differently well grrm has that opportunity he can assist with adding certain lines or taking away scenes or developing characters further than he originally had done who is to say that many of the changes arent for this very reason i have no idea if the stag is real but it does look real and skinning a stag takes a lot of time it isnt something that has to be done in 30 minutes or the meat goes bad that is gutting which is obviously already done so it might very well be real it looks cool when tywin is skinning it but to be honest he is only going through the motions he isnt really skinning much of anything he just keeps cutting away in the same area so it could very well be a prop the fact that an experienced skinner like myself cant even tell for certain is testament to how good the scene was"

"Greylander",2011-05-24,"on tywin dressing the stag this is entirely in character for tywin as presented in the books the dressing of the stag itself appears to be a meditation for him or as others have said a ritual it shows him as methodical and without sentimentality as to him being too rich to get his hands dirty  where in the books do we ever get that impression of tywin other than from the simple fact that he is rich part of the reason he is so rich is that he is clearly a nononsense nofrills kind of guy he is the type of rich man who will haggle over pennies just on principle he is calculating rigid absolutely selfdisciplined it makes sense that he would have some kind of activity like this for meditative purpose  maybe he skins his own kills because it keep him in touch with the brutal nature of life for the attentive viewer of course the stag is also symbolic as many have noted"

"Ser Greguh",2011-05-25,"well surprise surprise people actually arent so juvenile to be happy about character development being shortchanged for sexsceneswell surprise surprise some of us are mature enough to understand that a scene that has boobies in it is not necessarily also a scene that shortchanges character development for anyone paying attention not distracted by the sex and that has a brain cell or two to rub together that scene did almost as much to develop littlefinger as any one scene has done to develop any character thusfar in the series its one thing if youre a prude and dislike sex or nudity but dont pretend that anyone that reacts with something other than disgust to a scene that features those things is doing so only because theyre a horny teenager"
"JagfyrBlackfyre",2011-05-25,"quit the bitchin peeplz this episode was great tywins introduction was way more formidable than in the books and i was glad to witness a dialogue that did not occur in the books at all the complexity of jaimes character was well touched upon in the scene and tywin provided an interesting opinion regarding the motivations of any ambitious house in westeros also why wouldnt tywin flay a stag as he was doing he may prefer to not charge into battle on the front lines but he is hardly afraid to get his hands dirty by still leading the reserve troops tending to shae brutally rendering the reynes of castamere extinct with the rozlittlefinger brothel scene i will admit that it was a tad long in a story where theres so much more to develop on and showcase but it still made for a great scene littlefingers motivations are a fascinating element all throughout books as well what he is trying to play at can leave even the best reader vexed and excited to see more so having a scene like this added in was great as i feel that it added to my perception of him even after being four books deep the sex definitely made the dialogue a bit harder to follow quite a pleasant distraction but it was still fitting for the locale for framing what littlefinger says and within the context of a story that heavily involves whores and brothels as necessary plot elements littlefinger also gets a more sinister mien about him during this scene which sets up the end of the episode better for a non reader we never had a catelyn chapter detailing littlefingers fight with big brandon stark in a convenient third person voice so that history has to get laid out somewhere and what better way to do it than amongst a portrayal of superficial and selfserving sex  like the kind littlefinger likely wanted with catelyn roz is hot and she has a wicked way of portraying her character so seeing more of her is fine by me likely she will be important in developing certain plot elements like the state of kings landing before the blackwater battle and may even replace chataya or alaya at some point throughout the books there is little focus on the common folk and roz provides a bit of that necessary perspective to get the full picture of this world reliving the tense ending of the episode still evoked the same feelings of outrage i experienced while reading the book even though i knew exactly what was coming i chalk that up to excellent acting more than anything else the cast is really great despite the fact that casting so many odd and colorful characters as well as less experienced children seems especially hard to do also khal drogos dialogue near the end was awesome i felt pumped to plunder and kick some westerosi ass after seeing that"
"DurararaFTW",2011-05-25,"well surprise surprise some of us are mature enough to understand that a scene that has boobies in it is not necessarily also a scene that shortchanges character development for anyone paying attention not distracted by the sex and that has a brain cell or two to rub together that scene did almost as much to develop littlefinger as any one scene has done to develop any character thusfar in the series its one thing if youre a prude and dislike sex or nudity but dont pretend that anyone that reacts with something other than disgust to a scene that features those things is doing so only because theyre a horny teenageryeah it develops him about three seasons in advance and completely gives away what was one of the major twists in the first book before the respective scene happens in exchange cersei doesnt kill his baby just because its roberts which seemed important to me robert doesnt lament his poor kinghood as even worse then aerys and now never will and i could go on and on so no just some naked ladies does not make up for that in my opinion and im gonna be very surprised if whatever role roz is gonna play is gonna change his mind"
"ryamano",2011-05-25,"yeah it develops him about three seasons in advance and completely gives away what was one of the major twists in the first book before the respective scene happens in exchange cersei doesnt kill his baby just because its roberts which seemed important to me robert doesnt lament his poor kinghood as even worse then aerys and now never will and i could go on and on so no just some naked ladies does not make up for that in my opinion and im gonna be very surprised if whatever role roz is gonna play is gonna change his mindsomething i noticed in the tv series is that their approach to events is different from the booksin the books its events happens   consequences happen  character shows his motivations for doing the event that wayin the tv series its character shows his motivation  event happens  consequences happenlfs betrayal neds death the red wedding renlys ghost appearing in the battle of kings landing jofreys death etc are examples of this in the booksi think this may be due to a different form of storytelling due to the difference in media its a choice the tv show has made if its good or bad depends on individual taste i dont like it but i understand their choice and understand that theyre sticking with it also the tv show doesnt have to mirror the book completely in the reveals the tv show has used povs of cersei and jaime that appear only in books 3 and 4 to show them in better light than theyre portrayed in book 1 in which they seem almost one dimensional villains edited by ryamano 25 may 2011  0432 am"

"ryamano",2011-05-25,"i liked tywyns introduction i thought it was weird that he was dressing the carcass but still that scene served to establish so much his ruthlessness his desire to be respected his relatioship with his kids etc it also served to convey that this guy can strike fear and awe in the hearts of others great choice in the actor who portrayed tywyn very well even if he doesnt look much like what i thought side whiskers"

"Maia",2011-05-25,"i have only seen the preview but the art of hunting and dressing the kill was a substantial part of education of every medieval nobleman hunting was also quite important for image  it showed that the nobleman was fit and warlike and tywin always did everything that he considered important for his image and that of house lannister whether he enjoyed it or not like dancing at the feasts dressing flamboyantly etc so why not hunting he must have done something to stay so phenomenally in shape anyway what i personally find incongruous is that he seems to be dressing the kill in his tent  i am no expert but it seems implausible to me"

"The Badger of Winterfell",2011-05-25,"i thought it was a fantastic episode the scenes that seem to be most contentious were the added lf and tywin scenes i personally loved the tywin scene i can see where people are coming from when they say tywin isnt the type to get his hands dirty but dressing a kill is not the same as say personally executing someone i still think the show tywin will be mainly about plotting behind the scenes but i think it was a fun addition to the scene that enhanced not detracted from his character also saw charles dance literally days earlier as lord vetinari from terry pratchetts discworld and he was just as amazing as i thought he was going to be less sure about the lf scene unlike some people didnt especially mind the actually nudity bits i can actually imagine littlefinger as someone who micromanages his whores it was the whole exposition part of his monologue i didnt like one it seemed out of character for lf to share so much information for no practical gain and two it did kind of spoil the surprise about hiis betrayal it seemed to me theyd purposefully underplayed lfs untrustworthiness in previous episodes so that his betrayal would be more unexpected then they slapped in this scene where it basically reveals lf hates ned overall though absolutely fantastic especially the i did warn you not trust me line one of the moments id been waiting for with bated breath and aiden gillan didnt disappoint"

"Mad Sweeney",2011-05-26,"this is your opinion what did it add to littlefingers character that hes a scheming pimp with twisted feelings for cat we all know that alreadywell it highlighted his short mans complex with the description of his ways versus the ways of the stronger men he has to fight with for his ambitious goals it also showed that he is perfectly capable of ignoring the goods in front of him to achieve his very particular goals hes not interested in the two women right in front of him hes barely even looking at them as sexual objects as they relate to him theyre tools that hes training just like all the other people that he uses and since theyre just tools like all the other tools he uses once they have no value to him they can be discarded just as ned is maybe thats a little hindsight as a revelation since ive already seen the depths he goes to but the impersonal way he treated the girls and his complete disinterest in them as people can quite easily be seen from that i have to watch it again on the big tv after this weekend to get more but its not opinion that the scene added no character development to lf its just plain wrong"

"malarky1231",2011-05-28,"i didnt mind the sex scene at all i mean cmon its hbo you gotta have all the sex and violence the two practically go hand in hand i do agree that tywin lannister skinning the deer was heavyhanded yet hard for nonreaders to analyze the scene with lf telling how he is going to get what is rightfully his complements nicely with the two whores sex scene all in all i think it was a bit confusing for nonreaders to understand and overdone and contrived for readers they definitely couldve left some scenes out but that wouldve made things even more confusing the sex and violence itself is fine but the purpose of those scenes is questionable"

"malarky1231",2011-05-28,"do you mean the part where she escapes probably in the episode eight if youre asking for the part where shes chasing cats and follows it into the place where they keep the dragon bones then that would be episode five"

"Mad Sweeney",2011-05-29,"its true camelot and the borgias dont even come close to got at the same time as previous users have said the sex scenes are less tolerable in got bc they dont advance the plot any of the character developments that have occurred during a sex scene couldve been done without them thats not to say im opposed to the sex but when its pointless i dont see the need for it how is theon ploughing roz advancing the storyline they couldve developed his story without the use of a sex scene the same goes for lf he couldve made viewers aware of his ruthless ambition another way or even excluded it altogether until his betrayal of ned however cerseis sex scene with jaime was completely justified and unavoidable bc it advanced the plot and was a catalyst for catelyn and brans journeymartin wrote a hyper sexual series you guys are acting like every time he used the word ct or raped someone that it was only for the sheer advancement of the plot and was absolutely necessary because no other scenario would advance the plotcharacters lmaogif classbbcemoticon altlmao  too much fanboy ignorance going around hbo cant show a 14 year old girl getting fingerbanged on her birthday so they make up the sexuality in other ways how does it advance the series it gets more viewers interested in the show sex sell you want a season 3 or not book fans arent going to make up enough of an audience for that others must be drawn in when people find out its a character driven sexy violent story and not some dd prurian geeky teen trolls and giants and knights full of derring do saving vestile virgins then theyll tune in and keep the seasons coming if you cant stomach them just for that reason alone then you all have a lot of growing up to do"
