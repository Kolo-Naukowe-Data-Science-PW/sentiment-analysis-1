"congokong",2012-05-06,"glad to hear ramsay will be in it but as a purist this season has been painful the show only uses the books as a guideline now dont say its because of budget last season stayed very close to the books and a lot of plotsscenes have been added most of the dialogue in the show now never happened in the books"

"FaelaeshioDream",2012-05-06,"it is now a given that there are going to be big deviations from the books i judge on whether they make the series better worse or just different tonight it was all better for me shaesanza kidnapped dragons both improved the show with all the serious action and excitement in the 7 kingdoms dany needed a thrill excitement boost to her storyline otherwise it can drag in this book"
"Lord Godric",2012-05-06,"do we know for certain that irri is dead if so theyre really reducing her khalasar to a handful of people also the reason i was so happy to hear that rooses bastard hasnt been cut even though he was never cast is because it gives us hope that the reeds will turn up next season too i imagine this season must somehow end with bran and rickon emerging from the crypts and well just see a helmeted ramsey take back winterfell"

"MSUMC25",2012-05-06,"stolen dragons those damn warlocks great twist away from the books i also love the arya and tywin interactions their personalities mesh and this is an improvement from the books in my opinion im also interested to see if ramsey burns winterfledt as soon as he takes it over or robbs marrying that foreign girls springs it its also interesting they arent setting up tywin using the westerling daughter to drive a wedge between the north and the frey"

"axels15",2012-05-06,"this was by far my favorite episode of the season i give it 910 but only because i dont think anything can be truly perfect the good ygritte  i could not stop saying throughout the episode how much i liked her what a great casting im absolutely stunned i found it a little strange for jon to be separated from the other nights watch brothers but im sure itll work itself out in the end as long as they dont change the real reason for jon killing the halfhand following orders then i am completely fine with it  aryatywinlittlefinger i love those scenes i really do and even though i know littlefinger never recognizes arya because it never happened in the books and would have been very difficult to explain it was still nervewracking it was done extremely well i say it could never happen but considering dany lost the dragons i suppose anything can happen  robbtalissa  so were setting her up to be a spy then and actually probably is jeyne westerling im fine with that it makes sense to me i enjoy it theon  wow was that opening scene great or what just the facial expressions from theon when deciding about roderik i couldnt help myself from feeling some strong sorrow and even maybe sympathy  the riot scene and before  more or less straight out of the books correct the anger from tyrion the stupidity of joffrey the saviorness of the hound and the fear from sansa were all portrayed wonderfully when the septon got torn apart wow speaking of which theon cutting off rodericks head was awesomely gory and a good juxtaposition to the man ned executes at the beginning of season one  danys first scene  names escape me but where she is requesting the ships  that man is wonderfully deviant and quite funny and a little fierce too when he wants to be i think it was one of her best scenes in the show as well the im not sure yet pretty much just the dragons at the end i dont have a problem with it and it makes it interesting it certainly adds more to the house of the undying yes the bad none the interesting"
"towerofjoy",2012-05-06,"i think all the backandforth editing took away from the impact quite a bit but did like the focus on all the starks 1 sansa beaten almost raped and rescued by sandor 2 arya spotted by baelish lorch and rescued by jaqen 3 bran and rickon held captive by theon and rescued by osha 4 robb beguiled by talisa and rescued from temptation for now by his mom 5 jon beguiled by ygritte and rescued from temptation again for now by the cold"
"lostinwesteros",2012-05-06,"about the dragons  i loved seeing two of their tails twitching as they were carried up the steps and like someone else just said i cant wait to see drogon burn the bad guys to a crispi wonder if the person who betrayed dani is doreah whoever it was it am guessing the warlocks have them and thats the reason she goes to the house of the undying big departure but makes sense always wondered that no one tried this in the bookyes this was a big big shock cant believe irri is dead  great idea about it being doreah i never thought of that but it was absolutely set up in the last episodejust like most have said big big changes from the books i think i can operate in both realities though this show was great"
"morillo",2012-05-06,"disappointed not seeing jojen and meera reed"
"House Snow",2012-05-06,"to me the big wuestion is dagmerramsey how else does bolton know everything that is going on in winterfell luwin sent his message before rodrik was killed"
"Independent George",2012-05-06,"i let out a woot when roose mentioned his bastard son the riot scene was intense dismembering the high septon was a bit much though i think the disembowelment and nearrape of a young girl was quite enough thank you very much one change i didnt like was killing ser amory with the poison dart it was a welldone scene on its own but the great thing about weeses death was that you were left scratching your head at how he got the dog to go nuts and kill his own master"

"Bastard of Boston",2012-05-06,"first it must be said it is thee biggest elephant in the room i saw tonks boobs stupefy i loled at how unimpressed bran was when theon with his chest puffed out gave him his wake up call it was like bran was two seconds away from hitting the snooze button and telling theon to come back in 10 minutes gods help you theon greyjoy indeed rip ser rodrik i enjoyed this episode im waiting for the uproar over the aryatywin bond though and how tywin would never ever befriend a cup bearer because hes tywin and has no time for charming family anecdotes or unnecessary bowel movements  once a day is plenty personally i cant say i mind that tywin is being humanizedeven made likeable i think it adds to the grayness of the show and the smile arya let slip when complimented was also something i liked  i think arya got a rise out of being complimented by someone as capable as tywin she may hate him but she respects him also i like how theyre going about excusing her three choicesits shades of the old wasting 3 wishes gag damn it geniei wish you would just shut up so i can thinkwait no i dont wish that she was forced to use that death wish because of the situation littlefingers appearance in this episode added some decent tension and i fully believe that he recognized aryaand just chose to keep it to himself why would he out arya when knowledge is power and outting arya is giving up power cant wait to see where this goes also liked the little tweaks to ygrittejons meeting it feels a little more i dunno believable that jon wouldnt allow ygritte to leavehe just cant bring himself to kill her so hed rather try and carry her around as a prisoner i think rose leslie will do well with the role another joff slap is always funadd that to the reel i will make this into a drinking game one day also i like this friendship theyre developing between sansa and shae if nothing else it will give shae something to domaybe even turn her into a better character than she was in the books itll make her later choices more difficult heh the qarth spice merchant is good times im sorry but i kind of enjoyed how condescending he was to dany she needs it every so often the dragon theft was an interesting nonbook developmentguess this is the got crew trying to invent things for dany to do since shes pretty absent for so much of clash we also got pretty good confrmation that talisa is indeed a liar and most likely jeyne did anyone see the letter arya found on tywins table is jeyne spying on robb and sending intel to tywin it looks like shes up to no good oona chaplin is hot and thank you roose for confirming that your psychotic bastard ramsay will grace us with his fuckery cant wait edited by bastard of boston 06 may 2012  0933 pm"
"SelaBela",2012-05-06,"man this episode was awesome so strong i loved every second tbh i was on the edge of my seat for aryatywin phew that was close i like the way they got the second name out of her without it being tywin petyr being there just had my heart in my throat for arya i love that i dont know whats going to happen crucify me if you must purists but i actually am loving the changes tyrion nailed it loved the sansan scenes heart is bursting with happiness jonygritte made me laugh so hard loved it i actually hated ygritte in the books but i might actually like this chick a bit"
"Lord Belmore",2012-05-06,"i was ready to be mad about theon killing rodrik instead of the boltons but roose mentioning his bastard erased that from a deficit to a gain we still get the boltons theyll still betray the starks but theon takes out rodrik as the more emotional choice i didnt dislike anything else so thumbs up to the episode i do hope daenerys still somehow gets her visions in the house of the undying but i didnt love it enough that its lack will ruin anything for me"
"dtones520",2012-05-06,"did anyone else notice a potential lollys sighting in the riot scene there was a bigger girl getting her shirt ripped off and i immediately said lollys"
"Trebla",2012-05-06,"that was a fabulous episode perhaps the best so far this season i enjoyed the deviations arya having to rush the kill of lorch arya practically playing peek a boo with littlefinger im really enjoying her interaction with tywin because it gives her an out for the most obvious question why doesnt she use a kill on tywin its harder to that without her inner dialogue i love yrgitte shes a fantastic casting choice and i enjoyed her new scenes with jon had to giggle at her grinding her ass into jon his balls are going to be blue for other reasons that being cold and the capper the case of the missing dragons it gives dany a lot more to do that just telling everybody she is the blood of the dragonmother of dragonsstormbornunburnt"
"House Snow",2012-05-06,"funny park of the episode for me was when jon was snuggling ygritte she started a sentece and i was so sure she was going to say you know nothing john snow and she said instead youre stupid so close"
"Triskan",2012-05-06,"i love yrgitte shes a fantastic casting choice and i enjoyed her new scenes with jon had to giggle at her grinding her ass into jon his balls are going to be blue for other reasons that being coldhow dare you serthere are children on this board"

"Laohu",2012-05-06,"uh wtf just happened here at the end i did not see that one coming guess dany has more incentive to visit pyat pree at the hotu"
"LuisDantas",2012-05-06,"the changes were even deeper this time mostly worked however theon  i love his lost look after butchering rodrik i can almost hear he doubting he did it himself maester luwin and bran had some great lines and delivery as well i particularly liked brans tothepoint question and how even theon himself seems to wonder if he always hated the starks or if he does even now if only he had followed a bit more of maester luwins advice i felt like telling him that in order to be respected as lord of winterfell he would have to show a willingness to follow the northern ways of good will and show mercy at least at first eta oh and rodriks last line was just perfect i found myself fully agreeing daenerys  i never expected such a strong deviation from the books still the plot seems to be moving fast jon  i disliked that jon promised to kill ygritte in this version of the tale it is surprising that he seems to have lost the other rangers on the plus side jon and ygritte have great chemistry on the screen i loved their scene together robb  great lines here as well talisa does indeed amputate far better than she lies maybe she is a spy for tywin i feel that we are expected to suspect so tywin  the dislexia line caught me unaware i dont know what to make of tywin as a parent after that arya  great justification for choosing amory lorch arya probably expects to have some use as a spy for robb and therefore would rather not ask for tywins head particularly now that he has bonded somewhat with her great scene with the book of houses as well catelyn  she picked up on robbs feelings the moment she saw him with talisa i liked that i wish i could disagree with her reminder about robbs duties asha  i am not in love with the changes seen but are they even changes at all they fit perfectly with ashas pragmatism roose bolton  so now he is intentionally loosing ramsay on winterfell and announcing that he is doing so quite a change although it might not have lasting consequences petyr baelish  does the timeline in the books fit his suggestion that the lannisters pursue an alliance with the tyrells it does sound exactly like the sort of insidious counsel that he would give to weaken everyone else on that note it is interesting that apparently the unholy magic used to kill renly isnt such a secret in the tv show i have a feeling that we will have more clear reason to question davos opinion about stannis here which of course is a good thing  stannis gets the get out of prison free card way too often eta i found myself wondering about lollys does she even exist in this continuity it could go either way a pity that the riot scene did not involve horses they would have added a lot budgets are a sad reality edited by luisdantas 06 may 2012  0946 pm"
"Triskan",2012-05-06,"is it ok to discuss the scenes from the next episode in this thread or should that go to the e7 section"
"Joshua Stevens",2012-05-06,"who took the dragons and how was this episode over so quickly best one yet i think joshua stephens and greyjoy07 wow never seen that coming and dont have a clue who took them anybody else have any suggestions think they added this to give dany more scenes since so few in the books"
"axels15",2012-05-06,"one change i didnt like was killing ser amory with the poison dart it was a welldone scene on its own but the great thing about weeses death was that you were left scratching your head at how he got the dog to go nuts and kill his own masterid argue that its pretty damn impressive for him to get that blow dart into him without anyone seeing i mean that hallway cant have been too big maybe not supernatural but damn talented"
"MSUMC25",2012-05-06,"talissa  jeyne this makes so much sense howd i miss that anyways this is a way better set up than in the books glad ramsey will make an appearance and piss off everyone who hasnt read the books dreaming of jon snow putting a sword through his head"

"J_Crews",2012-05-06,"im pretty sure that there was nothing that indicated no visions all the scene was meant to do was to get dany to the hotu in an exciting way once she gets there pyat pree can tell her that if she wants her dragons she can do what he says then she drinks shade of the evening has visions and gets the dragons backthen dracarys dead warlocksalso killing handmaidsnot paying those actors next season which means money to pay other actors no need to waste budget dollars on irri who plays no role in the book other than waiting on dany when you can use that on edmure or jojen or meera or ramsayagreed irri iswas dead weight i hope doreah wasnt the culprit as some are suggesting however shes so adorable id like to keep her for a while longer"
"Magic 8 Ball",2012-05-06,"how was a doreah betrayal hinted at last week i missed that also add my thumbs up to the dragonnapping biggest on screen deviation so far but the meanderings of dany in essos need some spicing up bring it on"
"Lord Godric",2012-05-06,"i definitely agree that while the story was changed  the essence of the characters and of the story have been true to what martin created and that is what is important im glad others are able to see that and appreciate it instead of complaining about all the changes"
"Laohu",2012-05-06,"id argue that its pretty damn impressive for him to get that blow dart into him without anyone seeing i mean that hallway cant have been too big maybe not supernatural but damn talentedthe faceless men are best at what they do i think we can all agree on that"
"HokieStone",2012-05-06,"that beheading was brutal to watch sadpng classbbcemoticon alt even more brutaljust as it happened and rodriks head was rolling across the ground  i hear my 7 year old son  who had apparently snuck out of his bed and down the stairs without me hearing him standing behind me asking daddy what are you watching aw shitwhat did you see son umi saw a man cutting off another mans head fuck guess ill be reading the board at 300 am tonight after i deal with his nightmares"
"PhoenixFlame",2012-05-06,"scenes that got the biggest reactions from me  the riot i loved how tyrion was realizing oh no shits going down and got tommen out of there joffreys eruption was perfect i also thought they captured tyrions own panic really well hes usually so calm and put together but i dont care how badass you are an angry mob is scary he sounded like he was about to have a heart attack oh and sansan at long last i also loved how he started dragging joffrey away so undignified xd  the opening agreed i almost expected bran to be lol stop messing around when theon entered then his hysteria and theons face as he hacked rodriks head offwow  tywins room i loved the detail about jaime being dyslexic question  do twins commonly share problems like that i wonder if cersei is dyslexic too but no one bothered with her because she was a girl at least in tv canon and aryas selfsatisfied smile was perfect as was her question about tywins father  the assassination jaquens face was pure gold when arya barked now then the dartwow i was in hysterics  bastards i squeed when roose said his son would be honored to drive theon out but now im curious as to when roose is going to betray robb and ramsay take winterfell or maybe robb thinks ramsay has taken winterfell purely under orders and is just waiting out a snow storm or something to bring in theon while of course ramsay has torched it  osha tonks busting the kiddos out was awesome and we got a glimpse of shaggydog loved it when she slit the guys throat  great shot of her with her arm out looking like a ninja  mr spicer hes fierce i loved how he totally schools dany i dont hate dany like some do but i giggle nonstop when she gets taken down a peg"

"Cheese Pudding",2012-05-06,"im pretty sure that whoever stole the dragons is going to the house of the undying so she will probably pick them up thereim pretty sure that there was nothing that indicated no visions all the scene was meant to do was to get dany to the hotu in an exciting way once she gets there pyat pree can tell her that if she wants her dragons she can do what he says then she drinks shade of the evening has visions and gets the dragons backthen dracarys dead warlocksalso killing handmaidsnot paying those actors next season which means money to pay other actors no need to waste budget dollars on irri who plays no role in the book other than waiting on dany when you can use that on edmure or jojen or meera or ramsayas it was implied i know she will go to the house of the undying but i hope im wrong i really hope because i want to see her visions but i feel were not that lucky since shell go there in rage it would make no sense for her to drink the shade of the evening too dangerous for her since they have her dragons ok that made no sense in the books too but she had her dragonsneds dream were cut so maybe danys visions were too sadpng classbbcemoticon alt about why anyone tried it that someone asked in the thread she was at xaros he had good guards and he wanted her dragons so he wanted them safe"

"Cheese Pudding",2012-05-06,"oh this post is just to tell that i liked the episode im questioning just what the theft could have originated but if danys visions were not cut them the episode was like 8510 ygritte was excelente even considering the changes osha is hot we saw shaggy and rickon talked jaqen was awesome as well tywin is still a bit soft for me but his scenes with arya are amazing completely amazing edited by cheese pudding 06 may 2012  1023 pm"
"Francis Buck",2012-05-06,"best episode yet i honestly do not understand how someone can say these changes were negative by doing so youre basically just claiming that grrms story is completely perfect and cannot be altered whatsoever in any way having the dragons be stolen adds an awesome boost to danys storyline that was sorely needed you can tell that theyre really going to be make the hotu intense and very important to danys story this season and the alterations to theons subplot only served to make his arc even more tragic and powerful than it was alfie allens acting this season has easily been in the top five of the show he really just adds a whole new dimension to that plot and beyond anything elseramsay has been confirmed how can you not be fucking psyched about that"
"Bastard of Boston",2012-05-06,"are you guys sure irri is dead i didnt see blood it could be that shes just unconscious ill have to rewatch"
"nara",2012-05-06,"overall okay with the changes they made in this episode the dyslexia thing was strange but i like that it showed tywins true affection for jaime it makes a good contrast for his relationship with tyrion the riot scene was great i thought that sophie did a fantastic job acting the attack sceneit was pretty frightening i miss lollys but considered what happened to her its probably just as well that they left her out i also thought it was better on horses but i can spare the expense if it saves a character love the dany ending unexpected im sure theyll tie it back to her story somehow i like the robbjeyne changes we dont see them fall in love in the books so it explains his actions better not sure i liked the littlefingerarya peekaboo he seemed to recognize her but would he let her go if he caught her i dont think sohed keep track of her sansa and shae as friends but that could be because i dont like shae i dont remember lc mormont telling jon to obey quorin without question it looks like they may leave out the fight where jon has to prove himself by pretending to be a turncloak that would be a real pity because its so critical to his character development hopefully that will turn up in the next episode"
"Gurney Halleck",2012-05-06,"i definitely agree that while the story was changed  the essence of the characters and of the story have been true to what martin created and that is what is important im glad others are able to see that and appreciate it instead of complaining about all the changesindeed accept and be appreciative for the wonderful bounty of hbo goodness that we have recieved for our fandom"

scene needs 12 scenes to set up you start with a quick bit of dialog you advance to rodrick saying that torren square is under attack then boom theon is in branâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bedroom that all made sense we didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need a 20 minute set up or plot advancement we all knew what was going on now i will say that getting ser rodrick back into the castle lookedâ<U+0080> lame it was we can all admit it one guy on a horse just looked sadâ<U+0080> and â<U+0080> do what like 12 people live in winterfell  everything advanced naturally after that branâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dialog â<U+0080><U+009C>did you always hate usâ<U+0080><U+009D> oshaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s actions the escape etc it all made perfect unvarnished sense tight writing quick scenes snappy dialog and done that was fast writing again cassellâ<U+0080><U+0099>s entrance was very sloppy but very goodand watching theon kick his head offâ<U+0080> that was just brutalthe tywin and arya show i could honestly watch the two of them for like 3 hours straight i actually walk up to my tv whenever they are on the screen amazing shit they are writing these scenes with good material from the books but cut deeply with materials that they are making up and its working both characters and actors are hitting such incredible points and making it all so believable and then they added littlefinger and it was all good i mean at this rate i just want to watch them look letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s say hbo just wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t do the whole series but they settle on this format tywin and arya have various characters from a song of ice and fire visit them and they engage in random banter tell me you would not watch that fuck just tywin sits there grills them out while arya runs circles around them one week it would be doran martell the next the crossbow kid from the inn then viserion this would work you would watch every episode and maybe we would see jaime again and didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know jaime was dyslexicthe hound so again there are some scenes that just need to work or the show fails one of them was the beheading at baelorâ<U+0080><U+0099>s another was the shadowbaby etc those scenes have to work or they make us knowâ<U+0080> something is not right see renly and stannis negotiation scene well one of those scenes was the riot at kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s landing and the rise of king bread ha i kill me the show captured the complete chaos of that scene it made us all fear the tinderbox of kl and the unsteady hold this family has on its people when that crowd went ballistic we all believed it that scene hummed along exactly as we had pictured it in our brains with minor changes that do not bother anyone no horses and i am not sure how much strength it takes to rip a human arm off another person tyrion and joff were both incredible that scene fucking worked and then they were raping sansa and for a moment i was like â<U+0080><U+009C>i think they are going to show sansa getting raped and i really really do not want them to rape sansa i really do not need to see that i really want this to not happenâ<U+0080><U+009D> and just when i thought it would happen darth fucking vader walked in and stared making motherfuckers dead he ripped out guts slashed throats and otherwise made men turn into bags of meat and for a moment we all remembered why we know the hound is the hound the carryback and the â<U+0080><U+009C>i didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t do it for youâ<U+0080><U+009D> was all amazing top fucking moment right there robb stark gotta hand it to him the guy acts like a king and at this point watching that volantis chick walk away i almost canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t blame him for the whole fuck up the freys thing almost see belowwhat i am not sure aboutthe new adventures of old dany targaryen okay so blah blah blahâ<U+0080> going to see this guy â<U+0080> blah blah blahâ<U+0080> going to see that guy â<U+0080> blah blah blah â<U+0080> richest man in qarth worked on docks

fucker banggif classbbcemoticon altbang when is this waste of time going to end why do we need to go through this when we know that the dragons will â<U+0080><U+009C>soon be back in her

clash dany has literally 5 chapters in the whole book by contrast tyrion has 15 and in those chapters she does next to nothing until the house of the undying and even there itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s all kinda amorphous and shrouded this really lame kidnapping plot is the only way they can keep dany in the show without making us wonder why she is in the show in the first place i am willing to let this one play out shae didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t suck out loud and make me want to kill puppies brief quick stayed on point not silly dialog and even made a cogent point that shows she is going to eventually betray tyrion perfectly fine i hope i can avoid her for the rest of the season cat stark back in camp i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think i trust this how is robb supposed to make the most boneheaded decision in the book if his mom is constantly around him and warning him i am a little bit uneasy about this what i did not likein defense of my sex look after watching robb stark be around girls and act like an idiot but more importantly theon with osha jon with ygritte and the guard with osha and add to that in prior episodes stannis with mal i just want to say thisyou know that if you simply rub up against a man we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t all turn fucking stupid right i mean watching jon be afraid of a woman moving near him with 18 layers between them seriously if you rub up against a fully clothed man dressed for winter it doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t automatically turn hard and make you want to fuck everything in sight and then watching every ironman look at osha like they were all diabetic and she had the insulin wedged in her tits all i could think of was â<U+0080><U+009C>i would totally fuck thatâ<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>the idea that men are just fucking idiots is totally cool with everyoneâ<U+0080><U+009D> i can understand some things but the guard they just took the castle this guy ainâ<U+0080><U+0099>t thinking â<U+0080><U+009C>there is a chance somebody may try to knife me because that is totally what i would do to them and remember ironborn he knows who asha or yaya or whatever the fuck her name is this guy just thinks every women he just kidnapped wants to fuck himi know its pretty identical to the books but i didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t like it there either i just feel the need to say that all men are not dickled idiots the land of always wasting my time so this is what we are doing with ygritte turning it into a misguided kidnapping where jon snow has to lamely chase her and why is he chasing her why do we need this canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t you just do all this later what the fuck this is empty space wasted time this is time i could be spending watching jaime remember him or stannis or any in a long line of characters who do not make me want to throw my tv into a lakesee in the books we know with one line of dialog why jon didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t kill ygritte we get it he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want to kill a woman got it done simple economy of time the show he strikes on the rock and instead of him saying in a compassionate humane way that would make us all try to empathize with this gigantic walking clicha â<U+0080><U+009C>goâ<U+0080> before i change my mind ygritteâ<U+0080><U+009D> she jumps away and he chases her wtf for   he just let her go why is he chasing somebody he just let go it makes him look indecisive weak confused and wastes our time and it makes no sense at allso instead of making jon snow a human being the show made him an unclear plot devise well done a game of thrones you somehow made me hate jon snow even more than i did in the books and that was no easy feat starting to be like dragon claws on a blackboard and in defense of the other sex just a little bit of advice to the writers not everything that comes out of danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s time wasting mouth has to make her sound crazy okay why does she have to end every sentence with â<U+0080><U+009C>i will burn insert name of area or person here to the groundâ<U+0080><U+009D> its distracting its totally unrealistic and its foolishand this how come every woman we have met in power has to sound like that dany cersei and a little bit with maegery why are we all so cool with women sounding crazy when they are powerful i find it sexist frankly but whatever  iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m the guy who thinks there are some men on the planet that donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think with their dicks here is my point dany does not have to be that focused or crazytalking to be effective not every meeting has to end with her threatening to kill everyone or burn x or y to the ground its really really aggravatingand if everyone in her kalasar is dead and her handmaiden looks dead tooâ<U+0080> it may be nice if she gave a flying fuckâ<U+0080>this was by

"The Sun's Son",2012-05-06,"im guessing danys dragons were taken to the house of the undying"
"Winterfell is Burning",2012-05-06,"opening with the fall of winterfell caught me by surprise i did like alfie allens petulant i took it as if he has to prove it even to branyeah me tooim happy they didnt go much in depth about how exactly winterfell was taken since that was a part i never found very convincing in the booksthought this was a great episode loved theon loved the riot my only complaint is the scene with little finger why is little finger so interested in trying to look at who this cupbearer is it didnt make any sense i get that you want to have some tension but it was over the top seemed like a comedy routinehe was simply thinking do i know this girl from somewhere no problem for me heremy problem however is that he is appearing too much in fact only tyrion and arya have appeared this much lf worked best when he stayed out of sight without you knowing where he is or what the hell he was doing"
"Pliny",2012-05-06,"to me the big wuestion is dagmerramsey how else does bolton know everything that is going on in winterfell luwin sent his message before rodrik was killedwhoa if this is true mindblowni noticed that theon is presented with two paths in the same frame dagmers advice vs maester luwens advice alfie allens acting this week this season has been incredible ser rodricks last words were badasssome questions  i see a few people think littlefinger recognized arya my husband only about 13 through got and i read them all both got the impression that it was tywin who suspected something not that shes arya stark but just that he knows shes more than she says i love the whole aryatywin thing but perhaps its because i already loved tywin and now theyre just making him more likable when i saw aryas smile when he complimented her i anticipated a ragefest over it amongst purists oh well some of us are enjoying it loved jaqens expression when she insists he kill lorch now sansan fans are feasting on his rescue scene and it was good but it seems to me that in this season that the writers are making an effort to lay the foundation for sansatyrion sorry sansan fans"
"AnikaUnderfoot",2012-05-06,"just implied sex this week obviously osha and theon werent jus lying naked in bed together loved theons line when he first sees her naked lolgif classbbcemoticon altlol you are completely rightthat whole scene somehow manage to slip my mind when i was talking about everything else i liked how about we change that to no rosmy apologies edited by anikaunderfoot 06 may 2012  1120 pm"
"Bastard of Boston",2012-05-06,"thought this was a great episode loved theon loved the riot my only complaint is the scene with little finger why is little finger so interested in trying to look at who this cupbearer is it didnt make any sense i get that you want to have some tension but it was over the top seemed like a comedy routinewell arya wasnt helping her cause by trying so hard to remain out of his sightand the fact that she spilled wine all over him contributed to grabbing his attention"
"Lady Olenna",2012-05-06,"ive been holding my criticism on the deviations from the books just to see where the show is going i have to say that i actually enjoy the changes and understand why they chose to do them i think theyve chosen wisely with their deviationsâ the kl scene between tyrion  cersei was absolutely epic viewers probably dont understand the significance of cersei telling tyrion she hopes he loves someone etc and the stare down he gives her readers know that he did truly love someone only to have her taken away if looks could killâ i was floored by naked osha but the change worked to get the kids to the crypts got to see rickon shaggy dog and summer im not sure if i heard it correctly but it sounded like ygritte said that jons brothers had deserted him wonderful foreshadowing of his own desertion the snuggling scene was hilariousâ i like that shae actually has a decent scene but im not sure how they are going to play that out laterâ i know that people dont like jaquens dart but come on the delivery was greatâ and i for one am glad to see more of tywin hes just awesome cant wait to see some jaime scenes coming upâ although i was caught off guard by the dragons  im glad they did it because i always wondered why it never happened in the booksâ great episodeâ"
"RoamingRonin",2012-05-06,"ser rodriks beheading was a interesting change it reminded me of neds execution with bran rickon and the rest watching helpless theons crossed the line now theres no turning back for him and now dany has to back up all of her big talk without her dragons her plot needed a bit of action based drama but where was ser jorah and doreah did the thieves break in or was dany betrayed"
"Ser Joe of House Targaryen",2012-05-06,"are we sure that osha and the stark kids are going to be hiding in the crypts with the way things are going this season i wouldnt be surprised if they just leave winterfell all together and start out towards the wall"
"turdle",2012-05-06,"well arya wasnt helping her cause by trying so hard to remain out of his sightand the fact that she spilled wine all over him contributed to grabbing his attentionsure but even before then he spent almost the entire scene trying to see her face if i were tywin i would have found it very distracting that petyr wasnt paying attention to what i was saying"

"Spooky Scary Jurble",2012-05-06,"you cant possibly still think talisa is talisa from volantis after the scene tonight shes clearly hiding her identity beyond that volantis isnt exactly an integral aspect of the ice and fire series i dont think altering the color palette of its people is all that detrimental to anything its one thing to make dany ravenhaired its pretty inconsequential to make a volantene onewhether she is volantene isnt the issue the fact that rob didnt go bullshit when she stated it based on entirely on her appearance indicates that valyrian looks in the tvshow are probably going to be restricted entirely to targaryens which i hate since it makes targaryens magical or special when they just happen to be a valyrian family that managed to keep their dragons alive"
"AnikaUnderfoot",2012-05-06,"also i did like arya demanding her next kill now the look on jaqens face was like is this girl serious i loved their interactions"

"A Time for Wolves",2012-05-06,"jon and ygritte sigh i just hated almost all of their time together in the books and now he looks even worsei didnt like them in the books but something about tvygritte is endearing maybe ill start to dislike her healthily after the 10th you know nothing jon snow but i right now i like this ygritte a lot right now shes spirited without being obnoxious although maybe the obnoxious part will come out sooni love that the tv show isnt shying away from portraying dany as she really is  her true nature is camouflaged pretty well until asos pretty shocked at seeing her khalasar dead and the dragons stolen but i like this and i wish something like that had happened in the books because it in hindsight it seems really odd that nobody tried itim still lukewarm on talisa  although her being a noblewoman makes this whole thing slightly more plausible i loved the scenes between robb and catelyn so much theyre such a great pair on screenthe taking of winterfell broke my heart on the other hand just as i knew it would and when the bolton betrayal was foreshadowedanother terrible moment edited by a time for wolves 06 may 2012  1142 pm"

"zippypoodle",2012-05-06,"i enjoyed this episode a lot the winterfell scenes were great also very happy to hear that ramsey hasnt entirely been cutim just waiting on the fan rage for the changes particularly danys dragons being stolen i cant wait to read the bitching for a whole weeki was thinking the same thing the analysis from this site has this gemthe stolen dragons completely new the consequences of which are presently rather unfathomable in terms of the show but which does strike a blow at the fidelity of the series with the novels qarth has now radically departed from the narrative in the novellol"

"zippypoodle",2012-05-06,"i definitely agree with this i cant say i dislike this season because it has been amazing at times but i feel that they are just diverging from the books way too far this season compared to last season i hope they pull it back a little closer as we get further in the season but i really doubt it willseriously there have been very few changes of any importance at all yes i will admit the dragontheft is going a bit far afield but even that doesnt stray all that far from the path and will likely give dany even more reason to torch the hotu so im content to wait and see where that goesbut for everything else hardly any changes at all im absolutely throwing out any concerns like subbing bronn for bywater or complaints about minor character a dying instead of minor character b theyre not even worth consideringfor the other storylines tonight1 the taking of winterfell was almost exactly from the books and osha escapes with bran and rickon just like from the books rodrik instead of the hound master irrelevant osha doing theon instead of some other minor character irrelevant2 jon captures ygritte and lets her go pretty much exactly the same and it will still lead to jon killing qhorin to prove he betrayed the nights watch3 the harrenhall scenes are pretty much true to the spirit of the book and dont go anywhere it can be claimed to be such a big departure that the storyline from the books cannot be followed4 the kings landing scenes especially the riot were exactly from the books with changes that could only annoy the nitpickiest of book purists sansa was rescued from her horse not from three rapists grr"

"House Snow",2012-05-06,"i dont understand the complaints about dany grrm made her seem way way more petulent nieve and incompetant in the books in some ways i think the show is showing it better than george was where it seemed so heavy handed but i am just a young girl that merchant scene was a nice merge of the litany of dany is nieve scenes also put me in the xxd is somehow involved with the kidnapping scene his reaction was very much delayed plus he was just talking about his willingness to do anything to get what he wants in retrospect the scene is set up well bc you wonder if it was warlocks xxd jorah or doreah who set it up"

"WeirwoodTreeHugger",2012-05-07,"i am so very relieved to hear a ramsay mention i wondered too how roose would have known about rodericks death this dagmer  ramsay theory is intriguing it solves the problem of the winterfell storylne with reek being absent dagmer is acting very iagoish talking theon into being even more of a douche if dagmer is the one to suggest executing bran and rickon i will be very on board with this theory it would be such a fun twist that would shock book readers too is anyone else wondering when sansa is meeting dontos in the godswood iirc she had already started doing this a long time ago in the book maybe it wont be until next season hopefully these theories about olenna being cut are wrong she is too great to be denied i will be pissed if alfie allen and maisie williams dont get award noms for this season they are so fantastic"

"Morrigan",2012-05-07,"well i was expecting more negative reactions to be honest yes im a bit of a book purist book what book lol but i dont mind changes when they are smart andor wellwritten most of those in this episode really really werent for instance i enjoyed tywin and aryas interactions in the 5th episode i could list examples of other changes i thought made sense andor that i enjoyed but to save time ill just nerdrage about how stupid this episode was overall i want an adaptation of the novels i loved not a goddamn fanfiction facepalmthat was how he died in the book as well ripped apart by the mobyeah but i always assumed he was just trampled to death or beaten up by a lynch mob that whole zombielike ripping scene was beyond cheesy and retarded a human arm just doesnt get torn off like that for crying out loud when the mob started snarling like zombies i snorted in derision and thought whats this a romero movie when the arm came off i just had to laugh idioticspeaking of cheesy gore while i enjoyed sandor trouncing those wouldbe rapists i mean its hard to not enjoy the hound kicking ass the guts spilling out was just stupid gore like that belongs in a zombie flick not game of thrones it looked goofy and cartoonish haha are u serious so just because shes hotter oh my god thats fucking retarted and no the actress who played irri was a good actress and she said in an interview that irris death came as a shock and she was free to do game of thronesretarded indeed i feel for that actress there was no need to cut her especially considering there was a dead handmaiden in the series and her name was doreah instead they kill off the brown girl in a completely retarded scene to boot and keep doreah alive because because fuck you is why best episode yet i honestly do not understand how someone can say these changes were negative by doing so youre basically just claiming that grrms story is completely perfect and cannot be altered whatsoever in any way yes thats what were claiming really oh wait no bugger offi just get the feeling that the show does not know why we all liked the books so much i mean itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not â<U+0080><U+009C>youcanâ<U+0080><U+0099>timproveonperfectionâ<U+0080><U+009D> or anything like that more like that scene in annie hall i just want to be standing in line and pull out george rr martin and have him say â<U+0080><U+009C>you know nothing about my workâ<U+0080><U+009D>agreed thank you and thank you for pointing out the sheer idiocy of the jonygritte scene oh my fucking god that was retarded and pointless and nerdrage inducing you know i get that the show needs to cut to adapt blah blah blah budget constraint tv format etc but nothing nothing whatsoever justified this change it was not only longer than it needed to be it made no sense the only reason i can think of is to make jon look like a complete fucktard ughanother needless addon osha sleeping with theon just more gratuitous nudity again it wasnt necessary to her plot to spirit the boys out of winterfell she could just have waited for theon to be asleep normally and do all the rest but that way there would be no bewbies derpand then there was danys dragons being stolen what i mean seriously what why why why perfect example of change for the sake of change and dont tell me its to give dany something to do dany already had plenty of reasons to visit the house of the undying this was just supremely lazy writing to artificially add tension and a cliffhanger to the episode and so badly done too they come back to the mansion and all those dothraki warriors are dead and yet there isnt a single slain foe in sight derp and wheres doreah oh probably getting naked somewhere duhalso the whole dany needs something to do notion needs to die dany has 5 chapters in acok so what we hardly see jaime either or barristan we dont see lysa at all til the end of asos theon is not at all in a storm of swords they already gutted brans storyline why would they need to add to danys it will be inevitable that some actorscharacters have fewer appearances or screen time for prolonged periods of time due to how the story is written or are you people gonna encourage them to invent arbitrary storylines for theon in season 3 when we all know that he does nothing except being tortured and broken by ramsay and i dread to see what will happen with robb there was nothing wrong with him taking an arrow wound getting feverish and being nursed to health by jeyne it made sense and also catelyn wasnt around to remind him of his duty they made that storyline just far less believable already i was really looking forward to the house of the undying because i figured it was their opportunity to show flashbacks and visions but now im dreading the whole thing i have no reason to trust in the writers and i am expecting the whole thing to suck hey that way i wont be disappointed and if im wrong ill be pleasantly surprisedthis was by far the weakest episode of the seasonimo it was the weakest of the entire series so far by fardid you notice how littlefinger kept staring at arya i dont remember him being into little girls in the books but suddenly thats his thing in the show its really unlike him imo but there you goerr no facepalm he was checking her out because she obviously looked familiar to him and he was probably wondering where he saw her before geez the real problem with this scene actually is twofold one littlefinger can apparently teleport seriously hes everyfuckingwhere hes obviously dds favourite character because his screen time is ludicrously high and hes inserted into a bunch of random scenes and places where he never appeared in the books just because enough already and second while i enjoy charles dance and the tywinarya interactions were entertaining they were completely out of character tywin confiding in his cupbearer is just absurd and while arya screaming now at jaqen and jaqens raised eyebrows made for decent humour the way ser amory died was just ridiculous and farfetched i wonder if therell be any followup to that i mean an important bannerman of tywin was murdered just like that i hope there will be consequences at least but now im no longer holding my breath for any weasel soup hound redemption the only thing that saved this episodewell that and the mention of the bastard of the dreadfort i just really thought the sack of winterfell along w ser rodricks beheading and the kings landing riots were cheesy as hell this was my least favorite boarding on worst episode everand im usually not that much of a complainer i usually defend the visual representation of the novels but this one was just plain bad disappointedagreed with the last sentence at least but i wish people wouldnt call it the sack of winterfell it wasnt a sack it was a capture the sackingburning comes later at ramsays hand also i thought winterfells capture and the riot were by far the least offensive parts of the episode you should stop watching the show also you clearly need to get laidwow what a great jab you sure showed him rolleyesgif classbbcemoticon

"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2012-05-07,"i dont mind the change to danys storyline they have to give her a little extra something to do im fine with that im sure shell still end up at the same place as the books her storyline in acok was kinda boring so they wanted to add some excitement im fine with that plus it never made sense that no one ever tried to steal her dragons so having at least one attempt will get that out of the way and we wont have to hear how come nobody ever tried to steal her dragons when they were little my complaint about this episode is that the dialogue was a bit off especially the robbjeyne conversation it just didnt work for me i also felt that the whole killing of lorch scene was silly surely tywin would be tearing the entire castle apart looking for a killer in their midst instead he acts as if nothing happened edited by the scabbard of the morning 07 may 2012  0253 am"

"LordofWinter",2012-05-07,"is it just me or are they trying to make you feel sorry for theon on the show in the books he came off as a prick but in the show it is like he is the victim maybe it is just me any thoughtsi agree as well but i think they are doing this and have been for quite some time with a lot of characters and im not certain whether that is due to the writers personal interpretation of the books or that dd thought that they needed to amp up the sympathy for certain characters im probably alone in this thought but i think that alot of the changes are made to the benefit of certain characters image in reference to the possible fans of the show ie cat they have changed alot of catelyns decisions and actions to make the viewer more sympathetic to her ned leaving for kl went from her urging it to her seeming rightfully soworried and sad about it her not saying to jon it should have been you going to see renly stops being her idea and becomes robbs to make her appear to of being pushed away by her children also prevents her from going home like she wanted to instead of it not occurring to her to go home and take care of her sons sansa sansa is a little girl who tends to take a lot of flack from fans of the book series so i wasnt too surprised when they started to combine her story with lollys i always found that when reading the books it was harder for me to feel sorry for sansa whilst she shared a castle with lollys who was a little girl as well but lifeand this story had been much more cruel to her i mean you feel bad when joff gets ser meryn to strip san at court and again when she gets attacked at the riot but you stop feeling so bad when you remember that poor dim lollys was left to be raped and almost murdered so by removing lollys completely and having sansa almost get raped you earn her some extra sympathy while saving costs on casting theon plain and simple in the books it is almost impossible to feel sorry for theon the turncloak but in the series you genuinely feel sorry for him at times especially when ser rodrik says to him may the gods bless you soul boy for now you are truly lost the look on theons face is saddening as you can see all happiness drain out of him though they have stayed mostly true to the story with theonjamie there have been a few extra scenes either with or talking about jamie lannister and most of them tend to provide a better window into who jamie lannister really is his scene with robb in the first episode i found really great and finding out from tywin that jamie had dyslexia was a big shock for meincidentally it also showed that tywin wasnt the absentee father we all thought strict and stubborn yes but you cant take away the credit of a great lord who spends four hours a day trying to help his son rid himself of his learning deficiency cersei oh dear god they are really trying to calm down the crazy bitch that the books depicted her to be though maybe they are just building up to it but so they been keen on turning joff into a young charles manson in order to make her not look as sadistic by reflection and changing who ordered the killing of roberts bastards was a huge change in my opinion because that was when i as a reader really began to understand just how ambitious sick cersei could be but hey im probably what is referred to as a book purest even though i deny it i just truly enjoyed the books and thought it would be nice if i could watch a series based on them but as a friend of mine who has never read the books because he doesnt want to ruin the show for himself said to me dude youre a fan of the a song of ice and fire series thats cool but remember youre not watching a song of ice and fire youre watching a game of thrones so while they may be similar they are not the same thing so accept that they are different entities and start seeing them as such and your expectations of the show can go back to just being that you want it to be entertaining which in my opinion is great advice i only found the book series because he told me about the show so after watching the first seasonand fucking loving it i burned through 5 books and then decided that i now hate my new favourite show because they keep changing thingsand that is my late night rantoh and jaqens face when arya is freaking out saying that it has to be done now is hilarious you can just see him in his head going ugh little girls are so tiresome"

"templar7",2012-05-07,"glad to hear ramsay will be in it but as a purist this season has been painful the show only uses the books as a guideline now dont say its because of budget last season stayed very close to the books and a lot of plotsscenes have been added most of the dialogue in the show now never happened in the booksif you are a true purist then why watch im relieved that i dont know whats going to happen next and most of the changes they have made still fit and keep it moving in most cases i think they are imrovements its an adaptation not a copy i love the books too dont get me wrong but the sooner i accepted this as a new telling i started liking it more and more the best thing about the books is their unpredictability and the show has it too"

"Dragon of Valyria",2012-05-07,"okay so in relatively chronological order as far as i can remember the attack on winterfell was great i never really liked bran and always felt he was boring in the books but i wanted to stand up and applaud him for his totally contemptuous treatment of theon his reactions to ser rodriks death were also great hempsteadwright is amping up his game and i really hope he can stay on with the show even as he gets older   hes doing a fantastic job as much as i loathe everything about theon allen really played him quite well especially the way his mouth quivered after bran asked him if he had hated them the whole time leslies doing great as ygritte but the whole chase thing was a pointless waste of time like somebody else mentioned i also for a second thought wed get you know nothing when she said youre stupid alas soon i hope the riot gods i was honestly terrified at first i was like oh thisll be some good fun and humiliation for joffreybut then sansas scene got a lot more intense and i was getting worried by the chase and then she was cornered in a room with nowhere to go i honestly thought they were actually going to have her raped i really did turner just sold it heart pounding full of nervous fear for my favorite charactergreat acting great camera work and a near heart attack from me i am floored at how graphicclose to an actual rape that they got tensest moment on a tv show for me ive never been the hounds biggest fan but he literally arrived at the last second to save the day somebody give him a ing medal and another joffrey slap yes still concerned about talisa i dont honestly think shes really volantene but the fact that both catelyn and robb could buy it is troubling but not totally problematic just as every targaryen didnt have the valyrian look nor should every single member of the volantene aristocracy youd think somebody would at least ask though im disturbed by tywin being so forthcoming to his cupbearer i dont mind them developing him but the man was the biggest snob in the seven kingdoms remember what he did to poor tysha come on he wouldnt be so chatty with someone he thought a commoner im fine with him finding her amusing but not telling her family stories maisie williams did a fantastic job with the littlefinger scene thoughthese child actors are phenominal the daenerys scenes ill wait and see what happens with the dragonnapping before commenting i dont mind her being more assertive about her throne and her rights some people might see it as crazy and it is a little perhaps but i like it i also liked the spice king contrasting his way of life with hers different worlds most people would probably say he knocked her down a peg but id say he just proved himself to be a smallminded fool shaes scene with sansa was great development for both characters done in an artful way"

"sennahoj",2012-05-07,"i loved this episode the storylines were juggled nicely and the episode just flew by the changes worked for me the taking of winterfell really surprised me as a starter but it was a really intense chapter especially for theon the only thing that felt a bit rushed there was that they put the apparent escape from winterfell in the same episode at harrenhal the tywinarya interactions might be out of character for tywin but they help explain why arya doesnt choose tywin for her next victim for the show it made sense to have littlefinger negotiate the lannistertyrell alliance on both ends but since we have no real measure of time passing on the show it really feels as if hes everywhere great introduction of ygritte although they expanded it quite a bit and deviated from the book but in my opinion the great icelandic vistas made it all worthwhile the riot scene and the aftermath were great especially tyrion still in shock and in dwarfrage at the same time and of course the hound my only gripe with this is that apparently all horses in kings landing have already been eaten why would the kings procession be on foot okay budget animals on set all difficult to handle but no horses at all finally danys storyline got a twist which i really liked stealing the dragons is a major deviation from the books but seeing as everyone wants her dragons it still seems plausible saving her children from the warlocks adds to the urgency for the mother of dragons to go there also i was under the impression that they pitched the dragons screams to sound a bit like crying babies or am i imagining things in my opinion strongest episode so far"

"ace",2012-05-07,"the dragon stealing was probably the biggest departure from the books so far my first thought was that it was the warlocks though what was that tower could that be the house of the undying i see they decided to portray robbs affair with jayne of course that makes no sense book robb married her because he slept with her the whole point was that it was a spur of the moment thing by portraying this as a long affair the show makes robb look stupid he knows he shouldnt betray the freys and still he does it makes the rw almost well deserved same with jon the whole point of his defection was that qhorin ordered him to go with them and do whatever they asked of him now hes apparently lost with ygrette and she takes him to mance herself seeing tywin lannister hand of the king warden of the west the queens father richest and most powerful man in all the seven kingdoms doing psychotherapy sessions with a 10 year old lowborn servant girl was bizarre to say the least i know this is hollywood but at least try to make the show look believable the best parts of the episode were no doubt in winterfell it was interesting to see how theon is pressured by his men into becoming a tyrant in the book it kinda came natural to him i probably prefer this version though i will now not be able to hate this theon with quite the same passion only complaints i have besides the obvious ones about shortening every scene are rodrick apparently going from winterfell to torrhens square retaking it then coming back at the same time that it took theon to get to winterfell once and theon started earlier might be a nitpick but its this kind of things that hurt the immersion in the story and wheres boltons bastard without him there will have to be major changes to theons story too"

"Shienberg",2012-05-07,"my 002 i definately fall in the best episode yet this season camp i have concerns but i enjoy the show greatly obviously there are more deviations from the book this season compared to last i respect the rightneed to make some changes for television my only complaint is that they are jarring they take me out of the story for a moment when i think wait that didnt happen that said i think there are some situations where people take it too far nitpicking details like they were on horsees and other situations were i agree things are unnecessary like the jon chases ygritte scene i love love love this show same with the books but they are two different things for me its just important that they get the major touchstones right they havent failed yet but there are things i am concerned about weasel soup is the nearest of those concerns on the horizon but more about the epi i agree with those who say that theon is much more sympathetic in the show than the books in the books i didnt truly start to like him until he lept from the walls of winterfell in the show you see the characters conflicted loyalties much more clearly maybe its the actor but regardless i look forward to theon scenes while in the book his chapters where not the ones i was overjoyed about similar with sansa for some reason i find her much more interesting in the show her silent patient struggle is much more compelling on the screen than on the page wait sidetrack the epi the capture of winterfell was well done all around no problem with roderick tacking the many hacked beheading some things just have to be condensed and yes the look on theons face after was priceless man poor rickon is gonna be one messed up little shit by the time davos gets to him the things this kid has seen and been through i still laugh thinking about him cracking nuts last week loved the riot scene although it didnt seem as desperate or chaotic as in the books im not sure what i liked better the hounds rescue of sansa or tyrion chewing out joff joff is certainly a viscious idiot i become more and more ok with the roosetywin switch everytime arya and tywin are on screen some say oh he would never talk to a cupbearer since we dont get a tywin pov im not sure anyone truly has that much insight to his personality i do however hate the way littlefinger is frickin everywhere if hes traveling all across westeros how the hell is he arranging sansas escape with dontos which by the way is sorely missing there has been no establishment of a godswood in kl nor of sansa praying why intro dontos in the first ep and then throw him in a closet til next year anyway way to much littlefinger and not enough varys in my opinion yes the nurse girl form volantis will be jeyne westerling im suprised robb didnt say hello mother nice to see you and by the way who is that giant woman dressed like a knight who seems to be following you you would think it would spark some curiosity i got giddy as a schoolgirl when roose suggested sending his bastard to take back winterfell my only problem with aryas kill 2 is that her attitude the way she commanded jaqen and her carelessness in stealing the note in the first place do not seem like qualities that would make him want to send her off to the faceless men for training on screen though the way they did the scene i thought it made good tv one last gripe in that big open northern waste qhorin had left jon like two minutes before ygritte ran off they would still be like right there when he was chasing her ok 2 last gripes why hasnt the open ing map taken us beyond the wall to the fist of the first men seems silly not to as we approach the end of the season i am looking forward to the arrival of arstan whitebeard and strong belwas but i am wondering how the will desguise ser barristan for the tv audience since obviously we will be able to see him great epi great show"

"Nebmai",2012-05-07,"very good episode one of the best this season here was the highlights  the dog being the disgruntled boss of violence introducing the san  san thing more really entertaining later on especially highlighting the awesome difference between arya and sans as seen in book 3 stop thinking of ways to kill me in my sleep wolf girl vs sing me a song little bird someone is danys base killing her doodz stealing her dragonz good handling of getting the winterfell escape in a compressed format it seemed to fit in naturally even though it was rushed overall tonks boobs yup the best part actually was useful to the plot not too gratuitous though a welcome way to fill this weeks boob quotient the direction of ygritte seemed good already teasing  starting to pursue jon the hip thing evil smile was hilarious the bastard of bolton incoming run seriously gtfo lock up your daughters such a good creepy uber villain character which will be needed after the purple wedding arya yelling at jaqen then the way they cut it to the darting seriously made me laugh out loud the littlefinger scene was an interesting little twist they did a good job on the riot stop whining about horses using them would of been really expensive and dangerous and it didnt take away any from the scene this and epsiode 3 were my favorites from season two so far"
"DarkSnow",2012-05-07,"the dragon stealing was probably the biggest departure from the books so far my first thought was that it was the warlocks though what was that tower could that be the house of the undyingi see they decided to portray robbs affair with jayne of course that makes no sense book robb married her because he slept with her the whole point was that it was a spur of the moment thing by portraying this as a long affair the show makes robb look stupid he knows he shouldnt betray the freys and still he does it makes the rw almost well deservedsame with jon the whole point of his defection was that qhorin ordered him to go with them and do whatever they asked of him now hes apparently lost with ygrette and she takes him to mance herselfseeing tywin lannister hand of the king warden of the west the queens father richest and most powerful man in all the seven kingdoms doing psychotherapy sessions with a 10 year old lowborn servant girl was bizarre to say the least i know this is hollywood but at least try to make the show look believablethe best parts of the episode were no doubt in winterfell it was interesting to see how theon is pressured by his men into becoming a tyrant in the book it kinda came natural to him i probably prefer this version though i will now not be able to hate this theon with quite the same passion only complaints i have besides the obvious ones about shortening every scene are rodrick apparently going from winterfell to torrhens square retaking it then coming back at the same time that it took theon to get to winterfell once and theon started earlier might be a nitpick but its this kind of things that hurt the immersion in the story and wheres boltons bastard without him there will have to be major changes to theons story tooi still think it will be a spur of the moment thing in the episode he knew that he had a duty to fulfill his word to the freys so it likely that he sleeps with her after hearing that theon has killed bran and rickon as in the books and marrys her to protect her honor"
"Seed",2012-05-07,"thought this was a great episode loved theon loved the riot my only complaint is the scene with little finger why is little finger so interested in trying to look at who this cupbearer is it didnt make any sense i get that you want to have some tension but it was over the top seemed like a comedy routineit was obvious that arya was trying to hide her face thats what piqued his interest esp after he got a half a glimpse he knew who she was"
"David Selig",2012-05-07,"weakest episode of the season imo too many wtf scenes not because they were changed from the books but because they made very little sense jons chase of ygritte was just ridiculous just as the later scene with them lying next to each other rockroi explained perfectly why sansa suddenly trusting and treating shae like a close friend when the last time we saw those two she hated her and thought she was a spy dany thinking that a few ships are all she needs to take the iron throne littlefinger and arya scene theyve really made him totally incompetent at anything besides brothel management this season  all of this was poorly written some good moments of course  the riot the winterefell scenes michelle fairley being awesome as usual but overall i was disappointed rose leslies acting was great a shame they didnt give her some decent lines instead of all that nonsense edited by david selig 07 may 2012  0626 am"

"Sun",2012-05-07,"loved this episode my only issues with it are robb  talysa scene idiotic writing straight out of a hackneyed hollywood romance they need to fix their interactions and make them more credible or they will really affect the toe of the show amory lorches death a farcical moment that felt so out of tune with the episode im sure they meant for it to come off as shocking they faild it was laughable and somehow made the supposedly very real peril arry is under less crediblethats it really i like with changes to danys arc i hated her arc in the books and found the fact that no one at any moment ever attempted to steal her tiny baby dragons very hard to believe edited by sun 07 may 2012  0933 am"

"rmanoj",2012-05-07,"i didnt think this episode was up to par the winterfell and kl scenes were quite well done although im not sure whats supposed to have happened to ser rodriks army  were they all crushed at torrhens square but some of the changes are completely pointless myrcella crying when the book specifically made a point of her not crying this feels like the writer is trying to stick it to grrm or something for no reason at all i have no idea where theyre going with the ygritte thing i hope it doesnt end up being something stupid  like jon actually deserting or ending up with mance because of her these bits are important for his character and they cant afford to mess it up harrenhalsome nicely acted scenes sure but the amory lorch stuff just seems to be there for a cheap thrill and tywin is being randomly warm and open to his suspicious cupbearer littlefinger littlefinger everywhere he is really getting on my nerves edited by rmanoj 07 may 2012  0657 am"
"Rhodan",2012-05-07,"seeing theon taking winterfell and beheading rodrik was great and depressing it was like reading one of those asoiaf books  still it was a little strange that rodrik was totally alone as it seemed can somebody tell me why this episode was titled as it was i canât remember hering the phrase or even seeing the theme anyway while it wasnât the worst thing ever on tv i think i simply dislike style of vanessa taylor she seems to be enjoying writing what she sees as witty dialogue of such characters as tywinarya talisarobb or danyspice king but sometimes it looks like sort of parody which quite undermines seriousness of established characters she is really kinda trying to put some new humor here and there and it rarely works to be honest about the story itself only theon part and kidnapping of dragons seemed to me somehow consequential i liked kl riot but i would prefer character stuff as sansadontos and such"
"Loras",2012-05-07,"i think aiden gillen must have the best agent on the show how on earth does he get to appear in every episode when more central characters miss episodes i bet he appears in highgarden next week too much littlefinger other than that this was a fantastic episode"
"Kaitscralt",2012-05-07,"what did the letter say that arya took also unless jaqen took it back wouldnt tywin know that arya took it"
"Mendoza",2012-05-07,"i really dont have much issue with many of the changes i like the idea of the dragons being used to lure danny into the house of the undying i thought the stuff arya faced was a great way to force out her second kill i also think tywin knows who she is and is amused by her lies of course if so hes a much kindlier jailer than his crazy family in kings landing the robb romance stuff is straight out of bad 2 star romance movie ill agree with that"
"Dracarya",2012-05-07,"now im a bit more coherent ill give more of my thoughts  like i said very happy that ramsay was mentioned hes an evil bastard but necessary to the story imho  i loved how bran looked at theon when he first said hed taken winterfell kinda like bitch please lolgif classbbcemoticon altlol  all the scenes there were amazing despite some tiny changes osha was brilliant and when they sneaked out at the end i was like dont forget the wolves thankfully they were behind them  theon killing ser rodrik was awful but such a good scene very powerful  danys storyline has changed quite a lot but someone stealing her dragons and imo taking them to the hotu isnt a change i have much of a problem with i like how everything that happens to her is undermining her making her prove herself  the spice lord was so condescending towards her i think it shows that yeah she might have dragons but shes still a young girl and she has to earn what she wants much more believable i like it not sure why irri was killed though  her khalasar is shrinking to nothing i wonder if doreah as in on the theft of the dragons interesting  talisa is one change i dont like if they end up making her a lannister spy and it comes out that shes jeyne westerling well i dont know how that would work robb would never marry her after that so maybe they do the deed get married and then it comes out but shes fallen in love with him during that time im waiting to see on that one but so far im unimpressed the best thing about that scene was the looks catelyn was giving her  arya and tywin were great despite the deviation from the books charles dance just nails it so i cant complain too much i liked the amory lorch scene it showed the same kind of mindset that arya had in the book  kill those who are immediately threatening her all in all best episode so far as an adaptation its getting worse but im trying to save myself some disappointment by just watching the show as its own thing like i did with dexter i hope they dont deviate as far as dexter did but most of what theyre doing differently works"
"ServantOnIce",2012-05-07,"1 it is obvious that doreah betrayed dany she was tired of being a harlotslave and wanted money and freedom that was an inside job as her body wasnt amongst the slain2 i hated they have killed off danys khalaasar sp it was an important part of the decisions she made good ones and bad ones in the books and now they are almost all gone except for a handful also seems like dany wont be having serviced scenes that are in storm and dragons i thought those were unnecessary in the books3 so it seems like they are really for budget and time dumping a lot of stuff also to keep the tv audience from being more confused than i am sure they are4 stealing the dragons is lame seeing dead unsullied and dead dothraki was a shock it seems that grrm wants to shock and awe book readers again by allowing d and d to achieve more fan fiction5 they have greatly departed from the books ser rodrik was killed by lord ramsay snow but to show theons arc they showed theon killing someone who trained him at arms sort of like anakin skywalker killing the young padawans in revenge of the sith6 i liked the osha scene but it was predictable again sex scenes arent my thing that is why i have a remote7 the littlefinger arya scene was forced i enjoyed the banter between lord tywin and arya it seems to me that lord tywin knows who arya is but is playing with her until his suspicions are confirmedbad departure in some ways good in others ive never seen a harry potter movie so all the hp folks are freaking out after seeing her neekid calm down folks it wasnt porn yessh  "

"Versiroth",2012-05-07,"glad to hear ramsay will be in it but as a purist this season has been painful the show only uses the books as a guideline now dont say its because of budget last season stayed very close to the books and a lot of plotsscenes have been added most of the dialogue in the show now never happened in the booksmost of the changes this season have been to spice it up nothing really happens in the dany story so they added her dragons being stolen to make it more entertaining same with jon and craster and now john and ygritte most of the changes like these make perfect sense for tv as they are more entertaining than the scenes in the book"

"sagaz",2012-05-07,"as for tywin  very similar views here its not that i dislike the tywin scenes but i do call into question whether it really is tywin lannister showing respect and interest to a servant this is the guy who had a full barracks of men rape a woman his son married because she was simply not royalty in order to embed a sense of discrimination in his son tywins message  there are rulers and there are ruled and if you are a ruler then any woman not of royalty is a whore after your riches and this is to make sure you never make the mistake of bridging that divide so yes there is grey in asoiaf but different shades of grey tywin was a very prejudiced man and that makes perfect sense given the inevitably hierarchical medieval machiavellian setting he lived in and i do think people should appreciate that or at the very least be exposed to it that system of oligarchical conquest persisted for a while it didnt change much until the rapid advances in the economy and in weapon technology which created less incentive and a sort of deterrent to nonstop conquest no longer needed to plunder others to have enough natural resources and the risk was higher and also decentralized protection protection which peasants formerly heavily relied on the ruling class to providethere are these notions we often have of uncivilized racist classist or sexist just being an unfortunate happenstance of the past rather than realizing their existence and early development were pretty much inevitable and logical outcomes given historical context i feel like the bookauthor strongly embodies this sentiment which i think ultimately represents appreciating grey in all the charactersnot this everybody has a good heart rubbish that seems to be a common tv series pitch these daysso yeah id like to see ygritte and tywin a little less endearing the way they were in the books tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp doubt many will read this but feel free to pm me if you disagreeyoure missing the point that they are trying to depict tywin as someone who values intelligence above other things hes in harrenhal an awful place surrounded by ignorants lords or wathever and this girl is the only viable interlocutor he can find i dont saying it in a nostalgicromantic way its merely practical an educated man who needs good conversationthey did a very subtle and good job depicting how important is being intelligent to him that he tells how he sits with jaime 4 hours a day to make him read a nice contrast between his love for jaime the apparently perfect son who cant learn who cant read and his hate for brilliant tyrion who has the intelligence that he admires this contrast is really interesting"

"Lady Octarina",2012-05-07,"that was a great episode even though we had no stannis it reminded me of just how much i hated theon before ramsay made me pity him how much of a little piece of sh he was i also absolutely adored how delirious and stupidly megalomaniac daenerys already sounded this episode something i only truly felt in asos and mostly adwd oh and the spice merchants condescending tone was just priceless lol i love that guy i dont know how to feel about the dragons being stolen yet but was that tower the house of the undying and was it my impression or is arya actually beginning to like tywin cant really blame her and thumbs up for this show for showing just how great their dynamics would be nat tena is simply perfect as osha no wonder grrm wants to expand the characters role based on her acting i love the animalistic aura she gives the character and rodrik truly the saddest death so far maybe even sadder than neds where the show is concerned but thats only until season 3 or 4 kills my favorite dornish of course and really does littlefinger have to appear so much like a noob this season i wonder if martin approves it and if he does if that could be considered a clue to his general incompetence in the last two books watching him this season destroys all my illusions the same way reading cerseis chapters in affc did oh and i liked what they did to that crucial scene in kl with all the alterations i dont think it would have been easy to use horses on that scene like in the book i also think it was a good idea to change slightly the attack on sansa builds up the tension for a moment i actually thought shed be the new lollys and the septon ugh"

"Howdyphillip",2012-05-07,"with few exceptions this season i have agreed with this websites analysis of episodes whether i have agreed or disagreed they have always been poignant insightful and great to read this weeks edition is no exception to the latter but i have an almost diametrically opposed outlook on the episode itself starting with the sack of winterfell i was with this scene the entire way until the emergence of ser rodrik cassel it was well shot well written and emotionally engaging the entire way the problem i had was the content there is a huge difference in my mind of killing a mouthy commoner and executing the man who helped raise theon and trained him how to use a sword it is absolutely plot essential that the character of theon greyjoy becomes redeemed for the future of this series by eliminating the reek character to take the blame for the majority of the dastardly actions is going to make it that much harder for the television audience to do i do console myself with the fact that there have been other changes made to the character that makes this a bit more possible i dont really like the setting of iceland as the backdrop for north of the wall it is too barren for me to believe that there are 100000 wildlings living off the land it also looks like a miserable place to film that is good in the sense that on screen we can see that the characters are actually cold but because of this i also get the impression that they arent able to give their best performances dialogue just feels rushed in these scenes and i dont blame the actors it is freezing out side in this location i personally would rather have seen north of the wall left in last years location of ireland the main complaint that i hear about these scenes with john snow and ygritte i had no problem with though yes it is a change from the book but as of this episode it doesnt take away from either of the characters i have no problem with john running after a fleeing wildling we only have so much room in the tv series and the meat of the story here is snows relationship with the wildlings and ygrette as for why ghost didnt chase her with john my question would be if you had trained your animal wouldnt you have given it a command to unleash it on someone as he was running after her to capture it makes perfect sense to me that he wouldnt have called his direwolf to do a job that he himself had decided that he wasnt going to do i also particularly liked the scene where ygrette was teasing john i thought it was a brilliant way of showing physically the struggles that snow went through in his head that we just can not be privy to in the medium of film i took no issue with harrenhall at all i liked the mix up in communication for several reasons it highlighted that tywin was surrounded by incompetents in the war this was not extolled upon in the books as we didnt have a pov in his camp but it must have been happening for him to have lost so many battles decisively it also again gave us the opportunity to realize that arya is incredibly sharp witted i particularly liked the humanization of tywin as a man who loved his children but was hard as stone i think that arya saw a little bit of her own father in him and i think that fits perfectly with the theme that there are no heroes or villains in this world as a reader i obviously had the foreknowledge that arya was not going to be discovered by littlefinger the vast majority of people watching this show have not read the books and i thought that this scene built up a bit of suspense for them i also thought that the urgent need to use her second name was a clever way of getting rid of it i can see the point that no other gaurds helped lorch in trying to detain arya but it did not immediately pop out to me as particularly egregious i didnt even realize it until that had been pointed out since i have nothing to say about the riot of kings landing except that it was absolutely brilliant in every aspect of my mind i will wrap this up with quarth from reading the books i never got the impression that the entire city was supposed to be other worldly the quarth in my mind doesnt look too terribly different from the one that i am being shown i did get the sense that the house of the undying was like a 70s acid trip but the rest of quarth just seemed to be filled with people of ambition i personally liked danys interaction with the spice lord it showed her as a naive youth but also as a person who had the potential to come into serious power and leadership abilities it justifies her journey later as we as viewers know that she has to mature as far as the dragons go this is just another example of john getting clobbered across the head by craster it wont mean anything in the long run"

"sarah.jenice",2012-05-07,"stolen dragons those damn warlocks great twist away from the books i also love the arya and tywin interactions their personalities mesh and this is an improvement from the books in my opinion im also interested to see if ramsey burns winterfledt as soon as he takes it over or robbs marrying that foreign girls springs it its also interesting they arent setting up tywin using the westerling daughter to drive a wedge between the north and the freyon the dragons my immediate reaction was that it was xaro they had that long delay with the spice king and since dany is in his house he was the first one i thought of in the book xaro has zero interest in helping dany conquer the seven kingdoms so the show has got to make him do something to betray her or it will make no sense that she doesnt accept his perfect offer of ships and tons of money to help her reclaim the iron throneon robbs woman i think their scene tonight had a lot of clues in it i think she is jeyne westerling and her story about being from volantis is completely made up robb notices that she is highborn and catelyn notices that her family is completely fake i also think her line about sending information on robbs troop movements to the lannisters was really telling i think they are going to perhaps make her a full blown spy for the lannisters she was writing a letter which as we saw with arya indicates noble birth and her joke about it being information for the lannisters just struck me as true she definitely folded it up quickly so that robb and catelyn couldnt get a look at it also in the scene with tywin talking about how they are going to defeat robb he clearly laid out that they wont beat him in battle and that they need to find out a way to make him fail we know that failure happens with the red wedding and i think in the same way margery tyrell is a combination of her character and her scheming grandmother jeyne could be a combination of her and her mother making jeyne the mole who reported to tywin and worked to take robb down"

"Northern Girl 30",2012-05-07,"that episode was amazing i loved when the hound saved sansa from those men and said the little bird is bleeding someone take her back to her cage there was only two parts of the episode i didnt really like1 i didnt like the way amory lorch died it was a funny scene and everything but kind of dumb2 i rolled my eyes when dany started saying i am daenerys stormborn mother of dragons i will take what is mine with fire and blood blah blah blah dany weve heard it a hundred times already you can shut up nowthe way dany is talking youd think shes going to sail for westeros next episode or somethingi agree is she is supposed to be this bratty or its the way the actress emilia is depicting her"

"pleonasm",2012-05-07,"i have really mixed feeling about this episode i thought the winterfell scenes were particulary strong although i was wondering why this entire section of storyline was compressed into a single episode of all the stories from clash this one could have easily been extended over seasons 2 and 3 to provide some more time for some of the other plotlines danys story is a real mess i am not suprised as it is probably the weakest set of chapters in the book but i wasnt as upset about the silly dragonnapping plot as some i do find xaro exceptionally boring so much screen time and yet i cant get invested i really am disliking the harrenhal storyline yes  maise and charles dance have great chemistry but they are really mishandling aryas story the setup of amory lorch as illiterate the stupid chase sequence in the courtyard and the subsequent magic dart was like watching bad fan fiction come to life the idea of arya using her 2nd death wish to eliminate and immediate threat is an interesting one but this is what they come up with uggh and i cannot stand aiden gillen watching littlefinger in action is like watching paint dry and while i like the near rape sequence of sansa  the execution of the opening of the riot and subsequent sandor clegane sequence was poorly put together this could be executed incredibly on screen the tension slowly building and builidng and then the explosion of violence instead we have starving peasants terroring limbs by hand i know its referenced from the book but it looked silly onscreen more moustache twirling joffrey who actually attempts at one point in the book to pacify the crowd by tossing some coins and the sandor clegance 8000 dispatching small folks without a thought just like vanessas first script again this felt a first draft some good scenes muddled together with some nonsense benifoff and weise really need some more experienced screen writers in the room edited by pleonasm 07 may 2012  0215 pm"

"Leuf",2012-05-07,"as far as the letter arya takes this is what ive been able to make out from itmarching ten thousand west to lannisport the tooth estimate to reach you by weeks end scorobb stark moving troops south by coast   will turn east at silverhillnow i cant see this as being from either talisa or roose because why would they mention robb in the middle of the letter the whole letter would be about what robb is doing if it were either of them i think it has to be from some other lannister force the remnants of staffords host i suppose who are talking about what they are doing and then what their scouts report robb is doing but were surely supposed to be suspecting talisai think arya takes it because she thinks she can use the info to find her way to robb not to try to hide it from tywinirri sadpng classbbcemoticon alt  i really liked what they did with qarth last episode especially the whole interaction between dany irri and doreah so im pissed about irri being killed ill be even more mad if doreah was part of it and she dies too im okay with the dragons being taken though i thought the kl riot scene was well done except the arm being ripped off which was just silly surprised they showed sansas almost rapeim not on board with the changes to jons story but have to admit that ygrittes wiggling made up for it"
"WeirwoodTreeHugger",2012-05-07,"according to ancient astronaut theorists littlefinger must be an extraterrestrial who can make einsteinrosen bridges to travel westeros at least if lf is travelling we dont have to see him in the brothel i think they are softening tywin to set up the rw if non book reading audiences start to think hes not so bad it will be very shocking that he orchestrates a cold blooded murder perhaps talisajeyne is being forced to participate in this scam like roslin frey if she doesnt know about the assasination plot she can admit shes a spy profess her love etc robb could marry her to keep her safe so she can run away from home this way she can be a spy and still fall in love with him that would be ok with me but they need some better dialogue you can get cheesy romance anywhere as to the jonygritte chase scene sure it was pointless but it took up one minute and doesnt change the story arc is it worth all this upset why does roose saying ramsay is at the dreadfort mean he cant be dagmer roose has to tell the truth all of a sudden roose could have sent a raven to ramsay as soon as theon departs for the iron islands and ramsay could have hurried over there it requires a bit of a plot stretch to imagine that none of the ironborn noticed he was a stranger but oh well"
"Morrigan",2012-05-07,"hats off to whoever came up with dagmerramsaythats brilliant it makes perfect sense dagmer already seems to take over reeks function at theons side and it would explain why they didnt cast ramsay they actually did right under our noses sneaky bastardsno its not brilliant and it makes zero sense what would ramsay be doing in the iron islands also why would the other ironborn accept him as their own as if theyd known him for a long while do you people actually think these things through or ooshe needed to be free that way she wasnt locked up under guardso why not do it like in the book where she says give me a spear and kicks a guy in the bollocks and theon is impressed at her fierceness oh thats right no boobies that wayalmost every change that has been made is an improvement on the source material and makes for a tighter more interesting showwhat i just ah i just cant believe there are people like that wow inconsistent characters plot holes gratuitous sex and lazy writing  asoiaf okayand jon chased ygritte for any of many reasons not the least of which is to prevent her from warning the free folk and because he was supposed to have killed herand how is he going to prevent her from doing that without yknow killing herrockroi is completely correct the scene made no sense and was badly written it was also very cheesy i think its by far the worst part of the episodei had to post this on its own why do half of you people even watch the damn show so you can comlain about every episode get over it its just a tv show would you rather know everything thats going to happen scene by scene like previously said get over it or get a girlfriendwhy do you post here so you can complain about complaints get over it its just a message board get over it and get a girlfriendi never clocked that until you mentioned it not all of us are so observant and thats the thing these issues are nitpicks not grand problems as you make them out to be i personally loved this episode and only started noticing a lot of the continuitysilly stuff when i came on here come on guys lets calm downerm what you didnt notice the zombie mob the arm flying off and the guts spilling out i didnt notice it on a rewatch or anything i only saw the episode once and im not the most acutely observant of watchers it was right therethis just looks like needless cynicism i dont really got what your problem is on this one its just a rant about what i found the scene quite sweet the lines showed jons vulnerability and selfdoubt and their chemistry worked well i can see their scenes later being really good and i didnt have a problem with the fact that there was an element of comedy it doesnt have to be 100 serious all of the timerockroi already explained why the scene was stupid basically if jon meant to spare her and we know he did he didnt miss that sword swing why was he chasing her he wasnt going to kill her he wasnt going to follow her all the way to the wildling camp he wasnt going to take her back as prisoner to qhorin since qhorin would have killed her even if you want to make jon an indecisive moron which is a crappy thing to do to the character the scene still doesnt make sensenow youre just being pessimistic theres nout wrong with the scenes theyve put in either why not trust the writers and see where it goeswhy would i trust them when ive found their writing to be lamentable as far as these things are concerned im only pessimistic because they keep making stupid decisionsdont mean to be a twat and just nitpick all your nitpicks but seriously dare i say purist sure im a purist i want to watch an adaptation of the novels i loved not a bastardized badly written fanfiction i dont hate every single change just the ones they do poorly it just happens that this episode had a fuckton of those edited by morrigan 07 may 2012  0813 pm"

"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2012-05-07,"i think its because they changed the purpose of jonqhorins mission in the book they were just scouting so letting her go wasnt a big deal now they are going for a sneak assassination so they cant afford to have anyone give warning and have mance be ready for them when they show up at his camp"
"Leuf",2012-05-07,"no its not brilliant and it makes zero sense what would ramsay be doing in the iron islands also why would the other ironborn accept him as their own as if theyd known him for a long while do you people actually think these things through or oothe theory was based on the fact that dagmer comes up to theon after the rest of the crew leaves him for the boat and only then introduces himself as first mate then proceeds to manipulate theon into completely changing his plans if theon calls him first mate when they get on the boat the rest of the crew has no reason to argue the pointits far fetched but less crackpot than many theories far more likely dagmer is just filling the role of reek"

"Planetary",2012-05-07,"great episode for those of us who have read the books keep in mind that we have absolutely no reference point for people who know the story only from the tv show its very easy to forget how lost or overwhelmed people can get with a cast this big a story that hops around so much and all the things that are left unsaid in dialogue but are present only in the little details the hbo folks get those little details right the vast majority of the time and when they change something its almost always for the sake of leaner more efficient storytelling thats the reality of a 10episode season regarding the raging over roose and ramsay the changes are necessary the audience has to see that roose bolton is robbs bannerman and supporter otherwise no one will care that some random dude theyve never seen before goes and betrays robb the writers have managed to kill two birds with one stone â<U+0080><U+0094> bolton is established as robbs bannerman hes seen with robb in several scenes and in the meantime the audience gets to see much much more of charles dance as tywin lannister my only nitpick is where the hell is the greatjon my guess is it wasnt worth it for the actor or the shows budget to have him just hanging out in the background but for the sake of consistency it would have been nice to see him this season among robbs lords finally ygritte wow rose leslie is gorgeous and im happy to see a real redhead not a brunette with a bad dyejob she was fantastic in this episode and i hope we see a lot more of her"
"Planetary",2012-05-07,"i think part of the the abduction by the warlocks is that their magic will age the dragons a bit so they are more impressive for their needed roles in the slave citiesi also though the tower we see at the end is the house of the undying or part of it on tv its a lot easier to get that jarring spatial effect if a character walks into a narrow tower and suddenly the inside is a vast room too big for the exteriorrather than using a low building and putting lots of stairs in it"
"templar7",2012-05-07,"well i was expecting more negative reactions to be honest yes im a bit of a book purist book what book lol but i dont mind changes when they are smart andor wellwritten most of those in this episode really really werent for instance i enjoyed tywin and aryas interactions in the 5th episode i could list examples of other changes i thought made sense andor that i enjoyed but to save time ill just nerdrage about how stupid this episode was overall i want an adaptation of the novels i loved not a goddamn fanfiction facepalmyeah but i always assumed he was just trampled to death or beaten up by a lynch mob that whole zombielike ripping scene was beyond cheesy and retarded a human arm just doesnt get torn off like that for crying out loud when the mob started snarling like zombies i snorted in derision and thought whats this a romero movie when the arm came off i just had to laugh idioticspeaking of cheesy gore while i enjoyed sandor trouncing those wouldbe rapists i mean its hard to not enjoy the hound kicking ass the guts spilling out was just stupid gore like that belongs in a zombie flick not game of thrones it looked goofy and cartoonishretarded indeed i feel for that actress there was no need to cut her especially considering there was a dead handmaiden in the series and her name was doreah instead they kill off the brown girl in a completely retarded scene to boot and keep doreah alive because because fuck you is why yes thats what were claiming really oh wait no bugger offagreed thank you and thank you for pointing out the sheer idiocy of the jonygritte scene oh my fucking god that was retarded and pointless and nerdrage inducing you know i get that the show needs to cut to adapt blah blah blah budget constraint tv format etc but nothing nothing whatsoever justified this change it was not only longer than it needed to be it made no sense the only reason i can think of is to make jon look like a complete fucktard ughanother needless addon osha sleeping with theon just more gratuitous nudity again it wasnt necessary to her plot to spirit the boys out of winterfell she could just have waited for theon to be asleep normally and do all the rest but that way there would be no bewbies derpand then there was danys dragons being stolen what i mean seriously what why why why perfect example of change for the sake of change and dont tell me its to give dany something to do dany already had plenty of reasons to visit the house of the undying this was just supremely lazy writing to artificially add tension and a cliffhanger to the episode and so badly done too they come back to the mansion and all those dothraki warriors are dead and yet there isnt a single slain foe in sight derp and wheres doreah oh probably getting naked somewhere duhalso the whole dany needs something to do notion needs to die dany has 5 chapters in acok so what we hardly see jaime either or barristan we dont see lysa at all til the end of asos theon is not at all in a storm of swords they already gutted brans storyline why would they need to add to danys it will be inevitable that some actorscharacters have fewer appearances or screen time for prolonged periods of time due to how the story is written or are you people gonna encourage them to invent arbitrary storylines for theon in season 3 when we all know that he does nothing except being tortured and broken by ramsayand i dread to see what will happen with robb there was nothing wrong with him taking an arrow wound getting feverish and being nursed to health by jeyne it made sense and also catelyn wasnt around to remind him of his duty they made that storyline just far less believable alreadyi was really looking forward to the house of the undying because i figured it was their opportunity to show flashbacks and visions but now im dreading the whole thing i have no reason to trust in the writers and i am expecting the whole thing to suck hey that way i wont be disappointed and if im wrong ill be pleasantly surprisedimo it was the weakest of the entire series so far by farerr no facepalm he was checking her out because she obviously looked familiar to him and he was probably wondering where he saw her before geez the real problem with this scene actually is twofold one littlefinger can apparently teleport seriously hes everyfuckingwhere hes obviously dds favourite character because his screen time is ludicrously high and hes inserted into a bunch of random scenes and places where he never appeared in the books just because enough already and second while i enjoy charles dance and the tywinarya interactions were entertaining they were completely out of character tywin confiding in his cupbearer is just absurd and while arya screaming now at jaqen and jaqens raised eyebrows made for decent humour the way ser amory died was just ridiculous and farfetched i wonder if therell be any followup to that i mean an important bannerman of tywin was murdered just like that i hope there will be consequences at least but now im no longer holding my breath for any weasel soupagreed with the last sentence at least but i wish people wouldnt call it the sack of winterfell it wasnt a sack it was a capture the sackingburning comes later at ramsays hand also i thought winterfells capture and the riot were by far the least offensive parts of the episodewow what a great jab you sure showed him rolleyesgif classbbcemoticon altrolleyes one question to all the comlainers who bitch about every evasion form the novels why watch im relieved that i dont know whats going to happen next and most of the changes they have made still fit and keep it moving in most cases i think they are imrovements its an adaptation not a copy i love the books too dont get me wrong but the sooner i accepted this as a new telling i started liking it more and more the best thing about the books is their unpredictability and the show has it too"
"Snow's Spearwife",2012-05-07,"just watching this again and thought to myself  how could dagmar end up being the bastard what if roose sent him to pyke when robb sent theon back to pyke mayhap roose has been in tywins pocket this whole time and this was one of the schemes to help robb fail since they cant defeat him in battle just a thought"
"Lord Kyle",2012-05-07,"i thought the episode was a masterpiece compared to some of the other episodes but i am too much a purist to say that i loved it enjoyed the siege of winterfell really enjoyed the riot in kings landing hated the robb and talisa scene was able to stomach the first scene with tywin and arya hated the scene with the two of them and littlefinger was amused with jaqen and lorch indifferent to jon and qhorin liked john qhorin and ygritte until john decided to not let her go but not kill her qarth sucks loved roose robb and catlyn simply for confirming ramsay wasnt cut from the show biggest disapointments no ramsay    yet with rodrik dead whos arm will ramsay cut off disapointed with the way lorch was put down this guy pulled a crying child out from under her bed and stabbed her to death along with other atrocities and instead of being stripped naked and thrown into a pit to be killed by a bear he simply gets a poison dart to the neck i guess its because its asoiaf and extremely long intricate complicated and detailed story that i get so upset when changes are made to it in the adaptation when a 334 page book is made into a 2 12 hour long movie with only some noticeable changes its not so bad yeah most of the time the book is probably better but you still get a really good movie out of it silence of the lambs the road but game of thrones leaves me with the same feeling that jurassic park and the lovely bones movies did when compared to the phenomal books that theyre based on"
"The Knight of Flours",2012-05-07,"i really think they will simplify the reekramsay storyline probably just have bolton sneakily take winterfell and then do nasty things to theon and turn him into reek without there having been an original reek or a reekramsay edited by the knight of flours 07 may 2012  1049 pm"
"templar7",2012-05-07,"the show makes it clear just ten seconds earlier that not even many highborn men  and and highranking army commanders know how to read well how likely is that a peasant can much less a girl childi did not like this episode at all there were more plotholes than ploti did not like ygritteâs escape so pontless and ridiculous same as danyâs speech to the spice king she came across like she was about ready to be signed into a mental institution so hysterical and over the topsorry still dont buy it tywin is not a genius hes just rich he leaves a tral of oversights in his wake throughout the books well argued though and i do agree with you on danys speech"
"Robin Of House Hill",2012-05-07,"one issue i have is that the writers are using modern phrases too often when someone says he disrespected me or tywin says give us the room it jars me out of the story"

"Rockroi",2012-05-07,"since morrigan clearly has my back in this fight i gotta return the favor to my hommieone question to all the comlainers sic who bitch about every evasion form the novels why watch im relieved that i dont know whats going to happen next and most of the changes they have made still fit and keep it moving in most cases i think they are imrovements sic its an adaptation not a copy i love the books too dont get me wrong but the sooner i accepted this as a new telling i started liking it more and more the best thing about the books is their unpredictability and the show has it too1 we do not bitch about every deviation from the books i personally loved the scenes that add depth and substance to the characters most notably in season 1 the scene between robert and cersei i loved the circumvention of the reeds not as critical as people think and i have stated really until i am blue in the face just how amazing the tywinarya scenes are i am amazed at how incredible maergery has become even the additions with lf are fine by me anything that adds to the universe i enjoy also some changing of the original was done to conserve time the conflation of the shadow babystannis shadowbut it comes with a price a season of ten hours no more for everything that is added something must be taken away and i insist that the people who make those choices chose wisely and do not mistake me the vast majority of changes have been for the positive but that does not excuse the few that have been cringeworthy most notably the lifeless parlay between stannis and renly 2i watch because its a great show about a great series i enjoy a great deal i honestly thought my 6k posts on this message board would have tipped you off to that 3 when i watch the show i enjoy it as a alternate universe of westeroes game of thrones and as an alternate some changes must be made most changes do fit the overall mold of the show most changes to not dramatically alter the landscape of the overall story but you must concede that some changes can still be bad changes  if a change is poorly done or is misguided or slows down the pace of the story or makes me question what the show is doing etc i have every right to criticize take the jon snow scene where he spares ygritte then chases her because he  is going to free her later maybe but may want to bring her back to halfhand but halfhand said he wanted her dead anyway if that scene happened in the books i would have thought it bizarre and poorly done but because martin is a proven writer with a dramatic track record that rarely happens in other words the fact that its a change is not reason enough to dislike something however if its a bad change then pipping that changes can be good cannot justify it either a good change would be a good a bad one bad and if i take each change and judge each one on its merits which i believe i do then i cannot be fairly accused of being a purist or a nitpicker if a scene is a bad scene it matters not at all if its straight from the books or if its newly imagined its still bad thats why i criticized the jonygritte retelling and because its a waste of limited time its why i love other scenes not every complaint about a change is nitpicking not every defense of a change is somehow openmindedness each one must be evaluated on its own merits and nobody should b complaining about that"

"redriver",2012-05-08,"since morrigan clearly has my back in this fight i gotta return the favor to my hommie1 we do not bitch about every deviation from the books i personally loved the scenes that add depth and substance to the characters most notably in season 1 the scene between robert and cersei i loved the circumvention of the reeds not as critical as people think and i have stated really until i am blue in the face just how amazing the tywinarya scenes are i am amazed at how incredible maergery has become even the additions with lf are fine by me anything that adds to the universe i enjoy also some changing of the original was done to conserve time the conflation of the shadow babystannis shadowbut it comes with a price a season of ten hours no more for everything that is added something must be taken away and i insist that the people who make those choices chose wisely and do not mistake me the vast majority of changes have been for the positive but that does not excuse the few that have been cringeworthy most notably the lifeless parlay between stannis and renly2i watch because its a great show about a great series i enjoy a great deal i honestly thought my 6k posts on this message board would have tipped you off to that3 when i watch the show i enjoy it as a alternate universe of westeroes game of thrones and as an alternate some changes must be made most changes do fit the overall mold of the show most changes to not dramatically alter the landscape of the overall story but you must concede that some changes can still be bad changes  if a change is poorly done or is misguided or slows down the pace of the story or makes me question what the show is doing etc i have every right to criticize take the jon snow scene where he spares ygritte then chases her because he  is going to free her later maybe but may want to bring her back to halfhand but halfhand said he wanted her dead anyway if that scene happened in the books i would have thought it bizarre and poorly done but because martin is a proven writer with a dramatic track record that rarely happens in other words the fact that its a change is not reason enough to dislike something however if its a bad change then pipping that changes can be good cannot justify it either a good change would be a good a bad one bad and if i take each change and judge each one on its merits which i believe i do then i cannot be fairly accused of being a purist or a nitpicker if a scene is a bad scene it matters not at all if its straight from the books or if its newly imagined its still badthats why i criticized the jonygritte retelling and because its a waste of limited time its why i love other scenes not every complaint about a change is nitpicking not every defense of a change is somehow openmindedness each one must be evaluated on its own merits and nobody should b complaining about thatvalid pointsbut i think the time to judge tv deviations from the books is at the end of the serieswe have to give them time to play outfor examplethe dragon theft has raised a few eyebrows round herebut im thinking it adds drama to a drama free passage in danys arcapart from the hotu chapter itselfdo you think the episodes improve on reviewing"
"TheRiderThatMounts",2012-05-08,"how do you know we never witnessed his war councils in acok we never read about him continuously receiving humiliating news from the war we dont know how he reacted to thathe already had the friggin mountain out there terrorizing the small folk setting the riverlands on fire from the gods eye to the red forkwhat more could he have done burning harrenhal down what for no one cares about that pile of rocks least of all the people living therelord tywin is described by others jamie says his father always lets his men talk first he listens and afterwards he gives commandsi doubt lord tywin would ever surround himself with people he cant rely onhis reaction towards amory lorch  i have a really hard time believing it since lorch is one of his birds of prey and dont forget in the books when he leaves harrenhall lorch is left in chargethe fact is they ruined the character of tywin lannisterthey are trying to turn him into a villaini did not see him like this in the books i just saw him as a lord doing what came natural to those like himhe sent the mountain to burn the land because he wanted the river lords to try and defend each village and castle instead of combining their forces and adding them to robbs northernersand he does care about harrenhall remember his reaction when he finds out cersei made janos slynt lord of harrenhall"

"Thunderfist",2012-05-08,"this episode was so bad it was almost painful to watch david and dan claim to be huge fans of the series then why do they want to fck it up so bad so many issues that i hardly know where to begin the winterfell scene while very different from the books worked for me it got the job done even if it might have implications for theon in the future we have the scene with the riot in kings landing which was decent all in all but still had some bad stuff in it why was myrcella crying when the books make a point about her not doing it itâs a minor change but why change it at all and when the crowd ripped the arm of the high septon what the hell was that all about i kept waiting for them to start shouting braaaaaiiins and begin eating people and as much as i love the hound and the fact that he came to rescue sansa the added gore just makes the show feel like a really cheap horror movie the scenes from harrenhall were really really bad this week first we have the stupid stuff about the secret message that got sent to the madeup house although it goes against the laws of geography and ravenry then we have friendly uncle tywin who is pretty much father of the year in westeros i get that they need to give us a reason why arya doesnât have jaqen off tywin but to make him this soft and incompetent goes against everything the book made him out to be then we have littlefinger who teleports around westeros showing up in places he never visited i wouldnât be surprised if we find him in mance rayders tent or at a meeting with dany the next season in the books lf is probably one of the most competent players in the game in the show heâs stupid with no style or discretion and the scene where arya got chased was just breathtakingly bad i was waiting for a shot of a corridor full of doors where they would run in and out of those doors and weâd hear some silly music in the background like something out of a scooby doo episode the scenes with jon snow were full of stupidity as well i agree with rockroi about how strange it is that he chases after ygritte whatâs also strange is that jon runs what 150200 meters to catch ygritte and all of a sudden heâs completely lost in the wilderness and qhorin mothereffing halfhand super ranger master tracker and expert survivalist canât find him when you run in snow you make tracks hell anyone could track jon snow and find him and the whole ygrittegrinding what was that all about they are wearing 20 layers of clothing heâs not gonna feel shit my bet is that the producers really wanted another stupid tascene but they figured that it would be too unrealistic if ygritte stripped in 50 c however once they get into a cave or near a fire you can bet that those furs are gonna come off from one stupid scene to the next as we join up with the cast of dawsons creek err i mean robb stark lord of winterfell and king in the north robbs scenes with this talisa person the looks the dialogue makes my stomach turn then all of a sudden catelyn teleports back in maybe she borrowed lfâs teleporter and robb simply goes hay mum look at this hawt chick iâm drooling over instead of perhaps saying so i heard that renly baratheon got killed by a woman while you were in his tent and who might this enourmous woman in armor be and catelyn is really weak and stupid and simply goes there there robby remember that you gotta marry old walders ugly granddaughter back at the twins instead of doing what any sane person would and think damn look at my boy eyehumping this hot chick i better make sure to get this girl the fck out of here or all kinds of shit is gonna hit the fan dany damn i didnât think it was possible for her character to annoy me more than it does in the books but emilia clarke is doing her best to prove me wrong the girl has got what 35 fighting men and 3 hamstersized dragons and sheâs still going all fire and blood take back what was mine gawds go nibble some olives and chill the fck down then to screw things up a bit more the showmakers conjure up a dragonstealingscene that destroys everything the books tells us about qarth and itâs people well done but the episode wouldnât be complete without some ta so the showrunners picked up the big hat and pulled a name from it whoâs gonna do some nudity this week  oh look itâs osha what is the point of this scene to get more boobs on the show to prove that all men will become utter and complete idiots as soon as there is a woman within 10 meters and to all you people who seem to get really excited whenever there is a boob on the show havenât you ever seen any before try a simple google search for boob breast or tits and iâm sure that youâll find more boobs than you could ever imagine and maybe if the showrunners did the same they wouldnât need to throw more of them into the show iâm gonna give this show until the end of this season if shit doesnât improve and if they keep fcking everything up then i am done my expectations are so low right now that nothing would surprise me iâm thankful that jaime has been invisible this entire season because it would have been painful to watch them screw my favourite character up although i have full confidence that they will have time for some briennejaime sex just for the sake of it"
"HouseLark",2012-05-08,"agreed like i said before lord tywin does not surround himself with idiotsyou cant blame that one on dd martin made amory lorch an idiot i also dont think that lorch is entirely illiterate as many have been saying hes simply a poor reader or maybe even just lazy tywin will always have a place for useful idiots like lorch who are willing to do unspeakable things even robb has a place in his retinue for a man that he knows would flay people alive given half a chance"
"Raksha the Demon",2012-05-08,"big yes to the taking of winterfell theons falling further from grace as he messily slaughters poor ser rodrik yes to parts of the riot joffreys being his usual vicious killkillkill self he looked so tiny and helpless in the hounds grip as the big guy pulled him back to safety it was cute especially sandors looking like he wanted to just leave his charge to the mercies of the crowd the violence to sansa was scary but realistic and hooray for the hounds saving her the crowds should have been larger though and it felt like the riot took place a hundred ft away from the doors of the red keep so they could get the royals and servants back to safety quite quickly another joffreyslap yes made my day odd conversation between sansa and shae  at least the writers managed to convey sansas not hating the crowd wanting to give them bread if she could perhaps she and shae will end up bffs after all and go picnicking with margaery eventually cool4gif classbbcemoticon altcool4  i love tywin and arya together but why would lord tywin lannister unburden himself about his sons childhood dyslexia to a serving girl even a clever serving girl hes not just a distracted politician hes tywin who is not egalitarian or at all interested in what servants think of him except their knowing to obey himtalisarobb conversation  ugh hollywood banter and very awkward banter too personally i think she was writing a letter about the young wolfs whereabouts to lord tywin robb should listen to his mother and the way catelyns momradar went off and expressed itself was much better done than the silly young love between battles thing the only good or at least atmospheric thing about talisa is that she hasnt taken her clothes off yet to fulfill the hbo nudity requirement in a canoncompliant way speaking of hbo nudity requirements i was thrilled to see yet another rozfree episode ygritte is gutsy pretty and more fun to watch than talisa maegi of volantis or wherever  probably because grrm wrote her an advantage over talisa who grrm did not write and she hasnt yet started telling jon he knows nothingand osha snuck the stark boys and hodor out of winterfell you go girl"
"TheRiderThatMounts",2012-05-08,"lorch is a monster not an idiot he may very well be illiterate but if so lord tywin would never give him the task of sending messages come on now we are talking about tywin lannister a man so diabolical and smart that he manages to take advantage of every little mistake his enemyes make i mean the man even contacted and bought robbs motherinlaw okay so maybe he didnt have to try very hard to persuade her to betray robb since she was his motherinlaw biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd  but still smart move with one message he eliminated robbs children with another he eliminated robb and then he sent another message to the leech lord and won the north to me lord tywins looks like a man who thinks everything through and whose plans are perfectly done i dont see him making mistakes taking a northern girl as a cupbearer is something he would have never done were talking about the guy who inspired the rains of castamere"
"HouseLark",2012-05-08,"the best episode of the series so far i have no real problem with any of the booktoscreen changes the only disappointment is the kings landing riot which seemed small scale because of the nowfamiliar budgetary constraints the ygrittejon scenes were fine and theres still space for jon to release her in the next episode  i fully expect this to happen i didnt even mind the grinding it wasnt sexual in any way ygritte had just found a way to make jon very uncomfortable and he didnt know how to deal with it whereas if she had done anything else to try and get to him spit at him maybe he would probably have been able to deal with it the winterfell scenes were fantastic very well done i loved that theon could not carry out a clean execution it marked him out as something other than a stark executions are a big part of the books and theons inability to perform a clean execution will find a counterpoint in future series when a real stark jon takes janos slynts head rodrik and bran were great in those scenes devastating i have less of a problem with lord tywin having a softer side than most people i thought tywin was onedimensional in the books and in truth this different side to tywin i isnt really that soft and ii is perfectly inkeeping with his character since it is all related to his family hes proud of helping jaime to learn to read but it quickly becomes apparent that he did so to ensure that jaime was not in any way weak like tywins father the two stories of tywin helping jaime learn to read and his description of his fathers weakness were very much related ill forgive the aryaamory lorch chase as a moment of action my only hope for that storyline is that we start to hear more about the ghost of harrenhal the small folk would be superstitious and two unexplained deaths would have them whispering there is a bit of a problem with the poison dart though  tywin will now know that theres an assassin in the castle i dont have much to say on danys story other than that i think it should have been cut it seems largely irrelevant and i wonder if it has been stretched because emilia clarke will be one of the few actors that have been contracted for 46 years so they need to have her do something a couple of stray points 1 do we have an idea about the passage of time between episodes its hard to get around the littlefinger teleportation issue without that maybe weeks passed if so then i suppose it makes sense but then so little time appears to have passed in qarth and beyond the wall between e05 and e06 2 im starting o think stannis is a problem this episode really benefited from not having the stannis storyline inserted anywhere his arc is feeling pretty weak right now and i think that part of the problem is the lack of any real foreshadowing in series one in hindsight i wonder if they regret not at least having stannis talked of a lot more last series"

"Zod",2012-05-08,"so the letter talisa was writing was she actually sarcastic when she said she was a spy she may have told the truth jokingly so that no one would be suspicious of her the young wolf is on the move was that what she really wrote"
"Zod",2012-05-08,"one issue i have is that the writers are using modern phrases too often when someone says he disrespected me or tywin says give us the room it jars me out of the storyby the way is the word grammar a relatively modern worddaenerys said that word when she was correctedi have no problem with the stolen eggs im just bitching about irri dyingyou mean the dragonsby the way what was on that sheet of paper arya took from tywins tablewas it a letter directed from littlefinger to arya or something i mean arya was pretty determined to take it edited by zod 08 may 2012  0430 am"

"Targaryen Kaiser",2012-05-08,"this episode was good definitely not as bad as some people think it isharrenhal i dont get the whole ruckus with a peasant being able to read it isnt that unbeliavable im pretty sure that in medieval ages many servants learn reading which is easier to learn than writing from their lords merchant bosses etc how would tywin suddenly realise the girl is a highborn and actually arya she is supposed to be vip prisoner heavily guarded at kings landing her escape would have been a major incident one that he would have been informed for cercei is the reason tywin does not realize the girl is arya not ddkings landing loved the whole riot scene peter drinklage nailed it again but no one mentioned how great jack gleeson portrayed a mad joffreys emotion full of rage and humiliation with that psychotic face the hound rulesbeyond the wall i really liked ygritte she is even better than how i have pictured her on my mind when i was still reading acok the hunt scene where jon catches her and they have to spend a night together foreshadows the bond they are going to have later in a very good manner in the next episode i assume that jon will see qhuorin closing by and he will let her leave finally jons story is getting interestingwinterfell i dont know if the directors wanted to surprise the viewers but i think that the whole capture of the castle was a bit sudden i liked alfis acting he portrayed theon perfectly especially in sir rodrics execution good to see summer and shaggy dog and asha is hot as hell tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp rest capturing the dragons save the producers from having drogon in danys side while she is walking inside thotu yeah im on the optimistic side and i still believe we will see her having the visions in there finally i hope that jeynes name is indeed jayne and not talissaone issue i have is that the writers are using modern phrases too often when someone says he disrespected me or tywin says give us the room it jars me out of the storyand there are dragons too there werent dragons in the medieval age tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp "

"sharksbreath",2012-05-08,"overall i thought it was a pretty good episode it seems a lot of people are complaining that danys khalasar is being killed off but the victims looked like daxos servants to me other than irri i also wonder if drogon may have escaped the dragonappers since they only showed two tails i do think theyre portraying dany as too much of a petulant entitled brat but i guess she doesnt really start to show here true leadership capabilities and heart until asos edited by sharksbreath 08 may 2012  1257 pm"

"insertname",2012-05-08,"while this episode had a rather big bunch of inconsistencies some of the complaints are rather farfetched and at times illogical themselves if youre already in a bad mood because of errors it can easily happen that you begin counting them and include more stuff than actually is supposed to be in there a thing i wanted to mention about the teleportation with so many different characters its really impossible to tell the story in any way with the time passed being synchronised or even completely chronological martin has been pretty extreme here too littlefinger changing location every episode seems extreme but you cant really tell how much time has passed about who stole the dragons i might have to watch it again but when first viewing it it was obvious to me that this was pyatt pree because the guy carrying it looked like him dom the amount of discussion about this i might have been too quick to judge butedit watched it again and yeah its unclear though i still believe its pyatt pree you get a quick glimpse of the foot which looks wrinkled and the arms also look a bit thin about tywin talking to a cupbearer he doesnt talk with arya he talks to her big difference he doesnt care about her as a person it seemed more like he was just reminiscing about the past by talking out loud im also disappointed about sansa especially her line to shae but i can trust you made me both cringe and facepalm cringe because sansa had already been established about being a bit more clever than thatand facepalm for sansa because honestly yeah you can totally trust the handmaiden that someone you dont know sent to you replacing the old handmaiden right  edited by insertname 08 may 2012  0316 pm"

"mafalda",2012-05-08,"okay so like anyone watching a show i have my likes and dislikes the scene at winterfell was great sure there are only like eight people living in winterfell but they did the best with what they had i like the change of having theon behead rodrik i do wish that ramsey and reek were introduced earlier but the mere mention of roose mentioning his bastard was enough for me naked nymphadora oops tonks sure tywins being a little too chatty with arya but theyre still some seriously amazing award nominating performances i really like jaqen im gonna miss him while i dont like the ticklers death because i was so looking forward to seeing that in sos i like the killing of amory lorch instead of the useless deaths arya originally chose i did want the way jaqen killed amory to be a little more creative isntead of a dart i like tv ygritte soo much better than book ygritte i was cringing waiting for her to say you know nothing jon snow so that i could put my foot through my tv  on a side note it was kind of silly for jon to not kill her assuming hes gonna let her go right only to chase her down when she leaves huh i hope he ends up killing qhorin though the kings landing riot was as best as they could make it and i enjoyed it i mean not only were the horses probably too expensive to get but that would have been very dangerous for everyone involved to include the horses sansan was awesome i somehow thought this would be the only sansan interaction in the book i wish he didnt carry her like a sack of flour though he should have carried her like the repenting nonknight he is i guess we wont see any more ser dontos this season its cool we get to see robb since we dont see much of him in cok i just wish catelyn wasnt there to remind him of his duties because now hes gonna look even more like a moron when he marries her and i dont understand the alias when he finds out shes jeyne westerling shouldnt the fact that she lied to him about her identity throw him off from marrying her if not his vow to the freys okay to the last scene i normally dont like new scenes being added to the story i can deal with leaving stuff out because i understand its hard to condense a 1000 page novel into a 50 minute 10 episode season but this one works because dany didnt really have much to do in cok except wander around the red waste and go to the house of the undying and when reading the books i did wonder why no one tried to steal her dragons i dont care that the storyline was made up what i did mind was them killing off the rest of her tiny khalasar and killing off irri i know everyones like shes only a handmaiden she doesnt serve a purpose blah blah but why is doreah still alive dany had three handmaids and the two brown ones who are supposed to be alive irri and jhiqui no one seems to know what happened to jhiqui from season one are dead yet doreah lives when she is the one whos supposed to be dead the hot one whatever dont try to tell me it isnt about this because it totally is okay whatever as long as we get to see danys visions and where were jorah and doreah when this was happening oh and i loved the spice king schooling dany i love dany shes one of my favorite characters and i do hope she will be the one to claim the iron throne one day but tv dany is getting a little obnoxious she will take what is hers with fire and blood she is the mother of dragons she walked into a burning pit shes immune to fire she did the impossible okay we get it shes acting wayyy too entitled and if i hear that line one more time oh and what is everypnes theory about dagmer being ramsay did i miss something i will now end my post with this it is known"
"The Rune Maester",2012-05-08,"i like tv ygritte soo much better than book ygritte i was cringing waiting for her to say you know nothing jon snow so that i could put my foot through my tv  on a side note it was kind of silly for jon to not kill her assuming hes gonna let her go right only to chase her down when she leaves huh i hope he ends up killing qhorin thoughthe kings landing riot was as best as they could make it and i enjoyed it i mean not only were the horses probably too expensive to get but that would have been very dangerous for everyone involved to include the horses sansan was awesome i somehow thought this would be the only sansan interaction in the book i wish he didnt carry her like a sack of flour though he should have carried her like the repenting nonknight he isokay to the last scene i normally dont like new scenes being added to the story i can deal with leaving stuff out because i understand its hard to condense a 1000 page novel into a 50 minute 10 episode season but this one works because dany didnt really have much to do in cok except wander around the red waste and go to the house of the undying and when reading the books i did wonder why no one tried to steal her dragons i dont care that the storyline was made up what i did mind was them killing off the rest of her tiny khalasar and killing off irri i know everyones like shes only a handmaiden she doesnt serve a purpose blah blah but why is doreah still alive dany had three handmaids and the two brown ones who are supposed to be alive irri and jhiqui no one seems to know what happened to jhiqui from season one are dead yet doreah lives when she is the one whos supposed to be dead the hot one whatever dont try to tell me it isnt about this because it totally is okay whatever as long as we get to see danys visionsand where were jorah and doreah when this was happeningoh and i loved the spice king schooling dany i love dany shes one of my favorite characters and i do hope she will be the one to claim the iron throne one day but tv dany is getting a little obnoxious she will take what is hers with fire and blood she is the mother of dragons she walked into a burning pit shes immune to fire she did the impossible okay we get it shes acting wayyy too entitled and if i hear that line one more timeit is knownhehe i dont know about the book ygritte but this one is beautiful by both wildling and common standards and definitely knows how to ahem warm jon up biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd  maybe his dirty subconscious was at work while chasing her an amazing cast choice for ygritte but i completely agree with you on the very last scene  where the hell is doeah and where was jorah i dont mind the dragons being stolen it definitely adds to the dynamic but it seems quite suspicious almost as if an inside person was involved and dany totally got pawned sadpng classbbcemoticon alt "
"Sir Cadogan",2012-05-08,"okay to the last scene i normally dont like new scenes being added to the story i can deal with leaving stuff out because i understand its hard to condense a 1000 page novel into a 50 minute 10 episode season but this one works because dany didnt really have much to do in cok except wander around the red waste and go to the house of the undying and when reading the books i did wonder why no one tried to steal her dragons i dont care that the storyline was made up what i did mind was them killing off the rest of her tiny khalasar and killing off irri i know everyones like shes only a handmaiden she doesnt serve a purpose blah blah but why is doreah still alive dany had three handmaids and the two brown ones who are supposed to be alive irri and jhiqui no one seems to know what happened to jhiqui from season one are dead yet doreah lives when she is the one whos supposed to be dead the hot one whatever dont try to tell me it isnt about this because it totally is okay whatever as long as we get to see danys visionsand where were jorah and doreah when this was happeningim ok with they adding stuff to make it more interesting whats going to be difficult is that the possible dragon theft was something left open in the book it was hardly ever considered specially because it would raise the question and mainly because we always knew how easy it would be until dany got her unsullied it was the magic of it i always thought of it as some strange politeness or culture feature i saw some people saying that maybe its just to bring her to the hotu but then why kill all those guards and irri  i really liked her  it is known 2"
"Lightning Lord",2012-05-08,"i would be very sad if they chose which handmaiden had to die based upon which one was the more attractive actress since i think doreah betrayed them i dont think its unreasonable that irri died in the theft though along with everyone else its not like she was singled out it would be interesting if jorah was the betrayer there wouldnt need to be a huge change for that to be the case at least through adwd"
"LaceyP84",2012-05-08,"and what a butcher how many times did it take theon to behead ser roderickit was three times in the book looked like overkill in the show if u ask me but i think it got the point across that theon is weak and has no business doing what hes doing"

"HouseLark",2012-05-09,"dany announcing what she and her dragons will do in every episode is becoming very much like robbs camp announcing that hes kotn really just comical to meand are we really expected to believe that robb would not question his mother about renlys death or notice the 63 woman shes picked up on her way back shockedgif classbbcemoticon altshocked  really because that just seriously pushes the envelope of credulity in my estimation i dont care how infatuated you are with volantine medicine woman a six foot three woman wearing battle armor following your mother around would still be hard to missor perhaps im just preternaturally perceptive lolha thats exactly what i thought robb welcomes his mother back and doesnt even take a glance at the big sodding giant that shes brought back with her youd think hed at least make some subtle gesture or that catelyn might even make an effort to say yo boy this is my new close protection oh and shes a woman who can remove the head from the shoulders of any man in fact youd also think that half the camp would be stopping to take a glance thats kind of the point of brienne shes something of a curiosity which is partly where her awkwardness comes fromin fact one of the things that ive noticed is that a lot of the subtlety has left this series last series there were little asides hat added to the depth of the characters the nods between robert and ned at winterfell the glance between ned and arya when sansa was talking about joffrey theons reaction to the news that robb would have to marry a frey etc those little touches are being removed or replaced with hityouintheface exposition or wtf moments"

"The Pretty Good John",2012-05-09,"and yes i know he has been given some additional scenes but that only adds to his mystery im wondering if these extra littlefinger scenes with the arya plotline are leading to something specific  that wasnt in the books first we have the gratuitous scene where cersei threatens his life and tells him to have his people find arya at the time no one understood why that scene was added other than to make cersei look like shes losing her composure then we have the gratuitous scene in this episode where arya is of all places in the seven kingdoms attending to tywin and she even spills wine on littlefinger people seem to think that this scene was added just to increase artificial tension but they had enough tension with lorch seeing her with the note and chasing her etci dont know what its building to maybe when tywin shows up in kings landing littlefinger will ask wheres arya stark didnt you bring her she was your cupbearer at harrenhal what do you mean you didnt know how could you not know young educated northern girl on her own about a thousand miles from home same age as the young educated northern girl that your daughter varys and my spies have been searching frantically for not far from here you didnt know when was the last time you saw herin the books littlefinger had no involvement at all in the arya plot i have to believe these two extra scenes that chewed up precious minutes and made no sense at the time will tie in somewhere down the road"

"Drogon's Personal Trainer",2012-05-09,"best episode this season i felt a bit cheated about not seeing the attack on winterfell but i think the first we heard about it in the book was when bran got woke upin the book bran has warged into summer and sees the attack from outside the castle i was hoping they would do it that way in the series but i fully understand it would have taken away the dramatic impact what works on the page  ie the wolf thinking of manrocks and the scents of blood and steel etc wont work the same in the visual medium then yes ser tom boy and wolf separate again and bran wakes up in bed"
"The Rune Maester",2012-05-09,"ha thats exactly what i thought robb welcomes his mother back and doesnt even take a glance at the big sodding giant that shes brought back with her youd think hed at least make some subtle gesture or that catelyn might even make an effort to say yo boy this is my new close protection oh and shes a woman who can remove the head from the shoulders of any man in fact youd also think that half the camp would be stopping to take a glance thats kind of the point of brienne shes something of a curiosity which is partly where her awkwardness comes fromin fact one of the things that ive noticed is that a lot of the subtlety has left this series last series there were little asides hat added to the depth of the characters the nods between robert and ned at winterfell the glance between ned and arya when sansa was talking about joffrey theons reaction to the news that robb would have to marry a frey etc those little touches are being removed or replaced with hityouintheface exposition or wtf momentsthats actually an excellent point i totally forgot about brienne the distraction we get from jeyne and robb but seriously renly died quickly and was quickly forgotten and the huge blonde womanknight is also forgotten ha"
"Ran",2012-05-09,"looking more closely at that letter i no longer think theres any credence to the idea that it is evidence of a spy in robbs camp it seems pretty clear that the bit before the line about robb stark moving south down the coast is scouts probably scouts report it seems natural enough to think that therell be men in the west keeping an eye on robbs movements and reporting them"

"LordofWinter",2012-05-09,"am i the only one thinking the show is damn faithful to the books all the changes there were were merely tiny changes some little stuff modifiedbut the core is still there the main story lines are still there no change has been reallyimportant so far only tiny details were modified but this is still the exact same story as in the booksa friend of mine and myself were talking about this the other dayhe hasnt read the books i was telling him that he was lucky for not having read the books because he benefits from not being upset about the changes and after i ranted on for a half hour about the millions of little i felt unnecessary changes he said that i was overreacting because they all sounded to him like tiny changes that wont really change much in the but that are more importantsymbolic to fans of the books who are bound to find things they dont like about the adaptation plus the generic it cant be exactly like it was in the books line my argument was that i wouldnt mind so much if it wasnt becoming painfully obvious that the writers of the show are making a point of showing that theirs is a different story my best example of this is renlys lack of peach now i know this will sound petty to some people who claim that the peach holds absolutely no importance to the story i agree to a point but the writers proved in the same episode that they knew about the peach focus shot of renly reaching for the apple but chose to leave it out purposefully knowing readers were anticipating seeing it because if you read the book that little insignificant peach was a topic of discussion for at least a few pages stannis dwells on it forever and while i can understand not being able to make time for that not including the peach seems to me to be a deliberate slap in the face most changes have been small just so but they are all over the place taking ideas and decisions away from certain characters and giving them to other ones removing characters and combing those lost stories into the stories of main characters now im rambling but i want to make it clear that i am not actually trashing the show on its own it is great but as a person who was seriously looking forward to seeing a great series of books turned into a tv show i was and am continually disappointed to find out that i am instead watching a cheap version of fanfictionit is essentially somebody elses rewrite even though they have kept the main plot points i get the feeling that theyll continue to skip over some great subplots and furthermore the way certain scenes played out so differently on the show than they did in the books makes me no longer looking forward to certain scenes as much as i am afraid to see what changes theyll make the down and up playing of certain characters will eventually have to effect the end story differently as of right now im doubting if ill look forward to the rw jon joining the free folkkilling qhjamiebrine and vhoatthe purple weddingramsay takes winterfell and so much more i could be wrongi seriously hope i am but i think when those scenes finally happen these boards are going to be filled with angry readers just my opinion on the subject"

"Brynden Bloodraven",2012-05-09,"this was my favorite episode of the season thus far i had been quite distracted by the seemingly pointless changes from the source text just little things irritating me i have no beef when the source text is changed but is also interesting and better for the medium as in my opinion we saw in episode 6 for example i understand killing ser rodrik hes someone thats been endeared to the audience over the course of season 1 so we feel the loss and realize just how low theon has sunkit had to be someone we already met to have this effect my biggest complaint about the season so far is as has been mentioned earlier the lack of subtlety in the writing theres just so much going on that we miss out on little moments that wink to the readers and may pass over the heads of those viewers who havent delved into the books yet i think that moments like that are necessary and very rewarding to those of us who are constantly looking at the series through the lens of the books"
"House Snow",2012-05-09,"i actually think they are handling baelish quite cleverly when you stop to think about it only we the viewers get to see more of him because we see him interract with so many different people and yes i know he has been given some additional scenes but that only adds to his mystery to the various characters in the tv series he only shows the face he wants them to see of him but as viewers see he has many faces depending on who he is with i rather enjoy this aspect because when viewers see him playing up to so many people and helping them plot against each other we start to wonder which is the real baelish if indeed we have yet seen anything of that person what is he up to you certainly cant determine that from the series so far he seems more obvious in the tv series because we are seeing him objectively and not through the eyes of others in their book povsim starting to agree with this viewpoints ive read through a couple of nonreader threads and they basically see baelish the way we see him in the book he seems very popular among the nonbook readers from what i can tell also agree with the point that its much easier for martin to have people comment on how devious littlefinger is through their monologue than to do that on the show plus it would be a little more shockingrealistic if he didnt seem to be the little miss perfect schemer he was in the book"

"Lyana",2012-05-09,"im definitely on the oneofthebestepisodessofar camp the sack of winterfell was really heartbreaking the contrast of brans reactions at the begining when theon enters his room and during the beheading of ser rodrick was a nice touch the kid is doing a fine acting job and theon  there was definitely an anakyn skywalkermoment there the expression on his face after he kicks off the head from the body says clearly there is no turning back ive actually never liked theon but love the drama of his character btw am i the only one who is wondering where summer is when theon comes into brans room they didnt exclusively emphasized in the show that the wolves are held captive in the gods wood did they those wide shots in the second season of the show are really great love the scenes north of the wall love to see ghost again qhorin was not exactly how i imagined him and i have a problem with the fact that jon was the one who wanted to join qhorins group in the show iirc qhorin took the initiative in the books but i could live with that hopefully they will go somewhere with those changes i cant understand all the complaining about the jonygritte  scenes yes there are some changes but i am still positive and prefer to wait and see the purpose of all this i got from the scene that jon was hesitating to kill ygritte as in the books i think it was a lastminute decision to cut the rock instead of ygrittes head when he realized he cannot kill a woman but then he panicked and started chasing her without thinking it was just some rush panickingreaction imo i still wonder about the purpose of this change  perhaps it is a setup for the jonygritte relationship i just hope they wont change jons character in some drastic way im ok with the jonscenes so far the actress playing ygritte is great and the chemistry between them works so far i am still convinced that jon wont go straight to the wildlingscamp without having killed qhorin the aryatywin scenes are superb those two could really have a show on their own and no one would complain abot that i am not a lannister fan except for tyrion and a bit of jaime so even if tywin is represented more humanly in the show i dont like him charles dance is doing a great job though dont mind the dialog between him and arya dont mind even the hiding game with lf my only complaint is that we see too much lf and not enough varys want more varys stealing the letter gave arya a good reason to choose the second death it was more plausible for the nonbook readers that way imo the riot scene in kl was very intense i dont mind the lack of hourses the anger of the crowd the panick of the nobles  i just bought it my only complaint was that joff got slapped only once danys scenes were at least interesting for me as always i enjoyed how condescendig the spice merchant was and the whole i will burn this and that  is really starting to go on my nerves the stealing of the dragons didnt wake any emotions we all know she is going to have her dragons back at the house of undying i still have some hope for the prophesies left robb oh robb you trully are a king i hate that the show made robb such a lovable character i liked him in the books but the second season showed him in a really good light now i like him even more in the show i have no doubts that jane is the beautiful nurse still not sure what the purpose of the whole hiding of her personality is i gues well have to wait and see imho this episode was really dynamic dramatic showed some very important moments and despite all the changes from the series it was really great edited by lyana 09 may 2012  0734 pm"

"Dio Forel",2012-05-09,"this is a tv series that only gets to follow specific povs one of the biggest issues is that the book goes on about 50000 different plot tangents which is why now by book 5 we are basically seeing no progress it is pretty hard to make significant progress with so many plot arcs the whole point of the tv show being different is they are giving more time and more storyline to main arcs because it is blatantly less timematerial to work with people say its 10 different 1 hour episodes but this isnt even true at all the show starts at 9pm they say but the show actually doesnt even begin til like 904 then the opening sequence is a few minutes in itself then the show winds up ending at like 951 each episode is actually more like 50 minutes we want this show to last so it has to appeal to all demographics and have different entertainment values like comedy violence sex appeal and drama to survive the prime time world people condemn the 2nd most wealthy guy in quaith for being so over the top and strange but thats what they were like in similar times think of the guy in gladiator that announced the games for the gladiator arena all fancy in his wig and makeup people condemn robb for how he acted with tylisajeyne saying for him to be a kid since its his first love robb is the king so he acted like a kid trying to be a king flirting with a girl with false arrogance and they did age him up so it isnt like he is the same child in the books as for this season seeming rushed in a lot of ways i agree it is but i blame hbo for not giving the season enough time to handle depicting so many different arcs we dont get 10 hours we get more like 9 when all is said and done with credits stupid show previews and late starts so there is no way for us to get the elaborate show we all want which is why its perfectly fine that apparently littlefinger has access to secret railroads to travel around because if we based his travel on a somewhat realistic timeline itd wind up taking him 7 episodes to go from one place to the next and my one main negative i must say is that some people are so happy they saw the direwolves idk about you but i agree with the few who have mentioned the lack of wolf action this season i feel like the most we have gotten so far is the equivalent of the wolves hopping on screen waving to us then scampering off to who knows where the amount we see them isnt even enough to be considered cameos ghost hasnt looked like the vicious and intuitive wolf i see in the books hes some wandering wolf that pops in to say hi then disappears to have no involvement in the storyline whatsoever if this show had more legitimate time to display the storylines i think it would be phenomenally better to everybody there is no reason to just get 10 short episodes there is way too much story to be told and the lack of time to show it is the sole reason for all of the complaints we see about timewarping littlefinger and all rushed storytelling that and the fact that some people just love nitpicking about something because lets be honest one of the best things about a show is the ability to criticize because a show thrives on positive and negative critique what we should worry about is if nobody says anything love and hate implies the show is on our minds ignorance and silence implies this show is doomed so it is safe to say we are all safe for the next season hopefully hbo decides to start the show on time stop showing so many previews during our dedicated got timeslot and give us some more damn episodes to tell the overwhelmingly elaborate story with some justice and on a side note i did actually laugh when lorch got sniped like that as random as the method was theres nothing wrong with a little laughter people"

"Morrigan",2012-05-10,"it may be that arya uses her 3rd kill to escape rather than killing the guard herselfjesus fucking christ i hope not that would be the single worst change in the entire series so far and it would be so bad that i just might give up on the series if they do that arya needs to kill that guard by herself using her wits dropping the coin and saying valar morghulis since thats the title of the final episode im hoping that this scene will be intact at least"
"Dio Forel",2012-05-10,"no its not brilliant and it makes zero sense what would ramsay be doing in the iron islands also why would the other ironborn accept him as their own as if theyd known him for a long while do you people actually think these things through or ooagreed that is not an arc that needs to have a character like dag replace ramsay or have their roles merged into some synergistic new character plotlinewhat i just ah i just cant believe there are people like that wow inconsistent characters plot holes gratuitous sex and lazy writing  asoiaf okayi disagree that the storyline on the show is surpassing grrms story but this is tv not the books we dont have thousands upon thousands of pages to have a story depict every single facet of asoiaf we have minuteshours to try and show some sort of semblance to the story grrm told inconsistent characters are only because on screen certain things must be changed to carry the story plot holes are inevitable because there is just no realistic way to follow the true story in such a small amount of time gratuitous sex is fine with me lazy writing i disagree with its more just bad writing on some fronts they tried to do something and failedwhy do you post here so you can complain about complaints get over it its just a message board get over it and get a girlfriendtheres a difference between critique in a respectful manner and nitpicking in a disputatious manner compare the difference between tywin diligently explaining his beliefs and dany on her childish targ rant whining and stomping all the way there are ways of getting a point across without being so combative but i dont hate for that fact is that its the love of the story that causes us to be combative sometimes its hard to see that from the outside we are so tied to the story that we just get defensive bottom line is we need the aggressive angry rants as much as the calm  respectful synopsis of each episode i myself channel all that rage towards grrm saying our next book will be at least 23 yrs away wtf manerm what you didnt notice the zombie mob the arm flying off and the guts spilling out i didnt notice it on a rewatch or anything i only saw the episode once and im not the most acutely observant of watchers it was right therethe arm flying was interesting it did seem more like they chewed thru the guy instead of tearing him apart that really didnt bother me it just made it more evident how vicious the murder was but i guess they felt the need to exaggerate the severityrockroi already explained why the scene was stupid basically if jon meant to spare her and we know he did he didnt miss that sword swing why was he chasing her he wasnt going to kill her he wasnt going to follow her all the way to the wildling camp he wasnt going to take her back as prisoner to qhorin since qhorin would have killed her even if you want to make jon an indecisive moron which is a crappy thing to do to the character the scene still doesnt make senseis it really that crappy given his eventual endresult as head of the nw i think it really enhances how controversial his being the head of the nw was he did some stupid ish people didnt exactly consider him the epitome of a leader and he missed her thinking okay heres my moment for a love connection to discuss what to do from here and she split i think the books version of the events worked better personally but for what they chose to do it isnt that surprising he spared her and she ran away so he wanted to chase her so that his act of indiscretion and mercy didnt come back to haunt himwhy would i trust them when ive found their writing to be lamentable as far as these things are concerned im only pessimistic because they keep making stupid decisionsi just think the problem is saying hey take a 100 hour story and tell it in 9 hours things need to be changed to make it work onscreen people always use lotr as a reference to this book and show lotr was ridiculously successful as a movie trilogy and there were so many changes to the story to fit the timeline and carry a certain time progression standard and atmosphere to the depiction if lotr stayed true to the storyline of the books i sincerely doubt the success wouldve been as great the writing isnt lamentable the decisions arent stupid we have unlimited time on here to critique and say how things should be but with a time restraint the writers do not have this luxury while trying to build a world for us to attach ourselves to coming attractions for the wonderful sarcsasm episode of veep that is an hour away take away from much needed time that could be used to tell the story it would be nice as well to have the show start on time those extra minutes would surely benefit the writerssure im a purist i want to watch an adaptation of the novels i loved not a bastardized badly written fanfiction i dont hate every single change just the ones they do poorly it just happens that this episode had a fuckton of thoseironic the mention of bastardizing with reference to jon snow i will have to concede the point that jon snows storyline seems to be taking the biggest hit due to time constraints i wouldnt say this is a degraded version of the books equivalent to a badly written fanfiction though that seems somewhat extreme we are just dealing with a world that is far too vast to be conveyed in any reasonable manner within 10 so not 1 full hour episodes hbo is shooting themselves in their respective feet with this as far as i am concerned this show has the potential to carry the channel and most of television for years to come ive seen so many shows have 20 1 hour episodes in a season that shouldnt have even been able to make more than 5 episodes budgetary concerns need to be addressed and it needs to be that we can have more time to tell this story given the amount of time we are allowed there is no realistic way of telling this story without rushing certain aspects tweaking certain elements to accommodate the limited timeframe blame hbo not the writers try going out to vegas for a weekend for crazy parties and to experience everything you never experienced before then try to tell the 72 hour story fri thru sun in 50 minutes while hitting every key moment of the experience kinda hard to do that isnt it in essence a season is equal to a visual synopsis of each book it hits the key points but unfortunately for the sake of time many aspects go unnoticed or unmentioned edited by dio forel 10 may 2012  1249 am"

"Arawni",2012-05-10,"now im rambling but i want to make it clear that i am not actually trashing the show on its own it is great but as a person who was seriously looking forward to seeing a great series of books turned into a tv show i was and am continually disappointed to find out that i am instead watching a cheap version of fanfictionit is essentially somebody elses rewrite even though they have kept the main plot points i get the feeling that theyll continue to skip over some great subplotsa cheap version of fanfiction you call budget of 5060 millions of dollars cheap if it is a fanfiction its a damn expensive fanfictionand about the second point  that seems to be the problem for many readers of asoiaf seems like they expected to get a filmed version of the books or even felt that produsers are somehow obliged to follow the books exacly because this is what readers wanted but the thing is that hbo is not doing got only for people who have read the whole book series but also to people like me who have not read those books so they make choices that makes it easier for us to follow plot without needing to read those books or go to internet and check who was who ect for example tickler and his death in the last episode people here were right pointing out that nobody of nonreaders would remember him anymore in the next season and so his death would mean nothing to us or at least not so much as it means for readersso maybe it is a fanfiction but its a damn good fanfiction and even though ill probably get stoned for this ill say it anyways id choose got over the books anyday i do understand that people love those books but personally im just happy that series doesnt follow them in everything otherwise one season would last for like 50 episodes instead of 910 who would watch that"

"Kvothe the Arcane",2012-05-10,"im definitely on the oneofthebestepisodessofar campthe sack of winterfell was really heartbreaking the contrast of brans reactions at the begining when theon enters his room and during the beheading of ser rodrick was a nice touch the kid is doing a fine acting job and theon  there was definitely an anakyn skywalkermoment there the expression on his face after he kicks off the head from the body says clearly there is no turning back ive actually never liked theon but love the drama of his characterbtw am i the only one who is wondering where summer is when theon comes into brans room they didnt exclusively emphasized in the show that the wolves are held captive in the gods wood did theythose wide shots in the second season of the show are really great love the scenes north of the wall love to see ghost again qhorin was not exactly how i imagined him and i have a problem with the fact that jon was the one who wanted to join qhorins group in the show iirc qhorin took the initiative in the books but i could live with that hopefully they will go somewhere with those changes i cant understand all the complaining about the jonygritte  scenes yes there are some changes but i am still positive and prefer to wait and see the purpose of all this i got from the scene that jon was hesitating to kill ygritte as in the books i think it was a lastminute decision to cut the rock instead of ygrittes head when he realized he cannot kill a woman but then he panicked and started chasing her without thinking it was just some rush panickingreaction imo i still wonder about the purpose of this change  perhaps it is a setup for the jonygritte relationship i just hope they wont change jons character in some drastic way im ok with the jonscenes so far the actress playing ygritte is great and the chemistry between them works so far i am still convinced that jon wont go straight to the wildlingscamp without having killed qhorinthe aryatywin scenes are superb those two could really have a show on their own and no one would complain abot that i am not a lannister fan except for tyrion and a bit of jaime so even if tywin is represented more humanly in the show i dont like him charles dance is doing a great job though dont mind the dialog between him and arya dont mind even the hiding game with lf my only complaint is that we see too much lf and not enough varys want more varys stealing the letter gave arya a good reason to choose the second death it was more plausible for the nonbook readers that way imothe riot scene in kl was very intense i dont mind the lack of hourses the anger of the crowd the panick of the nobles  i just bought it my only complaint was that joff got slapped only oncedanys scenes were at least interesting for me as always i enjoyed how condescendig the spice merchant was and the whole i will burn this and that  is really starting to go on my nerves the stealing of the dragons didnt wake any emotions we all know she is going to have her dragons back at the house of undying i still have some hope for the prophesies leftrobb oh robb you trully are a king i hate that the show made robb such a lovable character i liked him in the books but the second season showed him in a really good light now i like him even more in the show i have no doubts that jane is the beautiful nurse still not sure what the purpose of the whole hiding of her personality is i gues well have to wait and seeimho this episode was really dynamic dramatic showed some very important moments and despite all the changes from the series it was really greattotally agree about the nurse being jane westerling i would imagine she is concealing her identity as she is from a lannister bannerman house in the northern army plus a noblewoman at that it would enable her to interact amongst the troops a lot more also it creates a sense of intrigue for her character to help the audience connect with her which is needed given her importance in the storyline"

"WinterfellRose",2012-05-13,"id like to say while i liked the episode as a whole i really enjoyed the subtleties the little things that emphasize the story or characters something you might not see on first watching but its there such asi liked the parallel between neds and sir rodricks beheading namely how maester luwin shielded rickon from seeing it such as yoren shielded arya from seeing it last seasoni liked how tywin received lf did not bother calling him lord just baelish winkpng classbbcemoticon alt i liked joffs question about bran being a prince well he kind of is actually but good on sansa to say noi liked how during the riot scene tyrion picked up that shit is coming and ordered tommen back to safety before it beguni loved sandor rescuing sansahow he steadied himself for a second after killing the last guy before turning back to her to say shes all righti loved how his voice quivered a bit when he brought her back to the keep and was telling them she is injuredi liked the way how tywin was portrayed when talking about his father suddenly he seemed like an old tired man fighting a war having to deal with incompetent soldiers and so onit was really getting to him at that moment i thinki dont really care about dany anymore i tend to skip her chapters when rereading and i find myself skipping her scenes when rewatching but i have to say i loved the spice king putting her in her place winkpng classbbcemoticon alt "

"BlackTalon",2012-05-14,"i liked how during the riot scene tyrion picked up that shit is coming and ordered tommen back to safety before it begunsomething else i have noticed  just where exactly is tyrion ordering tommen to be brought the company was on their way back to the red keep from th harbour were they not not the other way round so if joffrey and the others are continuing to the castle  is tommen being brought back to the harbour or what to wait out he riot on the wharfs another instance of thoughtless sloppy writing imho"
"Edmund Cardinal",2012-05-14,"i have two questions one regarding oshas behaviour toward theon once hes taken winterfell and one regarding cersei and tyrion why doesnt she killed him in his sleep before escaping with bran and rickon maybe there are things skipped in the show that were in the book explaining this but i havent read the books yet i will start shortly though same for the decision tyrion made of sending myrcella to dorne wasnt it just a trap to see which of the member or the small council was phony what if baelish had told the queen would tyrion have sent the girl to the eyries and how come cersei cannot stop it where is jeoffrey in all this by the way i miss characters like varys beside that i find jon snow more and more annoying his relationship with his prisoner just doesnt sound right there is something fake about it and i guess the neat face of that sweet ginger girl doesnt help the picture being realistic on the bright side i like the tywinarya duo its a very interesting situation where they both get to know each other but always with that underlying tension because of aryas real indentity tyrion is clever and quite daring but with a kind heart which is a bit of fresh air in the stench of kings landing and his king the execution of rodrick by theon is for me the most powerfull moment of the episode and his last words gods help you theon greyjoy now you are truly lost echoe to my ear everytime i see him the actor alfie allen really does an amazing job edited by edmund cardinal 14 may 2012  1040 am"

"Greyjoy67",2012-05-06,"best of the series so far easily a good 910 a lot more action longer scenes people moving a couple of the previous episodes not all buzzed around too much winterfell scenes were fantastic and ser rodrik had a great death brans screaming luwins plea  it was like a punch in the gut fantastic acting all round riot scene was very well done too and tyrion nailed the part from the book where he just loses it at joffrey ygritte is great aryas scenes were great and baelish turning up actually worked quite nicely  revealed a bit of tywins backstory to the audience established where the tyrells are and provided some more great maisiecharles dance moments theyve also given the dany story some oomph finally because i must admit i didnt give a toss about her in the first few of the series what else talisa is slamming and a certain bastard is confirmed to appear at some point yass"

"MMOWarrior",2012-05-06,"the first ten minutes were the most intense of season two so far this episode did a lot to advance the story scene after scene had the emotion you experience when reading the book"
"Died a Hero",2012-05-06,"8 i liked the riot but hated seeing myrcella crying as she left she wouldntdidnt do that it looks like the dogs makeup was done better this season and his rescue was perfect the siege of winterfell was a bit rushed but all and all done nicely the beheading was brutal theon kicking the stubborn head from its shoulders and brans reaction was perfect plus shaggydog aryas scenes are always prefect and it was cool how they got tywins father story out there without stumbling around with it not to mention the dart in the neck just as the guy hit the front door if youre going to move away from the script this is how you do it i loved hearing that the bastard no never bastard you mustnt call him that of bolton will be involved and not just his father rushing back up the north scenes were ok im not sure why they couldnt have just stuck to the script but whatever i guess jon needed some cockteasing but now im convinced both davids secretly hate dany and will do everything in their power to make her story almost unbearable to watch i love emilia clarke and think she does amazing things with the crap they give her but this episode really was a low point for poor dany she refuses to beglets make her beg she never takes her eyes off her dragonslets get someone to steal them ugg brought what would have easily been a nine maybe even a ten episode down to an eight"
"Lord Godric",2012-05-06,"i gave it a seven a good episode but not the best the winterfell scenes were done brilliantly but there were a few problems and no they are not for me just where the show diverges from the books i like ygrittes character but and this is probably my main gripe of the episode i thought it was confusing if jon tried to kill her and missed or purposely didnt kill her compare that to theons beheading of rodrik and it nearly makes jon look as pathetic as theon did when we all think back to how cleanly ned killed gared in the first episode other than that though i really loved the winterfell scenes so glad to hear that ramsey will be included please let the reeds be too loved the riot scene and especially tyrions rage and although a little weird i liked the littlefingeraryatywin scene looking back now i probably should have given it an 8"

"Ferrum Aeternum",2012-05-06,"i waffled between a 7 and an 8 gave it an 8 because i felt the strengths of the episode in the end won over the weaknesses theon taking winterfell was incredible probably the most intense scene yet in the series and the best opening scene by a wide margin i was absolutely gutted by rodriks execution sequence  the performances and direction were just as visceral and disturbing as such a scene warrants mind blowingthe entire kl riot sequence was fantastic and very much brought to life one of the most memorable scenes from acok tyrionjoff and sansan were both awesome beyond words also hats off to lena headeys ice queen turn with tyrion at the docksunderstated and powerful i was climbing the walls during the lftywinarya scene tywin said something about the tyrells but i didnt hear a word of it cheap thrills maybe but thrilling nonetheless great television im certain lf knows who arya is since he managed to get a pretty good look at her when she spilled the wine plus of course she spoke wouldnt surprise me that lf would keep this information to himself knowing full well the value of exclusive information the 2nd aryatywin scene was pretty good as well although i find it difficult to believe arya wouldnt have thought her cover story ahead any further than she apparently did and furthermore that tywin continues to buy her obvious lies and misdirections or at least not react to them jon and ygrittes stuff was good not great im not wild pardon the pun about the story deviation from the book ie jon not letting ygritte go i do think rose leslie will make a good ygritte though she certainly seems to understand the spirit of the characterthrilled that roose is sending ramsay to retake winterfell if this means we get ramsay next season and beyond then its outstanding newsdanys conclusion scene  wellthe story deviation here sets up a very real and distinct conflict for her to resolve in qarth which would have been more difficult to pull off if the source material had been followed to the letter but something about it feels sloppy i have to admit that just last week during the scene with dany and her handmaidens i wondered about the security of the dragons but didnt think the showrunners would actually go there at this point in the story feels like theyre rushing things ill give them the benefit of the doubt for now but hopefully theyll have a creative solution for resolving this also incidentally i thought emilia clarke chewed the scenery a bit too hard in the scene with the spice king dany is a melodramatic character by design but she pushed it a little too hard for my liking in that scenethe aryalorch scene was another one that seemed unnecessarily rushed and silly pretty much an awful way for jaqen to chalk up kill 2 incidentally jaqen is almost completely wasted in this episode which is also a shame arya snatching the message was beyond stupid and reckless and seemed like a contrivance to get the scene going in the end one genuinely bad scene wasnt enough to ruin the episode for me oh and  although itd be obvious to label talisa as a spy robb even mentions it tongueincheek it would still surprise me if she isnt"

"Tadco26",2012-05-06,"the episode started so strong and fell off the tracks so hard its a shame it really is turning more and more into a story inspired by the books more so than trying to adapt them faithfully i was hoping that season 2 would try to be at least as faithful as season 1 if not more so but it seems the opposite is the case bran and theons scenes were all great over all a great adaptation that kept the spirit of the books even with its changes nitpicking i did wonder why rodrick returned alone to winterfell when he left with 200 men oshas changes worked overall and i am glad they are able to get the wolves more screen time likewise the riot scenes and all the kings landing scenes worked out well there was a kingsguard visable on the boat with myrcella which was a nice touch even if he wasnt named it looks like that was supposed to be the high septon praying as she left and i belive he was the one who lost his arm though i saw no crown so maybe i am wrong the tone and overall action fit well and we got some more screen time for the hound and sansa even the shae and sansa scene worked out pretty well despite me not being a fan of tv shae jons story started out well up to the point that he missed his swing and ygritte escaped rather than being let go now even that would have been acceptable if she had actually escaped but now she is his prisoner and one has to wonder what changes this is going to lead to we already know that qhorin wants to kill her so waiting for the other nights watch to show only delays her death they already made it clear they dont have the food or manpower to guard her as a living prisoner so what is jons plan in keeping her tied up and just as importantly why did the writers decide to change this spoiler is jon going to join the wildlings now it would be a huge change for him to join them under any other circumstances than qhorins orders aryas story line in harrenhal is almost completely original at this point the only real similarities are she is at harrenhal which is under lannister control gendry is a blacksmith and jaqen has offered to kill 3 people for her tv tywin certainly is forgiving of lieing cupbearers littlefinger teleports to harrenhal from renlys camp and appears to recognize arya but that is up to interpretation i have to say i expected littlefinger to stay with the tyrells and negotiate from there maybe send a raven to kings landing or harrenhal arya sees a piece of paper that mentions robb and for some reason decides to take it and doesnt bother hiding it in a pocket or something leading to the contrived death of ser amory by dart at tywins door very sloppy for jaqen considering all his kills before weasel soup look like accidents but he was rushed still he looks very much like a normal man who kills people rather than a mystical assasin at this point we miss out on the magical nature of weasels own dog killing him as well as amorys death by bear a s for ser amory mailing tywins battleplans to the wrong lord why would amory personally be sending ravens and how did he get the idea to send it to the wrong one to send it to any lord he would have to have some ability to read or interpret or did he just pick a lord from a hat and mail it off and hope that was the right one how does tywin know that the wrong lord got it certainly one of robbs lords would not send a mail confirmation at best tywin would get news from the intended lord that he never recieved the letter which could be due to any number of reasons unless the letter was never sent and some one caught the mistake before it left which is not the impression i got watching it danys story is completely off the tracks now and many of the scenes play out like parodies of the book with dany throwing temper tantrums and while the spice kings general reply was both logical and convincing danys actions and attitude make her look like a moron more often than not which is not the impression i got of her at this point in her story reading losing the dragons and what appears to be most of her people makes one wonder if she cant keep them safe even with xaros guards at least in the books then how will she possibly do so with most of her people killed also they have completely dropped the whole part where people from all over the city were coming to visit dany and give her gifts and tribute in exchange for seeing the dragons the episode had some really outstanding scenes some of them were among the best of the entire series it was fairly entertaining tv and some of it was even great but the liberties they are taking with parts of the story and in particular changes which will require even more changes in the future are making this the least faithful adaptation of the books yet and unfortunately none of the major changes were for the better in my eyes"

"Eira Seren",2012-05-07,"gave this one an 8 it seemed to drop off after the first half and i liked it less than last episode the only scene i really disliked was the dany scene where she begs the spice king for ships    she seems perfectly able to negotiate with the other characters in qarth but for some reason always loses her skills when talking with this one why the spice king stole that scene am also a little glad that someone stole the dragons now maybe shell wake up i couldnt even concentrate on the dialogue between tywin and littlefinger could only watch arya so well orchestrated loved the winterfell takeover and the riot the slap was incredibly satisfying and joffs incredible arrogance was even better really think the choice to cut lollys and have sansa be the focus of much of the danger made that scene far more powerful especially when the hound saves her and nobody upstaging her this time wondering if they are planning to keep halfhand around have to laugh though my dad keeps observing that for a bunch of guys out in the cold most of the nw arent smart enough to wear a hat of course not this would mess up jons hair"

"JW.",2012-05-07,"another episode of total hit and miss on certain occasions it just seems that whenever the writers stick to the book and closely adapt it awesome stuff happens but when they start to change stuff and move things around the quality just drops by miles and the famous butterfly effect is all over the place or now butterfly virus  i loved loved ygritte and jon rose leslie did such a great job in those few scenes it lived up my anticipation atleast  alfie allen as theon greyjoy we finally get to see that arrogant prick from the books and he shines that scene with ser rodrik was brutal  tyrion and anything lannister related in kings landing dinklage never fails to disapoint by far the best actor in the series and the most consistent what i didnt like  the total butchery of danys storyline i had a hard time relating to her storyline in the books and finding anything likeable about her the show just made it worse for me personally  ser armory lorch getting killed right infront of lord tywin was this supossed to be a lame attempt at humour  littlefinger speed racing all across the seven kingdoms is there no travel time in this world id reckon with the war going on in the riverlands and all it would take even longer  shae is pointless  robb and talisa from volantis more proof that the writers really should stick close to the books because the changes seem to be utter crap it might sound somewhat of a rant but this season has been such a incredible letdown it really hurts expecations were to high maybe but then again they did such a fine job with season 1 so they sure are capable of a faithfull and decent adaption im giving this episode a 6 out of 10 if baelor was a 9 im not sure how this could be a 8 half of it is amazing the other half subpar the story of the season for me personally so far"

"ipsuel",2012-05-07,"its a 6 for me mainly for the reasons others have already mentioned i loved the winterfell part and think alfie allen played his part to perfection i also loved the tywinarya bits even though they were silly illogical not a fan of the riot but i understand there is only so much budget to go around and i love the lannister storylines so the kl stuff is aok by me but the dany talysa and jon issues killed me most importantly the jon stuff i dont mind changes when necessary or when it improves upon an arc  but jonqhorin is too important to fk with imoso i gave it a 6 and i was probably being generous"
"The Monkey",2012-05-07,"910 the theon scenes were extraordinary and the death of ser rodrick carried almost as much emotion as neds death last season alfie allen has become one of my favourite actors on the show issac hempsteadwright is also doing a fantastic job as bran its so hard to imagine hes only 12 when you see all the horrible child actors in other movies and tvshows its such a relief to see true young talent on this show danys rant was a bit dumb but the twist with the stolen dragons was a nice twist and adds some compelling storylines to what was the worst part in the book aryas scenes were great as always some real tension at her scene with tywin and littlefinger lorchs death was a bit contrived but it gave a good excuse as to why arya didnt name anyone important as her second kill something that bothered me in the book the personal chat between arya and tywin about their fathers was nice and brilliantly acted from both maise and charles as always they are making tywin a bit gentler in the tv show but i dont mind in the least it will only serve to make tyrion and tywins conflict in later seasons all the more powerful as viewers will supposedly root for the both of them the jon scenes were a bit of a drag at times but the wonder scenery more than made up for the wooden acting also the bastard of the dreadfort biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd "

"Ran",2012-05-07,"unless im mistaken david and dan themselves have made a great effort to emphasize that theyre adapting the series and staying true to its spiritthats the benchmark they themselves have set we merely judge them by that benchmark since we are largely a site about the books after all if you take issue with it thats more of an issue with the goals they themselves have articulatedand no amount of ignoring the books makes the lorch sequence any less stupid whether you ignore the books or not it was genuinely lazy stupid writing that insults the intelligence of viewersetaor to put it more simply  dd have articulated two important aims for their adaptation that it maintain the spirit of the novels and that it be good television good television sometimes means compression or outright changes it is true and as ive noted more than once they have made some perfectly good choices in this regard sometimes even inspired ones the brantheon scene combines elements from four different chapters and fits them together in a unique and good wayso judge on those two axes how much does a scene succeed to hew to the spirit of the novels and how good is the scene as television judging the show purely as drama ignores the stated ambitions of the producers just as judging it purely as an adaptation ignores it edited by ran 07 may 2012  0640 am"

"Jamie Lannister",2012-05-07,"nine favourite episode so far theons takeover and fall from grace was brilliantly executed and i love ygritte already the hounds swathe of destruction was brutal and suitably epic and tyrions showdown with joffrey was particularly memorable cant deny that harrenhal was rushed though charles dance continues to dazzle with his tywin but the segments there as a whole came off as pretty silly that was a complete waste of the second death"
"OzorxOron",2012-05-07,"easily my favourite episode of season 2 at the moment id give it a strong 9"
"The Meeraculous Third Reed",2012-05-07,"i am torn in the end im opting for a 7 though it should be much higher pros theon alfie allen is so annoyingly good as theon i am worried he will soon take the place of the character i have in my mind when reading rodriks death was worked in pretty well too though i am perhaps a little worried this will make it a little harder for tv viewers to sympathise with theon later seeing that a tv show cannot provide the inner monologue which is prevalent within much of asoiaf and in general that scene was just a great bit of television all round from the acting to the camera work very good the riot again good acting obvs we have to suspend our disbelief they wouldnt be on horses but other than that it worked very well re myrcella crying i really dont think it would be too farfetched for a young girl to cry when being seperated from her family though perhaps she would wait until she was out of sight the acting of dance and williams more on the content in a bit cons jon and ygritte my main and only problem with this part is the execution or the failed execution simply put we are unaware of why jon missed as such we are being led to believe if we also consider the craster incident that jon is semiincompetent a semiincompetent future lord commander however an explanation an explicit explanation as to whether he did it on purpose will settle this amory lorchs death it works to some degree of sense it provides a reason as to why arya doesnt choose tywin it also suggests that jaqen is pretty awesome at his job it may also give tywin a reason to leave before arya can order his death in every other sense though it failed i think the writers feel the need to shoehorn in harrenhall action scenes when in truth this is not needed at all littlefingers teleportation as for daenerys on the one hand we are seeing earlier than the books what a whiny little brat she is on the other the killing of all her staff by one man its implied seemed wholly unnecessary just stealing the dragons would have made far more sense pyat pree could then also have used his stealing of the dragons without violence as a necessary pretext in order for daenerys to visit and therefore fully understand the importance of the house of the undying"

"ipsuel",2012-05-07,"kinda just wanted to add to my earlier comment i gave it an honest 6 my opinion only  but i really want to add that an honest 6 here for me is like giving a regular show an 11 6 or not its the best show on tv for me"
"Incesticide",2012-05-07,"this is the episode that has beyond any doubt made me decide to stop watching the series while i very much enjoyed the opening scenes the death of rodrik cassel  especially the beheading and the riots  the houndsansas scene especially i cannot abide by the omission of the reeds who add an amazing backstory robbs attraction to the volantene woman the scenes with jon snow and ygritte and the utter and complete disregard to danys storyline whereby the book has been thrown out completely the ending of episode 6 is the exact reason why i am extremely cynical towards tv series in general pertaining to the question at hand i gave the episode a 5 i would have given it less but for the very powerful opening scenes im aware that being a tv series the budget is limited and consequently it would be impossible for the makers of the series to include every battle and every minor character there were changes from the storyline i happily accepted which i felt improved theons letter burning scene and the aryatywin scenes were particularly noteworthy or alternatively summarised things well yorrens death and aryagendrys capture im aware in the words of neil gaiman that grr martin is not my bitch and that he gives the go ahead to benioff and weiss for each episode  which means that he approves of the changes its his story and i respect his decision im also aware that unconstructive ranting is not going to be listened to by the makers of the series mainly because the viewership is increasing that said my opinion is my own and i watch and read things for my personal pleasure the series seems to be heading towards some drastic modifications of parts of the storyline  modifications to the world i imagined when i read the books as such from now on ill stick with the books edited by incesticide 07 may 2012  0754 am"

"sh3rpa of The North",2012-05-07,"youve been bitten by the book purist bug take the antidote quicklybut we love the books a desire for the series to remain faithful to the source material is fair while reading the books i didnt spend the whole time saying to myself martin should have done this differently if the changes are done for practical purposes it can come off nicely but when the changes manipulate the plot and possibly eliminate favorite moments people have a right to and probably will be disappointedi have always enjoyed dany chapters a pretty unpopular opinion around here and found the dragon stealing to lower her competence to an unacceptable level she is competent to me at this point in the story dont shoot i immediately understood that this is a lead in to the undying but i still dont like how it hurts your opinion of the characters involved this same reasoning applies to events at harrenhall tywin and jaq have been made to look like novices610 tyrion and theon save it"

"Sand11751",2012-05-07,"a nine poor theon he cant get anything right respect from anybody or chopping off someones head pleased to see that someone looks like hes getting tired of being called a dog his rescue of sansa was so him  there could have been a less brutal way i guess but thats what you get for messing with sansa when the hounds around also i love the continued interaction between arya and tywin for the actress to hold her own in scenes with such a veteran is really promising for her future if littlefinger didnt make the connection hes an idiot and hes definitely not an idiot cant wait to see ramsay snow i mean bolton and hopefully reek in the new season my one quibble  robbs flirting with talisa  jeyne  is just boring id much rather see him and greywind torment jaime"
"TheEvilKing",2012-05-07,"liked this episode i gave it an 85 yes i realise thats not on the scale so had to give it an 8  just didnt quite have that 9 factor for me good stuff  by the gawds what an opening i love the shot of theons face after executing rodrik so intense  ramsay corpsefuckin bolton pretty much confirmed  love the shake up in qarth makes it much more exciting  the harrenhal scenes were all great  the riot scenes were intense and scary and dope as fuck cersei threatening tyrion tyrion steppin to joff sansa almost gangraped the high septon getting torn to shreds an old man getting punched and the hound finally getting to kick some ass  tulisa wasnt as annoying this episode theres hope yet not so good stuff  jon snow scenes are boring yet again i like ygritte so far though  irri i hope shes not dead  shae sucks bring ros back"

"Linda",2012-05-07,"i must admit im having real problems following elios and lindas recaps latelylet me say that i have great respect for their enthusiasm love and knowledge of the martins world their reviews are thorough wellwritten and interesting to readbut lately they are sounding more and more like uberfans that have trouble separating books and tv i dont know what it is but the nature of their critiques is increasingly becoming impenetrable and hard to follow silly and excessive nitpicking is piling up and overall sense of thats not how it was in the books is really starting to grate on mefor my own part i have said from the start that i am completely uninterested in watching or commenting on this show just on its own merits i am only interested in how well  or not  it adapts the books we watch the show as fans of the books we review it as fans of the books thats itthis does not mean it has to follow the letter but it better follow the spirit of the story and stay true to the characters the start to episode 6 is an example of excellent adaptation which compresses and changes but stays true to the story and the charactersif you just want a bit of action well whatever"
"The Rune Maester",2012-05-07,"considering i still havent read the books i would give this episode a 910 because it was incredibly engaing and dynamic yes perhaps tywin is a little bit too tolerant and arya holding the note in her hand is quite annoying but overall great acting for maisie theons conquest was so dramatic and bloodied it makes you shiver perhaps bran acted more like a modern child rather than a medieval one good point from an earlier comment posted here but it definitely made the scene much more emotional oh and theons butchering horridcercei gave the best icecold and bitter look she could and tyrion slapping joff again was priceless we need more kingslaps the hound coming to the rescue was such a reliever as the rape scene looked quite authentic although you cannot deny he acted more like a terminator than a knightjon and ygritte were so cute im jealous of ygritte for rubbing her butt to jon but then again she is an incredibly beautiful and temperamental wildling 3 however jon capturing ygritte instead of letting her escape is a deviation from the story as far as i know and it would be interesting to see how it will progress and dany oh god from what i read in this topic dany is much more shrewd and smart in the books than she is in season 2 all this whining empty threats and the perfectly logical and convincing replies of the spice king definitely undermined the character with her dragons stolen now im quite curious to see how she will reclaim them hopefully the house of the undying is coming soon smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  but yeah tvdany is too whiny acting more like a teenagegirl at the moment rather than a khaleesi and a mother of dragons overall the episode was very exciting much more dynamic in the first half with small bits of romance flowing in the air and puddles of blood soaking winterfell and kings landing it is a bit sad to know that some important parts of the plot are being changed in the tvseries hopefully hbo will be more faithful to the books for the last 4 episodes of the season despite a few awkwardunconvincing moments and some book deviations it was a very exciting and entertaining episode  910"

"Scooby",2012-05-07,"honestly it was not as good as i hoped it would be the scene with arya threw me off and the stuff about danys dragons being stolen it doesnt seem to fit i am pretty understanding when it comes to changing things for tv however it seems like somethings are added just for the added tension and not adding to the storytelling and condensing i will watch it again and see how i feel after that but for now it was a bit disappointing btw even when got is disappointing it is still the best thing on tv"

"Ran",2012-05-07,"i dont rest my feelings on myrcella or anything like that  but we do try to be complete in noting all changes that included and as greywolf says that actually helps define myrcella but the lorch scene is bad tv badly staged and badly written with a humorous tone thats illbefitting the spirit of the novels can you imagine grrm having written that scene and playing it for a laugh as the show did i cant and so it fails both tests badly i find it unaccountable how so few critics have noticed the lazy dissonant writing of the lorch scene and the one before it for that matter but in any case it felt symptomatic of an episode that leaned too heavily on contrivances that would get mad men or breaking bad or justified taken to the woodshed by critics if scenes that were as contrived and clumsy made it onto those shows and again there was some terrific writing in there which is why the unevenness is all the more disappointing in the end its a sea of opinions read the ones that speak to you and hang the rest edited by ran 07 may 2012  1201 pm"

"Hyper",2012-05-07,"ran im curious why you seem to think that aryas scenes in this episode are almost objectively bad are they from reading many recaps from reviewers and seeing tumblr and twitter reactions  and as you noted it seems to be a highlight of the episode for many this seems to be a case where your dislike of the change  details causes you to dismiss the whole set of scenes as bad but not just pad poorly plotted contrived and filled with false tension a bit strong imo many scenes adapted more faithfully from the book could easily be argued as being contrived but as book readers we are ok with it edited by hyper 07 may 2012  0221 pm"
"Lord Hodor",2012-05-07,"but ran adaptations are notorious for veering did you read grrms intro to the graphic novel he acknowledges changes have to be made when switching to new mediums if you dont take the show as its own entity youre not going to enjoy iti do not agree with this grrm did not write the ultimate fantasy story as good as it is you can make a tv show based or inspired by it and either make it better exactly the same or worse in this case i belive as many others do that it was made worseyou can enjoy an adaptation any adaptation if its done well as an improvement or an addition to the original story a way to say thank you for writting this heres a little movie we did in its honor if it changes for the worse which many people belive it does its not so much a thank you but a f you heres how were gonna change your carefully thought out story for money and belive it or not people take issue with thati didnt find this episode good the early aspects of winterfell though very well done felt so rushed they just show up inside winterfell in broad daylight dragging wounded ser rodrick around like its no thing what happened to the deception from cleftjaw how did theons one boat crew defeated the 200 winterfell forcearya and tyrion scenes much like their chapters in the books always save the day being the highlights of the whole thinglorch littlefinger teleporting and danys scenes were the low points edited by lord hodor 07 may 2012  0237 pm"
"Mr Fixit",2012-05-07,"what is not the point of it i honestly cannot see why that is a question we are first and foremost fans of the books and we watch it as an adaptation to review it in any other context would be pointless for us i am not interested in the tvshow on its own merits it cannot exist on its own meritsive been watching tv shows and reading books for some decades now and while i respect your opinion and your right to have it that kind of inflexible approach to source material often proves to be pretty detrimental not really the best examples i admit but i am reminded of all the sound and fury deep space nine was subjected to because its not really star trek and because it betrayed roddenberrys vision or the bashing the reimagined battlestar galactica endured as it was called gino galactica in name only by all means put the books at the front of your considerations all nice and dandy but please do try to avoid some of the pitfalls you seem to repeatedly fall into"
"Ran",2012-05-07,"i dont have a problem with the changes though which is why its frustrating talking with people who harp on it amory lorch being the second victim not a problem arya and tywin good scenes although i admit i think theyre in danger of going to that well too often  why not have her interact with gendry or hot pie a bit too but badly staged television is badly staged no one can come up with a credible reason why arya can run around freely through a crowd of lannister soldiers just milling about lorch chasing and shouting at her and no one does anything he doesnt think to maybe just tell one of those guards she keeps bumping into to grab her etc this was illconsidered it was sloppy lazy writing that most people dont care is i suppose a blessing for them but i noticed it right out and i was left wondering how in the world that scene made it to air without the tweaks needed to make it work properly in any case its not about changes its about scenes that work and scenes that dont work and sometimes the scenes that dont work are faithful to the tone but just poorly written or badly acted and sometimes scenes that do work arent especially faithful but theyre really good the lorch sequence was neither faithful nor particularly good and im baffled that people number it as among their favorites in the episodes but thats why there are different strokes for different folks folks finally were one review among many and i think weve explained our approach to reviewing pretty well i think like it or lump it we should move on to letting people just say what they rated which is the ostensible purpose of the thread edited by ran 07 may 2012  0229 pm"
"snapdragon",2012-05-07,"once again i completely disagree no changes of any true relevance especially not enough to justify a claim that its becoming merely inspired by the booksother than the dragon theft there werent any major changes and im confident that will turn out for the besttrue relavence is relative i guess to some people having danys dragons stolen robbs love storyline completely different from what martin originally wrote littlefinger popping up everywhere you look leaving out meera and jojen and possibly even skipping the important stuff with the halfhand is acceptable to cut from the showto me it feels like the writers of the show are simply saying my version of a song of ice and fire is better than martins i can pretty much gurantee youre wrong if you say otherwise why else would they make so many lame changes"

"DemiNymph",2012-05-07,"7 it was a pretty meh episode nothing much happens or rather nothing big happens the highlight of the show was the wolves and seeing the little bastard joffery getting slapped again woohoo arya  tywin is always a pleasure as mentioned the whole armory lorch sequence should have been coordinated better its a sloppy execution but i can still suspend my disbelief for a while since its tv yigritte was good much better than expected tv jon snow is a wuss its better that he just let her go like in the books so now tv jon snow cant make good decisions he cant even tie her up properly geez theon is getting quite detestable but thats good its just like in the books the whole winterfell conquest was meh not much drama nor is the escape danys storyline still meh dragons got stolen yeah i dont buy it but its ok since i dont care much for her storyline cant really remember anything else that went on it is a good transitional episode thats all"

"Dragon greyscale",2012-05-07,"ot best episode so far i gave it a 9 arya and danys storyline have improved for the better the rest was enthralling as well highlight was yet again tywin and arya especially with the suspense revolving lf on the eternal purist vs apologist discussion i think many here are judging the show according to the two axes proposed by ran spirit of books and merit as television the difficulty of the first axis is that it will never be resolved what the spirit of the novels is its a very vague criterion is myrcella at the core of asoiafs spirit i dont think so but for others it is or are we talking about broader themes like the ambiguity of morality and the dirty game of politics how far do you take it the spirit may seem selfevident but it really is not and even if there is a general consensus about that spirit does that mean it is without flaws i doubt it considering all the disussions on the general boards is affc boring or not is danys storyline entertaining or not are the iron islands and dorne interesting or not these questions all have proponents and detractors this issue is more related to the second axis the merit dd have made their own choices about all these questions their definition of the spirit may differ from other readers and what is more they think they can tweek it to appeal to a broader audience i think that is totally legitimate and im enjoying it so far its not perfect but no tv show is"

"Serc",2012-05-07,"best episode of season 2 worth a 10everything was done fantastically it had action and drama and a sense of flow that the other episodes havent matched the book changes are done well qarth might just end up not being one uninteresting bore with her dragons stolen as well i always wondered why they didnt take them in the books tywins actor dominates the screen hes easily the best actor in the entire castarya stealing the letter lolwat why not just read the damn thing and leave it there when the letter goes missing its not like tywin isnt going to immediately know who stole it and of course amory had it on him when he died in front of tywin nice save by jaqen thoughi cannot comprehend the people expecting this to be like the books or claiming that it betrays grrms vision newsflash grrm has done things extremely poorly hes had bad scenes bad characters and bad nonsensical plot this is a second runthrough and i highly suspect theyre polishing and fixing things hes had issues with you cant show half of what the books do purely because theyre revealed through monologue or else too subtle for the screen this necessitates changes and a change from his vision due to both limited time and the medium the show should be more entertaining and action packed than the books while still retaining as much of the intriguing plot as possible and thats what theyre doing it shouldnt try to be as in depth or deep because it wont be able to manage iti will bet money to the effect that brienne will not be wandering the riverlands in the show that was while important in the books boring for the showthat said yes this show had some issues something that stood out for me was the guys arm getting torn out during the riot the rest of the riot was done marvelously but i just had to shake my head at that part jon missing with his strike just strikes me as him being incompetent as mentioned the letter and arya however none of these flaws were big enough to merit more than a flash of irritation the episode was great"

"BoldAsYouPlease",2012-05-07,"yes i completely agree with this statement if we were seeing myrcella being shipped off cheerfully as she was in the books it would have diminished the emotional impact of cerseis venomous words towards tyrion moments later sometimes the show improves on the books and i think this was one of those moments its much more realistic to have a girl cry as shes leaving her family and all that she knows than to have her chirping and happythe myrcella of the books is a dignified little princess  she might not have been happy about being shipped off to dorne but she didnt cry like a little girl of our times would the scene is jarring  it makes tyrion look like an unfeeling man who uses his niece as a pawn regardless of the impact on her but doesnt provide the context that this was how all the children of the nobility in that world are treated and raised to expect the emotionalism of today is not the norm for that world or for most of the history of this world  children were expected to grow up work and act like small adults at a much earlier age"
"PatrickStormborn",2012-05-07,"if they had shown myrcella looking perfectly happy that she was being shipped off the audience would not think she was strong  they would think she was a poor actress and it would look incredibly jarring with cersei and tyrions dialogue the scenes in kings landing were really hard to watch because i felt so sorry for sansa i was surprised that they went so far as to show her almost being raped after they chickened out on showing the repeated beatings she took from joffrey it was sweet of tyrion to be so concerned for her although he was probably more worried about what would happen to jaime if something happened to sansa i kind of feel sorry for nikolaj costerwaldau  hes only been in one episode out of 6 and im getting a feeling he wont appear again until the last one of the season at least it shows that the writers arent afraid to get rid of certain characters for a significant amount of episodes  makes me wonder how they will handle theonsreeks arc later on jaimes in the next episode and i suspect hell be in 8 and 10 as well meaning hed be in 4 out of 10 episodes  the same as melisandre"

"Drogon's Personal Trainer",2012-05-07,"a 9 from me  ive finally seen it i loved the pace and the fact that certain scenes were given more room to develop as opposed to the choppy editing of the first couple of episodes i was dreading rodriks beheading  as its my particular bete noire  but i thought it was well done and brans pleading was heartbreaking the little lord became a little boy helpless to save a respected friend didnt mind the riot scene without horses  it would have been near impossible to film but i do agree that the royals walking abroad gave a flavour more akin to ancient rome where magistrates did walk the streets accompanied by their lictors than a pseudomediaeval worlds mores however i think they did their best within these constraints and once the action got going i forgot all about that sansas near rape was particularly terrifying  far more so for me than the tearing apart of the high septon again rather like the roman mob tearing livius drusus limb from limb or the poet cinna and i do have a soft spot for sansan so the rescue went down well among the three gals who watched this in my house loved rose leslie she rescued ygritte for me she took a character from the book whom i loathed with a passion and made me like her  so thats another plus i dont mind danys story being pepped up with the stealing of her babies nor do i mind that theyve put her into viserys mode  she needs to be taken down a peg or two now and learn to mature which i am sure the show writers will do to our satisfaction one hopes im a dany supporter in any case even though i know shes far from flawless i dunno  i just connect with her plight there are always nitpicks  even on a 9 05 for each amory lorchs death i think i can see where ran was coming from with his crit of this  purely as tv nothing to do with book adaptations it certainly did look comical when he keeled over with the dart in his neck i did actually giggle but perhaps we were supposed to so the jurys out on that one 05 off also for how outoftheblue the attack at xxds house was wed had no inkling that would happen really  or if we had i missed it so when those doors opened on the corpses it felt a wee bit clumsy to me another awkward thing for me is alfie allen  still on the one hand if you close your eyes and listen to his delivery it can be quite woeful thinking of the character in the book however i have to be generous here and say that he does nail the gloriously inept theon one receives this portrayal with a mixture of hatred and pity which i think it right  so ill give alfie the benefit of the doubt i would certainly not be in the give him an award camp not by a long shot but he is doing his best i just wish he could be more consistent he has flashes of sheer brilliance and then we get the wooden delivery again but to carp on about it would be churlish hes getting the character across so ill shut up about it the reason ive given it 9 is because i was still engrossed with each unfolding storyline and swore like a troooper at each commercial break on sky and as a spectacle and acting vehicle notwithstanding a few tiny nits i rated it highly the producers have got an awful lot to do with the sprawling mess in a nice way that was clash of kings and although there may have been some trimming it has been spared major butchery imho on to next week  and hopefully the return of our jaime"
"Lord Barristan",2012-05-07,"i really liked this episode i gave it an 8 the only reason it doesnt get a better grade is because some of the stuff if just plain bad robbs storyline is painful what were they thinking to accomplish with talisa its a train wreck imo i cant stand carcetti as lf i think he is doing a terrible job and the writing is bad too im not trying to be a book snob but imo one of the things that makes lf so awesome inn grrms world is that we dont know what hes doing or what hes planning we as the readers are left in the dark i get the impression these lf scenes are being added just for the sake of the actors undeserved salary i never liked this guy as carcetti and i like him less as lf as for the bastard of the bolton if he is going to appear why didnt they just do it like the book i missed him pledging his sword to theon that made the later betrayal more shocking im not just saying this as a fan of the books my favorite tv show of all time is the wire i think asoif as grrm wrote is like the wire of fantasy the tv show doesnt give me that feel everything is so spelled out for the audience its not that the show isnt great i love it but it could be more if david simon were writing this i know he wouldnt but if he were this show would be 1110 every week this is hbo for gods sake leave some ambiguity for the audience its not cbs of tnt i know its still complex but the wire and the sopranos left a lot up to interpretation dont see why dd dont do that the positives for me were the kl riot dinklage and joff were great theon continues to be my favorite story line maisie williams is the perfect arya charles dance is the perfect tywin rose leslie was awesome too i cant wait see rattleshirt edited by lord barristan 07 may 2012  0605 pm"

"Corvinus",2012-05-07,"i have officially given up comparing the plot of the books with that of the show the only thing im still hanging on to is the character portrayal i never liked how renly was portrayed and for the new characters i dont like roose bolton because he is too lively and i am not sure about xaroi am giving this episode 10 and should probably give better grades to the previous ones too it was exciting and entertaining actually the episode deserves a 10 on joffrey getting slapped alonei loved the interaction between tywin and arya and lorchs timely assassination the scene in the streets of kings landing and especially the hound rescuing sansa was gold also jon  ygritte were funny i didnt quite like how the episode began it felt too rushed but rodriks execution was a powerful moment i am not sure what to think about danys last scene but one could wonder why this didnt happen in the book as well edited by corvinus 07 may 2012  0738 pm"

"TeamDanyArya",2012-05-07,"i gave it an 8 mainly due to robbs stuff i know they have to show the audience what happens because if it had been faithful to the books people would have been lost as hell i understand why they are doing this but i dont think robb and the actress playing talisajeyne whoever have that much chemistry at all overall i like the deviations from the book i think in context of the show it works and i think for once a lf deviation made sense i was genuinely worried they would deviate too much from the book and have sansa take the place of lollys i kept telling my husband the hound has to show up or someone if they have sansa get raped im going to be pissed thankfully the hound came in i also didnt like how rushed jons storyline was i had hoped the introduction of ygritte would be either next episode or even later but i got it this week but ygritte rocks and i just laughed so hard with her little um routine"
"SerArthurHeath",2012-05-07,"10 for me the best episode so far in either season the changes all improved the story imo and the acting was sublime i think this episode easily outstripped this section of the written story how the hell did dany get away without having her dragons nicked in qarth in the books for one thing glorious"
"House Snow",2012-05-07,"im watching the wire now and while its a great show it avoids the criticism bc its a cool gangster show and not a fantasy show the truth is there are so many things that happen in the wire that are ridiculous and completely unbelievable even moreso that got but the genre gives it a shield of armor i mean omar alone is the most impossible and ridiculous character ever if you put a broadsword in his hand and not a shotgun people would see this"

"Davos55",2012-05-08,"i finally watched the episode this morning and i will give it an 8 for now the episode had some great scenes particularly in winterfell and kings landing alfie allen continues to impress me and i felt the opening to the episode was harrowing and very well done i enjoyed the riot scene mostly due to the hound finally getting some well deserved screen time and for tyrion getting to slap joffrey again i am on the fence about danys storyline right now but it has potential to turn out good i suppose the fact that irri may be dead thoughthat really pisses me offit is known that she is alive and well after qarthand i like her a lot i am holding onto hope that she may just have been knocked outbut i wont hold my breath the mention of rooses bastard sandor and shaggydog all could have brought this episode to a 9 or 10but i felt that jons storyline in this episode was illogical and poorly written i wont say that it deviated so far that it cant end up like it did in the novels but i must say i am worried about it right now more than i thought possible overall great episode and worthy of an 8 in my opinion"

"Eira Seren",2012-05-09,"i applaud the honesty of this post i do think all of us are guilty sometimes of taking things too seriously on these episodes threads  im as guilty as everyone else the twop forums also seem to be in line with the sites original purpose an area in which things arent taken too seriously people just enjoy the show and can still poke gentle fun at some of the more ludicrous aspects i find it comical for instance that people can object to magical shadow assassins yet accept a girl walking through fire to hatch dragon eggs as an everyday occurrence almost winkpng classbbcemoticon alt  each to his ownas for my stance  here we go some people have asked why certain episodes of the present series can be given high marks in the poll i cant speak for anyone else nor would i have the arrogance to do so but for my own part i vote between 810 purely on entertainment value to me personally plus i am voting in context when i know its hbo i know its gloriously glossy flashy and deliciously trashy tv i mean that in the best possible way  a guilty pleasure always visually gorgeous always takes liberties gratuitous tits the compulsory lesbian scene to get the guys salivating vivid mindless violence etc etc but thats hbo im going to judge it within its context not compare it to downton abbey or superlative serious  ahem dramas of the past on both sides of the atlantic the same applies to the books they are enjoyable genre fiction not shakespeare or classics i judge them within their context too i love the major characters adore the worldbuilding forgive the occasional descent into soap opera and constant repetitionsone thing i have to say in praise of the show after seeing series 1 i read all the books in a genre i would never have tried in a million years scifi and fantasy never interested me for years apart from the obligatory lotr reading that we all go through as teenagers  and while held as a classic personally that bored me senseless i am sure that george must be pleased to know that the hbo show has helped him sell even more books because im not the only one who was turned on to the addiction that is asoiaf by the tv series now like everyone else i am anxiously awaiting the release of wow i know there will be parts  like in all the books  that will make me roll my eyes even giggle at the odd absurdity these little lapses dont spoil my enjoyment of the books they actually add to it what a dork quentyn was thinking he could tame dragons but how gloriously touchingly heroic he was to try the books have peaks and troughs  far more peaks so i keep readingthe show is the same do i really want to spoil my overall enjoyment by analysing how ravens get from a to b or do i just want to watch an overall story developing and embrace it complete with its flaws for the addictive entertainment it isso yep  i think our own personal expectations come into this those who have made george into one of the seven will be far stricter in their criticism i know where theyre coming from my passion is roman history and i swore at the tv screen during the first two episodes of rome and stopped watching then i gave it another go and tried to forget all my training in ancient history and just watched it as a story it improved for me then and i could see the good bitsi dont hold george to be a god i thoroughly enjoy his saga and i know that without it there wouldnt be a tv series at all but i suppose because im not as passionate as other devotees i dont judge with the same harsh criteria i dont hold hbo to be immortal either i know what ill be getting and judge accordinglyjust my two pennorthwell i guess my expectations are kindof high i have to confess its good entertainment and good tv like spartacus its also good writing and story like deadwood at some level for me at least the series has surpassesed what i think of as tv in fact i dont watch as much tv as i used to because a lot of it even some of my old standbys dont seem that great for this series im not just in it for the entertainmentand supernerd that i am its the same way for me with the novels they are surpassingly entertaining yes they are also as powerful at times as what we deem literature theres as much in here as my favorite victorian novels i enjoy from an entertainment and critical standpoint grrms series as much as i do shakespeare and tolstoy and as byatt i can read these with a pencil in hand actually i may as well confess i actually have and theres plenty to find sure its popular fiction but its very fine writing as well and the questions it asks of us readers are often just as compelling as the ones we find in literary worksstill has plenty of guilty pleasure moments thoughthe purpose of art is to inform and delight  horace edited by eira seren 09 may 2012  1049 pm"

"Thunderfist",2012-05-10,"the freys dont care if robb has sex with some nurse an infatuation is meaningless as long as robb is willing to follow through on his oath to the freysi agree with you that the freys probably wouldnât mind if robb had sex with some random lowborn girl to blow off some steam or whatever however i do believe that one or two eyebrows would be raised about the fact that robb is obviously falling in love with this girl and that heâs showing this in public in front of everyone the freys might not have reason to believe that he will end up marrying this girl but i am certain that they would see it as worrying and as an insult"
"Kvothe the Arcane",2012-05-10,"great episode definitely one of the best of this series so far loved the theon qhorin and riot scenes particularly the ser rodrik scene was an excellent change helped flesh out theons situation in winterfell however i am finding the daenerys storyline just as dull as i did when i first read cok the fleshing out of it they are doing is taking away from the much more engaging westeros based action delighted ramsay snowbolton is making it into this season though the reeds will be missed in the course of the season though if osha replaces them in brans storyline it just will not make sense on screen with all her characterisation from the first series it would just look insane to take the character along with bran all in all though probably my favourite episodes or both series the geographical and character switches really worked brilliantly in this one"
"packersfan",2012-05-10,"good point about the freys and robbthis nurse just makes the story less believable what would the freys care if he fools around with a foreign nurse however look in the books their issue is that he fools around with jeyne westerling and then feels compelled to marry her as the honorable thing to do and the fact that he falls for her the issue is the marriage one of my friends thinks they put this nurse in so they could introduce this romance in the second season rather than the third third book is when it all happens really why we dont have enough other things to keep us appetized we really need an even dumber romance this is going to make robb look even stupider than he was in the books when he broke his oath with the freys as for osha bran rickon and hodor and the lack of reeds i think this is going to problematic my friend thinks that they must run into the reeds later next seasonhbo didnt want to hire more child actors maybe this season since in the books osha and rickon go one way and the reeds bran and hodor go north how will that work without the reeds also remember that eventually davos is dispatched by manderly of white harbor to find rickon hopefully the writers have only rearranged events a little and not completely bungled up these seemingly little things which could have far greater impact as for jon and ygritte i saw someone saying that it made no sense that halfhand and the other rangers would leave jon to execute her but this is how it happened in the book however hbo changed it by having her then escape and jon chasing in the book he lets her go they dont meet up again or start any relationship until he joins up with mance rayder are they just extending the time they spend together before he lets her go if so how are they going to explain that time to the other rangers when he let her go in the book it was fast jon was able to say he finished her off or did he say she got awayeither way there was no suspicious long time where jon was separated from the group seems the writers are anxious and impatient to tell parts of the story they are really excited about instead of taking their time and letting the story get there i really think the show is a million times easier to watch when you havent read the books it is nice to know what will happen and who everyone is but at the same time it is a major letdown when you know what happens next or should happen next and then the hbo writers produce a major twist that completely alters that story oh well maybe i should just go back to nitpicking about movies and shows based on history that fabricate and completely change historical occurences for entertainment purposes like benjamin rush in the john adams miniseries being alive after abigail adams died despite him dying in the real world before her oh hbo sheesh edited by packersfan 10 may 2012  1007 pm"

"Travy1991",2012-05-07,"im pretty sure oona chaplins character is jeyne westerling but using the name talisa for some mysterious reason yet to be revealed jeyne in the books is a bit of a nonentity so i dont mind them making the character a bit more feisty and giving her her own little subplot if need be"
"Independent George",2012-05-07,"robb asked her name she says talisa maegi unsure how to spell it  pronounced mayguy i think this means shes definately jeyne westerling her grandmother maggy the frog a maegi her grandmother travelled from the east where talisa claims shes from not a complete lieits just a theory but plausiblei hope its jeyne otherwise theyre losing out on an awesome future storylinei heard a maegi too and sat up straight once i realized what it meant there was an extra syllable at the end  it sounded more like maegia  but its definitely a variation on maegi"

"Bastard of Boston",2012-05-07,"imo shes clearly lying about her identity please also refer to the previously on package before the episode they chose to include the soundbite of her riding away announcing her name i believe its very telling that this choice was made add that to the awkwardness of her exchange with catelyn and the fact that robb accuses her of being more than she lets onoh and then theres the letter she was trying her best to put out of sight as if she was just caught with her hand in the cookie jar so much is at play herethese scenes arent simple opportunities for robb and talisa to make googly eyes at one another  this is all leading somewhere i believe shes a westerling at this point whether they choose to keep her first name as jeyne i dont know given the oshaashayara situation they may option to change jeyne westerling into somethingelse westerling due to jeyne poole i think theyre trying to turn jeyne into a plant shes probably being forced to report to tywinmaybe he has her family hostage so shes doing what she needs to doalas she falls for the northern king making her deception that much more difficult for her as far as the cliche of this relationship for me its no less cliche than it is in the book robb storms the crag falls for the forbidden fruit in a moment of weakness and sees it through this is pretty much a replay only the show is endeavoring to make the westerling character more compelling by turning her into a proactive spy instead of a bland weepy robb fangirl edited by bastard of boston 07 may 2012  1023 pm"
"victim",2012-05-07,"if the rumours are true and theyve changed jeyne to actually be a lannister of lannisport ugh then i suspect that reginald lannister who tywin dismissed in ghost of harrenhal is her father he was never mentioned in the books and im pretty sure hes been created solely for the television show it would annoy me is it that inconvenient to state that the westerlings are sworn bannermen to the lannisters it seems as though robb falling for the enemy is a situation being purposefully compared to jon and ygrittes romance edited by victim 07 may 2012  1032 pm"
"Patchface12",2012-05-07,"i like the idea that reginald lannister is jeynes father since tywin sent him home maybe he gets captured by robbs men on the way and becomes one of the karstark murders along with alton so it would be robb who was consoling jeyne this way around or maybe he heard about bran and rickons death and it would be a mutual kind of thing plus that could really explain why robb puts karstark to death"

"Bambi",2012-05-08,"also i got the vibe that the letter regarding robb stark on tywins table at harrenhal bore some resemblance the the papers that talisa was writing while in robbs camp  the same papers that she was anxiously trying to hideroll up while simultaneously flirting with robb you see the writing only from a distance or illuminated from the other side but as best i can tell the look and shape of the paper and the handwriting looks awfully similar as best i can tellalso this way they dont have to show robb storming a lesser castle then being nursed by jeyne which would be time consuming and expensivenice catch about the letter but i checked and the shape and size of the papers are totally different also when talissa rolls the letter she has a faint and shy smile the acting suggests she really has some impressions from robbbut the letter has a meaning apart from the previous someone before me posted the most probable storyline she is spying but she will regret it when falls in love with robb and the passionate menace begins xdohh and by the way she is truly jeyne westerling with a fake name see it in the season 2 cast httpwwwimdbcomlistu7kq7k8qfwa edited by iszlai adam 08 may 2012  0457 am"

"Magic 8 Ball",2012-05-08,"oh yeah  now i recall that the letter tywin had mentioned robb stark by name while jeynes letter said the young wolf i doubt that she would alternate aliases for robb so the connection to tywins letter is probably tenuous at best with regards to writing it out in the open she probably wanted better light to write it in and ducking into a tent to write a letter in dim light could arouse suspicion all on its own she probably didnt anticipate that 2 of the 1 of people in camp who were literate would come sneaking up on her like that robb probably did that to check out her backside while she was kneeling over"

"bloodofthedragonqueen",2012-10-24,"got season two reminded me an awful lot of this show i watched as a kid the bold and the beautiful it had phenomenal ratings and because of this the producers tried to squeeze out as much money as they could by stretching the plot lines as far as possible due to advertising each scene infamously ends with drawn out stares dramatic pauses and unfinished sentences following a scene cut the characters seemingly improvise the exact same scene as before as though the confrontation never happened just to draw out the climax you may also be interested to know george rr martin was a soap opera writer in hollywood before he started game of thrones anyone who has read the last two books may get some closure from this information hah talisa also has a horse face bad casting there i have no idea why they changed it because robb didnt even find out about his bros deaths so he just looks like a douche now  same as catelyn how will viewers sympathise with her i hate how they have made them all unlikeable robb deserves to die for being so arrogant in the show and i hate talisa for being so dumb and selfish she knew he was engaged i wish the unappealing talisa would die instead of cat and robb ps if she was meant to seduce him why was she such a bitch when she first met him and then ran away bad writing bad writing"

"LordStoneheart",2012-11-02,"i truly believe talisa is jeyne and heres why 1 the maegyrmaegijeyne w had ancestors in essos yada yada 2 she asks robb if she can go with him on his next war outing at one point he agrees later in the camp when catelyn is trying to save jamie from death at the hands of karstark he questions why robb isnt there catelyn says you know as well as i do that hes gone to the crag to negotiate a surrender the crag surrender in the books robb meets jeyne sybil and gawen at the crag its like nod to talisas real identity 3 the letter im not going to debate what she wrote or if it has anything to do with the letter arya stole but think about it every screen shot matters this is a highprofile highbudget show what was the reason they specifically showed her writing a letter in the camp and a few seconds later had her mockingly say shes a spy and robb found her out maybe just an excuse for flirtation dialogue but the letter isnt brought up again if talisa doesnt turn out to be jeyne then the above information is awfully strange to put in the show im hoping she is mostly because im still annoyed rhaegars series title drop wasnt shown in the house of the undying and weasel soup didnt make an appearance i still love the show though"
"King of the Road",2012-11-04,"is it not just possible that talisa is jeyne albeit with a different name and background to fit in with oona chaplins look the letter is clearly just flirtatious banter and however clichad thats all it will ever be having robbs wife as being a spy would be too detrimental to the story i seriously dont see the problem with this the robbtalisa storyline is a small part of a larger show ultimately so long as talisa fulfils the same role as jeyne then what does it matter"
"Cregan Quagg",2012-11-04,"id like to point out that the creators as well as martin himself view talisa as a completely new character even though she partly fills jeynes role george martin himself came up with the name talisa maegyr the maegyrs are a known volantene highranking family one of the current triarchs in volantis malaquo is a maegyr of course she could still be scheming with tywin but that would feel like a retcon for many viewers they should have dropped some hints in s2 to make that believable imho the letter thing is sort of weakhttpawoiafwesterdexphpmalaquo"
"ACVG",2012-11-20,"perhaps talisa was added by grrm and dd for the readers to keep us guessing we know all the plot twists up to book 5 at least if her name remained jeyne westerling we would know exactly what her role would be but since almost everything is changed about her save for her relationship and eventual marriage with robb it keeps us guessing is she a spy or not does she die in the rw or not things we know sybelle spicer worked with tywin if they wanted to keep with the idea that robbs romantic interest had a hand in his betrayal then it would make sense that talisa is a spy too  that just my opinion anyway i think she was just put there as a medic to keep tabs on the northern army i mean whos gonna turn away a hot medic then jackpot robb is interested in her and she gets emotionally conflicted there were reports that oona chaplin was present during the filming during the rw therefore she could go then get smuggled off from orders from lannisters to protect her bc she was their spy im calling it"

"Draco_Dracul",2013-03-06,"one theory ive seen is that in a continuation of the shows tendency to combine multiple characters in to a single character talisa will ultimately play both the role of jeyne westerling breaking robbs engagement to one of freys daughters and jeyne poole in serving as excuse for the boltons to control the north though she wouldnt be playing arya she would instead given them power by being the dowager lady of a house presumed extinct as at that point all the starks would be deadpresumed deaddisqualified from inheriting the fact that its such a tenuous claim is irrelevant as the real power the boltons have is their hostages"

"Kaitscralt",2012-05-10,"im guessing they will split up bran and rickon just to get one child actor out of the series theyve been damn lucky to have so many talented young boys and girls make this series spectacular and they should quit while theyre ahead send him away this is not a jab at rickons actor in particular name eludes me just the risk that comes with child actors in general"

"Queen Regent",2012-05-09,"that was my question for this scene as well if you establish the character has a knife and is willing to kill with it then why wouldnt she have killed theon with it to make sure she wasnt discovered sneaking outif hbo would have killed theon which would have been a major deviation from the books i think this forum would have exploded"
"Stargareyen",2012-05-09,"that scene had so many fallacies that i dont know where to begin understood osha wanted to be out of her chains and prison cell so she made the move on theon but then 1 she could have killed him in his sleep 2 she could have at least procured some kind of keys from him to open brans prison cell 3 one guard for bran rickon halfagiant and 2 fullgrown direwolves seriously summer has shown his skills in ripping out throats before why not repeat the same 4 the crypt scene in the books was such a smart move to misled theon also wouldnt be too hard on the budget since they have shown crypts before as much as i love skinshows i was relieved to not see theon popping out his tool again and doing wild stuff with osha sure the nakedness of osha pulled in the viewers who watch got for its nudity edited by stargareyen 09 may 2012  0445 pm"
"Ser Dermett Corbray",2012-05-09,"when the scene rolled around i remember thinking oh dear we almost made it through an episode without a sex scene that wasnt in the books but i think it worked it seemed more plausible that theon would flat out refuse to arm her whereas in the book he does arm her and in the book when his men start dying and he doesnt put two and two together he comes across as a bit of a dumbass tv theon has been presented as a guy who thinks a bit too much with his cock so it is believable that he would want to bed her especially given how he tried to woo her in season 1 as for why she wouldnt kill theon yeah theres a bit of a plot hole perhaps she only resorted to killing the guard because she needed to clear the path quickly given how rickon bran hodor and the two direwolves were all waiting around the corner"
"Fylimar",2012-05-09,"maybe she believes that with theon gone the fate of the people in winterfell would be even worse"
"I'll pay the iron price",2012-05-09,"osha could have killed theon but why risk someone overhearing or discovering his body before she had time to get the boys out her plan was to get the stark boys out everything else was secondary to that"

"Hear Us Roar",2012-05-13,"so i was watching the episode for about the fourth time cant get enough of this one with a buddy who like me is very much into the books in the book bran and crew hide in the crypts we couldnt really recall how they were able to distract theonironborn to get to the crypt or rather if it was even necessary however in the show we see osha sleep with theon to supposedly make sure hes knocked out when they make their escapenow this is something my friend brought up i didnt really think about it at first but now im curious as to what others think why did osha sleep with theon are we really supposed to believe it was to keep him preoccupied or make sure he was asleep when they made their escape the reason i say that is because osha is still confronted by a guard who she has to kill she does it quietly and without raising alarm why was there a need to sleep with theon if shes capable of that is there any significance of her asking theon to essentially free her which he does and then allowing him to liveor are we too busy trying to find plot holes when all it really was was hbo trying to squeak another sex scene into the show with a notable actressshe would have been put with the rest under heavy guard being theons woman would allow her to roam freely and the guards would not just kill her outright for being outside at night edited by hear us roar 13 may 2012  1256 am"

"Phat Walda",2012-10-06,"i have to say i found the change they made to this scene kind of offensive they took away all of oshas badassery and made her into yet another woman using her sexuality as a weaponcommodity dislike"
"The Bastard of Bolton",2012-05-07,"im positive aidan gillen was cuing in the audience to his detection of arya in this episode arya took a lot of care in not being spotted and i studied gillens face while he was talking to tywin before taking a glance at arya and after he caught a glimpse the was quick calculation and and smug satisfaction in that face the segue at the end was the tip of the hat arya felt it too thats why she got clumsy after handling the character a bit roughly i feel this is a return to form for hbo littlefinger"
"sennahoj",2012-05-07,"i agree he detected her but keeps it to himself i guess he feels so very cunning to have the edge over such an experienced player as tywin who has arya right in front of him without knowing i wonder how littlefinger is going to use that knowledge"

"David Selig",2012-05-07,"i am not sure at all that lf recognised arya they have made lf such an idiot this season that it is to be expected that he didnt"
"ipsuel",2012-05-07,"my take is that he definitely knew who she was rewinding it you can clearly see him take a 2nd look then the oh shape of his mouth a moment of recognition i thought add to that the strong way he says concerning her daughters and i thought for sure he knew arya"
"Oberyn King",2012-05-07,"being the clever guy he is he would recognize arya anywhere"
"WinterWarrior",2012-05-07,"yeah he recognized her i am not sure where the story line is going to go with that thoughlf seems to be everywhere but aryas story has to follow the book story to a certain extent so i cant see him making off with her or anything like that we will have to see where it goes"
"Ferrum Aeternum",2012-05-07,"completely agree this was easily the most satisfied ive been with gillens lf performance this season there was a moment ill have to go back and watch the episode to point it out specifically where he gets this subtle look of satisfaction on his face  like the cat that got the canary which in fact is a good analogy given the situation"
"The Monkey",2012-05-07,"yeah he probably knows wonder how they will turn that my guess is that he plans to take arya but the weasel soup  bolton takeover happens so shes out of his reach then she escapes and he will be as clueless as to his whereabouts as anyone else"

"TheEvilKing",2012-05-07,"i too think he knows i think he kept it a secret for two reasons because tywin was a bit of a condescending dick to him and because powar is knowledge i wonder if hell still be at harrenhal in the next episode"

"Spidey",2012-05-08,"whether or not he recognized her is pretty much irrelevant for now hes traveling to highgarden in order to conduct negotiations on tywins behalf at the time he gets back from that arya will already have fled harrenhal disappearing once again"

"Buckwheat",2012-05-09,"i think he recognised her or at least suspects strongly about who she is my prediction is that she will realise they know who she is either lf or tywin or both like maybe she will hear lf telling tywin about his suspicions and this will lead to her decision to run away quickly before they close her and send her back to kl otherwise they will have troubles explaining her escape  it is not like she has it worse in harrenhal than on the road btw where is hot pie"
"RobertOfTheHouseBaratheon",2012-05-09,"he certainly recognised her i dont know how anyone could have any doubt of that i think it will lead to him asking tywin for harrenhall as a reward including its current staffpeasants as a way of getting his hands on her without irking suspicion asking tywin for his cupbearer might raise his eyebrows arya will have escaped by then and the series can explain why lf discards harrenhall aften receiving it without explaining it was to give him the status for marriage as this is too complicated for tv audiences"

"House Snow",2012-05-09," we really dont know what tywin knows he obvious suspects something or he wouldn keep correcting her lies and implying that she isnt lowborn here is an idealets see how it plays out before making unfounded statements"

"Ser Greguh",2012-05-10,"while the show has been different from the books its been mostly in details that arent really that meaningful arya still wastes her first death on a vile soldier as a test and uses her second out of an immediate need in the book she felt she had to get out from under weeses watchful eye before she could do anything useful the show crystalized that need a bit more urgently and killed off a minor character only a bit before his death in the books at the hand of a character that has so far been cut im fairly confident theyll keep the third death largely the same except that it will be bolton that gets captured economy of characters and boltons takeover of the castle wont be aided by a lannister turncloak since we have no vargo hoat amory lorch is dead and its a little late in the season to introduce a new major lannister henchman out of the blue that makes aryas effort a meaningful thing not the empty gesture that it was in the books where the entire capture was a ruse and arya just gummed up the plan a little which i actually think will be an improvement tywin will have just left for kl with littlefinger im guessing theyll skip over the whole battle of the fords drama since without an edmure theres no real point to that but that gives them the endpoint of showing up in kl at the last moments of the battle and saving the day with tyrell troops from the alliance that lf forged which is still right there with the books that also still puts arya in a position to be boltons cupbearer but have her realize that bolton is every bit as bad as tywin was if not worse and decide to escape hopefully still with gendry and hot pie rather than risk revealing herself which will be intercut nicely with ramsays sacking of winterfell and the revelation that the boltons are up to no good allowing the viewer to realize that arya did the right thing dd arent changing things just to change them theres been a lot of necessary compression but from my pov it seems to have been dons specifically so that they can still get to the end point of the books as far as lfs glance i dont think he recognized arya other than perhaps getting a slight tinge of recognition but not being able to place it its possible theyre setting up a eureka moment for him later but it will be after its too late for anything to come of it and thus wont actually effect anything"

"Ser Greguh",2012-05-11,"possibly but how do you imagine tywin would deal with cersei jamie or much less tyrion lieing to his face several times cersei says that tywin never smiles at his funeral but he seems to be pretty friendly and willing to discuss his past including the potential family weakness of jamies dyslexia he had tyrions wife gang raped and forced him to particpate he forced jamie to lie and say tysha was a whore he paid he gave up on jamie when he was in captivity at riverrun which is why he sent tyrion to be the hand in the first place because he was the last son he had and finally disowned jamie when he insisted on retaining his position as head of the kingsguardtywin had the deserters at the battle of blackwaters knees broken with hammers to serve as a visual warning to any further desertion and had his men rape murder and burn the villages of the riverlands to provoke the starks to attack him at harrenhal tywin did not suffer disloyalty in his vassals and was not a very sympathetic person but apparently in his cupbearers his patience is much higherhe did all of those things and yet is still a complex driven human and not a complete monster like gregor or ramsay hes only brutal when he finds it necessary and its absurd to think hed find it necessary to discipline a foraged cupbearer over a minor understandable and ultamitely inconsequential lie particularly when that cupbearer is in her own way showing more competence than some of his battlefield commanders the book gives us backstory and internal monologue while the series invents a scene with arya but both are to the same effect if you choose to believe that tywin is a complete monster and that the show ruins this for you thats your prerogative but there are plenty of people that are very knowledgeable of the books that would strongly disagree with youat any rate it still comes back to the fact that the only similarities are that arya and tywin are at harrenhal and jaqen has offered her 3 deaths and gendry is serving as a blacksmith so i still stand by the statement that there are more changes than similarities in the story line and so trying to predict what will happen next based on the books is not particulary likely to give you a good predictionthis is quite simply not true the similarities are plentiful but you have to dig a level deeper than the superficialities youre looking at like i said the first of aryas names is wasted on an inconsequential but despicable soldier driven in part or in whole by the fact that arya didnt really trust jaqen and thought it might be a trap it doesnt matter that the name was the tickler instead of chiswyck other than the fact that it deprives arya of a moment in book 3 but really that moment was lost  altered really  when the show didnt have the time to focus quite so much on the torturethe second death was done out of an immediate personal need in both the show and the book the name and context were different and the show certainly amped up the immediate tension  again a consequence of booktoscreen adaptation but thematically they were identicalso its perfectly reasonable to presume that the third death will follow the theme of the books which was arya making a choice that she felt would best help her brothers war effort and realizing that she could manipulate jaqen into going above and beyond the strict threedeath limit by naming jaqen himself the fact that she was willing to snatch a message from tywins table to further the stark war effort foreshadows that thats already on her mind and frankly its such an awesome arya moment that dd would be loathe to lose it though theyve changed the details they have built toward itthat its going to be different in the details is a foregone conclusion we might as well complain that its telling the story using pictures and sounds instead of just words but just because it shifts details here and there doesnt mean that theyre changing things just because and doesnt mean theyre not building to the big moments that are straight from the books its not impossible to predict you just need to use different tools"

"Caro99",2012-05-01,"i think we got a glimpse of dany running through the house of the undying so cool that they will stick to it though it will be intresting to see which prophecies are mentioned  which ignored also i really saw a contrast from the book cersei to the one fro the show when she asks tyrion how he thinks it would feel like to have someone he loves taken from him or something like that in the book cersei is flirting with lancel while myrcella is depating but here cesei does come through as a much more symphatetic character which i neither like or dislike i just think lenas preformance is great and really lookig forward to ygritte but what i cant wait for anymore are the riot scenes i fear it but ill cling to the hope that hbo will stick to the books here and show us sandor saving sansa they said their relationship would be indeed explore but so far nothing so i dont mind if the moment is diffrent from the one in the books since they have no horses and the hound seems to be protecting joff in a lot of stills but so long as he leaves joff who is once again going to get slapped by tyrion ill be happy but hopefully it wont be another 3 seconds moment like the whole previous sansa being beaten thing with barely any sansan to enjoy"
"Davos55",2012-05-01,"i am really looking forward to this episode jons storyline is finally picking up and the scenes with ygritte and the other wildlings looks great the riot will be amazing roose bolton in general is awesome i am very curious to see what is going on with dany next episodeit looks pretty interesting i remember that after the 5th episode last season the episodes really picked up paceso this should hold true this year as well cant wait for sunday edit i hope we see some jamie this episode also sandor better have some epic moments in the riot from a different preview it looked like the fat septon is in the scenehe is going to get annihilated definitely one of the more intense scenes in the book edited by davos55 01 may 2012  1141 am"
"Arkash",2012-05-01,"alright after rewatching the preview of the episode and doing some stills here are some random thoughts i guess we see jon faking to kill ygritte towards the end of it i like it otherwise the rest is really obvious we have a shot of stonesnake shooting an arrow guess it is him was it him or dalbridge the archer in the book  in qarth there seems to be some actions totally new from the books guardsmen lying dead in their blood xaro finding them khovaro running somewhere and dany too all of this seems to take place in the garden of a villa doesnt seem like xaros gardens but who knows maybe an attack from the sorrowful men but that seems weird glad we are to see the spice king again robb saying something i cant fully understand  i mean to take it there myself well not sure if this is that but seems he learned the news from winterfell my guess is that at first he wants to go back there himself but probably roose and cat reason him and hell send someone else roose guess the episode will mainly focus on jon daenerys and robb plus the riot and winterfell i think arya davos stannis and mel wont really appear next episode"
"MikeNH",2012-05-01,"as far as roose being the one who takes winterfell  that can still happen wout any changes to robbs storyline remember when ramsay takes it he pins the blame on theon so roose could very well march up there under the guise of saving winterfell kill off the troops from torrhens square capture theon and then kill everyone  sack winterfell and then go back to robb saying they got there too late but they did manage to extract revenge on the iron islanders which really is how it plays out in the books anyway minus ramsay so roose could sack winterfell and then head back down to the twins for the wedding still under the pretense of being loyal to robb"
"Hot Pie Targaryen",2012-05-01,"im a little hazy on the timeline but i would assume that arya may meet roose bolton in the next episode news reaches harrenhal that winterfell has been occupied and tywin moves to take advantage of this allowing roose to take over with a contingent of northern men or not just spitballing ideas robb being betrayed may refer to the karstarks it most definitely does not refer to roose boltonand im willing to bet that well see ramsey next season for the simple fact that theon needs to stay involved with both the storyline and the production it provides ample material for winterfell and theon next seasononce again it seems obvious that the betrayer being referred to is theon its been stated on the show iirc that robb and theon think of each other as brothers edited by hot pie targaryen 01 may 2012  1218 pm"

"Versiroth",2012-05-03,"while all of us would like to see characters like ramsey the reeds etc in the tv series adding too many characters for nonreaders to try to follow would likely lead to disaster making osha take the part of the reeds and roose take the part of ramsey just makes more sense otherwise a nonreader could miss one episode and then be completely lost as more and more characters are constantly introduced heck some are probably lost right now due to them having to skip around so much in an attempt to try to get everyone in they barely have time to give the current characters proper screen time much less add in additional fluff characters it does suck but i do believe that its necessary season 3 is supposed to be just the first half of book 3 id imagine it likely ends with the red wedding so they should be able to give everyone proper screen time without having everything feel rushed and mashed together edited by versiroth 03 may 2012  0839 am"

"TormundGiantsbane",2012-05-07,"with bran and rickon on the lam only accompanied by hodor and osha and no jojen or meera who is going to accompany who once bran and rickons roads split hodor is of course going with bran but hodor not being much of a talker how is bran going to share his thoughts as he journeys north osha seems more connected to bran and i am guessing she will play that part but then who will take care of little rickon disclaimer i love the deviations little things like this allow even us book readers to be surprised and speculate"
"KC_Accidental",2012-05-12,"i think jojen and meera will be introduced next season meeting bran and co on the road under the pretence of their father sending them to help once he heard what happened to winterfell howland or jojen will have had green dreams telling them bran and rickon are still alive so i think it will work out the same as the books if not then another possibility is that maester luwin survives and goes with rickon maybe to die later when davos comes along i agree though i cant see it being just hodor and bran"
"Strider",2012-05-13,"jojen and meera seem superfluous given the development of oshas character she knows the north she knows the stories she can well serve as guide to bran introducing two new characters seems unnecessary i agree that luwin would be a good choice as rickons companion rickon will be in good hands theres no need to kill off luwin just to conform to the book we wont see his character again for years"

"Ramsay Gimp",2012-05-09,"dagmer seems loyal to theon he was the only one of the crew to show him any respect or attempt to bond with him in episode 5 his advice to execute rodrick makes sense from an ironborn pov it wasnt a politically wrong decision just because it makes the audience sad if we accept the premise that theon is trying to hold winterfell some dramatic act is needed to establish his authority the crowd and rodrick were openly mocking himwe already know that ramsay is going to show up i dont think theon will be betrayed at all except by yara refusing to send reinforcements ramsay will just attack and sack the castle the oldfashioned way the twist at this point will be that ramsay is not prostark and proceeds to burn the castle down"
"Jamie Lannister",2012-05-09,"i think dagmers loyalty towards prince theon is genuine enough maybe he does genuinely want balons last boy to fit in with the other ironborn and thus encourages this whole iron price ideal im more inclined to think ramsay will kill him a little later theyre enemies theyve never met and they have no common interests that i can see at this point"

"Brienne the Beauty",2012-05-10,"i think you are all scrambling to try and cram a divergent plot back into the way the books go my personal theory is that dagmer is yaras man shes sent him along to ensure that theon screws up and does not gain the respect of his father which would disinherit her dagmer has the same name as dagmer cleftjaw but is clearly a different character he seems sly and mocking of theon not respectful and loyal he seems like an obvious backstabber to me"

"Envie",2012-05-10,"this whole thread of strange theories about dagmer being ramsay is really silly come on you guys youre reaching just a tad bit too far here dont you think why do you really think they would need to twist the plot that much for a story that doesnt need it introducing ramsay later is fine and can still give full impact of the betrayals to come theres no need to morph dagmer into anything more than he is if anything theyve played up a character who was already pretty strikingly imposing in the books on his own merits theyre doing this to show the internal struggle theon is having about betraying the starks and nothing more in my opinion in the book we get a lot more detail about the ironborn and theons thoughts and conflicts this is harder to show on television with just short scenes in episodes and so for many of the story lines they have added or embellished some of the characters to aid in the storytelling if theon had come up with this plan on his own it may not have seemed as believable as having dagmer acting as the devil on his shoulder encouraging it as well as paying the iron price with rodriks death its obvious to tv fans and book fans alike that theon for all his desire to be ironborn just isnt measuring up he wants rodrik imprisoned which is a much softer kinder order from a lord who has grown up among the more honorable starks than the brutal greyjoys its painfully obvious by now to most viewers that theons weaker character is never going to be what the ironborn expect of him and part of that realization comes through dagmers menacing presence egging him on to do these villainous acts its completely reasonable to assume at this point dagmer will be the mastermind bethind the miller boys death  switch out and makes sense with as much screen time and antagonism theyve given him thus far it does not mean hes ramsay in disguise thats not only an unbelievable plot change it would be confusing and nonsensical to both book and television fans"

"Winterfell is Burning",2012-05-07,"i think he plays tywin exactly how i pictured him a confident stern ruler someone who isnt afraid to make the tough choice or rub someone the wrong wayi actually think he may know he has arya but doesnt want to let it on to arya he makes her feel comfortable and she is less apt to run away she thinks she has him played but i think he is a bit smarter than that especially in the scene where she is talking to him about her stonemason father he just had a look of he knew a little bit more than she thought he diddoes tywin even know that arya escapedanyway even if he does i think he would have dismiss ned starks daughter becoming his cupbearer as too much of a coincidence"
"House Balstroko",2012-05-07,"i like tywins portrayal in the show it does give him gretaer depth than what we got in the books and somehow makes him a bit more of a sympathetic character"
"The Smiling Eye",2012-05-07,"one of the best actors in the show imo i love his scenes so much i actually really like the show tywin and i feel like he could be a good man if i didnt know any better his scenes with arya are a bit heartwarming almost"
"boojam",2012-05-07,"so what do you think of tv tywin charles dance is perfect but this episode he started to seem really out of character chitchatting with his cupbearer telling her stories smiling at her etc imo he is just way nicer than book tywin plus arya has completely given herself away as a highborn with her being able to read and her speech not to mention tywin has smiled and raised his voice quite a bit in the show i know its a showbut book tywin is infamous for never smiling or raising his voice or showing much emotion at all its talked about all of the time in scenes that hes in are you liking this tv change or noyou know i think george does mention in the books that tywin does smile  rarely but can happenanyway dance and i think dd have mentioned that they are tweaking the tywin character for the seriesi dont mind  thought he was a wee bit one dimensional in the novels"
"Darth Pipes",2012-05-07,"dance is fantastic and i love his portrayel of tywin on the show although i cant help but think of tywin doing a reading is fundamental commercial after yesterday winkpng classbbcemoticon alt  as i recall in the books tywin was said to have smiled during his wedding and when tarbeck hall crumbled"
"Patchface12",2012-05-07,"yeah the only smile i remember dance doing was the one where arya tells him anyone can be killed and that smile was damn creepy"
"AegonTheUnlikely",2012-05-07,"im walking a middle line between tywin knowing he has arya and him being completely oblivious recall that there is some speculation that roose bolton may or may not have known who arya was in his time at harrenhal his later conversation with theon about betraying ones birth by speech is illustrative my theory is tywin being the observant man that he is recognized arya nearly from the get go as possibly high born he almost certainly doesnt suspect her of being arya stark but he might suspect that she is the daughter of some minor lord or landed knight her speech and mannerisms shout her heritage to anyone capable of looking tywin probably figures that once everything settles down shell be worth something to someone best to keep her around i think that dance nails tywin all the way through there was one point in the war council scene where he had what i might describe as the makings of a toothy grin but it looked to me like the kind of smile a cat has while its toying with a mouse i wouldnt want to be the recipient of that look"
"FiveByeSeven",2012-05-07,"hey guys so it turns out in the tv series young jamie had dyslexia as a kid my grandmother once confined me to my room an hour a day rewriting sentences when my elementary teachers reported i had squiggly penmanship i can only shudder at how tywin must have spent his four hours a day making sure jamie learned his letters edited by fivebyeseven 07 may 2012  1059 pm"
"Honey Badger",2012-05-07,"i think the tv tywin is very different from the books but im willing to enjoy a different take on him given dances great performance they are succeeding at humanizing him but when you rack up the rains of castamere his wedding gift to his son tyrion his actions with the mountain and bolton how robb gets his at the red wedding  well theres a reason people think him a villain and its not for being practical"
"Ponyo Payne",2012-05-08,"he reminds me of the penguin from the old batman tv show for 2 reasons first there is something in the way both actors will keep there heads still and shift their eyes while looking at people and you can tell the wheels are turning quickly second the penguins henchmen were a bunch of bumbling idiots the last few episodes it has been the same for tywin null"
"Paurush",2012-05-08,"it is hard to understand why people go on calling tywin a villan  he is too ignorant and proud to be one i really dont think he knows what we all know that his grand son is born by incest between his own son and daughter to him he is fighting for his grandsons rightful claim to the iron throne and all those who oppose him are simply power hungry snakes so for tywin he is riding on the same righteous boat that stannis is riding for all the wrong reasons  he simply thinks his actions no matter how cruel  are means to righteous cause  so i believe even the book tywin is same as the tv one just that instead of a camera in the book we see him through highly biased povs of other people mostly tyrion  who dont get along with him at all  the tv series is doing much more justice to tywin as a character then readers have done in the book  edited by paurush 08 may 2012  0210 am"
"The Monkey",2012-05-08,"yeah the show has reached its limit of onedimensional villains in joffrey im glad they changed him"
"Bambi",2012-05-08,"i dont feel like tywin would be out of character i just feel we see those sides of his personality which werent explained in the book but were hinted in some way although we havent seen tywin in the books doing things like we see in the movie i always pictured him a character like this the first moment i actually disliked him in the book was before his death when tyrion revealed him with shae"
"Fylimar",2012-05-08,"imho he is very similar to book tywin  there were a lot of hints from memories of his family that he had emotions and sometimes showed them but as people already mentioned most of the memories are through his children and they all have a grudge by then for him in some form tyrion and jamie dont need explaining cersei felt left alone by her father  first because he wanted to marry her again and then he died and left her there with a mess  so their pov werent that kindly to him and i think that he didnt know about jamies and cerseis incest and jamie trying to kill bran so he felt that he has all the rights of westeros to act as he did in the books maybe it ocurred to him later therefore his wish to marry cersei off far away from kl but i dont remember if that is ever mentioned somewhere in the book well dance did a great performance as ever ans maisie too  she is quite talented someone mentioned that he wanted a tywin and arya show  i would love that "
"Rockroi",2012-05-08,"the complexity of the story beguiles simplicity in titles and labels ie villain certainly tywins aims and goals are opposite those of the family the reader is forced to identify as the hero the starks but tywins overall goals are not evil in the sense that they are destructive for destruction sake he is not simply out there to kill maim and torture for the sake of the actions alone he is ruthless he is violent and he is extremely proud hes also smart fair dutiful and that duty would be preserving the honor and power of his house i find tywin to be an incredibly complex man and an extremely effective leader in extremely violent and ruthless times households are not allowed to defy their liege lord hence castermere and the tarbecks if you fight a war you fight to win and then help your enemies back to their feet a part of the sentence people always neglect to remember bad people work for him and ned and robb had roose bolton its a dangerous world out there and when your son marries a commoner you have to teach him a lesson period that is not how you do things tywins response was barbaric and its not something anyone in this day or age could condone and i wont either but back then im only saying that tywin lannister is not a villain for one or two bad acts"

"Tadco26",2012-05-08,"tywin specifically sent the mountain ser amory and the bloody mummers out to rape and pillage they put whole villages to the torch raped the women and mutilated them and butchered the children and left them unburied so that the corpses would attract wolves and wild dogs all in an effort to provoke the starktully forces to attack him at harrenhal as the blackfish noted catelyn says when edmure hears this he will rage blackfish and that will be just as lord tywin desires even terror has its purpose cat lannister wants to provoke us to battle robb is like to give him that wish catelyn said fretful he is a restless cas a cat sitting here and edmure and the greatjon and the others will urge him on  brynden blackfish arched a bushy grey eyebrow more fool they my first rule of war cat never give an enemy his wish lord tywin would like to fight on a field of his choosing he wants us to march on harrenhal one might argue that is a sound tactical move if you are completely heartless to all the victims that will die in the process in but he certainly knew what he was doing when he gave the orders"
"WhiteWalder",2012-05-08,"dance just looks and sounds like tywin when i imagined him not to mention his acting job"

"Knight Of Winter",2012-05-08,"but how can tywin not be viewed as a villain he directly oposses every trait and characteristic that make human beings actually human he has no moral compass at all and puts all his energy towards one goal  maikng house lannister more powerful for this goal tywin is willing to do literally everything  let people be killed let people be tortured let more people be killed let women be raped and even sacrifice happiness of other members some of them are his own children of house hes trying to leadevery action tywin takes is about achieving his only goal most efficiently for example1 he wants to scare riverlords and reduce their wealth  he sends gregor to pillage torture and kill their peasants not the decision any decent man would make  but most efficient2 he wants to diminish the value of captive starks have captured  he gives up on jaime as his son again  the most efficient course of action3 he wants to teach his son a lesson  so he has his wife gangraped by his garrison well it made tyrion hate him for the rest of his life  but he sure learned his lesson4 he wants people to fear him  thus he is willing to keep people such as gregor clegane and amory lorch at his side5 among many other examples such as rw him ordering killings of rhaegars childrenfor further explanations and elaborations about tywins character let me just say that i wholeheartedly agree with post quoted below original thread is here httpasoiafwesteraninwesterosi ranted a bit about tywin lannister in the morality thread and to my surprise no one took me up on it perhaps some even thought i was kidding oh no ladies and gentlemen absoloutely nottywin lannister has a special mix in both his public actions as a politician and a military commander and crucially in his private life as lord and father of utter callousness for human life a flagrant disregard for justice duty loyalty or honor completel lack of any personal code a twisted oft indulged cruelty and no redeeming tragic background to excuse any of it it is this combination i contend that pushes him to the very top  worse than gregor theon bolton or frey  of the huge of heap of terrible people in westerosi often see tywin characterized as efficient cold measured rational unemotional controlled pragmatic whne discussing shae turning up in his bed its generally viewed as blatant reversal of characterization it even has a vast conspiracy theory to explain it in this thead he was a clear majority to be the handare you people reading the same books im readingtywin is a rabid petty lunatic just waiting to go off id rather have the bastard love child of joffrey and viserys as my hand shae  a cheap trashy whore who was his sons  is surprising but completely in character the man to quote stephen fry has the attitude to sex of the catholic church  like the anorexic or the morbidly obese to foodhe keeps constantly on hand people like gregor and vargo hoat is completely uncritical of their actions and is always willing to use them his tactics in war are incredibly dirty and underhanded he will rape and pillage and torture as a tactic flying false banners pay off his enemies allies send assasins he is a liar a cheat and a traitor again and again he will not blink to murder childrenas for being handhe gave the kingdom peace the kind of peace that exploded into a rebellion that swept up half the realm at the drop of couple of roses he was flagrantly disloyal at the end of course but before that  he was utterly unreliable we saw how much he cared about the kingdom how willing he was to leave it in aerys mad hands the moment it no longer served his pride and the aggrandizment of his family  not to mention broke his tyrannical iron grip over his son  he was outta thereand then theres tywin  the father jaime and cercei  good god just look at that duo one of the only few good things we ever hear about tywin was that he smiled for cercei good job parenting there considering she was murdering her friends as a preteen jaime waited a few years at least to start tossing children from heightsand now tysha she was raped by an entire garrison to teach his son a lesson this isnt measured rational unemotional its bizzare cartoonish over the top a piece of pure gleeful theater of torture and cruelty topped off with the lies the money forcing tyrion to go last this is what he did to his son for daring to fall in love with someone he found inappropriate thats not how anyone with a shred of maturity or a concience would deal with the situationhe never smiles for fucks sake can you get more petulantly melodramtically arrogantly emo than thaton a side note i do agree showtywin does not differ much from his book counterpart and that charles dance is doing magnificent job of portraying him"
"Mad Queen",2012-05-08,"i just dont like tywin getting chatty with his cupbearer thats something i dont think any of the lords would do least of all tywin who is so proud it feels wrong to me remember that roose bolton completely ignored arya and when she asked him a question he was surprised and then threatened to have her tongue cut out"
"Blisscraft",2012-05-08,"i agree that tv tywin is more human than the books however dance is wonderful i think her captures the spirit of tywin perfectly"
"Queen Regent",2012-05-08,"i think charles dance is portraying tywin perfectly sometimes i think he knows that she is arya but then other times i dont think he really does itll be interesting to see how it plays out i think little finger was eyeing her pretty hard he knew he knew her from somewhere but maybe couldnt remember from where"
"Rob Snow",2012-05-08,"i agree that tv tywin is more human than the books however dance is wonderful i think her captures the spirit of tywin perfectlydance definitely humanizes tywin but i think most of that job was done by having him at harrenhall and onscreen much more than he was in acok tywins ample screen time really allows the viewer to contrast him with tyrion who is operating in a similar capacity to his dad in kings landing it also brought meto the conclusionthat they more alike than they are diffrent they both do not suffer fools the both have a soft spots for the stark daughters and they both at least at this point place family above all else of course the similarities kinda end there as tywin has a sociopath streak in him that tyrion cant hope to match"
"bibappu",2012-05-08,"in every scene concerning tywin and arya they show how ruthless and almost cruel he is with his men and even family members as opposed to how fond he is of arya i was a little disappointed when i saw tywin going all cool grandpa with her but i certainly find believable that he finds her at least intriguing"
"Prince of Dragonstone",2012-05-08,"tywin taking a liking to arya can be explained in the context that the character of tywin is intrigued by competence and especially by intelligence we learn that he is surrounded by fools which greatly explains why he kept losing battles to a young boy so for him to encounter someone that is naturally sharp witted and merely a cupbearer well how could he not be a little intrigued"
"Jamie Lannister",2012-05-08,"eh i like it in that its an excuse to see more of dances rather inspired tywin i suppose roose can take harrenhal over after tywin rushes off to the blackwater and explain as much to jaime and brienne in s3"

"The Monkey",2012-05-09,"tywin is hard and ruthless and does treat the peasants and tyrion like shit but i dont think his softness in this episode is a character flaw its not unthinkable that he after a long hard day would sit down a contemplate his childhood in front of the fire hearth i didnt perceive it like he was really telling arya about his memories of his father but rather than he was talking to himself and in a way justifying his own harshness by comparing to his father weakness which almost lead to the fall of house lannister"

"StannisandDaeny",2012-05-11,"as someone else said charles dance shows up for 2 minutes and just owns the entire episode and i couldnt agree more i liked his parts immensely as for appearing more human even tywin is after all only human why do you think he hides behind such a stern face no one is naturally like that i think i understand him a little because ive written a character that had something in common with him at one time the sense of duty towards an institution in this case his house and the psychology of the goal justifies the means because he was so convicted because of his anger of his house being a disgrace and a laughing stock and realizing youve reached the point you cant turn back on that or reverse time and thus just carry on to at least be successful even if it does come at a huge cost even though you know its wrong realizing his children are screwing everything up tywin likely knows the possibility is large the rumours about jaime and cersei are true hes no fool and that his house would likely simply crumble again once hes gone despite all his sacrifices would wear a man down eventually and have him at least need to vent these thoughts now and then hes not really nice in the show though i dont think most people whove only seen the show will see him as a nice person and have a lot of sympathy for him we just think hes a lot nicer now because in the books hes much worse"

"summer_stark",2012-05-12,"i do like tv tywin  a lot  but my first thought when he made arya cupbearer was  he will be good to her which will explain to the viewer why she doesnt pick him which is exactly whats happening he is cruel to his men and not super nice to arya all the time  but he is nice enough to her that she has it easy with him as her boss also re the people wondering whether tywin andor lf know  at first i totally disagreed with this but i can totally see dd making it so that lftywin know who she is and arya finds out and that sparks her escape that wouldnt explain the third death though  and i will be bummed if we dont get weasel soup i just hope tywin leaves soon  otherwise we definitely wont get it and she will probably escape him  though to have people actively looking for her would be a pretty big deviation i mean outside the people who chase after her when she leaves and then nymeria eats all of themthey didnt know she was arya just someone who escaped and killed a guard then again it seems like he has to leave in order for her to have a 3rd death that is meaningful even if it isnt weasel soup  not that that was particularly meaningful truth be told  but it was awesome  because if he is still there and is still being kind to her then obviously the north wont be taking harrenhall  and if he is still there but turns on her then shed name him before she escaped so i dont know how they will have this play out i just keep hoping he leaves soon like episode 7 even though i love their dynamic i want weasel soup in some way shape or form"
"Zod",2012-05-12,"well tv shows need to make characters likable just like george r r martin said they will probably deviate much from the books with tywins character in the episodes ahead i honestly believe that this change for tywin is for the better as it offers us new insight on the other side of tywin which makes him a far more believable figure"
"Fylimar",2012-05-12,"apart from the obvious psychopath the mountain ramsay and a few others martin described most characters in different shades of grey  tywin is no exception to that  and i think dance brings only the side of tywin to life tyrion never gets to see  without loosing his cold and ruthless behavior tbh  i thought he would finish lorch himself when he started accusing him in that episode i think he is nice to arya because he suspects that she isnt just a stonemasons daugther i dont think he knows who she is but that she could be a valuable hostage  so keeping her close and making her feel secure is a smart move imho"
"RSasoiaf",2012-05-12,"thats not it in the books he wanted the peace with the starks and to let ned take the black stark and baratheon out of kings landing with lannister control was just fine with him it was joffreys stupidity with the beheading that set everything off joffrey was bad enough so that tywin thought it was time for a lesson and tyrion despite himself actually felt bad for jofftywin isnt a evil dictator looking to slaughter for fun even the business with the mountain raping and pillaging was just to draw ned out so he could be captured but jaime with his bravado confronted ned and injured him which is where beric came in to take his place tywin unfortunately doesnt have family members that does what he wantsnope you are the one who want to believe on something that is not in the booksyou will have to quote where does tywin says he would like to have stark going to the wall where actually he never says that on the series also even on season one he asks his son why is he still aliveso both book and series clearly state that tywin does not care that much about stark at the start tywin only starts thinking on other options after he gets in a really bad place in bettween what could be the south and the north marching for kings landing still as soon as the southern border is once again safe tywin gets back to his original idea and itâs bye bye to all the starks he may get his hands onalso you have to remember that it was actually tywin who did start the war it was not cat it was not even jaime it was tywin and i tell you why cat did something wrong but she was still not starting a full out war catâs issue could have been solved bettween tywin nedd and robert should they be willing to robert was quite willing and nedd only jumps the gun after he gets news about the mountain going all friendly on the riverlands jaime also did not start a full out war jaime did a move against nedd but he run away when it did not work quite that well jaime was not really trying to start a war actually jaime only got involved on the war once his father ordered him to go and beat the crap out of riverrunthe only 2 leaders who actually called for a war were tywin and robband tywin actually did it first by declaring full out war against the riverlands without any reason for it by the wayactually had robb not called for his banners it is most likely that tywin would sweep through the riverlands and then try and march on the northhe was actually marching that way when he found out that robb was heading south it is telling enough that tywin was not even marching on the vale to get tyrion backnop it was more or less obvious that he knew well enough that lysa would stay neutral and therefore he wanted to get the riverlands and the north as fast as possiblethus he split his forces bettween him and jaimenow if this is someone who wants for peacehe never actually did nothing to get it and you will have to point me to anything that tywin actually did in order to get peace with someone did he actually do anything keep in mind that even when robb was no longer a threat and had to pretty much fall back even then tywin was not asking for peace we know well enough what tywin did and most likely will do in the series also he will wipe out the starksnow if thatâs someone peacefull"

"Fez",2012-05-07,"all i demand from a work of fiction is that be internally consistent once that tricks down we can move on to things like dialog but it comes first this is game of thrones not a song of ice and fire and everything from that perspective was completely in line with what has come previouslyand qarth was always a weak point in the story i think dany going to the warlocks on a quest for revenge for 3 counts of dragon kidnapping adds a lot of muchneeded drama to it"

"Peasant Rebel Leader",2012-05-07,"the episode worked for me they do less exposition now and more story there are actual miniarcs in one episode see osha convincing theon and then freeing the kids fe there were some unnecessary weak points like the sitcomy way robbs scenes with jeynetalisa were set up jaqen literally able and willing to kil armory lorch in under 5 minutes or the fact that they have apparently already eaten all their horses in kings landing must have been the big bad budget monster especially the way robb and talisas epic love story  copyright hollywood  was presented irked me it seemed more of twu luuv than the pseudorealism were used to from game of thrones so what bothered you more actually the adaption from the books or the inner consistency of the tv series itself"

"SerArthurHeath",2012-05-07,"nope i think the abruptness of the opening scene was a positive and a lesson in how such a scene should be done too many films and shows overuse foretelling dramatic irony only works if it is used sparingly and as the out of the blue events are a grrm specialty i think the first scene was both in character with the books and great jaqen can kill people in whatever way he likes hes a fm i thought it was too ordinary a killing if anything every change in this epsiode imo was a triumph if i wanted to go over the story of the books rather than someone elses portrayal that captures the spirit and characters and so far though i have my worries important aspects of plot if just reread the books a straight adaptation like a straight cover frequently adds nothing to a piece of art and letting adaptors be they covering musicians actors or directors put their own interpretation onto their adaptation is the entire point behind it"
"SerArthurHeath",2012-05-07,"replacing jeyne westerling kind of a big change imo but as long as robb ends up reluctantly breaking his oath to the freys to marry another girl out of love than its not a big deal in the show though seems like hes the one trying to bang her and shes not a noble so it seems a bit out of characteri still think it is jeyne or someone like her if i could find a bookie offering odds on her bring a noble id put a huge bet on it she even admits it in this episode every single bit of her characterisation shouts noble and more than a bit shouts princess jasmine from disneys aladdin id put a smaller bet on her being a westerosi noble too or at least being a lannister bastard"
"Morrigan",2012-05-07,"yes i enjoyed the opening of the episode and the riot minus the romero zombie flick silliness but theres only so many changes you can make just for the sake of having changes before it moves from being an adaptation and straight into hackneyed fanfiction territory this episode crossed the line for me now if only the changed scenes were wellwritten i might be more tolerant but they were shoddily executed and broke internal consistency multiple time this is the biggest issue for me"
"SerArthurHeath",2012-05-07,"what do you think broke internal consistency there may well have been stuff but i didnt notice anything"

"Prince of Dragonstone",2012-05-07,"the opening scene was one of the best scenes in the series thus far i am not a purist if i wanted the book id read the book i totally expect and want the show to diverge a little bit often when they do diverge its for the best the added scenes have been wonderful additions roz has been the only dud in that regard anyway everyones acting during the sack of winterfell scene was what really made it alfie allen deserves at least a nomination for this my heart was in my throat the whole time even though i knew what would happen"

"cromagnificent",2012-05-07,"taking off ser rodricks head was brilliant imo it had much more dramatic effect than killing mikken or the kennel master who we have no connection to the look on alfie allens face was masterful actingit was the perfect portrayal of a man who knows he just went too far to ever turn back i had to pause the show and just stare for 10 minutes to let it sink in maybe my favorite episode thus far as far as the reeds go dont get all sweaty and worked up i saw at least 2 dozen posts of people freaking out bcuz ramsey wasnt cast yet either but it looks like hes good to go so i bet the reeds are in the mix too"
"johnnysd",2012-05-07,"actually not at all i truly believe that the tv show is providing a tighter more interesting show than the books with beautiful symmetry with previous seasons and better character arcs season is hitting every major point in the books but is getting there in a streamlined and improved fashion in many ways i think many characters are deeper more grey and much more interesting than their more onedimensional book counterparts i agree with almost every decision they have made this year except for yara and even some changes that seem limiting like the deaths of almost all of danys khalasar will pay dividends down the road in her arc the books are special things they are so complex and deep and detailed and the events are not tidy with seemingly dozens of minor characters and extra characters that okay pivotal roles at certain parts of the books it reads almost like history and the fact that the scope and breadth of the sheer number of players contribute to the story in some way gives it incredible realism grrm is consistent in this and only in a few instances goes the obvious and formulaic way of using his characters the tv show condenses many characters so that the main characters have richer and denser arcs in the show and it makes the experience much better its not like they cut down that much either there are still probably 1520 fairly major characters at this point in the books though there is probably 50 but the main story is actually untouched and the key moments all happen it is still amazingly faithful to the books some of the changes like danys dragons being stolen seem like elements that grrm should have included himself i think that the show and the books are separate but equal and both neat the pinnacle of excellence for their medium"

"Patchface12",2012-05-07,"the only thing i thought was kind of stupid was amory lorchs death i felt this great feeling of satisfaction when he got fed to the bear his death was just so forgettable and unrealistic in the show robb said he could tell talissa was highborn which leads me to believe she is jeyne under some guise tho why he would marry someone who deliberately lied to him i dont know im hoping jon eventually does let ygritte go and find the halfhand and co and all those events are nothing more than filler one change i did sort of like was jaime having dyslexia"
"Frumpus",2012-05-07,"they kept the spirit of the original story and the only real change was the ending cliffhanger which im sure will be resolved rather quickly in next weeks episode i really dont get why people are complaining it is impossible to follow the book word by word they have to condense stuff its common sense"
"congokong",2012-05-07,"that wasnt the acting it was the script great way to show confusion in my opinionno it was the acting he didnt seem surprised and his tone was uninterested"
"MrDoog",2012-05-07,"nope im not too bothered was very curious as to how they were planning on spicing up daenerys arc stealing dragons is as good as any i suppose the first scene at winterfell was done excellently imo the robb love interest thing is slightly peculiar i dont have a problem with it i just think its all rather pointless to change it from how the books portrayal my best guess is that theyre doing this in order to give robb more screen time rather than having long periods where hes absent i think thats a big positive overall and in having him as a mainish character it will serve to increase his tragedy in the next season in that the audience will be emotionally invested in bride and groom good call by the show writers i think having arya serve as tywins cupbearer grand for the purposes of a tv show a major player like tywin does need to be shown more and be kept fresh in the viewers mind jon  ygritte too early to judge or say how theyre going to polish that off but theyve dedicated too much air time to halfhand to not feature him in the next episode or two the important thing is that none of these adaptation changes are detracting from the key points of the book or the characterisation of our main players and all the while the show is made more accessible to those that havent read the books im loving the series i loved the books theyre slightly different so what the only thing in the whole series that has really annoyed me was in season one when tyrion gets knocked unconscious before his battle and as a result half of me cant wait for the battle of blackwater while the other half is dreading it edited by mrdoog 07 may 2012  1143 pm"
"Honey Badger",2012-05-07,"i liked the episode changes should be judged individually not biased against simply because they dont match the books a 11 adaptation would probably be rather boring ygritte i think is yummy sufficiently cute yet wild and the actress looks like a geek well done i guess she doesnt start her catchphrase you know nothing jon snow until later ser rodrick was properly handled and compressed they just dont have the screen time to show rodrick cavorting around and getting his arm hacked off and theon hacking rods head off is more meaningful than some random smith or helper rodrick was the one who taught theon how to swing a sword after all now theon will get a discreet story line with the bastard of bolton without rod involved danys dragon kidnap is kind of lame but they need to make up storyline for her dany for being the eventual invader of westeros is one of the most boring characters in the series im glad theyre doing something anything with that character aegon the conqueror by comparison seemed to have a lot more charisma which is funny since hes mainly a blurb and passing lore the reeds im glad were cut there was a fair amount of filler to brans journey and its fine that a warg can have green seeing dreams too might as well compress all that the only thing i think they should keep around is howland reeds role in fighting the kings guard with ned it was an awesome flashback with ned being sad about having to cut down noble men and how it wasnt a beginning but a sad end and the whole talk of bringing back the sword of the morning back to arthurs family great stuff"
"The Bastard of Bolton",2012-05-07,"i would of loved to see the ironborn scale the walls some whispers in the darkness before they closed in i know the sudden and unexpected nature of the attack is the point of it and hbo might have wanted to reflect that for the medium it would have felt a bit less awkward with a stealth invasion as a setup have bran having a bad dream of waves crashing on the shore have bran be relieved to be woken up by theon and then the switch"
"aimlessgun",2012-05-08,"ep didnt really work for me the entire lorch saga felt contrived littlefinger randomly showing up felt ridiculous considering distances jons part was cute and ygritte is doing an amazing job imo but i got too bogged down worrying how the fuck quorin is going to tell jon to kill him and if that doesnt happen wow dany is really coming off terribly in the show and i suppose its intentional showing her megalomaniacal andor childish side but its a bit annoying to experience on screen theon being all like surprise ive got winterfell threw me off from the beginning osha annoys the hell out of me for some reason purely personal prejudice id imagine probably some unfair comparisons to the reeds as well but bran and rodricks beheading were great anyways the ep made me realize that a lot of the pleasure i get from this show is contingent on seeing scenes from the books that i have in my imagination played out on screen if an episode doesnt give me anything in this regard i feel let down obviously doesnt have to be the whole episode but i think this one is the first where literally nothing went down like i pictured in my head edited by aimlessgun 08 may 2012  1209 am"

"Independent George",2012-05-08,"the opening sequence was my favorite part of the episode maybe my favorite part of the season i have absolutely nothing bad to say about it at allafter my initial shock at the dragon theft i thought that made a hell of a lot more sense than what happened in the books of course somebodys going to just go and steal her dragons my only question is why nobody tried it sooneri love the tywinarya scenes but i thought something was lost by having her kill amory lorch in that manner one of the great things about weeses death was that it made you wonder how in the hell did jaqen get the dog to turn on its master like that and what exactly was the extent of his powers i dont care much about adhering to the books events but such a mundane murder diminishes the subtle chills behind one of the great moments in the bookrobbtalisa fell flat and forced to me"

"ShadowRaven",2012-05-08,"i have to disagree with some of you saying the replacing scenes of aryabran were bettergood in my opinion they werent wanna know why because the whole point of their deaths were to write a drama and how the death of those characters affected the pov characters for example arya she was mistreated by the person overlooking her so she got him killed that could show the tv viewer that arya has a darker side they also killed the tikler off too fast now we wont see a scene where arya bloody murders him over and over by stabbing him over and over again that scene would be gold and maybe win her an emmy but no they had to do it dds way bugger them the whole point of mikkens death and the others were to show the readers the loyalty of the people of winterfell to the starks now instead of meaningfull peoples death we get to see half chopped too quickly deaths of characters who should have died differently the rodrik vs boltons bastard war would have geen gold the reeds entrance would be grand their introduction was best we swear it by fire and blood etc i know we cant have everything but they bloody blew it in my opinion edited by shadowraven 08 may 2012  0237 am"

"Morpheus",2012-05-08,"i too thought lorchs death was hilarious and the fact that is was seemingly impossible set up just how good th fm are at killing i fully expect for there to be fallout from tywin witnessing an assassination on his doorstep so that will probably add more differences to the story yes it would have been cool to see amory meet his end with the bear but who knows if they will even have the bloody mummers i am sure they can have someone else capture jaime on the road i thought the opening was excellent and the dragon theft is intriguing for now lets see where they go with it next week"
"WinterWarrior",2012-05-08,"i totally disagree  i thought this was a great episode and the beginning with theon taking winterfell was almost exactly like it was in the book the other deviations were necessary because this is a television adaptation of the books and has to adapt to a television audience many who have never read the books danys dragons being stolen adds some much needed drama to the dany story in qarth i always thought it was unrealistic in the books that no one ever stole themreally her small raggled group with three dragons and no one ever tried to just take them in this bloodthirsty world that is essos i am interested in seeing how this plays into her scenes in the hofu"

"Evamitchelle",2012-05-08,"i have to disagree with some of you saying the replacing scenes of aryabran were bettergood in my opinion they werent wanna know whybecause the whole point of their deaths were to write a drama and how the death of those characters affected the pov characters for example arya she was mistreated by the person overlooking her so she got him killed that could show the tv viewer that arya has a darker side they also killed the tikler off too fast now we wont see a scene where arya bloody murders him over and over by stabbing him over and over again that scene would be gold and maybe win her an emmy but no they had to do it dds way bugger themi agree that they killed off the tickler at the entirely wrong time its not like they were lacking in lannister men to have arya kill either that guy who stole her sword and threatened to beatkill her would have been a perfect replacement for weese whom arya ordered killed because he hit her but with the tickler gone there wont be that future stabbity is there gold in the village  scene later while i find its one of aryas most important scenesthe whole point of mikkens death and the others were to show the readers the loyalty of the people of winterfell to the starks now instead of meaningfull peoples death we get to see half chopped too quickly deaths of characters who should have died differentlythe rodrik vs boltons bastard war would have geen goldthe reeds entrance would be grand their introduction was best we swear it by fire and blood etci know we cant have everything but they bloody blew it in my opinioni disagree with this however for me it was hands down the best scene of the entire season so far even more impactful than in the books im slightly baffled as to how rodrik came from torrhens square on his own though but otherwise i thought this scene was perfect maester luwin desperately trying to send his raven first brans intitial lack of reaction at the whole thing farlen speaking up against theon and theon eventually going along with rodriks execution while bran loses it in the background even the music when theon ragekills rodrik was pretty topnotch they should have nominated alfie allen for the emmys instead of kit harrington imoand i still think the reeds can have a good entrance in season 3 just not in winterfell edited by evamitchelle 08 may 2012  0913 am"
"Strider",2012-05-08,"im happy to see that so many people have made the adjustment and are now accepting that changes inevitably must be made for a television adaptation of martins books there are some core plot events and characterizations that probably must be included in any adaptation that might be an interesting thread in itself but the writers must be given plenty of latitude and freedom the question is not are the writers being faithful to the books in every detail but are they giving us a entertaining compelling drama that is faithful in spirit to the books if they accomplish the latter then they have accomplished something wonderful i am thoroughly enjoying game of thrones its some of the best television i have seen in years and i feel sorry for those who are unable to appreciate it on its own terms because their imaginations are too tied to the books we need to be honest martins books cannot be successfully translated to the screen as they stand they are too long too convoluted too dense martin has created so many plot threads we are all wondering if hell be able to to convincingly pull it all altogether some of the stuff in these books is just bad the first book in the series was relatively easy to render into a miniseires but the difficulties for successful translation increase exponentially for each successive title its all quite the narrative nightmare and that is why i think the writers are doing a splendid job not a perfect job but a splendid job nonetheless they are working with very difficult source material i have my own criticisms of the series but my criticisms have to do with the television presentation on its own terms not with the changes the writers have made to the books game of thrones is an adaptation of song of ice and fire it is not a visual transcription of the books its an adaptation if you want to enjoy the show you have to temporarily forget the books let the writers and directors surprise you this is outstanding television this kind of television doesnt happen very often"
"ghost the direwolf",2012-05-08,"i have no problem with the changes made i liked this episode from beginning to end the scene with lorch was ok since it showed how quick and skilled jaqen is as a fm daenerysneeds to be busy and i like the intrigue theon invading winterfell was actually good for me i am now ok with the fact that the show will not follow the book totally but as long as the end result is the same the acting good i am fine"

"Septon Meribald",2012-05-08,"honestly id prefer any changes that are made to have a reason that being said i dont necessarily mind changes i just ask that they make sense ser rodrik being beheaded by theon has emotional implications and removes the need for the battle outside winterfell which im sure would cause time and budget issues this is ok with me what im not ok with is hearing the episode before that ser rodrik was emptying winterfell to go defend torhens square and then find him back at winterfell by himself either he returned with his hundreds of men who were slaughtered by theons dozen while they were also in the middle of securing winterfell and rounding up its inhabitants or he heard of the attack on winterfell and decided it would be easier to protect it without an army a minor nitpick about the kings landing riot is that other than budgetary constraints and really how much would it cost i can see absolutely no reason why a king would be walking through the city as for the dragon theft i understand the desire for motivation for dany but i thought there was already ample motivation i have no power to take back westeros the rulers of qarth wont help me the warlocks say they will i will go to them this seems like a reasonable and ample motivation for dany to go to the house of the undying it also makes her betrayal once there more meaningful"

"FantA´me",2012-05-08,"also in the books robb just shows up with a wife why not let him fall in love on the battlefield because its a big change in robbs character  him marrying jeyne westerling was due to a moment of very understandable weakness after hearing his two young brothers were murdered by the person he considered a brother as well and who would never had been able to do it if it wasnt for robb letting him go and to his stupid nedlike honor who made it impossible for him not to assume his responsibilities towards the girl he had dishonoredthats not exactly the same as breaking a promise because of some girl he fall in love with on the battlefield  though we dont know whats going to happen exactly so maybe it wont look as stupid as i fear it will"
"Sxxman",2012-05-08,"i think that people who have read the books make the mistake on reviewing a got episode based on how well it follows the books rather than how good the episode is on its own merits as a reader i understand its tough to separate the two cuz its an adaptation but it is necessary to im not trying to be rude here but it seems like some people just turn their brain off when they see something different from the book and immediately doom the series because they refuse to see why the writers might have made these changes and refuse to see how it plays out the first one that comes to mind is dany having her dragons kidnapped i saw a fan review of the episode on youtube and they literally said the biggest negativedragonnappingnot in the bookyeah without even taking the effort to see why that change was made and letting it play out before condemning it to me it was an interesting twist because one it keeps even the bookreaders on their toes two dany needs to learn that you cant just go around yelling at leaders of cities demanding armies and loyalty when you have no leverage the reason why no one ever kidnapped her dragons in the books wasnt because she wouldnt allow it but because i dont believe anyone tried i believe that she will get the dragons back and the kidnapping will give her more justification to burn the tower down as well as teach her a lesson in humility if not her character will become insufferable to the main audience imo the second complaint i hear is about lady talissa hbo casted oona chaplin as jeyne westerling it defies logic that theyll bait and switch her character to lady talissa of volantis it seems to me that she is jeyne but shes keeping her id secret from the stark camp because she is actually a spy for the lannisters the note on tywins desk looked suspiciously like the one talissa was writing the romance and rw will still happen the whole reeds storyline can still happen also maybe osha brings bran to the reeds in season 3 because she believes they can help bran sure it is different but again wait and see by the way we dont even know if howland reed does anything important in the books we assume he will but we dont know for sure i guess what im trying to say without trying to sound like a pretentiousdbagwhodefendstheshowatallcosts is that lets not assume that the departures from the books are bad until we see where those departures end up if they dont do the characters than we can launch our fullscale criticisms to the writers but until then wait and see"

"elonepb",2012-05-08,"there are a bunch of deviations from the book but i havent been upset about many and regarding danys dragon heist i think this might be partly a way to give an exciting plot twist to her character as many have suggested but also ive read in numerous places that budgeting for the show is obviously limited so theyve tried and limited the amount of time weve actually seen dragons usually its only 1 and the rest are in their cage and just referred to through visual cues or sounds i cant recall in the book whether dany brings a dragon with her into the hotu but i seem to think she did if so they would need to have this cgi dragon with her the entire time as opposed to just having her rescue them somehow and achieving the same end goal btw first post love everyones comments glad to be a member now"
"Sword of the Morning Wood",2012-05-08,"it seemed all so sudden and so unnatural im referring to the opening of this weeks episode the acting seemed forced and not naturali thought the opening was fantastic and very well acted it was a powerful scene imo from brans initial reaction to theon to farlens insult to rodriks defiance and especially when rodrik was executedand not to mention the huge diversion from the books this whole episode seemed 40 different from the books which  yes  did bother meim referring to the way theon captured winterfell how rodrik died how lf presented himself to tywin and how impossible jaqens killing of that dude who couldnt read seemed i mean i know the fm can do some pretty epic shizzle but not in that way it seemed too forcedif there are differences in the show which are silly or make it worse ill say so i dont like this bitter fanboy attitude of any difference  badtheon captured winterfell in eaxctly the same way he did in the bookstheyve obviously chosen to omit rodriks seige and ramseys attack it would have been cool to see imo but its not vital and it makes sense to kill rodrik this way if thats whats going to happeni didnt really like lf appearing at harrenhal mostly because i know it how long it would take him to get from kl to renly to harrenhal but i dont see the major problem apart from it being different to the book lf is crucial in building the lannister  tyrell alliance and thats all the show is portrayinghow was lorchs death impossible jaqen is known from the books to be an incredibly skilled assassin possibly with magical abilities or at least abilities which would appear magic to people who dont understand them are you saying that compeltely chaging his physical appearance to realistic believable and a great storyline but him managing to kill lorch unnoticed just before he gets to tywin is ridiculousask yourself if martin had written it the way the tv show has gone and the tv show had then changed it to the way martin wrote it would you be congratulating hbo on great writing or ranting on here that it was too differentor how about that dragon storyline for daenarys i know i know its television and needs to be different or otherwise she wouldnt have a big role but still it seemed too different now dany will probably go to the house of the undying because her dragons were stolen no such thing happened in the booksim going to wait to see how this plays out before i judge it"
"ShadowRaven",2012-05-08,"even if grrm had written these scenes  which i doubt somehow  i would still be upset about it the main reason i like asoiaf is because of the vivid details and time it takes to show you epic moments not the rushed moments like in the series sort of that cant be helped however but it can be helped to put priorities like how come we have an actress taking the role of a whore and getting air time while the reeds and boltons bastard is neglected of course the ramsay is gonna make a show but it all depends how if they ruin jons meeting with mance im going to be even more upset oh well"

"SerMixalot",2012-05-08,"i for one am finding myself questioning alot of the creative choices being made i initially was just accepting them as required for budgeting and time and all like that but the more i think of it the writers could have stayed much closer to the book and stayed within budget and time many of their choices are just lame creating the whole talisa story line is weak weak weak it would have been far cooler to have a scene with robb meeting his mother with his new bride and trying to explain having cat hanging with robb at this point messes up so much of the character development it strikes me as the writers are chickening out on the story telling they have to show robb the have to show dany despite their secondary roles in the 2nd book sucks really"

"Drogon's Personal Trainer",2012-05-08,"a thought about the new robb storyline i just wonder whether the programme makers are doing their best to get the audience to invest much more in robb and feel a greater emotional tie to him throughout the rest of this series and however many episodes of the next until we get to you know what they are no doubt hoping to give that event even greater impact its the sort of thing they would do unnecessary i know but that may be the way they are thinking and yet again  yawn  theyve no doubt had feedback about the girlies liking richard madden imho they are not handling the storyline quite right though something seems very false about it"
"Septon Meribald",2012-05-08,"i get the stuff about laying on joffreys cuntishness too think although martin does this again and again in the books he wrote about joffrey shooting hares for sport shooting commoners at the gates of the red keep and telling them to eat their dead if they were hungry the show hasnt done that so imo theyre not laying it on any thicker than the books did if it was unnecessary in the show it was also unnecessary in the books although you could argue that the show has to be more selective in where it spends its timethe difference is in the books these were asides someone remembers the time joffrey cut open a cat to see if it was prenant one paragraph sansa observes joffrey firing a crossbow at the gates half a page before talking to him and being abused as we are updated on the events in kings landing and the larger war using 10 of an episode to show that joffrey is a dick is well beyond whats necessary if you want to have that in the show open on a scene where he pronounces a harsh sentence you say he stole from you he says you lie ser ilyn remove that mans hand and that mans tongue then a one liner about how pathetic the commoners are and proceed with the important scene"

"Envie",2012-05-10,"im with the camp that felt this wasnt a huge deal having myrcella crying honestly watch it again yes shes visibly crying but shes not sobbing uncontrollably or reaching for her mother or being a child which she still is one shes sitting there like a very poised young lady trying to fight back tears that are coming anyways and shes holding her back straight her head up highonly pain in her eyes as shes going further away from the only life shes ever had this is a terrifying moment for a young girl and i feel the actress did a good job of showing it without spoiling any sort of characterization for myrcella its a very minor detail in light of all the major ones theyve changed in the series really"

"turdle",2012-05-10,"for me personally some of the most irritating changes have been the small ones for example changing the three eyed crow into a three eyed raven honestly the irritation is less about what was changed but that something was changed for virtually no reason and while i did not remember that in the book that marcella didnt cry i do find it irritating that they changed it the bigger changes tend to make more sense to me i get why they would combine scenarios here or there and cut out some characters and so on but when the difference amounts to a character saying crow instead of raven or having a little girl not cry instead of cry it just makes me feel like dd feel like changing things just because they can"

"Raja",2012-05-11,"wow some of the abuse on here is quite unreal  firstly though for those holding out on giving a verdict due to the season not reaching its climax  i dont think thats a good argument mostly because each episode should be able to be judged by itself  independently  it cannot all be set up  take mad men for example the robb story does not bother me one bit  it would be quite impossible having him just show up with a bride with no set up at all  i dont think that would work on television  there is alot of stuff which works on paper and does not work on screen  for example the house of the undying works fine on paper but showing that visually would be kind of gimmky which is why i think having the oona chaplin lady talissa scenes are necessary as long as the added scenes stay in the essence of the book scenes like cersei and roberts conversation about their marriage and selmy robert jamie talking about their first kill  i dont think one should be that critical edited by raja 11 may 2012  0323 am"

"Raksha the Demon",2012-05-11,"ran earlier you put forward a reasonable idea about judging got according to two axes faithfulness and standalone merit dont know if it was this thread or somewhere else i agree with that assessment and it seems to me that making a 180 purely based on faithfulness disregards the other axis the standalone merit of the show if myrcellas tears make sense within the logic of the television show it cant be as terrible a change as some people make it out to be its not faithful but thats only one part of the equationi wasnt thrilled by myrcellas tears when grrm took pains to mention that she was composed and selfconfident as she set out for dorne but i can see why they wrote the scene that way  to add emphasis to cerseis bitternesssorrow as she tells tyrion that she hopes that he will love someonesomething someday so she can take it away from him the camera cut to weepy myrcella before or after cerseis little speech to tyrion i guess the writers thought that having a calm brave myrcella waving byebye from the boat would undercut the cerseityrion drama they could have managed it better by cutting some of that dreadful and awkward robbtalisa banter and shown myrcella crying on the dock making her farewells then wiping her eyes bravely and smiling as she sets off for her new life but its not the worst of the many changes theyve made and the episode was rosfree laughpng classbbcemoticon altlaugh "

"Ser Greguh",2012-05-11,"as someone who when i take the time to post in these sorts of threads is often accused of being one of the more forceful antinitpickers it seems like this thread affords a good opportunity to justify that position in a bit more detailin doing so ill focus on two main themes the first is rather simple the purists mindset is at a base psychological level not one that i identify with nor one that i condoneput simply while i certainly claim and own the lable of an asoiaf geek to the core  i can name every targaryen king from memory i have the books all but memorized i could write multiple essays discussing rlj from many different viewpoints  theres an aspect to geekhood with which i have never identified and that is put simply that in order to love something we must first disavow it of any flaws wil wheaton did a very nice essay on the phenomenon of geekdom a while back which boiled down to being a geek is awesome because it means we get to love things without shame without the weight of being cool about it without worrying about the judgment of othersi think thats very true and i embrace that mindset but unfortunately i think that the more a fan descends into nitpicking the more that love shows a darker side and looks less like an innocent admiration and more like a possessive stalker just because we love something doesnt mean we have to think its flawless i remember complaints in s1 when catelyn didnt deliver the line to jon snow that it should have been you i remember thinking that it was so far beyond silly to mourn the loss of such a terrible line but then it occurs to me that so many readers dont realize that its a terrible line and the reason for that is most likely that so many of the fans are so unhealthily in love with the series that theyve managed to blind themselves to its warts and worse sometimes seem to accuse those who suggest that it even has warts is somehow treasonousi simply dont think thats healthy its an aspect of geekhood that ive never identified with loving something doesnt mean we have to defend its every last detail and its not mutually exclusive to love these books and say still make fun of grrms frankly rather awful writing tic of many and more someone whose gut reaction amounts to its different so it sucks simply doesnt communicate to me on a very fundamental levelto be a purist one must first see something as pure its not its a book its not a holy textthe second point is far more involved and much more difficult to articulate without coming across very poorly so ill tread carefully nevertheless the point is that the factors of which a good adaptation is made are far far more intricate than most people give them credit foradaptation is hard seriously amazingly jawdroppingly soulcrushingly hard harder than most nonwriters could possibly imagine what seems to some like it should just be a simple 11 translation  take the words from the page kill the unnecessary ones and translate the rest to screenplay format  takes on a level of complexity that is difficult to imagine when you put it through the filter of what consitutes a good visual storyits easy to forgive and not really possible to know this unless youve done much writing youve tried to adapt something within the context of professional work or youve spent considerable time doing criticism you have to know how the sausage is made plain and simple theres a very good reason why the majority of fanfiction is pure and utter crap and theres a reason why grrm is a lot less of a purist with regard to his own damn books than so many of his fans are its because hes been around the block more than once and understands that the vast majority of the nitpicks deal with choices that he likely never saw as sanctified to begin with a lot of them were almost certainly 5149 type decisions that can easily tilt the other way in the adaptation process and thus his meh whatever reaction is likely quite justifiedtake the example of the decision to have myrcella cry as shes departing kings landing its explicitly different from the books and thus causes massive consternation from the purists zomg they got it wrong didnt they even read the books are they even tryingwell no thats totally wrong there is a very very good reason to make that change the first and foremost being that theres a very specific reason that works in the books and unfortunately that reason is next to impossible to translate to film the scene in the books works not because of some inherent power to a child being separated from their family but because grrm is able to have tyrion specifically comment on it in an internal monologue that shows in one fell swoop his love for his family his respect for myrcella and his disdain for much of the rest of his family so how do you bring that to the screen well you can just have tyrion make the comment out loud but to whom cersei bronn sandor he doesnt have a confidant in the party  his only true confidant in all of kings landing is shae  and so to have him recite a line in admiration of myrcellas stoicism simply doesnt work for the scene and so youd have nothing more than a girl being rowed away from her family thats not crying which without the background commentary comes off as a bit awkward out of place and bizarre possibly the result of sloppy direction or of having an actress thats unable to cry convincingly i guarantee you that the scene would seem off its a choice that makes perfect sense and that doesnt really change much of anything important there are plenty of ways to show myrcella as strong and composed if it becomes important and a girl crying upon being separated from her family is hardly mutually exclusive with thator say the lack of a peach its a consequence of changes to the character that were quite frankly probably necessary renly in the books is a foppish joker who takes nothing seriously and sees everything even his being crowned king as a game but thats a personality type that simply doesnt play as well on screen in the context the books have unlimited room to contextualize and rationalize his behavior and grrm does a very nice job of setting up that mindset though he also doesnt seem to arrive there until about the prologue of the second book with maester cressons internal monologue about renly as a child and how nothing has changed showrenly is considerably different and much more built upon the urgency and moral pragmatism that he shows in his s1 plea for ned to support his claim which if you think about it in the books is actually quite different from his persona elsewhere in the books its clear that dd set renly up to be a more sympathetic more consistent moral voice who crowned himself as much because he felt he was assuaging a moral duty to not allow the iron throne to fall to a catastrophic king such as joffrey or stannis instead of just being the enormous douchenozzle he is in the books claiming the throne basically because he can and because he thinks hell be awesome at it and stuff so the whimsical taunting utterly arrogant renly that we see in the books negotiating with his brother via taunting jesting and offering a peach simply wouldnt fit showrenly is completely different and yet i dont see nearly as many people commenting on this in a negative way as i see complaining that one of their favorite iconic images had to be altered for consistencygenerally speaking the sort of whimsical fopishness works much better on the page than it does on the screen particularly of a dark series like this one littlefingers tendency in the books for example to dress in bright gaudy outfits so that no one takes him seriously would have been disastrous in the adaptationso what people see as pointless changes arent really theyre just choices made by writers and directors that so far have very much seemed on top of things very much know what theyre doing and understand intimately that the biggest change of all is that the story isnt being told with words but rather a moving picture and sounds the ramifications of that go a whole lot deeper than i think a lot of people here understandand i dont want this to mean that there arent changes or omissions in the adaptation that im not happy with in particular i dont like for example that theyve largely cut shae and tyrions interactions in the series so far since a big part of the tyrion storyline in the books is not just that hes a devious player and ubercompetent hand but also that hes deeply immensely happy in the process not the least of which because he has the dream pseudogirlfriend to go home to at night and relieve his stresses it was important to communicate just how much he loves what hes doing and shae was a big part of that i think itll make his frustration at eventually having that power slip quite a bit less powerfulhowever id like to think that thats a position thats a bit more sophisticated than zomg they made her sansas maid way too early edited by ser greguh 11 may 2012  0550 pm"
"Ran",2012-05-11,"ser greguhon the face of it wellreasoned except you know the implication that the purists are only arguing from the position of zomg is rather beneath you just because some people do not discuss every nuance of why theyre annoyed when theres pages of nuanced discussion and critique already doesnt mean their positions lack nuance they just havent expressed it  or just as possibly youve chosen to just treat it all as zomgfurthermore there is some kind of arrogance in trying to guarantee to people that your hypothetical is some sort of unchallengable proof eh no no it isnt you can at best guarantee your belief that it would be true but you know that you dont actually know you just believe that in the film in your head itd be off thats a belief not a factand to get to specificsfrankly the fact that joffrey himself comments on tears  his brothers tears  is enough to make you consider what it means that myrcella is not crying the tremulous lip the rigid back the stiff look  without needing a word you know doesnt need tears doesnt need much acting even the poorest actors can generally look stiff and rigid a little bite of a lip  perfect the line of the mouth is now that of someone trying to control themselvesyou know what that is subtlety letting you figure it out you have a bit of prior knowledge of sweet myrcella babbling happily about dresses and weddings and then you have stoic myrcella with a tremulous lip and a moist eye and you can fit the pieces together because youre clever and youve watched enough drama to figure it out you can contrast that with joffrey and with tommen oh tommens so sweet and gentle but it looks like myrcella has more spine even though you can see shes about to cry too nothing like that ass joffreyand for that matter a confidant if you really must spell it out because you believe hbo audiences cant put two and two together with any reliability well you know theres someone who tyrion might have made that remark to and given it some further layering sansa especially after joffrey complains at her interjection twothree lines pointing out how myrcellas lack of tears is utterly different from joffreys callous disregard putting him in his place again adding to that bad mood thatll trigger the riot nice sweet as i imagine it in my head another bit of interaction between tyrion and sansa since he rescued her from that beating another sign of his understanding and regard for her and her difficult position another chance to build tension between him and joffrey that triggers something very bad indeed and may be a prelude a foreshadowing of things to comecan i guarantee that would work nope not my line but what i do know is that i can imagine a number of ways in which they could have stayed true to that defining moment for myrcella without asking heroic acting on anyones part  a rigid back a bitten lip a saline drop or two to the eyes  and i have to imagine they could have done it but someone somewhere decided that having her in tears was better were they right i dont think so its a nuance one of the few that character has it complicates rather than simplifies its good to have complexityalso ill trust you only watched part of the renlystannis scene because his joking about the banners making it easier to tell their armies apart and smoke and salt is he a ham was perfectly fitting the character in the novel the idea that renly did not joke and taunt and grin his way through that confrontation on the show is very strange to mei would also suggest that you dont know how much of a purist george is in fact hes explicitly said that when he watches adaptations he is very much a purist by nature he wants to see things as close as he imagined he knows adaptation is hard he knows compromises must be made but id bet you a dollar that if you asked him off the record if he wrote that departure scene would he have had myrcella crying or not im pretty sure he would at least have said hed have tried it without the tears can i guarantee itnope not in that line but i know george pretty well and i know what hes said about the show in public and there he has said that there are choices the show makes that would not have been his own choices put that together with his being a purist by heart and wonder how he might feel at minor details being dropped or changed seemingly at random often to less effect than what he intended sure he can put with it  50 60 70 80 whatever of his story is getting up there thats better than 0 theres things to admire things to be in awe at things to enjoy and it opens his work to a bigger audience and thats a plus but ill bet you he hopes all those viewers go on to read his books and to enjoy his novel the real version better than the showdoes he demand absolute fidelity no impossible he knows it would he like fidelity wherever it were possible i think the answer is yes hes not going to throw a fit over it as you say a seasoned pro

"SerMixalot",2012-05-11,"ummm with regards to renlys character show renly has had relatively limited screentime but it seems that the intent of book and show was to make him out to be a shallow douchenozzle upjumping to become king ie movitvated by lorass praise and lusty motivations holding a tournament while marching to war a decent dialogue insulting his brother while eating a peach would have been perfectly in keepinlg with what grrm wrote and what the viewer should expect his character went from something interesting with understandable motives younger vain son supported by ambitious powerful allies getting at his older stodgier brother to a boring one dimensional character rather forgettable in the long run i mean really after watching this season i really had stake in his character i didnt care if he lived or died he was essentially background by enlivening him making him more like book renly which would have taken little change to the dialogue he would have stood out as a smaller version of robert as copper to roberts steel and stannis iron if you will change for changes sake that lessened the series artistic appeal"

"Bastard of Boston",2012-05-11,"you know i tend to be on the side of those who are willing to give adaptations the benefit of the doubt but if nothing else i do enjoy the dialog between those who really rally for tight adherence to the source material and those who give more leeway really insightful stuff"
"Ser Greguh",2012-05-11,"ser greguhon the face of it wellreasoned except you know the implication that the purists are only arguing from the position of zomg is rather beneath you just because some people do not discuss every nuance of why theyre annoyed when theres pages of nuanced discussion and critique already doesnt mean their positions lack nuance they just havent expressed it  or just as possibly youve chosen to just treat it all as zomgi dont treat it all as zomg but some of it very clearly is i can address and most likely respect any argument even if i disagree with if it communicates why something is bad in the context of the show a visual medium and an adaptation but just as often the argument seems to be its different therefore its bad full stop and thats a pointofview that i have little patience forfurthermore there is some kind of arrogance in trying to guarantee to people that your hypothetical is some sort of unchallengable proof eh no no it isnt you can at best guarantee your belief that it would be true but you know that you dont actually know you just believe that in the film in your head itd be off thats a belief not a factim not saying i have access to any kind of unchallengable proof but insofar as things are opinion well kind of a lot of the suggestions  complaints deal with perspectives that while they may not be wrong insofar as nothing can be wrong in something as subjective as criticizing a work of art at the very least constitute pretty big deviations from very wellaccepted visual storytelling norms to take this to an extreme i remember suggestions back before the show was ever greenlit that the best way to keep the pov structure would be to have each chapter told exclusively through the eyes of that character with the camera literally representing their eyes a suggestion only a trueblue purist could make not in jest some things can be addressed reasonably and some things are just  no it wouldnt work most suggestions arent anywhere near that extreme but they still show imo an ignorance of the nuances of visual storytelling that arent present in prose and thus dont really constitute reasonable ideasand to get to specificsfrankly the fact that joffrey himself comments on tears  his brothers tears  is enough to make you consider what it means that myrcella is not crying the tremulous lip the rigid back the stiff look  without needing a word you know doesnt need tears doesnt need much acting even the poorest actors can generally look stiff and rigid a little bite of a lip  perfect the line of the mouth is now that of someone trying to control themselvesyou know what that is subtlety letting you figure it out you have a bit of prior knowledge of sweet myrcella babbling happily about dresses and weddings and then you have stoic myrcella with a tremulous lip and a moist eye and you can fit the pieces together because youre clever and youve watched enough drama to figure it out you can contrast that with joffrey and with tommen oh tommens so sweet and gentle but it looks like myrcella has more spine even though you can see shes about to cry too nothing like that ass joffreylet me rephrase because this is a point of communication disconnect its negative space and its a basically a straightforward screenwriting blunder the intent may be to come across as subtle but it basically never works film audiences will never notice the absence of a something in this case myrcellas tears unless a character specifically comments on it the same is true for prose except its far less problematic because the majority of prose is internal monologue so a character noticing an absence of something is directly translatable to the readerfrom a screen perspective their choices are basically1 have myrcella not cry not point it out appeasing the purists but run the risk of viewers drawing an unconscious parallel between myrcella and joffrey totally contrary to their intent and rely on the audience to get it without the help of internal monologue2 have myrcella not cry and point it out running the risk of having a line appear clumsy and outofplace potentially ruining the flow of the sceneor 3 just let her cry reinforcing to the viewers who lets remember are allbut overwhelmed with the character list and likely barely remember her name even most of the smart ones that shes a sweet girl who bottomline misses her familyits the simple choice it makes perfect sense from the perspective of the story its far from an abandonment of her character her crying here is not inconsistent with her developing a more mature stoicism later and its a tertiary character to begin withwe can argue back and forth and im not saying that its absolutely impossible to make another choice and have it work just that the people saying theyre obviously just changing it without a reason have no basis for that complaint all things considered this has been a very faithful adaptation and they clearly know the books inside and out so the chances of this being a change that was made just because are basically nil similarly the chances that they explored other possibilities and settled on this one for a specific reason i would say is pretty high many of the accusations thrown dds way seem to me to be thinlyveiled baselevel attacks regarding their overall attention to detail which i think is way out of linealso ill trust you only watched part of the renlystannis scene because his joking about the banners making it easier to tell their armies apart and smoke and salt is a ham was perfectly fitting the character in the novel the idea that renly did not joke and taunt and grin his way through that confrontation on the show is very strange to mecmon man you really think i only watched half that scene is that really the impression that im giving here he throws a barb at melisandre a stranger whos making pompous proclamations and just because theyve redone the character as a bit more serious a bit more of a selfimagined reluctant and ultimately tragic hero doesnt mean theyve completely excised his ability to take the piss out of someone but as the negotiation starts for real and its stannis and stannis only that hes interacting with the brotherly issues boil to the surface and the quips are discarded in favor of the anger toward his brothers stubborn refusal to accept that hes won the love of his subjects the men holding those banners will make me king in a way that stannis never will the ground for that animosity was laid in the hunting scene with robert more than someone whos just playing a game and in it for the lulz renly has been fairly subtly adjusted to someone who truly believes that things are fucked up truly believes that hes a better solution than anyone else in large part due to lorass influence and simply thinks that its a foregone conclusion that his superior numbers will win the dayits certainly not the only choice but its a choice and it makes a lot of sense given the context in which theyve established the character i think that if there were no such thing as the books the series was an original work and existed exactly as it has right up until that moment if hed just quipped and joked his way through the entire negotiation the general reaction would be wha thats not renly the same guy that bitterly admonished his brother for making the eight is now just a glib little wiseassand for the record i much prefer showrenly to bookrenly never really did like renly in the books though i did like his line of you may have the better claim but i have the larger armyi would also suggest that you dont know how much of a purist george is in fact hes explicitly said that when he watches adaptations he is very much a purist by nature he wants to see things as close as he imagined he knows adaptation is hard he knows compromises must be made but id bet you a dollar that if you asked him off the record if he wrote that departure scene would he have had myrcella crying or not im pretty sure he would at least have said hed have tried it without the tears can i guarantee itnope not in that line but i know george pretty well and i know what hes said about the show in public and there he has said that there are choices the show makes that would not have been his own choicesdoes he demand absolute fidelity no impossible he knows it would he like fidelity wherever it were possible i think the answer is yesi certainly concede that you know george far better than i do ive never met him in point of fact and im not saying that his instinct isnt one of a purist but at the same time ive also seen that hes made comments on notablog that would certainly support my side admonishing however gently fans who get upset over the slightest deviations obviously hes pragmatic with regard to issues of trimming things down for timebudget but from what i saw of the pointy end a faithful but not absolutely faithful adaptation of that portion of the book also has a fairly keen understanding of the differences between book mechanics and screen mechanics i dont know how he would have written the scenes were debating but i at least like to think his reaction to watching them was more nuanced than they changed it this sucks"

"Envie",2012-05-09,"i really loved this scene and am so glad they have added it in light of so many others dropped from the story the sansan theme is very poignant in a love that can never be kind of way its also the growing up point for sansa who learns that not all knights are beautiful and honorable as shes fantasized about growing up shes already gotten a good taste of exactly now nasty kings can be from joffrey so now she is learning that even the ugly deformed and surly hound has a chivalrous side the symbolism is so perfect for the series as well as the books nothing is as it seems and no one is all good or all bad"

"Liathano",2012-05-09,"yeah i was stoked about the little bird reference but felt like it fell flat 1 because he said it so quietly and 2 because it was thrown in with no backstory ah well  also what happened to the halfwit girl who was gangbanged for wont of a better term"
"scurvy",2012-05-09,"i hope sansa says thank you ser for saving me in an upcoming scene and he says bugger on your ser and explains the knight bs and how its not all songs and glory its death and worse and tells the story of his burning making the littlefinger scene at the hands tourney that much more annoying"

"Caro99",2012-05-09,"it was a beautiful episode for me due to sansa  the hound of course it was horrible to watch sansa almost being raped but sandor was perfect and managed to find her before the worse happened and he finally called her lb twice besides the lb is bleeding someone take her back to her cage and see to that cut bit i loved it and i am realllllly looking forward to next weeks episode rory  sophie can really do some wonderful acting i also think dontos may finally reappear until the 10th episode apparently he was in some of the scenes in episode 4 when sansa was being beaten in the throne room but he was mostly cut out of them  i agree that the show is hinting greatly to the future tyrionsansa marriage which i dont like that much i love tyrion and peter dinklage but the hound is my favorite thank the gods they had tyrion in this episode stating a reason why they need to keep sansa safe jaime or it wouldve all come out wrong if he was hanging around after he was back safely in the castle waiting to see if sansa came back i suppose that it is due to the marriage between them next season that we are also getting the whole sansashae situation so it can build up tension between these two and tyrion as well i guess"

"TheWrongKindOfSnow",2012-05-10,"i was surprised tyrion saw jofferys reaction ordering the crowd killed after being hit by a mud pie as particularly evilmad considering the standards hes judging by wouldnt most kings and other people of importance have a sense of their own superiority high enough to be affronted by the insult it seemed theyd not been particularly smart regarding the security of the lannisters and sansa in the first place the books had them mounted with mounted gaurds for the riot didnt it i dont know that tyrions concern about sansa implies hes falling for her in preparation for the later marriage the whole theme of the marriage is that tyrion doesnt feel that way about sansa  he sees her as an innocent child and as the victim of his familys schemes which also explain his concern for her in this scene pity that the hound and tyrion cant bond over their mutual weakness for sansa  youd think both of them could use someone extra on his side i wonder what joffery would have thought of the hounds heroic rescue btw did it strike anyone else that his concern for sansa was kind of undermined by his rather rough way of carrying her to safety i guess thats part of his nature though i was also wondering why the hound puts up with joffery speaking to him the way he does"

"Team Shaggydog",2012-05-12,"been lurking for awhile but i registered because i was surprised that no one that ive seen anyway has yet interpreted this scene the way i did immediately it seemed obvious to me actually and now im wondering if im just making up subtext in my head if im alone in this but i thought qhorin knew right away that jon wasnt going to be able to kill ygritte when he volunteered and thats why he rushed the other rangers away to leave jon alone with her because he knew jon would let her go i thought qhorins plan was that when their party came upon mance ygritte would vouch for jon and hed be taken prisoner or allowed to join them so then the nw would have jon on the inside i came to that conclusion because qhorin point blank asked her what happen if he himself were to be taken prisoner and she said theyd kill him so thats when he figured jon would be their double agent i dont know if he knew jon would be lugging her around indecisively the way he is which might be the reason why they made themselves scarce when jon tried to rejoin them with her tied up but im pretty sure he knew when he left them alone together that she wasnt going to die thoughts"

"jarl the climber",2012-05-12,"i think ghost will find them when they are waking up and ygritte will freak out thinking that it is going to eat her and jon jon will be like no problem hes my buddy and shell be like your a warg and hell say get the hell out of here and we will get our first you know nothing jon snow"
"Jayaris",2012-05-12,"shorti just watched the scene and quorhin asks ygritte what the wildlings would do to him if he was capturedhe pulls out a sword and says it needs to be done want me to do itjon says noquorhin says dont take too longi think youre really overstating how unambigious the statement is he at no point in the scene orders jon to kill her in the book you havewhat needs to be donein the show you haveit needs to be doneit would be in no way a stretch to suggest that quorhin knew he would let her go which is why he gave him a false rendezvous point and that it was a test of character  as in the booksby the tone of the thread i would of expected quorhin to say jon snow better off this wildling son  or elsemaybe i missed some hidden footage where that actually happenedotherwise i do not see how this could be considered a plot holethe only stupid thing in the scene was the ambiguity of whether or not jon missed on purpose or not"
"House Snow",2012-05-12,"i think they are trying to set up a believable way for the wildings to take jon in the book it seemed sort of a jump in logic for them to take him in out even in the untrusting way that they did it probably still wont be believable but it will probably make more sense then the book"
"King Cheops",2012-05-12,"when i saw it i just assumed that qhorin saw that jon fancied ygritte so was leaving him alone to rape her then kill her he and the men were just giving snow some privacy"
"kungtotte",2012-05-13,"in the books you have qhorin wanting to figure out more about jon snow who he has heard a lot about jon was the one who saved the old bears life when the wight attacked him after all that is why he tells jon to do what needs to be done about ygritte afterwards when he finds out jon didnt do it something he already suspected he tells him he would have used ebben if he desperately wanted her dead or done it himselfthen why did you command it of mei did not command it i told you to do what needed to be done and left you to decide what that would be qhorin stood and slid his longsword back into its scabbard when i want a mountain scaled i call on stonesnake should i need to put an arrow through the eye of some foe across a windy battlefield i summon squire dalbridge ebben can make any man give up his secrets to lead men you must know them jon snow i know more of you now than i did this morningand if i had slain her asked jonshe would be dead and i would know you better than i had before but enough talk you ought to be sleeping we have leagues to go and dangers to face you will need your strengthits not important to qhorin whether she lives or dies she just cant come with them but its important to him to know what jon snow would do in a particular situation so that he may lead him effectively jons actions are what allows qhorin to formulate his plan of jon pretending to turn cloak i really dont like the change because youve completely changed the tone of the characters and introduced plot issues when jon finally makes it back to qhorin he will be seen as unreliable he was told to off some chick and instead he disappeared for days doing lord knows what so qhorin will distrust him which is completely opposite of what actually happens in the book so now you need to devote screentime to that conflict and its resolution i cant think of a single valid reason why they would make this changethe problem in a nutshell is that qhorin halfhand would never trust tvjon with his final orders"
"congokong",2012-05-13,"there are a lot of whys this season answer the writers think they can do it better andor their pride keeps them from simply copypatecut grrms work they want to make it their own if that means the show will become tainted in the process well quorin behaved like he just wanted to pick a fight but jon wasnt giving him one and how he said to kill yygritte is just another pointless change"

"Fengari",2012-05-13,"i have no problems with the scene if qhorin really wanted ygritte dead why would he leave it to the newbie and why not just wait a few more minutes to see it is done theres no point in them leaving if it wasnt to give jon the chance to let her go but even if qhorin really wanted her dead and leaving was just a bad move on his part that doesnt have to change the part where he tells jon to infiltrate and kill him after all by that time there really are no other options left they are vastly outnumbered and if they fight they will die the only option then is to have someone yield and infiltrate and who better for that task than the guy who has just spared a wildlings life i think ygritte will still get away maybe she will even be gone by the time jon wakes up after all as a wildling woman how unlikely is it that she has a few knives hidden under all that fur to cut herself loose jon will find his brothers again and the rest will be by the book"
"Buckwheat",2012-05-13,"i think ghost will find them when they are waking up and ygritte will freak out thinking that it is going to eat her and jon jon will be like no problem hes my buddy and shell be like your a warg and hell say get the hell out of here and we will get our first you know nothing jon snowthat would be so cool but i am afraid this is the reason why it will not happen frown5gif classbbcemoticon altfrown5 "

"Buckwheat",2012-05-13,"i agree people have so far prefered to call jon stupid the know nothing bit does get old but it beats stupidwell the way he acts this season and especially the last episode i would call him stupid as well i have been asking myself the whole time er jon what are you doing letting ygritte live and then chasing her tying her in this way that looked ridiculous talking that way to qhorincoming from a fan of bookjon and first seasonjon"
"jarl the climber",2012-05-13,"he behaves with a lot more discretion in the book even letting ygritte free is no big deal they are mounted and she is on foot behind them and unarmed the way it went in the book jon told her he was a snow and that was repulsive to her a cursed name and then he mentions being the bastard of winterfell and she warms up to him and tells him the tale of bael the bard which i hope they dont cut she meets ghost the next morning when the others come up the mountian and she deduces that he is a warg only then does she suggest mance would take him the point is is that in the book he is mostly competent and you can see why they are grooming him for command but they seem to be focusing on him being green and foolish so far"
"SerMixalot",2012-05-13,"green and foolish aye like creating the conflict between he and craster and mormonts disdain for jon completely needless additions to the story that will make jon becoming lc less ratiional"
"King Cheops",2012-05-13,"jon becoming lc was rational no it wasnt tv jon is being set up to show why he fails"

"SerMixalot",2012-05-07,"if they dont have jon going over to the wildings at qhorins orders that will be a huge change his motivations will be far less noble than doing so under orders and i dont think it wouild have taken much effort scriptwise let ygritte go next scene they are surrounded by wildings and qhorin sees the end and gives jon his orders just so they could put some dry humping in there"

"Howland Reed",2012-05-07,"for me danys scenes are almost hard to watch even in the books her chapters just didnt click until my boys strong belwas and the bold got there more so in the 2nd book i barely remember anything of importance happening to her and it seems the same in the show in fact it just annoys me she seems like her brother almost its mine i will take what is mine alright we get it chill out and do something about it instead of going to people and being like im the mother of dragons you will help me i feel like they have strayed kinda far from the book at this point even if they changed only small things it kinda changes the way certain characters can be perceived i feel like jon is a good example him choosing to go with halfhand his whole scene with ygritte he is suppose to let her go and show that he doesnt have the heart to kill this young girl i feel like he is coming off too arrogant in the show just my take maybe not arrogant but some word i cant quite put my tongue on lastly i guess i saw roose bolton a lot differently in my head than in the show i always saw him very melancholy very slow calculated very quiet and confident he seems a bit too normal for me here i dont know just a petpeeve edited by howland reed 08 may 2012  1056 am"

"bardgal",2012-05-07,"so now not only is arya a thief but shes stupid as well what does she expect to do with that note what does she think will happen when tywin finds it missingand jon snow is being set up as a true turncloak thats going to make his whole honor spiel even more annoying the scene with ygritte and qhorin was fine until it turned into a pseudoaction foot chase they could have just let ygritte run off and preserved the integrity of the scene but then bam and why is jon snow running around out there when the halfhand just warned him about unseen dangers like crevassescatelyn is now complicit in robbs snubbing of the freys alright then im not even going to mention the impossible travel speed some characters have attained as well as their ability to find moving campslittlefinger who gave what was essentially a biographical soliloquy about how well he knows people did not recognize arya starkfaceless men are brazen cutthroats and respond to impatience notedthe mistaking of house drommond for marbrand was eye rollworthy amory lorch cant keep marbrand straight from random fake northern house but he doesnt for a second believe that arya might run a note for tywinthe rape scene was gratuitous to an unsettling degree am i watching game of thrones or irreversible it was paired perfectly with a scene of the hound completely eviscerating a man with only a dagger in less than an instanthow did robbs camp get word that ser rodrik died in the same scene that he heard about the fall of winterfellosha slept with theon for literally no reason or gain another sensible logical ta scene under the shows belt she also goes from betraying bran to helping him escape with no explanation as to why bran is able to very clearly articulate osha to the point that ashas name change is confirmed as pointlessarya isnt stupid shes a child who is trying to stay alive in extraordinary circumstances shes also pretty sure shes just been recognized by littlefinger she took it so she could read it i dont think she had a plan after that oh and shes a childi dont see them setting up jon to be a turncloak and its a little early to presume that remember the biggest enemy of the series is lack of time letting her go adds time i think theyre going to skip orell and his eagle too hard to shoot and i dont think they want to mess up kits face so theyre going to have to run back into qhorin another waywhat she tells him to his face youre promised to another how is that being complicit as for travel speed  large moving camps of thousands of soldiers and all their stuff move a lot slower and leave a giant trackable path compared to one dude on a fast horse hey its not as bad as 24 i think its also a way to help tell time passesyou definitely need to rewatch the episode the only reason they wrote him into that scene was to recognize arya there is no other reason for him to be there and staring at her nonstop from the moment tywin said girl and not looking at tywin while he was talking to him almost to the point of hammering us over the head with omg i know who that is helped to clinch it for those actually watching the screenjaqen owes her period if you make light of that her third death owed becomes laughable this way you see he is a man of his word and establishes his commitment to paying his debt to herlorch cant read and a child can shes already made him look bad he wants to known what it says and he cant ask anyone since that would make him look even worse it made the setup to the change of her second death being lorch instead of weese since hes apparently been cut and would have added tons more time to the seriesthe rape scene was perfect considering they had to change the entire scene to be on foot since shooting that with live horses is pretty much impossible without harming someone or an animal they still had to give the hound his go back for the big rescue of sansa moment it was just differentit happens on the same day in the series so im assuming from the same note brought by one ravenosha slept with theon to set up that it would seem she was a turncloak to theons men and would be viewed by all his men as a friendly instead of an enemy that was her plan from the start so she could get them all the hell out of winterfell and it worked the explanation was in the action happening on the screen many americans have hearing problems when it comes to foreign dialects even when everyone speaks english sad fact but true i totally understand the change especially since most everyone from winterfell northward speaks with a yorkshirenorthern dialect which i lovei want to know where the heck the reeds are they seemed pretty important in the books especially jojenyeah  this really bugs me too edited by bardgal 07 may 2012  0119 pm"

"JackSpadegi",2012-05-07,"i believe that in this episode there are some sceneslines that ive been expecting for a long time and others that imo mess up with some characters  first i liked the sansas rescue scene with the hound killing the rapists and his line i didnt do that for you or something similar to tyrion finally we can see something about the sansan biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd   another scene i didnt dislike was daenerys dragons being stolen by pyat pree im quite confident hes the one who took them and that is taking them to the house of the undying its a nice way to deviate from the original plot by not modifying it too much and adding something new to the show without ruining it so far imo it has been one of the few things different from the book that dd have done well  and in the end roose mentioned ramsay droolgif classbbcemoticon altdrool  but beside this  i believe that though charles dances work til this episode has been awesome both tywin and roose acted a bit out of character the first one by smiling way too much and being way too much confident with a cupbearer the second by speaking too loud for a man as the bolton lord  a wildling such as ygritte being caught while running away by a crow who is for the first time behind the wall seriously and i loved the line of qh in which he tells jon that he didnt ordered him to kill ygritte but to do what needed to be done but they cut it and they made jon disobeying qh who this time expicitly wanted him to kill ygritte and i found it quite hilarious and stupid when his blow falls on the rock near ygrittes head he obviously didnt mean to kill her and then when she runs away jon runs after her well quite contradicting isnt it  then about what happened in kl first myrcella crying when she leaves kl while that chapter starts with the girl never wept referred to myrcella then even if i can understand that it would have been too much hard to act with horses during the tumult i believe that the kings men and the people of kl were too much similar and mixed and much more important the chaos that was described in the books wasnt nearly represented in my opinion in the show the crowd wasnt aggressive at all most of them just stood there waving their arms mellowpng classbbcemoticon altmellow "

annoying quote in the showand the way that hbo keeps pumping up that line to make dany look like such a badass is obnoxious if i could i would jump in the show every time she says and get in a cat fight with her shut up lol how are you going to take what is yours with blood and fire in that room with your baby dragons and your tiny khas geezdd quite clearly think they are more clever than grrm if they didnt they wouldnt make such minor changes all of the time ive always feared that they were going to deviate more and more from the show until it was almost unrecognizable and theyre right on their way to that switching around danys story from something boring to stupidwhatever i understand how they have to change around some things to squeeze everything into 10 episodes but changing the minor things is what annoys me most and seems really unnecessary like ygritte pleading for her life tywin talking to his cupbearer like theyre good friends amory lorch just dropping dead in the doorwaywhy plus i wanted to see him get eaten by a big black bear like yoren sadpng classbbcemoticon alt also the books make the show look like disney land especially aryas storyline edited by hk47 07

"congokong",2012-05-07,"i was rocking back and forth this episode yelling no why when they kept unnecessarily changing things and adding plots missing dragons jonygritte getting lost together can we even nitpick anymore the show is changing radically this season why have the writers said last season was very faithful to the books so why has this season gone off into completely new scenesdialogueplots with characters being offed before their time like amory lorch the tickler and sir roderick and then there are the little changes why wasnt it theons idea to take winterfell and now that guy dagmar seems to be calling the shots did he say pay the iron price in reference to killing roderick is that even how the term is used why did quorin declare ygritte had to die also too often in the show has the rationality of the kingsqueens been questioned almost like the thoughts of the audience are being put into the show but the books never had logically fallacies like aegon had no right the throne when he took it being spoken unlike the show im just disappointed this year as the writers egos have grown enormously and they clearly feel they can do a better job than grrm edited by congokong 07 may 2012  0728 pm"

"Pliny",2012-05-07,"to great dayne and othersi would put forward that tywin has his suspicions of arya being high born thus the questions but i doubt he thinks arya is actually a stark he sees her as no threat at all in any real sense but with her dressing as a lad and obviously being sharp of wit and being a natural survivor he likes her he can admire in her certain traits and characteristics that he can relate to cersi isnt clever shes got a shallow mind but shes pretty and thats what she was there for jamie was his perfect boy with whom he had a flaw his apparent dyslexia and metaphorically beat it out of him tyrion is a curse from the gods maybe in his eyes he is an out and out patriarch and as so needs to be a fatherly figure to someone not in a heavy handed way not in a way that he actually cares about the cupgirl but he sees himself as a leader teacher and such and as so he uses this cup girl to full fill his self appointed roleplus he speaks honestly and openly to his cupgirl as a she wouldnt dare tell anyone beveryone needs someone to talk to and its lonely at the topive been getting this impression too the actress playing ygritte is making her more likable than in the books in my opinion but i dont like the setup as others have pointed out it makes jon seem petulant arrogant a turncloak i cant settle on the correct description but i get the feeling that others are feeling the same way its not sitting well with me"

"DragonSpawn",2012-05-08,"i had a mix of love  hate in this episodethe 2nd death where jacquen in the books apparently poisioned the dog to attack its master was replaced by a very potent poison dart  which despite the change i actually loved jacquen is amazing he has a brilliant aura about him it also conveys that arya doesnt put up with nonsense from him which in the books is conveyed in the third death after so much tension it was a nice bit of comic relief so i can see how they have jiggled it around to make it work without having to develop the stories of loads of random sub characters good work dd  that must have been bloody tricky to do littlefinger most definately did not recognise arya  but the tension was brilliant im actually liking tywin more and more coz he keeps being nice to arya and rude to all his own men he still needs to get the fuck of out of harrenhall sharpish thoughwith regards to lf  this interaction definately took place in the books but there was no pov to cover it and it took place while tywin was storming back to kl lf does get about during this time  although i didnt like the interaction with cat previously although maybe its to indicate a softer side to cat which will help the viewer see the difference between her and stoneheart later down the line with tywin and littlefinger sat talking together i really got the impression lf was a lannister for some reason who was that older lannister that disappeared to the free cities in search of the lost lannister valyrian sword the one who never took the game seriously and didnt like living in tywins shadow hhhmmm something for the theories threadsif roose bolton  the bloody mummers dont end up in harrenhall in the next episode i will be very distraught as it will mean they have completely rewritten the story for all characters with the exception of tyrion which is still relatively close to grrms version if they keep adding in joffrey slaps too  i got no problem with that but i wanted to see arya as rooses cupbearer too to get a better feel for his darker side if they can waste so much screen time on irrelevant whores then dd can develop some of the stronger and vastly more significant characters like the bloody mummers and edmure tulley imho roose adds nothing to robbs scenes so why bother keeping him there at all  i just dont see the pointi dont know whats going on with jon snow and ygritte im sure the way its played out is to stop the viewer from badmouthing jon for letting her go easily and then have them get attacked by a bunch of wildlings it could easily be seen as his fault i think it was in the books but maybe onscreen we are missing too much of jons inner thoughts for a viewer to understand he had no choice but my major nitpick with this is that ygritte was way too clean it didnt ring true at allstill no sign of orells deathawk  hellcrow although i thought at one point the sound effect of a hawk circling above could be heard  which may be a nod to it and this brings me to my other key nitpick  the episode title would have been much more fitting for the last episode if you call it the old gods and the new then why leave out jon and ghosts connection orells deathawk  hellcrow all conversations involving quorin explaining that he wants jon along because of his connection with the old gods title probably should have been swapped with the last episodei loved theons scenes  there were changes but they worked really well and i was gritting my teeth before he took off ser rodricks head coz i just knew they were going to make that the messy death that we could have missed out on from the books but going back to the stupid  pointless roose story line changes what a way to drag down robbs character even further sending the bastard of the dreadfort to take back winterfell thats a fuck up they have put on robbs head instead of theons boooo sadpng classbbcemoticon alt major nitpick  danys storyline they left out most of the crossing of the red waste a deeply traumatic and challenging harship that all her followers went though as an act of faith in their khaleesi and the mother of dragons grrm rewards them in the books with some peace and refreshment and a turnaround in fortune when she reaches quarth despite not getting the ships she wants in the end quarth was meant to be the metaphorical cool refreshing pint at the end of a long hard day of travelling an engrossing style of writing that was employed a lot by tolkein dd in some fit of madness left out the full red waste story and then realised there was no payoff in quarth so they rewarded danys followers by completely killing them all off all her handmaids all her dothraki bar a couple of randoms and had her dragons stolen facepalm as for dany getting all desperate and full of herself in her attempt to acquire ships this kinda did happen in the books off screen in various different parts that were summed up in this episode so no issue there  shes still learning to be a queen not a khaleesi  so i expect a few more weird scenes like that from her but the dragons being stolen was a bad move i have heard others say they are sick of the line blood and fire already  me too but i expect that to be used a thousand more times once she gets her dragons back as she cant not be pissed off with quarth for allowing her dragons to be taken i think this is why they made pyatt pree one of the 13  so she would be pissed at them all and not just the warlocks  all in all though  hated the dany scenes dd are being very impatient with stuff happening with her they messed up the red waste and looks like we will pay for it in every dany epsiode till the end of the series now sadpng classbbcemoticon alt  eta ser rodrick died after the letter was sent by

"The Monkey",2012-05-07,"intriguing change i like it it always bothered me in the books how easy it would be for someone to take the dragons preslavers bay yet no one ever did this highlights dany vulnerability and how weak the dragons actually are at this point as instruments of power plus it gives us book viewers something to bite our nails over too edited by the monkey 07 may 2012  0538 am"

"Versiroth",2012-05-07,"i dont think anyone betrayed dany here she goes to the house of the undying in the book and shell also do so in the tv series the difference being that theyve given her a more obvious enemy now in the tv series shell likely find out that they took the dragons shell go there theyll force her to drink the shade of the evening shell she the visions and then the dragons will burn the place down this way is just more dramatic and interesting than the events in the book"
"Ferrum Aeternum",2012-05-07,"i am intrigued by the change but i want to see how it plays out before passing judgment one way or the other depending on the creativity of the resolution this could be a great storyline change or an awful one if the dragon rescue ends up just being all slapdick action sequences i will be very disappointed one things for certain  its given book readers a genuine shock and a mystery to watch unfold which puts us in the same position as nonreaders kinda exciting my personal theory is that xaro has something to do with it and that pyat pree is being set up as a catspaw for the audiences and perhaps danys benefit xxd in the series comes off as a smooth operator but theres plenty more to him than meets the eye he even tells dany that he didnt become the richest man in qarth by following all the rules of polite society edited by ferrum aeternum 07 may 2012  0839 am"

"episodenone",2012-05-07,"bad idea shoulda just started with 1 egg then the 3 heads of the dragon are such an important plot in asoiaf this would be a travesty"
"Greenseer Stark",2012-05-07,"my personal theory is that xaro has something to do with it and that pyat pree is being set up as a catspaw for the audiences and perhaps danys benefit xxd in the series comes off as a smooth operator but theres plenty more to him than meets the eye he even tells dany that he didnt become the richest man in qarth by following all the rules of polite societyi agree with this theory they have changed xaros character quite radically from the books and made him a lot more mysterious i think pyat pree was who we saw at the end of the episode dont like the idea of doreah being the one to steal"
"PatrickStormborn",2012-05-07,"the episode description for next week says that dany receives an invitation to the house of the undying suggesting the warlocks stole her dragons so i really dont see why doreah would be taking the dragons to the house of the undying"
"Roose Seal",2012-05-07,"if we take only what happened in the show its hard to guess who stole the dragons the spice king was mean to her xaro said hed done some nasty things and the previously on showed us pyat at this point it could be any of the three book readers are naturally going to suspect pyat pree because itd make sense either way it was a great move danys storyline in cok was boring as hell up until the hotu"
"scurvy",2012-05-07,"not sure but i have a feeling that the man carrying off the dragons is ser barristan selmy though it would be a rather strange way to reintroduce himi actually think whitebeard will be introduced as helping save her dragons that way they dont need strong belwas"
"David Selig",2012-05-07,"doreah betraying dany would really come out of left field there have been no hints of it at all in the previous episodes i think its more probable she was away on some other business most likely seducing men for information as mentioned in the previous episodes i hope so at least she has to remain with dany for a long time otherwise it would be a damn shame they already killed irri off it would be too much if they get rid of both of them and leave only jorah as the only developed character near dany"
"Roose Seal",2012-05-07,"if you look closely at the end you can very very briefly see a small part of the persons face and it looked pale waxy and wrinkled if only there was someone of that complexion who could want to lure dany into something  hmmm"
"A Stark in Salem",2012-05-07,"sorry to disagree but i personally hated this change from start to finishfor one who got past her badass dothraki guards this city is supposed to be more nearly a wealthy dying corpse that the vibrant and fresh way they are showing it in the books its made point that the soldiers are effeminate and seem more for show than anything else their primary defense is the endless desert on the one side and sea on the other but this scene make her remaining soldiers seem ineffectual and further her dragons no more dangerous than three cats in a cagehowd the thief manage to pull them out and put them in his back pack cage anyway they only respond to dany and would fight anyone who showed up to steal them especially with a lot of violence and noise preceding it yes they are vulnerable to being killed but thats not the same at all to not being able to fry someones face when they opened up their cages not to mention those nasty looking claws and teethoverall i loved the episode right up to that scene at which point i wanted to scream at the writers i expect it will all end up at the same basic ending but why not skip this little scene altogether and give some more time to another plot line she certainly doesnt get equal time in the books at least not this one no reason to have to invent stuff to keep viewers connected imo"

"Lord Petyr Baelish",2012-05-07,"its a welcomed plot change i like some of the changes the show has made so far they stay true to the books while adding in scenes that can keep the plot more intriguing this change will evoke more emotion from danys characteri love seeing her angry so hot and hopefully make the house of the undying more interesting then it was portrayed in the book"

"PatrickStormborn",2012-05-07,"in the book she is invited to the hotu iirc goes through it and then is rescued by drogon as the visions get too intense again iirc in the meantime destroying the hotu nope the warlocks try to kill her so drogon burns them"
"Ferrum Aeternum",2012-05-07,"tv xaro is too perfect and they need to make some way for things to go sour between him and dany in the book he wants her to forget about the seven kingdoms and sail away on a pleasure barg with him forgetting about everything she is fighting for and entering a loveless marriage in the show he is offering her ships his vast wealth and pretty much anything she would need to conquer the seven kingdoms it would be odd if she didnt consider his proposal even though jorah told her to make her own way xaro has given her a very sweet deal that show viewers wouldnt understand why she would pass it up i know my fiance said she marries him rightexactly his offer is simply too good to be true and he is too charming besides the seeds of this idea for me began when he vouched for her at the gates of qarth in episode 4  where perhaps the other members of the thirteen saw dany as a charlatan or an inconvenience he saw an opportunity and a risk worth taking why for the promise of power offered by the dragons showxaro appears to have a bit of a chip on his shoulder hes now referenced his humble beginnings at least once in each episode and its implied from the spice kings verbal barbs that xxd isnt exactly respected amongst his peers in the thirteen perhaps xaro wants to change the order of things in qarth and feels danys dragons are the key to doing so as you point out there was no good reason for dany to turn his marriage proposal down in the first place but once she did its plain that a man in his position would not be above resorting to a more ruthless measure to achieve his goal also xaro takes her to the spice king and has her waiting a very long  something he could have set up to keep her gone longer the are in his home and it seems strange that richest man in qarth would have a place that could be broken into so easily if danys people saw xaros people coming they would have been caught off guard at first because they trust them we know xaro really wanted a dragon in the books and he tells dany hes done a lot of shady stuff to get to where hes at so i wouldnt put it past him to steal the dragons the warlocks can do some magic tricks but are they good warriors could they have killed so many of danys people that easily i dont think soall excellent points that only serve to reinforce this theoryi could see xaro blaming it on the warlocks and dany going to the house of the undying and learning the truthyep  the warlocks are an easy scapegoat if pree is any indication they are weird creepy and very interested in the dragons its natural that folks would assume they would be behind the theft just seems a bit too obvious to me and as you mentioned before they arent exactly known for their martial prowess"
"Blangadanger",2012-05-07,"danys story has kept me on my toes this season because clearly dd are taking much more liberty with her story from the books than the other characters in the series part of me is frustrated that they choose to change things from the books but i have to say its still very well done im actually liking danys story a lot so far certainly more so than i did from reading the acok the spice king and xaro both have been very intriguing characters to watch and i like that theyve already focused on the tension between jorah and dany early im kind of hoping that all three of the guys mentioned pyat xaro spicegrammar king are involved with the abduction of the dragons it will be interesting to see dany struggling with the turmoil of losing her dragons in the house of undying and if they all are seen in her visions as enemies it will make her inevitable angry blowup much more exciting"

"zep243",2012-05-08,"several posters mentioned xaro being involved in the theft i dont believe this could be the case as it seemed a lot of his household guard andor servants were brutally slaughtered why would he kill his own men if xaro was involved he could have made it look like a sneaky theft with only a couple of danys people killed after rewatching i only saw one dothraki body in addition to irri i do like the idea that doreah was off playing with drogon so one dragon is still safethat would be a good twist personally i think this change has potential if it was committed by the warlocks it gives dany a reason to go to the hotu in the books i thought it was a desperate stupid decision for dany to enter the temple but she was only 15 or 16 by this point in the books and pretty pigheaded so it made sense i think that the writers of the show believe that a 20 yr old dany might be more reluctant to put herself and drogon at risk so she needed a stronger motivation to go the the hotu this is also the same reason i believe for the slightly contrived subplot of arya needing to waste her second wish on lorch it is not believable that this 14 yr old street smart quick thinking girl would be dumb enough to waste a death wish on a very childish personal vendetta like killing her book tormentor wease only after tywin left did she realize that she wasted her 2nd wish i think tv show arya would have used wishes 2 and 3 on the mountain and tywin the writers needed a believable way to force her hand all these child characters are older than the book counterparts by significant amounts that makes their motivations and subsequent actions much different than they were in the book rob needs more than just puppy love to break his vows he needs a strong confident woman not a virginal demure young girl who nurses his booboo sansa needs to lose her delusions faster jon needsdry rubbing smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  sorry for the long post"

"BabyMeraxes",2012-05-08,"add me to the list of people who think xxds got a role in this hes probably pissed that dany denined him also there are three dragons so the undying are probably thinking they can throw xaro a bone and give him the gold ive had 0 problems with the changes theyve made this one in particular being super awesome it makes the house of the undying seem that much more treacherous and creepy it also helps to highlight that danys dragons are like children theyre young and vulnerable and need her for protection even when reading the series i viewed danys dragons as companions more so than weapons that being said i hope that tantrum dany threw at the spice kings is the last empty threat well see from her dany is compotent and while young in the books she seemed to have some grasp on how to play the game in qarth"

"victim",2012-05-07,"im not sold on ramsayreek being completely cut out we know he wont be appearing directly but i can see him being mentioned to the point where nonreaders will know who and what he is without ever seeing him like stannis in season 1whether robb asks roose to retake winterfell or not remains to be seen im unsure what evidence there is on this i can however see a change coming where robb asks him to do this and perhaps roose declares that harrenhal is more important leaving winterfell to be retaken by his bastard son who is again only mentioned later on we would see theon being overwhelmed and winterfell being sacked by an unnamed bolton force which the audience can only assume is being led by the bastard of bolton even nonreaders should find this compelling and it also doesnt immediately out roose as a villain and stays true to the books in that way at least i understand quoting yourself is damn lame but it seems i was actually correct and i want to parade that fact around"

"A<U+0089>tA©",2012-05-07,"i reckon dagmer is going to turn out to be ramsay reeks most important contribution to theons story is as the devil on his shoulder and dagmer has already stepped into that role it would take away the cruel rolereversal of theons ultimate humiliation but i dont think theres enough time to establish a repulsive reek character before the hunt roose could have had him follow theon to pyke to spy on the notoriously untrustworthy greyjoys in case they pulled something or summat along those lines not fantastic storytelling but it would simplify things"

"Buttered Turnip",2012-05-07,"why would they be in the crypts stillwhen they just escaped winterfell this previous episode winterfell is in their rear view alreadyi may be wrong but isnt this what happens in the books i thought they escaped then backtracked to winterfell thats why theon was able to track them into the woods but eventually lost their tracks"

"Francis Buck",2012-05-07,"yeah i dont know why people are so bent on dagmer being ramsay it makes no sense what did ramsay just infiltrate the ironborn when he was a kid or something and as others have said hes too old to be rooses son not to mention his appearancemannerisms are totally different from how ramsay is described i think its obvious that they just didnt bother to cast ramsay this season because they didnt need to exactly the same as how they didnt cast jaqen last season and instead they just had a dude in a hood the same kind of thing is probably going to happen here the only other option i can see is that they cast someone relatively popular or famous and are trying to keep it a secret until the end of the season though i think this greatly unlikely"

"Magic 8 Ball",2012-05-07,"during episode 5 cleftjaw set off the reek radar in my head big time ive now accepted this isnt the case this is just a result of the schematics of producing a television show in increments over time casting an actor to play reek would take money the relatively minor role this season followed by larger roles in future seasons runs the risk of not being able to retain the actor and to get a bigger name they would have to pay big money for an actor to appear in less than 20 minutes of screen time this year it was only practical to forestall ramsays introduction to next season however to leave open theons character for sympathy and redemption you have to have someone manipulating him into his most irredeemable acts they cast cleftjaw so he is taking that role and because he is goading theon into his most evil acts he seems like reek to book readers the way for the show to take advantage of this angle is to have the audience suckered into cheering for reek initially as a protagonist  yay hes working for robb stark and taking out the evil theon greyjoy get the audience to savor theons downfall then gradually turn their stomachs as they realize just what ramsay truly represents play with their expectations and emotions introduce more gray into the series etc"

"HyacinthGirl",2012-05-08,"i really think dagmer  ramsay snow yeah theorys got some holes in it but think about it weve had no confimration that dagmer is in fact ironborn we havent seen him interacting with any of his fellow iron islanders hes taken the role of the devil on theons shoulder which is exactly what reek does in the book at this point roose knew theon was being sent back to pyke and could have sent word to his bastard to follow him and keep an eye on things roose may not have known the greyjoys would rise against the starks but was aware of the possibility roose may say his bastards in the dreadfort but we all know just how trustworthy roose is someone pointed out that the actor of dagmer is older than the actor of roose but he doesnt look too much older they could get away with it dagmer has been given way too much screen time to just be randomly killed when the bastard of bolton arrives hes gotta have some wider significance edited by hyacinthgirl 15 may 2012  0512 am"
"Jamie Lannister",2012-05-08,"well the fact remains that dagmers actor is older than rooses that alone is the red light for me it would be awkward as hell to see them interactramsays presumably in his twenties no age is ever really given but hes described as a young man and almost certainly not a teen why age him up with an actor older than the guy playing his father tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp  edited by jamie lannister 08 may 2012  0539 am"

"IVI4RCU5",2012-05-08,"for all the people arguing that hbo is not going to show theon being flayed at the dreadfort go watch season 3 of dexter theres a villain called the skinner in that season and you see people both living and dead who have been wholly or partially flayed i believe you even see the dead body of a teenage boy who has been flayed so i dont think hbo showing us theons transformation into reek losing his fingers etc is out of the question at all for reasons of graphicness its been done before and as far as i know there was no outcry or anything they will probably cut away from the actual act of flaying but thats easily done they could even just focus in on ramsays sick grin as hes doing it while theon screams it will turn heads to be sure but really we want ramsay to turn heads all in all i think theres enough material in that storyline for theon to have about as much material in season 3 and 4 as jaime is getting this season we can get a scene of insert show replacement for kyra here freeing theon and them going on the run only to be hunted down by ramsay and his dogs at which point its revealed it was all ramsays sick game then ramsay doling out his punishment to them both would be affecting as hell and perfect to set ramsay up to take joffreys place as the shows prime sadistic sociopath we could also conceivably have the lady hornwood subplot play out after theons a captive at the dreadfort edit the castration will i hope still be impliedalthough spartacus blood and sand showed even thati dont much care for that show edited by ivi4rcu5 08 may 2012  0656 am"

"Arkash",2012-05-08,"the series will never do flashbacks too cheasy and out of tune and the obvious choice to introduce the fanslong awaited ramsay and keep contract with alfie allen is to show those scenes in next season and it will be a good thing it will be amazing on screen and create another villain to take the place of joffrey"

"IVI4RCU5",2012-05-10,"bolton said to theon that stark were done when he take winderfelli do remember him saying this but it doesnt necessarily mean thats when he decided to switch sides it would make sense thoughsomething seems to be off on the timeline for ramsey roose robbin the show robb has been nothing but successful in his war he has not betrayed the freys is roose already plotting to betray him does he have that much control over his bastard i figured that roose had only decided to betray robb between finding he has married and the rw cant recall how does that timeline work with ramsey capturing winterfellwell even though we dont find out about robbs marriage until catelyn does in book 3 he got married sometime during the events of book 2 so its not impossible that roose got word of this while at harrenhal through some other source and sent word to ramsay at the dreadfort after hed been sent away by theon to get help giving him the goahead to sack winterfell however i find this to be unlikely as it seems to imply a rather detailed knowledge by roose of events both in the west and in the north i think its far more likely that ramsay simply acted independently considering the starks were already willing to kill him after the lady hornwood incident he was left as castellan of the dreadfort by roose if im not mistaken so whatever men were there owed him their loyalty in rooses absence and wouldve had to obey his commandsedit also i challenge anyone to tell me that this isnt ramsay boltonhttp29mediatumbbxpzko1400png edited by ivi4rcu5 10 may 2012  0416 pm"

"Fengari",2012-05-12,"httpwinteriscomineeramsaysnowsecond paragraph sounds promising enough but ehi guess that makes it clear we should not expect reek in winterfell anymore if they already had someone for the part of reekramsay they wouldnt need to cast him for next season with dagmer being the devil on theons shoulder we dont really need him though it was a great detail in the book theon being betrayed by the man he released from the winterfell prison it was just that a detail i also dont think we need to see or hear from the original reek whats important about ramsay turning theon into reek is the utter humiliation and breaking of the mans spirit not that he is a replacement to some obscure servant he had beforeso what is rooses plan in sending ramsay to winterfell anyway is he already planning to betray the starks in the showi think he is seizing the opportunity to strengthen the boltons in the north having his bastard control winterfell and both stark heirs puts the boltons in a very strong position if anything should happen to robb after all they are at war and anything can happen to robb even if he isnt actively planning to have a hand in his downfall yetsince ramsay seems to be working for roose now my guess is thisnext episode is when he tracks down the boys and kills the millers kids im guessing the show will give us the cliffhanger of theon stringing up two boys and some of the winterfell staff wailing in horrorin the prince of winterfell yaraasha comes to visit drops off a few men yells at theon for being a moron for killing the boys then leaves robb  cat get the news of bran  rickons death twitter explodes with the controversy of killing children especially a handicapped onein episode 10 ramsays forces attack winterfell and overwhelm the 30 or so men with theon well see some of the initial attack and then theyll cut away to theons final scene with wintefell burning around him and theon being slapped to the ground by ramsay people will be cheering for ramsay theyll then have roose reporting to robb that ramsay has retaken winterfell but theon burned most of the structures to the ground when he saw he was losing alas all inside were lost save theon who is now a prisonerthen episode 10 closes with bran  rickon escaping winterfell with hodor and oshacould be but as i have said somewhere else on these boards i wouldnt be surprised if the sack of winterfell and the resurfacing of bran and rickon is pushed to season 3 having people believe the boys are dead and winterfell is about to be saved by the son of roose at the end of this season and then opening the next with winterfell burning and the boys coming out of the crypts would make for an opening episode that nobody would soon forgetso my guessep 7 theon leads a search partyhunting the boys killing the millers sons or in this case the orphan boys sent to the farmer earlierep 8 at winterfell theon receives a visitor and holds down the fortyara shows up with a ridiculous small amount of support tries to convince theon to leave winterfell theon refusesep 10 as theon stirs his men to action luwin offers some final advicethe bolton men show up beneath the walls of winterfell luwin advises theon to yield and take the black making it clear that there is no way he can hold the castle with so few men no need to show ramsay except maybe as a guy in red armor seen from afarone thing that makes me wonder the whole roose goes north theory was here not only because of the absence of reek but also to explain why roose wasnt at harrenhall so now we now for sure roose isnt going north the question that remains unanswered is why is roose not at harrenhall"
"Pellaeon",2012-05-12,"one thing that makes me wonder the whole roose goes north theory was here not only because of the absence of reek but also to explain why roose wasnt at harrenhall so now we now for sure roose isnt going north the question that remains unanswered is why is roose not at harrenhallroose will take harrenhal after tywin went to the battle at the blackwater and during this attack arya will escape because roose will sack the castle so roose is in harrenhalin season 3 or not at all and arya escape because the mountain take over the castle after tywin leaves"
"Ramsay Gimp",2012-05-08,"at the end we see roose suggest to his his king that rather than head north with his army he should allow rooses bastard to deal with theon and retake winterfell in acok it seems to me that roose didnt decide to betray the starks until after a bran and rickon were killed and b stannis lost at the blackwater it is after these pivotal events that he sends the infantry to duskendale but before he gets word of robb breaking his oath to the freys which he must have seen as yet another reason to turn cloak but in the show bran and rickon are not considered dead yet and stannis is still very much in the game the lannisters are on the run as he says himself so what is he planning by sending ramsay has tv roose changed allegiance before book roose and wants ramsay to sack the castle kill the princes and blame it on theon or is he being sincere at this point and not realizing what ramsay is going to do"
"Milcov",2012-05-09,"quite a lot of people speculate that as soon as robb lost winterfell he lost roose robbs hope was sort of with renly stannis and joff will both kill him balon would as well if robb shows no intention of seizing the iron throne and all the other claimants would delight or see it as vital to kill him then it wont be good for the boltons when they lose roose is aware that the odds arent on his side and thats all he needs to know"

"Eddard Sand",2012-05-09,"i think at this point rooses plan is to take winterfell to curry favor with his liege lord when events turn for the worse he does what any good power hungry lord would do i cant recall exactly what happens in the books does ramsay raze winterfell at rooses request or on his own"
"scurvy",2012-05-09,"its not clear the roose wants ramsay in the books he seems to hedge a little he wants an heir by his frey bride and knows ramsay is a threat to that heir he seems to recognized ramsay has his uses but the clock may be running out he also knows that ramsay killed his first true heir who died of what i remember to be a bad belly"

"RobertOfTheHouseBaratheon",2012-05-10,"roose in the books is constantly hedging his bets he speaks to robb of his bastard as if he didnt care whether he was killed and he probably didnt hes just trying to spread his eggs about so that hes in a good position no matter if the tide turns against robb or stays with him if stannis wins and robb continues to do well in the war roose will be the man who saved winterfell and resecured the north for robb if things go sour for robb and he does the dirty as the possessor of winterfell  the north and as he isnt a stark he could trade submission for a favourable deal with the iron throne it will be later events blackwater tyrell alleigance that will seal which way the wind is blowing for him and lead him to get ground level into the conspiracy to gain even beter terms with the iron throne i think theon will kill the millers boys before ramsey arrives and episode 10 well see ramsey attack and retake winterfell without seeing his face as hell be an extra then next season ramseys will start by torturing theon in winterfell and his burning of winterfell will tie in closer timelinewise to his fathers betrayal of robb at the rw"

"Honey Badger",2012-05-11,"i always thought around the time robb executed his cousin karstark that bolton decided to turn robb was turning out to be his fathers son and while catelyn was proud of that roose figured idiotic stark honor was what killed ned so decided to move against him but the timing has to work as i figured tywin and roose negotiated for some time before deciding on the red wedding it probably happened before the westerling incident when robb lost the freys after losing the karstarks as for taking over the north i think thats too bold of a master plan more like the opportunity was there so he took it otherwise hed be happy to be robbs bannerman or tywins bannerman depending on how the winds blew so long as hes in a better position tomorrow than he is today and he survives its all good to him in that sense frey and bolton are the same type of house except that freys are open with their disdain and lack of loyalty while boltons are much more clever pretending to be loyal"

"House Snow",2012-05-07,"i think alfie is making this season in my opinion he is doing a fantastic jobi couldnt agree more i dont think i appreciated just central his character was going to be in making this season but if he had been off or even the more like george wrote him i dont think the season would have been nearly as good alfie is really taking advantage of his opportunityalso it will be interesting when the emmy noms come out the show apparently submitted tyrion and theon for supporting actor imo theon deserves it more than tyrion so far edited by house snow 07 may 2012  0717 pm"

"Honey Badger",2012-05-07,"i think tv theon is much more successful than the books at showing the characters humanity in the books hes such a dick that its harder to feel bad for him here you really see how conflicted and damned he is hes never going to be happy i wonder if theres any redemption for him before the series is over"

"snax",2012-05-08,"alfie played theon quite pathetically this episode this is a good thing it is obvious to everyone there that he is nothing more than a pretender of a noble princeling i think knowing his inner turmoils sets him up to be more of a tragic character than in the books for when he becomes reek instead of merely a traitorous jerk getting his just desserts"

"Queen Regent",2012-05-08,"actually that whole scene was amazing not just theon was great but also roderick and bran i think isaac hempstead wright did a really good job at completely freaking out sometimes when people go hysterical it can be over the top but he did it perfectlyi agree he bran was perfect and theon having to hack the head off a few times then kick it that was awful"
"Envie",2012-05-08,"im also in the camp that pities theon more than hates him yes he made some terrible and really stupid choices but as theyve tried to portray him in the show hes pathetic because he has been torn between two worlds most of his life never fitting in either place now that hes an adult and forced to choose one that didnt even want him over the other that had treated him well but still was never his familyhonestly theons story is more what jon snows story could have been if ned stark hadnt been loving and allowed the boy to be treated with the same respect as all the stark children by everyone else except catelyn of coursethere is no greater human social torture than being an outcast truly its one of the most defining traits of all creatures who have feelings and need for love animals that are driven off from their families or rejected by their social groups usually become psychotic and die or grow violent and unpredictable if they continue to survive martin played up this theme well in the book but only a great actor can bring it to life and really make you feel for the character despite his horrible actions thats what alfie is doing with perfectioni think people hating theon are misplacing their feelings"

"pntrlqst",2012-05-10,"its imperative they cast them because catelyn will need much to do early next season if the audience is to be further invested in her and her eventual fate i hope she immediately flees to riverrun following her release of jamie so she isnt around to see robb make the biggest mistake of his life catelyn with her father will be a good emotional scene edmure is imperative even with the changes theyve made these guys arent stupid enough to eff around with the best story line in the series edited by vntrlqst 10 may 2012  0813 pm"

"Laohu",2012-05-07,"this little phrase delivered by daenerys to the spice king piqued my curiosity enough to make a thread for its discussion and i hope some of you are interested enough to join i have a few questions regarding it foremost of which is whether it coincides with book canon if memory serves it does not regardless i want to hear read your thoughts on the matter assuming this is a change from the books what butterfly effect can we expect from it are we going to see dany dream in the future will this have some effect on her visit to the hotu does she not drink some dreaminducing concoction before she stepped foot inside maybe this line in episode 6 was created to lay some groundwork for a dip into uncharted territory for the series  dreams and prophecy  then again perhaps i am making a huge deal out of a comment that was only meant to be part of a passionate plea for trust and support"
"FloredaA",2012-05-10,"i dont think she meant it literally as in what she dreams when sleeping in the books or the show shes never mentioned or shown as having seer dreams like bran for example but she does have some almostmystical or genious inspirations like how to make the dragon eggs hatch in the show its shown as those trancelike moments like when she looks at the eggs and puts one on live coals or when viserys gets his crown i think we can understand my dreams as in my visions and yes its probably groundwork for her visions in the hotu its been noted before that the show writers often need to bring close together in two or three episodes themes or clues that are scattered through several books a lot of the nonbook scenes are actually invented for that purpose like probably that otherwise pointless discussion between the spice king and daenerys edited by floredaa 10 may 2012  0241 am"
"Envie",2012-05-10,"i also wondered if they had added this emphasis on dreams coming true to lay some groundwork for the prophecies and visions dany will have in the house of the undying now that theyve changed it up to have the dragons kidnapped and taken there we can be pretty sure theres going to be a big dramatic conclusion there and her passionate speech about dreams coming true especially emphasis on fire and blood again is surely a setup"
"RobertOfTheHouseBaratheon",2012-05-10,"i think most of the prophecies and visions in the hotud are going to be cut they may mention the aa prophecy but most of it wouldnt work in a tv series for example rhaegar dying and saying a womens name we cant hear the words lyanna as grrm went out of his way to make sure we didnt read the name lyanna the rw forshadowing as well i think will be too blatent its one thing reading a list of prophecies but seeing a table of dead men at a feast with a wolf headed king would forshadow too much i think also the back story with the red door dany hasnt mentioned as we cant get in her head so that would be out of place the mummurs dragon bit is a bit too insignificant at this point itll only be relevant in series 56 and ive never seen any tv series forshadow that far ahead same goes for the victarion forshadowing they need to mention tptwp and three heads has the dragon they might show westeros being raped but aside from that i cant really remember anything they would have to show"

"Bastard of Boston",2012-05-10,"i think it was intended as more of a threat than dany declaring herself a prophet to say my dreams come true is almost like saying i get what i want and if what she wants is to conquer westeros and make qarth pay for turning her away its as if shes saying the spice king will pay for patronizing her but it is a statement with doublemeaning i dont believe dany thinks herself a prophet but leading everyone else to believe she is based on her experience with the dragons doesnt hurt her"
"KC_Accidental",2012-05-10,"hi there first poster but have been browsing the forum a while please forgive me if this has already been discussed the absence of the tullys mainly edmure and the blackfish is something i can easily understand for the show but something i didnt think about at first but seems to obvious now is that if the tullys do not feature at all then how will a certain event next series take place i think you all know which one so i shouldnt need to say it if it wasnt for that one key event i would think the tullys expendable as characters because apart from that they are not really important to the overall plot they fill minor roles and are somewhat interesting but overall not that important i do hope though that they make an appearance next season along with other characters cut from this season that we expect like ramsey jojen and meera however if the shows cuts them out completely then how will rw take place marry off on of robbs underlings surely whoever it would be would have to have some blood connection to robb which leaves only cat and id hate to see them go down that road personally i expect to see them introduced next season so im not giving it too much thought"

"Envie",2012-05-07,"i think they added this embellishment to spice up danys story a bit which we all agree got a little stale in cok and doesnt really translate as well onto film sure she could have just been invited to the house of the undying without any drama involved but that means most all of her scenes for this season fall short of any sort of excitement which keeps viewers guessing and curious for the next chapter"

"Fengari",2012-05-08,"i was totally in shock after seeing this episode after the scene with arya where is that incredibly smart girl i loved a totally new storyline just before watching i had a talk with my husband about tvmovie adaptations and about how it is sometimes necessary to cut pieces of the story to make it feasible after defending dd for cutting some parts of the story how could they have invented a totally new storyline in fact replacing the ones they cut and making my arguments of theres just no time for it sound silly ive calmed down a bit now and i understand that choice a little more dany has become one of the most loved characters during the first season her storyline in cok however isnt that eventful so the choices they had were show less of her show boring scenes or invent something exciting for her showing less of her would mean a lot of people would think the show showed too little of her showing boring scenes just isnt a very good option for a show depending on ratings so they went with the third option i think i personally would have preferred the first one and a little more time for arya or bran but i understand the choice i guess it all comes down to this if we bookreaders want to enjoy this series fully i think we will have to break it loose from the books accept that things may be different and judge the series on its own merits the acting the photography the storylines of the series do they work yes they do so ive decided that as long as the characters move in the same general direction as they do in the books im not going to fret about a few shortcuts or deviations lets say it makes the series more exciting knowing you dont know everything already edited by fengari 08 may 2012  0725 am"

"WolveseatDragons",2012-05-07,"so there is one glaring gap that seems to have been overlooked with sir rodrick he left winterfell with 200 men in the show 600 in the books and the whole reason that theon is able to take winterfell is he gets around them then suddenly he just ends up captured by himself wtf what about the 200 men he had with him that would have easily overwhelmed the handful that theon had then it is also mentioned in the message to robb that rodrick was killed but how could that have been known since luwin sent the raven before it happened very clumsy writing"
"Crown",2012-05-07,"luwin was ordered to send more ravens after rodriks death"
"SerMixalot",2012-05-07,"to tell the world he killed ser rodrik why"
"Arkash",2012-05-07,"luwin didnt tell theon what he put in those messages"
"Don't_call_me_Ser",2012-05-07,"got to agree that im confused as to where all the men have gone theon could easily have ordered word to be sent to the other local towns of rodericks death as a warning of dont try anything were hard look what we did sort of thing but the missing men is a puzzle"
"Robb_",2012-05-07,"they said he was caught coming back from torrhens square the guess would be that he and his 200 men lost the battle and the few that survived were ambushedkilled on the way back"
"SynthFG",2012-05-07,"well hes taking the part of ser benifer and his wild hares at a guess he left most of his 200 at torens square chasing down raiders and was returning with a small party to winterfel when he was ambushed"
"bloodymime",2012-05-07,"perhaps he left the men at torrhens square to reinforce it why go to the trouble of taking it back just to leave it undefended again"
"tfoxx22",2012-05-07,"i noticed this too but even if rodrik was only returning with a handful of men i believe but may be wrong that theon only had one ship of men and clearly most of them were in winterfell when rodrik was captured so i feel like it would have been pretty difficult to capture him other than that i really liked the scene and thought it was pretty well done"
"Envie",2012-05-07,"i think overlooking the fact rodrik had 200 men is easier for me than the dramatic change they made in having theon hack his head off im still coping with that gut wrenching stunner myself overall im ok with the change but man its getting hard to keep everything straight"
"Monk Meth-",2012-05-07,"made rodrick look like a lesser man"
"Moose2949",2012-05-07,"in the book theon had 8 ships but in the series he had just 1 ship just a guess but i would say he had about 5080 men at the most with that one ship which is enough to threaten torrhens square and then slip by and snag winterfell but hardly enough to take out a few hundred men who know they are there in the scene in episode 205 where ser rodrik asks for men to help ts they pretty much spell out that he is picking winterfell clean which is obvious from the dialogue in the scene itself and the fact that theon took winterfell with a handful of men doesnt it seem logical that ser rodrik would bring some of those men back if he destroyed the ironmen at ts then he would assume there was no threat or a minimal threat left and take men back maybe he would leave a small number at ts and take the rest back to winterfell if he got there and they slipped away there would be ironmen on the loose and he would prolly bring some men w him back to winterfell either way you cut it with a war raging and an obvious threat to the north and winterfell i doubt a seasoned commanderknight would be travelling without an escourt just my 2c"
"Magjee",2012-05-07,"i was surprised they didnt drown him as a sacrifice"
"Honey Badger",2012-05-08,"i think if they kept the tone of the books then rodrick was caught unawares and overwhelmed in cases of trickery the numbers arent going to matter plus you could easily write that they were spread thin while theon had the benefit of surprise keeping a wedge and hitandrun tactics the books did have it that theon wont be reinforced by asha and the northerners were rallying to retake winterfell it wasnt until the bastard bashed his face in that all his plans went awry i liked the way rodrick went down calling theon a traitor and a coward how ugly his execution was bran crying everything well done then suddenly he just ends up captured by himself wtf what about the 200 men he had with him that would have easily overwhelmed the handful that theon had then it is also mentioned in the message to robb that rodrick was killed but how could that have been known since luwin sent the raven before it happenedif theon was able to surprise rodrick and catch him in a compromising position then the numbers dont matter if you get the enemy to rout first then 1000 can easily beat back 3000 or in this case 3050 could beat 200 so long as theons play struck hard enough then rodricks men were reasonably scattered for the ravens luwin was ordered to send out birds to announce prince theons ascension he could have mentioned cassels death then"

"Fez",2012-05-08,"my fanwank is that they got to torrens square and didnt see any enemy there and so rodrik sent his men back to the fields for the harvest winter is coming after all and he went back to winterfellwith a handful of fulltime guards"

"Envie",2012-05-07,"i agree that rickons part in the story still remains a mystery but martin wouldnt write it in that hes taken away to skagos by osha if there was no reason for him to be alive anymore it would make no sense for the producers to have rickon killed off if in fact he does play an important role later on in the books we havent yet read im with most others who think the reeds are going to make a belated appearance in season 3 theyll meet up along the road somewhere having been sent by their dad when he found out winterfell was taken but before theon has done the switch out with the millers sons after being unable to find bran and rickons trail of escape"
"Terminated",2012-05-08,"as i mentioned before the simplest way for the series is to have osha lead bran to coldhand at the wall leave bran with him it and go to most likely skaagos with rickon i dont need jojen in the show i dont like that character too much it just doesnt fit for me"

"Bearsblood8",2012-05-08,"why do they need to meet the reeds osha has already explained away almost their entire purpose for brani think the problem we run into is that we dont know how important oshas role in skagos is if d  d place her with bran and bloodraven who fills her role with rickon its likely that her knowledge of wildlings and the north was essential to rickons staying alive on skagos"
"White Harbors Wrath",2012-05-08,"im absolutely sure she is crucial to his survival there theres no reason for her to go with bran past the wall they split there sam is perfectly capable of getting bran and hodor through the wall and into coldhands escort while osha and rickon say their goodbyes and go on to skagos no need for luwin to live no need for the reeds i love brans portion of the story in the booksbut as crowded as this story is going to get with greyjoys and martells dany finally getting stuff to do besides yell about taking stuff once an episode wildlings stannis battles at the wall red wedding jaime and brienne and on and on and ondo we really want them wasting huge chunks of the season on the same for the most part redundant buildup of bran getting to his destination and being cold with the reeds theres way more entertaining things to be focusing on for a tv series w limited time and a soon to come explosion of new characters"

"Vuron",2012-05-08,"there is no need to include the reeds unless they have some important role to play after adwd bran is already having the green dreams and osha knows what they are so that leaves out jojen meera was mainly for exposition the reeds told us about the toj green men island of faces knight of the laughing tree and some history the show has already skipped the toj and there is no reason to drop all the other hints during one scene in season 2 tv doesnt work the same way as books you cant discuss something in one scene during season 2 planning to reveal the outcome in season 8 if weve learned anything from the arya storyline its that journeys can be severely contracted arya went from leaving kl one scene in the wilderness with the gold cloaks the fight with lorchs men and then straight to harrenhall even though we were introduced to hot pie and lommy we never learned any of their back story and non readers barely know who they are bran could make it to bloodraven in 4 scenes leave winterfell and head to the wall meet sam at wall meet coldhands go from wall to bloodraven no need for the reeds even if the reeds are included i think people are going to be severely disappointed when we dont get all their stories and we dont learn any of their history just like hot pie and lommy it makes the most sense to keep osha with rickon and let hodor and bran travel alone until they meet samcoldhandsbloodraven theyve set it up so that osha doesnt want to go back north and i dont think she will bran and rickon could easily split up as they leave winterfell the only thing that i question is how much the show runners like osha and will we see many made up scenes with her and rickon over the next few seasons edited by vuron 08 may 2012  1137 am"

"snowzombie",2012-05-07,"anyone notice how half of the episodes that have been aired this season are named after something that has no bearing on the action in the episode episode 1 the north remembers that phrase comes from dance with dragons and the longsimmering desire to avenge ned and the red wedding we check in with robb and his side of the war the main action is him sending theon to treat with his father and him sending catelyn to treat with renly there is no emphasis on vengeance episode 2 the nightlands it wasnt until last night someone made mention of drogo riding in the nightlands was this supposed to make us aware of how close dany was to dying in this episode i dont think they successfully made a connection episode 3 what is dead may never die this made sense because the words were spoken by theon at his baptism episode 4 garden of bones jorah mentions this phrase talking about the fate of travelers who arent allowed into quarth episode 5 the ghost in harrenhal this was nice because we knew to expect jaqen episode 6 the old gods and the new this was said in the scene with brienne and catelyn in last weeks episode i guess they wanted to use that as a title but didnt want to move that scene into this weeks episode speculation episode 7 a man without honor from the episode guide it looks like this is when jaime will make his escape attempt also theon leads a search party meaning he might murder his proxy stark children and further provoke the people left in winterfell episode 8 prince of winterfell theon receives a vistor and holds down the fort this is when asha comes to ridicule him natch i hope they keep his ugly ass crown episode 9 blackwater duh episode 10 valar morghulis the episode guide says arya calls in her last death in episode 8 but it can fit with her escape from harrenhal i typically dont nitpick but this does annoy me all of the episode titles last season matched up with the dramatic content titles are important"
"pavel",2012-05-07,"hello fellas been reading those forums for a while and i figured id start contributing a bit i hope this hasnt already been covered watching episode 6 got me to question tyrions plan to bring myrcella to safety i dont have my book 2 so i couldnt reread anything to double check but with a bit of research i found out the boat on which myrcella sails actually heads to braavos first and then heads to dorne i was seriously questioning tyrions decision of having his little princess sail a long distance in ennemy territory ie waters controlled by stannis but now it makes more sense however sailing from kings landing to braavos does appear to require getting somewhat close to dragonstone do the books every explain the route taken what makes tyrion believe she wont run into trouble we all know stannis whole fleet gets to kings landing pretty soon and tyrion knows it as well but does he have any information that lead him to believe myrcella has time to get out of harms way we know stannis last known location is around storms end after renlys death so most of his fleet must be there but that doesnt eliminate the risk of some ships patrolling near dragonstone as for alternative routes the only other choice would be making the trip on horse which would probably require squeezing between the stormlands and tyrell territory seems hazardous when you consider the tyrell havent declared for anyone yet im no sailor so i may have missed something so comments and precisions are appreciated"
