1	Ran	2014-05-04	Non-spoiler discussion of the show goes here, for those who've not read the books or those who have but are happy to not actually reference them at all in discussion, taking each episode as it comes.
This topic should open automatically when the show begins airing.

Â 
But I hate how there portraying Cersie.Â Â Â  Every thing she does this season is wrong.Â  She doesnt push the wedding of Tommen and Marg, She tries the opposite. She doesnt push Jamie away because thigs "change"Â  Its Jamie who pushes her away. More and more understanding he has been a puppet all his life to his sister and father.Â 
Â 
But other then that so far im enjoying the show.Â  I just dont know why there doing this to Cersie.

Â 
Personally, I much prefer show Cersei and I'm pretty sure she was just sucking up to Mace through Marg and will be back to opposing the wedding as soon as it is convenient for her. Â I don't mind them giving her some shreds of actual competence, as the book version bordered on a pretty offensive caricature at times. Â She's still a terrible human being, but one with an actual shot in hell of getting what she wants.

Â I think her true motivations and desires regarding a Margaery and Tommen wedding are unclear. She went along with what her father said about it, but she may have some tricks up her sleeve yet.

That sets her up to fall from a higher ground

Â 
There were a few things that didn't make sense in this episode.Â  Why didn't Locke kill Bran right away?Â  How did Jon know that Raster was dead?Â  If he was still alive, he could fall into wildling hands and spoil the Night's Watch's secrets.Â  Why did the women reject going with the Night's Watch AND burn the keep?Â  Where will they stay now, since it seems they were quite sheltered from the real world.
Â 
My predictions:
Â 
I have a feeling that Cersei is creating a trap for Margary.Â  Remember when Cersei told Margary if she ever called her sister, she'll hang?Â  Well Cersei is scheming right now.
Â 
I have a feeling Jojen is evil.Â  He's working for the Red god, and his mission is to destroy the tree and the crow, using his fire.Â  He will become full evil and stronger as he gets closer to Bran's destination, where Bran will have to kill Jojen.
9	Gneisenau	2014-05-05	Cersei wanting the marriage is just to make Mace Tyrell happy so he will be a better judge so to speak. She tried the same on Tywin and Oberyn.

Bran is more valuable as a hostage anyway. He is basically dead by most, only Ramsay and Roose learned from Theon that Bran is alive.
11	Rooseman	2014-05-05	Bran is more valuable as a hostage anyway.Â 


Â 
Hostage for what? All the Starks are presumed dead or disappeared.
Â 
Roose Bolton is Warden of the North, he can't claim Winterfell with the risk of a Stark heir showing up unannounced. He needs Bran dead and he can't be connected to it.
12	RumHam	2014-05-05	Bran is more valuable as a hostage anyway. He is basically dead by most, only Ramsay and Roose learned from Theon that Bran is alive.


Â 
I think it's more likely he planed to escape the chaos at Crasters with Bran, then interrogate him about Rickon's whereabouts before killing him and hanging on to his head. Â The deal with Roose was that he gets a holdfast if he kills both surviving Stark boys, and he had no other leads on where Rickon might be.
Â 
Edit: the real question is, how did he plan to get back across The Wall...

					
					
							Edited by RumHam, 05 May 2014 - 12:53 PM.
13	AryaSansa	2014-05-05	If Locke would just kill all 4, he would have succeeded in his mission, or at least, half of his mission.Â  And was he planning on carrying Bran back across the wall?
Â 
Also, how did he know Bran was there in the first place?Â  By luring the Night's Watch away, it seemed he implicitly knew they were Jon's brothers.Â  Why would he not question Jojen and see if he was Rickon Stark?
Â 
Also, if Bran was a hostage, why didn't Karl and his mutineer pals use them as hostages?
Â 
Did Arya plan to kill the Hound by piercing him?Â  Even with armor, a pointed blade is very good against armor if you thrust it hard.Â  Perhaps the Hound knew that she didn't have enough strength, that's why he didn't budge?
Â 
I think the best part was Lysa going crazy - she seemed a bit cuckoo in the first season, but this episode caught me off guard.Â Â  How do you go from lemon cakes to being pregnant?
14	boojam	2014-05-05	I think the best part was Lysa going crazy - she seemed a bit cuckoo in the first season, but this episode caught me off guard.Â Â  How do you go from lemon cakes to being pregnant?Anybody notice that Sucking Robin (Lino Facioli) looks pretty much the same as season 1?
15	AryaSansa	2014-05-05	I didn't like the tidbit that Lysa poisoned her husband.
Â 
It ruins the whole motive part where Jon was trying to expose the Lannister's incest.Â  Now it's all a coincidence.Â  Same with Jon's squire's death.
Â 
I didn't like how Bran *had* to choose between the crow and Jon.Â  I think Jon wouldn't mind Bran going on his quest, and at the very least, wouldn't stop him.Â  Just show Jon your warging abilities and you can convince anyone!
Â 
I liked the dual-wielding daggers fighting though.Â  Also the dirty fighting.Â  Would have liked seeing Karl and Bronn fight

Also, how did he know Bran was there in the first place?Â  By luring the Night's Watch away, it seemed he implicitly knew they were Jon's brothers.Â  Why would he not question Jojen and see if he was Rickon Stark?I assumed that the reason why Locke was there was to have an excuse to find an opportunity to kill Jon, and chanced upon finding Bran and a new opportunity.  I thought that's why he was there, too see if Bran and Rickon were secretly with Jon, and kill him anyway if they weren't.

Coincidence you say? Lysa didn't just poison her husband, she sent a letter to Catelyn blaming the Lannisters. And later on, Littlefinger put Ned on the trail of the bastards and blamed Tyrion for Bran's attempted murder. Join the dots

Â 

I liked it, it makes for at least decent drama: should Bran choose love over duty? duty over love? The series is filled with that sort of choice. Yeah, Jon might agree to let him go if he's convinced that Bran can help in the fight against the White Walkers. Or he might not be convinced. Or, convinced or not, he might forcefully take him to Castle Black so he can travel North at a later time, with actual, useful bodyguards. Bran chose the safest, and hardest, option.

Â 
Well it must have been a coincidence then, that Jon Aryn was investigating Robert's bastards, unless Little Finger was also in on that too.Â 
Â 
I just don't like it when people act irrationally.Â  I doubt Jon could have even prevented Bran from leaving.Â  All Bran has to do is command or warg Hodor to leave, and no one can stop him.Â  If anything, Jon may have accompanied him.Â  There's so much they have to tell each other.Â  I guess Bran assumes Jon knows all about Theon's treachery and other information, because if he didn't assume, the urge to tell Jon all he knows would be to great for him to not want to meet Jon.

It was not a coincidence. It made the Lannisters the best possible scapegoats.
21	AryaSansa	2014-05-06	It was not a coincidence. It made the Lannisters the best possible scapegoats.


Â 
So you are saying that Little Finger saw Jon Aryn snooping around, so then decided to tell Lysa to poison him because it would provide the best possible cover to murder him?Â  He would have to correctly predict that someone would find out about the investigation of the incest, otherwise the suspicion might fall on Lysa.
Â 
Possible, but then it's an entirely different motive.Â  But why wouldn't he wait after Jon Aryn found out and told King Robert?
Â 
I guess it's technically possible, but not very rational of him.
22	AryaSansa	2014-05-06	Why didn't Cersei talk with Mace Tyrell instead of Margaery?Â  If you want to butter up a judge you would go directly to the judge right?
23	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-06	Hmm, not if she wants to be a bit subtle I guess.

As for why not waiting until Robert knew, I guess If Robert knew, everyone would join against the Lannisters in a short and predictable war which wouldn't give him the opportunity to rise through the ranks, let alone destroy the Starks

Â 
Yes, but it was far from uncertain that the Lannisters would have came out on top.Â  Little Finger had no way of knowing Robert would die, Ned would die, Stannis would be defeated, Robb wouldn't have joined forces with Stannis, and so on.
Â 
I'll just write this one off as a plot hole and enjoy the series
26	Thrones123	2014-05-06	I don't think we've been shown Baelish's true motives yet, other than he wants everything and to rise in power, so I will wait and see as that becomes more clear.
Â 
in the next episode or so I expect Jon to gain much more power in the night's watch. Â thorne and slynt expected jon to die trying to kill the traitors, now he is coming back having defeated them and gaining momentum. Â it will be hard for the rest of the nigh'ts watch to ignore his accomplishments.
Â 
we haven't seen the wildlings south of the wall in a couple of episodes, seeing how quickly the boy got to castle black, you would have to assume they are very close. Â I guess still waiting for mance's troops to get in place north of the wall?
Â 
didn't see stannis for a couple episodes either, last time we saw davos he looked like a had an idea he was acting on. Â my guess is that it was to write to the iron bank asking for troops to go against the lannisters since they haven't paid back their debt, also tywin foreshadows this to cersei, making it seem like a real possibility.
Â 
dany's storyline is eh at best(haven't seen dragons in a long time), especially if all they show is how she is about to take over a city, the battle happens off screen, then it's just a bunch of slaves clapping for her.
Â 
what does anyone think of benjen stark, neds brother? we haven't seen him since season 1 when he disappeared north of the wall. Â if being a warg runs in the stark bloodline, bran, its possible he also has the capability, maybe he is somehow tied to the three eyed raven.
Â 
Â
27	AryaSansa	2014-05-06	Hmm, not if she wants to be a bit subtle I guess.


Â 
I guess, but she wasn't too subtle with Tywin or the other judge (the horny guy).Â  Also, talking to Mace directly would let her use her "grieving mother" argument directly.
Â 
Plus I'd like to see more screen time for Mace, he seems like a jolly fellow

Yah, Dany's plot has been boring ever since they got rid of that hunk Khal Drogo.Â  None of the other actors have the same screen presence.
Â 
Benjen stark died didn't he?Â Â  If he's not with the wildlings, then he's a white walker.Â  Hard to imagine him still being human and surviving all this time.

Â 
I don't think so, I think at one point it just shows his horse coming back to the wall without him on it, I dont think they ever mentioned it unless I missed it, but yeah seems rather unlikely that he is still alive, but maybe some room for hope
29	AryaSansa	2014-05-06	Anyone hoping for a Hound vs Brienne fight?Â  Maybe the Hound and Arya cross Brienne and Pod's paths, and they end up fighting each other.Â  They fight to a stalemate, and maybe Hound makes love to Brienne who share a common bond being outcast knights.
Â 
They then go their separate ways without Brienne knowing Arya is Cat's daughter.
Â 
Â 
Or maybe the Hound goes to the gate to the Vale, gets attacked, and they flee somewhere else, maybe to Braavos.Â  Seems unlikely that Arya will stay in the Vale, since her storyline has her ending up in Braavos because of that coin.
30	AryaSansa	2014-05-06	Oh another thing about Arya's future in Braavos.Â  Maybe she meets Syrio Farrell.Â  If Hound says that he can beat 3 Trants, then Syrio should be able too.Â  After Arya left, Syrio picks up the steel sword of a fallen knight.Â  Then he fends off Trant's attacks and says "Not today" to death and leaves off a ship to Braavos.Â  Easy to run away from a guy wearing armour 
Â 
Farrell was an amazing character.Â  Loved his hair too, despite what the Hound says

Â 
oberyn vs mountain is going to happen at some point, after all the talk of oberyns skill want to see him in action
Â 
agree that arya to bravos is the direction of her storyline, she goes there becomes an assassin with teaching from the one guy at harrenhal, jager or something? then starts taking names off her list, that could be seasons away though

I was on the verge of outrage when I saw Robin peering into the abyss ... and Lysa just drooling all over Littlefinger.Â  Then I remembered the insanity of her persona, and laughed.Â  Couldn't help myself.
34	AryaSansa	2014-05-07	I don't like how Arya tried to kill Hound.Â  She can kill him anytime she wants in his sleep, why would she try to kill him during her water dance?

36	Fantasy Character	2014-05-08	I apologize to the mods; I tried starting a thread (possibly in the wrong episode forum) but realized this would be a fine place to put my Littlefinger rant:
Â 
What is Littlefinger's shifty-eyed, foot-shuffling deal? Isn't he supposed to be a mastermind of manipulation? Things are falling right into place for him, and he's basically staring at the ground and walls during his scene with Lysa and going, "Er, um, YES my dear, I'm totally marrying you willingly. It's not just for political gain! And I'm certainly not obsessed with your niece."
Â 
I do not understand the choices made in portraying him this way in this scene. With that sort of body language, who would believe anything he said to her/him, ever? I don't think non-book readers need to be reminded of Littlefinger's creepy Sansa obsession from last episode or that he was in love with Catelyn. Do we really need it hammered home every episode that he's a moustache-twirling villain?
Â 
It pulls me right out of the show when I watch it.

38	longlivetyrion	2014-05-08	What's up with the dragons?Â  Haven't seen em in like two episodes.Â  And whenÂ Barristan and Jorah are talking to Danny about her chances of taking Westeros miltarily,Â they don't mention the dragons at all.Â Â They would be the cornerstone of my military plans.

yeah we haven't seen them in a while, i think dany is starting to have less control over them as shown in the early episode where they snapped back at her, so they are maybe just out on their own? i wonder if they are considered "old enough" to start fighting in wars, you would think the longer you wait the stronger they become and less chance of being killed

Â 
I am very curious about the Arya storyline, which, I agree must lead to Braavos. And she most likely will become an assassin. I assume we should see some drama when she starts taking people off her list. Arya will have stayed a while in Braavos and not be aware of all the internal developments in Kings Landing etc.; it seems likely she might kill someone out of her old hatred who in the meantime has changed sides (say for example she kills Sercei who in the meantime got married to Jon Snow, not that I think it's going to happen, but just as an example).
Â 
But I also assume there will be some turns until she even gets to Braavos. The Hound wants to bring her to the Vale, right? Where Lord Baelish is at the moment, and if he could he'd hand her over to whomever serves him best. Also if I remember correctly the Freys plan to conquer the Vale, so they may meet somewhere on the way to there.
42	Ran	2014-05-04	What'd you think of the episode?
43	SeA±or de la Tormenta	2014-05-04	First 40 minutes were boring as a dumphair chapter. I was giving it a 3....the last 20 were far better. It climbed to a 7, but Im just to tired of the almost Stark reunion been done so many times.
Its a 5
44	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-05-04	Kind of an average episode honestly. I was going to give it a 7 until the awesome ending, so a very generous 8. Definitely the weakest EP of the season. Can't wait for the trial next episode!

45	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-04	That was a solid 9 due to all the shit they crammed into it. This was the Info Dump EpisodeÂ<U+0099> and while there wasnt a lot of action, there was a lot of nuggets of stuff that help move the plot along. Plus the Craster's Keep business was awesome.
46	Scrambled Aegon	2014-05-04	what the fuck was that jon arryn reveal
47	Jamie Lannister	2014-05-04	5/10. Felt slow and plodding for most of the episode, with some truly stupid scenes (Jojen the pyromancer? What?) and a rather unengaging feel. The ending was admittedly fun and I liked the Eyrie save for the really inelegant exposition about Lysa's misdeeds, but overall it was by far the worst ep of the season.Â 
Â 
At least the effects were decent?

48	Pure Guava	2014-05-04	Â (Jojen the pyromancer? What?


Â 
Assuming it was a visual metaphor for his deteriorating condition, no? Like a vision of himself only he sees? Served well enough, I thought.
Â 
Anyway, I appreciate the show best when it combines the longer sequences with the "catching up" exposition episodes. Wolf and Hound scenes made me lol. Gave it a solid 8.
49	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-04	Nothing happened, really. Dunno, Lysa and Jon were the highlights. Also, Jojen being all "you're so dead right now" level of creepy. 7, I guess?
50	Ser Creighton	2014-05-04	5/10. Felt slow and plodding for most of the episode, with some truly stupid scenes (Jojen the pyromancer? What?) and a rather unengaging feel.

Jojen was having a vision of a burning hand, he wasn't making fire just seeing it, like he was seeing the tree. You may have gotten a rather large reaction from everyone had he actually created fire.
51	Kyrion	2014-05-04	I thought it was Jojen seeing his death, but slowly deteriorating makes more sense. He definitely knows hes going to die, since he said to Meera it doesn't matter, so thats good. He is aware of his mortality, which wasnt hinted at atall in the show yet.
Â 
Anyways, I thought this filler stuff could have been good even if it mean Coldhands was gone, but overall it was a waste of time, nothing even came out of it. If like maybe we learned something new(and the White Walker stuff could have been done last season with no difference) or new character something that would make the change worth it, but looking back at it, Coldhands would have been better.
52	Jslay427	2014-05-04	Locke dying surprised me a lot. Agree with it being weakest episode so far.
53	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-05-04	It wasn't a bad episode, but nothing really big happened. Gave it an 8, mostly because of Lysa and the showdown at Craster's.
54	franko99	2014-05-04	7/10 Good episode, but nothing really big happened.
Â 
My only complains are all small ones, like Rast death (I know all the CGI budget goes to the dragons, but we deserved to see some direwolf badassery) or Dany scene feels to rushed again, like they could have explain her reason to stay a bit better, and how the hell the news of Joff's death arrive so fast LOLÂ Â
55	JonDunn	2014-05-04	Are you guys nuts? Â Weakest episode of the bunch? Â IT was great!
Â 
Â 
Everything Vale/Arya/Jon/Oberyn was pretty fantastic. Â
56	Darth Pipes	2014-05-04	7/10.Â  Weakest episode of the season and I'm concerned because I think D and D have written the three weakest episodes of the season.Â  Though I liked the season premiere.
57	Fevre River Warrior	2014-05-04	I loved this episode and gave it a 10. I thought it was fabulous that Locke got what was coming to him, Jon and the NW got rid of those vipers at Crasters, Bran/Hodor/Summer/Meera and Jojen were on their way.....and the "good guys" finally won something. It was nice to finally see the good guys win at Crasters. HODOR!!! That was a great scene with him killing Locke.
Â 
I get so tired of evil winning over good in this series. I really liked this episode.
Â 
HODOR!!!
58	darksellsword	2014-05-04	I gave it an 8 could of done without the cersei Margaery scene , found it a bit hard to believe locke could sneak in take a look around and report back and then that Bran and the scooby gang could escape it all without any of the nightswatch seeing them. What was the point in that change anyone have a clue??
59	YourMomsBox	2014-05-04	It was a 6 or 7. An average episode and I kind of expected it after watching the preview. The scenes at the Vale were some of the best parts and contrary to what some are thinking, I feel that the Jon Arryn reveal was timed fine. 
Most scenes were solid but uneventful and that while Craster's Keep was good it was also pretty predictable that there would be no reuniting, that the bad guys get wiped out, Jon kills Carl, Ghost kills Rast. Easy to see coming.
Don't have a issue with some slower episodes amidst the chaos. Next week should be excellent.
60	Jslay427	2014-05-04	Show only people have to be confounded as fuck.
61	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-04	Next week Promo:
Â 
https://www.youtube....h?v=wB5W9x3-73U
62	Widows_Blood	2014-05-04	I gave it a 7. Lowest grade so far for me. I did enjoy most of the episode. This was just one of those episodes to set up future storylines. The trial and Vale plots specifically. Some of the exposition was kinda clunky, could do without that Cersei-Margarey scene.Â 
Â 
I really liked Sansa-Lysa. Thought that was really well done scene that will pay off down the line. Particularly enjoyed Sansa manipulating Lysa. Enjoyed most of what happened at Crasters alot as well. Wished Jon would have killed Karl without any interference though... Â
63	jarl the climber	2014-05-04	An all around interesting episode, a little slow, but a lot of info that moved the plot along. Most interesting tidbit was that the Lannister gold mines are not producing anymore. Interesting, I wonder if this diverges from the books or if the same factor is at work as well? Sort of backs my thoery that the Lannister incomes are dependent on the throne repaying the loans Tywin made to it. Never understood Tywins all or nothing attitude but if the base of Lannister power has failed it makes sense. I gave it a 7.
64	Ser Blake	2014-05-04	Definitely the weakest of the season so far. Â It just had a weird feeling throughout, and all of the scenes felt like they were just thrown together haphazardly. Â The long Cersei scenes just didn't do anything for me. Â  I understand they are showing she is trying to persuade the judges but they just all felt unnecessary Â and they all fell flat to me. Â Same goes for the Brienne and Pod scenes which were just meh to me.
Â 
I did really enjoy all of the arya/houn and sansa/littlefinger/lysa scenes. Â With the exception of her spoiling the murder of Jon Arryn, which I don't understand why they felt the need to reveal it early. Â Its such a integral part of one of GRRM best chapters, and yet they just wasted it in the middle of a middle season episode like it was no big deal. Â I have no problem with changes but this one I just don't get.
Â 
On the bright side the next episode should be best of the season. Â A Bryan Cogman written trial scene is sure to be phenomenal.Â

65	KingOfTheRock	2014-05-04	Good episode, but didn't like it as much as the rest of the season so far. 7. The Crasters Keep story this episode was good and I liked Arya/Hound too.
66	Konradsmith	2014-05-04	I gave it an eight. It would've been a seven but the end saved it. Lysa's return was welcome and Sansa overhearing her wedding night was a nice comedic note from the books.

67	shiola	2014-05-04	I am so pissed about them bumping up the Jon Arryn reveal that I want to give this episode, like, a 2. Â But I thought Thomas Brodie-Sangster was totally on point tonight. Â The way his voice got very low when he was telling Karl how he saw him die was brilliantly creepy. So much malice. And I loved Pod burning the rabbit. Â There were other good moments too but those are the ones that stick out at me enough to bump up the score to a 6.
68	ServantOnIce	2014-05-04	9/10 Â Best episode since the season opener. Â Great episode.

9/10 Solid episdoe
1. Great Acting, great writing.
2. Good fight scenes, I loved not knowing what was going to happen with Jon and Bran.
3. Locke's death shocked me. I thought he was going to be Bowen Marsh, but that would have been too obvious . . .
4. Locke had to kidnap Bran and kill him somewhere else. Then bring his corpse or his flayed skin to Roose. Roose would need proof of the kill.
5. It reminded me of the scene in, "Boardwalk Empire" when the lady stabbed Karl in the back. Just like it happened when Mr.Whatever fought Chalky White. Same scene but not as intense as the BE scene.
6. Lena Headey acted great, E. Clarke struggles with real dialogue, Iain Glen acted very well. Dany made the mistake now we are in the, "Mereenese Knot."
7. Next week is going total fan fiction with Davos in Braavos, The Ironborn at the Dreadfort, that is going to be something.
Bring it on Dave an Dan! Great TV!

Just because it's the weakest of the season doesn't mean it was bad. I think this has been the best first half of any season so far. Episodes 1-4 were all 9's or 10's IMO. We were due for a kind of average affair. Just by viewing the promo I can already tell next week will be far better: trial, Yara vs. Ramsey, etc.

They are rich as always in the books. Tyron doesnt worry about how he is paying the Second sons...and Kevan worries he has to start paying the crown debts with Lannister money...
And they got the Reynes mines.
71	Pure Guava	2014-05-04	Good, bad. Meh. The books have plenty moments where "nothing is happening" but your quench for depth is being sated. This was one of those episodes...with a salting of nice action scenes. No complaints here.
72	Sansafan14	2014-05-04	I gave it a 4.Â  Lots of filler conversations.Â  I did laugh for a while when Sansa had to endure Lysa s screaming.Â  That was ridiculiously funny.Â  As for the end, way too predictable!Â  How many fans were waiting for Hodor to warg into Bran and free everyone. I usually stay up to watch a second time but not this episode.Â  Good to see Arya waterdancing again!
73	sj4iy	2014-05-04	Loved it. Even better than last week's episode. Arya's water dancing, Lysa showing her insanity, the Lannisters are broke and finally, the ending that had everything I ever wanted in it. 10/10.
74	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-04	Just because it's the weakest of the season doesn't mean it was bad.
Â 


Â 
Actually, it's the lack of important shocking events what makes the episode looks "bad" to some. We can't have Kings dying every episode, isn't? And last week episode set the bar too high, sadly.
75	ServantOnIce	2014-05-04	7/10 Good episode, but nothing really big happened.
Â

78	Rolf Ruiz	2014-05-04	It was a 9 for me.Â 
Â 
I disliked the Margaery-Cersei and the changes to Sansa storyline. Â The reveal of Lysa killing Jon made sayÂ out loudÂ "WHAT?" but I'm ok being surprised by the show (like last week).Â 
Â 
I see the show with my Unsullied wife, and we enjoyed very much the Arya-Hound and Pod-Brienne parts. We got some good laughs there.Â 
Â 
I didn't liked very much how they were changing Bran storyline but I guess it's ok how they handled it today. The show doesn't show a lot of magic stuff and they have to create a bridge so show watchers can assimilate what is next. Â I expected Locke to have a confrontation with Jon and I was pleased they didn't.Â 
Â 
I don't know why people say nothing happened in this episode. Â I explained my wife a lot of stuff between scenes (Oberyn's daughters to name an example). Â Non book readers need to understand and get familiarized with the Iron Bank of Braavos, they need to understand Dany's forces are still laughable compared to anything in Westeros.Â 
Â 
I usually re-watch each episode between 3 to 4 times the week it airs, this one is gonna be one of those that makes to 4-5.Â
79	Lady White Wolf	2014-05-04	I gave it a solid 9 - I didn't even realize 45 minutes had gone by.  Lots of information, but my favorite part was Sansa and nutty Lysa.
80	ServantOnIce	2014-05-04	Weakest of the Season? Episodes 3 and 4 stank . . . Â Â
81	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-05-04	It was a slower episode than some others, but still a good episode. Not the best this season, by any means. I'd give it an 8.11 repeating.
82	cybobbie	2014-05-04	It was my lowest rate for this season so far (7), but there were some nice parts and others that really bothered me.
I don't like this nice Cersey at all and the fact that she didn't react at all to Marg's comments was too much for me. I also didn't like this news that the Lannisters are broke, where they wanna go with this? On the up side, I really liked that they managed to solve the Jon / Bran situation in a good way, I also enjoy Arya and The Hound scenes as well as Pod and Brienne. However I do think that they are going too far with Pod's stupidity. The highlight was of course having crazy Lysa back, she rocked on this episode and really screamed for all Westeros to listen - but it gave me the impression that she was giving birth to a giant!!

I swear that was already in AFFC...

OT 6/10. Not very good imo. Vale scenes were good but the filler was off the scale.

85	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-04	King's Landing was BORING and Cersei whitewashing is very evident. Lysa was entertaining (plus how cool was the Bloody Gate?). Craster's was cool, although the swordfighting was subpar (par for the course with this show). Dany's scene was the worst. Brienne and Pod were fun.
Â 
Weakest episode of the season, definitely. Not bad exactly, but disappointing. I'm gonna rewatch before voting but my initial rating is 6/10.
86	Rolf Ruiz	2014-05-04	I swear that was already in AFFC...
Â 
OT 6/10. Not very good imo. Vale scenes were good but the filler was off the scale.


Â 
Damn, Then I need to reread AFFC and ADWD... this time in Spanish so I do not miss things like that. That was embarrassing.Â
87	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-05-04	Cersei was working the judges to make them vote against Tyrion. She wasn't trying to be friendly. People complain when the show isn't subtle, but when it is subtle, they don't get it haha
88	KalibakCruel	2014-05-04	Hard to judge. Had some great scenes. Loved the Lysa scenes, the Northern scenes, Arya/Hound always great. And i didn't mind the kings landing scenes despite not a lot going on...
But the Dany scenes are becoming unbearable. Daario sucks something awful, the acting is just not at all there, and nothing happened except the revelation that we're stuck in Mereen for the foreseeable future.

90	shiola	2014-05-04	I swear that was already in AFFC...
Â 
OT 6/10. Not very good imo. Vale scenes were good but the filler was off the scale.


Â 
It was, but it was in the last chapter of AFFC, in a very pivitol scene, and it was revealed in a completely different way.
91	Shags the Dog	2014-05-04	I think it's similar to "The Climb" from last season. It mostly set up for moments down the road but the end scene with Jon provided some good action.
92	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-05-04	Â 
It was, but it was in the last chapter of AFFC, in a very pivitol scene, and it was revealed in a completely different way.


No, it's was at the last chapter of ASOS, right before the epilogue. Lysa is already dead in AFFC.
93	Peachie	2014-05-04	There was a lot of filler/set up but I spent a lot of the episode with my hand in front of my mouth, nevertheless.Â 
Â 
+++ bonus points for Lysa and her dessertsÂ 
+++ bonus points for PodÂ 
Â 
Was this the first episode with no Tyrion?Â
94	sastelise	2014-05-04	Meh. Too many inexplicable deviations. Why is Cersei being so nice and understanding to everyone? Why doesn't Jon know that his brother is at Craster's if both their dire wolves are locked up in the same pen? Why does everyone abuse Hodor?! I give it a 6. The only worthy part was Pod.
95	Baltan	2014-05-04	A nice 7.
Â 
I liked how they wrapped up part of the story of Bran and Jon. Those changes in their storylines had averted me to give a 10 to last week episode. No more Karl nor HBOLocke , (almost) everything back to normal.
Â 
The Eyrie scenes were the best of the episode, really well done Kate Dickie! And Sweet Robin was just perfect.
Â 
We had a little bit of almost every story arc, setting the pieces back to the game.
Â 
Only the finale was a bit weak, but again, it was filling for Bran's storyline, and they're getting better at it, so fine with me.
Â 
Â 


thought Jon was a decent swordsman, and that chump beats him with two kitchen knives vs a Valyrian steel sword?


Â 
Yeah, I was thinking: shouldn't Lonclaw just cut through a pair of knives? Were they even steel?
Â 
But Jon got his leg pierced (again) so I'm happy that we're going to see a limping Jon in the Battle of the Wall.
96	Knight of Ashes	2014-05-04	I thought nothing could be creepier than Joff and Sansa kissing and Selyse's 'preserves' but Littlefinger and Lysa playing tonsil hockey managed to top both.
I give it a 7. It was actually the Craster's Keep scenes that I found predictable.
Cersei rolling her eyes at Margaery was much more interesting.
97	lostinwesteros	2014-05-04	Gave it a 7, a notch or two below my usual ratings.  Nothing I particularly disliked, but my least favorite scene was the Craster's action at the end, which a lot of posters liked the best. Just not sure why we had to focus on the whole Craster's storyline so much this season, anyway, and don't understand why Bran, et.al. ended up there unless it was just a filler so the Bran story wouldn't be forgotten.  
Lots of things I did really like, though.  I always love Arya/Sandor scenes and any with Brienne and/or Pod.  Crazy, creepy Lysa - fun to watch LF's struggle to suppress revulsion while she threw herself all over him.  Could almost see Sansa wondering what the hell kind of horror show she was in now.  
Can't believe we're already 1/2 way through the season.

							Edited by Knight of Ashes, 04 May 2014 - 11:56 PM.
99	Mr Smith	2014-05-04	A 7 for me. Good, but far from spectacular.
Â 
Wasn't very keen on Cersei and Margaery reaching some sort of truce in the interests of helping Tommen; Joffery's death is supposed to make her spiral out of control, seeing shadows everywhere.
Â 
I did like her conversation with Oberyn, but it wouldn't have hurt to have her attempt to seduce him, in order to escape from marriage to Loras AND to try and get him to vote against Tyrion in the trial.
Â 
The Lannister mines have dried up? First I've heard.
Â 
Brienne stuff = snorefest, just like the book.
Â 
The raid on Craster's keep was very well done, but I think knowing that everyone makes it out safely kind of took the edge off.
100	shiola	2014-05-04	No, it's was at the last chapter of ASOS, right before the epilogue. Lysa is already dead in AFFC.


Â 
Oh my god. Â You're right. Â I got the book titles mixed up. Â I feel like an asshole.
101	A Man Reads	2014-05-04	They always seem to have an episode or two that lag midway through the season. This was one of them. I gave it a 7/10 mostly because of the scenes north of the wall (which has recently been carrying the show). I get that they have to set up major plot twists . . . but the result is a lagging, plodding episode.Â
102	Antoinetta	2014-05-04	I would give it 4 out of 5 goblets of Dornish wine. I didn't this episode was too slow. I found myself paying very close attention,especially with Lysa and Littlefinger. I enjoyed the action scenes.  Everything seems to be building up to somethimg bigger this season ( i did read the books), but i think the show does a pretty good job with the build up.
Oh, i should mention that i do love Brianne and think Gwendoline Christie plays her well. She portrays her how insae her in the books. She's a bit saucy.
103	Batavian	2014-05-04	Better than last week.
104	Ran	2014-05-04	108 votes in, 7.53 average, 7 median, 7.57 normalized average.
Â 
Gave it a 7, myself. The stuff beyond the Wall kind of ended in a whimper, while the King's Landing stuff highlighted how much softer and less compelling I find Cersei on the show. That said, folks, Cersei was not just being nice -- she was working on each of the three judges -- and it says something about the way the show-runners have decided to do things, that Margaery is the obvious stand-in for the judges rather than, you know, Mace Tyrell who's actually THERE and has hardly been used at all despite being played by a distinguished actor; couldn't he have at least been a part of the conversation? -- to subtly, more or less, influence them on Tyrion's trial.
Â 
Kate Dickie is fantastic, though, and the Arya-Hound stuff was pretty good, I thought. Oh, and whether it's spoilery or not, I thought Thomas Brodie-Sangster's performance as Jojen touched on Bran's destiny and his own fate suitably creepy; well performed, on his part, and well-written by the writers. I do think they missed some opportunities with the Night's Watch attack on Craster's, though, and maybe finished up using Locke too quickly.

105	DanyStark	2014-05-04	The Jon and Ghost reunion was everything! Interesting play between Tywin and Cersei. Is there mention of Westerland gold mines in the books? I don't recall. I wonder if non book folk even realize at this point who Jon Arryn is and how much Littlefinger owns everyone!!!
106	Ran	2014-05-04	The Casterly Rock thing is for the show. No danger of the mines running out in the novels. The reason Tywin doesn't just buy the crown out all its debts in the books is that there _are_ limits to how much wealth he has on hand (he's already a substantial debt holder as it is) and he's not going to cripple the house by tying up all of its wealth with the crown. The reason Cersei doesn't do the same is likely in emulation of that, with the added bonus that she well-and-truly believes that she can tell the Iron Bank to go hang.
107	Fagatron	2014-05-04	Are you guys nuts? Â Weakest episode of the bunch? Â IT was great!
Â 
Â 
Everything Vale/Arya/Jon/Oberyn was pretty fantastic. Â 
I was thinking the same thing. And boy they did a great job with Cersi manipulating her Dad, Margery, and O (the judges).
And I had a fun time watching Pod and Brianne. 
Then there was Arya and the Hound, with Arya getting another lesson about life&death and a nice little slap for her to remember. 
So with great things happening for some of my favorite characters... I thought it was an awesome episode. I'm giving it an 8 out of 10. 
Though I hate that they made Pod so useless... C'mon he is smart enough to know that a rabbit isn't cooked with its fur. Yeah I'm nitpicking about that. 
Pod should be on next seasons 'Worst Cook in Westros'.

Cercei sending a ship to Myrcella and getting close to Oberyn; Tywin discussing financial vulnerability and how everything belongs to the bank; Craster's women acting all rebel; Cercei not being so evil (frst time she's not behaving like she's got her period in a long time); Brienne being so STYLISH...
109	Fagatron	2014-05-04	I loved this episode and gave it a 10. I thought it was fabulous that Locke got what was coming to him, Jon and the NW got rid of those vipers at Crasters, Bran/Hodor/Summer/Meera and Jojen were on their way.....and the "good guys" finally won something. It was nice to finally see the good guys win at Crasters. HODOR!!! That was a great scene with him killing Locke.
Â 
I get so tired of evil winning over good in this series. I really liked this episode.
Â 
HODOR!!!

Hodor, HorDOr,  HODoR!
110	K-26dp	2014-05-04	Solid 8. Great job by Lena Headey this episode. "Everywhere in the world they hurt little girls." So much packed into that, and Oberyon with his eight daughters gets it. An unlikely pair to be actually talking to each other instead of past or around each other like most Kings Landing conversations.Â 
Â 
Loved Arya creeping the Hound out and then the Hound schooling Arya the next morning. Also, they're really building the Mountain back up this season, really looking forward to the character's return.
Â 
They also did a surprisingly nuanced job of showing Hodor's confusion and dismay after the warging.
Â 
Even good ole' King Cleon got a mention.
111	Fagatron	2014-05-04	I would give it 4 out of 5 goblets of Dornish wine. I didn't this episode was too slow. I found myself paying very close attention,especially with Lysa and Littlefinger. I enjoyed the action scenes.  Everything seems to be building up to somethimg bigger this season ( i did read the books), but i think the show does a pretty good job with the build up.
Oh, i should mention that i do love Brianne and think Gwendoline Christie plays her well. She portrays her how insae her in the books. She's a bit saucy.

Yes a Saucy minx indeed. And she has the strapping 'hung' Pod to help her out of her Armor at night.
112	Lundy	2014-05-04	I wanted a longer story arc for Locke. Oh well.
113	Lord Godric	2014-05-04	I'm surprised but also not surprised to see this episode voted so low. I'm sure a lot of book fans have their purist caps on,Â
114	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-04	Thought it was a good episode.Â 
Â 
I was a little conflicted with the way the Jon Snow/Karl Tanner showdown went. On one hand, I thought it was awesome when that girl stabbed Karl in the back, he definitely had that coming. On the other hand, I dislike that Jon was seconds away from being killed by that Gin Alley scum.Â 
Â 
My humble opinion is that they should have had Jon outclass him, he's a scumbag assassin who's been doing nothing but drinking for who knows how long. Overall I'm disappointed in how that went down. Loved when he punched Longclaw through the back of his head though.Â
115	Russellstiltskin	2014-05-04	I liked that when Arya added some names to her "prayers," she seemed to consider whether to include the Hound.Â  It was pretty clutch the way she let him hear his name.
Â 
And although the show seems to be taking a different tack with their story (the inn scene from a couple episodes ago) I have to say, I thought she definitely stabbed him, that was unexpected for reader's.
Â 
I want the series to be respectful of the books, as it seems to be thus far, but I enjoy it when they change things up a little; they even seem to elaborate occasionally on some things.
116	averde	2014-05-04	An all around interesting episode, a little slow, but a lot of info that moved the plot along. Most interesting tidbit was that the Lannister gold mines are not producing anymore. Interesting, I wonder if this diverges from the books or if the same factor is at work as well? Sort of backs my thoery that the Lannister incomes are dependent on the throne repaying the loans Tywin made to it. Never understood Tywins all or nothing attitude but if the base of Lannister power has failed it makes sense. I gave it a 7.


The gold mines comment was an interesting little moment in the show. It gave me cause, as a book reader, to contemplate the meaning of it.Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Besides that point I'm a 6 for the episode. Overall the episode felt pretty flat in my opinion. Craster's Keep battle went pretty much exactly as I thought it was going to with Bran not meeting Jon and Locke dying. Cersei is plotting and scheming again and took up way too much screen time doing it. The writing for show Tywin seems to get worse and worse every episode. Overall just a meh episode.Â
117	Fagatron	2014-05-04	Cersei was working the judges to make them vote against Tyrion. She wasn't trying to be friendly. People complain when the show isn't subtle, but when it is subtle, they don't get it haha

I loved the subtle touches with Cersi. Though of course they go and ruin it with Tywin telling her out right that he can't be manipulated by her because he is a judge. 
Though they did recover with her jab about what punishment he was going to give tyrion. Since he has already disowned Jamie and all he did was refuse his duty to his father and family.
It it were me I would have left Tywin for last in the manipulation scenes.
118	Russellstiltskin	2014-05-04	I thought they could have done a better job with the LF reveal.Â  And what the hell was up with Jojen's hand being on fire?Â
119	Russellstiltskin	2014-05-04	Yeah that was clutch what Cersei said about what Tywin thought Tyrion deserved if he would shun/disown Jaime for not being quite a good enough Team Lannister Player, and Tywin didn't look like he thought Tyrion would avoid punishment; rather the look on his face seemed to imply that he didn't relish what he thought he may likely have to do with Tyrion...It was an interesting moment.
120	Russellstiltskin	2014-05-04	The Gold Mines comment was interesting, though for some reason, though I was shocked, I thought he was likely lying to Cersei to rein in her extravagance and make her more responsible and forward-thinking regarding House Lannister's future.Â  I didn't remember it from the books, and I thoughtÂ it would stand out to me if it was in the novels but it made me wonder nonetheless.
121	lil_z	2014-05-04	Great dialogue all around I think. Tywin/Cersei, Oberyn/Cersei. I thought the concerns of the Lanisters was interesting. The reveal that Arya wished Hound dead. The resolution of Daenerys.
Â 
9/10
122	wallofice	2014-05-04	I actually really enjoyed most of this episode - at least on a scene-by-scene basis. It didn't do much to move the plot forward, but it did reveal a lot of things about the characters.
123	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-04	Fantastic episode. Had some great dialogue fast paced and funny. I can't remember an episode where I laughed so much. Until mopey Cersi had to bring the mood down . I felt the action scenes at the end were a bit clumsy. But still a nice ending. I was tempted to give it a 10 but settled on an 8.
Â 
My only real complaints would be really nit picking at stuff like why was Locke trying to take Bran with him rather than slitting his throat right there. How is Hodor able to walk within 24 hours of a spear going through his leg.
Â 
But yeah really entertaining episode. Which is what it's all about.
124	Hielo y Fuego	2014-05-04	The changes to the Bran and Jon arcs were very predictable, IMO. And the rest of the chapter was too slow and somewhat boring for me (except for Brienne & Pod, which I found hilarious).
Â 
The battle at Craster's was entertaining, though. But I was really disappointed with Locke's death.
Â 
All in all, the weakest ep. this season for me. A 5, at best.
125	Jorah the Explorer	2014-05-04	It wasn't a very good episode, I rated it a 6.
Â 
I was never terribly impressed with their invented scenes in previous seasons, but a few this season I really liked. Â Not the case in this episode, though. Â All in all I'm quite worried about next season, because they don't have good writing to fall back on. Â With all of the big moments left in season 4, it's pretty much a walk in the park for it to be good TV. Â But they'll really have to get better at writing to make season 5 interesting at all.
126	Bimmerella	2014-05-04	So I think we all agree, that this episode was probably the least exciting so far, BUT, I cannot bring myself to use the word worst, because they are ALL good.  Worst indicates bad, and you must admit, there is nothing bad about this show.  The visuals are epic, the costuming is beautiful and the actors are simply brilliant!! This is epic television folks, that nothing on air today or in past even comes close to.  
This episode had a lot of housekeeping to do.  That can be rather tedious, but imagine you are just a viewer not a reader.  That scene between Lord Baelish and Lady Lysa, was a bombshell.  I feel thankful there wasnt a sex scene though.  Hey I'm a red blooded American girl who isnt afraid to admit to enjoy a good sex scene, just like most, but seeing Baelish do Lady Lysa would have damaged me.  Hearing it was quite enough....and seeing Sansa hear it made me wanna jump out the moon door for her at her realization of what a effed up situation she is in YET AGAIN.  
Seeing Dany's scene tonight made me wonder if she will actually ever even go back to Westeros, since she already refers to herself as a queen, who intends to reign in what she has conquered and rule.  Did anyone else get that vibe?? Maybe her dragons will be necessary for "the big one" and that will bring her to Westeros.  Just a thought.  
By far my favorite part tonight was Bran, first calling for his brother Jon, then actually seeing his beloved bastard brother in full warrior mode.  Longing for a reunion, but knowing he will not get it.  I actually cried a bit during that part.  Bran seeing Jon at least threw us a bone, as to how these children want to find each other.  Brans expression as Jojen was telling him they had to leave, was heart breaking.  
It did at least end with ONE reunion and that was Jon and Ghost.  So the last 20 min of tonight's show was an emotional rollercoaster.   Not the best ride, but still damn good :-)
127	Ran	2014-05-04	152 votes, 7.53 average, 8 median, 7.57 normalized average.
Â 
The average and normalized average are the closest I've ever seen, I think. At least this season.
Â 
And let me add, there's a major lack of votes under 5. It's not hardcore purists vs. hardcore fans, as we've seen in some others where the distribution is very different. Most people just seem to be a bit cool on it.

128	Nictarion	2014-05-04	Gave it a 7. If not for some badassery by Jon at the end would have been lower. That's 2 episodes in a row now I felt were a little too slow. I know it's the middle of the season, but I hope it picks up next week.

Â 
Â 

That's all the show needs. Gave it a 9.
131	IlAovatar	2014-05-04	7/10
Â 
- Good to finally see Daenerys start to falter a bit.
- Lysa's scenes with Sansa were great.
- Pleased they didn't have Bran and Jon meet each other.
- Hound/Arya were good as usual, as were Brienne/Pod.
Â 
- Disappointed to see Locke die so soon, although Bran using Hodor to kill him was a nice touch.
- The 1v1 between Jon and Karl felt a bit contrived. I guess that's what the average viewer wants though.

132	Lady Beyond the Wall	2014-05-04	I feel like Bran's story was redeemed. With "Locke" dead and no meeting with Jon I think he is back on track. Nobody knows he is beyond the wall. Jon was amazing. Loved him. He could have been a little bit happier to see Ghost though. Arya was relatively pointless. Her story could use a push forward. Loved the Eryrie scenes. Cersei was fantasticly manipulative. Tommen was adorable, and Tywin was perfect, as if he would be anything less. I think he is probably the most perfectly well cast character. Ever.
Edit: I gave it a seven

133	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-05-04	7.5
Â 
Little Finger got his voice back! Dance always guarantees at least a 6. Sophie Turner is really maturing as an actress.
Â 
I felt the Locke death was a bit rushed(yet predictable), really felt like filler.
134	rmholt	2014-05-04	I rate it a solid 10 for how hard I laughed at all the proposed Locke scenarios. And for Margaery calling Cersei sister. Cersei's up to something.
135	Daenerys Must Die	2014-05-04	Enjoyed it quite a bit - obviously not "edge of your seat" stuff.. but sitting back to take in a pretty well-written, overall well-acted episode was nice - especially with the added visuals of the Vale. Craster's seemed a proper way to force some excitement/action into an otherwise 'build-up' type of episode so I didn't mind it despite it feeling a little unnatural with all of the convergences (repeat of the Queenscrow pretty much.. with Bran warging hodor.. Jon fighting and they narrowly miss each other - which I'm glad they did of course) The sword/knife fight between Jon/Karl was really well choreographed although I've never been big on "Spartacus (Starz)" types of over-the-top deaths like that; I know most people are so I have no real complaints about how it went down.
Â 
7.5/10 (rounded up)

Ep.1 - 8
Ep 2- 7 (Boltons 10)

136	Hielo y Fuego	2014-05-04	Is it me or is this show going off the rails bad?


Â 
It definitely stumbled due to the changes to the Bran & Jon storylines (at least IMO), but now that that's back on track, here's hoping things pick up in the 2nd. half of the season.
137	Jntam93	2014-05-04	I gave it a 9. I actually really enjoyed this episode, I loved the Eyrie scenes and Lysa being her psycho self. Kind of weird how Littlefinger says Alayne is his niece not his daughter, very minor though. King's Landing scenes were ok, Cersei and Margaery's scene together over Tommen was pretty enjoyable though. Arya and The Hound scene was really funny, her anger with him is really starting to come through.Â 
Â 
I agree with others that the Bran and Jon change was predictable, I don't really like it but when Bran was deciding whether to continue his journey or go with Jon I teared up, same thing with the Ghost reunion. Glad to see that this filler for the both of them is over with.
Â 
Another plus, only 3-5 minutes of screen time for Daenerys
138	Dragonglass Order	2014-05-04	I give it a 7. Â Not the greatest, but not the worst of the season.
Â 
The Jon Arryn reveal seemed kind of clumsy. Â But I liked the Sansa and Lysa scene and the Brienne and Pod scene. Â I really liked Karl's death, but the rest of that scene was pretty predictable.
139	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-04	Â Hey I'm a red blooded American girl who isnt afraid to admit to enjoy a good sex scene, just like most, but seeing Baelish do Lady Lysa would have damaged me.

140	gandalf.ohwaitwrongseries	2014-05-05	what the fuck was that jon arryn reveal


Eaxctly my reaction. This alone makes this episodes extremely disappointing. It now makes little doubt Only Cat will be in ep.7
141	Hoo	2014-05-05	I gave it a 7.
Â 
Very happy that Daenerys will finally settle down and rule.
The kill shot at Craster's was EPIC.
Warging was awesome.
Oh, the moon door, the creepiest piece of architecture in all of Westeros.
It takes a special kind of man to romance Lady Arryn.

nonsenseÂ
143	gawain	2014-05-05	I fully understand the importance of those episodes that serve merely to move the story along and present viewers with new information and revelations. Ep. 5, however, did nothing to amuse me. Not a terrific episode by any means. A solid 6, I'd say.

					
					
							Edited by gawain, 05 May 2014 - 12:05 AM.
144	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-05-05	Definitely not the weakest episode of the season. I actually enjoyed most of this one. Finally Jorah is getting some screen-time, and Bran's warging scenes are always killer. The conversations were interesting, the fight was awesome, and it's a pretty solid episode overall.
145	gandalf.ohwaitwrongseries	2014-05-05	Â 
nonsenseÂ 


Not sure what your "nonsense" refers to, but if it's about the LF being behind everything big reveal, it should really have been left for way later in the season (ideally ep.10) :Â  in the books it marks a milestone in plot advancement (arguably the biggest reveal at that point), here it will just be overlooked and probably forgotten by most Unsullied.
Plus, this means Only Cat in ep.7, and I happen to very much like that scene, was hoping they would keep it for ep.10.

Â 
At the same time though, imagine the people who haven't read the books at all. These scenes have to be just brutal for them, they need a reason to keep them intrigued. Maybe adds a little pop to this one, shows how crazy Lysa is too.
147	Mr Hodor	2014-05-05	Lysa was good and so was Cersei and Karl, but overall the slowest episode till now
148	Ser Jimmy of House McNulty	2014-05-05	I give this episode a 4. Too many moments where I went ''huh?'' out loud.
Â 
Why were LF and Sansa walking up to the Bloody Gate? Did their ship from KL drop them off in the middle of the Mountains of the Moon?
Â 
Why would LF and Lysa talk about Sansa being Sansa in front of the Sweetrobin? He sure looks like he can keep a secret.
Â 
I didn't like that Arya added Beric and Thoros to her hit list.
Â 
The Jon Arryn reveal was WAY too underwhelming.Â

Â 
Yeah, that part was just stupid. To couple Thoros and Beric with rapists and murderers just makes no sense. Just another example of the show douching everybody up.
150	yushkevitch	2014-05-05	While the episode may have seem slow to some it did move the story forward in a few very significant ways so I gave it an 8:
Â 
1) Dany isn't coming to Westeros any time soon.
2) Bran and Jon won't meet, the little guy will keep heading north.
3) Littlefinger marries Lysa and a little more of his plan his revealed.
4) Marg will marry Tommen.
5) The Iron Bank is dangerous and Tywin is clearly intent on repaying them.
Â 
On the other hand:
Â 
1) Another odd couple adventure with Brienne and Pod. For me, her chapters in the books were the hardest to get through: (She's looking for a girl and we all know she's looking in the wrong place. Make that "places", a LOT of places.) The show isn't making it much more bearable, just shorter.
Â 
2) Oberyn's story this season started of with a serious bang (he's in KL for revenge). Now he's attending weddings, writing poetry, having heartfelt discussions with Cersei in the gardens. Yeah, I know where his arc is headed, obviously, it's just the path to get there sucks the life out of the amazing aura he created in one brief scene with Tyrion.
151	Hoo	2014-05-05	Beric handed over Gendry to Melisandre so I can understand that.
152	edgeroc	2014-05-05	Going to give this one an 8, slightly above last week. The best thing to me not being a book reader is that after watching this show for 4 seasons now I have come to expect the unexpected. The last few minutes when Locke was carrying Bran off I was on the edge of my seat, I had no idea what was going to happen.
Â 
Any episode with the amazing Charles Dance gets high marks right from the top.
Â 
Cersei and Margery. I expected that at some point Cersei would show her true colors but instead we see a mother in pain and vulnerable, such a fantastic job.Â 
Â 
The big reveal with Littlefinger. He has always struck me as the most scumbag character in this show and boy did he not disappoint.Â 
Â 
The only thing I didn't really like in this episode was Brianne and Pod. I just thought it felt forced and compared to the rest of the episode it seemed out of place.
Â 
Finally the scene at Crasters. I realize they can't show too many battles in this show, be it for the sake of budget or simply for character advancement. I was happy with the end of it and glad they put a little bit of time into it then just a fade to black and aftermath.
Â 
I envy the book readers for seeing more of the vision then us show watchers but at the same time seeing the things unfold for the first time on screen has not been matched in my lifetime. The best part is more is left to come.
153	rmholt	2014-05-05	Â 
Yeah, that part was just stupid. To couple Thoros and Beric with rapists and murderers just makes no sense. Just another example of the show douching everybody up.

To be fair in the books nobody sold one of her only friends to a creepy stranger.
154	of man and wolf	2014-05-05	Yeah I noticed she had Beric and Thoros on her list, but no mention of Roose Bolton. I guess she wouldn't know that Roose stabbed Robb though.
155	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-05-05	To be fair in the books nobody sold one of her only friends to a creepy stranger.


Â 
Exactly. The show douches everyone up, from Stannis to the R'hllor bros.
156	Gneisenau	2014-05-05	Casterly put of gold aside, it was a pretty good episode.
157	Night'sQueen	2014-05-05	Loved it. Even better than last week's episode. Arya's water dancing, Lysa showing her insanity, the Lannisters are broke and finally, the ending that had everything I ever wanted in it. 10/10.

I loved this episode! Pod & Brienne, Arya & the Hound, Marg calling Cersei sister -- then mother!!, batshit crazy Lysa, the looks on Sansa's face first at the ridiculous screaming of Lysa and then at the news she will have to marry Robin, action at Craster's. It was all so good. Plus, I like the way they resolved the near miss of Bran and Jon, and I'm pleasantly surprised that it was done so well.  Hodor!
Sophie Turner wins this episode. She was brilliant.
ETA: And Ghost dealing out some justice was awesome!

The response across the internet seems to be that it was a return to form and one of the best eps od the season
159	scolbert08	2014-05-05	Better than episodes 1 and 3, not quite as good as episodes 2 or 4. I'd give it a solid 8 or 9.
Â 
I don't understand how people thought that this was a dull episode. The entire beyond the wall sequence had me on the edge of my seat. All of the Vale/Lysa scenes were great and set up "Only Cat" well. I liked the reference to the Sand Snakes and to what's happening in Yunkai and Astapor, plus the ironicÂ line about little girls not getting hurt in Dorne.
Â 
Looking forward to seeing what they do with Yara vs. Ramsay next episode.

Â 
Loved Sophie, as her panic rose to a hysterical pitch of fright.
Great acting..
I shared the tension.
Â 
Would have loved to hear the crunching of skull, as Ghost chomped down.
Â 
I hope to see a band of Craster girls,
nymphsÂ of the forest,

the unwary traveler.Â 
Â 
I'm a dreamer..
Â 
Â
165	Queen of Whores	2014-05-05	5 out of 10. Worst episode of the series in my opinion, rivaled only by The Bear and The Maiden Fair and The Climb. We are now seeing yet again the massive downside of extending A Storm of Swords over 20 hours. Nothing that happened in that book happened in this episode. This is pretty much licensed fanfiction at this point. All the acting and writing is wooden and dull and underwhelming as shit, and the pace is crawling slower than a snail. And what the fuck was up with that Jon Arryn murder plot reveal?

I'm too tired to complain about this more, but basically I thought everything in this episode sucked. I can't think of a single positive remark to make.Â
166	Alboin	2014-05-05	(-) Dany scene was awful in terms of drama itself (everything said right out like it is daytime soap-opera) and (sadly) acting.
(-) Wasn't it weird that Cersei who's hating Marg guts, which was repeatedly established on the show, suddenly and diligentlyÂ starts to forge the alliance??? I didn't get it.Â 
(-) Bran, who yelled "Jon! Jon!" just a few seconds ago is saying literally "Oh, well... He won't take me North, good-bye"... This is just stupid IMO.
(-) Arya and the Hound are first time in a "minus zone" for me. If she wanted to kill him and he just stands - God, hit him in his ugly face with your Needle, you're bad enough for that at this time...
Â 
Omitting "meh" stuff, the only thing I really enjoyed (like most of the people) is Jon's attack. (not Eyrie, because of some suddenly very unsatisfying performance by Sophie. I always like her acting a lot). But besides Bran thing (see above) I had some trouble wolf-wise (wHo let Ghost go? Where the hell is Summer?), although I understand that this is most likely budget thing.Â 
Â 
It was 6 for me being very generous.

168	Metopheles	2014-05-05	I don't get the high votes. People that was an horrible episode. The only good stuff was in KL and the Vale.
How can this episode get so much praise, and others are so heavily criticised?

Thank god most people have better taste.

Â 
Agree about the Vale. And the ending was anything but bad; maybe not a Dracaris moment, but still pretty good. I think this was more like episode 3. A lot of set up, decent scenes, nothing bad, nothing great either.
171	Metopheles	2014-05-05	I am usually not a hater, especially not against the show, but that was just an awful episode. Heavily disappointed. Especially with all the hype about it
172	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-05	7/10 on rewatch - some things were unclear to me on initial viewing (what Cersei was up to, mostly), but that's a personal problem
Â 
I enjoyed the Craster's Keep stuff. Even though it was filler, it was highly entertaining. The scenes in the Eyrie were great. Brienne and Arya's scenes were fun. Dany's scene was okay. The King's Landing stuff was decent.
Â 
Weakest of the season, but still a good episode.
173	shavedquaithe	2014-05-05	2/10
Consistently limp writing throughout. I still can't believe how relentlessly awkward every single interaction was. Total crippling disappointment.
174	Lord_Dustin	2014-05-05	I gave the episode a 7 out of 10.
I really enjoyed the development of Cersei's character.  This episode has underscored just what she is willing to sacrifice to see Tyrion found guilty during the trial.  Headey was brilliant once again, I particularly enjoyed the scene she shared with Pedro Pascal's Oberyn.  
The scenes set in the Vale of Arryn were incredibly compelling to watch.  The scene where Lysa gives Sansa lemon cakes was made the highlight of the episode for me.  A very well framed and tight scene beautifully imagined by Michelle MacLaren.
I also enjoyed the developing relationship between Pod and Brienne.  Both of these characters involved serious character development during this episode.  The relationship is clearly in a different place at the end of the episode to where it was at the beginning.
The episode does have a number of downsides too.  The one that is bothering me the most is the scenes between Arya and the Hound.  While I cannot deny that the dialogue between the two of them is quite funny, I just feel that the scenes don't serve much of a purpose.  We don't learn anything about either character, it seems more like an excuse to info dump Braavos again before it appears next week.
Emilia Clarke is not delivering the same powerhouse performances as she used to.  She was the weakest link in her scene.  She can't come across as aloof and passionate at the same time.  That being said, the show delivers once again in terms of that beautiful set.
175	thejakiss	2014-05-05	Giving the ep a solid 9, I coulden't believe how quick it went. The Jon Aryn reveal, the fight, Karl and Locks death took me by surprise, I really enjoyed it.
176	Mark Antony	2014-05-05	8.5 rounded to a 9. Maybe a bit generous. I felt episodes 1,2,4,and 5 were all very close rating wise with 3 being the weakest thus far this season. 
Overall after 5 episodes I'm a bit dissapointed, I felt like this season was gonna be the best since season 1 but its pretty much the same quality as 2 and 3 imo good but not great.
177	Sun	2014-05-05	6Â 
Â 
When did Cersie become an expert political maneuverer, manipulating judges left, right, and centre?Â 
Â 
How does Pod go his entire life in a horse and mule society and not know how to sit a horse? I'm not saying he has to be an expert rider, but sitting a horse is rudimentary.
Â 
Why would Lysa accost LF with Jon Arryn the minute he walks through her door? I know she wants to pressure him into marriage because she's threatened by Sansa, but why the minute he walks in? It's so unnatural and awkward behaviour.Â 
Â 
Why were LF and Sansa walking to the gate? Are there no trail horses, mules or donkeys in the Vale?
Â 
Why didn't Bran take the opportunity to warg Hodor and free them before the Locke moment? It's been established by the show, tonight no less, that the mutineers are mostly drunk 24/7 and that they felt safe enough not to have their camp, or Bran and co. guarded.Â 
Â 
Also, Why did the show kill Locke? What was the point of taking him to the Wall just to kill him so pointlessly?

178	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-05	6. I was bored throughout most of it. Too many solo 'character A has a conversation with character B' scenes.
Â 
Loved the ending at Craster's though. And Arya and the Hound were awesome as usual.
179	Antoinetta	2014-05-05	Oh, yes. I forgot about Pod's special  talent.
180	Antoinetta	2014-05-05	Another part i like: Jon reuniting with Ghost. The love between a man his dog.. well, a wolf.. but loyal like a dog.
181	Ran	2014-05-05	252 votes in, 7.49 average, 8 median, 7.59 normalized average.
182	The hairy bear	2014-05-05	I was torn between a 7 and an 8. The part in the Vale certainly deserved the 8, as did Cersei's conversation with Oberyn. I didn't enjoyed the other parts as much, though. Today I was feeling generous, so an 8 it is.
Â 
So far, my ratings had been: 7, 8, 5 and 6. *
Â 
*As I alway say, it'd be cool if everyone shared their past votes in the season and not only the current episode, to give persepective. It's very different a 10 from a a poster who has voted every season's episode a 9 or a 10, than a 10 from someone who was giving sixes or sevens.
183	boojam	2014-05-05	..... Mace Tyrell who's actually THERE and has hardly been used at all despite being played by a distinguished actor; couldn't he have at least been a part of the conversation? -- to subtly, more or less, influence them on Tyrion's trial.It's passing odd D&D were quite pleased about getting Roger Ashton-Griffiths and I don't think he's had more that two sentences.Odd.I also noticed, at least I think I did, either a stand in or a maybe a visual cameo by Dianna Rigg , hard to tell, for Olenna, would not minded having seen Rigg get one last parting scene.

184	gmavridis	2014-05-05	No, it's was at the last chapter of ASOS, right before the epilogue. Lysa is already dead in AFFC.


Â 
That is right. The last chapter in ASOS is when we learn about all the plotting Littlefinger did with the help of Lysa and when he shoves her through the Moon Door.
185	BlackTalon	2014-05-05	Gave it 5/10. So much clunky, wooden expository dialogue. I can't remember the last episode that was that bad in this aspect. Enough mention of the Iron Bank already please ...
186	gmavridis	2014-05-05	I gave the episode a solid 8. It was a good episode and I like that at least they avoided the complications Jon's and Bran's meeting would have had.
187	AnotherCrannogman	2014-05-05	7. It was fine.
188	Modesty Lannister	2014-05-05	NORTH: I'm usually not a purist when it comes to creating alternative plot lines in the show. Hence, I had high hopes for Locke and his new arc. So, this was anti-climatic. Why on Earth was he introduced into the NW plot-line only to be killed in the next episode? So, that was badly done.
Another northern irrationality in this episode was Jon's behaviour at Craster's keep. He never even asked the women if Bran and his group were there? So, he suspected Bran could be there, but he never asked. Also, after burning the CK none of the brothers of the NW gathered any intelligence from the women. Lame. However, Carl's death was awesome. Jon/Ghost reunion could have been more emotional. Bran the killer! A very interesting development there.
Â 
DAENERYS: What the hell is going on with Emilia Clarke's acting? Does she have a speech impediment and has to say everything so artificially and in such a slow pace?
Â 
THE VALE: The plot there was too rushed. Way too rushed. And a lot of foreshadowing in this and the previous episodes. The Moongate scene was too obviously filmed in the same gorge where we met the Thenns, so not a good work there. And I expected Lysa to change after her wedding night. I would have liked to see the Fingers. I liked Sweetrobin though.
Â 
KING'S LANDING: It was difficult to follow all invented plot-lines. Show Cersei differs so much from the book Cersei and, try as I might, I can see no point in that. Suddenly, Tywin and Cersei are on the same page in everything. What about what we saw last season? Another not so logical development. OK. One could argue she wants to sway all the judges, but still ... Lannisters have no golden cow to milk? That's an important novelty. Ties well with the introduction of the Iron Bank, but I am not sure how cannon is that. I have to trust D&D on this. Still no Kattleblacks. Why? And pls do not say it's a budget thing. They kept Locke in for half a season for no reason.
Â 
BRIENNE/POD: Funny filler.
Â 
ARYA/HOUND: Pointless filer. We know all the points they made. No need to hammer them again.
Â 
I love this show and I hope this trend does not continue. 5/10 (the worst mark I've ever given).

Â 
not BAD, but not especially good either.
Â 
Â 
extra point for Aryas water dancing and a half point for the state of her hair.
190	boojam	2014-05-05	The Casterly Rock thing is for the show. No danger of the mines running out in the novels. The reason Tywin doesn't just buy the crown out all its debts in the books is that there _are_ limits to how much wealth he has on hand (he's already a substantial debt holder as it is) and he's not going to cripple the house by tying up all of its wealth with the crown. The reason Cersei doesn't do the same is likely in emulation of that, with the added bonus that she well-and-truly believes that she can tell the Iron Bank to go hang.I might be misremembering but seems , in the books, we don't have in quantitative knowledge about Casterly Rock's mines.I always figured mines running or not they had a 'Fort Knox' type of deal and drew on that, but we don't have any knowledge of that either.I think you are right , it's kind of fuzzy , Tywin has the means but does not want to bankrupt the Lannisters.I remember vaguely that House Tyrells' wealth is from having a large taxable population.They have a large 'middle class'? Doesn't anybody get wealth in Westeros by trade commerce?The Iron Bank of Braavos again!We even go there this season.I don't think it's a spoiler because GRRM has brought the IB into play in the story already, but they start to seem be a bigger player more early on the show's story.
191	WITCHKING	2014-05-05	1.This is the worst season ever...
192	sifth	2014-05-05	The Casterly Rock thing is for the show. No danger of the mines running out in the novels.

Â 
So in other words, what your saying is she's insane. Is there a reason why so many people seem to be mentioning The Iron Bank on the show. From what I recall, we don't really hear much about these guys until A Feast for Crows.
193	dbunting	2014-05-05	I gave it an 8, some of it was a little slow. Did not like Cersei / Marg conversation, just felt out of place. You can however see how Cersei is trying to "play nice" with everyone so she can get what she wants, Tyrion dead!Vale seemed fine to me, except the very first spot where the soldiers are all ready to kill them. I mean if LF was there recently they should know who he is since Lyssa loves him so much. Liked Lyssa scene with Sansa, and is it just me or was Lyssa hair darker before, like a lot darker?Crasters keep.... I would have preferred Jon and Bran met but Bran was able to show Jon why he has to keep going. Definitely figured on Bran skinchanging Hodor, nice Boss kill!
194	AnotherCrannogman	2014-05-05	Moving way too fast and to hard to follow.  They are doing way too much each episode and this one of the worst. I need to watch again just to follow it.
195	TheEvilKing	2014-05-05	Gave it a 7. Everything was pretty good.
Â 
I was hoping we'd catch up with the Boltons and/or Yara this ep.
196	tallTale	2014-05-05	I rated this episode a 6. Not sure why but the show feels like it's losing its momentum with these last two.
I'm positive now that hbo will carry the show for only two more seasons, so basically next season will explode with spoilers and set the stage for the end.
197	Cyvasse Khal	2014-05-05	Damn. 5/10 for me. This season has been about struggling to string together consecutive great episodes. So many things fell very flat this episode. But as always I'll start with the positives:
Â 
Positives
- Lysa/Sansa: Lysa was just as unhinged as i hoped she would be. The reason i really enjoyed that scene was how good Sophie played it though. From finally feeling almost as ease, to being put on the back foot, to panic, to the final shot of her sobbing where you can just see she is thinking "i'm not sure i'm any better off here". Great acting.
- Cersei: I liked how we saw pretty much all sides of her tonight. Sensible Cersei keeping her Tyrell enemy close, Clueless Cersei despite being in power for 20 years not knowing how anything is run and being schooled by Tywin, and Mother Cersei showing genuine concern for Myrcella.
- Pod/Brienne: I think they got the intended outcome right here. Brienne thinks Pod is useless and should go, Pod casually explains through his Blackwater story that his loyalty means he will do anything for his Lord/Knight. Respect from Brienne.
Â 
Negatives
- Dany/Jorah: Emilia's delivery in the same way every time is really starting to annoy me. Also, guess Jorah isn't going anywhere any time soon?
- Hound/Arya: Their scenes just screamed out that D&D have nothing left for these two until they part ways. Nothing new added at all with their screen time. Also, The Hounds make-up looked terrible! His burns were a weird yellow colour and looked so much faker than it ever has.
- Craster's: So many things wrong here. Even the Unsullied knew Night's Watch would prevail, and they treated that battle just that way. The show has no idea how to show 'the sight', Jojen's visions were messy. They've wasted Bran warging Hodor to fight now, would have been much better if they used that for when they have to fight wights(if that still happens). So much promise they could have had with the Locke character, now he's gone.
- Lysa/LF: I know it played that way in the books, but, gross.
198	Fevre River Warrior	2014-05-05	Maybe because I have read all of the books multiple times this episode was the one I enjoyed the most this season (well, after seeing Joffrey die). Maybe for non-book readers it was harder to follow. I already posted my vote (a 10) and cannot believe all of the negative reviews here. This episode moved things along nicely and the Iron Bank is going to play a major role in the future so they have to keep mentioning it so people know the power it holds.
Â 
I am reading these reviews and shaking my head; I think this has been the best season of the show so far. I wonder if the difference it that it is harder for unsullied to follow since they have not read the books. Whatever, I guess we all have our own opinons.........
199	MarcusLloydAK	2014-05-05	I thoroughly enjoyed the episode. Really strong one imo. Obviously the Vale and Sansa was the standout scenes!! Really hope Lysa doesn't die in episode 7!
200	Ran	2014-05-05	291 votes, 7.47 average, 8 median, 7.55 normalized average.
201	Ser Graymax	2014-05-05	Now thats a little more like it.Â  Pacing was a little better as was the dialog and acting except of course for Emilia.Â  (Does she REALLY think she is the star of the show and a REAL Queen?)Â  Im in with an 8.
Â 
I also now have higher hopes for the confrontation between The Mountain and The Viper.Â  After the nonchalant way they presented the dispatching of the Champion of the City I was quite concerned.Â  Karls demise allayed that fear.
Â 
Line of the episode goes to The Hound again. What he said about Meryn Trant was classic IMHO.
202	doghouse	2014-05-05	I gave this episode a 9.Â 
Â 
I agree that some of the dialogue was awkward but we saw true storyline progression as well as some big scenes to wrap things up.Â 
Â 
I love that Robin is just as annoying as he was in Season One. The Littlefinger-Lysa scenes are as nasty and rotten as I expected them to be and the Jon Arryn reveal is huge.Â 
Â 
The Dany scenes show how she really isn't ready to control a kingdom yet.Â 
Â 
The Craster's Keep scenes wrapped that story up nicely with some great comeuppance moments.Â 
Â 
I am not a fan of the Stannis or Iron Islands stories so not having them on the show was a huge bonus. May have given this a better score if Tyrion was featured.Â
203	Lord Oldpants	2014-05-05	I think this episode was really good and for me, the best thing was that we could remember some things that happened before, almost every scene had some review of what happened before
204	The Drunkard	2014-05-05	Thought it was a bit boring. 6.
Â 
The parts I thought I wouldn't like coming into the season, Sansa/Lysa/Petyr and Bran/Jojen/Meera/Hodor, are the parts I enjoyed most, weirdly enough.
205	Robin Of House Hill	2014-05-05	9/10. Â Some slow spots, but so emotionally satisfying, by the end.
206	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-05-05	I usually try not to be negative about this show so I'll just say it was my least favorite episode this season and maybe of all 4 seasons. It was just kind of blah. Â I did enjoy the action at the end and I enjoyed Pod and Brienne even though those scenes did absolutely nothing to move the story forward. I have mixed feelings about the Eyrie stuff, but did find Lysa and Sweetrobin sufficiently creepy and disturbing.
Â 
I'm also just not sure what they are doing with Dany's storyline. Â I'd like to see more Jorah. He's barely had any lines this season and there's been no real development of Daario as a character. Â I do like what they've done with Grey Worm though - they've struck gold with that actor. Â I need to figure out what his name is.Â 

					
					
							Edited by Mother of Mini Dragons, 05 May 2014 - 08:01 AM.
207	RhaenysBalerion	2014-05-05	Meh. 7.Â 
The whole episode felt like a big filler. Nothing really happened. Just talking and talking and talking and more talking. Sometimes it did make me laugh, other times I was just bored. It was an overall, "Oh, it's already over? But nothing happened yet!" feeling.Â 
Â 
And I also feel like they are writing scenes for the actors and not the characters or the story. Lena Headey and Pedro Pascal are very cool and Lena Headey and Charles Dance are very cool too, but what exactly was the point of these scenes? Balon Greyjoy is still alive, Lady Stoneheart nowhere, Iron Banker nowhere, there's so much stuff yet to happen, but we are in this casual slow motion mode.Â 
Â 
Well, Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams shined this episode at least.Â
208	lightbringer333	2014-05-05	This is the worst. Bran stuff is real creepy. 
I mean why bran waited so long to warg into hodor. He could have killed all mutineer alone in d crasters keep. 
Noone would have found it out even if he had warged into karl to kill all mutineer. There was no reason for bran to rot in inside craster keep.
GOT is really getting boring now. It wuld have made much sense if they had followed  books. Now so many flaws n loopholes beyond d wall.
And again writing n dialogues r ordinary except for all kings landing n arya scenes.
I was expecting jojen as very mature character but d writing for bran n jojen was ordinary. David n dan need to need to improve.
209	aFeastForDragons	2014-05-05	6/10
Â 
Crasters was awesome but it was ultimately pointless. Locke dying was a waste. The fight between Karl and Jon was awesome. They have portrayed Jon very badly so this was a sorely needed scene.
Â 
Lena Heady was amazing this episode.
Â 
The stuff with Jojen was weird. They should really introduce Coldhands if they want supernatural scenes that look like they are from LOTR.
Â 
The Dany scene was alright. Not sure why they have her a Navy when thats the point of the Ironborn. Also randomly adding in now that she left a council in charge of Astapor is terrible writing. They really need someone in charge to peace everything together instead abruptly making new plots.
210	The Killer Snark	2014-05-05	I'm deciding to play Devil's Advocate and I'm giving this one a slightly reserved 9. it's the third slowie in a row, but it's a big step up from last week's deviation ridden patch-fest, which spent its entire second half going nowhere fast at The Wall. I gave that episode 8, with caveats, but the pacing in the Northern scenes at times was frankly geriatric. The structure in this was far better, and the non-book dialogue and extra-source scenes were more sensitive and better judged. I thought the Margaery/Cersei, Cersei/Oberyn and Eyrie scenes were excellent. The writers were right to move the Petyr/Alayne story arc directly there instead of first heading to the Fingers, because it cuts down on scenes which to non-readers would seem like padding. I do have some minor reservations re: the progressing humanisation of everyone's favourite pantomime fruitloop Cersei, who at times seems positively well intentioned. Rather than force her monstrousness on us all at once when she becomes Regent, the writers appear intent on cutting a lot of what she gets up to in AFfC out completely by making Tommen King in this series, when in the books he's not yet of age. So this will effectively reduce her merely to anti-Tyrell paranoia, which of course is a big mistake. I'm trying not to let that worry me at present. I'm not sure where they're going with the fact she's agreed reluctantly to marry Loras. I'm still aggrieved at the elision of Gregor. But the episode was strong enough overall as to make me look forward to the next episodes once again. The book-deviating diversion at Craster's Keep, which I'd first thought would amount to mere padding, actually turned out well, even though the death of Locke (and Vargo gets it far worse in the novels) leaves everyone no wiser what on Earth the character was doing at The Wall.

211	Legend	2014-05-05	I have been dubious about the past two episodes and honestly thought this was a refreshing change and one of the best of the new season. I disliked the addition of the Craster's Keep storyline but I loved how it was resolved here and I'm finding Jon Snow more of a badass each week. I love the Podrick/Brienne scenes and the Lysa/Sansa scene was incredible. Not to mention The Hound on top form as always.Â 
8/10
212	The Monkey	2014-05-05	7/10 - A bit slow, and the dialogue wasn't as sharp as it could have been. Still, I enjoyed the Lysa scenes very much, and Arya's water dancing.Â 
Â 
Massive blueballs @ the Craster's Keep sequence. Jon and Bran could've met and talked, there's one book deviation I wouldn't have minded. And at hindsight, the whole thing seemed like filler.
213	Jslay427	2014-05-05	Jojens burning hand vision made wonder about Coldhands. Will there be an epic battle between Hothands and Coldhands?
214	Gvn2Fly	2014-05-05	I gave it a 4. Â I think this was my least favorite episode of the entire show. Â I loved last week's episode so this just seemed like a huge difference. Â I wasn't really interested in anything happening and the conversations in KL were boring.
215	rmholt	2014-05-05	6/10

The Dany scene was alright. Not sure why they have her a Navy when thats the point of the Ironborn. Also randomly adding in now that she left a council in charge of Astapor is terrible writing. They really need someone in charge to peace everything together instead abruptly making new plots.

Did anyone notice the Meereen navy had 93 ships? IIRC that's the count of Victarion's initial fleet. Definitely an intriguing add-in. G-d only knows where that's going.
216	Sand11751	2014-05-05	7 out of 10. Too slow and plodding. I liked the Jon Arryn reveal and if I never hear Lysa having sex again in this show, I will never complain again! One big problem with the ep - who is this woman Lena Headey is playing? When has Cersei ever asked an enemy for help; she even let the sister dig from Marg go after promising last season to have her strangled in her sleep for it. Then she gets all misty-eyed talking about Myrcella w/ Oberyn? Even he gave her the WTF look. Cersei is all about showing power, never weakness. If any of her enemies don't see through that act, they deserve what they get. Â

217	AnotherCrannogman	2014-05-05	Lysa Arryn was the highlight.  Perfectly acted all the way.
218	A Redeemed Hound	2014-05-05	Gave it a 7.Â  Far better than the turd of last week.Â  It's okay to not have tons of action every week.Â  So the simpletons can go smoke a pipe.Â  Love the Pod/Brienne; Hound/Arya; and Sansa/Lysa moments.Â  All great.Â  Sweet Robin is such a creepy little kid.Â  If he was nursing again when we saw them last night I would have given the episode a 9 easily.Â  Hodor unchained was fun.Â  Been very eager to read something like that in the books.Â  Pod burning the rabbit was classic.Â  A little humor does wonders for this normally-bleak show.
Â 
The only stupid thing was Jon's reunion with Ghost...since he never seemed to realize or care that his giant beast of a wolf was MIA in the first place.
Â 
And I assume they will take a lot of liberties with Dany since we are already in her Book 5 situation.Â  And book 5 Dany basicallyÂ nibbles on figs forÂ most of the first 3/4.
Â 
It also would have been nice to hear Jojen say "Because today is not the day I die."Â  Give the readers something to geek over.

219	Turinqui-Calima	2014-05-05	I gave it a 4 - It was boring and had some infuriating parts, mostly Cersei being Cersei (except in the Margeary scene when she was someone else), Littlefinger's tardiness at telling Sansa to bring her hood up and too much Brienne and Pod. Littlefinger's acting was horrid as usual and I wish Emilia Clarke would do something other than 'mighty teenage queen' once in a while, especially when it's a one and oneÂ conversationÂ with Jorah. I know she can, because she did in season 1 and 2.
Â 
Lysa of course was brilliant and Sweet Robin did very well. The end was not great story-wise but at least it was entertaining. Ninja turtle Burn Gorman, including his death, had be pretty excited. All in all, better than last weeks episode.
220	tricky92	2014-05-05	Show only people have to be confounded as fuck.


Â 

I can assure you, we're not.
221	Gvn2Fly	2014-05-05	I think Emilia Clarke has been awful this season. Â Her scenes are starting to make me cringe. Â
222	Ser Lawrence	2014-05-05	Sorry for any duplication... I have to get to work sometime today, so I didn't read every preceding post.
Â 
But, I can't see how this is the worst episode of the four seasons, or how it was all pointless.Â  While it may have been understated or subtle, there was a ton of stuff for both book-readers and Unsullied.
Â 
Cercie is not being nice, she's trying to manipulate the judges.Â  She's holding the "Queen-ship" over the Tyrell's heads so Mace will judge her way.
Â 
We got the Jon Arryn "murder mystery" solved (the main reason Ned went to King's Landing in the first place, other than his devotion to his friend, Robert).
Â 
Sansa is out of the frying pan and jumped right into the fire!
Â 
The Unsullied don't know if Oberyn is truly sated by Tywin's peace offering (writing poetry), or what.
Â 
Jon isÂ one of the few trueÂ "good-guys", so we know that ain't going to end well if every other "good" character's fate is any indication.
Â 
Dany is going to get side-tracked in the goings-on of Slaver's Bay, and we know what happens to those cities she "liberates" once she leaves.Â  (As Tywin put it, conquering is not the same as ruling.)
Â 
As a book-reader, I was surprised by Locke's fate.Â  I was sure he would be a part of the ending of ADWD.
Â 
Lysa screaming... and did Robin throw the "beautiful present" out the moon door?!?
Â 
I too only gave this a 7 rating, but a king can't die every episode.Â  However,Â I would argue that this episode was jam-packed.
Â 
Enjoying this season as a wholeÂ the most, so far.
223	tricky92	2014-05-05	Â Lysa is already dead in AFFC.

Isn't it?
226	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-05	NORTH: I'm usually not a purist when it comes to creating alternative plot lines in the show. Hence, I had high hopes for Locke and his new arc. So, this was anti-climatic. Why on Earth was he introduced into the NW plot-line only to be killed in the next episode? So, that was badly done.
Another northern irrationality in this episode was Jon's behaviour at Craster's keep. He never even asked the women if Bran and his group were there? So, he suspected Bran could be there, but he never asked. Also, after burning the CK none of the brothers of the NW gathered any intelligence from the women. Lame. However, Carl's death was awesome. Jon/Ghost reunion could have been more emotional. Bran the killer! A very interesting development there.
Â 
DAENERYS: What the hell is going on with Emilia Clarke's acting? Does she have a speech impediment and has to say everything so artificially and in such a slow pace?
Â 
THE VALE: The plot there was too rushed. Way too rushed. And a lot of foreshadowing in this and the previous episodes. The Moongate scene was too obviously filmed in the same gorge where we met the Thenns, so not a good work there. And I expected Lysa to change after her wedding night. I would have liked to see the Fingers. I liked Sweetrobin though.
Â 
KING'S LANDING: It was difficult to follow all invented plot-lines. Show Cersei differs so much from the book Cersei and, try as I might, I can see no point in that. Suddenly, Tywin and Cersei are on the same page in everything. What about what we saw last season? Another not so logical development. OK. One could argue she wants to sway all the judges, but still ... Lannisters have no golden cow to milk? That's an important novelty. Ties well with the introduction of the Iron Bank, but I am not sure how cannon is that. I have to trust D&D on this. Still no Kattleblacks. Why? And pls do not say it's a budget thing. They kept Locke in for half a season for no reason.
Â 
BRIENNE/POD: Funny filler.
Â 
ARYA/HOUND: Pointless filer. We know all the points they made. No need to hammer them again.
Â 
I love this show and I hope this trend does not continue. 5/10 (the worst mark I've ever given).


Â 
I don't get why people keep saying this?
Â 
How could Jon have known Bran was at Craster's? No one told him andÂ he didn't evenÂ see him there?
Â 
Jon knew Bran had gone North, not at Craster's.Â Although, I do find it odd that Karl neverÂ taunted Jon with capturing Bran during their duel.

227	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-05-05	I give this episode a 5/10.
This is my second lowest rating this season so far, tying with the Jaime-Cersei rape scene. I am really disappointed with this season. I hope the remaining episodes are a lot better than what we've seen so far. There have been some stand-out scenes, but there have been even more "bad" scenes in my opinion.
Keeping it positive, I loved the Vale scenes. Sweetrobin is just how I imagined him to be. The tension between Sansa and Lysa was palpable. Great acting by all, and nicely written as well.
Rory McCann gets the greatest lines in the show. I think he personifies the Hound perfectly, and I love that they're keeping him longer. This is one of the (few!) changes I really enjoy.
Pod and Brienne was amusing as ever. I'm glad that the show got a few laughs out of me last night. Comic relief is good.
I hated ALL of the Cersei scenes, she is very out-of-character here, which I attribute to bad writing and not bad acting - Lena Headey is a terrific Cersei. No Stannis and very little Daenerys, just more invented scenes. I had written in a thread for the last episode that Bran-Jon would be a miss, and I wasn't disappointed at all... but I hate the entire thing that is going on at Craster's - fluff and filler isn't my style.
Usually, I watch the episodes twice and then come to the forums to discuss.. last night I simply went to bed.
228	Braun is the man	2014-05-05	I gave the episode an 8 because we finally got the Jon arryn info and the Starks had their most positive episode since Ned was around. Bran gaining control of Hodor to annihilate Locke was intriguing. Dany's struggle with liberation is important because she sees the big picture rather than forcing her way to westeros ill-equipped. I wish they would have showed Dario taking the Myranese navy. All in all, I don't understand how some of you guys felt this was a bad episode.
229	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-05	Â 
Isn't it?


Â 
I got a buddy who's lost as all hell, but he deserves it so I don't pity him. Most of my show-watching friends are still treading water, they just gotta bear with all the non-action scenes.Â
230	Lady of Dragonstone	2014-05-05	does make me laugh how book readers want the show to be more subtle, so when they subtly show cersei influencing the jury they get mad because they dont understand lol.


Â 
What YOU don't understand is that book Cersei would never do this. She is not a subtle person, and she isn't going to kiss the ass of the Martells and Tyrells to get the sentencing that she wants. Cersei doesn't give a shit what they think. She is the Queen.
Â 
PS: I don't "want" the show to be "more subtle" in fact I don't even care about that. The best scenes in this show are when things are explained outright ie: Lysa and LF murdering Jon Arryn. Since you seem to know what book readers think why don't you try picking one up?

Â 
I usually have to watch each episode twice to make sure I pick up on all of the dialogue, but overall it's not very hard to follow. It's not calculus :-)
Â 
To be honest, I'm glad I never read the books so I can truly enjoy the show as it's own entity. Plus, I have too many books in my queue as it is.
232	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-05-05	Cersei was working the judges to make them vote against Tyrion. She wasn't trying to be friendly. People complain when the show isn't subtle, but when it is subtle, they don't get it hahaya like there was no personal agenda involving her convo with oberyn.  Like seriously if people dont get that she is just scheming the hell out of everyone including her father then I dont know what else people would want d&d to do? She is doing it all for her cause. She is getting people to sympathize.
233	Bar Keep	2014-05-05	The Locke stuff in this episode was poorly done. Â First he uses his ninja stealth skills to find exactly where they are keeping the kids. Then he decides to grab Bran and make a run for it? What was his end game here, take him out to the woods and kill him? If he was going to do that he should have just did it in the tent. His other option would be to take Bran back to the Dreadfort which would have been impossible to do alone.
Â 
He also leaves Hodor & Co. alive so they can tell the NW exactly what happened.Â 
Â 
As mentioned above Jon went there looking for Bran but didn't bother to ask anyone if they had seen him.
Â 
I doubt mind the show wanting to add some of their own side story lines but it need to put effort into it.

Show viewers dont have that perspective.  Therefore, they have to do things like this to inform the viewer of what she is really trying to accomplish. In the books there were some actions that she took that were out of character but her POVs let the reader know why she did them.  You dont have that luxury with a show.

Â 
I completely agree, which is why I'm not sure why I was attacked for my review. I have a different perspective than others who only watch the show. In fact, any and all fans have different perspectives of the show and the book. I never said she was not trying to manipulate the judges, only that I thought it was out of character and I did not like it. More power to anyone who enjoyed it. I can fully understand context clues. Trust me, "I GET IT"

Yeah and you figure Craters Women would have mentioned the captives being held in the shed/tentÂ  Â  you know before Jon burned it down and shit and one of them was Brandon Stark. They had to remember Jon from the last time he was there and when the dire wolf showed and made nice nice with him it should have been a dead giveaway that they were kin.
237	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-05	Positive
The Eerie Eirie - Didn't mind the Jon Arryn resolution. Lysa isn't going to have many more opportunities for that info dump. It was also refreshing to have someone besides Baelish give an info dump on the Baelish machinations. Lysa and Robin suitably deranged.
Cersei/Tywin - Really liked the scene but have a few reservations (Power balance between Tywin and Cersei, Lannisters suddenly bankrupt - would have been more believable to say 'The war has stopped all gold for over a year')
The Dog and the Wolf - Definite plus. Beric and Thoros is justified in show canon and is no doubt a foreshadowing of their reappearance.
Lysa/Sansa - Yep. Crazy level just hit '11'.
Cersei/Oberyn - solid scene and a satisfying amount of backstory/info
Crasters - I quite liked this sequence but it falls short of being 'excellent'. I was a little underwhelmed by the fighting and the whole 'Bran sees Jon but decides to leave'. The second point worked at Queenscrown but didn't work here. Otherwise it generally resolved the filler material quite well - apart from the Locke storyline. The way that was truncated was, in the words of the great man "A shameful fucking performance." Only just scrapes a '+ve'
Â 
Â 
Negative
Meereen - The whole thing was just 'off'. Jorah not pressing for a departure? The "How can I rule 7 Kingdoms if I can't rule Slaver's Bay" line was different from the trailer wasn't it? "If I can't rule 1 city" The line was delivered after a quick cut to behind her so I can't help thinking it was a post-production edit. Her whole plan has been to 'Conquer Slavers Bay'? When was that ever demonstrated? She left governors in charge at Astapor? When was that explained? There was just so much WTF with this scene. Also, as others have mentioned, the ships Daario has taken suggests that Victarion's story may be cut. I will reserve judgement but am disappointed.
Jojen's visions - I quite liked it and found it interesting.
Â 
Â 
Neutral
Cersei/Marg - On the face of it a good scene, but the exchange flies in the face of book Cersei's character so much I was unable to be immersed in the scene. Did they recast Headey into a new role?
Bloody Gate - Problematic geography but allowed for an info dump on the Vale.
Pod/Brienne - 'OK' but just 'OK'
Â 
All up it wasn't fantastic but not too bad either. I think when I do a S4 rewatch this Ep might earn an 8 but I just can't really give it that at the moment. Its almost there but not quite. So 7 it is.
Â 
Ep1: 8- Ep2: 8+ Ep3: 7 Ep4: 7+ Ep5: 7+
238	Bonifer Tasty	2014-05-05	I gave it a 9, but maybe should have given it an 8. Â 
Â 
For me, they start at 10 (I LOVE THIS STORY!), then I downtick for things I don't like, and uptick for thinks I really like. Â 
Â 
Downticks this time: Lysa Arryn's too quick reveal of Jon Arryn's murder (didn't mind it being in this episode, just thought it was hard to notice with enough attention); Tywin saying they were out of gold for three years (don't buy it!); Olenna being gone from KL; and Lysa Arryn telling Sweetrobin show Sansa was and that she killed Jon Arryn. Â Just plain stupid!
Â 
Upticks: Oberyn' saying he has 8 daughters (YES! Â Don't want any cutting out of characters like they did with teh Tyrells!); Hound and Arya talking about Syrio, playing with audience on whether he could be alive or not (fun!); successful resolution of Craster Keep plot, I hated it last week, but it turned out alright.
239	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-05	I gave it a 7 (because of the Vale and Craster scenes)
Â 
In comparison to the other episodes it just seemed to be missing something? Although, I think the Craster's keep businessÂ was over-hyped (particularly Locke) and that didn't help.
Â 
what I liked-
Â 
The 'Oh shit' face from Littlefinger as Lysa comes in with a septon and Sansa's 'urgh' expression at hearingÂ her screams.
Â 
Jon vs Karl- I love how they didn't go with the 'hero mops the floor with theÂ bad guy' approach to make Jon look like a bamf. It was nice seeing one of the girls get their revenge and showed Jon to be a hero in another way- actually caring about the daughters/wives.Â 
Â 
Jon/Bran nearÂ miss- I usually moan about Stark 'almost encounters' but they handled this one really well. BranÂ staring longingly at Jon, wanting to see his brother but knowing his duty is elsewhere. Having himÂ make the choice notÂ to reunite withÂ JonÂ was allotÂ better than a cruel twist of fate scenario and added to his character development. It really empathised the parallels between Jon and Bran atÂ having to put their duty before their love/family.Â 
Â 
Arya adding Walder Frey to her list. 
Â 
"I've missed you boy" 
Â 
Besides from the Craster's keep and Vale scenes the rest was just 'meh' but still good.
Â 
what I didn't like-
Â 
Cersei being manipulative and having a good reason for refusing to pay the Iron Bank- I know allot of people like Cersei being more cunning and sympathetic as opposed to her villainousÂ book personaÂ but I love dumb bitch Cersei, she is funny but still dangerous.
Â 
Locke- As much as I love the irony behind Bran being the one to kill the man who crippled the man who crippled him (lots of twisted karma!) I think his death was underwhelming.
Â 
Most impressive acting of the episode for me- Sophie Turner (Sansa) during the Cray Cray Aunt scene and Thomas Brodie-Sangster (Jojen) being all wisely creepy! I could literally feel Sansa's building panic with the tears gathering in her eyes andÂ got goose bumps at the dark look from Jojen as he said "I saw you die tonight." Very impressive!

240	DolorousKim	2014-05-05	I was overall still entertained by this week's episode, but it was to me the weakest of this season so far.Â  I tend to favor character development moments over scenes that just serve to move the plot forward, and while this week did have many of said character moments, some of them just didn't deliver in the manner that I've grown accustomed to with this show. Â  I gave it a 6: not bad, but not great either.
Â 
What worked for me:
Crazy Lysa with both Peter and Sansa - Kate Dickie is delivering one hell of a performance!Â  She's so convincing when bringing the crazy that it makes me a tad physically anxious to the point of nearly being uncomfortable to watch her.Â  Now that's acting!
Arya - Hound scenes - I love the dynamic between these two.Â  I disagree with the notion that their scenes this week had no point.Â  To me, the scenes really drove home the fact that these two, while having a grudging respect for each other, are not allies.Â  Loved the way that Arya casually turned her back on the Hound before uttering his name as the last on her list.Â  As if to say that she had no reason to fear him, and also let him know that she hadn't forgiven nor forgotten his murder of her friend.Â  Loved the look of panic on the Hound's face when he woke up to find Arya missing.Â  Every scene with Maisie and Rory together is something I treasure.Â  Extra bonus points for the extremely cool to watch "waterdancing."
Brienne - Pod - wonderful character and relationship building moments between these two.Â  Their scenes were funny, touching, and awkward as hell all at the same time.Â  Perfectly realized and portrayed to my mind.
What didn't work for me:
Dany - Jorah - I don't think that Emilia Clarke is a bad actress overall: sometimes she totally nails Daenerys, particularly in moments where she's required to show some vulnerability.Â  This week, unfortunately, was certainly not one of her better moments...Â  What a stinker of a scene, her line delivery was completely and bizarrely off.Â  The only saving grace was Iain Glen's performance as Jorah.Â  Nice to see that they finally remembered his character still existed and he actually got a few lines.Â  For someone who is supposed to be Dany's most trusted adviser and staunchest ally, he's been little more than a glorified extra this season.Â  What a waste!
Cersei - everyone - This is not the Cersei that I've come to know and loathe/love.Â  I understand what they were going for, as far as having her character trying to influence the judges in Tyrion's trial, however, it came off as being a totally out of character move for Cersei to have embarked upon, and a ridiculously transparent attempt at manipulation at that.Â  Total thumbs down from me, not for the acting, but for the entire stupid premise.Â 
Peter - Sansa's walk into the Vale - This scene rang totally false and seemed to serve merely as an excuse to film some impressive shots of the Bloody Gate.Â  If Littlefinger is supposedly so damn clever, why is he letting Sansa proceed so long into her march into the Vale with her Tully hair on full display?Â  What happened to the horses/mules?Â  It seems utterly ridiculous that Lord Baelish would be walking so far on foot when he's supposed to be at this point a fairly powerful man qualified to win the hand of LadyÂ  Arryn in marriage.Â 
Â 
The action scenes at Craster's were pretty well acted and realized, but these scenes posed nothing unexpected beyond Locke's death.Â  Bran's warging of Hodor was well done and suitably creepy, as was Jojen's delivery of his prophecy of Karl's death, but there ultimately wasn't much in the way of suspense here, was there?Â  I mean, was anyone really expecting the mutineers to carry the day?Â  Not a bad conclusion to the episode, but not exactly revelatory either.
241	A Redeemed Hound	2014-05-05	Anyone else think Emelia Clark is a far better actor when she is not speaking English?
242	graaf_x	2014-05-05	9
Â 
Liked:
Â 
Every line from Hound's mouth is pure gold.
Â 
Crazy aunt is beautifully crazy.
Â 
Not a fan of new Daario, but his part made me laugh in an otherwise weak storyline.
Â 
All about Jojen.
Â 
Bran and Co part as a whole (you can burn me as infidel, I don't care)
Â 
Not so much:
Â 
Locke's abrupt death. Come on, he deserved more time.
Â 
Daenerys storyline. At least they are now putting it to the beginning of the ep.Â
243	gotgrrrl	2014-05-05	I gave this episode an 8/10 -- seems like even so-so episodes have something that redeems it for me.Â  Last week it was Ser Pounce, this week Arya's water dancing and mention of Syrio Forel!Â  My daughter fences and although she can't watch the show for obvious reasons, I do pick out scenes of Arya's sword-skills for inspiration that she can watch.Â  This week was just amazing.Â  I think the Hound's dismissal of water dancing is going to come back to bite him (at least I hope so, I was not happy when he smacked Arya). Â 
Â 
I wasn't crazy about Cercei's portrayal.Â  I get that she's trying to sway the judges but I think she'd be acting a bit more unhinged -- she was too calm and "normal".Â 
Â 
Dany's scene was just meh.Â 
Â 
I liked that one of Craster's wives/daughters got a chance to stab Karl (in retribution for the abuse) and essentially save Jon.
Â 
Ya gotta just love Tommen
244	tito5601	2014-05-05	i expected the gruesome scene to be way more disturbing than a sword thru karl mouth
245	King Tyrion I	2014-05-05	8/10.
Â 
It was alright.
Â 
I liked:
Â 
- Pod and Brienne
- the inauguration
- the scenes in the Vale
- Oberyn and Cersei
- Tywin and Cersei
- the fight at Craster's
- Bran and his "gang".
Â 
I was a bit disappointed in that scene with Danaerys.
Â 
EDith adds her say: And I liked Arya and The Hound.

Â 
I am one of the nitpickers regarding Sansa's use of "virgin" though. Â So we've got "kill the masters" in english, Olenna saying "all the rage!", virgin vs. maiden.... what's next, Dora the Explorer popping up when Dany yells dracarys? "Say it again! Dra-car-ys!
Â 
I mean c'mon, I think most people watching the show know how to figure out maiden means virgin within the context. Â Little things like that are what make the show awesome.
Â 
ETA: Also pretty sure maiden has been used several times already? In reference to Marg most likely.

The Good:
- The Eyrie scenes.Â  My wife, the non-book reader, had the reaction I hoped for upon hearing the Jon Arryn reveal! Although, I didn't think it wasn't going to be revealed until ep. 7.Â 
- Casters Keep:Â  Was worried about them veering the Bran/Jon story line off the rails after last weeks ep. but its back on track.Â  It did give us a nice visualization of Bran making that decision between reuniting with Jon or continuing the mission.Â  Also, Hodor's possesion, although predictable, was still good to see happen. His disgust after being let go and seeing the blood on his hands was noteworthy too.
- Liked the unexpected twist with the interaction between Margery and Cersei.
Â 
The Bad:
- No scenes I truly disliked.Â  The rest filler but good filler with character development.
251	The Killer Snark	2014-05-05	I happen to agree with the book-reading slant against our current genius-of-manipulation, Cersei. Lena Headey is excellent, and I'm not downgrading the episode because I really enjoyed all her scenes in it. But let's get it straight: book Cersei is an idiot. She is, like, truly superstupid, and transparently insane,. Her cosying up to Oberyn is actually in character, because the Martells dislike the Tyrells and it's the better alliance she's been offered by her father in the novels considering Loras being a Tyrell and being unquestionably gay. Among the wondrous prospects she gets given in the novels are marriage to either Balon or Theon Greyjoy, despite the fact that neither has yet been asked. In the novels and the series, Oberyn is someone Cersei has no personal prejudice against, and apart from the fact he's not a Robert-style drunkard, he's intelligent, and also an attractive man. It's Oberyn himself who has no interest in the arrangement, which Cersei is perfectly content with, because he sees it rightly as a sweetener to stop him pursuing justice against Tywin, Gregor and anyone else involved in the death of his sister. The writers are quite rightly explicating material that happens offscreen in the books.
Â 
Her subtlety in attempting to manipulate others strikes a somewhat false note in line with the fact the Cersei we know and laugh at is not a very intelligent person, whose motives are always easy to read. I really feel that the writers have been reluctant to have too much of book Cersei's character on display in order to placate PC-style feminists who have already complained about Martin's purported bias against female leader figures in the novels (based on Cersei, but ignoring the fact that Dany is one of the most able leaders in the series), so they're not trying to go too far down that road. But it is a bit frustrating, especially since it gives them less to work on with the AFfC adaptation. The consistent zaniness of her chapters is by some distance the most interesting thing in that book.

252	WhatIsDeadMayNeverLive	2014-05-05	What's wrong with you guys? It was the second best episode of the season.
253	I love Cersei	2014-05-05	Beautiful episode, again nothing that really bothered me (much). Liked each scene and interaction. Especially Arya/Hound and the Eyrie.
Â 
And I even don't know whether I like show Dany or book Dany more any longer. That is about the greatest compliment I can give to the show, since I love the books.
Â 
The writers clearly have different ideas about some characters (Cersei a lot this episode), but I can't really expect them to see everything like I do.
Â 
All in all, it was a very strong episode especially because it was good without interruption: 9/10.Â Not a 10 because there was no killer moment like in: big thing happened, or: really emotional thing happened. Kind of like an LP from which you like to listen to every song, you don't want to skip one, but no single one stands out either. Over the years, that are the albums I listen to most often.

257	Daenor	2014-05-05	I rate with an 8 cause i generally enjoyed it.As others have mentioned it was a somewhat predictable episode.If you look at other posts you'll see that a lot of people predicted Hodor's warging and the almost there reunion of the Starks
Now to my complains
First of all the whole Jon knows thing and the part of Locke were completely unnecessary.They made that huge change with Sam spitting it all out, they send Locke up the Wall for what reason?So he may grab Bran and start running???What was the point of that?Most reasonable thing would have been to slit the throats of all 4 right there.Since the Starks didn't reunite anyway,Jon could have well been unaware of Bran's presence beyond the wall.And maybe Locke could have been replaced from one mutineer like Rast,for instance.It would make more sense for him or any other of the bad guys to grab Jon's brother and run when things went awfully bad for them,so that he could use him as a bargaining chip in case they find him.Also didn't all this bunch of women there realize that the mutineers had some people captured?The most reasonable thing again would have been to have a line of "Hey sir Crow there are some poor fellows captured" or something like that.This IMO is a proof that the butterfly effect is not a very good thing cause than you need to create plotholes andÂ  in order to fix the crap you brought up out of your mind.

258	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-05-05	I'm not sure how I feel about this episode yet! Â Love/hate feeling so far.
Â 
I am one of the nitpickers regarding Sansa's use of "virgin" though. Â So we've got "kill the masters" in english, Olenna saying "all the rage!", virgin vs. maiden.... what's next, Dora the Explorer popping up when Dany yells dracarys? "Say it again! Dra-car-ys!
Â 
I mean c'mon, I think most people watching the show know how to figure out maiden means virgin within the context. Â Little things like that are what make the show awesome.
Â 
ETA: Also pretty sure maiden has been used several times already? In reference to Marg most likely.


Â 
What are you talking about? GRRM even uses the term virgin a few times, interchangeably with maiden. This is a textbook case of complaining about nothing.

 I concurÂ
262	Seneti	2014-05-05	8/10 It was a really good episode and it would have been great if it hadn't been for a few minor points:
- Robin knows about Sansa?
- Dany being cringe-worthily bland
- a little too much time spent in KL

I thought the same thing.Â  How exactly was Locke going to escape with Bran considering he can't walk and has to be carried around by Hodor?Â  And if Locke were to go missing, wouldn't that raise suspicions among Jon and Co?Â  What exactly was Locke's plan?Â  To drag Bran all the way back to Bolton?Â  And if we assume that Locke also kills Hodor, Jojen and Meera, wouldn't their bodies be found the Jon and Co.?Â  The whole thing makes no sense to me.Â
266	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-05	Locke could have slit all their throats and everyone would have thought it was the mutineers. Could have sauntered back to Castle Black with the rest of them and been gone riding for the Dreadfort the next day.Â
267	Daenor	2014-05-05	Locke could have slit all their throats and everyone would have thought it was the mutineers. Could have sauntered back to Castle Black with the rest of them and been gone riding for the Dreadfort the next day.Â 


My thoughts too.Except that the writers also had him "warn" Jon to avoid that specific hut and obviously the dead bodies there would have pinpoint him as the killer.So with this "brilliant" trick they justify the fact that Locke had to run away.Now where would he go it's a completely different matter.The whole plan doesn't seem to have been the brightest

268	Steve Stark	2014-05-05	I enjoyed it, but it wasn't the best episode and didn't keep up with all the others which is to be expected. Doesn't deserve an 8 or 9, but it is good television. Got a 7 from me.
Â 
My biggest personal complaints are that Jon should have split that dude in half, straight through his two blades and into his skull. Show the value of that sword, please. Plus, Jon is no slacker with the sword. I'm glad the one girl/victim/craster's wife got her revenge, but I'd have rather Jon taken him out.
Â 
I had a feeling he was going to warg into Hodor, but the scene was a little forced/sloppy. I had a feeling they were going to make sure Jon and Bran did not see each other, but this was....I don't know, just sloppy.
Â 
Lady Arryn's jealousy was pretty fun to watch. And LF's awkward disgust toward Lady Arryn. Too bad boy Robin Arryn doesn't get to see his mommy fly...

Â 
Well, this was a directional masterpiece. There were moments when I felt like looking at a Lord of the Rings illustration by Alan Lee. It was an episode that established so much without being boring or dragging and interpreted certain book moments incredibly. I loved the Eyrie scenes, Kate Dickie was stunning, as was Sophie Turner. The final showdown at Craster's was done very well, considering they had to finish some characters' story lines and move the plot forward (even if it was very different from what happened in the books). There were subtleties that set up the characters and plot for episodes that can be expected next season, what I consider to be a great decision (Daenerys', Cersei's and Oberyn's scenes).
Â 
Top-notch acting, great photography and exceptional directing made this episode for me.
Â 
Â 
Episodes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5:Â Â  7;10;8;9;10/10.
270	Petyr Patter	2014-05-05	I almost swore I was going to stop watching the show during the tail end of this episode.Â  Depictions of rape make me ill.Â  And I will give the show some credit, by turning Jaime and Cersei's encounter in the sept into an unambiguous rape scene, I now think all bets are off when it comes to show versus book.Â  When Karl entered the hutch, I was in fear I was about to bear witness to another rape scene.Â  I literally put the DVR on pause and got up to do some things around the house before sitting back down and grinding it out.Â  I found what happened next well rewarding.Â  Bad guys die, Bran takes action, and the blood on Hodor's hands is excellent "show, not tell" for the loss of innocence or something.
Â 
Beyond that, I think the episode was Sophie Turner's best performance to date.Â  She does tears very well.Â  The transition she goes through from thinking she's found family and safety, to realizing her aunt loves/fears/hates her, an innocent man is going to die (Tyrion), and she is being forced into another marriage was a great scene.Â  Of course, Lysa Arryn does even more to sell that scene, I am very glad they got the same actress back.Â  Altogether, the Vale was great, including the visual depiction of the Bloody Gate.Â  This makes no sense with the geography of Westeros, but still looked cool.Â 
Â 
However, on the other side of the world, Emilia Clarke gave her worst performance to date.Â  I honestly think she was on drugs when her scenes were filmed.Â  The close ups on her face showed bored bemusement.Â  She just found out her work in ending slavery in two cities has been reversed.Â  How does she respond when alone with her oldest and most trusted councilor?Â  Annoyance.Â  "Things aren't going to plan?Â  What a bother, I guess I must be a queen and rule here."
Â 
Contrast her to Lena Headley, who gave some very interesting scenes.Â  Cersei appears to be acting the grown up.Â  She makes her peace with Margaery, and spends time bonding with Oberyn over the one thing they have in common, daughters.Â  She also appears to stop fighting her marriage to Loras.Â  I am sure on one level it is an act.Â  On the otherhand, Cersei thinks she can better secure her objectives by working with people than against them.Â 
Â 
Finally, I loved Tommen's coronation scene.Â  I half expected a Tommen to just keel over and die the moment the Septon said "long may he reign."Â  However, it had all the pomp and circumstance a coronation should have.Â  The hall was packed full.Â  Everyone was wearing their best clothes.Â  The King's Guard stood in attendance with their fancy armor.Â  Two lines of ceremonial goldcloaks.Â  Tommen looking scared that he might screw up having a crown put on his head.Â 
Â 
9/10
271	harokin	2014-05-05	Very solid episode, and a step up from last week's, which was more of an ok/goodish ep.
Â 
-Seeing the Eyrie was great, and they did well with Lysa. I can imagine the reactions from the Unsullied going from "Aww, it's nice to see her among family again!" to "Oh right, this was the crazy lady".
Â 
-Cersei scenes were good as well. She's been pretty evil this season so far, so it was good to show some whitewashing to contrast it.  I was expecting ultimate bitchiness especially with Marg, so it's nice to see they don't always take the obvious route.
Â 
-I think this was the first episode not to feature Tyrion?
272	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-05-05	Sry but Cersei and Marg saying to each other they both knew Joff was an asshole and then Cersei telling Marg that Tommen is going to need a politically savvy strong queen when they are supposed to be enemies is just straight bs. The way Locke was supposed to kill Bran for Bolton but starts to carry him off before Hodor kills him is dumb. Why do that when he could've just cut all their throats and blamed it on the mutineers. The only thing that saved the episode was the funny oh petyr which I'm glad they kept and Karl showing up pretty boy Kit, though Jon Snow should've owned him, in Cqc I can see why 2 knives are better than a bastard sword.

Â 
I don't have digital copies unfortunately, but I've read through the books twice. Â Which is enough to know that virgin is used, but not the way Sansa used it, and nowhere near as often as maiden.
Â 
I think a highborn girl saying she's a virgin sounds ridiculous. Â She'd say I'm a maiden.
Â 
Is it a big deal? Â No not really. Â It stood out to me though, especially following the other phrases I mentioned in my OC. Â Plus other posters mentioned it was most likely changed so viewers wouldn't be confused, which I sincerely doubt would happen. Â I just hope this isn't a trend that's going to continue, I'd be disappointed. Â I enjoy getting lost in the story, and it's the little things like saying "maiden" instead of virgin, or "seven hells" instead of jesus christ, that encourage it. Â The show has been fine in that respect up until this season.

Â The biggest problem w/ that theory is he left the Reeds behind. Unless Jon and Co lost, they would know that someone took off w/ Bran, and at least one of the NW would be able to track him down, not only for taking Bran, but for deserting the NW. It doesn't seem like a good idea. His only real choice would have been to kill them all, and then let the blame fall on Karl and his boys.

Because Brienne and Pod are in the books. The difference is that Show Pod is older than Book Pod so it comes off as much more awkward.
299	The Killer Snark	2014-05-06	Ice and Fire - Most of this stuff is actually necessary to plotting, though. From looking at the episode titles of this season, it's obvious the writers are focussing all of the really important moments towards the second half of it. Arya and the Hound and Brienne and Pod are both long-running odd-couple partnerships in the books.

300	Ice_and_Fire	2014-05-06	I know those couples exist in the books, they just go so obvious with that take on the relationship. It is so on the nose with his many mishaps with the riding of the horse, cooking the rabbit. To me it just sticks out massively as them feeling the need to put some comic relief in, so they go OTT with it.Â
301	House Lunny	2014-05-06	i actually really liked this episde. The first 40 minutes had a slower pace than other episdoes but thats what I liked about it.
302	Metopheles	2014-05-06	"Ah'm a true croh, and ah'm Ned Staark's sohn. Prepare t' meet tha death. ... No, please don't hurt me...eek!"
303	Victorian Beckoy	2014-05-06	I gave it a 7, thanks to great performances by Dickie, Taylor and the focking legend.Shame the last two kicked the bucket, too soon I think.
Couple of things:
- Why does Locke need to spy and learn the numbers, when Edd and Green, as former prisoners, should already know how many mutineers there are? Moreover, wouldn't they know if there were any hounds chained in the hut? Locke's risking too much here.
- On-screen, Jon alone killed at least ten of the mutineers. No way could there have been eleven of them.

304	Corvinus	2014-05-06	8/10 because I was feeling generous, but it could go as low as 6/10.
305	Niamhikus	2014-05-06	i think the last two episodes were absolute crap. in fact if the next episode is crap i wont be watching the series anymore.
306	DrownedSnow	2014-05-06	Â 
No, Jon was at a disadvantage with his longsword. In a tight quarters fight like that you'd want shorter weapons.


Â 
Â 
Tight quarters? Did you see how much room they had? No way.
307	DrownedSnow	2014-05-06	i think the last two episodes were absolute crap. in fact if the next episode is crap i wont be watching the series anymore.


Â 
Last episode was pretty crappy but this one really didn't have any serious problems. I'll never understand how some people can hate an episode so entirely when nearly everyone else agrees it was a great episode. I could understand you being lukewarm but not outright hate. Care to explain your opinion?
308	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-06	Â 
Â 
Tight quarters? Did you see how much room they had? No way.


Â 
Yeah, Jon was outclassed. Karl was too easily able to close the gap and negate Jon's range.

Gave it a 7, myself. The stuff beyond the Wall kind of ended in a whimper, while the King's Landing stuff highlighted how much softer and less compelling I find Cersei on the show. That said, folks, Cersei was not just being nice -- she was working on each of the three judges -- and it says something about the way the show-runners have decided to do things, that Margaery is the obvious stand-in for the judges rather than, you know, Mace Tyrell who's actually THERE and has hardly been used at all despite being played by a distinguished actor; couldn't he have at least been a part of the conversation? -- to subtly, more or less, influence them on Tyrion's trial.
Â 
Kate Dickie is fantastic, though, and the Arya-Hound stuff was pretty good, I thought. Oh, and whether it's spoilery or not, I thought Thomas Brodie-Sangster's performance as Jojen touched on Bran's destiny and his own fate suitably creepy; well performed, on his part, and well-written by the writers. I do think they missed some opportunities with the Night's Watch attack on Craster's, though, and maybe finished up using Locke too quickly.


Â 
I was shocked about Locke as well. Although the crackpot in me is not 100% convinced they are done with him. Sometimes the dead walk beyond the wall. I never saw his body burned.

Give Jon some credit. He definitely burned him.
312	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-05-06	Gave it a 7. Solid, as all GoT episodes should be, but nothing outstanding.

314	Hard Hugh	2014-05-06	Overall i thought this was a great episode. I was fairly concerned how they were going to get the Bran and Jons plots back and I thought they did an exellent job tying it together.
I really enjoyed the Sansa and Lysa interaction. Great performance for both actresses.
I also really liked the Cersi/Margery interaction. I thought it matched the characters as parellels a bit more and set up the conflict.

	Spoiler 
Things I still wonder....When will Jon show any warging ability?
How on earth will they do Jorah's betrayal?
315	King Redbeard I	2014-05-06	I loved this episode. Much more exciting than the last two, in my opinion. The fight scene between Jon and Karl was fun, loved the sword through the head, and the reunite with Ghost.
Â 
As someone who's only just finished reading the books I feel a bit lost especially with all the changes they've made (Vargo/Locke, who I was actually kind of gutted for when he died, I was starting to like him, even if he was a bad guy).
Â 
I gave it a 10 because it's the only one that's got me pumped up other than episode 2.

316	Three sisters	2014-05-06	Well, I give it 8. A 7 because it's a solid episode, and +1 because I hoped that Jon would meet Bran, and they didn't meet (so they kinda stick to the story line in the books).
Â 
The Eyrie was breathtaking too.
317	MizasterJ	2014-05-06	My thoughts onÂ Game of ThronesÂ season 4 episode 5
Â 
Contains no spoilers if you've seen the episode.
Â 
Â This episode, even though it had dynamic , entertaining action near the end, I felt that the actual plot was uneventful. This midway point in the series is either a calm before the storm or a slumping low point in story before major uphill arcs. Â I was bothered by the lack of significance here, it was mostly just a lot of talking for the sake of talking.

Â 
However, it was the standard quality acting that we've come to expect from the series.Â 
Where is Varys this hole time, why has he been absent like this entire season? Are they gearing him up for something big? I can't imagine they are.
Â 
I was really hoping to see Theon & Ramsay reach Moat Caitlin this time, not sure why they are delaying that, or even Arya get on the ship, but we are denied both those occurrences in favor of..just banter.
Â 
Funny how HBO spared us actually seeing Lysa and Petyr knocking it, while they make sure to show us details of the more glamourus people screwing. lol vanity?
Â 
The highlight of the episode was defintely seeing Hodor snap chains and snap a neck, while Jon snow battled a ruthless killer. Excellent sword fight. I can't help but feel a little disappointed that Jon wasn't able to beat Karl on his own. He still has a ways to go in terms of fighting skill. However, it was satisfying to see Karl skewered like that, and to see Ghost get his just desserts.
Â 
The subplot with Vargo/Locke came to a weak and abrupt end. Jon didn't even get to discover his treachery, leaving us to ask what was the point? Maybe Roose Bolton will grow impatient and send others to find out what happened to his hunter? Â Yet , I doubt it. Â Would have been much better had they included a conflict between Jon and Locke; a reason for them to pursue one another, but with the massive war at the wall coming I guess the show runners don't have time ( or patience?)Â 
Â 
Cersei seeking out an ally in Oberyn is rather odd. A complete 180 from the book where Oberyn favors Tyrion. No doubt this will turn around though. Â I believe this scene was simply just to remind viewers that the Â Martell's have Cersei's only daughter, which will become very important (in season 5?, 6? or 7?) Â lol.Â Where the heck is Varys? spying on them I hope.Dany: Â this is the point where most fans start moan and groan. Brace yourself, hateful comments and condescending remarks from fans about Danerys are coming.Â 
Â 
Â 
You must give her credit, she sees things through. The girl's got resolve. But will HBO be able to atone for the infamously loathed "Mereen saga" ? Â 
Â 
-Review by Sblackjack@comcast.net-

Â
318	Hodor's Dragon	2014-05-06	I'd give it an 8.5, but I voted 9. Â I might've over-voted in reaction to seeing a bunch of people in this thread dogging the episode in a way that was really undeserved in my view.
Â 
They'reÂ really upping the game this year. Â And it's not just that the budgets are bigger. Â The writing and direction are really crisp.
Â 
The first couple of years this show really didn't have all that much for people who had read the books. Â Some good nudity, a well-down battle of the Blackwater, decent sets, but the main thing that hooked in the numbers was the rockin' plot, and if you'd read the books you knew the plot because there were few deviations. Â Other than going over the top a bit with sex and gore, it was pretty much traditional TV, with the GOT characters largely being shoehorned into TV stereotypes. Â (Often they fit well, because of course GRRM's background is largely TV.)
Â 
3rd season the show was a little better, with a few really excellently-done scenes. Â But this year it has blossomed. Â This is excellent TV that deserves to be compared with what I consider the classics of the recent TV renaissance: The Sopranos, The Wire, Rome, etc.
Â 
As for this episode, I loved it til we got to the North. Â No, Cersei isn't being inexplicably nice, she's trying to get Tyrion put to death, but those scenes were written in a way that softens Cersei's character a bit - as it was in the book, where you get a good luck at what makes Cersei be the way she is. Â Lena Headey wsa excellent
Â 
The scenes in the Vale were fantastic, especially the "hand-holding" scene and Sansa listening to Lysa's howling. Â A couple of really nice moments in the Arya-Hound scene, too.
Â 
Daenerys' scene didn't work all that well, but it's set-up, and the same can be said for Brienne and Pod. Â The directors have over-done the queenly badass conquerer bit for Daenerys, they need to bring back more of the scared, emotional girl with enough inner strength to get by that lives in the books.
Â 
I might've been inclined to give this episode a 10, but the North bits left me flat. Â I'm not a big action fan, but I can appreciate good action; that wasn't it, neither the big fight outside nor the duel inside. Â The part at the end where everybody is toasting marshmallows by Craster's burning house just made no sense at all, and Bran deciding not to reveal himself to Jon was set up poorly and just reeked of viewer-teasing. Â The only bit of that whole scene I really liked was Hodor's reaction to realizing how he had been used. Â Oh, and the "fight" between Ghost and Rast.
Â 
Â
319	iliasb	2014-05-06	weak ep:
Â 
Brienne and pod stupid.
Jojen, wtf?
Disappointed in Oberyn, why you do this? He's awesome
Already revealing jon arryn...
320	Adam_Up_Bxtch	2014-05-06	I liked the episode, gotta say like everyone the ending was way better, Karl was a good little villain for a while, liked him because I'm a fan of Burn Gorman so I'm sad to see him go, Karl Tanner.....not so much, probably was killed in the best way possible.....ya know because he was a "Fookin Legend" i'll give it an 8. Also weird that Daenerys JUST got word of Joffrey's death, since it happened like 3 episodes ago.....guess word travels VERY slowly

321	Rhaegar I Targaryen	2014-05-06	weak ep:
Â 
Brienne and pod stupid.
Jojen, wtf?
Disappointed in Oberyn, why you do this? He's awesome
Already revealing jon arryn...


Â 
I thought the Jojen stuff was pretty cool, I agree on Brienne and Pod though I did get a chuckle out of Pod (not as much as in Oathkeeper when they first showed him standing there all smiles, happy to be a squire again  )
Â 
Oberyn I was alright with, Jon Arryn reveal I was a little uneasy about but not the biggest deal in the world.Â 
Â 
WIth Jojen in particular, I think they needed to generate more interest in his character and his abilities. My show watching friends were all uninterested in him before that episode. Â
322	The Killer Snark	2014-05-06	MizasterJ - Oberyn still does favour Tyrion, but they're showing something that actually happens offscreen in the novels, Tywin's attempt to foist Cersei off on Oberyn if it means he'll stop whatever plans he has against the Lannisters: plus Cersei's acquiescence in the scheme, and Oberyn deciding that although he'd like a threesome featuring Cersei and Ellaria, he sees through what the Lannisters are up to and still decides to help out Tyrion. He understands that part of the reason he's being offered the Cerster as wife is because The Mountain is set as her champion, and to forestall him taking Tyrion's side in the trial.
323	Inevittable	2014-05-06	Some bits seemed very 6 (Dany, Pod/Brienne, Cersei/Margaery) and some bits seemed very 8 (Lysa/Sansa, Cersei/Oberon, Arya/Hound) so I've gone for a compromise at 7.
Â 
I'm glad that I've read the books so I understand why Dany doesn't want to go to Westeros right away, I'm sure I'd be lost without that because it seemed like such a snap decision on screen.
Â 
While I didn't like the Cersei/Margaery scene, I did like Cersei with the Viper. Â "Everywhere in the world they hurt little girls" - one of my favorite lines so far on the show.
324	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-06	I liked the episode, gotta say like everyone the ending was way better, Karl was a good little villain for a while, liked him because I'm a fan of Burn Gorman so I'm sad to see him go, Karl Tanner.....not so much, probably was killed in the best way possible.....ya know because he was a "Fookin Legend" i'll give it an 8. Also weird that Daenerys JUST got word of Joffrey's death, since it happened like 3 episodes ago.....guess word travels VERY slowly


Â 
Tyrion's trail was set for 'a fortnight' from when Pod visited him. I think it safe to assume that Pod's visit was very soon after he was imprisoned (a couple of days). The fact Dany knew within two weeks of his death actually suggests word travels VERY quickly.
325	Miss Carnahan	2014-05-06	7
Â 
It was okay (really liked the Eyrie stuff and Brienne & Pod), but it wasn't great.
326	Count Balerion	2014-05-06	Episode 5: I ended up giving this a 7.Â  None of the segments was as bad as the crypt scene in episode 3, but none was as good as Tywin/Tommen in the same episode; so it averaged out the same.Â  I find the stuff invented for the show to be rather hit or miss; and the episode seemed to me to have too much whispering.
I did find the Vale segment quite well done, however; particularly Lysa switching between being kind to Sansa and becoming insanely jealous.Â  I prefer Martin's timing of the bombshell about JA's murder.Â  Not fussed about niece vs.Â  bastard, but Donald Duck did come to mind. Â 
Daenerys was also pretty good, albeit rather rushed.Â  She appears to be very well informed about events in Westeros, though.
	Spoiler Did the news come from SJ, indicating that he still has contacts in
Westeros? Are they going to have him revealed as an informer after all?

Those were the highlights.Â  I guess there weren't any screaming lowlights, as such.Â  I did wonder why Westeros seemed so unscathed, even bucolic.Â  And OB bonding with Cersei and forgetting to be sarcastic?Â  Now that I mention it, Cersei and Margaery are getting along pretty well too; of course they're not supposed to be openly hostile yet, but wasn't Cersei nasty to Margaery just a few episodes ago when the latter presumed to call her sister?Â  For some reason, the Tywin scene didn't grab me as much as one would have expected, either.Â  Anyway, that's enough nitpicking for now.
327	StrollofShame	2014-05-06	Not sure what your "nonsense" refers to, but if it's about the LF being behind everything big reveal, it should really have been left for way later in the season (ideally ep.10) :Â  in the books it marks a milestone in plot advancement (arguably the biggest reveal at that point), here it will just be overlooked and probably forgotten by most Unsullied.
Plus, this means Only Cat in ep.7, and I happen to very much like that scene, was hoping they would keep it for ep.10.

I read on another thread that quite possibly, the reveal was done early EXACTLY SO the Unsullied would hear it loudly & clearly, & not have to recall it among the MANY more exciting reveals which will captivate all of us in the season final. I don't recall which genius poster said it, but that made enormous sense to me. My Unsullied BF will remember it now, & not have to try to recall it later, when his head will be exploding from the season end action. It may be rendered less important if combined with other events which will shock far more greatly. Kudos to the originator of this splendid theory!
328	StrollofShame	2014-05-06	And definitely a solid 8 rating from me, for "subtle" Cersei (Lena trying not to KILL Margaery for calling her 'Sis' or 'Mum' was exquisite--the lump Cersei swallowed must have been enormous!), for loony Lysa and her wicked talons nearly drawing blood from Sansa's hands, for Arya Needling (& being needled by) the Hound, & for the poignant, lingering looks given to Jon by his little brother, before Bran steels himself to forge on.
329	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2014-05-06	I gave this one an 8. Â A recap episode but nevertheless with much to admire and enjoy. Â Lena Headey is doing sterling work this year. Â I was slightly underwhelmed by the Jon Arryn reveal, but I am sure that is because in the books it was such a WOW moment and I'd never even suspected it. Â However, the scene between Kate Dickie and Sophie Turner was intense and a joy to watch - if only to see how far Sophie has come since Season 1. Â She paced her descent into fear perfectly throughout mad Lysa's speech. Â 
Â 
I'm sure I'm not alone, however, in being slightly disappointed that the show have killed off Locke. Â I realise that as soon as he became involved in the added Bran story, his days were numbered, but I think he would have added an extra dimension of tension at the Wall for Jon in future episodes. Â I guess we'll just have to make do with Sir Alliser and Janos. Â Get ready, Edd.......
Â 
Yep, nothing much to complain about. Â A few pacing issues with the Hound/Arya and Brienne/Pod scenes being sort of 'thrown in' just so we could keep up with them, but as I enjoy both couples I wasn't too distraught.
Â 
ETA: Â Longclaw searing through Karl's mouth was effin' awesome!

330	ground_control	2014-05-06	3 of 10 -- A bit better than last week, but the same major problems dragging it down -- weak Dany/Mereen scene, and the North scene was brutally horrible (although fortunately only 15 or so minutes this week instead of last weeks 20). Â My issue isn't that the material isn't in the books, it's that these scenes were so utterly horrible -- bad writing, bad acting, bad directing. Â The North scenes were two long blobs of material that just screamed filler -- everything set up and resolved in two episodes. Â The assault on Craster's Keep did not look like 9 NW taking on 11 drunk deserters by surprise. Â And the special effects (Jojen's hand burning, Karl Silvertongue & corpse) were pretty cheesy -- seriously, I'd rate them as "on par" with 80's slasher movies (Friday the 13th, et al).
Â 
Hoping not to see the North again until Stannis shows up.
331	Goldfinger	2014-05-06	A mastermind.
SoÂ  "Where are my dragons!!!".
a 9
Â
332	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-06	If less time had been spent on the Craster's Keep nonsense and more time had been devoted to the things that actually matter, I probably would have given the episode a 9. But the Craster's Keep material and the extremely limited, rushed Meereen scene really brought it down some for me. So...8.
333	The brown snake	2014-05-07	6.5
Do NOT get:
Bran leaving before saying hi to Jon.
Forget about my homeland which is my right, I will rule some random city where the other cities are coming to get me.
"Where are my Dragons?" Have not seen Dragons since 1st episode.
Lysas odd 'wedding' wouldn't she want a massive wedding with at least her son and neice present?
No Greyjoys.
No Tryion
Â 
I did like:
Lysa being so nice to Sansa and she knew who she was and was like "of course I know who you are, oh my beautiful neice we are all going to live happy in this odd castle, you, me, my son who still feeds of me and the owner of the brothel" and of course she did a 360 in such crazy lady fashion.
Pod and Brienne of Tarth 'adventure'
Oberyn FINALLY mentioning his daughters
334	redriver	2014-05-07	I liked the episode, gotta say like everyone the ending was way better, Karl was a good little villain for a while, liked him because I'm a fan of Burn Gorman so I'm sad to see him go, Karl Tanner.....not so much, probably was killed in the best way possible.....ya know because he was a "Fookin Legend" i'll give it an 8.

Yep-like how long does it take to send a text to like Mereen or wherever?So totes fifteenth century.
335	Shebara	2014-05-07	solid stuff but nothing really breathtaking, gave it a 7
As could have been seen in every good crystal ball before, the Jon and Bran meeting did not take place (otherwise it would have been impossible for Bran to go further north and meet the 3eyed crow)
Interesting: Tywins revelation to Cersei that the Lannister gold wells have run dry and that she has to look for other gold wells (marry Loras) and be careful with the Iron bank
Scene I liked best: I like the couple Brienne and Pod...pretty funny!!
336	Pablosplinter	2014-05-07	I gave it a 6. better than the last few, as a few things got back on track and pointless characters were kileld off.
Â 
Have to give massive credit to the actors who played Sansa and Jojen as well. They were both awesome.
337	Conchobar	2014-05-07	I watched this episode a second and third time with my mother and then father and each time I enjoyed it more. I initially gave it a 7, now I feel it should be an 8.
338	Ran	2014-05-07	504 votes in, 7.39 average, 8 median, 7.49 normalized average.
339	Beric175	2014-05-07	9 for me.Â Not much to complain about from me. Yeah, the Jon stuff was filler-ish but it was short overall and we got a good payoff to Locke, Rast and qarl being dicks.Â I liked everything else a lot.
340	The Killer Snark	2014-05-07	I do agree that the North stuff should have been curtailed in this season in order to make more room for our beloved Khaleesi, Mother of Eyebrows, who has been getting some pretty short shrift of late, but these problems reached their definite head in last week's episode, where the North scenes went on for longer going nowhere without timing than a Saturday Night Live sketch. By getting them out the way fast here, this confirms my view that sometimes the right hand in the writer's department disapproves of what the left hand has been doing. Hence the rather perfunctory death of scene-filler Locke with his completely puzzling non-novels arc. They did this in the last season by getting rid of Roz when they realized they'd hit a dead end with an invented character. I actually quite liked Roz; she had a habit of getting nakey. In the case of chucking Locke out the window, if it turns out that no-one indeed had an idea what to do with him, I think his disappointing death by Hodor was probably for the best.

341	JagLover	2014-05-07	Rated it an 8
Â 
Scenes at the Eyrie were good and north of the wall.
Â 
Arya's scenes were OK.
Â 
Most of the rest felt like marking time.
342	missingm	2014-05-07	I gave it a 10. I love how the scenes are flowing much better this season. A couple of seasons ago it was a bit choppy.Â 
Â 
I guess the one drawback was how small the dire wolf looked when Jon crouched down to great it. They were looking huge in previous episodes.
Â 
As an "unsullied" I would have to tell the book readers to not worry about us so much. The story is flowing very well. I thought the Cersei and Margaery scene was great as it would have to be such an awkward conversation between the two, with M trying to avoid any break in decorum under threat of death and C just wanting to do away with the pleasantries and slap her. Cersei was an A+ in this episode.Â
343	Dragon Queen	2014-05-07	7. 
The bad-
Cersei's newfound ability to be nice to her enemies (Margaery especially). Where did she learn that sudden politeness?
The Wall-having read the books, it removed the tension of those scenes. I'm sure the Unsullied would find those scenes more exciting because of the suspense. 
Arya water dancing. Painful to watch. 
I usually love Daenerys, but the acting was off. Her scene felt melodramatic, like we were watching a soap opera. 
The good-
Lysa. All the Unsullied I know immediately recognized her, which was great considering the last time she appeared was season 1. Everything at the Vale was great and I liked everyone's acting. 
The Hound and all his dialogue. 
So far my ratings have been 9, 10, 9, 8, and now 7.
344	The Killer Snark	2014-05-07	9, 8, 10, 8 and 9 for me.
345	The Anti-Targ	2014-05-07	Much better episode. It didn't wow me but no major gripes either. 7/10
346	boojam	2014-05-08	Cersei's newfound ability to be nice to her enemies (Margaery especially). Where did she learn that sudden politeness?I have seen this criticism a lot.Especially in Cersei and Marge's exchange.To me both sound like crafty Machiavellians , subtly disingenuous.Politeness only a veneer.Same with Cersei's other exchanges.
					
					
							Edited by boojam, 08 May 2014 - 05:44 AM.
347	Talking Hodor	2014-05-08	7/10 Good episode, but nothing really big happened.
Â 
My only complains are all small ones, like Rast death (I know all the CGI budget goes to the dragons, but we deserved to see some direwolf badassery) or Dany scene feels to rushed again, like they could have explain her reason to stay a bit better, and how the hell the news of Joff's death arrive so fast LOLÂ Â 


Joff's death news would spread really fast.Â  I'm sure that was realistic.Â  Agreed, Rast deserved to die better than in a blur of fur.Â  At least show a limb getting bitten off!Â  Considering this is the most popular show on earth at the moment, you'd think they'd have a bigger CGI budget.Â  I sincerely hope this is pointing to them having a ridiculous amount of CGI medieval battling in the second half of the season.
348	Talking Hodor	2014-05-08	Sandor Clegane's developing Tourets syndrome.Â  He should be renamed Sandor Fucking Clegane.Â  Still his point about armor and big swords was entertaining.
Â 
I thought the episode was good.Â  I don't know why there are so many complaints.Â  For a non-book reader, the reveal about Jon Arryn must have been pretty sensational - finally realizing how dangerous Littlefinger is and how the Lannisters aren't quite as evil as everyone thinks.
Â 
Seeing Hodor Unchained was definitely awesome!Â  I just wish they'd have had him let off a HODOR roar in a fit of barely contained rage as he snapped through Locke's neck.Â  I'm also still waiting on Bran to warg into Hodor and then start talking normally.Â  That'd be trippy.
349	7th-key	2014-05-08	6.
Though my score is about the same, this ep it was better than the last two because it didn't have absolutely let down/WTFÂ  scenes.
Â 
I'm happy the Craster-ol'-houseÂ  arc was wrapped tidily. Nevertheless it was superfluous and predictable.
Â 
The scenes in the Vale gave the feeling of GoT returning to business. Lysa was great, though with nitpicking on the way Sansa is supposedly in incognito. "Sweetrobin, this is your cousin Sansa but when we're not alone don't call her that." - sounds a solid plan to only mention the name the kid should not use and not the name he should use.Â  The Jon Arryn reveal was underwhelming... it should have had a dramatic music cue: tan tan taaaan! ;P
Â 
Brienne/Pod cheesy writing. Oh look, Brienne can't untie a strap...
Â 
Last week I liked Jaime's tA©te A! tA©te scenes. This week, Cersei was doing the rounds. Her tone was unclear, I wouldn't expect her to pity herself around strangers, even if it's to butter up the judges. I thought it the wrong way to do it; admitting to Marge that Joffrey was a monster would actually make a judge more sympathetic toward the killer...
Â  Â 
Â 



Couple of things:
- Why does Locke need to spy and learn the numbers, when Edd and Green, as former prisoners, should already know how many mutineers there are? Moreover, wouldn't they know if there were any hounds chained in the hut? Locke's risking too much here.
Â 


Â 
This. And I've never heard Craster or the NW having hounds in the first place.
Â 
Somebody wondered about LF and Sansa walking up the mountain instaed of mules and horses. I guess it's a budget and animal security thing, the less they're used the better.Â
350	AnotherCrannogman	2014-05-08	Most of the new scenes and changes do not hold a candle to George's writing. This episode included. If they add stuff just make it sex and violence which is what hbo is good at
					
					
							Edited by AnotherCrannogman, 08 May 2014 - 08:47 AM.
351	Greywolf2375	2014-05-08	It's a 7 for me.Â  Crasters I thought was handled a little poorly - Bran's decisioning, the Snow fight. Hodors incredible healing skills; I liked much of the Vale but thought some things were a change for the poorer (niece v daughter, Robins relationship with LF)
Â 
I liked that Cersei was trying to play the game but was frankly see through in her efforts.
352	lightbringer333	2014-05-08	After hearing Lysas sex screams magister ilyrio masturbated in pentos.
353	The Blue Hysteria	2014-05-08	Better then last week!
I agree with a lot of people that the pacing this season has been noticeably better!
Cersei making the rounds on the judges was good; I like that she is trying to manipulate them but just getting worked over herself. Â Margery pissing her off with the "mother" comment, Â Tywin securing her participation in her marriage to Loras, Â Oberyn reminding her of Dorne's hold on her daughter. All good stuff and placed well throughout the episode. I just wish we could get some dialogue from Mace Tyrell! Maybe they're saving him for comic relief next episode at the trial.
Arya & The Hound stuff was good once again. Â The Hound's face/reaction when Arya stabbed him and he realized she really tried to gut him was great! He made her rethink her training and what makes the strongest warriors. Â I hope their split is coming soon though; very eager to see how it plays out in the show and their discourse is just starting to get a bit old.Â 
The Vale scenes stole the episode. Beautiful entrance shot at the bloody gate and the character dynamic between Lysa, Petyr and Sansa is super uncomfortable and unnerving. Â The true reveal of John Arynn's death was fine to me, I'm not sure how they could have done it any better. Â A very awkward re-introduction to the Vale gave it the right vibe considering where we're heading. Very good adaption from the books.
Brienne and Pod stuff was a bit cheese balls but necessary I suppose. Â I liked their dialogue. Â Brienne understands Podrick better now and has some respect for him after learning about the Blackwater. Â If their relationship evolves into more of a badass duo rather then a comic relief one I will be one happy Grumpkin. Â Like Arya and The Hound minus the one-liners and added mutual respect. Â  Ok..maybe a few one-liners. Â Weakest part of the episode for me, but that's not saying much.
Alright! The Craster's scene! Â Predictable as it was, I'm glad they did it that way and didn't fuck around with the story that bad. Locke's death was great! Certainly taking away some of the predictability of Bran's escape without contacting Jon. Loved the thought provoking foreshadowing with Jojen and Bran pre raid.
Two things that confused me:Â 
1. I forgot the Ghost was locked up!? When did that happen?Â 
2. How did Longclaw not swipe through those knives? Jon was just kicking major ass outside when Bran was spying him.Â 
I get that Jon "doesn't fight dirty" like Karl does, but come one, he must have picked up a trick or two with his time with the Wildlings. I dislike that Jon would have died had one of Craster's wives not been their for a good stabbing.Â 
I gave it an 8. Â 
Â
354	Panther2000	2014-05-09	I gave it a 8, pretty solid episode.Â Â Â  It had a bit of everything, Action, Character bldg., & lots of foundation laying for the rest of the season.Â Â Â Â Â  I do wish that we were able to see the Wolf brother's ( Ghost & Summer) reunion.Â  That would have been nice, they hadn't see each other since they were puppies..Â  I can't believe that we 5 shows away from waiting another yearÂ  this show to come back.Â Â Â Â Â  They really need to up the budget & season for this show.Â Â Â  Hell, other shows who don't have the Ratings of GOT or the acclaim get longer seasons.Â Â
355	AryaSansa	2014-05-09	So many plot holes in this episode!
Â 
Why did Jon leave without finding Rast?Â  Wasn't the purpose of the whole mission to prevent any mutineers from talking to the wildlings, not to mention to avenge the old commander's death?
Â 
Rast killed the old guy, and Jon doesn't know Ghost killed him.Â  So his mission should have been considered a failure!
Â 
Why didn't Locke just kill everyone while he had the chance?Â  Or did he plan on carrying Bran to the wall?Â  If he was trying to interrogate Bran, he should have done it while he was tied up!
Â 
Why isn't Dany worried about where her dragons are?
Â 
Little Finger telling Lysa to kill her husband and then telling Cat was totally unexpected.Â  It doesn't make sense, since Jon's investigatino of incest is now a coincidence.Â  Unless Cersei told Little Finger to kill Jon, but why would LF tell Lysa to tell Cat?Â  Cersei ordering LF to kill Jon seems like the best explanation I think.
Â 
Maybe Lysa didnt help Cat with Robb's war because Lysa was still jealous of Cat?
Â 
Also, why did Arya stab the Hound?Â  Did she really want to kill him?Â  Why did the Hound let her stab him?Â  A pointy thing can still hurt you through bendy armour, maybe not plate mail.Â  Why doesn't she just kill Hound next time they sleep?Â  If I were Hound, I would tie her up just in case!

Â 
Not a book reader, eh?
Â 
With regards to Jon not knowing about Rast, it's implied that he knows. It's a technique often used in film making.
Â 
I have no idea what Locke was going to do with Bran, but you don't really need to tie up a cripple. Also Rickon is still alive, and maybe Locke was going to ask Bran about that.
Â 
As to the rest, especially LF and Lysa, I suggest you read the books. LF is quite the clever fellow.
357	AryaSansa	2014-05-10	Oh another thing, if Bran was able to warg into Hodor, why didn't he do it sooner?Â  He could have saved them all!Â  There were times where no one was guarding them, as Locke found out.
Â 
Poor Locke, he was a good fellow.

Median = 9Over at Rotten Tomatoes ~40 critics on balance reviews give it a 'rating' of 10.At least all these reviews give , in most cases, an analysis, in some cases an extensive analysis.After watching the episode again, not clear , to me, why it worked out to be 1 point less than I estimate it at.I had given it a 10 but after reading this week's reactions I might subtract a point, but don't agree with the faults I have seen posted, so a puzzle as to why it did't wind up with a 9 or at minimum an average at 8.Oddly scored episode.O yes, for a lengthy review someone who is a reader Myles McNutt at Cultural Learnings is always a good read:http://cultural-lear...ame-of-thrones/

Locke wasn't tasked to kill everyone, or anyone. Neither Ramsay nor Aroose wanted Theon dead yet either. I can't recall if he was supposed to kill all Starks himself but he couldn't very well kill either Bran or Jon right there. If he killed them he would have had to kill all the rangers and the guys at Crasters and find someway to escape south or live north. And he didn't know where Rickon was.
The dragons are where she put them.
Arya's  tried and failed to kill him many times. Pretty sure she wasn't too surprised he was ready for her.

Â 
Poor Locke, he was a good fellow. 

It's hard. Books.
362	Valar Morghulis Not Today	2014-05-13	Episode suffered a little for me because I watched 406 straight after which I thought was incredible, but still thought it was a good solid episode. Â 
Â 
I love the fact that they are at the Eyrie, but got annoyed with Robert knowing that Sansa's real name and the clumsy Jon Arryn reveal but was still good to see the craziness of Lysa.
Â 
Love any scene withÂ Maisie Williams and Rory McCann and Craster's seemed to tidy up where they'd gone off the rails a little.
363	Metopheles	2014-05-13	How was the Jon Arryn reveal clumsy? It was perfect. Perfect timing, perfect context, extraordinary delivery, and Baelish's reaction was great. This was the highlight of the episode because it was delivered so casually and not in an epic way. This is how it should have been.
364	Shpati	2014-05-13	Lot will disagree with me on this, but this season feels really different to me. I think the costumes and sets look too modern (specifically the Iron Bank and Joff's wedding). Dany looks like she shopped at GAP. I loved the sets and costumes from the previous seasons, but this season feels different.Â

(and he named Elia after his sister)
531	Dany's Silver	2014-05-04	What did Oberyn say about the Sand Snakes?


Saying his daughter Elia's name makes him sad, and then angry. He describes her as a difficult child to Cersei.

Locke won't take Bowen Marsh's place after all (all heil Hodor!);
According to Jojen Reed, it ends in fire;
Alayne is now LF's niece (no harm done);
The Iron Bank has become a major player, meaning....Â

642	Tom son of Tom	2014-05-04	I can't believe Jon was bested by Carl Focking Tanner.
643	Trebla	2014-05-04	Did Bloodraven warg into Ghost? The ravens cawing right before Ghost mauled Rast made me think so.
644	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-04	Crazy Lysa was the highlightÂ  of the episode.

Agreed! Her reveal was the focus...that and "the iron banks is like a temple"...best line of the episode
645	Zman1863	2014-05-04	I liked that this episode resolved the Craster's subplot neatly without changing too much of the end result, although I'm partial to Ghost showing up just as Jon's about to make his decision regarding Stannis's offer.Â 
Â 
A solid episode overall I think.Â
646	ViennaGirl	2014-05-04	that's the fastest hour of the week, and this will be the fastest 10 weeks of the year...
647	MoIaF	2014-05-04	It ends in fire!
A fine episode.
648	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-04	Worst episode of the season. Â And not just because of my first huge disappointment with the early Jon Arryn reveal. It was just overall bad.
Â 
As expected, next week looks infinitely better.

she also explained that tyrion didn't want the marriage any more than she did. also, did you see her expression upon hearing about her marrying robin? nice!
650	Ned's Sword	2014-05-04	not a big fan of the episode overall but it was nice to see Lysa and Sweetrobin again
651	sj4iy	2014-05-04	Oh my god. I can't believe how much I loved that episode. It kicked ass in so, so many ways.

655	Obebb	2014-05-04	The funniest thing happened! My sister and I were watching together. Then, as soon as the scene cuts to Pod with that burning rabbit, the fire alarm goes off in my house. No joke, I am serious. It turns out my dad set it off by accident. Anyways, I could not stop laughing. It's like Pod set off my fire alarm. Pure gold. 
Â 
Now onto more serious stuff. That Craster stuff. Worst storyline ever. I wish to God that Bran was never tied into that. D&D wrote Meera into an absolutely useless character. Ugh. That was terrible. Like, come on. No more character assassination please. Gosh I will be angry foreverÂ  Â  Â  Â

656	Bastard of Boston	2014-05-04	My favorite part of the episode was finally seeing Arya doing something impressive with the sword. It's about time we started to see a taste of her skill. Up to this point, she's been entirely too awkward. Up until tonight, she needed to be further along.
657	Ginevra	2014-05-04	Looks like Lysa is giving birth to Petyr instead of sexing him...


Seriously. Â How can one get that much from Little Finger? Â :pun probably intended:
658	ViennaGirl	2014-05-04	Cersei's really working the judges, ugh. Lysa was amazing, and Sansa - the Eyrie ending is going to be incredible. Love to see the NW fight, love Jon as a badass, LOVE THAT GHOST IS BACK
659	Jamie Lannister	2014-05-04	Worst episode of the season. Â And not just because of my first huge disappointment with the early Jon Arryn reveal. It was just overall bad.
Â 
As expected, next week looks infinitely better.


Â 
This. Not impressed at all this week, but looking forward to some good stuff next time.
660	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-04	Did Bloodraven warg into Ghost? The ravens cawing right before Ghost mauled Rast made me think so.


I thought he was going to meet a Other, because of the last two times we've seen them they've been preceded by crows


Agreed! Her reveal was the focus...that and "the iron banks is like a temple"...best line of the episode


Yeah, plus I loved Robert in this episode. Dude was talking about his father and sansa's family all being murdered like it ain't no thing. And then he tosses LF's present out the moon door.
661	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-04	So, Jojen knows how the books are going to end?
Â

663	bloodsteel bitterraven	2014-05-04	Is the brotherhood and their new leader watching Brienne and Pod?
664	Newstar	2014-05-04	Seriously. Â How can one get that much from Little Finger? Â :pun probably intended:


Â 
Who's to say his, er, little finger had anything to do with it?
Â 
The problem with Lysa's cray being fully on display in this episode is that it will come as a shock to precisely no one when she tries to kill Sansa a few episodes down the road.
Â 
A nice detail I liked, sort of retroactively: when Brienne and Pod rode off in 4x04, you could see Brienne riding well and Pod weaving all over the place, to the point where I wondered "Why is Pod riding so badly? It's so distracting." That tied in nicely with Pod's terrible riding in this episode.

That's not spoiling the book, though.Â  We've got Lannister POVs, including Ser Kevan, who clearly know the state of their mining.Â  They aren't short of funds.

Yeah, I think we were all bracing ourselves for it next season, and then this season started smacking us in the face with stuff. I don't mind myself, but it is interesting they're starting down that path so early. I'm taking this to mean that TWOW definitely won't be published before S5
699	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-04	i am a bit weirded out by Sansa saying "i am a virgin". Shouldn't it be " i am a maiden"?
700	Faint	2014-05-04	he's due to meet bloodraven and the cotf this season, if i'm not mistaken.


Â 


They're obviously going into late ADwD/early TWoW territory next season because he meets BR in ep.10.


Â 
Problem is, they have exactly three chapters to cover until they catch up (one of them a meaningless travelogue) and fifteen episodes to do it in.Â  Unless they plan on Bran being absent from the narrative multiple episodes at a time, they will either have to invent a whole lot of new material or draw heavily from his story in The Winds of Winter well ahead of the other characters.
701	ultimo12	2014-05-04	Fighting with a longsword in an enclosed place against someone with two daggers is pretty difficult. But Snow recovered in the end.


Against sword and Dagger I would agree, but with a longsword against two daggers and no shield he should be able to hold him at a distance and get a few well placed thrusts in, but who cares really, it's only TV after all
702	TheNinjaDC	2014-05-04	Â 
was that fan theory?
Â 
is no one else interested in that tidbit? are they really implying that the realm is substantially funded directly by the lannisters and now they're broke?


Yes, it's been proposed several times that the Lannister mines are like that Quarth guys vault.Â 
They are not poor, but their endless money pool dryed up and they survive as a bank of sorts and off Lannisport taxes.
Â 
As I recall there is also a bit in the Dance of Dragons war were a Lannister steals a big percentage of the realms wealth for "safe" keeping. That could be how they were holding on.
703	NightStark	2014-05-04	Â 
i am a bit weirded out by Sansa saying "i am a virgin". Shouldn't it be " i am a maiden"?
Â 


I doubt show watchers would get that. They'd just be thinking 'Yeah we know you're a woman thanks'.
704	Stannis-the-Mannis	2014-05-04	The Lannisters are secretly BROKE????? How does that make any sense?
705	Kaspiro	2014-05-04	So the last episode ended in ice, and this one ended in fire.Â 

Also I'm kind of sad that they killed off Locke before he could do much.
706	Stannis I	2014-05-04	Â 
but once he does that, there's really nothing left for him.Â 


Nothing left BEFORE TWW... maybe next season we'll know more about Bloodraven and why in the seven hells he made Bran travel that far north... I hope it's not to become a f* tree!
707	Chebyshov	2014-05-04	i am a bit weirded out by Sansa saying "i am a virgin". Shouldn't it be " i am a maiden"?

I noticed that too, but I think because in our society we don't necessarily use the term "maiden" to mean that, it was for our clarity. I bet they won't call it a "maidenhead" either
708	Newstar	2014-05-04	Â 
i am a bit weirded out by Sansa saying "i am a virgin". Shouldn't it be " i am a maiden"?
Â 


Â 
Bit of a sop to the TV viewership, who would probably interpret "maiden" to mean "young woman" as opposed to "virgin."
Â 
Margaery and Cersei looked so pretty in that scene! They always look pretty, obvs, but something about the lighting made them look radiant.
Â 
Oh, also, Dany's decision to stay in Meereen officially exhausts her ASOS storyline, with the exception of Jorah's banishment.

709	marsyao	2014-05-04	I'm a little bummed that Locke died, really liked him as a bad guy.


Â 
Had Locke said his word yet? If he has taken his vow, his action is desersion, and the punishment for that is death, Roose Bolton can not save him. Poor Podrick, he does not know what he is doning, but think about it, if Brienne knows what he is really good at, he could be very useful to her.
710	Darth Pipes	2014-05-04	Weakest episode of the season.Â  There were some good parts but I just wasn't feeling it and there were a number of odds changes, like the idea that the Lannisters are broke all of a sudden.Â  More concerning is that D and D in my opinion have written the three weakest episodes of the season (although I liked the season premiere).
Â 
"What are you going to do, Your Grace?"
Â 
"I'm going to meanderÂ here for the nextÂ season and a half."
Â 
Now you get to experience all the fun that we've have with Dany's story, Unsullied.Â  Enjoy!Â  Between that and the non-reunion between Jon and Bran, I wonder how they're going to react as things drag along.
Â 
Like I said, stuff like the Lannisters being broke I just don't get and still not a fan of what they're doing with the Cersei character, although Lena Headey's performance was very good tonight.Â  Not to mention giving up the who killed Jon Arryn thing like it was nothing.
Â 
I smell more Cersei whitewashing coming up.Â  If the Lannisters are broke, that will be the excuse for Cersei refusing to pay the bank instead of her just being a moron about it.Â  Unless they have her refuse to ask the Tyrells but still, I sense more whitewashing coming on for Cersei's character.
Â 
I have to say, the MVP tonight was Kate Dickie.Â  She captured Lysa's madness brilliantly and knocked it out of the park.Â  Kind of funny too.Â  The kid playing Sweetrobin was good too.
Â 
The battle at Craster's Keep was pretty good and Hodor snapping Locke's neck was badass.Â  Locke was a bastard though I'm sorry to see him go as he was a pretty fun character despite his sadism.
Â 
Enjoyed Brienne and Pod as well.Â  Brienne's armor is beautiful.
Â 
Enjoyed Arya and the Hound too.Â  Thought that was funny how long her list is getting.Â  They seemed to make the Hound's disfigurement more prominent in this episode.Â  They had been doing a bad job with the make-up on that recently.
711	Trebla	2014-05-04	Â 
well yes, they clearly stated the lannisters are broke but what is the connection to the realm and the iron bank? there's nothing about that in the books, is there?


My guess is that it starts to tie in storylines from AFfC, namely the Iron Bank wanting it's due and Cersei telling them to piss off. In the book, she's just being Cersei, thinking she can do what she wants because she's in charge. Show-Cersei is smarter than that so in this case, she has no money to pay off the debts
712	NightStark	2014-05-04	draw heavily from his story in The Winds of Winter well ahead of the other characters.


That's what I said?
Â 
They're already well ahead in some storylines, they're not all moving in unison.
713	sertravisredbeard	2014-05-04	So did anyone predict that Locke would have his neck snapped by Hodor? Â
714	ThePosterThatWasPromised	2014-05-04	Casterly Rocks mines running out of gold doesn't feel right to me.
715	Colonel Green	2014-05-04	The Lannisters are secretly BROKE????? How does that make any sense?


It's to make Cersei look less stupid next season, presumably, because the showrunners think she's actually smart, apparently.
716	Darth Pipes	2014-05-04	The Lannisters are secretly BROKE????? How does that make any sense?


Â 
Â Well, Tyrion's going to be really surprised if he has to end up actually paying Brown Ben and the Second Sons.

720	l2 0 5 5	2014-05-04	Overall solid episode. Â Jon and NW part was badass. Â Happy I wasn't on the 'Locke is gonna be Bowen Marsh or something' bandwagon.
Â 
I'm happy that Bran booked it before talking to Jon. Â Jojen was right that Jon would impede on their journey.
Â 
Weird thinking that Jon and Bran haven't spoke to each other since the pilot.
Â 
The next episode looks like it has potential to be the best this season.Â
721	sj4iy	2014-05-04	Against sword and Dagger I would agree, but with a longsword against two daggers and no shield he should be able to hold him at a distance and get a few well placed thrusts in, but who cares really, it's only TV after all He has the best finishing move of anything ever XD I yelled out "HOLY SH**" when he killed him.
722	Lady Lurksalot	2014-05-04	I was impressed with the lack of rape scenes and random boob and ass shots, though Lysa did her best to make up for that!  :-)
723	WeStillKnowNothingJonSnow	2014-05-04	i must say i am very disappointed with the writing of D&D. They write the dumbest action scenes, implement mindless sex scenes that dont correlate at all with the story. the best aspects of this season so far is the acting and the material Â directly from the books already written by grrm
724	Darth Pipes	2014-05-04	It's to make Cersei look less stupid next season, presumably, because the showrunners think she's actually smart, apparently.

THIS.Â  Cersei is a moronÂ possessed of a certain low cunning.Â  D and D softening her up hasn't done much for the character lately.Â
725	King Zee	2014-05-04	Fire? What the hell was that bullshit?


Â 
Â 
Meera asked Jojen how will it end......meaning how will he die....and he saw himself on fire.
726	DebL66	2014-05-04	Meh.  Underwhelmed by this episode.  The Vale scenes were the best part, with cray cray Lysa and Sweetrobin, mention of Brandon Stark, and Sansa's face at the end.  I love Oberyn.  I don't like the Bran deviation at all.  I guess now show watchers can begin to share in the misery that is Dany lollygagging in Slavers Bay.  Also a big WTF on Cersei being all chummy with Marge.
727	FNF	2014-05-04	Well they dun goofed with the statement that Casterly Rock is broke. The books suggest that while theÂ Crown is in debt, the Lannisters were still in the black and unwilling to go into their own coffers for the Crown's debt...
728	TheNinjaDC	2014-05-04	The Lannisters are secretly BROKE????? How does that make any sense?


The Westerlings are a house almost as old or as old as the Lannister's and their mines went dry.
Â 
The Lannister's active wealth(from inheritances, taxes, and investments) has been loaned out to the kingdom. If they don't get payed back, they're *****.

Â Well, Tyrion's going to be really surprised if he has to end up actually paying Brown Ben and the Second Sons.


Â 
Think of how many people got annoyed at Brienne's chapters in AFFC. The reader knew where Sansa was, so following Brienne around seemed pointless.
Â 
Aren't we now doing that very same thing with Tyrion? He'll move heaven and earth to become Lord of Casterly Rock while we roll our eyes knowing its broke as shit

That really was a violation of Hodor as a person, and it was so different from Bran accidentally warging him to calm him down at Queenscrown.
737	Chebyshov	2014-05-04	theyre saving the bran scenes with the bastard targ and greenseers for next season i bet. should be quite elaborate i hope.Â

738	Bastard of Boston	2014-05-04	Besides Arya doing something with Needle, outside of poking things, other highlights unclude:
Â 
Brienne and Pod are my favorite odd couple in the book. Glad to see that's translating well to the show. Pod's been way too bland up until now, so I'm excited to see some of his character injected into the show, finally.
Â 
And, of course, crazy ass Lysa. I was not expecting them to reveal the master plan in this episode, though. I was betting on that happening in the season finale. This happening here felt like odd placement. I wonder if people are even going to feel the full impact of what the reveal means. It doesn't feel like a scene people will be talking about tomorrow.
739	jons nissa	2014-05-04	Well they dun goofed with the statement that Casterly Rock is broke. The books suggest that while theÂ Crown is in debt, the Lannisters were still in the black and unwilling to go into their own coffers for the Crown's debt...


Â 
ok, glad someone else is saying this. so is this a spoiler for what is really going on with the lannister mines? someone posted up thread that this is similar to the quarthian vault being empty. i wonder if that is indeed the case.
740	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-04	Lysa was really putting the emphasis on Sansa having lost her virginity. She also explicitely mentioned of whether her and Petyr.....foreshadowing or just crazy lysa?

Yeah it reminds me of how it's described in the books where Hodor "curls up and hides" in a corner of his brain when Bran enters
742	Raksha 2014	2014-05-04	Â 
THIS.Â  Cersei is a moronÂ possessed of a certain low cunning.Â  D and D softening her up hasn't done much for the character lately.Â 


Â 
Show-Cersei is an ill-used long-suffering mother whose only crimes were the incest with brother Jaime, spoiling Joffrey, and killing Sansa's wolf. Â Not much resemblance to book-Cersei, who I find more interesting.

744	Darth Pipes	2014-05-04	Â 
Think of how many people got annoyed at Brienne's chapters in AFFC. The reader knew where Sansa was, so following Brienne around seemed pointless.
Â 
Aren't we now doing that very same thing with Tyrion? He'll move heaven and earth to become Lord of Casterly Rock while we roll our eyes knowing its broke as shit


Â 
That's another change btw.Â  Brienne is heading to the Wall.Â  Why not just take a boat to Eastwatch?

Â 
but there was a fight scene where bran warged hodor in order to be able to fight. and the show hasn't shown that hodor feels violated by it so i suppose it's not so bad. tbh, i don't know how they would show that since he can only say hodor and we aren't in his mind.
747	RumHam	2014-05-04	Â 
Â 
Problem is, they have exactly three chapters to cover until they catch up (one of them a meaningless travelogue) and fifteen episodes to do it in.Â  Unless they plan on Bran being absent from the narrative multiple episodes at a time, they will either have to invent a whole lot of new material or draw heavily from his story in The Winds of Winter well ahead of the other characters.


Â 
Why not just have him sit out a season, ala Rickon.
Â 


As I recall there is also a bit in the Dance of Dragons war were a Lannister steals a big percentage of the realms wealth for "safe" keeping. That could be how they were holding on.


Â 
No, some of the royal treasury was sent to the Rock for safe keeping. Â There was no theft.Â
748	Alia Atreides	2014-05-04	But why why why are they making Cersei sympathetic seriously she is the original Ice Queen; she is suggesting Margery marry Tommen and is agreeing to still to marry Loras? and now the Lannister's gold is dry?
Â 
Why make the entire set up of Locke for him to simply die? Honestly I wanted a better death for him and the whole thing with Hodor that was something Bran guarded he didn't even want to share that with Â anyone .
Â 
With the exception of the reunion of Jon & Ghost; this episode was Â meh... next weeks looks like it is going to be good but more made up shite...
Â 
GRR am disappointed at the moment... I will calm down and probably feel better in the morning.
749	YellowDogJen	2014-05-04	I enjoyed the episode a lot! I loved Arya's water dancing (although I don't get how peeps got Syrio's alive from that...) and the dialogue with the Hound, loved Pod and Brienne - the rabbit was hilarious and I loved how Brienne caved and let him help her with the armor. I loved the sword coming outta Tanner's mouth - recalled Gendry stabbing Biter the same way when he was attacking Brienne in the books...tongue! URGH!!!
Â 
I loved Ghost killing Rast, Hodor/Bran...And crazy, crazy Lysa is magnificent!
Â 
Oh, yeah, it was fabulous how SweetRobin immediately threw Uncle Petyr's gift out the Moon Door, the little brat!
750	jons nissa	2014-05-04	Lysa was really putting the emphasis on Sansa having lost her virginity. She also explicitely mentioned of whether her and Petyr.....foreshadowing or just crazy lysa?

I wondered that, too.  Can't wait to see unCat.  
Loved The Hound hearing Arya add him to her list. I'll be sorry to see their storyline end.
Not sure how I liked the vision of BR, will have to watch it again.  Seemed a bit Disney?
753	King Tommen I	2014-05-04	I can't believe Jon was bested by Carl Focking Tanner.

This is what forced me to lower my grade for the episode.
754	joaozinm	2014-05-04	They must be planning something to fix Cersei foolish cause she agreed to marry Loras but we all know she must have something in her mind.
Â 
Maybe she will f*** up everything in her plot and return to the status of dumbest lannister.
755	Newstar	2014-05-04	Oh, crap, it just occurred to me that with the wedding left out, there was no rape attempt on Sansa from a "Marillion"-like character. That could happen later, though, I guess.

758	johndance	2014-05-04	Man, I don't get how I'm seeing a lot of people saying this was the weakest episode of the season. I LOVED this episode. Everything about it was fantastic. Crazy Lysa , pod and brienne, the mentioning of myrcella and the sand snakes, ayra water dancing and the convo about syrio. Awesome fight between Jon and Karl(?). And of course everything with Ghost. 
Also last week was a big wtf moment when bran and co were at crasters. I was very worried they would really screw it up and have Jon and bran meet. They were able to prevent that and have bran in his way. IMO his storyline isn't re written now like I was worried about. They just added a bit. Minor detour. Well done by D&D. 
My favorite of the season so far. Although next weeks does look like it might be better.

764	cybobbie	2014-05-04	Great to see crazy Lysa back, very good performance. However it was very strange to see her admitting her involvement with Jon's dead and with the plot to get Cat in like she was mentioning something so trivial.
Â 
I was also pleased with the way that they managed to make Bran escape without meeting Jon, and Hodor really rocked killing Locke, but in the end I felt sorry for him when he realized some how what he did.
Â 
The part the I didn't like was this strange Cersey that they have on the show. I mean, Marg says that she may call her a sister or "mother" and no reaction at all. Too sweet for my taste. Also don't get what they intend to do with this news that the Lanisters are broken.Â 
Â 
I always love Pod and Brienne's scenes and now that they are together is a joy, but again I think that they are going too far with Pod, I mean he is not that stupid! making him burning the rabbit because he didn't get that he had to skin it was too much, not to mention his riding style. I think that they didn't have to go that far.
765	nara	2014-05-04	I will apologize in advance for being super nitpicky today...The episode had a lot of fun moments, but felt a little sloppy IMHO.Â  I think the showrunners have gotten so used to episode 9 being the big one that they have introduced a lot of filler this season to keep "where whores go" and the battle at the wall in episode 9.Â  Unnecessary, in my opinion--but, like Jon Snow, I know nothing.
Is this the first episode without Peter Dinklage?Â  Anyway, I missed him.Â  Also, why put NCW in the episode with no lines?
Why are they not actually bending the knee?Â  We know the expression exists in show-verse, because Cersei said it in Season 1 and Ned bent the knee to Robert.Â  Seemed like lazy direction to me
Loved Cersei stepping in front of Tommen when he and Marg are gazing into each other's eyes-- laughed out loud!
Cersei brokering marriageâ<U+0080><U+0094>WTF?Â  -- I think that didn't make sense at all for a mother in mourning.Â  As much as I like Cersei not being a complete nitwit, this is ruining the awesomeness that is Tywin.
I think it was sloppy writing for Marg to call Cersei sisterÂ  DIdnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t Cersei already warn her about that and tell her she would strangle Marg in her sleep if she ever called her sister again?Â  Seriously, did the writer not watch the previous episodes?
Emilia looks lovely in that dress.
For some reason, Dany calling Jorah, "Jorah" not "Ser Jorah"Â  is annoying me.Â  However, I'm glad that they gave a scene to him after ignoring him all season.
Loved the lesson from LF â<U+0080><U+0093> know your strengths and use them wisely.Â  Good in real life too.Â 
Why on earth would they make Alayne Petyr's niece?Â  He doesn't have a brother and that's easily known.Â  It would make perfect sense for a man who runs a brothel to have a bastard.Â  Oldly random change.
Impressive scenery at the Eyrie!
Sweetrobin likes Peytr?Â  It seems uncharacteristic that Robin would like anyone who takes his mother's attention from him.Â  However, I can live with it.
I'm really glad they kept Lysa screaming!!!Â  I thought she deserved some happiness.Â  I also liked the reveal of her role in Jon's death and LF shutting her up with a kiss!
Cersei agreeing to marry Loras?Â  Setting a timeline?Â  Another WTF.Â 
I don't care for the Lannisters being revealed as out of gold so quickly, but we'll see.
Lemoncakes!
Pod on a horse was hilarious!Â  I like the change from distain to respect in the relationship between Brienne and Pod. I'm glad that someone knows what he did for Tyrion!
Oberyn not having sex!Â  The best thing in the episode.Â  I did like the scene between him and Cersei, especially the kinda introduction of Sand Snakes!
I really liked Jojenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s vision's and how he tried to save his sister.
â<U+0080><U+009C>Hounds chained up insideâ<U+0080><U+009D>!!!!Â  -- umm, direwolves.Â  Made me laugh.
I saw Snow fall and bury your bones!Â  -- nice!Â  I think this is their way of signalling that snow falling imagery = Jon Snow.
Okay, why doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t Jon sense ghostâ<U+0080><U+0099>s presence?Â  That seemed odd to me...
Bran warging Hodor was great, but I thought the end of Locke was abrupt and premature.
Overall, I think the new Bran scenes made sense to add.Â  Also gave us a couple of kick-ass scenese without ruining the story.

ok, glad someone else is saying this. so is this a spoiler for what is really going on with the lannister mines? someone posted up thread that this is similar to the quarthian vault being empty. i wonder if that is indeed the case.


I've thought this was a real possibility but there isn't any direct evidence for it in the books, just a possible hint or two here and there but nothing that you can really build a case on. Still it does explain Tywins motives at least in the TV universe, Kevan seemed to think that they did have some gold but he didn't mention anything about production in the West or Lannister mines in particular.
767	Paeon	2014-05-04	Tywin did not say the Lannisters are broke, but said that there is no NEW gold being mined. As in they will be broke in the future unless they continue to make moves such as a marriage alliance with the Tyrells.Â
768	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-04	They must be planning something to fix Cersei foolish cause she agreed to marry Loras but we all know she must have something in her mind.

good point, D&D are terrible writers. perhaps if they read the books and understood characters, the show would flow better
774	ohpooratlas	2014-05-04	Found the episode to be a tad underwhelming but there were a few parts I really liked.
Â 
First of all ... the mention of all eight sand snakes. I imagine this means at least one or two will have to turn up in the show.
Â 
Cray Cray Lysa Arryn takes the cake though. And my unsullied boyfriend was like "Hey! I remember that crazy bird!" He did not really get the whole Lysa killing Jon Arryn thing until I explained it to him. That was my biggest nitpick of the episode ... the fact that it was announced so ... dispassionately. Maybe that was the point? So when Only Cat happens it'll have more of an impact?
Â 
If you think about it ... this episode kind of sets up the remaining Starks for their respective futures ...
Â 
Jon Snow --> leading a raid on the mutineers ... presumably to become Lord Commander of the Night's Watch
Bran Stark --> warg and greenseer
Arya Stark --> future master swordsman/assassin
Sansa Stark --> Lady of the Vale
Â 
Also ... I get that "nice" Cersei was just trying to butter up the judges, my only issue is ... I don't see her being that cunning.

This was the second episode ever without Peter Dinklage, maybe the third.Â  The first was Episode 7 of Season 1.Â  There was supposed to be a scene with him and Bronn leaving the Eyrie but they moved that to the next episode.

I hope so but I don't think D and D are clever enough to hatch something like that.Â  Well, maybe they did do it there but they are still setting up to make the Iron Bank stuff not Cersei's fault.


Â 
So you don't think that Cersei doing a complete 180 on all of things that she had established she loathed prior to this episode to the three people who are going to "happen" to be judges in Tyrion's trial is just a huge coincidence?
Â 
She obviously has no intention of marrying Loras, she can't stand Margaery and more or less offered up Tommen to her on a platter and played on Oberyn's sympathy for family even though he antagonized her and called her a useless, old has-been the last time they talked.

783	johnnysd	2014-05-04	My favorite part of the episode was finally seeing Arya doing something impressive with the sword. It's about time we started to see a taste of her skill. Up to this point, she's been entirely too awkward. Up until tonight, she needed to be further along.


Â 
Seems to me they showed instead she will never be a killer with a sword which sort of nicely shadows what she learns later.
Â 
I thought it was a great episode, and really took a lot from the books to sort of course correct the additional Bran diversion.

Â 
even that's out of character since book cersei was never that shrewd. still, if she suddenly becomes mean after the trial and says something along these lines, it will be interesting. i suppose.
Â 
Â 


Yeah, that's pretty sick. And another thing I bet D&D didn't really think through that much, kind of like Jaime murdering his cousin back in S2.


Â 
this happened in the books.

820	WeStillKnowNothingJonSnow	2014-05-04	the fact that the show isnt nearly as well done as the books, considering the poor writing from d&d, it is personally troubling that grrm focuses less time on the books (much better than the show given the writing of course) and more time on the show that inevitably we wait longer for the books. all in good time i guess.

830	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-05-04	I enjoyed the episode a lot! I loved Arya's water dancing  (although I don't get how peeps got Syrio's alive from that...)  and the dialogue with the Hound, loved Pod and Brienne - the rabbit was hilarious and I loved how Brienne caved and let him help her with the armor. I loved the sword coming outta Tanner's mouth - recalled Gendry stabbing Biter the same way when he was attacking Brienne in the books...tongue! URGH!!!
Â 
I loved Ghost killing Rast, Hodor/Bran...And crazy, crazy Lysa is magnificent!
Â 
Oh, yeah, it was fabulous how SweetRobin immediately threw Uncle Petyr's gift out the Moon Door, the little brat! 

Because the Hound makes it clear that its absolutely ridiculous for the first sword of Braavos to have been bested by Trant. I'm not saying I necessarily believe Syrio is alive but that's why people are saying that part hinted to it.

A trueborn niece would be way harder to produce out of thin air than a bastard.Â  There are records kept of the genealogies of noble houses; "Alayne", if she were trueborn, would be expected to be listed in stuff like that.

Â 
Was that a strong implication that Jojen (who has already seen his own death) is going to die by burning? Maybe burned by the CotF in some ritual? Crazy stuff.
Â 
Also, what's the significance of the ravens cawing on the show at this point? Hints towards BR? WW? No particular significance?
846	Newstar	2014-05-04	Jojen's bit of dialogue with Bran also reeked of potential book spoilers:
Â 
Jojen: We're only here to guide you. He's waiting for you. We have to find it. You have to make it.
Bran: We will.
Jojen (to Bran): This...this isn't the end. Not for you. Not yet.
Meera: How...will we know the end?
Jojen (looks at his hand, which is burning): You'll know.
Â 
It almost seems like the show is implying that Bran and/or Meera die by burning, but I doubt the show would be that on the nose.
847	koftroy	2014-05-04	my least favorite epi; I hate the way Cersei is played, she always seems whitewashed. She's a crazy, aggressive, manipulative you know what, I love to hate in the books, she is so boring here. Occasionally, when she's drunk, the real one shows up. I am just happy Jon has Ghost back; hopefully they will actually be together; like Summer is with Bran. oh well, I'll do another watch....but hey, not all 10 can be great, right? What about the Vale? I need to reread some chapters, I don't remember that letter and Jon A, all being done by Peter. And Oberyn? that was the way they decided to show that he is a poet as well?

853	Colonel Green	2014-05-04	so Kevan was in charge of all their finances? he didn't like frivolity & thought he was concerned with Cerseis spending


He was concerned because she was irresponsible, but said that at worst they would have to dip into the Lannisters' own finances.Â  And yes, Kevan was the head of the family at that point, and Tywin's right hand man.Â  If their mines were dry, he would know.Â  For that matter, somebody in Robb's army would have noticed that when they were rampaging through the Westerlands.
854	WeStillKnowNothingJonSnow	2014-05-04	A trueborn niece would be way harder to produce out of thin air than a bastard.Â  There are records kept of the genealogies of noble houses; "Alayne", if she were trueborn, would be expected to be listed in stuff like that.
Â 
Children of cousins are cousins at a certain remove.Â  A child of Littlefinger's first cousin would be a first cousin, once removed.


im guessing lysa would despise sansa even more if he said Â she was his bastard, thus further supporting some speculation that she thinks sansa is actually pety's bastard with catelyn. considering how little d&d regards the intelligence of show viers with their conspicous writing, saying she was his daughter may create some conflict and confusion
855	Newstar	2014-05-04	I personally don't mind the Jon Arryn reveal coming this early. I hated that exposition dump in the books prior to the murder attempt: cheesy villain(ess) monologuing, very clumsy writing.Â  This breaks it up a little. It's still clumsy, but it won't break up the tension in the scene where Lysa is trying to kill Sansa with a bunch of expository villainess monologuing explaining in great detail exactly what Lysa's deal is. Likewise for the scene with Sansa in this episode where Lysa shows her crazy, jealous side early on.

Or a cousin. Nieces and nephews can also be the children of cousins.
Â 
Anyway, I like it's his niece. It kinda makes sense and it's more logical than suddenly show up with a bastard. A niece, he could have decided to bring her to his new permanent residence in the Vale because he wanted to look for a good marriage, which is probably what are his real plans.

But I love the idea that Sansa models her bastard persona after her brother Jon Snow. Of course, that angle would probably be completely lost on the unsullied, but not on us.

Are you sure you arent letting Â AFFC Â Cersei affect your opinion of Â ASOS Â Cersei ? Â Tywin's death had a major impact on her personality.


Â 
perhaps, she always seem predictable to me is all, yes people lose it all the time and some never had it at all.

He owns a brothel.Â  It seems normal that he would have a bastard from there...
859	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-04	...............i dont remember the Lannisters being all out of gold in the books, they are broke?


I took it to mean they aren't out of money, just not able to produce new coin cause the mining is all done. Â They don't really have source of new income Â through their mines.
860	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-04	Pouring one out (of a skull) for THE FOOKING LEGEND OF GIN ALLEY Â<U+0099>, you were a fantastic dickhead.Â  Hopefully Burn Gorman is on to a bigger and brighter future, perhaps including the lead role in a Willem Defoe biopic.
Â 
Backstabbed by a daughter-wife, right after spitting in Jon's eye and praising the pros of Not Fighting With Honor.Â  And then Jon flanked him like a boss.Â  A backstabby boss.Â  CONCLUSION:Â  Jon "know nothing" Snow learning how to not fight with honor when necessary.Â  Here's hoping anyway, it's a valuable lesson to learn, especially when you're fixin' to be The Hero of this whole shebang.Â  Now that Ghost is back, there should be plenty of opportunity for effective dishonorable flanking.Â  Was half expecting Ghost to bring the pain on THE FOOKING LEGEND OF GIN ALLEY Â<U+0099>, but there's fine closure in it being a daughter-wife.
Â 
Really enjoyed the finer points of how and why they kept Jon and Bran from meeting.Â  Locke fudging his recon report to lead Jon away from where he'd find him, and Bran making the sacrifice/tough decision not to let Jon know he's alive.Â  Which is back in concert with the books, even though Bran's making the decision in a different spot and with different people around.
Â 
And mentioned already in passing, but how about the loafer of the Direwolves, GHOST, finally putting in some work?Â  Welcome back, whitey.Â  As soon as Edd's mutineer head count came up short, and Rast was named as the short head, you just knew what was coming.Â  No kill-stealing here, Ghost finally got to add a deserved notch to his score-sheet.
Â 
Screw Dany, HODOR~! is the true Breaker of Chains.Â  Did not expect Locke to go down this quickly, but it's a good time and a good way to write him out.Â  Dummy made his move on Starksassination too quickly (where's Rickon?) and paid the price.Â  Also liked Hodor staring accusingly (and fearfully) at his hands, reminding us that Regulatin' on Locke is very much not his nature, and laying the groundwork for how This Is Not Okay, even though it was for the greater good this week, Bran is going down an unpleasant path by Warging Into Hodor.
Â 
I guess Locke WON'T be the man whose ear Brienne bites off, after all.Â  Even though it sounds like she's heading that way.Â  She thinks Sansa's heading off to meet Jon at The Wall.Â  Dead wrong, of course, as we know, but it's a better plan than her book plan.Â  Come to think of it, why didn't she think of that possibility in the books?Â  I guess Cat wouldn't have mentioned Jon's existence  but then how did she learn about Jon as a possibility in the show?Â  Maybe Jaime remembered him, I guess.
Â 
So Ser Milady has a plan, and a still-unclaimed reservation at Ear Restaurant.Â  Plenty to look forward to.
Â 
MACE TYRELL SHOWED UP THIS WEEK.Â  Maybe next week he'll get to actually talk.Â  He's the one judge we didn't see Cersei talk to this week, she still owes him a lobbyin'.Â  Also got half of Loras' head in one shot.Â  That's a pretty successful week for Male Tyrells.
Â 
"Meryn Trant?Â  The so called best swordsman of all time got killed by Meryn Fucking Trant?"Â  Awesome.Â  Loving The Hound.
Â 
Sophie Turner with the greatest "fuck this" face while trying to get some sleep listening to Aunt Lysa's O-voice.Â  And "Alayne" is a niece now.Â  Hrmm.Â  As a fan of Sansa playing "bastard" laying the groundwork for appreciation of and reuniting with Jon Snow someday, I'm disappointed by this change.Â  But really, it's probably not that big a deal overall, just to me.
Â 
I guess it makes the proposed marriage to Robin less squicky and incesty if they're not "officially" step-siblings already.
Â 
Speaking of which, fucking love the little detail of Robin being overjoyed to see "Uncle" Petyr, adoring the little glass falcon gift, but immediately losing interest in it and chucking it out the Moon Door.
Â 
Speaking of which, Lysa is crazy as hell.Â  Manic Much?Â  From almost breaking Sansa's hands to cradling her head in seconds.Â  Oh, and how about getting the big reveal about how she lied in letter to Cat, and actually was the one who poisoned Jon Arryn.
Â 
CERSEI REMEMBERED MYRCELLA EXISTS.Â  Way to take the first step on that path to not being a shitty mom!
Â 
Kinda was hoping for a tension-breaking joke, or any sort of light hearted one-liner, from the newly crowned King Tommen I.Â  I guess the smile is enough for now.
Â 
In other kingsguard recaps, Pod goes the idiot-savant route by being completely useless to Brienne and annoying her until she finally asks "Did you do ANYTHING useful as Tyrion's squire?" to which Pod of course reminds us of the time he made the world a better place by ganking Mandon Moore with a spear (though Moore goes unnamed).Â  And then Brienne throws him a bone by letting him undo her straps.Â  D'awwwwww.
Â 
Oberyn appeared in this episode and did NOT have sex with anyone.Â  Fortunately his Average Lays Per Episode (ALPE) is still in fine shape thanks to that foursome that got interrupted by Tywin two weeks ago.
Â 
Speaking of which, Tywin is at last admitting that The Iron Bank is a problem.Â  When Tywin says "you do NOT fuck with these guys" guess what?Â  It means you REALLY don't fuck with these guys.Â  And we get a tangible reason why, even in a "post-war" scenario, the Lannisters still need the Tyrells.Â  The Gold Mines are OVER, the crown still owes that debt Robert racked up, so letting the second richest family marry into the crown means they can use the Tyrells to pay off the debt.Â  Of course, once upon a time the Tyrells were a major creditor of Robert's crown themselves.Â  So much for getting that back 
Â 
And Dany knows that Joffrey is dead.Â  Barristan The Smug thinks they can take King's Landing NOW.Â  Daario takes a shot at us book readers waiting decades for Dany's invasion by mentioning off hand "oh yeah, that fleet you need?Â  I got that."Â  93 ships.Â  8000 Unsullied and 2000 Mercs, Drogon is aÂ  Big Boy, and the Offcial Flag Of Team Targaryen is stitched and ready to go as of last week, there is no reason for Dany to hold back a second longer, she's finally got everything she needs to retake her homeland while it's at its most vulnerable so here we go at last with the invaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaait a minute.Â  Jorah The Fedorah, looking even more haggard than usual, once upon a time the man on this team most eager to get the fuck back to Westeros so much so that he was spying on Dany for Varys (where did that plot element go?Â  Did Salladhor Saan steal it on his way out of the show?), is now saying Don't Go Back To Westeros.Â  Jorah does mention "we might not have enough for KL.Â  We definitely don't have enough for the whole country."Â  He does NOT mention that the proposed invasion plan is probably pretty stupid because Stannis the Mannis recently tried the exact same thing and if he couldn't get it to work it ain't working.
Â 
In the end, Dany decides to do what is, really, the responsible thing.Â  Also the boring thing.Â  Fedorah tells her about how Yunkai and Astapor have slipped back into the same old shit without her literally squatting on them to make her reforms stick.Â  "How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't hold my own castle Slaver's Bay?"Â  Careful, Dany, you're skirting close to Robb Stark territory.Â  Just make sure you don't get smitten with somebody below your station and blow your chance at a powe.............. aww dammit.
Â 
Barristan really is getting very non-canon these days.Â  Hasn't kicked an ass since killing that Manticore in S3 E1, all he seems to do is get sauced in Dany's tent and act as Chief Administrator Of Dissing The Enemy in Dany's council meetings.Â  Jorah doesn't even feel threatened by him (and his potential to blow Jorah's secret) anymore.Â  Weird.Â  The actors sold that element well with some solid eyes-only acting last year.
Â 
But I may have enjoyed the "Next Week" preview most of all, what with the glimpses of two long-missing faces I'm overeager to see again.

I know. I wish we could have seen manipulative Cersei like, try and get in good with the judges for Tyrion's upcoming trial and maybe even promise them things she abhors in an attempt to secure their votes.

And they clue SweetRobin in on "Alayne"'s true identity because the kid is such a model of discretion and self-control.
864	Bear Claw	2014-05-04	I enjoyed the Vale. Although, I liked the action at Craster's I am puzzled as to why the show dropped Coldhands in favor of this plot line.Â Â Cold hands offers action, adventure and makes more sense.Â Â In the end, the Bran hostage story line feels contrived.Â  I did like the peak into Jojen'sÂ  visions.Â Â

What?Â  Why would Lysa think Sansa was Petyr's daughter?Â  Catelyn was way up in the middle of the North; and Petyr transparently wants to bone Sansa.
866	Lyanna<3Rhaegar	2014-05-04	Except it was clearly the Hound mocking Syrios skills...not insisting his mystic powers bested Trant and were all in the dark.

Well yes he is mocking Syrio's skill but he doesn't know Syrio. We know Syrio is a bad ass. He is insinuating Syrio is not near as good as Arya is saying, we know he is so to think he was bested by Trant is silly. That's what people are getting at when they say it means Syrio is still alive. As I said I don't think he is. He was a bad ass & was indeed the first sword of Braavos BUT he only had a broken wooden sword facing a man with a sword & in full armor. I think he is dead but with so many people being dead & then not dead... who knows.
867	Zman1863	2014-05-04	I'm not really fussed on the Jon Arryn reveal. The show has never really been known for subtlety. Why is it necessary to dump it all in one shot? Especially since show viewers haven't encountered this stuff in three years?
868	Winterfell's Revenge	2014-05-04	Â 
This was the second episode ever without Peter Dinklage, maybe the third.Â  The first was Episode 7 of Season 1.Â  There was supposed to be a scene with him and Bronn leaving the Eyrie but they moved that to the next episode.


Â 
Every season he's not in one episode.

870	sj4iy	2014-05-04	Yeah, that's pretty sick. And another thing I bet D&D didn't really think through that much, kind of like Jaime murdering his cousin back in S2.You're right, I'm sure they haven't thought it through at all. That's why they put in the part with Hodor looking upset and shaking when he saw the blood on his hands.Sheesh, give these guys a break and just wait to see how everything plays out before acting as if they don't know what they are doing, because they know better than any of us.
871	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-04	Â 
Agreed.Â  If they had left it at "The things I've done for you, Petyr" that would have been fine.


Â 
I liked:
Â 
-Cersei
-Cersei
-Margaery...Cersei
-No Peter Dinklage
-Night's Watch vs Mutineers
-Jojen fucking Reed
Â 
Meh:
-Daenerys (one scene and done is getting old)
Â 
Did not like:
-Lysa going overboard on the crazy (felt x10 as crazy as S1 interpretation)
-There is no need to rush Sansa's storyline, I am convinced "Only Cat" is ep.7 now
-So they correct the large infodump of "Only Cat" by moving the Jon Arryn reveal earlier, into an utterly and awkward "whatever" infodump
-Fake Stark reunion (I thought I saw this like 6 episodes ago)
-Meera being taunted rape (a purely invented scene, unlike the ambiguous Cersei/Jaime scene)
-Locke's character wasted in the manner Ros's character was wasted for Dontos
Â 
My biggest complaint is the character assassination of Hodor. How dare you take his innocence like an afterthought, D&D.

1000000% how I feel. Â I put up with almost all of their changes silently, but this one really bothered me.


Â The last couple episodes they've been almost insulting with how thick and obvious they've been explaining some of the plot points. Last episode, they had Littlefinger explain to Sansa that someone with common interests helped him kill Joffrey, then immediately afterward flashed to an image of Olenna and Margaery. That should have been enough to make the audience realize who was behing everything, but then they spend ANOTHER scene where Olenna again explained that it was her that did it. I half expected there to be a director's cut where D&D appeared sitting in reclining chairs after that scene, and said "For those of you who still don't understand....Littlefinger and Olenna were behind Joffrey's murder. Okay, now back to the program"....
873	Thelastactionhero	2014-05-04	God. That Karl Tanner fight with Jon Snow was epic as fuck.
874	King Tommen I	2014-05-04	Fighting with a longsword in an enclosed place against someone with two daggers is pretty difficult. But Snow recovered in the end.

Did you miss his last line stating Meryn killed Syrio because Meryn had armor and a 'big fucking sword'? - and Syrio didn't?

For gods sake did you miss my line where I said I don't think he is alive?! Another poster was asking why people are taking from that convo that Syrio is alive. I was just explaining other peoples opinions to them. You are barking up the wrong tree. I completely agree Syrio is dead & gone & not coming back...
876	WeStillKnowNothingJonSnow	2014-05-04	What?Â  Why would Lysa think Sansa was Petyr's daughter?Â  Catelyn was way up in the middle of the North; and Petyr transparently wants to bone Sansa.


because lysa is a crazy bitch who thinks sansa may be pregnant with petyrs(in the show at least) baby and knows he loved catelyn deeply. i dont think its such a stretch for her to think she is his child
877	WTFSalami	2014-05-04	I need to reread some chapters, I don't remember that letter and Jon A, all being done by Peter.Â

878	SerJorahMormont	2014-05-04	show cersei is weirding me out with her passiveness.
879	johnnysd	2014-05-04	Â 
Show-Cersei is an ill-used long-suffering mother whose only crimes were the incest with brother Jaime, spoiling Joffrey, and killing Sansa's wolf. Â Not much resemblance to book-Cersei, who I find more interesting.


Â 
Can't say I do. Book Cersei is an idiotic, one note psycho. I think they will still eventually bring the Cersei crazy but it will be more earned by that point.
880	Darth Pipes	2014-05-04	Speaking of puzzling changes, what the hell was with Sansa posing as Petyr's niece instead of his bastard daughter?Â  Instead of taking the easy explanation from the books, D and D like to changed things in a way that's convoluted and make no sense.Â  I don't get their obsession with doing that.Â  Seriously, the reason he gave in the book was fine.Â  So they created an sibling we'll never see of Petyr?

Â 
You don't think that takes away the element of, "Oh shit!?!?" that would have come? I think, with the way its been presented, the Snow Castle/Only Cat scene will now become an eventuality rather than a shock.
882	Thelastactionhero	2014-05-04	Bringing Syrio back is not in George's nature, despite the whole business about him not dying on screen. He has a great death, and it would cheapen him as a character to have him miraculously survive the encounter. The fact that he bites it to a lesser swordsman and complete douche is what makes his death tragic, and yet realistic.Â
883	Jackie Coogan	2014-05-04	Anybody else glad the CrasterÂ´s keep filler plot is finally over? Â
884	jarl the climber	2014-05-04	I took it to mean they aren't out of money, just not able to produce new coin cause the mining is all done. Â They don't really have source of new income Â through their mines.


Actually they would have considerable incomes from the interest on the loans they have made to the crown. Hence the need to hold the throne as opposed to controling it behind the scenes with their financial power.
885	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-04	About Cersei, at this point in books, we don't get her POV yet. So, we don't actually know how crazy she is. Also, maybe she felt protected by Tywin, confident on Tyrion being killed and joyful because she defeated Maggy's prophecy.
Â 
Once Tyrion escapes, though...

887	johnnysd	2014-05-04	I enjoyed the episode a lot! I loved Arya's water dancing (although I don't get how peeps got Syrio's alive from that...) and the dialogue with the Hound, loved Pod and Brienne - the rabbit was hilarious and I loved how Brienne caved and let him help her with the armor. I loved the sword coming outta Tanner's mouth - recalled Gendry stabbing Biter the same way when he was attacking Brienne in the books...tongue! URGH!!!
Â 
I loved Ghost killing Rast, Hodor/Bran...And crazy, crazy Lysa is magnificent!
Â 
Oh, yeah, it was fabulous how SweetRobin immediately threw Uncle Petyr's gift out the Moon Door, the little brat! 


Â 
Two ways to take the scene.
Â 
The literal way: No way could a Bravosi master take even the least skilled Kingsguard in plate with a broadsword
Â 
Or the more subtle way: Syrio is a master swordsman, something the Hound knows nothing about, and no master swordsman of Bravvos could be killed by an inept Kingsguard regardless of him wearing plate and having a big sword
Â 
If Arya's view of Syrio is correct, the scene is ironic because Syrio is alive.
888	WeStillKnowNothingJonSnow	2014-05-04	Bringing Syrio back is not in George's nature, despite the whole business about him not dying on screen.

yet he is a bravosi, and in the series, people from braavos seems to have a certain mystique about them...
889	ohpooratlas	2014-05-04	Maybe when Petyr starts creeping on Sansa, having her pose as his fake niece will be easier for the audience to ingest than if she masqueraded as his fake daughter?
Â 
I thought it was weird too, though I honestly didn't think "so now Petyr has a sibling I don't know about" until other posters here brought it up.
890	Mladen	2014-05-04	I am sorry, but this was just bad. Not interesting, not subtle, not intelligently written... Dull... I am all for praises when deserved but this week was just bad...
Â 
There were some moments I liked but overall impression is rather bad:
Â 
1. Cersei... Especially liked how she saw through Margaery's sweet face... Although that conversation come from God knows where, it was kinda nice
2. Vale... This was all messed up... But thumbs up for the worst plausible romance
3. Bran and Jon not meeting... I liked that... It honored the book material in season where the same was ripped apart.
4. And so we begin with Meereenese plot
5. Oberyn... I mean he can appear just sitting and meditating and I would like the guy...
Â 
Brienne and Pod's conversation was pointless, Locke was pointless... Someone should tell Mis Clarke that badassery works to a point. The reunion between Jon and Ghost was underwhelming. Just bad... I didn't like it.
891	Seven Sevens	2014-05-04	What was the bird that Robin dropped through the moon door made of? Reckon it would smash? Right now I'm picturing a dead Lysa laying next to the bird as the final shot of whatever episode "Only Cat" happens in. If it's during 'Mockingbird' then I think that would be a perfect scenario if not a little cheesy. It just popped in my mind and I hope to see it but I somewhat doubt we'll see her body at all, just the fall.
892	Zman1863	2014-05-04	Anybody else glad the CrasterÂ´s keep filler plot is finally over? Â 


Â 
Yes but I was pleasantly surprised they wrapped it up so quickly and so neatly.Â 
Â 


Bringing Syrio back is not in George's nature, despite the whole business about him not dying on screen. He has a great death, and it would cheapen him as a character to have him miraculously survive the encounter. The fact that he bites it to a lesser swordsman and complete douche is what makes his death tragic, and yet realistic.Â 


Â 
I don't know, he's brought back a couple other characters that were actually physically dead and will probably bring back at least one more so I'm not sold on Syrio being dead until I see a body stamped with a notary's seal.Â
893	When Harry met Sansa	2014-05-04	Best part of this episode was obviously Robin throwing Petyr's gift out the Moon Door--worst moment of the episode was not immediately showing Petyr's inevitable derp face at witnessing that act.Â

Two ways to take the scene.
Â 
The literal way: No way could a Bravosi master take even the least skilled Kingsguard in plate with a broadsword
Â 
Or the more subtle way: Syrio is a master swordsman, something the Hound knows nothing about, and no master swordsman of Bravvos could be killed by an inept Kingsguard regardless of him wearing plate and having a big sword
Â 
If Arya's view of Syrio is correct, the scene is ironic because Syrio is alive.

A master swordsman with no sword, is no longer a master swordsman.
895	TheNinjaDC	2014-05-04	God. That Karl Tanner fight with Jon Snow was epic as fuck.


When Jon entered the cabin, with fire reflecting off the blood on Longclaw's edge,Â 
SO *******ING EPIC!
Â 
You knew ***** was about to go down, and it did.
896	The Lizard King	2014-05-04	Â 
Did he toss it out the Moon Door in front of the person who had given him the gift because he's just that thoughtless and spoiled, or because he's genuinely disturbed? Hard to tell.


Â 
Joffey sliced up the book that Tyrion and Sansa gave him at his wedding with Widow's Wail.
897	Belisarius09	2014-05-04	1. good job on the LF lysa dynamic
Â 
2. Didn't like the change with the lannister gold mines running out.Â  This is a change from the books because we know when Robb is plundering the westerlands, the captures some of the gold mines and the gold is flowing.Â  The only mines that had failed that we know of were the mines belonging to the crag.
Â 
3.Â  handled the crasters keep sub plot well, good thing keeping jon and bran apart
Â 
4.Â  White washing Dany some more, she doesn't have ships in the books.Â  They all sailed away before she captured the city, so she didn't have a choice, she had to stay.Â  Of course they change this to make dany look better so she "chooses" to stay behind and try to make things right.
Â 
5.Â  Didn't like Arya including beric dondarrion, and thoros of myr to her death list.
Â 
6.Â  Locke's death seemed abrupt
Â 
7. how the fuck they're going to do this 50 ironborn attacking the dreadfort subplot, not from the book, baffles me
Â 
8.Â  Stannis is going to bravos... i'd heard it but now it seems to be happening for sure, will be interesting to see how this pans out
Â 
All in all, the show is straying further and further from the books.Â  This might be a good thing though, since the show will likely catch up to GRRM before he finishes the series, maybe its for the best if it has its own, unique, completely different ending.Â  So, instead of nitpicking in the future, I'm going to try to enjoy the show more for being its own unique breed.Â

898	Thelastactionhero	2014-05-04	yet he is a bravosi, and in the series, people from braavos seems to have a certain mystique about them...


Certainly. But is there really any reasonable evidence in the lore to support the idea that Syrio and Trent both survive the encounter? Something that's important is to remember George's thoughts on Tolkien bringing Gandalf back. He states that Gandalf had a great death, the Fellowship should have had to pick themselves up and carry on without him. Arya having to pick herself up and carry on following Syrio's death has far more thematic weight, and I trust George enough to do the right thing and let him stay dead.
Â 
Â 


Â 
Duuuuuude! Karl is fucking amazing with those knives! WOW!
Im just glad Ghost got to gnaw on someone's dome!


When he readies his knives as bows to "Lord Snow", my heart started racing. Shit was perfectly executed. I think it's awesome that Jon can't actually defeat him in single combat, because the way Craster's wife does him in is just way more compelling than him losing outright.

Â 
Aidan Gillen's hilarious faces were the best part of the episode for me, although I did love Sweetrobin throwing the bird out the Moon Door, and Sansa's disturbed expression after he did it.

4. And so we begin with Meereenese plot

I feel his, "Oh *****" face when she opened the door with the Septon ready to marry, made up for that.

902	hedgeknight001	2014-05-04	ok, glad someone else is saying this. so is this a spoiler for what is really going on with the lannister mines? someone posted up thread that this is similar to the quarthian vault being empty. i wonder if that is indeed the case.

I think -- maybe -- that D&D are feeling the need to reinforce why the consequences for the crown *and* the Lannisters are for screwing over the Iron Bank. If they set-up the Lannisters as basically broke, the Lannisters therefore cannot come to the aid of the crown. 
Otherwise, when the sh*t starts hitting the fan because of realm debt, viewers might scratch their heads and say, "So, why can't Tywin Lannister just write a check and cover the debt?"
903	sj4iy	2014-05-04	My least favorite episode of the season, but wasn't awful or anything. Didn't move things forward all that much though it caught us up on the Vale, etc.Â Was that a strong implication that Jojen (who has already seen his own death) is going to die by burning? Maybe burned by the CotF in some ritual? Crazy stuff.Â Also, what's the significance of the ravens cawing on the show at this point? Hints towards BR? WW? No particular significance?Actually, it makes me wonder if BR had a hand in freeing Ghost, because the ravens started to caw and suddenly the door is open and Ghost is gone.
904	Thelastactionhero	2014-05-04	Â 
Â 
I don't know, he's brought back a couple other characters that were actually physically dead and will probably bring back at least one more so I'm not sold on Syrio being dead until I see a body stamped with a notary's seal.Â 


I get that when a character doesn't die on screen, it's normally a sign that there's something more going on, but in this case I don't think it would work. His other resurrections serve specific narrative purposes, and I cannot for the life of me justify Syrio's survival on aesthetic grounds.
905	Newstar	2014-05-04	I feel is, "Oh *****" face when she opened the door with the Septon ready to marry, made up for that.


Â 
Yes! That was classic.
906	johnnysd	2014-05-04	the fact that the show isnt nearly as well done as the books, considering the poor writing from d&d, it is personally troubling that grrm focuses less time on the books (much better than the show given the writing of course) and more time on the show that inevitably we wait longer for the books. all in good time i guess.


Â 
They are both excellent in their own right. Book is better in some ways, and the show has improved the story in others.
907	sj4iy	2014-05-04	When he readies his knives as bows to "Lord Snow", my heart started racing. Shit was perfectly executed. I think it's awesome that Jon can't actually defeat him in single combat, because the way Craster's wife does him in is just way more compelling than him losing outright.Same here...was so, so looking forward to that fight all week long and it didn't disappoint at all. I liked that they made it realistic in that Jon had trouble using his sword inside close quarters. And finally a woman gets revenge. Just loved it.
908	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-04	I feel is, "Oh *****" face when she opened the door with the Septon ready to marry, made up for that.


I didn't recognize what was happening at first with the septon and all, but when i did i burst up laughing.
909	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-04	Duuuuuude! Karl is fucking amazing with those knives! WOW!
Im just glad Ghost got to gnaw on someone's dome!


Â 
FOOKING LEGEND Â<U+0099>
Â 
And yeah, it's about time Ghost got to pad his Killsheet.
910	Colonel Green	2014-05-04	I can't decide whether Robin knowing who "Alayne" is (which is a harmless change, incidentally, based on the published material; and presumably also according to the unpublished) is just the writers half-assing this whole secret identity thing, or because they want Sansa to have somebody other than Littlefinger to talk to openly next year.
911	Natalie Underfoot	2014-05-04	I felt like this episode was classic Cersei: giving away the horse to achieve what you want in the moment. Constantly thinking she's the smartest one in the room and not realizing that Marg was so on to her with the "sister or mother" comment. Â Cersei's problem has always been that what she wants to accomplish is always too tied to emotions and it makes her act desperate. Â Things just get worse after Tywin dies because at least she trusts him.Â 
Â 
Loved that the girl Karl was abusing was the one to put the knife in his back. Not surprised all the women were basically like "everything with a dick needs to pack it on up and get out of our site."Â 
Â 
Didn't care about the Jon Arryn reveal and loved the look on Sansa's face when she heard about marrying Sweet Robin. I kinda like Sansa knowing the score with Lyssa right away, will be interesting to see how she moves forward the next few episodes.Â 
Â 
Arya and the Hound, filler but I love them. Â Craster's Keep was wrapped us as best as they could but felt it was more about needing to give Jon a "leadership" moment outside of the wall since Thorne is still around (the butterfly effect GRRM talked about). Â Also, with Locke eliminated sticking by my theory that Bowen Marsh will be comign in next season for Eastwatch by the Sea. My theory is that's where Stannis lands before moving inland
912	VeturKemur	2014-05-04	Actually, it makes me wonder if BR had a hand in freeing Ghost, because the ravens started to caw and suddenly the door is open and Ghost is gone.


I assumed Hodor and co. let him out when they rescued Summer. The caws could have been used to add to Rast's anxiety about Ghost being free and nowhere to be seen. That's what I got from it anyway.

					
					
							Edited by Vetur Kemur, 04 May 2014 - 10:27 PM.
913	Rockroi	2014-05-04	So, a relatively pedestrian episode, but definitely better than the previous two weeks.
Â 
Becayuse in the end, they treat women badly everywhereâ<U+0080>¦.
Â 
What I liked:
Â 
The Hero: Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Snowâ<U+0080><U+0099>s liberation of Craterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Keep- and lets just forget the convenient plot device of Bran et al for a moment â<U+0080><U+0093> was a very well-done and focused scene.Â  I greatly appreciate the construction of the event- set up and delivery were all well done.Â  But maybe the highlight was that- at long last â<U+0080><U+0093> a hero â<U+0080>¦ acted like a hero and did something â<U+0080>¦heroic.Â Â  When that moment is taken for its own identity- that good people donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t deserve to have terrible things happen to them and that those with power should use that power to help them â<U+0080><U+0093> we can see the true greatness of not only Jon but of any character in the series.Â 
Â 
It was yet another sincere example about how â<U+0080><U+009C>show Jonâ<U+0080><U+009D> is a vastly superior product than â<U+0080><U+009C>book Jon.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
And nice cameo by Ghost.Â 
Â 
The Scars of the Vale: Lysa Arynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mania was perfectly captured in her compulsive hatred of all those things pretty: Lysa Â and Cat.Â  But more â<U+0080><U+0093> her desperation to please the man she thinks knows everything.Â  While we can all marvel at Littlefingerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s plot-building, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a gigantic example of how cruel this world can be to people who are born and bread to be helpless.Â  Just as Hoster Tully screwed up raising Lysa, so did Ned and Cat not properly prepare the world for Sansa.Â  This has catapulted Sansa into this universe that is undeniably cruel to her- multiple kidnappings, marriages, and a feeling of free-fall as she is now in the clutches of an incredibly horrible LYsa- in some cases, literally in her clutches.Â  That scene with Lysa grabbing Sansa and holding her and watching as Sansa cries (yes- somebody tell m again how bad an actress she isâ<U+0080>¦. The woman is fucking amazing).Â 
Â 
And even as Lysa is screeching the words- that she poisoned Jon and got Cat to take Tyrion etcâ<U+0080>¦ - we heard Sansa start barking out statements about how stupid she was; how LF calls her stupid and canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t figure things out â<U+0080>¦
Â 
Except â<U+0080>¦ Peter never said ANY of that.Â  Sansa said that â<U+0080>¦. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s incredible â<U+0080><U+0093> she has imported her own self-hatred; her own-self-doubt, her own self-deception and translated it all into words.Â  Â SHE feels that way about herself; SHE hates that she does not have it all figured out; SHE hates that she canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be smarter or wittier or more understanding than the rest.Â 
Â 
And soâ<U+0080>¦ they really do torture girlsâ<U+0080>¦ everywhere. Even in their own heads. Â 
Â 
Where is the Gold Buried: Tywin has become the show-runnersâ<U+0080><U+0099> binkie: he has been an intragal part of every episode since â<U+0080><U+009C>Blackwaterâ<U+0080><U+009D> and once again he dropped bombs on the audience and dragged out the truth for others to comprehend.Â  And he agreed with Cersei, which si no small feat.Â 
Â 
A Pod Mod: I always liked Pod and the show has added more dimension to him and given his character; here is that he does well even when he has no idea what he is doing.Â  Because of all of Podâ<U+0080><U+0099>s characteristics, determination seems to be his most endearing.
Â 
Just like Brienne.Â 
Â 
The Regency of Pain: Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s view of the world was spot-on; girls- women â<U+0080><U+0093> are hurt everywhere. And crowing about how good you are does not change that. Â I liked how even Obyrn was aware of how hollow his words were when faced with Cersei's understanding of what a society does to their women. Â There is a lot about Cersei not to like, but one thing we all know- she loves her children and knows the pain they are in. Better than Anyone. Â Because a woman knows...Â 
Â 
I am the One Who Makes the List: Aryaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scenes were exceptional (and I enjoyed her water-dancing), but in the end, the greatest swordsman who ever lived is dead because a man with a sword and armor killed him.Â  And the Hound told everyone- including Internet-conspiracy wonks- just how true that was.Â 
Â 
A Hodor Knows: As super-cool as it was to watch Hodor snap an assholeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s neck at the shoulder (fuck â<U+0080>¦ me ), the scene were Hodor sees blood on his hands spoke volumes.Â  Bran took the free-will of another human being and used it for his own ends; he used Hodor as a means to an ends at the expense of Hodorâ<U+0080><U+0099>s free-will Â and humanity.Â  IT odes not matter how good of an act it was, when Hodor looks down and sees a dead man and blood on his own handsâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
â<U+0080>¦ all I know is Tywin Lannister would have been proud.Â  And the Stark apologists canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t tell me itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not all the same thing.
Â 
Â 
What I am on the Fence About:
Â 
A Lannister Always Pays His Debtsâ<U+0080>¦ But We are a Little Short This Week: Wealth does not require gold-mines but and I understand why the West may run out of gold (all gold mines do, eventually), but the idea that the Lannisters are empty is a littleâ<U+0080>¦ convenient.Â  I found it unnecessary, but it also can be an opportunity for the show to expound on other ideas.Â  Regardless, it left me underwhelmed.Â 
Â 
Bran: A Completely Adequate Set of Scenes: So, other than the fact that Jojen may burn to the Red God (â<U+0080>¦.mehâ<U+0080>¦.), I didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t MIND Branâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scenesâ<U+0080>¦ other than make me wish they didn't;â<U+0080><U+0099>t have to have them in the first place.Â  They were fine; I thought they saved some time and the actorâ<U+0080><U+0099>s SAG credits.Â  HE can get paid in good conscious.Â  At the same timeâ<U+0080>¦ why?Â  Was any of that necessary?Â  I get why they did it and I can see it better, but ultimately I am left with the ringing in my ear of the contrived nature of all of it.Â  I am glad its over (just as unresolved, pointless, and â<U+0080><U+009C>Wea re Right Back Where We Startedâ<U+0080><U+009D> Nature of it all).Â  A bait-and-switch and none of it made much sense at all.Â  Butâ<U+0080>¦ heyâ<U+0080>¦ at least Bran was thereâ<U+0080>¦ right?
Â 
What I did Not Like:
Â 
Did Weseroes Shrink: No Varys (how many lines has he had this season? 4?); no Bronn, no Jaime, no Stannis, no dragons (sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s captured 3 cities and weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen them once), no Tyrion.Â  No Tyrion.Â  Look, I get it that there is more to this show than â<U+0080>¦ the good stuff, but why are we wasting time with the thread-bare edges of the story when the main courses are going to waste?Â  Did we forget the stuff we actually like? Â The show has to do more with less.Â  You got 10 episodes and this one felt like we spent a lot more time on a lot less.Â 
Â 
But heyâ<U+0080>¦ join us next week when we get to watch Stannis Baratheon fill out a loan application.Â  Â Â Remember when he stormed a beach?Â  Now watch him storm complex interest.Â 
Â 
This has to change. Â Â
914	johnnysd	2014-05-04	I personally don't mind the Jon Arryn reveal coming this early. I hated that exposition dump in the books prior to the murder attempt: cheesy villain(ess) monologuing, very clumsy writing.Â  This breaks it up a little. It's still clumsy, but it won't break up the tension in the scene where Lysa is trying to kill Sansa with a bunch of expository villainess monologuing explaining in great detail exactly what Lysa's deal is. Likewise for the scene with Sansa in this episode where Lysa shows her crazy, jealous side early on.


Â 
Â 
Agree wholeheartedly. I always thought that scene did not really work in the books, while the other guy thought it was jaw dropping good. I could argue it is better revealed in the show. Except three years on, not sure unsullied care or remember.Â
915	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-04	Â 
4. White washing Dany some more

HORSESHIT. This episode told us what her actions ended up causing. Dany decides shes in Slaver's Bay for the long haul and the audience collectively groans.
Â 
Â 


When he readies his knives as bows to "Lord Snow", my heart started racing. Shit was perfectly executed. I think it's awesome that Jon can't actually defeat him in single combat, because the way Craster's wife does him in is just way more compelling than him losing outright.


Yeah. Jon isnt Balls-To-The-Wall-Awesome yet. Hes still got a ways to go before he can smush everything. So i found it more believable that Karl was really quick and tough for Jon to beat. Plus those girls deserved some payback. Longclaw through the fucken dome was epic.
Â 


Â 
They are both excellent in their own right. Book is better in some ways, and the show has improved the story in others.


I agree with this.
Â 


Â 
FOOKING LEGEND Â<U+0099>
Â 
And yeah, it's about time Ghost got to pad his Killsheet. 


Heehee! Ghost's reunion with Jon was nice. BEAST! I got pretty sad that Jon didnt even see Bran. That kinda broke my heart.Â 
Â 

Â 
Becayuse in the end, they treat women badly everywhereâ<U+0080>¦.

917	WeStillKnowNothingJonSnow	2014-05-04	yeah, the writers are making a lot of gaffes this season an they are more noticeable it seems. informing robin about sansa's true identity. he casually mentions the death of sansa's parent without showing any awareness of empathy and giving little concern for being discrete. smooth move d&d

Â 
I never liked Beric and Stoneheart as developments. It's yet to be seen what the point of Stoneheart is. Â Each of them were raised pretty much out of the blue. At least with Syrio there is a bit of a question as to whether he's dead or not.Â

It was really pointless. Just like you said, they're right back where they were. I know that they had to fill Bran's story with something, but the whole thing was so weird I honestly would rather Bran have less scenes than all that nonsense.Â
930	Tom son of Tom	2014-05-04	Â  It was so random and sudden I bet a bunch of viewers weren't even paying attention to what she was saying.Â  
Exactly. I wonder even if show viewers realize the gravity of her actions she had just confessed to.
931	johnnysd	2014-05-04	Â 
Â 
All in all, the show is straying further and further from the books.Â  This might be a good thing though, since the show will likely catch up to GRRM before he finishes the series, maybe its for the best if it has its own, unique, completely different ending.Â  So, instead of nitpicking in the future, I'm going to try to enjoy the show more for being its own unique breed.Â 


Â 
Actually I thought this episode got them right back in line to hit all the major plotpoints. It is less off the rails than last week
932	ebevan91	2014-05-04	Arya added Beric & Thoros to her prayer? That's . . . weird. Could that be leading to something in the future between her and the BWB? Spoiler?



I'm guessing it's a show-canon thing because they took Gendry.
933	Colonel Green	2014-05-04	Umm there were swords pretty much lying around the room.


And by the time he stooped to pick one up, he would be dead.

934	JesterX	2014-05-04	Total character deviation for Cersei.Â  NO WAY would she ever confess her displeasure with Joffrey to anyone outside of the family.
935	Obebb	2014-05-04	Exactly. I wonder even if show viewers realize the gravity of her actions she had just confessed to.


Â 
Yeah. It was so "la la la oh yeah I killed my husband btw just gonna say that out loud to you Petyr for no reason yeah whatever who cares!"
936	wvfaerywoman	2014-05-04	.Just a thought about why Arya added Beric and Thoros to her list...selling Gendry out to the red woman. Show!Arya lumps all three of them together as probably responsible for something nasty happening to Gendry. If she was all hot to avenge Lommy, it makes sense she'd want to avenge Gendry. She didn't have this reason in the books.
937	When Harry met Sansa	2014-05-04	I feel his, "Oh *****" face when she opened the door with the Septon ready to marry, made up for that.


Haha it was on par for sure. But one can never get enough of Aidan Gillen derp-face.Â
938	Arkash	2014-05-04	Great episode ! One nitpicking : not enough Dolorous Edd !
939	Natalie Underfoot	2014-05-04	Â 
Yeah. It was so "la la la oh yeah I killed my husband btw just gonna say that out loud to you Petyr for no reason yeah whatever who cares!"


It does when combined with the fact that although she was acting nice she totally felt threatened by Sansa. That was her reminder to him, also why she had the Septon there. She is crazy but she gets her shit locked down.
940	JesterX	2014-05-04	Does anyone agree that the show seems to be trying hard NOT to catch up with the books?Â  Which would explain all of the recent deviations?
941	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-04	Total character deviation for Cersei.Â  NO WAY would she ever confess her displeasure with Joffrey to anyone outside of the family.


Uhhh she was obviously fishing Marg to find out if she had any idea of the murder. It was so obvious Cersei was fishing, it was like "hurrr". Not exactly out of character for her.Â

Not really.Â  They've just structured the show around key stopping points for each plot in a given season, which for some means coming up with additional material.

Â 
nope.
946	johnnysd	2014-05-04	Â 
I never liked Beric and Stoneheart as developments. It's yet to be seen what the point of Stoneheart is. Â Each of them were raised pretty much out of the blue. At least with Syrio there is a bit of a question as to whether he's dead or not.Â 


Â 
The worse thing is that GRRM will likely resurrect Jon. I have always felt that the resurrections permanently diminished the series. When Ned died it was like BAM the main character can die and really be dead and no silly fantasy resurrection, then GRRM blew it and made it commonplace.
947	Bear Claw	2014-05-04	I noticed Oberyn mentioned hisÂ  daughters- one in particular.Â  I wonder if they will cast one Sand Snake.
948	JesterX	2014-05-04	Uhhh she was obviously fishing Marg to find out if she had any idea of the murder. It was so obvious Cersei was fishing, it was like "hurrr". Not exactly out of character for her.Â 


Â 
Cersei's not the brightest but she would have to be a COMPLETE idiot to think she'd get Margaery to confess any knowledge or complicity in Joffrey's death.Â  She wasn't fishing.
949	jaimecersei	2014-05-04	lmao cersei was so shady in tonights episode i loved it
950	Onna Lewyys	2014-05-04	Does anyone agree that the show seems to be trying hard NOT to catch up with the books?Â  Which would explain all of the recent deviations?

They have to kill time until Ep 9.
951	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-04	Strangely, I'm not upset about the early Jon Arryn reveal necessarily. I'm upset about the omnipotence of Lysa's madness. I think what takes the "oh shit" out of "Only Cat" is front-loading Lysa's madness before it happens. She was a lot eviller to Sansa than she ever was to Cat in Season 1. She basically breastfed and gave the middle finger to Cat that she wouldn't help, while she's killing Sansa with lemon cakes tonight.
Â 
When you know someone is balloons crazy, you expect them to do just about anything. "Only Cat" isn't a reveal of just her as the murderer, but also a reveal and undeniable confirmation aboutÂ just how far her insanity extends.
952	jaimecersei	2014-05-04	Â 
Cersei's not the brightest but she would have to be a COMPLETE idiot to think she'd get Margaery to confess any knowledge or complicity in Joffrey's death.Â  She wasn't fishing.


Â 
i dont think she was fishing about the murder but i do think she was trying to figure margaery out. margaery fucked up with the "sister or mother" line tbh
953	JesterX	2014-05-04	Not really.Â  They've just structured the show around key stopping points for each plot in a given season, which for some means coming up with additional material.


Â 
That's essentially the same point.Â  The "stopping points" you mentionedÂ ensures they don't catch up to the books.Â
954	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-04	Â 
Cersei's not the brightest but she would have to be a COMPLETE idiot to think she'd get Margaery to confess any knowledge or complicity in Joffrey's death.Â  She wasn't fishing.


Yes she was. That entire conversation was fishing. All of it. She was mostly aiming at Tommen, but dropping Joff in there to see Marg's reaction.Â 

Â 
Exactly. I wonder even if show viewers realize the gravity of her actions she had just confessed to.

This is rubbish. My parentsÂ both made gasping, shocked noises at that. Yeah, even Dad. I really wish you people would give unsullied some freaking credit.
955	Obebb	2014-05-04	I noticed Oberyn mentioned hisÂ  daughters- one in particular.Â  I wonder if they will cast one Sand Snake.

I didn't like him calling Elia difficult. That's more of an Ellaria thing to say. But I am glad they were mentioned.
956	Colonel Green	2014-05-04	That's essentially the same point.Â  The "stopping points" you mentionedÂ ensures they don't catch up to the books.Â 


No.Â  The stopping points are where it makes the most sense dramatically to end a season.Â  It's not for the purpose of keeping behind the books.

i dont think she was fishing about the murder but i do think she was trying to figure margaery out. margaery fucked up with the "sister or mother" line tbh

Â 
Jon's a bit different though since his purpose in the series really is not finished; his assassination comes so abruptly just as things are starting to move. Catelyn and Beric in retrospect seem to be precursors to however Jon comes back. But I agree when I first saw them I thought GRRM had jumped the shark into fantasy claptrap. The jury is still out on it for me.Â
960	jobmartell	2014-05-04	I am sorry, but this was just bad. Not interesting, not subtle, not intelligently written... Dull... I am all for praises when deserved but this week was just bad...
Â 
There were some moments I liked but overall impression is rather bad:
Â 
1. Cersei... Especially liked how she saw through Margaery's sweet face... Although that conversation come from God knows where, it was kinda nice
2. Vale... This was all messed up... But thumbs up for the worst plausible romance
3. Bran and Jon not meeting... I liked that... It honored the book material in season where the same was ripped apart.
4. And so we begin with Meereenese plot
5. Oberyn... I mean he can appear just sitting and meditating and I would like the guy...
Â 
Brienne and Pod's conversation was pointless, Locke was pointless... Someone should tell Mis Clarke that badassery works to a point. The reunion between Jon and Ghost was underwhelming. Just bad... I didn't like it.

Yes and yes. Rather pointless. Not to mention the SF debates now that have sprung up do to the hound.
961	jaimecersei	2014-05-04	Â 
I think that was a polite "fuck you" from Margaery.


Â 
it was obviously a polite "fuck you" but also a fuck up from margaery imo. it wasnt exactly very subtle.........
962	JesterX	2014-05-04	Yes she was. That entire conversation was fishing. All of it. She was mostly aiming at Tommen, but dropping Joff in there to see Marg's reaction.


Â 
Gotta disagree there.Â  I'd buy that she might've wanted to cozy up to Margaery for future purposes since she was a lot friendlier to her than the past.Â  But I don't think she thought she'd get Margaery to say anything.
963	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-04	Overall solid episode. Â Jon and NW part was badass. Â Happy I wasn't on the 'Locke is gonna be Bowen Marsh or something' bandwagon.
Â 
I'm happy that Bran booked it before talking to Jon. Â Jojen was right that Jon would impede on their journey.
Â 
Weird thinking that Jon and Bran haven't spoke to each other since the pilot.
Â 
The next episode looks like it has potential to be the best this season.Â 


I agree next episode looks great but I doubt it will be the best this season. The last 3 episodes are going to be full of huge moments.Â
964	RoamingRonin	2014-05-04	The conversations I've had with some Unsullied make me wonder if we're even watching the same show.


Â 
Unsullied I know have trouble with names and relations but they keep track of the plots well enough. They seem like readers going through the series for the first time.Â
965	Pib_Juju	2014-05-04	Didn't mind the Jon Arryn reveal at all-- it actually seems almost comparable to Joffrey's line about the dagger, and Tyrion finally realizing it was Joff who tried to have Bran killed way back in season one. That's ancient history now, in television terms.
Â 
While Jon Arryn's killer is a big reveal in the books, it just doesn't seem all that important in the show at this point, and would actually seem pretty absurd if coupled with that intense later scene and played up like a climactic reveal. 'Hey, remember that character you liked who died in season one when he was investigating the death of a character you never actually saw? No? Well, strap in, viewer, because the answer to Sean Beane's murder investigation that you didn't really get (and actually wonder if it was in Lord of the Rings and not Game of Thrones, come to think of it), is the climactic reveal of tonight's episode!!!'
966	JesterX	2014-05-04	No.Â  The stopping points are where it makes the most sense dramatically to end a season.Â  It's not for the purpose of keeping behind the books.


Â 
I think it's PRIMARLY to keep it behind the books.Â  The season finale's for this show tend to not be very dramatic.Â The most climactic episodes of the season tend to be one or two shows BEFORE the finale.
967	marsyao	2014-05-04	I noticed Oberyn mentioned hisÂ  daughters- one in particular.Â  I wonder if they will cast one Sand Snake.

Unsullied I know have trouble with names and relations but they keep track of the plots well enough. They seem like readers going through the series for the first time.Â 


Yeah this. I know a few people who are unsullied but they rewatch, which is like rereading. Â They pick up on junk they missed and put the pieces together.Â 

Â 
While Jon Arryn's killer is a big reveal in the books, it just doesn't seem all that important in the show at this point

The astute viewer is going to notice the impact and what it means as a part of Littlefinger's game.Â
969	Obebb	2014-05-04	Â 
Unsullied I know have trouble with names and relations but they keep track of the plots well enough. They seem like readers going through the series for the first time.Â 


Â 
I don't mean to say that all unsullied can't keep track of the plot. I know that most of them are absolutely fine with everything. I'm just saying that some of them, especially with how suddenly that Lysa confession was thrown out there, probably had no idea what was happening and it's not like that's crazy to say.
970	Longspear Ryk	2014-05-04	also i don't think their white washing cersei, she's just trying to get people on her side against tyrion

My parentsÂ both made gasping, shocked noises at that. Yeah, even Dad. I really wish you people would give unsullied some freaking credit.Yeah, I think a lot of people underestimate how much someone who hasn't read the books can 'understand' the show. I didn't read the books until after the first season of the show, and I wasn't lost when watching it. Some people may not follow it well, but many do- whether they've read the books or not.
972	Darth Pipes	2014-05-04	I think I would have been fine with the Lannister gold mines revealed if they had used the war and Robb's raids as the reason their gold had run out.
Â 
Oh, I did like the mention of King Cleon the Butcher, of Astapor.Â  I always kind of dug the idea of that character.

Â 
I liked the resurrection of Donderion, because he was such a minor character and the whole thing seemed so creepy, sad, and bizarre. Didn't like Catelyn being resurrected at all-- it felt cheap somehow, I agree.
974	Obebb	2014-05-04	Get smarter friends.Â

975	Colonel Green	2014-05-04	Â 
it was obviously a polite "fuck you" but also a fuck up from margaery imo. it wasnt exactly very subtle.........


Cersei has made her stance on Margaery perfectly clear before that point.Â  There's really nothing to be lost in jabbing her.
976	Lord Godric	2014-05-04	also i don't think their white washing cersei, she's just trying to get people on her side against tyrion


I think that is obvious too, she's telling people things to make them feel for her and be on her side against Tyrion. Â I sort of wish they had done a little more to show her resistance to wanting to marry Loras, however. Â
977	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-04	I think I would have been fine with the Lannister gold mines revealed if they had used the war and Robb's raids as the reason their gold had run out.

Cleon...yes. The viewership's opinion on Dany begins to change...i love it!Â 
*bounces* i love it so much. (my father's almost disgruntled sound at her statement of staying really drove it all home.)

They aren't on GRRM's schedule, nor should they be. They aren't padding the story to make it last longer, they are moving things around and adding in bits to make sure that all of the characters get the necessary screen time and don't end up disappearing for an entire season.
980	Colonel Green	2014-05-04	The season finale's for this show tend to not be very dramatic.Â The most climactic episodes of the season tend to be one or two shows BEFORE the finale.


What does that have to do with anything?
Â 
Each character's story has to have a seasonal arc, and they have to try and keep all the characters roughly in sync.Â  Some characters went through most of their book 3 material last season, but still have good stopping points at the end of that book, so they have to have their remaining material spread out.Â  Others are into the later books, or have so little material that stuff has to be invented to keep the stories loosely in sync.
981	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-04	Gonna miss Burn Gorman.Â  Such a tremendous performance tucked into even an ultimately minor role.
Â 
Still, he's cleared away at just the right time: Iwan Rheon is back in action as Ramsay next week to keep the villain flag flying strong and [*sigh* one last time] THE FOOKING LEGEND OF GIN ALLEY Â<U+0099> was a more than suitable filler of the gap.
982	Lord Godric	2014-05-04	I think the primary reason for them having the Lannister mines run dry is to once again make the Iron Bank of Braavos prominent. Â But I can't tell what they're trying to set up with this. Â There have been so many mentions of the bank so far this season. Â I mean what are they planning to do, make the faceless men agents of the Bank or something?Â
983	Fragile Bird	2014-05-04	The whole plot line of Bran being there, unknown to Jon, was reminiscent of a soap opera.Â  The Days of our Game of Thrones Lives.
Â 
I assume that Jojen's burning hand had absolutely nothing to do with R'hllor, but a vision only he saw, of the way he was going to die.
984	wvfaerywoman	2014-05-04	After reading the prologue of got again today, I am leaning toward the opinion that the resurrection done by Mel and the Others have to be connected, so as much as I hate Stoneheart and Beric, they might be important foreshadowing for the end game. Jon has two options to live on, warming or Mel.
985	hedgeknight001	2014-05-04	Pouring one out (of a skull) for THE FOOKING LEGEND OF GIN ALLEY Â<U+0099>, you were a fantastic dickhead.Â  Hopefully Burn Gorman is on to a bigger and brighter future, perhaps including the lead role in a Willem Defoe biopic.

THE FOOKING LEGEND OF GIN ALLEYâ<U+0084>c.
This show does do dickheads well.
986	Jameson Snow	2014-05-04	Â This whole "unsullied" thing is kinda lame IMO. The overall connotation feels pretty condescending and it's rather unfair to categorize the entirety of all non book readers that way. I know some people who only watch the show and keep up with it better than people who have read the books. It all depends on the person and how invested in this story they choose to be.
Â 
Â Also, I'm in the camp of Cersei totally faking her way through that convo with Margaery. Pretty surprised so many "sullied" think otherwise.,
987	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-04	Oh and I know a lot of stuff gets lost in the shuffle because this thread flies by a mile a minute on episode night, but:
Â 
Â 

But heyâ<U+0080>¦ join us next week when we get to watch Stannis Baratheon fill out a loan application.Â  Â Â Remember when he stormed a beach?Â  Now watch him storm complex interest.Â 


Â 
This really was a tremendous line.Â  I salute this.
988	Fat Trell	2014-05-04	I think television audiences are incredibly underrated here. You can have long-running shows with complex histories and plots without telegraphing every detail. HBO has had a handful in the past five years alone.
Â 
The lack of subtlety is not a reality of television, its a mark against the show-runners.Â
989	JesterX	2014-05-04	What does that have to do with anything?

Â 
Again, you're essentially making the same point.Â  When you say "keep all the characters roughly in sync", in sync wiith what?Â  The books, correct?Â  So that would mean they're trying to stay behind the books.
990	juanml82	2014-05-04	Total character deviation for Cersei.Â  NO WAY would she ever confess her displeasure with Joffrey to anyone outside of the family.she did, to Sansa, in both books and show. She had no reason to see Sansa as a rival, though
991	Darth Pipes	2014-05-04	Gonna miss Burn Gorman.Â  Such a tremendous performance tucked into even an ultimately minor role.
Â 
Still, he's cleared away at just the right time: Iwan Rheon is back in action as Ramsay next week to keep the villain flag flying strong and [*sigh* one last time] THE FOOKING LEGEND OF GIN ALLEY Â<U+0099> was a more than suitable filler of the gap.


Â 
Gorman is currently on Turn, where he plays a very entertaining villain.Â  I guess he's still around on the show.
992	Bran's Legs	2014-05-04	I gotta say I feel bad for Hodor.Â  I wish they could have escaped without Bran warging Hodor.Â  Hodor with Locke's blood on his hand made me very sad for Hodor. That really was a violation of Hodor as a person, and it was so different from Bran accidentally warging him to calm him down at Queenscrown. 


Seemed like the only option, and you knew that it would happen at some point.Â
993	Lord Godric	2014-05-04	I know the Bran stuff was all a deviation from the book, but I love the way Jojen is being played and what was shown tonight. Â It all seems to be spoilery regarding Bran's final fate and Jojen's as well. Â Jojen was obviously "burning" so I imagine there will be a confrontation with Melisandre eventually..
Â 
Oh, but I really just wanted him to say 'this is not the day i die'Â

No, in sync with each other.Â  You can't have Arya spending the entire season going through her Braavos material when everybody else is still back in ASOS.
995	Ginevra	2014-05-04	Or a cousin. Nieces and nephews can also be the children of cousins.
First cousins once removed would be the relationship with children of cousins.

Yeah its kind of the same as the first season when she tells Catelyn about her first son with Robert and praying for Bran to wake up. It's obviously an act.Â
997	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-04	Gonna miss Burn Gorman.Â  Such a tremendous performance tucked into even an ultimately minor role.
Â 
Still, he's cleared away at just the right time: Iwan Rheon is back in action as Ramsay next week to keep the villain flag flying strong and [*sigh* one last time] THE FOOKING LEGEND OF GIN ALLEY Â<U+0099> was a more than suitable filler of the gap.


Dude, the preview for next week has Ramsay all shirtless.Â  Â HBO, that shit aint cool. How dare you make the worst guy in the series, actually pretty cut. Ugh.... I liked Karl's stint of horrible villainy. Gave a reason for guys in the Watch to find Jon awesome.
Â 


I think the primary reason for them having the Lannister mines run dry is to once again make the Iron Bank of Braavos prominent. Â But I can't tell what they're trying to set up with this. Â There have been so many mentions of the bank so far this season. Â I mean what are they planning to do, make the faceless men agents of the Bank or something?Â 


The Iron Bank mentions seem so heavyhanded that i have to assume theres a Faceless Man connection. Even my parents are noticing a possible connection. So maybe Jaqen, at very least, was sent by the Iron Bank to collect from the crown. And wound up in the Black Cells for his troubles. I dunno.
Â 


I assume that Jojen's burning hand had absolutely nothing to do with R'hllor, but a vision only he saw, of the way he was going to die.


I thought it had to do with him dying out there beyond the Wall and them burning him to keep him from being wighted. All i know is that JOJENPASTE IS FUCKING DEAD. 
Â 

Â 
, but I love the way Jojen is being played and what was shown tonight.Â 

Me too. Im not sure i buy him getting torched by Mel. But its possible. I tend to subscribe to the idea he dies of illness and the CotF burn him.Â
998	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-05-04	Can someone possibly explain Bran's actions? Â We're captured - good. Â Hodor is being tortured - good. Â Women all around us are being raped and abused - good. Â Maera is about to be raped - good.
Â 
Locke shows up - ok, this has gone on JUST long enough, and NOW it's time to warg into Hodor (nevermind the fact that he recently had a spear put through his leg) and get us out of here.
Â 
WTF???
999	Jameson Snow	2014-05-04	No, in sync with each other.Â  You can't have Arya spending the entire season going through her Braavos material when everybody else is still back in ASOS.


Â Wait... so in sync with each other... according to the books? That's still the books, haha.

Â 
It's strange, but here's what I choose to believe.Â  Hodor could not have fought off all the men, so warging into him earlier would have unnecessarily sacrificed Hodor's life.Â  If the rape of Meera had continued and the men hadn't been distracted by Jon & co, Bran would have warged Hodor to save her (there were only 3 of the bad guys there I think, so the odds were more reasonable).

Yeah, the Iron Bank, at least in the show, is Too Big To Fail. A faceless man tie in definitely makes sense here.

i don't know if Bran can always warg into Hodor. Â We know from the books that he only did it once (at this point) and it was in absolute desperation to get Hodor to stop screaming, Â I don't think it's something that comes to Bran's mind as one of his abilities.Â
1004	Lord Godric	2014-05-04	Â 
Yeah, the Iron Bank, at least in the show, is Too Big To Fail. A faceless man tie in definitely makes sense here.


It certainly would be easier for the show to explain that the Iron Bank needs a "security" force like the Faceless Men than to delve into another new religious aspect. Â So, the more I think about it the more I see that happening as well.Â
1005	Jasta11	2014-05-04	It's funny to see people blast the show for its lack of subtlety, then have it whoosh past their head when the writers do display it. Cercei is obviously buttering up the judges for her trial. Using the ''family legacy'' angle on Tywin, the ''avenging our loved ones'' on Oberyn, and making false ammends towards Marge who is the brains behind her oaf of a father. Just look at her face when Marge calls her ''mother''. She's obviously holding back the screams.
Â 
For the people who say that this differs from Book!Cercei, I say: good. Book Cercei is a one-note, bitchy dumbass. She's entertaining to read about in a ''oh my god how stupid can she get?'' way, but she's not a multi-layered, grey character, especially from book 4 onwards. If the show decides to inject some cunning and/or sympathy in her, all the better. She's already far more interesting than her book counterpart.
Â 
Not a fan of the Lannisters no longer having any gold, however. Not sure what it brings to the story. And like some have said, it makes Tyrion's eventual quest for Casterly Rock seem pretty pointless. We'll see how it plays out. Other thoughts:
Â 
- Loved Arya and the Hound. About time someone gave the she-wolf a reality check on how useful her dingy little blade actually is against anyone that's not already at her mercy. And she still wants the Hound dead.
Â 
- Dorky Pod could get old, but at least they got some development into him.
Â 
- Crazy Lysa was great. Loved LF's ''Do not want'' looks as she kissed him. And the screams they kept from the book, too. Poor Sansa.
Â 
- And let the Dany sitting around doing fuck-all phase commence. I really hope they at least try to spice it up so that it's not as boring as in the books. At least the illusion of perfect little Khalessi effortlessly freeing everyone and crapping rainbows is finally shattered.
Â 
- I'm really sad to see Locke go. He was one of the better show additions, certainly miles beyond Vargo Hoat and his gang of clowns. On the other hand I liked the scene, including Hodor looking in horror at his blood-soaked hands. I'm glad they highlighted the fallout of Bran possessing a simple man. Also liked the foreshadowing by Jojen.
Â 
- Attack on Craster's was nice, but the general fight was off. The show has just said that there were 11 men at the Keep, with no sentries, and Jon had, what, 6 guys total on his ranging including himself? Then his group charges into battle screaming like maniacs and start cutting down what seems like 20 or 30 guys, while losing 5 people which doesn't fit with his numbers. Liked the fight with Carl fucking Tanner, and to me it makes sense a fresh guy with daggers who was the best assassin in King's Landing would beat Jon, who's much less experienced, tired, using a sword in close quarters and learned to fight against armored/honorable opponents.
Â 
Good episode overall, but one of the season's weakest (which says a lot about the season's quality more than anything else IMO). But next week looks great.
1006	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-04	Did they sort out the Loras-Cersei marriage pact?

It's called really weak writing. D&D improvise REALLY BADLY.
1008	pleonasm	2014-05-04	What a lifeless filler episode. So Craster's Keep was exactly as I feared, filler. An unnecessary detour, with the almost reunion of some Stark siblings thrown in, until we get to an eventual climax with the Wildlings. Even the battle scenes looked completely staged with little to no sense of drama. And what was with Locke's insane kidnapping of Bran plan? He is going to take him back over the Wall to the Bolton's? What the hell? Sigh...
Â 
If anything, this season is confirming my worst fears. I have no issue with any attempt to go off book, but Benioff and Weiss are just mediocre writing talents and it constantly shows. Lackluster dialogue, contrived scenes, and offering nothing more than superficial insight into the characters.

1009	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-04	Did they sort out the Loras-Cersei marriage pact?


Â 
Kinda sorta not really.Â  Cersei punted again in her convo with Tywin. "A fortnight" for Tommen to mourn Joff before marrying, and Cersei said "A fortnight" after that for marrying Loras, and then she changed the subject and Tywin started Economics Chat.
Â 
So yeah, Cersei is continuing her stalling.

They do have a human weather-vane with them. I think the timing of Hodor's hijacking is up to Jojen's nod. Â

Hodor's reaction to what was going on was really great. His shock and "wtf just happened? What did i just do?" expression...its pretty sad and kinda takes some of the heroism out of the moment. (which it should. Bran and the audience needs to realize just whats going on there.) I have to hand it to the actor. For someone whos basically got one line throughout the series, he can show what Hodor is really thinking.Â
1013	Fagatron	2014-05-04	Whoa, I did not expect this side of Cersei at all.

Really... You didn't read into her sauve manipulation of her three victims. Mama Lion's was hugging her victims while sharpening her Axe for the ImpS head. 
Oh how smooth she was with...
Margery she played like a fiddle. Touting the queen title for her... All while insuring that no more funny business will happen without her knowing and approving. But Marge I think saw through it while playing nice but spitting out should I call you sister or.... Wait for it..... Mother, or as we like to say, "you old bag!"
Lord Tywin, oh Daddy I will follow what you say. Just tell me what you plan to do about the imp. But she got shot down Tywin tells her straight out that he is a judge and can't be persuaded. Oh shit Cersi, you got played.. But wait a min daddy. You disowned Jamie for nothing more than him not following your plans for him and standing up to you. Oh what will you do for me your last and only loyal child? But don't forget daddy about the imp... Cheers!
Then she plays that snake like the charmer she is. She comes with guards unlike her father. She confides in him about her pain of losing her son to that of his sister and her child. She goes to state oh how she misses her daughter and wonders if she is alright. Making the dornish seem like vile vipers. Her Innocent daughter caught in their vile sex pits. Oh no she is shot down with the comment that they don't hurt little girls in dorne.  But Cersi won't be out played by the snake charmer and bam comes back with, "everywhere in the world they hurt little girls." Has she charmed the snake into her basket?
Lordy, lordy this was such a great episode...

So true.. So true.
1017	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-04	It's funny to see people blast the show for its lack of subtlety, then have it whoosh past their head when the writers do display it.

Â 
I'm one of those people who complains about the lack of subtlety and I still didn't notice at first that Cersei was simply acting out to play the judges. Sometimes, things pass over your head.
Â 
And, in Cersei's case, that's easy to miss because since the start of the show they have portrayed Cersei pretty much like a victim and a poor helpless mother, victim of everything and everybody, while we know that's not entirely true.
Â 
OTOH, Oberyn, Margaery and Tywin are also smart enough to know that there is something odd about Cersei being "nice".
Â 
Â 


Is Cersei just going to stall with no plan until daddy dies?


Â 
As we don't get a Cersei's POV before Tywin died, we can't tell if she was in the same situation in books. In book 3, we only have Tyrion's and Jaime's POVs as the closest thing to her mind, and she was quite desperate back then, asking Jaime for help to protect Tommen. Looks like she didn't have any plan, because she knew that Tywin Lannister isn't someone to be fooled.
Â 


Â 
Greyness does not make a character interesting. This notion that for a story to be entertaining the heroes and villains must be nighÂ indistinguishableÂ is simply wrong.

She didn't need a plan in the books, because the Tyrells refused to betroth her to Willas.

Â 
It wasn't the only thing that bothered her. Tywin wanted to marry her, and even Oberyn was considered. That's why she probably tried to seduced him during the trial.
Â 
Also, he worried about the regency of Tommen, because Tywin insisted on marry her off and she would be away from Tommen.
1020	Darth Pipes	2014-05-04	Yeah, they've let this marriage thing with Cersei and Loras drag out too long.Â  I understand eliminating certain characters but I think now it was a mistake to wipe away Willas.
Â 
In an interesting bit of irony, Bran ends up killing the man (through Hodor) that maimed Jaime Lannister.Â  Jaime will never know about that.
1021	Audrey Arryn	2014-05-04	Overall it was an okay episode, my favourite parts were the eyrie and crasters keep.
Â 
A bit nitpicky but it seems Tyrion is going to be continuously whitewashed and this time by Sansa, when she tried to defend him that he had no choice in the marriage.Â

Cersei in the show is not multiply layered. She is very much one note from the first season onwards. "Woe is I. Marred to aÂ brute, mother to a psychopath. Men take all my power."

You juster layered her.. " woe is me" marred to a brute. I should have been married to Jamie or if not at least to R! My son is sick son of a bitch, how will I control him? My father sends an imp and he takes my power, or tries too, my son doesn't listen to me he takes my power, my father and Jamie come back and take the last visage of power I have, my sex. One by forcing me on a homosexual. The other by being a lamed man who doesn't complete me anymore and rapes me on my sons death altar.
So what is a mother to do??? 
Well first I need to get rid of the imp. I need those judges to give me that imp's head! Oh I'll play nice to be them and stroke them, and mold them into my executioners. Because I know that if the imp is left to defend himself he'll slip out of the noose!
Seems to me she isn't so one noted as you stated. But lets face the facts George doesn't give Cersi any love, well maybe a little.  He did give her that awesome walk of shame.
1023	Fagatron	2014-05-04	Well, we know the outcome re Oberyn, don't we?

1026	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-05-05	At first I was like "Lysa is way too sane/normal." Then her scene with Sansa came up and I was like "Nevermind, this b*tch crazy."
Â 
Also, Bran's warging scene was badass.

Â 
Listing the ways she's been controlled by men doesn't make her complex. Its the same concept applied, just applied differently.
Â 
Having Cersei gain sympathy from the audience by being raped and abused by the men in her life over and over again is cheap. Its a simple and overused way to humanize female villains.

- Meera's almost-rape: "Wait, there's a female character we haven't sexualized or threatened with rape? Â I guess we'd better fix that."
Â 
- The early reveal about Jon Arryn's poisoning. Â This new placement really takes away from the importance of that information.

1034	Jay92	2014-05-05	Thought it was another really solid episode but I was hoping for the Jon Arryn reveal to be during Only Cat scene.Â
1035	Newstar	2014-05-05	- The Saint Tyrion distortion field still affecting Sansa. Â Her defense of him was a bit much. Â Also, toss that ring.
Â 
Yup.
Â 
Book Sansa, when asked about being made to marry Tyrion:Â  "They made me marry him. I never wanted it."
Â 
TV Sansa, when asked pretty much the same question: "They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to."
Â 
What is she still doing with that ring? It wouldn't bother me so much were it not for the extended closeups on her hands in the Lysa/Sansa scene. She was even wearing the ring in bed when she was trying to ignore Lysa's screams. Maybe the ring will be gone in the next episode with no explanation and that will be that, but I don't get why Sansa hasn't ditched the ring already, and I really don't get why she wouldn't have ditched it the moment she adopted the Alayne identity.

I agree that was my only issue with this episode.

Locke who?? Lol!
1038	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-05	Im thinking Sansa ditches the ring and stuff next time. They will likely have Lysa give her something to wear so she can fully change out of that stuff.
1039	Colonel Green	2014-05-05	They will likely have Lysa give her something to wear so she can fully change out of that stuff.


In the preview images we've seen of later episodes she's still wearing KL clothes (a different dress, in fact, then the one she has now, making that at least two dresses she still has apart from the one she was wearing when she escaped).Â  Not sure about the ring.

Yup. Â I think someone else mentioned it, but it would have been nice to have a few seconds of Petyr explaining her new identity. Â It would have been natural to have her take off the ring then.
1041	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-05	At first I was like "Lysa is way too sane/normal." Then her scene with Sansa came up and I was like "Nevermind, this b*tch crazy."
Â 
Also, Bran's warging scene was badass.


same as me, I was like "where the crazy go" then she had dinner with Sansa.

Greyness does not make a character interesting. This notion that for a story to be entertaining the heroes and villains must be nighÂ indistinguishableÂ is simply wrong.
Â 
Cersei in the show is not multiply layered. She is very much one note from the first season onwards. "Woe is I. Marred to aÂ brute, mother to a psychopath. Men take all my power."


Â 
Really? I thought that the hardest part of the battle between good and evil was to find who is which? Isin't the greyness the damn point of why this series is so well liked? Many people complain about Tyrion being white-washed, but when Cercei is made into something else than an Evil Queen straight out of a fairy tale (complete with Snow-White like prophecies about a younger and more beautiful queen) then she's suddendly not interesting? I just don't understand.
Â 
And Cercei in the show is hardly an angel. She's not supporting of Joff being a complete psycho, but she was still horrible to Tyrion and Sansa, as well as a ''villain'' by default for being against the Starks in the eyes of many, and several characters blast her for not being very smart. Hell, the very fact that she has conflicting opinions about her son (knows he was a cunt, still loved him) adds more layer than in the books where she seemed to live in a completely alternate reality where he was Jaehaerys I reborn.

Â 
I could have bought her keeping the ring out of habit until Petyr explained her new identity, but after, when she's already supposedly masquerading as Alayne? Makes no sense.
1044	Ruin	2014-05-05	Oberyn's conversation with Cersei could be huge later on, and I'm so glad he mentioned the Sand Snakes...I swear in season 5 if they cast Tyene; its been nice knowing you Tommen.
1045	PhoenixFlame	2014-05-05	I was really frackin' drunk but I'm pretty sure I would've enjoyed it a lot if sober.Â 
Â 
- Cersei! I like the layers. A lot. Lena Headey does amazing things. Too often characters in rough situations become "stronger" for it, a la Dowager Sophia von Habsburg. Like the hardass Dowager, some become scary for it. Cerse is unique in terms of character; it's not a tragic backstory that giving her viciousness a softer light (though certainly more context). It's also her current situation combined with her having some unsavory traits to begin with. It's like she's the grand sum of utterly wasted potential--not someone who failed at being a Machiavellian villainess, but someone who was never trained to be as such even though they possessed the raw aptitude. You wouldn't fault 6-year-old Jaime for not defeating Gregor in a swordfight when he was new to sword fighting. Cersei's always had the dregs. And that makes her very cranky. Gah I feel so sorry for her, but only because we're separated by a TV screen. At the same time...she's a coldhearted bitch. Love her, but no apologizing.Â 
Â 
- Tommen. Precious little bb boy needs some hugs and kittens.Â 
Â 
- Margaery and Cersei. I compare their â<U+0080><U+009C>getting alongâ<U+0080><U+009D> to Mark Lawrenceâ<U+0080><U+0099>s apt description two wildcats whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve put their aggression aside for the moment. Cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s beaten down and regrouping, Margaeryâ<U+0080><U+0099>s on cruise control until she re-establishes her lay of the land.Â 
Â 
- Tywin. Is it just me or does he look a bit tired?
Â 
- Jon Snow. I GET IT. Fangirls, I get it. Fuckin' Jon went from a 6 to a 9 when he was drenched in blood, a bit cut up, and dropping the faux-hoarseness.
Â 
- LYSA!!! Her warmth balanced precariously with her crazy. So so so good!! Â Her scene with Sansa. Holy shit.Â Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s like how no one can make you weep like relatives. I adore everything about her performance.Â 
Â 
- Sweet Robin. I was a bit perplexed at Uncle Baelish WEEEE! But,Â itâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll probably cast ambiguity on whose kid he is, which could be an interesting angle if Littlefingerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s clearly views him as nothing more than a meal ticket.Â 
Â 
- Oh hey Dany. Even on a giggly vodka tear I was scoffing at her Slaver's Bay project crumbling around her. I can't help it. Daario's "I heard you liked ships" should be a new fan slogan.
Â 
- Bran/Brandor - whoa shit got real! I did NOT expect Brandor to strangle Locke. JFC. AWESOMESAUCE! At least Locke got some fun bits beforehand. Ye shall be missed. Poor ol' bear.
Â 
- Jojen - reminding me of a Feist book I read in my youth, Shards of a Broken Crown. Will not attempt to explain the reference suffice it to say one of my happy buttons is sick/wounded people rising to the badass occasion.Â 
Â 
- Arya. Erm...going back and forth on the Hound cracking her in the face. I loved her sword not actually going through his armor. I KNOW he's a not a nice guy. But, he's never struck her, never struck Sansa. It kinda tweaked me. Then it didn't, 'cause I saw it as him giving her a relatively light (for him) smack to warn her how the next marauder she tries that on will probably break her jaw. Then I got confused again. I dunno. I didn't dislike it, I was just...ehhm....I dunno. Probably won't care in a week but I'm all swathed in feels.Â

1051	Uldra I	2014-05-05	Against sword and Dagger I would agree, but with a longsword against two daggers and no shield he should be able to hold him at a distance and get a few well placed thrusts in, but who cares really, it's only TV after all

Â 
I loved the Cersei and Oberyn scene. They don't like each other but they can still find common ground. AU where Cersei is engaged to Oberyn instead of Robert? The fur would fly but hot damn. Cersei talking about Myrcella killed me. She just couldn't fucking be hostile to Oberyn once he said how happy she was getting to play at the beach, except try to say "nah, don't beleive you." "No place is kind to little girls"Â  Â Oberyn's face, to my vodka-soaked eyes, seemed to be "you are a crazy bitch but damn I see what made you that way."

1054	When Harry met Sansa	2014-05-05	Finally finished tonight's ep. This was a pretty fun episode all the way through, starting with the obvious glee of more Aiden Gillen derp, which I was disappointed to see did not appear past the 20 minute mark but will undoubtedly return in "Mockingbird" .
Â 
Of all of the things that happened though, I actually did enjoy being spoiled this time around. We know now--and I think it's safe to say that this one isn't one that D&D invented, GRRM probably created it--that Jojen dies by fire. I'm pretty convinced that this will mean that Jojen is burned by Mel. We know that Mel sees Bran and BR and presumingly Jojen and Meera as servants of the Great Other and I think it's likely to conclude that if Jojen is to die by fire then he is taken/sacrifices himself and is burned by Mel.
Â 
In the books the last we know so far is that Jojen and Meera are still with Bran, BR and the gang and that he is very weak and depressed by the time they reach the cave. He wants to return to Greywater Watch but also has the greendream about it and realizes that has an unfavorable outcome. Mel has that vision where she sees Bran and co. along with BR.Â 
Â 
Just my two cents; apologies if someone else has already thrown this out there. I had no desire to grind through all of the posts.

It's right before the NW comes in and starts fighting. Jojen is explaining to Bran the need to get to the wierwood tree and has the vision of it behind Bran. Then when he talks about his own death he is staring at his hand, where we initially see nothing. But then the camera shifts and is placed behind him and we see his hand aflame.Â

Â 
Agreed. I'm confused. Keep thinking its an 'oversight', but yeah...no..that's impossible. And then I thought she would change it after she changed her identity, but no...still there. Then, I asked a friend of mine what they thought about her wearing the ring and the answer was as simple as it gets: "Because she's still married to Tyrion." Made me think that perhaps she'll think Tyrion dead and take it off then. *Shrugs* At this point, its the only theory I can think of.Â

One thing I can say is, it's known,Â  the book is 9 times out of 10 better than the show. And this is not that one time. The story is lost, they're treading on water.
1066	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-05	Harsh on the Hound. Arya told him she wanted to kill him, then tried to do it. She's lucky to still be alive
1067	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-05	Was I the only one who thought Jojen was a total badass for basically laughing in Karl's face when he told him how he was going to die? Jojen was money in this episode.
1068	valyrian_steel	2014-05-05	So they big spoiler in this ep is we now know why Tywin was on the chamber pot so long that Tyrion got a easy shot at him. Â It seems the Lannister cant shit gold they way the used to.
1069	Rockroi	2014-05-05	- The Saint Tyrion distortion field still affecting Sansa. Â Her defense of him was a bit much.Â 
Â 

Â 
I disagree. Â 
Â 
In the books, Sansa is much younger and is presented far more sheltered. Â She despises Tyrion and never gets to know him very well at all. Â 
Â 
In the show, Sansa is older and with age comes empathy and understanding. Â Show-Sansa is older and she can see how fucked Tyrion was and how he actually did not want this. Â In the books, there is no way for Sansa to know this; she just concentrates on what is being done to her. Â in the book, Sansa's communication with Tyrion is non-existent, so its easy to see how this developed. Â In the show, their relationship is no less difficult, but Sansa's age and relationship with Tyrion gets her to appreciate his difficulty. Â She has had far more contact with him in the show than she ever did in the books Â (IIRC, prior to their marriage, their only conversation in the books is in CoK when Tyrion first arrives in KL). Â And their discussions after their marriage have been somewhat illuminating. Â She does think he is in pain and she can relate. Â 
Â 
I think the show did a good job of making Sansa's understanding of Tyrion better and her appreciation of him and his situation more human. Â 
Â 
Frankly, had Sansa NOT said something in defense of Tyrion I would have found that far more odd. Â
1070	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-05	Was I the only one who thought Jojen was a total badass for basically laughing in Karl's face when he told him how he was going to die? Jojen was money in this episode.


Seriously.Â 
"I sawÂ your death tonight. I saw the snow come down upon you all and bury your bones." FUCK YEAH JOJEN!
1071	T.C	2014-05-05	So it's seem we have Saint Tyrion and Saint Cersei now?
1072	gregorio	2014-05-05	On Jojen's vision - I don't believe Meera was asking Â how Jojen would die. This scene was about Bran's journey, and Meera was essentially asking how that journey would end. I took the fire to mean Bran will face off against Melisandre or the dragons. Or, perhaps, Bran will assist the dragons in burning the white walkers.Â 
Â 
On Cersei - I was bothered by her scenes until it dawned on me she was manipulating the three judges. Some believe she isn't capable of this level of cunning, but this isn't exactly an example of high cunning. Every child knows how to play nice with someone who has the power to give him or her what they want. Based on the confused looks on the faces of all three of her targets, do you really think they bought her game? And what's the end result for her? Tywin and Oberyn end up playing their own game, completely independent of her manipulation. Her transparent scheming will blow up in her face and that's very much in line with the book.Â
1073	Uldra I	2014-05-05	...
Â 
I always love Pod and Brienne's scenes and now that they are together is a joy, but again I think that they are going too far with Pod, I mean he is not that stupid! making him burning the rabbit because he didn't get that he had to skin it was too much, not to mention his riding style. I think that they didn't have to go that far.


Â 
Pod is the basically the only comic relief in the show...Â Â  I love how they've made him so silly.
1074	Gneisenau	2014-05-05	I loled when Arya tried to stab Sandor.
1075	Colonel Green	2014-05-05	Show-Sansa is older and she can see how fucked Tyrion was and how he actually did not want this.Â  In the books, there is no way for Sansa to know this


Presumably because Tyrion did want it in the books.Â  He said as much.
Â 
The show, on the other hand, is uncomfortable with the idea of any accusations of impropriety besmirching Saint Tyrion's character.

It wasn't toned down enough.
1077	Rhaegar Targaryen's Ghost	2014-05-05	Did Bloodraven warg into Ghost? The ravens cawing right before Ghost mauled Rast made me think so.


Â 
I thought of that too, and i'm hoping so.
I also liked the foreshadowing that Jojen will end in fire. The only question now is, is it Dragonfire or Melisandre sacrifice?
1078	Konstatera	2014-05-05	So it's seem we have Saint Tyrion and Saint Cersei now?


Â 
Watch the episode again. She was pretending to be nice, so that they will sentence Tyrion to death. That is not very saint-like. Do don't worry. She is still a psycho!
Â 
With that said. I think what they did in the show was brilliant. Cercei thinks she is outsmarting the judges. But in reality, no once buys it! Hence ... Cercei is not that smart!

Not broke just not as rich as they used to be. Robert needed the Lannisters to take the Throne, and now the Lannisters need the Tyrells to hold the Throne.

I think so.  In the books the Lannisters are wealthy and have loaned a lot to the Crown but seem to have a problem forgiving that debt even though they ARE the crown. A little accounting shenanigans that even the threat of the Iron Bank can't seem to decode

Maybe, maybe not. We've never seen Casterly Rock or its mines.
So the mines very well might be dry, and the Lannister's are coasting off of taxes and investments (like their massive loan to the throne).
If they get payed back with interest, they will be rich again.
However, if they are forced to write off their debts as reparations.... well, their are ****ed, and will take decades to recover.

They don't want to forgive the debt because it would weaken House Lannister as a separate entity.  Kevan thinks near the end of his chapter that it may be necessary to do so anyway.

1090	Traitor's Crastard	2014-05-05	Hello forum.  New poster here.  Maidenhead voyage, may the gods protect me.  This episode felt exceedingly lame to me.  Lame for Sullied and Unsullied alike.  I suppose Lady Lysa wins for most compelling character, but she seems to have graduated from the same Supervillain Finishing School as Littlefinger.  Riverrun surely had a varied curriculum in Lord Hoster's day, and apparently a Fat Camp for teenaged Cat.  The other usually engaging and often layered story lines felt trite and inconsequential this week, and didn't offer any of the historical world-building or effective table-setting that these sort of midseason transitional episodes are typical of.
  Arya misses Syrio, the Hound tells her he died because he lacked armor and a big sword ( side note: Try to analyze the text, Sandor, and not make assumptions based on emotion!  So frustrating!).  Cersei misses her daughter and has commissioned a ship as a birthday present; she tells Oberyn that his House has been listed as the shipping address, please send a confirmation raven back when it arrives.  Locke and Karl, HBO employees only, now their watch is ended and neither with any consequence to the season, unless either or both of Hodor, Bran, or Jon's wounds mortify (which they never do for roster guys). 
  I missed a few interactions in between, none terribly important, but this isn't a recap, only one Bastard's reaction.  The most redeeming part of this episode was that D&D didn't try to slip another scene of uncharted canon in at the conclusion to make up for all the Michelle McLaren-ness; I'm hoping one metaphorical middle finger to book readers will suffice for Season 4.  Let's keep up the extended travelogues, invented small talk between major characters, and drawn-out reveals when actually adhering to the terrific source material.  Now who's playing Nimble Dick?

Either a poker-face or stabbing Marg with a brooch.Â 
Â 
The Lannister's aren't broke on account of their lands/taxes, but given these gold mines seem to have been around for thousands of years, it's no surprise they're drying up. Tywin looked, for him, really tired.Â

Even in the Middle Ages, licking one's fingers was considered bad table manners, and someone as exquisitely drilled in etiquette and courtesy as Sansa would never do it, even while feeling relaxed in front of a family member she believed she could trust. No way.

No, that's absurd.  If the mines had run dry that would be common knowledge, seeing as there would be thousands of unemployed miners, and many more people without work at every stage of the process.  For that matter, Robb's men would have noticed when they took some of those mines during their campaign.

Not every mine in the Westerlands are Lannister mines. And Tywin can right off one unproducing mine as a "reserve," and make sure miners are not jumping from mine to mine. So several mines could close, or their produce greatly lied about. Tywin's father proved their wealth is vulnerable by nearly bankrupting the house during a time of piece.
Â 
I would not be surprised if the Lannister's are bankrupted by series end. Not saying they won't bounce back, they collect taxes from a rich region and control a large city, but "rich as a Lannister." Will become a Rat Cook like message.

If memory serves, Tyrion remarks in Season 1 about the death of "the singer" after the raid on Cat's hostage party on the way to the Eyrie.  Correct me if I'm wrong, please.

Â 
I think the singer character who accompanied Cat and Tyrion to the Vale is the same character who gets his tongue ripped out in 1x10, and I thought that in the show he was named Marillion.
Â 
At any rate, unless it's going to be drastically rewritten, the Vale storyline needs some sort of character to serve as Littlefinger's patsy for Lysa's murder. I expect someone to be introduced to fulfill that purpose (hopefully no rape attempt on Sansa required).
1104	acejack	2014-05-05	Was I the only one who thought Jojen was a total badass for basically laughing in Karl's face when he told him how he was going to die? Jojen was money in this episode.

1106	clawson24	2014-05-05	Actually, it makes me wonder if BR had a hand in freeing Ghost, because the ravens started to caw and suddenly the door is open and Ghost is gone.


Â 
Yeah when the Ravens first appeared en masse around Sam and Gilly last year, I thought for sure we'd be getting our introduction to Coldhands. Since then we've had numerous scenes with pronounced raven sounds out in the woods, sometimes when it's implied that White Walkers around, sometimes when they aren't. Really struggling to figure out what the implied connotation is, though it'd definitely be awesome if it was Bloodraven related.
1107	clawson24	2014-05-05	I guess this episode cements Karl Tanner with the likes of Barristan, Arthur Dayne, Daemon Blackfyre, etc. as far as warriors go.

I believe Marillion was the singer in question who was slain on the way to the Eyrie with Cat's party after joining them at the inn where Tyrion was captured (Season 1).  Obviously, the books had more for Marillion to do.  I do remember the singer at KL at the end of Season 1 who Joffrey gives the choice of losing his fingers or tongue after a song he wrote and performed about the royal family, but I don't think he was Marillion.  I certainly could be wrong, though.  My concern is, without the singer, will the show runners lay yet another murder at Sansa's feet, as they clearly have with Joffrey's (the perception, anyway).

1114	clawson24	2014-05-05	Didn't mind the Jon Arryn reveal at all-- it actually seems almost comparable to Joffrey's line about the dagger, and Tyrion finally realizing it was Joff who tried to have Bran killed way back in season one. That's ancient history now, in television terms.
Â 
While Jon Arryn's killer is a big reveal in the books, it just doesn't seem all that important in the show at this point, and would actually seem pretty absurd if coupled with that intense later scene and played up like a climactic reveal. 'Hey, remember that character you liked who died in season one when he was investigating the death of a character you never actually saw? No? Well, strap in, viewer, because the answer to Sean Beane's murder investigation that you didn't really get (and actually wonder if it was in Lord of the Rings and not Game of Thrones, come to think of it), is the climactic reveal of tonight's episode!!!'


Â 
Hahaha well said.
1115	PhoenixFlame	2014-05-05	Some really out of character moments. It's Cersei's idea for Margery to marry Tommen now?Lysa Arryn trusts her son to not throw a fit and talk about Sansa?


Â 
It's supposed to be OOC--she's manipulating Margaery because she's trying to get in good with Mace (a judge on Tyrion's trial).Â 
Â 
Given Robin's age, it would seem odd if he didn't show a touch more maturity. I didn't get the feel from the books he was mentally handicapped, just a lot of learned helplessness and physical ailments.Â
1116	clawson24	2014-05-05	Also, kind of awesome/scary to imagine Bran's potential once he actually learns to really use his abilities and trains under Bloodraven and the CotF. This is not a new revelation by any means, but actually seeing him effortlessly use Hodor to annihilate someone like that really rams home how powerful and how much influence he could have by the end of the series.
1117	Justin Danford	2014-05-05	Why make all the survivors at Crasters morons?
Can't light a fire in the daytime to burn a corpse in S2 cause Mance's scouts might see....Burns entire homestead at night and stands there watching in S4.

1118	clawson24	2014-05-05	Was I the only one who thought Jojen was a total badass for basically laughing in Karl's face when he told him how he was going to die? Jojen was money in this episode.


Â 
Jojen was easily one of my favorite parts of the episode, tied with Lysa and Sansa. He captures the graveness and the mysteriousness of the character well. Really excited for them to reach the cave now -- the visions of it are very beautiful.
1119	clawson24	2014-05-05	Finally finished tonight's ep. This was a pretty fun episode all the way through, starting with the obvious glee of more Aiden Gillen derp, which I was disappointed to see did not appear past the 20 minute mark but will undoubtedly return in "Mockingbird" .
Â 
Of all of the things that happened though, I actually did enjoy being spoiled this time around. We know now--and I think it's safe to say that this one isn't one that D&D invented, GRRM probably created it--that Jojen dies by fire. I'm pretty convinced that this will mean that Jojen is burned by Mel. We know that Mel sees Bran and BR and presumingly Jojen and Meera as servants of the Great Other and I think it's likely to conclude that if Jojen is to die by fire then he is taken/sacrifices himself and is burned by Mel.
Â 
In the books the last we know so far is that Jojen and Meera are still with Bran, BR and the gang and that he is very weak and depressed by the time they reach the cave. He wants to return to Greywater Watch but also has the greendream about it and realizes that has an unfavorable outcome. Mel has that vision where she sees Bran and co. along with BR.Â 
Â 
Just my two cents; apologies if someone else has already thrown this out there. I had no desire to grind through all of the posts.


Â 
While it's certainly a logical conclusion to draw from what we've seen, are we imagining that the show will deviate from the books in that regard? I'm trying to figure out how or why Jojen would run into Mel unless he got up the strength to make that long a trek and for some reason sought Melisandre out.
1120	Greywolf2375	2014-05-05	Â 
The problem with Lysa's cray being fully on display in this episode is that it will come as a shock to precisely no one when she tries to kill Sansa a few episodes down the road.
Â 


Her being crazy was on full display when we met her, it wasn't even much of a surprise when she completely lost it in her book arc either. Â This way people will have something to tie it to since we haven't seen her or Robin for a while.
1121	igrewupinKL	2014-05-05	Looks like Lysa is giving birth to Petyr instead of sexing him...
1122	Epyon	2014-05-05	My thoughts:
Â 
-Hodor almost said a word that wasn't Hodor!!!!!!! When he de-wargs, he looks at his hands and starts saying "why?" but cuts off mid word... Yes this actually bothered me...Â  The actual reaction to being warged and murdering a dude was well done.
Â 
-I thought it was hilarious how the show pretty blatantly just jumped in and stomped on the hopes and dreams of conspiracy theorists... Syrio is alive, is literally openly mocked by the Hound, and the "Jojen paste" theory just went up in flames.Â  I feel like GRRM took a sadistic pleasure in both of those things happening.
Â 
-I feel like we're going to see some "token book spoiler" in every episode now. Tonight it was Jojen + Meera dieing in a fire.
Â 
-The editing for the Snow/Ghost reunion was... off putting and obvious. Also Ghost's head changes sizes abruptly for the shot where it's an actual dog.
Â 
-I was confused by Cersei's kindness to Margery.... and I was completely oblivious to basically all "cattiness" between the two (which I'm told by my girl had totally happened) #obliviousmalenotunderstandingestrogeninduceddrama
Â 
-Arya + Hound is my favorite show duo of all time. I've loved literally every scene with them both in it.
Â 
-Locke being smart enough to sneak into a camp, then dumb enough to walk directly into hanging pots/track mud footprints into the snow right to the door where the hostages are.
Â 
-Jon Snow apparently kind of sucks at fighting... He's lost literally every single fight against someone who knows what they're doing (except Halfhand, who arguably let him win). Was he this inept in the books?
Â 
-Everything at the Eeryie was brilliant. SR throwing the toy out the door, Lysa being so hilariously crazy (the Septon behind door #1 thing was hilarious to me), Peter trying to not look like he's being tortured.
Â 
-As someone earlier in the thread pointed out, Bran killing the man who maimed Jaime (who in turn maimed Bran) is an interesting touch.
Â 
-The Iron Bank being such a world super power... despite being based on an island that shouldn't even have a functional economy (nothing is grown there, and even the water has to be boiled... so they'd have to import -EVERYTHING-), let alone the assets/financial control it does, is really starting to bother me.
Â 
-One last thing, on Sansa being so kind about Tyrion. They are kind of forced into it, because of the whitewashing on Tyrion's character... You just really wouldn't be able to keep Sansa completely sympathetic on the show by having her badmouth one of the main "heroes" of the show. Show Tyrion would need to be much more ambigious/grey to really pull off any antipathy from Sansa. It's actually kind of an interesting development on it's own, because his upcoming transformation is going to be exceptionally jarring for pure show viewers. My conspiracy theory about this, is that they might be trying to set up Tyrion and Sansa actually embracing their marriage at the endgame of the series (him controlling Casterly Rock, and her potentially controlling The Vale, The Riverlands, Harrenhal, and the North)
1123	igrewupinKL	2014-05-05	I was really surprised to see Locke go, i thought he'd have a bigger role to play in the series...meh it was satisfying to see Hodor be done with him
Â 
Jon + Ghost reunion made me smile
Â 
Jojen's fire vision, my theory is that we will be turned into a wight when he dies and thus set a fire

1125	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-05	Also didn't Jon kill like 20 people before that point, then "lost a fight" (whilst killing his opponent) against a more experienced foe in a situation greatly favouring his opponent when he was also fatigued from killing all those men? Certainly he's come better off than Jaime pre-dehanding (ironically getting a boost in the show post de-handing!)
1126	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-05	There are several things I liked in this episode...I'll probably mention each as it comes to mind...
As a first, I liked they didnt do anything that would over shadow Lysa's big reveal. I mean the possible implications of LF masterminding all of it and effectively starting the war of 5 kings...Its great the way it was showed here...it will allow unsullied to take in LF's true character because I think so far everyone has thought Varys is "evil"...and even if LF was responsible for Purple wedding, well they hated Joffery anyway...but now...it will make them think

He was always just a bit above average in the books. And yeah, Qhorin dominated Jon in the books.
1128	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-05	Jon doesn't have to be an awesome fighter. Though he does fine in the books and I thought fine in this episode.

He was disarmed, and about to be executed until Craster's daughter jumped in and stabbed the guy in the back....
Â 
As for the fights before that... It's fairly well shown that many of the men in the Night's Watch are complete novices at best when it comes to sword fighting.... and even if they weren't the fighting odds are ~7-8men counting Jon, versus 11 former Night's Watch who have all spent the entire month drinking and sleeping with inbred girls... it'd be a stretch to assume that any of those 11 are in any serious fighting shape by that point, and they are taken by surprise(or at least not all awake, dressed, and armed when the battle starts)... Imo the odds where with Jon's group regardless
Â 
Â 
Â 


Jon doesn't have to be an awesome fighter. Though he does fine in the books and I thought fine in this episode.


I agree with this, and I'm not trying to really derail this thread, I just think it's somewhat interesting that he isn't that good of a swordsman, especially when you consider he's one of the people most likely to wield Lightbringer/be AAR (if that ever actually happens in the show/books), and also, as a member of The Night's Watch, someone who is going to be in a place that constantly requires him to rely on his swordplay to survive.

This wasnt a huge thing but I liked that they showed Jon getting his ass kicked by Karl...heres why
First, completely different fighting styles, sword vs daggers...as Karl was mocking him that he was taught by a old knight and to fight honorably while Karl learnt on the streets..
Second, Jons never had real long fights...only trained in NW, where he was already superior to everyone since they never had real training...i mean he started teaching all of them almost as soon as he got to the wall in book 1 (bet against Thorne, Ghost juggling)
Third, its an additional reason for him to train so hard after becoming LC...in books part of his motivation was how Halfhand had to let him win...
Fourth, just like Arya against Hound, he was brought down a notch from his high horse. While he might be better than the recruits at NW, by no means is he a superb fighter, just a boy who believes he's better than he really is
1132	Alboin	2014-05-05	That show's Pod extraordinary sexual abilities are putting Â Brienne of Tarth's romantic life into perspective...
1133	Carl Rhaego	2014-05-05	I am not a book purist. I think the books have their flaws and things need to be cut and changed significantly to make the story watchable as a TV show. The Jon/Bran scenes were one of those changes I liked, which surprised me since most of the time the showrunners changed something significantly it was bad (Qarth, Talisa, Shae). I definitely prefered the craster scenes to Bran crawling through the snow again or Jon holding another speech about the wildlings.
Â 
Dany's scene was okay. I don't like how they made her have a navy big enough to transport her army, makes her not going to Westeros a lot more frustrating for those that desperately want to see it. In the books she has no way to transport her people, that was a big reason for staying. It's hard to go anywhere when you lack the means to go from A to B.
Â 
Loved everything with Lysa/Littlefinger/Sansa. Lysa's actress is perfect and Littlefinger was not as terrible and cartoony as usual.
Â 
I really enjoyed that were was comparatively little of King's Landing, it's way too overexposed on the show and the scenes are always a drag for me. The ten minute dialogues there with nothing happening make the pacing in the show seem really weird. It feels like several weeks have passed in Essos and in the North since the beginning of the season and only a few days in King's Landing. The scenes in other storylines never get the time to breath compared to King's Landing.

Â 
Anyway, good episode. A third episode in a row without Ramsay and his Reek. Jon Snow will never find out who the Locke really was.
1135	Batman	2014-05-05	He was always just a bit above average in the books. And yeah, Qhorin dominated Jon in the books.


Â 
He feels average in the series. Maybe even a bit below, its just most of the watch is well below average.Â

1138	Wsaharan	2014-05-05	God the "extra's" on this show are bad sometimes.Â  Did anyone else see Grenn fighting that guy right after Jon came out of the keep?Â  I mean, the guy literally just held his sword out for 5 seconds so Grenn could hit it back and forth before delivering a kill blow.


Â 
At least it's not as bad as Ser Loras charge at the Battle of Blackwater where he slashes at an extra who falls down theatrically, and it looks as real as the WWE.
1139	KarlVyt	2014-05-05	Dany is so fucking stupid.
So good luck trying to change a society of slaver's overnight.Well Yunkai and Astapor turned out just fine.
OMG I'M NOT PREPARED TO RULE, I HAVE TO WAIT.
Â 
Â 
oh dear there's no way i could have miseed something no....!
Â 
Â 
well...let's see
Dear oldÂ Â illyrio mopatis, the golden company with the Mummer's Dragon, funding from the iron bank of braavos, Prince Doran and the entirety of dorne at her side, Mercenaries that can be bought from the free cities with the wealth of Mereen and the liberated cities, more ships as-well to buy.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Oh dear my dragons are too small.!
Â 
The sheer sight of dragons will make the noble houses swear for her.On a side note Ageon the conqueror Â had small dragons at the beginning and waited for them to grow, but the most important thing that he did was...
Â 
Â 
wait for it...
Â 
Â 
MAKE THE MOST OUT OF EVERY FUCKING OPPORTUNITY THAT CAME BEFORE HIM.
Â 
Â 
He wasn't a perfect ruler, but saw an opportunity and conquered westeros.
My god people who like dany are just as stupid as she is.

1140	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-05	Weren't Aegon's dragons in no way small at all when he invaded? Like, enormous, Balerion was at least 100 years old
1141	Jinjonator	2014-05-05	Weren't Aegon's dragons in no way small at all when he invaded? Like, enormous, Balerion was at least 100 years old


Specifically, Balerion was this big.
Â 
Also, it makes perfect sense that Dany would want to hone her skills as a ruler, and use Meereen and Slaver's Bay as a sort of trial period to learn from, before she goes for the real deal. Sure, it's not the sexiest motive for a character to have, but it's absolutely the logical thing to do.
1142	The Drunkard	2014-05-05	Â

Â 
I think all the fights look pretty bad, even the main character ones.Â 
Â 
Maybe I haven't seen LOTR in long enough, but those battles seemed less fake (well... usually).
1143	NOT A TARG I SWEAR	2014-05-05	Â 
This is something that is really irking me this season.
Like the Hound's not stealing code, Olenna pointing out that their conversations in the garden might be overheard, and Cersei wanting more guards by Tommen's door.
It's just dialogue pointing focus on something that is going to be contradicted. WTF?!


The Hound contradictions could have been put there to show that he's more opportunistic/pragmatic than he is principled. It could also be that the showrunners want us to think the Hound is as much of a hypocrite in many ways as the people he rails against.
Â 
The Marg/Cersei scene could be Marg trying to poke the bear to see if she could get Cersei to elicit an emotion to indicate she doesn't mean what she says. It seemed like Marg was a little confused at first by Cersei's 180, which she was right to be confused by as Cersei was probably either buttering up people with possible influence on the trial or it's part of the Lannister plan to keep the Tyrell's on their side for the financial reasons Tywin mentioned.
1144	KarlVyt	2014-05-05	Weren't Aegon's dragons in no way small at all when he invaded? Like, enormous, Balerion was at least 100 years old


Only Balerion. Vhagar and Meraxes were born much later on Dragonstone and Balerion was already old by then. Â Or maybe I've remembered poorly when they were born.
1145	aussiegirl	2014-05-05	I really enjoyed this episode. Not sure yet if it is my fave of the season so far but pretty close. Took me to the end of the episode to realise that Tyrion didn't even appear.
Â 
Loved:
Â 
Margarey and Cersei chat - Lena Headey is second best actress this year after Maisie.
Twyin and Cersei chat
Tommen is hooked on Margaery. So cute.
Brienne and Pod - heh. Loved that she couldn't get the armour undone.
Jojen - I think this is the first time I've actually liked him.
Jon Snow - gets better every episode. With that sword through the mouth, I think he's going to enjoy assassin Arya.
Hodor - damn. Felt for him when he was looking at the blood on his hand.
Â 
Arya - always the best. Congrats Maisie on that fantastic waterdance. It looked great. Don't worry about the Hound. He wouldn't even be fit to stand anywhere near Syrio.
Â 
Not sure on:
Â 
Arya's list - you know you are my fave but putting my Beric on there. We have to have words.
Bran - I'm really surprised he had no reaction to them threatening Meera. It felt like Isaac fell asleep there.
Â 
Hated:
Â 
The Hound - you are a gigantic, gigantic ass. She was just dancing around, practising with her sword. And you couldn't give her a moment to enjoy herself. And hitting a little girl to the ground is never cool.
Â 
I really don't understand where they are going with the Hound's lessons. Because none of them actually are lessons. They are just 'asshole' moments. The whole 'lesson' in the third episode didn't mean anything because its not the small folk that are beheading the Starks. It's the nobles and Arya doesn't trust them as far as she can throw them.
Â 
The 'lesson' tonight was also pointless. Making fun of people you don't know and basically enjoying the fact that a little girl has lost everyone important in her life is only a lesson that the Hound is a gigantic ass. And I'm pretty sure that Arya already knows that one.
Â 
Arya also has not indicated in anyway how she plans on killing those on her list. She held back with Polliver's gang until she could take someone on. And also, Ass, she survived way before you came along.
Â 
Seeing as they are going differently in the books, I want Arya to spend the rest of this season slowly poisoning the Hound. Now, that would be awesome.
1146	Daemon I Blackfyre	2014-05-05	For me this episode was all about Jojen Reed bein a motherfuckin badass.
Thomas Sangster really knows how to deliver a line. Also, the Jon vs Karl fight was really a treat for the eyes.
1147	BasTyra	2014-05-05	Â 



Lysa was really putting the emphasis on Sansa having lost her virginity. She also explicitely mentioned of whether her and Petyr.....foreshadowing or just crazy lysa?

Â 


Â 
I always thought grrm made a big deal out of Sansa's virginity in the books. He makes mention of Margaery loving riding, then at some point in the books Cersei thinks on how there is no way to prove Margaery is not a virgin because she loves riding so much. On the other hand we hear about how much Sansa hates riding about a thousand times in the books. I thought it was interesting that it was pointed out so often. It made me think that something is going to come up in the future regarding Sansa's virginity.Â 
Or maybe he just likes writing about how much people like and hate riding horses. lol.
1148	falcotron	2014-05-05	The IB is a super world power in te books too...
And plenty of places have had a strong economy based on something other than resources. Trade, for example given that it's a port. Skills. And, in fact, clever banking

It might have been a bit more better for GRRM to model Braavos after Medieval Venice more than Dutch-Golden-Age Amsterdam, considering how medieval the world is in general, and how Valyria was much more Roman than Hapsburgâ<U+0080>¦ but on the other hand, a city of refugees and religious radicals becoming a world leader by inventing modern trade and banking makes for a better story than a city of long-established natives becoming a world leader by defeating the pirates.
Â 
And other than that quibble, there is nothing too unrealistic about Braavos the IB, and I don't know why people think otherwise.
1149	The Amethyst Empress	2014-05-05	Sooooo...
Dany has 92 ships and still won't move her ass.
The Lannisters are brokeÂ  Â  
Cersei actually wants Margaery to marry Tommen...Last time I checked she was a doe-eyed whore
Lysa is crazy bitch,ok that was expected,little Robin knows that Alayne is Sansa.
Bran and Jon didn't meet- thank the Gods
Jojen is supposed to die by burning?Or is he going to turn into a wight and then they will burn him?
Â 
edit: The sand snakes are mentioned,that's good

1150	Toed	2014-05-05	"We do not hurt little girls in Dorne" *Darkstar by Crosby, Stills & Nash plays in the background* 
Anyways, loved the episode. 
The change from Alayne being a daughter to a niece was nice, since Sansa looks absolutely nothing like Baelish and it ties in with his "best lies have a grain of truth" thing. Sansa would technically be his niece by marriage... surprised people didnt catch that. 
The reunion with Ghost was touching, but we really aren't seeing any indications of anyone but Bran being a warg. The Night Wolf, the Kindly Man and the cat, Jon's interactions with Wildlings and other wargs, "keep your wolf close beside you"... They're all pretty important to their stories. Maybe we'll see more of that explored later though.

Yeah, her maidenhead will likely be a plot point...probably next book
1152	falcotron	2014-05-05	I really don't understand where they are going with the Hound's lessons. Because none of them actually are lessons. They are just 'asshole' moments.


In the book, Arya's whole story is finding different people that she thinks she can learn from and emulate, only to realize that she doesn't want to be them at all. The BWB, the Hound, and presumably the Kindly Man next.
Â 
The show can't do that with Arya's thoughts, but it's getting the same idea across through action. The BWB appeared to be the most noble organization in the world, but they turned Gendry over to Melisandre, and now Beric and Thoros are on her list. The Hound's code sounded like a way to be honorable without being bound to society's ridiculous rules, but then he robbed a farmer with the flimsiest of justification, and now he's on her list.
1153	Tyranno	2014-05-05	I'm not sure how I feel about this episode.Â 
Â 
Locke was being built up as a great fighter, but only killed 2 men, who were just wildly swinging at him. That's a shame IMO. Locke was a great character and I would have loved to see more of him.Â 
Also, the whole Locke at the Wall and Bran and the Keep stories led to nothing at all. Locke is now dead, so are the mutineers. Nothing happened to Bran and his companions.Â 
So basically everything is as it was before the whole thing? What's the point of Locke being there? What was the point of Bran and the mutineers.Â 
Â 
Episode has some great scenes as well. Cersei was great this episode. Love how she's trying to get everyone's sympathy.Â

Â 
 Â  Except that the Hound was on her list ever since Mycah.Â 
Â 
Also, they really need to burn time with Ayra before she gets on the ship. Â Her AFFC/ADWD material is thin. I don't mind her being paired with Sandor for that...they play well off of each other.
1155	Cersei the Great	2014-05-05	But why why why are they making Cersei sympathetic seriously she is the original Ice Queen; she is suggesting Margery marry Tommen and is agreeing to still to marry Loras? and now the Lannister's gold is dry?
Â 
Why make the entire set up of Locke for him to simply die? Honestly I wanted a better death for him and the whole thing with Hodor that was something Bran guarded he didn't even want to share that with Â anyone .


I agree. Â It was completely out of even 'show' Cersei's character. Â I don't get it. Â I was just really sad for Hodor and the scene with Bran having to make a choice.
1156	falcotron	2014-05-05	The reunion with Ghost was touching, but we really aren't seeing any indications of anyone but Bran being a warg. The Night Wolf, the Kindly Man and the cat, Jon's interactions with Wildlings and other wargs, "keep your wolf close beside you"... They're all pretty important to their stories. Maybe we'll see more of that explored later though.


Did you forget Orell, who traveled with Tormund and Jon, spied on the Wall with his eagle, and warged into his eagle when he died? Or the Thenn warg, who found Tormund's party through his owl? There's been a lot of conversation about warging whenever wildlings are on screen, and if anything the show seems to imply that it's more common than in the books.
Â 
The only thing we haven't seen is the hints (and, later, direct confirmation) that the other Stark kids are also wargs. And of course we haven't seen the Kindly Man, Bloodraven, etc. at all yet, so it's no surprise that we haven't seen that they're wargs.
1157	-Ghost-	2014-05-05	How does Jorah know that Joff is dead all the way in Essos, but Sandor and Arya still dont know and theyre in the Riverlands?
1158	falcotron	2014-05-05	Â

Â 
Also, they really need to burn time with Ayra before she gets on the ship. Â Her AFFC/ADWD material is thin. I don't mind her being paired with Sandor for that...they play well off of each other.


Â 
Didn't we hear her list without him the last time, and now he's on the list again? I'll have to go back and rewatchâ<U+0080>¦ I know we don't always hear the complete list.
Â 
Anyway, you're definitely right that, on top of the Arya character development, they play well off each other; their scenes are usually among the most fun in each episode.
Â 
Meanwhile, I don't think her AFFC/ADwD stuff is thin, except the early part before she gets to the House of Black and White. And they can skip over most of itâ<U+0080><U+0094>end one season with her booking passage with the coin, start the next with her being snuck into Braavos and finding the House. The only problem is that much of her storyâ<U+0080><U+0094>Nymeria, Dareon and Sam, â<U+0080><U+0094>might not fit into the TV show, so they might have to expand on the rest.

I mean more the sword work from the actors rather than the scale of the battles.

Arya and the Hound are wandering around alone, she's thought to be dead, and they rarely run into smallfolk, so who would tell them that? They essentially have no contact with anyone.

The fights scenes have never really been a strength of this series. Other than Blackwater, I can count only one really memorable and exceptionally well executed fight scene in 3 and 1/2 seasons (The Hounds vs Beric). Other than that, they range from mediocre, to clunky, to down right awful. The Battle at Craster's Keep is definitely in the latter camp for me. It was if the Director simply yelled out "Sword Fight" and off the actors and extra's went. The result: A poorly paced silly sequence with guys wildly swinging their pretend swords.
Â 
The thing is, it is possible to put together compelling action sequences on television. It's shame Cinemax's Banshee seems to be able to do better at this each week on 1/8 of the budget of GOT.

I mostly agree, but I really rated the sword fight between Ned Stark and Jaime in the first season, it was really well choreographed even though it was brief, but thats the sort of thing they seem to be cutting corners on now.Â
1172	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-05	I assume both NCW and definitely Sean Bean actually have done some sword work in one of their films. Wasn't NCW in Kingdom of Heaven?

He's been in a few action roles. Sean Bean is an actual motherfucking beast. Got shanked in a bar and didn't give a shit.Â
1174	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-05	Makes sense that their fight would be good, if utterly unnecessary, then

Â 
Being nice to manipulate Marg is one thing, but Cersei played her trump card (marriage to Tommen) with Marg too quickly.Â  Talking marriage would have made more sense after she learned that the mines were no longer producing gold.Â 
Â 
In any case, I would have had her be "nice and sympathetic" to Marg but hint the marriage part to Mace.Â  After all, he's the judge, and she would want to be sure he got the message.Â 
Â 
Also, talking to Marg about the marriage at all is very uncharacteristic because we know Cersei didn't like Marg's influence over Joff (e.g., the disposition of the leftovers) and didn't seem to acknowledge the value of what Marg taught him.Â  Discussing the topic with her suggests that she believes Marg to be her peer (or close to it) which Cersei would never admit.Â  Maybe Show Cersei is more pragmatic than Book Cersei in accepting the value of Marg, but then they shouldn't have made her order Pycelle to serve the leftover food to the dogs in Episode 2.Â

I am not overly impressed by some of the fight scenes either. There is something missing in them, that you can see in shows like Vikings or ROme. The killing is not as brutal. I have gotten over people not using shields or helmets though.

Being nice to manipulate Marg is one thing, but Cersei played her trump card (marriage to Tommen) with Marg too quickly.Â  Talking marriage would have made more sense after she learned that the mines were no longer producing gold.Â 
Â 
In any case, I would have had her be "nice and sympathetic" to Marg but hint the marriage part to Mace.Â  After all, he's the judge, and she would want to be sure he got the message.Â 
Â 
Also, talking to Marg about the marriage at all is very uncharacteristic because we know Cersei didn't like Marg's influence over Joff (e.g., the disposition of the leftovers) and didn't seem to acknowledge the value of what Marg taught him.Â  Discussing the topic with her suggests that she believes Marg to be her peer (or close to it) which Cersei would never admit.Â  Maybe Show Cersei is more pragmatic than Book Cersei in accepting the value of Marg, but then they shouldn't have made her order Pycelle to serve the leftover food to the dogs in Episode 2.Â 


I agree. Her whole character in the show is ranging from mom of the year to evil schemer to victim to victim, to super victim, to still a semi-evil schemer, to victim schemer to...woman who enjoys wine and one facial expression.Â 
Â 
My issue is that Cersei never once in her head ever disparaged of Joffrey, the closest she came was saying he was "a bit wild and strong willed." Those were her actual feelings coming from her mind, she thought he was great...not as great as her, but who can be right? She's now shit talked Joffrey and called him a monster to 1. Tyrion (WTF?), 2. Tywin (WTF?), 3. Jaime (He tells her he was a problem), 4. Marge (WTGFHSGKHFJS?), 5. Sansa (One of the closest she came to saying he was a problem, but was telling her to suck it up and be a better betrothed to him). I honestly didn't mind her scenes with Oberyn and Tywin, they were well done, was hoping they would have one with Mace too, but with Marge, it was stupid...also they're bankrupt...great, now she will have a reason not to pay back the bank other than being overzealous in her own ideas of her greatness and power.Â

I assume both NCW and definitely Sean Bean actually have done some sword work in one of their films. Wasn't NCW in Kingdom of Heaven?


Yeah but he was one of the characters who really suffer from the cuts made for the theatrical version - in that he's just some random who attacks them for the sake of a fight scene in the Director's cut he's Orlando Bloom's cousin and his hunting them down because they killed his brother (Martin Sheen)Â

1180	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-05	sorry if this has already been talked about (havent been able to keep up with the whole post)
Â 
i absolutely loved Tywin and Cersei scene...Tywin testing Cersei's ability to comprehend the situation, trying to determine if she can put aside her feelings for the "good of the family"...i recall as scene in (might be from the show rather than the books) where Cersei is talking to Tywin about her woe's that he should realize that she's the one who deserves his trust and respect rather than Jaime or Tyrion...and he tells her that he does not mistrust her because shes a woman, but rather because she's not "half as clever" as she thinks she is...i believe this was their first one-on-one scene since that moment...
Â 
so it was amazing to see him sort of giving her a chance, grilling her about the importance of the alliance with the Tyrells, explaining the lack of their funding, testing to see her reactions, absolutely wonderfully played by Charles Dance!Â 
Â 
his description of the Iron Banks was definitely off books but I feel it was necessary and again brings things very much in to light, both for us and the Unsullied...i mean it wasn't an unreasonable question right, if the Tyrells are so ambitious and open social climbers, why is "big daddy Tywin" still so adamant for a union, specially after the situation with the Rains of CastamereÂ  
Â 
well this explains it, they are the only family to match them in resources and he's being practical in solidifying the union to get out of debt with the Iron Banks...
Â 
i was also interested to see his expression while Cersei tried to play him about Tyrions trial...i will watch it again, but im hopeful he's smart enough to not be swayed by Cersei's pathetic attempt...i mean he never gave a shit about Joffery anyway and seems genuinely happier to have Tommen as his puppet...but then again, his obviously loathing for Tyrion might just cause him agree with Cersei...
1181	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-05-05	My biggest question is: why was Jojen's hand on fire?mierra asked him how do they know when it will end and he saw fire in his hand.  Probably meaning it will end in fire.

Man Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut is an entirely different movie, it's insane how it changed.Â
1183	rmholt	2014-05-05	Did anyone notice the Meereen navy had 93 ships? IIRC that's the count of Victarion's initial fleet. Definitely an intriguing add-in. G-d only knows where that's going.  
Arya added people who sold one of her best friends to a crazy stranger.
My favorite part was going back and reading Locke theories.
1184	RumHam	2014-05-05	I don't recall Tommen being coronated by the High Septon in the books?

There was a whole thing where the High Septon wouldn't give his blessing until he met with Cersei about the crowns debt and the plight of the church. Â He was crowned by someone else, offscreen. Â
1185	Grizzly Mormont	2014-05-05	it was a pretty crappy gift. i would have thrown it out a window too. a good fake bird would really fly.Â
1186	BlackTalon	2014-05-05	I found that Margaery-and-Cersei scene pretty weird. "I don't even know what to call you, sister or mother"??? Has she already forgotten that little talk between her and Cersei at Tyrion's wedding, where Cersei told Margaery that she would have her strangled in her sleep if she called her "sister" again?
Â 
It didn't seem like taunting or a challenge on Margaery's part at all (and it wouldn't have been like her character either). I think the writers had totally forgotten that previous scene and messed up here.

Â 
this seems to be common feeling...Cersie's attempts to sway the judges to her favor was appreciated with Tywin and Oberyn but made no sense with Margery. from a book perspective, i completely agree.
Â 
from a show perspective, they have showed Mace Tyrell what 3 scenes so far? always showed him as being extremely insignificant and sort of clownish...remembering the scene where Olenna and Tywin were walking during the Purple wedding and she sort of shoo's him away like "oh the grown ups are talking, get back in your corner" Character has no depth or personality...first of all, showing that Cersei is manipulating him by giving him what he wants would not make sense since we have no idea what he wants...if she had tried with Olenna, probably would have had her ass handed to her like last time...and margery is the only other Tyrell who's had the most screen time...
Â 
while watching it, i wasn't happy either....but what i did enjoy at the end of it all was that,
- Margery was still suspicious and most likely not swayed by her sudden attempts to bond
- Tywin was likely not swayed because he's smarter than that (that is what I'm hoping for at least)
- Oberyn seemed surprised but possibly swayed as well
Â 
now Cersei being Cersei thinks she's the smartest of them all and that all her scheming is going to pay off wonderfully. we obviously know what Oberyn is going to doÂ  Â ....I see this as a build up for next season as the beginning of her blundering attempts at scheming and topping everyone...I always loved that part the most in the books about how she always comes up with these "amazing" schemes and how it usually backfires and leaves her fuked!Â 
Â 
so by avoiding my discomfort at the specifics, i'm still pretty excited about where this is heading!Â 
Â 
Also, I was super happy at Oberyn mentioning his 8 daughters, just wish they slipped "Sand Snakes" in to that somehow but there's still possibility for that next 3 eps Â
1190	MyLittleFinger	2014-05-05	Good point, this change could actually be a bit problematic. I assume they'll work a way to get te faith militant in though


They can probably just have that High Septon do something to anger Cersei so she has him killed and then invent a kind of tradition that every new High Septon needs to acknowledge the king and he doesn't causing the tension and such.Â

Stealth insults, but both Marge and Cersei knows what's going on and Marge was literally told by Olenna last episode that the Lannisters need them

Â 
i felt Margery was extremely suspicious of Cersei's sudden attempts at bonding...so to test her new resolve, she throws the sister comment back at her face to see if Cersei is genuine or faking it...if you notice, Margery seemed to be trying to read Cersei's face when she said that..
Â 
going by Cersei's pulling a stannis (jaw-clench) and margery's smile at the end, im guessing margery figured it out that she was being played...but will watch that scene again tonight to check!Â

True. Also I suppose Lady Dustin didn't paint him in the best light.
1200	RavenKing23	2014-05-05	I really enjoyed this episode. Not sure yet if it is my fave of the season so far but pretty close. Took me to the end of the episode to realise that Tyrion didn't even appear.
Â 
Loved:
Â 
Margarey and Cersei chat - Lena Headey is second best actress this year after Maisie.
Twyin and Cersei chat
Tommen is hooked on Margaery. So cute.
Brienne and Pod - heh. Loved that she couldn't get the armour undone.
Jojen - I think this is the first time I've actually liked him.
Jon Snow - gets better every episode. With that sword through the mouth, I think he's going to enjoy assassin Arya.
Hodor - damn. Felt for him when he was looking at the blood on his hand.
Â 
Arya - always the best. Congrats Maisie on that fantastic waterdance. It looked great. Don't worry about the Hound. He wouldn't even be fit to stand anywhere near Syrio.
Â 
Not sure on:
Â 
Arya's list - you know you are my fave but putting my Beric on there. We have to have words.
Bran - I'm really surprised he had no reaction to them threatening Meera. It felt like Isaac fell asleep there.
Â 
Hated:
Â 
The Hound - you are a gigantic, gigantic ass. She was just dancing around, practising with her sword. And you couldn't give her a moment to enjoy herself. And hitting a little girl to the ground is never cool.
Â 
I really don't understand where they are going with the Hound's lessons. Because none of them actually are lessons. They are just 'asshole' moments. The whole 'lesson' in the third episode didn't mean anything because its not the small folk that are beheading the Starks. It's the nobles and Arya doesn't trust them as far as she can throw them.
Â 
The 'lesson' tonight was also pointless. Making fun of people you don't know and basically enjoying the fact that a little girl has lost everyone important in her life is only a lesson that the Hound is a gigantic ass. And I'm pretty sure that Arya already knows that one.
Â 
Arya also has not indicated in anyway how she plans on killing those on her list. She held back with Polliver's gang until she could take someone on. And also, Ass, she survived way before you came along.
Â 
Seeing as they are going differently in the books, I want Arya to spend the rest of this season slowly poisoning the Hound. Now, that would be awesome.
Arya want to be fullu involved in the buisness of vengence and killing. She needs to learn what she can and can't do (kinda like her fans) and there is no way she can kill battle harden men in combat. The slap was a wake up call, she won't get another one
1201	MyLittleFinger	2014-05-05	Â 
True. Also I suppose Lady Dustin didn't paint him in the best light.


The true light.
1202	Chebyshov	2014-05-05	The true light.


Â 
Oh agreed. Brandon seems like a giant bro to me. My point was I'm not sure anyone used "cruel" to describe him before, Â but Lysa is batshit and others didn't exactly think highly of him.

Actually they're still on the second High Septon, the one who Tyrion appointed in the books after the first one got eaten, not the one who imprisons Cersei. Â All the have to do is have Cersei get all paranoid and have the High Septon smothered, just like in the books. Â Then the next on can be the High Sparrow.
Â 
Edit: Tyion didn't actually appoint him, I misspoke as they are (at least officially) elected from within their order. Â Still Cersei considers him "of Tyrion's making" for whatever reason.

1205	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-05	When we look at possible new characters for season 5, it's insane:
3x Martells, maybe Arys, maybe Areo, some sand snakes, maybe Darkstar plus back up cast in Doene and Myrcella back, maybe 3x Greyjoy bros plus stooges, maybe new cast at KL like Rosby etc plus Kevin back, Manderly and maybe other Northerners, maybe Marsh, Quentyn's companions, sellswords, Volantis minor cast, Oldtown minor cast, Moqorro, Riverlands minor cast, House of black and white and Braavos cast...

Â 
Rewatching Tommen's scene in Ep. 4 I'm starting to wonder if his piety is going to be A Thing in the show.Â  Since he's older his naivete can't merely be a function of being too young to understand what's going on, but between "Holiness" being his first answer to Tywin, and his initial answer to Margaery's question of 'do you know what [us being married] means?' isn't anything sexual but an eager reply of "saying our vows in front of the high septon, and..."
Â 
I'm thinking it's possible show Tommen will up being genuinely pious, almost a Baelor-The-Blessed-Lite, to the point that he's unworldly/naive because he's so focused on the divine.Â  He'd be a good candidate for infodumping on the faith, and maybe even pressing the issue of a new High Septon (after Cersei kills this one) or rearming the faith to absolve the debt/give us a bigger army to deal with impending foreign threats might even be partially his idea [or at least, he'll think it's his idea, anyway.Â  He'll really like the idea.]
1208	Greywolf2375	2014-05-05	im guessing lysa would despise sansa even more if he said Â she was his bastard, thus further supporting some speculation that she thinks sansa is actually pety's bastard with catelyn. considering how little d&d regards the intelligence of show viers with their conspicous writing, saying she was his daughter may create some conflict and confusion


Â I think Lysa's distaste for Sansa is already at 100% regardless of the story Petyr put together.Â 
Â 


Harsh on the Hound. Arya told him she wanted to kill him, then tried to do it. She's lucky to still be alive


Â Not really...Sandor knows a whole lot more about armor than Arya does, he knew pretty well she doesn't have the strength to shove that sword through his armor.Â  If he had been wearing chain, maybe different conversation.
Â 


It wasn't toned down enough.


Â It's interesting seeing the discourse over the years of "too much sex v. too much violence".Â  This is one of the few times that they have reallyÂ pushed the edge or gone over with overt violence.Â 
Â 


Â 
Watch the episode again. She was pretending to be nice, so that they will sentence Tyrion to death. That is not very saint-like. Do don't worry. She is still a psycho!
Â 
With that said. I think what they did in the show was brilliant. Cercei thinks she is outsmarting the judges. But in reality, no once buys it! Hence ... Cercei is not that smart!


Â Yeah, I'm not seeing how anyone is calling what Cersei was doing "subtle".Â  Either from the viewership perspective or the people she was talking to - Marg, to what I saw, sees right through it and throws the "sister" line back at her because she knows Cersei is trying to be buddy buddy.
1209	Schokolade!	2014-05-05	I'm not sure how I feel about this episode.Â 
Â 
Locke was being built up as a great fighter, but only killed 2 men, who were just wildly swinging at him. That's a shame IMO. Locke was a great character and I would have loved to see more of him.Â 
Also, the whole Locke at the Wall and Bran and the Keep stories led to nothing at all. Locke is now dead, so are the mutineers. Nothing happened to Bran and his companions.Â 
So basically everything is as it was before the whole thing? What's the point of Locke being there? What was the point of Bran and the mutineers.Â 
Â 
Episode has some great scenes as well. Cersei was great this episode. Love how she's trying to get everyone's sympathy.Â 

I don't think it's that simple. I mean while it's true Bran and Co. Are in the same place geographicly as before they were taken hostage their not in the same emotional place at all. The whole scene was done for character's development.
In the previous seasons We've never seen Bran and Jojen stood up for themselves and the ones they love. 
Osha basically called Jojen a wuss because he was always getting protected by his sister and he never hunted nor did he do any chores, his sister always did everything for him. 
Bran untile now has always submitted to everything that has hapened to him whithout much of a fight ( loosing his legs, Winterfell getting taken by Theon, The maester dieing, going north and I'm sure I'm missing some) Bran is a character that isn't driven by what he wants but by what he has to do ( half of his lines in season 3 start with "I have to" ) He's pretty submissive. 
At the keep, for the first time, it was Bran and Jojen that saved the day, by manning up! They've also discovered a very darker side of themselves. Seriously how creepy/badass was Jojen? And Bran just did one of the most morally ambiguous thing that has ever been done in the show, he killed a man while using an other and ripping him of his personal choice. The horror in Hodors eyes and his inability to immediately follow Bran's order is a good translation of how wrong his action just was and yet there is no question that he did it for the greater good.
1210	Stobb Rark	2014-05-05	mierra asked him how do they know when it will end and he saw fire in his hand. Probably meaning it will end in fire.


I thought that instantly.
Â 
It has nothing to do with R'hollor (unless he's burned by Melisandre - but I can't see that at all), being a Targaryen etc. imo, obvs.

Â I think D&D decided to take it in steps...i've always felt that they have been seriously under-playing the religions in the show (till R'hllor obviously)..i mean i can barely recall a single thing about the High Septon till the Red wedding...even during Ned's beheading, they used Pycelle instead...with all the religions in the ASoIaF, its possible D&D were worried show might be misunderstood as religious show...
Â 
s 1 - some witchcraft and dragons (step 1 to accepting the supernatural)
s 2 - melisandre and R'hollor which high focus on Mel rather than Red god, plus ending sort of proved false (Blackwater)...did you notice how they skated over House of Undying and Qauithe scenes?Â 
s 3 - demon baby which could possibly be witchcraft (which ppl already accept from s1) and Jaqen Hagar (but high focus on him rather Him of Many faces)
s4 - serious R'hollor (Mel burning leeches) and Heart trees (though focus on Brans power more than power of Gods of the North)
Â 
they trying to ease people in to believing the religions (almost nothing about the "silent sisters" so far)...its seems to be a gradual set up, im liking it to be honest...when i think of it from Unsullied POV, its really a lot to take in, its probably smart not to add the religious aspect in to it as well...plus they dont want to lose that demographic who would not watch religiously geared shows
1213	RumHam	2014-05-05	This has probably been mentioned, but it's 43 pages so forgive me.

speaking of that...do you think they will bring back Xaro Xohan Doxos (horrible spelling)? How do u think they will handle that part since they've already changed that story line so drastically?
Â 
Perhaps a different thread to discuss this?

- Meera's almost-rape: "Wait, there's a female character we haven't sexualized or threatened with rape? Â I guess we'd better fix that."
Â 
Â 


Â 
Almost-rape is now outrage worthy? Holster your rape whistle please before you hurt yourself.

agreed...what was it Cersei said..."they hurt little girls everywhere"...i believe it was followed by or preceeding Arya/Hound scene so people would start on Hounds slapping Arya as GOT promoting child abuse...
Â 
not trying to be offensive or rude, but honestly peopel, if stuff like this affects you, should perhaps avoid HBO...i have friends who cannot stand the sight of blood, i doubt they will ever watch True Blood, GOT etc...if they do, knowing full well what they could possibly see, they kind of dont have the right to complain about throwing up or passing out or being traumatized after watching a scene...
Â 
what would you say to a person who climbs off a roller-coaster and says "that was waaay too scary! people shouldn't design rides like these!"Â
1218	Alia Atreides	2014-05-05	Â 
Being nice to manipulate Marg is one thing, but Cersei played her trump card (marriage to Tommen) with Marg too quickly.Â  Talking marriage would have made more sense after she learned that the mines were no longer producing gold.Â 
Â 
In any case, I would have had her be "nice and sympathetic" to Marg but hint the marriage part to Mace.Â  After all, he's the judge, and she would want to be sure he got the message.Â 
Â 
Also, talking to Marg about the marriage at all is very uncharacteristic because we know Cersei didn't like Marg's influence over Joff (e.g., the disposition of the leftovers) and didn't seem to acknowledge the value of what Marg taught him.Â  Discussing the topic with her suggests that she believes Marg to be her peer (or close to it) which Cersei would never admit.Â  Maybe Show Cersei is more pragmatic than Book Cersei in accepting the value of Marg, but then they shouldn't have made her order Pycelle to serve the leftover food to the dogs in Episode 2.Â 


Â 
Â 
I agree, I am also since reading a lot of different viewer's comments here that Cersei wasn't being "nice" for nicety sake; etc. But I will still stick by my own view that Pragmatism, Cunning, and Forethought Â were never her strong suits EVER. She has always let her emotions rule her judgement and to see this play out is strange not fitting with her character not only in the Books but here on the show as well as you just pointed out.
Â 
I will say this Lena Headey is doing a really wonderful job in adding so much complexity to Cersei as she really is much more one-dimensionalÂ in the books, I am interested to when we get to the point of her meltdown.Â
1219	Dany's Silver	2014-05-05	Overall solid episode. Â Jon and NW part was badass. Â Happy I wasn't on the 'Locke is gonna be Bowen Marsh or something' bandwagon.Â I'm happy that Bran booked it before talking to Jon. Â Jojen was right that Jon would impede on their journey.Â Weird thinking that Jon and Bran haven't spoke to each other since the pilot.Â The next episode looks like it has potential to be the best this season.Â So glad the show didn't turn him into Bowen! That was a bright spot in that death scene, which really bothered me because of Hodor's reaction when Bran "releases" him.Â Yeah it reminds me of how it's described in the books where Hodor "curls up and hides" in a corner of his brain when Bran entersExactly. It's like violating the trust of a special needs person, and it really makes me uncomfortable with this aspect of Bran's warging.Â Â but there was a fight scene where bran warged hodor in order to be able to fight. and the show hasn't shown that hodor feels violated by it so i suppose it's not so bad. tbh, i don't know how they would show that since he can only say hodor and we aren't in his mind.Really? I thought Hodor looked at least bewildered by what Bran had made him do, if not completely upset by it. The look on his face when he saw the blood on his hands broke my heart.Â Previews for next week showed Tywin & Company talking about Dany setting up shop as queen.Â  Ser Jorah is still sending reports back to Kings Landing, I take it?Â  Dany will find out around episode 9 or so, and that's when she'll banish him...If he is, then he's a fucking idiot, because he promised Quaithe that he wouldn't betray Dany ever again.Â  I hope we'll see Dany's vision of Quaithe in Meereen!Â  You just know that she's a badass Shadowbinder from Asshai!Â Jon Arryn reveal was underwhelming poorly placed it will make the only cat scene worse.Agreed.Â Â It was also a prosthetic breast, which probably helped.I seem to recall Rory McCann telling a convention that Kate Dickie was walking around on set showing off her prosthetic to everyone, and that she seemed to really enjoy wearing it. Â  Such a fine actress.Â  She does batshit insane so bloody well!Â <snip>And mentioned already in passing, but how about the loafer of the Direwolves, GHOST, finally putting in some work?Â  Welcome back, whitey.Â  As soon as Edd's mutineer head count came up short, and Rast was named as the short head, you just knew what was coming.Â  No kill-stealing here, Ghost finally got to add a deserved notch to his score-sheet.Â Screw Dany, HODOR~! is the true Breaker of Chains.Â  Did not expect Locke to go down this quickly, but it's a good time and a good way to write him out.Â  Dummy made his move on Starksassination too quickly (where's Rickon?) and paid the price.Â  Also liked Hodor staring accusingly (and fearfully) at his hands, reminding us that Regulatin' on Locke is very much not his nature, and laying the groundwork for how This Is Not Okay, even though it was for the greater good this week, Bran is going down an unpleasant path by Warging Into Hodor.<snip>It was very, very good to see Ghost in action (take that, you fucking asshat, Rast!), but I would like to know just how injured Summer is!Â  I can see GRRM also making Bran a darker character in the books, so if this is foreshadowing (since we already know he wargs Hodor in the CotF's cave in order to creep on Meera...) based on what D&D know about GRRM's "broad strokes" for ASoIaF, the okay.Â  If not.... then I don't to see any more violation of sweet Hodor's mind!Â <snip>A Hodor Knows: As super-cool as it was to watch Hodor snap an assholeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s neck at the shoulder (fuck â<U+0080>¦ me ), the scene were Hodor sees blood on his hands spoke volumes.Â  Bran took the free-will of another human being and used it for his own ends; he used Hodor as a means to an ends at the expense of Hodorâ<U+0080><U+0099>s free-will Â and humanity.Â  IT odes not matter how good of an act it was, when Hodor looks down and sees a dead man and blood on his own handsâ<U+0080>¦Â â<U+0080>¦ all I know is Tywin Lannister would have been proud.Â  And the Stark apologists canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t tell me itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not all the same thing.<snip>I can see Bran continuing to a very dark place, which may be exciting... what if Bran is Jon's NissaNissa?Â i don't know if Bran can always warg into Hodor. Â We know from the books that he only did it once (at this point) and it was in absolute desperation to get Hodor to stop screaming, Â I don't think it's something that comes to Bran's mind as one of his abilities.Â Not so. He actually wargs Hodor without Jojen or Meera's knowledge in ADWD, in order to be close to Meera.Â Really... You didn't read into her sauve manipulation of her three victims. Mama Lion's was hugging her victims while sharpening her Axe for the ImpS head.<snip>To be fair my one line comment regarding Cersei's treatment of Margaery was made at the outset of the scene (as in, while watching the show), not at its fruition... It jarred with her previous treatment of Margaery.Â  I expected her to much more forcefully cock-block in that scene.Â
1220	When Harry met Sansa	2014-05-05	People need to relax and calm down with the whole "CERSEI IS SO DIFFERENT WHY IS SHE DIFFERENT AND NICE???". Breathe.
Â 
First and foremost, Cersei doesn't have a POV chapter until AFfC. In ASoS it is only like 200 pages or so of time between Joff and Tywin's deaths IIRC but for dramatic effect D&D altered the timeline and made the Red Wedding happen last season and now are backtracking through material hundreds of pages earlier this season. Which makes total sense as there would be no way the could accomplish the Red Wedding and its leadup, the battle at CB/for the wall and all the rest of the major deaths and other big subplots in one season.
Â 
It's not until after Tywin's death that Cersei becomes ridiculously unstable; we have to remember that the timeline is altered and many of the Jaime scenes we've seen from her this season DID NOT EXIST in the books. There is no doubt in my mind that Cersei will begin her ridiculously unstable, no longer nice routine once Tywin is killed and Jaime leaves again. How could she not? Let's break down how end-of-season Cersei will be.
Â 
-Her dwarf brother that she tried to have executed for murdering her son somehow escaped the capital and is gone to parts unknown after murdering her father.
-Her father, head of the family and in her own words "the most powerful man alive" is no longer alive. She has to start doing shit on her own.
-Her remaining brother and former lover leaves her once again to take command in the Riverlands.
-Sansa Stark is still missing. Her grip on power is loosening by the day and, without her father around, she begins to see the Tyrells as more and more of a looming threat.Â 
Â 
Now, in the context of the show we know that Stannis, Davos and co. will make the decision to sail to the Wall next episode (read the ep. 6 description). It's pretty likely that we don't see much more of KL at all this season aside from the trial, which we know will be held next episode and in episode 8 when Gregor and Oberyn fight. TBH I don't see how Cersei will come into play in Ep. 9 (which, correct me if I'm wrong, will only be set at the wall?) or Ep. 10, where the only time we spend in KL should be in a dungeon and a privy.
Â 
Given all that, I'd fully expect Cersei to start making her irrational decisions as her newfound power floods to her head at the beginning of next season. With her father removed, she is of course under no obligation to marry Loras anymore and he offers to take the white. Cersei sending him to take Dragonstone-- which will probably be revealed as vacant in S5 Ep. 1 or 2 as the realm learns Stannis is at the Wall--could easily be used as the start of the Cersei-Margery fued, which is easily fueled over competing for Tommen's affection and love.
Â 
So in summation, frackin relax with Cersei's even-temperament and total not completely-bitchiness for the moment as it's VERY likely the only times we see her for the rest of the season are in the Tyrion trial scenes. Next year I fully expect we will get book Cersei for good.
1221	basilisk312	2014-05-05	But why why why are they making Cersei sympathetic seriously she is the original Ice Queen; she is suggesting Margery marry Tommen and is agreeing to still to marry Loras? and now the Lannister's gold is dry?~~


it's just an act... don't worry, she's gonna let her true colors out soon (tho maybe not till the hand-killer "escapes")
Â 
Why make the entire set up of Locke for him to simply die? Honestly I wanted a better death for him and the whole thing with Hodor that was something Bran guarded he didn't even want to share that with Â anyoneÂ  .
i think he shared it with jojen... they shared a secretive glance
Â 
~~I loved Ghost killing Rast, Hodor/Bran..~~
Â 

did they burn rast? i don't recall seeing that... ruh roh could be a pudgy WW on the way

1222	El Guapo	2014-05-05	Did anyone notice the Meereen navy had 93 ships? IIRC that's the count of Victarion's initial fleet. Definitely an intriguing add-in. G-d only knows where that's going.
Arya added people who sold one of her best friends to a crazy stranger.
My favorite part was going back and reading Locke theories.


Â 
My guess is that Victarion and the Iron Fleet coming to Dany is going to be cut from the show.

I agree finally to an extent I still don't like  sorry . I love your detailed analysis instead of saying everyone is wrong  Â
1224	tito5601	2014-05-05	didnt expect locke to die to e honest
1225	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-05	Also didn't Jon kill like 20 people before that point, then "lost a fight" (whilst killing his opponent) against a more experienced foe in a situation greatly favouring his opponent when he was also fatigued from killing all those men? Certainly he's come better off than Jaime pre-dehanding (ironically getting a boost in the show post de-handing!)


I refuse to believe Jon is a shitty fighter, especially with a valaryian blade, so I'm going to go with this explanation. I suppose Oberyn did mention "longswords could be a poor choice in closed quarters."Â
1226	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-05	Specifically, Balerion was this big.
Â 
Also, it makes perfect sense that Dany would want to hone her skills as a ruler, and use Meereen and Slaver's Bay as a sort of trial period to learn from, before she goes for the real deal. Sure, it's not the sexiest motive for a character to have, but it's absolutely the logical thing to do.


Holy hell Balerion is big. Great picture. Yea he was 100 years old and Drogon is what? 3? BIG difference.Â

Â 
He did. Â And watching the fight, you can see how the closed quarters were hindering his movements. Â He'd run into something and it would delay his swing. Â It looked very realistic and had less to do with Jon's ability and more to do with the fact that his opponent was faster and better equipped for an inside fight than Jon was- Valyrian steel or not. Â Even in the books, Jon gets bested by Mance with a two-handed broadsword in the training yard. Â He's a very good fighter, but he's not the greatest fighter ever, and neither the books nor the show ever made it out that he was. Â This isn't like LotR where Aragorn could kill 50 people, no matter the conditions.

1228	binhorde	2014-05-05	I'm not convinced we've seen the last of the woman who helped Jon against Karl. I believe her name is Jane McGrath. They really focused the camera on her, multiple times in episode 404. Then she helps Jon, and maybe an argument could even be made saves his life in 405. Then again focused the camera on her, and even had Jon looking at her as Craster's burned. So while the rest of those women, who are not credited, so essentially extras now disappear, maybe the 1 woman who is credited (Jane McGrath) does eventually find her way to Castle Black?
Â 
Is it possible she is a replacement for Val?
1229	Stobb Rark	2014-05-05	So is Asha going to come face to face with Ramsey as hinted in the trailer or not? Stannis is the guy that clubs her and gets hold of her, she doesn't clap eyes on the Bastard in the books - and Stannis looks to be in Braavos while all this is taking place.

That whole thing is new material, so we just don't know.

It looked that way....which would be really odd...Asha fights the Boltons...and then what? Â She has to lose because Ramsay still has Theon until he escapes Winterfell.
Â 
So, would we just have a random failed confrontation where Asha goes there and doesn't get Theon and then? shows up again after Bayon dies...

Â 
I feel like it has to end with Asha seeing what Theon has become and calling it off and fleeing. Â Then we can move forward with the Greyjoy plot and the Ramsey/Winterfell plot. Â I don't remember in the books. Does Asha know Theon is alive or do they assume him did? Also, again, not killing Balon yet mean no Kingmoot. I wonder at this point if they're planning on just waiting to kill him towards the end of the season: Kind of a Stannis ascent ending: Â beating the Wildlings, maybe having the back of the bank and the final "fake" king dying. Â Then next season we're looking at the Greyjoys and Dorne being more prevalent while Kingslanding starts to take a backseat.Â

Â 
Of course, Aragorn has had about 70 more years of fighting experience than Jon has had. Â At Jon's age, I think Aragorn was going on his first Orc-killing foray, with two badass half-Elven foster-brothers to watch over him and teach him. Â And Mance has had what, 20+ more years of experience than Jon...But I'm glad they paid enough attention to physical logistics to show the difficulty with indoor fighting with a longsword.

i was thinking the same thing...i dont recall Syrio's lessons advancing this far...and the fact that she JUST got needle back and been on the run for 2.5 seasons, yet still improved to this level is an excellent character scripting for Arya...i felt awful for her when she actually attempted to stab him and he says "smart men wear armor" (paraphrasing) i wish she'd thought of it that needle wouldn't go through armor...but as Syrio said..."every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better"Â

But, since when did Braavosi Water-Dancing turn in to Chinese Wushu? I thought it was cool to see Arya doing moves inspired by a Contemporary Jian (Straight Sword) routine, but I think turning her into Zhang Ziyi from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon seemed a little bit "out of place". However, if that was truly Maisie doing all of that acrobatics, Bravo!
Â 
Pun very much intended.


Â 
I remember reading somewhere she is a dancer and that was one of her reasons they hired her.
I actually googled her right now and there are a lot of videos on youtube of her dancing performances.

Â 
also, not sure if you know this...Masie is actually right handed, but because Arya is left handed in the books, she's learnt left-handed sword play, so those moves were even cooler when u consider that...you dont see many kids these days so dedicated, very impressive!Â
1244	Stobb Rark	2014-05-05	Â 
That whole thing is new material, so we just don't know. Â If I had to guess she and her men will fight a skirmish, suffer losses (storming a castle with fifty men is a terrible plan.) but escape, and then learn of her father's death and return to the Iron Islands setting up the Kingsmoot for next season.


Â 
Â 


Â 
It looked that way....which would be really odd...Asha fights the Boltons...and then what? Â She has to lose because Ramsay still has Theon until he escapes Winterfell.
Â 
So, would we just have a random failed confrontation where Asha goes there and doesn't get Theon and then? shows up again after Bayon dies...


Â 
Â 


Â 
I feel like it has to end with Asha seeing what Theon has become and calling it off and fleeing. Â Then we can move forward with the Greyjoy plot and the Ramsey/Winterfell plot. Â I don't remember in the books. Does Asha know Theon is alive or do they assume him did? Also, again, not killing Balon yet mean no Kingmoot. I wonder at this point if they're planning on just waiting to kill him towards the end of the season: Kind of a Stannis ascent ending: Â beating the Wildlings, maybe having the back of the bank and the final "fake" king dying. Â Then next season we're looking at the Greyjoys and Dorne being more prevalent while Kingslanding starts to take a backseat.Â 


Â 
Â 
Cheers for the replies.Â 
Â 
Yeah, because the show has gone left-field, we cant really assume too much. It's just guess work. Shouldn't be like that. Seems like in the next few episodes, they need to fit an awful lot in. Stannis arrives at the Wall and defeats the Wildlings and co but - he's in Braavos as Asha is fronting Ramsey but she can't come away with Theon, because
Â 
1) Stannis hasn't arrived
Â 
2) Theon actually escapes on his own
Â 
andÂ 
Â 
3) Balon is still alive.
Â 
Even if Balon dying is the trigger for Asha to go to Theon/Ramsey, it has to go away from the books again because there's so much in between!! Bloody hell.
Â 
Probably agree that Asha sees Theon, is seen off by Ramsey and is then captured later by a money laden Stannis. Head banging stuff.

I adore Isaac, but I mostly find the eyebrows distracting. Â  It makes sense that he wouldn't have had much of a haircut, though.Â  It's not like Tommy is around to trim him (recall Robb saying, "Shear him good, Tommy. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair," to their barber [who is really one of the show's swordmasters!] in the pilot when Jon needs a haircut).

I really hope your right. I'll be pissed if Yara is captured and also if them omit the Kingsmoot. I pretty much want that scene solely for Euron's intro.Â
1248	Knight of Ashes	2014-05-05	I enjoyed the Cersei scenes and the varied interpretations people have of it far more than Jon and co. routing the bad guys out at Craster's. Really, was anybody expecting a different outcome of that? The only surprise was Locke getting killed and I never liked him much anyway.
1249	Haymaker	2014-05-05	Oh, crap, it just occurred to me that with the wedding left out, there was no rape attempt on Sansa from a "Marillion"-like character. That could happen later, though, I guess.
Â 
Aidan Gillen's nauseated "Do Not Want" faces while Lysa was all up in his business were pretty hilarious.


Â 
Speaking of Marillion, wonder if the show will bring that character back to fullfill his roll from the books.Â  Still can make a perfect patsy since he no longer has a toungue and can't speak to defend his innocence (but can't confess either which could be an issue).Â  I predict they don't bother with the attempted rape scenes regardless, as it seems the story line is being rushed a little to fit it in by episode 7.

I won't attempt to defend the show's use of nudity and rape, but I really don't think Martin included incidents of rape in the books because he thought it was entertaining.

Barristan is still sitting on that info and can bust it out as a trump card whenever they remember/want to reintroduce that plot element.Â  They even had Jorah nervously try to feel him out early in Season 3 to see if Barristan knew.Â  But Barristan did not give away that he knew.
Â 
Probably once Dany's attempt at ruling goes south they'll need an excuse, and something will happen that makes it look like there's a mole, and Jorah will get scapegoated.Â  Actually, Jorah was telling her to hold off on Westeros this week, THAT might be enough to look like "oh you have a hidden agenda, trying to keep me away from your paymasters!".Â  We'll see.

Good point.Â Â  They'll probably truncate if not eliminate Tyrion's boat ride with The Griffs.Â  Tyrion arriving in Essos and Jorah getting fired will probably happen early and in consecutive episodes, possibly even the same episode, so they can be free to meet up early on in Season 5 and spend the rest of it as another Buddy Cop Adventure in what is now the show's grand tradition, and depending on how far they plan to advance that story we'll see them get sold into slavery together and/or possibly join up with the mercenaries.Â  Season 4's finale is probably the earliest we can expect Jorah to get exiled.

Yara has already left to go to Theon. Which btw was where she found herself at the end of ADWD.
Balon will die before Stannis goes North (leeches). That could be very soon. Thus endeth perhaps that generation of Iron Island characters. If so I'd like to see a spinoff - the adventures of the Greyjoys - with Theons uncles. Still interested in the 93 ships in Slavers Bay coming from Meereen navy.  Perhaps they mutiny.

Even if they did have a representative in Westeros on the show, they're still at this point trying to collect from the Lannisters/King Tommen. Â They have no reason to go to Stannis yet, so he's going to them. Â It's sorta on the way north to The Wall, and it allows them to kill time while The Wall plotline catches up. Â I mean really it seemed like Stannis was ready to head to The Wall at the end of last season, so they had to delay him somehow.

1284	YellowDogJen	2014-05-05	For gods sake did you miss my line where I said I don't think he is alive?! Another poster was asking why people are taking from that convo that Syrio is alive. I was just explaining other peoples opinions to them. You are barking up the wrong tree. I completely agree Syrio is dead & gone & not coming back...


Â 
That was me! Thanks for your reply. I understood completely that you were saying why other people seemed to interpret the Hound's dialog to mean that Syrio survived - not that you yourself felt that way.
Â 
Sorry you got grief for being nice.
Â 
While I fervently hope Syrio escaped, I doubt it.  I loved his character in the books and Syrio was great on the show as well.
Â 
I sure didn't think the Hound thinks Syrio survived, as he demonstrated to Arya the odds against (as well as stated) that a unarmored man with a stick, even the "greatest swordsman in the world", could beat an armored man with a sword. The only way for Syrio to live is to run, and well...
Â 
I thought the Hound was trying to (1) hurt Arya's feelings by making fun of Syrio and (2) give her a dose of reality medicine as far as fighting is concerned.
Â 
Arya's water dancing was lovely, though. I love Arya.
1285	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2014-05-05	Lots of people in this thread not realising that Cersei is being a properly scheming in this episode, not being nice for the sake of it. It was obvious with Tywin, but apparently when it was being subtle - the Marg scene - some people are mistaking her acting nice to twist the judges' arms for 'whitewashing'.
Â 
Any excuse to whine about the show for some people 
Â 
Jojen, Lysa & Sansa were all so good in this episode. Slight shame that the Jon Arryn reveal wasn't left until Only Cat, but that scene is still destined to be epic.Cersei scheming to get Mace on her side in this way doesn't make much sense. Cersei was worried about Marg with Joff who is much stronger a character than Tommen. So she is willing to make one of her chief rivals queen just to make sure Tyrion is killed? If Tyrion was found innocent would it even be that difficult for Cersei to have Tyrion killed? She is making so many moves to make sure Tyrion is found guilty anyway. Marg and the Tyrells are a much bigger threat to Cersei than Tyrion. So basically the whole scheming is give Marg Tyrell the highest position possible to try and gain favor with one of the three judges? This is the poorest 'scheming' possible. Cersei talks of power plenty yet she is willing to give control of the kingdom to the Tyrells just so she doesn't have to deal with killing a dwarf? Of which she is working many angles on making sure the trial is a landslide against him anyway. You don't think this is a very poorly lopsided trade off? I'll make you queen if you can help me get one third of the judges against my brother.

She is making so many moves to make sure Tyrion is found guilty anyway. Marg and the Tyrells are a much bigger threat to Cersei than Tyrion. So basically the whole scheming is give Marg Tyrell the highest position possible to try and gain favor with one of the three judges? This is the poorest 'scheming' possible. Cersei talks of power plenty yet she is willing to give control of the kingdom to the Tyrells just so she doesn't have to deal with killing a dwarf? Of which she is working many angles on making sure the trial is a landslide against him anyway. You don't think this is a very poorly lopsided trade off? I'll make you queen if you can help me get one third of the judges against my brother.


Â 
There's nothing Cersei can do to stop Marg from marrying Tommen (We already knew it would happen from last episode), so I saw it as her pretending to offer something that was already theirs and pretend to be nice to win favor. Of course once she no longer needs Mace's vote I don't expect Cersei to keep up the act, which you can tell by the look of her needing to throw up every time Marg said something.Â

1287	Ellfoy	2014-05-05	So, i think i never as much laughed watching an episode of GoT. Crasy Lysa is epic. I'm so happy that they kept the same actor for Sweet Robin !
Â 
Sorry, I have to mention this:
When I saw Carl-the-rapist-who-likes-knives-and-curly-hair-just-like-his-mommy bowed before Jon Snow, I laughed thinking "even asreholes bows before Lord Snow"(and "maybe, he likes his hair too"). But then, someone here complained because the Lords didn't kneel before Tommen, they just bowed. Plus, the revelation in this episode that "snow falling in a vision = Jon Snow".The Show seems to insist on "the snow falling on the iron throne vision" Â Well, that got me thinking. The title of this episode is "First of His Name", right ? But, we saw Tommen like what ? 2 minutes ? The coronation of Tommen wasn't the important thing in this episode. Are D&D trying to pass a message ?
1288	Colonel Green	2014-05-05	Are D&D trying to pass a message ?


I doubt it.
1289	Ghost wind	2014-05-05	I will write all first impressions of the episode together as I am watching it after everyone else:
Coronation: how well did it feel to see Cersei almost begging Margaery to wed Tommen?? I think the look when she says "mother" is priceless...Â 
Daenerys' council:Â Did anyone else see how quickly Grey Worm exited the room? It didn't take him more than 3 seconds... Shows how important obedience is to an unsullied! Well done about the two possibilities: staying in SB or going to Westeros and how the opinions of Mormont and Barristan differ. Also I imagine people who haven't read the books will be very very very pissed about Daenerys not going to Westeros.. At least I was when I read it.
Sansa and Littlefinger: it appears no Fingers. Good back up of the Vale never being conquered and all that! ALAYNE! Doesn't Robert (Robin) look a bit like the Weasley Twins? Or was it my imagination? WOWOWOWOWOWOW wait a second..... Did Lysa kill Jon Arryn in the books?? I don't remember that! She certainly did fulfill her promise of screaming didn't she?
Arya and the Hound: the Red Woman, Beric Dondarrion, Thoros of Myr? Arya is more in love with Gendry than I thought. Â Great dialogue by the way. Every piece of it.
Sansa and Lysa: One moment she is your kind aunt Lysa the next she goes crazy bitch and gets the crap out of you and then again kind aunt Lysa consoling you... Really, she has a serious mental illness that one.
Pod and Brienne: how can you ride worse than Pod?? Is it even possible? Loved when he just crossed in front of Brienne.. Her face was like: please release me from this idiot!
Arya and the Hound:Â yet another great dialogue between this two, well nothing out of the normal, theirs always are! Anyway that one hand flip or whatever she did Â was niceeee!
Oberyn and Cersei: sorry Cersei don't think Oberyn will be able to give Myrcella your gifts...Â  Â Anyway well tried... hahahaha
Craster's:Â Jojen's hand burning: does that mean that they will become white walkers and so the will be killed by fire? Or something like that? More foreshadowing about tWoW or not? Well played Locke, well played! Jojen telling Carl he was going to die was so gooood! Almost jumped of joy with "buried by snow". Really did not think Hodor would kill Locke that was a surprise... But anyway: GO ON HODOOOR! Really tough decision Bran had to do... I really like how they are picturing him as a leader. Reaaally HBO?? Through the mouth? Didn't you come up with the idea of something more gruesome? Well that definitely was a Ghost... I jumped when he killed Rast: for real!
1290	rmholt	2014-05-05	Â 
I just checked and he wasn't.Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
It was heavily implied a few episodes back when Davos mentioned the Iron Bank and got that lightbulb over his head facial expression.

Yes of courseand in the books a Braavosi banker does arrive to possibly fund Stannis. That hardly means Stannis himself needs to go even if he initiates the transaction. He has people. Davos would be far more likely in the show to make the trip. He was gone for the Stannis action shortly after arriving at the Wall.  So his eastern tour might make a stop at, or be limited to, Braavos. Stannis is going to have a hard time fighting wildlings, rallying the North, and marching on Winterfell without actually being there. So far easier to bring the banker to him or send someone like Davos.
But would it be tidier to have the Iron Bank come to Westeros as one representative to be turned aside by KL and then go to Stannis?
1291	rmholt	2014-05-05	WOWOWOWOWOWOW wait a second..... Did Lysa kill Jon Arryn in the books??

Yes - and sent the lying letter to Cat
1292	RumHam	2014-05-05	Yes of courseand in the books a Braavosi banker does arrive to possibly fund Stannis. That hardly means Stannis himself needs to go even if he initiates the transaction. He has people. Davos would be far more likely in the show to make the trip. He was gone for the Stannis action shortly after arriving at the Wall.

Â 
Yeah probably, but as I mentioned before he was (or really should be, though he showed know sign of it last time we saw him) heading north by ship anyway, so stopping at Braavos makes some sense. Â Especially if the producers want to establish the city in viewers minds for when Arya heads that way later.
Â 
On another topic, Lysa mentioned that she allowed Pyter to return to Kings Landing to get Sansa. Â I guess that explains why they filmed things at the Vale last season, but does it actually make any sense? Â He must have sailed to the Vale only to immediately go back? Â If Lysa was so eager to marry Pyter why didn't she just do it when he first got there?
1293	Ellfoy	2014-05-05	I doubt it.


Â 
You think I got it wrong in spite of the fact that it would tie well with the King/Jon foreshadowing thing that we got in the books or do you doubt that D&D can be subtle ?
1294	Skeksi	2014-05-05	Really liked this episode overall (more on that in the Positive Nitpicking thread). The only things I had a bit of an issue with were 1) We don't really get a lot of story progression from the material at Craster's Keep. We get a definite resolution to what happened to the brothers there, it closes off the "Craster and his wives storyline" with the wives making their own way, and Jon reunites with Ghost, that's pretty much it. Oh, and Locke dies. Saying that, it does give both Jon and Bran something to do before the end of the season, and I accept that they have to give major characters scenes every so often. It was an enjoyable watch, if largely fillery, and 2) Sandor's line "I bet his hair was greasier than Joffrey's cunt", which, yes, hilarious, let's belittle Joffrey by comparing him to a woman, like he didn't have plenty of negative points going for him all on his own, and which I'm mentally depositing in the basket of "Ill advised and tiresome lines".
Â 
I confess, I thought that the middle of this season was going to be a bit slow with such major events/ deaths in the first and last few episodes coming up, but this was a much better episode than the two that came before it, IMO.
Â 
I also noticed that the show is really doubling down on it's message of fighting fair getting you nowhere. We had Sandor's scene with Arya, pointing out that if a great swordsman goes up against a man with a real sword and armor, he's almost certainly going to lose, and then of course we had Jon vs. Karl "Focking Legend" Tanner hammering it home. With Bronn hitting Jaime around the face with his own hand last episode too, it's certainly a big recurring theme in the show.
1295	NightStark	2014-05-05	Â 
Well yes I was thinking of him playing instruments or something, not returning as a singer.

Yeah that could work, he would obviously be a good person to blame Lysa's murder on too..even more so than the book Marillion.
1296	Ghost wind	2014-05-05	Yes - and sent the lying letter to Cat


Â 
Well then I forgot that bit.. Gotta re-read that
1297	Ghost wind	2014-05-05	Â

Â 
It is a recurring theme in the whole series I'd say. We've got Robb and Ned who are honorable and everything but still get killed in treacherous ways. I think the whole honor vs. winning is the most important idea of the series or at least util CoK. And yes we get more examples in Bronn fighting at the Eyrie, Blackwater Bay and so on. Well pointed out!
1298	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2014-05-05	So Loras Tyrell marrying the Queen Regent and Mace being on the small council isn't enough to secure the Tyrells allegiance. If that isn't enough I doubt Marg becoming queen does much. The biggest upside I guess is at least Marg won't be shopped to strengthen the Tyrells even further.
1299	Grayven	2014-05-05	Was Locke actually going to carry Bran all the way back to the Dreadfort? Â Outside of being a necessary plot device, I can't see a reason for him to decide to Bran-nap. Â Â If killing him out in the snow would have satisfied Bolton's directive, he was already chained up and helpless in the 'dog room'.Â
1300	NightStark	2014-05-05	Was Locke actually going to carry Bran all the way back to the Dreadfort? Â Outside of being a necessary plot device, I can't see a reason for him to decide to Bran-nap. Â 


Â 
They need Rickon too. No point killing Bran if Rickon is still alive to claim Winterfell.
1301	Lord of Winterhell	2014-05-05	Didn't just Jon light the biggest fire the north has ever seen?
1302	Ser Steven	2014-05-05	Â 
for the exactly that point she doesn't know Subtlety if she was shown the definition of it; within the books it is her greatest weakness, I'm sorry I am not going to back down from that gripe; I pretty much support the show and the writers as yes they have read all the books, etc I'm just disappointed in how they are playing it out is all. 


Except Cersei wasn't Subtle. Margery figured it out immediately which is why she said the mother/sister comment at the end, It would piss Cersei off, and she knew Cersei wouldn't say anything because she was trying to butter up the judges daughter. Tywin got everything he asked of Cersei and when she started to ask for something he said shut up and GTFO. Even Oberyn figured it out and ignored what she was asking.
1303	Kikiadiamond	2014-05-05	Bringing Syrio back is not in George's nature, despite the whole business about him not dying on screen. He has a great death, and it would cheapen him as a character to have him miraculously survive the encounter. The fact that he bites it to a lesser swordsman and complete douche is what makes his death tragic, and yet realistic.Â 

Yes, I agree.  The Hound was simply pointing out that skill won't win out against real steel and armour.

Â 
I hope people understood that is what "nice" Cersei was all about - working the judges -- Mace's daughter, Tywin, Oberyn.Â 


Â 
Loud and clear. But so many book readers here were too busy looking for "whitewashing/character assassination" opportunities so they could get their hate on towards the show some more, and clearly missed it.
Â 
I also think Tywin was (mostly) lying to Cersei, because he knows she's working him, so he worked her right back, that way she wouldn't fight him anymore about marrying Loras.
Â 
As far as the biggest OMFG moment of the episode for my unsullied friends who I watch with, was Lysa/LF being behind Jon Arryn's murder. Got to hand it to them, they pay attention.Â 
Â 
Loved that Ghost ate Rast's face off. Loved Jon making Karl literally reverse eat his sword. Loved Bran warging Hodor, and killing Locke (giant cheer from our entire living room.) Loved Pod telling Brienne about how he killed a Kingsguard to save Tyrion at the Blackwater. (Burning bunny! YUM!) Loved Dany's self-awareness discovery. Loved Bran being given a wonderful grownup-decision about how he couldn't have a moment with Jon as much as he wanted to. Loved the Jon/Ghost reunion. Loved Arya and the Hound - every moment. Want the spinoff.
1305	Grayven	2014-05-05	Â 
They need Rickon too. No point killing Bran if Rickon is still alive to claim Winterfell.


Â 
I'd hate to see this guy go to a market. Â "I'm looking for two things.. but if they aren't together, I better drag the entire displays together before marking one off my list."
Â 
I was also curious about whether any of those surviving women might happen to ask what happened to the kids and the 7 foot tall guy who kept saying 'Hodor'. Â That would be a bit of a tell, I think, if Jon heard it a few times.

Did the women even know of them? From what I saw they put them separate?Â
1307	Lady White Wolf	2014-05-05	Didn't just Jon light the biggest fire the north has ever seen?  Lol I totally was thinking the same thing.
1308	rmholt	2014-05-05	Yes, I agree.  The Hound was simply pointing out that skill won't win out against real steel and armour.

I think he was pointing out, though not intentionally, that a) he didn't know squat about fighting without armor or water dancing and  even if water dancing could beat armor, Arya was just a beginner. Yeah of course Syrio couldn't beat the hound any more than a guy with no armor and only a spear could beat a big guy in heavy plate ;/
1309	RumHam	2014-05-05	Didn't just Jon light the biggest fire the north has ever seen?


Â 
The burning of Winterfell should have been way bigger.
1310	Reinzer	2014-05-05	I just wanna give props to the actor that plays Jojen Reed. He plays his role perfectly.
1311	RavenKing23	2014-05-05	I think he was pointing out, though not intentionally, that a) he didn't know squat about fighting without armor or water dancing and  even if water dancing could beat armor, Arya was just a beginner.

Just like the Hound couldn't squash a certain Braavosi head like a plum as a certain Moutain did to a Dornishman.
1312	rmholt	2014-05-05	Just like the Hound couldn't squash a certain Braavosi head like a plum as a certain Moutain did to a Dornishman.

Stupid Oberyn showing off. He had the Mtn killed.
1313	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-05-05	I personally don't mind the Jon Arryn reveal coming this early. I hated that exposition dump in the books prior to the murder attempt: cheesy villain(ess) monologuing, very clumsy writing.Â  This breaks it up a little. It's still clumsy, but it won't break up the tension in the scene where Lysa is trying to kill Sansa with a bunch of expository villainess monologuing explaining in great detail exactly what Lysa's deal is. Likewise for the scene with Sansa in this episode where Lysa shows her crazy, jealous side early on.


Â 
But why did they have to F up Joff trying to kill Bran in episode 2?
1314	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-05	Rewatching the ep now...
Confirmed margery knew she was being played...cersei basically says she'll hook Margery up with Tommen... you can see her giving her crooked smile and checking Cerseis reaction as "sister or mother" comment...
Just noticed Daario's expression when Jorah is talking about Yunkai...hilarious..u can tell he's just thinking "what a buzz kill, jeez, chill out man" 
Dany seems to have stopped calling him Ser Jorah...he's just Jorah to her now...interesting shift
Emilias performance seemed weak...has to be said
How comes all the purists arent yelling about LF saying Sansa is his neice and not bastard daughter?
I was surprised to see them showing Robert is so happy and close with LF. 
LF seems so freaked out by Lysa 
His expression when he sees the septon is hilarious
Lysa auditioning for porn with her screams? 
Tywin "I didnt like your husband...used to pat me on the back a lot" epic charles dance
I loved that Tywin didnt specify the size of the loan...just reiterated "tremendous amount"...he's not a man to exaggerate
He spells it out so neatly for Cersei about the iron banks.."u cant run from them, cant cheat them, cant sway them with excuses... if u owe them money, u dont want to crumble urself..u pay it back" so clear...and cersei still dicks them around..one word...MORON 
Cersei saying "What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?" How does that even make sense? He killed a psychopath who had the Baratheon name...even if people said he was a lannister, he would bring nothing good to their legacy...surely tywin sees through her BS! By his expression, he seems to be trying to make sense of her words too lol
All the additions to Aryas list! How come joffery wasnt on it though? Indicating she knows he's dead???
Masies eyes when she says "the hound"...chills down to my bones
How come all the haters didnt say Lysa talking about Cats sweet tooth wasn't a filler? 
Sansas performance seems to have improved
Wow Lysa is all over the place! Cat, Brandon, brothel, whores, pregnant, marry robin, lady of the vale...very nice
Here's another one for u purists...Brienne/Pod horse ride? Not filler? 
"You'll say I wasnt a very good squire"  Pod's awesome
Wish they played some music while Aryas practicing, would add an impending doom feeling to the scene and aryas future assassinations. When u watch it again, just watch her face..u'll see what I mean..
Hound.."who taught u that shite!?" 
"I bet his hairs greasier than joffereys cunt " lolll the smile on his face
Look at his face "the greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Maryn fukin Trant!"
"The greatest swordsman who ever lived didnt have a sword!" The joy on his face! Never expected to see that look on the Hounds face lol!
Lesson of the day.."ur friends dead and Trant is not because he had on armor...and a big fucking sword" awesome wisdom being passed on here 
Oberyn composing a poem...huh..
He mentions Elia, 5th daughter...I dont remember the parts from Dorne well...is that the one involved with the kingsguard? 
"Everywhere in the world they hurt little girl" just after arya gets backhanded...and foreshadowing Meera
So emotional Cersei...Oberyn be like "waaat...."
Lollll, poor pod...rabbit on fire 
Brienne should do something wirh her hair, shes starting to actually look feminine...
Brienne seemed so impressed that pod killed a kingsguard...I almost thought shes gona climb on her high horse and start yelling at poor kid for stabbing him from behind...guess that kind hate only for Kingslayer? Or maybe they showing shes growing up and not judging everyone so quickly
Wheres Rast taking that woman? Off to rape in snow? Odd...
Damn Locke looks so vicious...like a real wild animal...
How come Locke didnt consider that one of the other prisoners might be Rickon?
Random question...both Bran and Jojen see this huge solitary weirwood tree, under which is BR presumably...in the books, the cave they are in, doesnt Bran mention a whole forest/network of weirwood trees above? I always assumed it was something like in Avatar, network of trees amplifying BR's powers...guess it could be behind the hill Jojen refers to...
When jojen says "this isnt the end...not for u...not yet"...does that mean he's seen Brans death too? Would be interested to see that vision, even if it is a spoiler from the next books..
Jojens hand on fire could have too many implications...I say again D&D pulling a GRRM and just trying to mess with our heads
Can I say I really dislike the Valyrian steel in the show? I've always pictured it exactly like Damascus steel, ICE and Oathkeeper tended too look at that in certain angles....Longclaw just looks like shiny plain steel 
Locke "we'll carve 'em up like walnut pie" his imagination says it all...
Oh lord...just got the most horrific image in my head...Karl, Ramsay and Locke, together and bored...
Why did Bran immediately suspect Locke the moment he asked "ur brandon stark?" Intuition? Psycho vibe? I dont get it...
Love the thunder associated with the moment bran leaves his body and another when he enters Hodor
Ok, that was a seriously poweful scene...
Bran crawling to get closer to Jon...a bit on the nose but he is just a kid I suppose
These 4 seem utterly unconcerned that they will get noticed..again...i'd be running like hell
Ah ha! This is why they did it...jojen gives bran the choice...back to ur family, back to safety or into the unknown to find 3EC...showing that Bran making the big sacrifice, giving up family for the good of the world (according to show)
Jon/Karl fight...jon was doing ok, not not geat but ok, till karl spit in his eye, mocking him about honor...its not that Jons a shitty fighter, like Karl said, he never learnt to fight dirty
Awesome....sword through mouth 
Rast running alone in the forest...raped/disposed of earlier woman?
Yaaa Ghost!!! Woo hoo!!! 
Jon following in LC Mormonts footsteps, offering wildlings protection south of the wall...build up for his reason to shelter all of them against everyones wishes in the future
Rasts GOTTA come back as a wight, would be amazing too, exactly like a zombie movie 
Ok im done for now...gona take a break...hope I dont piss off everyone with this post
1315	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-05-05	Pouring one out (of a skull) for THE FOOKING LEGEND OF GIN ALLEY Â<U+0099>, you were a fantastic dickhead.Â  Hopefully Burn Gorman is on to a bigger and brighter future, perhaps including the lead role in a Willem Defoe biopic.
Â 
Backstabbed by a daughter-wife, right after spitting in Jon's eye and praising the pros of Not Fighting With Honor.Â  And then Jon flanked him like a boss.Â  A backstabby boss.Â  CONCLUSION:Â  Jon "know nothing" Snow learning how to not fight with honor when necessary.Â  Here's hoping anyway, it's a valuable lesson to learn, especially when you're fixin' to be The Hero of this whole shebang.Â  Now that Ghost is back, there should be plenty of opportunity for effective dishonorable flanking.Â  Was half expecting Ghost to bring the pain on THE FOOKING LEGEND OF GIN ALLEY Â<U+0099>, but there's fine closure in it being a daughter-wife.
Â 
Really enjoyed the finer points of how and why they kept Jon and Bran from meeting.Â  Locke fudging his recon report to lead Jon away from where he'd find him, and Bran making the sacrifice/tough decision not to let Jon know he's alive.Â  Which is back in concert with the books, even though Bran's making the decision in a different spot and with different people around.
Â 
And mentioned already in passing, but how about the loafer of the Direwolves, GHOST, finally putting in some work?Â  Welcome back, whitey.Â  As soon as Edd's mutineer head count came up short, and Rast was named as the short head, you just knew what was coming.Â  No kill-stealing here, Ghost finally got to add a deserved notch to his score-sheet.
Â 
Screw Dany, HODOR~! is the true Breaker of Chains.Â  Did not expect Locke to go down this quickly, but it's a good time and a good way to write him out.Â  Dummy made his move on Starksassination too quickly (where's Rickon?) and paid the price.Â  Also liked Hodor staring accusingly (and fearfully) at his hands, reminding us that Regulatin' on Locke is very much not his nature, and laying the groundwork for how This Is Not Okay, even though it was for the greater good this week, Bran is going down an unpleasant path by Warging Into Hodor.
Â 
I guess Locke WON'T be the man whose ear Brienne bites off, after all.Â  Even though it sounds like she's heading that way.Â  She thinks Sansa's heading off to meet Jon at The Wall.Â  Dead wrong, of course, as we know, but it's a better plan than her book plan.Â  Come to think of it, why didn't she think of that possibility in the books?Â  I guess Cat wouldn't have mentioned Jon's existence  but then how did she learn about Jon as a possibility in the show?Â  Maybe Jaime remembered him, I guess.
Â 
So Ser Milady has a plan, and a still-unclaimed reservation at Ear Restaurant.Â  Plenty to look forward to.
Â 
MACE TYRELL SHOWED UP THIS WEEK.Â  Maybe next week he'll get to actually talk.Â  He's the one judge we didn't see Cersei talk to this week, she still owes him a lobbyin'.Â  Also got half of Loras' head in one shot.Â  That's a pretty successful week for Male Tyrells.
Â 
"Meryn Trant?Â  The so called best swordsman of all time got killed by Meryn Fucking Trant?"Â  Awesome.Â  Loving The Hound.
Â 
Sophie Turner with the greatest "fuck this" face while trying to get some sleep listening to Aunt Lysa's O-voice.Â  And "Alayne" is a niece now.Â  Hrmm.Â  As a fan of Sansa playing "bastard" laying the groundwork for appreciation of and reuniting with Jon Snow someday, I'm disappointed by this change.Â  But really, it's probably not that big a deal overall, just to me.
Â 
I guess it makes the proposed marriage to Robin less squicky and incesty if they're not "officially" step-siblings already.
Â 
Speaking of which, fucking love the little detail of Robin being overjoyed to see "Uncle" Petyr, adoring the little glass falcon gift, but immediately losing interest in it and chucking it out the Moon Door.
Â 
Speaking of which, Lysa is crazy as hell.Â  Manic Much?Â  From almost breaking Sansa's hands to cradling her head in seconds.Â  Oh, and how about getting the big reveal about how she lied in letter to Cat, and actually was the one who poisoned Jon Arryn.
Â 
CERSEI REMEMBERED MYRCELLA EXISTS.Â  Way to take the first step on that path to not being a shitty mom!
Â 
Kinda was hoping for a tension-breaking joke, or any sort of light hearted one-liner, from the newly crowned King Tommen I.Â  I guess the smile is enough for now.
Â 
In other kingsguard recaps, Pod goes the idiot-savant route by being completely useless to Brienne and annoying her until she finally asks "Did you do ANYTHING useful as Tyrion's squire?" to which Pod of course reminds us of the time he made the world a better place by ganking Mandon Moore with a spear (though Moore goes unnamed).Â  And then Brienne throws him a bone by letting him undo her straps.Â  D'awwwwww.
Â 
Oberyn appeared in this episode and did NOT have sex with anyone.Â  Fortunately his Average Lays Per Episode (ALPE) is still in fine shape thanks to that foursome that got interrupted by Tywin two weeks ago.
Â 
Speaking of which, Tywin is at last admitting that The Iron Bank is a problem.Â  When Tywin says "you do NOT fuck with these guys" guess what?Â  It means you REALLY don't fuck with these guys.Â  And we get a tangible reason why, even in a "post-war" scenario, the Lannisters still need the Tyrells.Â  The Gold Mines are OVER, the crown still owes that debt Robert racked up, so letting the second richest family marry into the crown means they can use the Tyrells to pay off the debt.Â  Of course, once upon a time the Tyrells were a major creditor of Robert's crown themselves.Â  So much for getting that back 
Â 
And Dany knows that Joffrey is dead.Â  Barristan The Smug thinks they can take King's Landing NOW.Â  Daario takes a shot at us book readers waiting decades for Dany's invasion by mentioning off hand "oh yeah, that fleet you need?Â  I got that."Â  93 ships.Â  8000 Unsullied and 2000 Mercs, Drogon is aÂ  Big Boy, and the Offcial Flag Of Team Targaryen is stitched and ready to go as of last week, there is no reason for Dany to hold back a second longer, she's finally got everything she needs to retake her homeland while it's at its most vulnerable so here we go at last with the invaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaait a minute.Â  Jorah The Fedorah, looking even more haggard than usual, once upon a time the man on this team most eager to get the fuck back to Westeros so much so that he was spying on Dany for Varys (where did that plot element go?Â  Did Salladhor Saan steal it on his way out of the show?), is now saying Don't Go Back To Westeros.Â  Jorah does mention "we might not have enough for KL.Â  We definitely don't have enough for the whole country."Â  He does NOT mention that the proposed invasion plan is probably pretty stupid because Stannis the Mannis recently tried the exact same thing and if he couldn't get it to work it ain't working.
Â 
In the end, Dany decides to do what is, really, the responsible thing.Â  Also the boring thing.Â  Fedorah tells her about how Yunkai and Astapor have slipped back into the same old shit without her literally squatting on them to make her reforms stick.Â  "How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't hold my own castle Slaver's Bay?"Â  Careful, Dany, you're skirting close to Robb Stark territory.Â  Just make sure you don't get smitten with somebody below your station and blow your chance at a powe.............. aww dammit.
Â 
Barristan really is getting very non-canon these days.Â  Hasn't kicked an ass since killing that Manticore in S3 E1, all he seems to do is get sauced in Dany's tent and act as Chief Administrator Of Dissing The Enemy in Dany's council meetings.Â  Jorah doesn't even feel threatened by him (and his potential to blow Jorah's secret) anymore.Â  Weird.Â  The actors sold that element well with some solid eyes-only acting last year.
Â 
But I may have enjoyed the "Next Week" preview most of all, what with the glimpses of two long-missing faces I'm overeager to see again.


Â 
Awesome post, so much to respond to, but all I can say is, F#$K THIS NEW DAARIO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1316	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-05-05	I enjoyed the Vale. Although, I liked the action at Craster's I am puzzled as to why the show dropped Coldhands in favor of this plot line.Â Â Cold hands offers action, adventure and makes more sense.Â Â In the end, the Bran hostage story line feels contrived.Â  I did like the peak into Jojen'sÂ  visions.Â Â 


Â 
Um....it's pretty obvious.....Cold Hands is a Stark, likely our missing First Ranger.....same reason why there is no Whitebeard (hiding Barry!) and thus no Strong Belwas and THUS no taking a dump on a city's champion................the fails galore!
1317	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-05-05	IMDB lists Peter Dinklage as being in this episode, so that makes it hard to check if there is one where we was not.
This is the only one I can note.


Â 
If you're in the "previously on" portion, IMDB counts you as in. Or tell me how Bean is in 12 episodes......

I was pretty bummed about no Whitebeard...but to be fair, you can only do that kinda thing in books...even dedicated unsullied would recognize barristan pretty quick...wouldn't make sense for the deception in the show...infact it might have confused them more thinking same actor has been recast in a different role
1319	7th-key	2014-05-05	They have to kill time until Ep 9.


Â 
I'm not quite fond of this episode 9 recurrence. What would be so bad of having a big happen at any moment in the season? Especially since you can really feel how some stories get stretched and other compressed. TV Stannis was ready to help the wall (good job in ruining the surprise) and Jon had Wildlings on is back...
Nope, they have to wait till ep9...
*shrug*
1320	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-05-05	So, i think i never as much laughed watching an episode of GoT. Crasy Lysa is epic. I'm so happy that they kept the same actor for Sweet Robin !
Â 
Sorry, I have to mention this:
When I saw Carl-the-rapist-who-likes-knives-and-curly-hair-just-like-his-mommy bowed before Jon Snow, I laughed thinking "even asreholes bows before Lord Snow"(and "maybe, he likes his hair too"). But then, someone here complained because the Lords didn't kneel before Tommen, they just bowed. Plus, the revelation in this episode that "snow falling in a vision = Jon Snow".The Show seems to insist on "the snow falling on the iron throne vision" Â Well, that got me thinking. The title of this episode is "First of His Name", right ? But, we saw Tommen like what ? 2 minutes ? The coronation of Tommen wasn't the important thing in this episode. Are D&D trying to pass a message ?


Â 
Fail, Jon Stark is a common stark name. As would Jon Snow for bastards............................................................................................................ but..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................do you think............................................

Â 
I would laugh.
1328	Colonel Green	2014-05-05	If providing ships turned out to be the only plot-consequential thing Victarion did in the books, there's approximately zero chance he would make it into the show.Â  Martin never felt the need to build a whole subplot around the Golden Company's shipping fleet.Â  They hired some ships.Â  End of story.
1329	7th-key	2014-05-05	One little thing that bothered me in this episode: Sansa licking her fingers when eating the lemon cakes. Even in the Middle Ages, licking one's fingers was considered bad table manners, and someone as exquisitely drilled in etiquette and courtesy as Sansa would never do it, even while feeling relaxed in front of a family member she believed she could trust. No way.
Â 
...I thought I'd be more disturbed by the Hound backhanding Arya than I turned out to be. I did love Arya's water dancing, though.


Â 
Yes the finger licking thing looked OOCÂ  to me also.
Â 
On the Arya thing, I find it OK; she's been fresh and arrogant since the beginning, and almost without consequences. In contraposition, since Sansa always had to act submissive, she (Sansa) is considered lame and spineless. Arya is lucky her captors seem to humour her.

Â 
I pray that there is no Quentyn, it will be a blessing, LOL.
Â 
I don't really care about Vic, but my guess is that the Greyjoys are going to be more important in subsequent books so they will have to at least have one of them.
1331	Mr Fixit	2014-05-05	If providing ships turned out to be the only plot-consequential thing Victarion did in the books, there's approximately zero chance he would make it into the show.Â  Martin never felt the need to build a whole subplot around the Golden Company's shipping fleet.Â  They hired some ships.Â  End of story.


Â 
There is that dragon horn business...
1332	Colonel Green	2014-05-05	There is that dragon horn business...


Yes, that's the open question.
1333	Cold Hands warm heart	2014-05-05	Cersie, Mother of Sisters. Mistress of Flowers. Daughter of Revenge.
1334	lareine	2014-05-05	Â 
was that fan theory?
Â 
is no one else interested in that tidbit? are they really implying that the realm is substantially funded directly by the lannisters and now they're broke?


Â 
I don't recall hearing that theory before, but I definitely found it interesting and shocking. Â
1335	Tyrion Lannister	2014-05-05	I had no issue with Cersei offering up the Tommen/Marg match. Â I think she suspected that Tywin would make that decision anyway, so why not make it seem like it was her idea and hopefully curry favor with Mace before the trial? Â If the valonqar prophecy is ever introduced into show canon, she's had reason to fear Tyrion for years. Â Now she thinks he's murdered her son, and no doubt believes he'll be back to finish her and her two remaining kids--unless she can make sure he loses this trial and is executed. Â To get the weight of that prophecy off of her shoulders, I can see her going to great lengths and doing things she finds distasteful, like cozying up to Marg.
1336	Misnthropia	2014-05-05	How comes all the purists arent yelling about LF saying Sansa is his neice and not bastard daughter?
Â 
They are. Trying reading a few more pages. Not that it really matters in the end. 
All the additions to Aryas list! How come joffery wasnt on it though? Indicating she knows he's dead???
Â 
Very first name.
How come all the haters didnt say Lysa talking about Cats sweet tooth wasn't a filler?
Â 
Because in a way, its also showing the viewers how a) jealous she was of Cat  batshit crazy she is, she goes from feeding Sansa lemoncakes to 11 in a heart beat and c) is also instilling some doubt in Sansa, shes that weird relative that insults you but does it in a way that it makes you feel guilty. It also told us how LF brought the lemons especially for her and lead to the interrogation of Sansa. Totally acceptable filler IMO. 
Here's another one for u purists...Brienne/Pod horse ride? Not filler?
Â 
Setting up for Lady Stoneheart. Showing the growth between Pod and Brienne and also making us feel sympathetic for them only for Lady Stoneheart to hang em up.

Brienne seemed so impressed that pod killed a kingsguard...I almost thought shes gona climb on her high horse and start yelling at poor kid for stabbing him from behind...guess that kind hate only for Kingslayer? Or maybe they showing shes growing up and not judging everyone so quickly.
Â 
A bit like the scenes with her and Jaime. She is so quick to judge only for her to be mistaken. She realized that Pod is extremely loyal and would do anything he can to help. Much like she realised that theres more to Jaime than the Kingslayer. Again, setting up the relationship for LS.
1337	pleonasm	2014-05-05	I just have to restate how in-conceived and poorly executed the entire Lock subplot was this season. I like the actor and his performance, but what a train wreck.
Â 
Let's recap. Locke is sent on an assassination mission to wipe out the remaining Stark heirs in the North. He miraculously moves from the Dreadfort to Castle Black in record time while the Wildling's mill about in the Reach eating and killing locals. He then ingratiates himself with Jon Snow, presumably to eventually kill him at an opportune moment. He, logically, then joins Jon's mission to kill the Night's Watch rapers at Craster's Keep.
Â 
For some reason, Locke of all people is sent to scout Craster's Keep. The one guy on the mission who has never ever seen Craster's camp?!?! What the hell? He then super conveniently stumbles onto Team Bran and decides during the planned assault he is now going to kidnap Bran? To what end? He is going to take Bran south to the Boltons? Past Castle Black and rest of the Night's Watch? Even though, he was sent to kill off heirs?Â 
Â 
It hurts my head....Â
1338	NightStark	2014-05-05	Â Wildling's mill about in the Reach eating and killing locals.

Â

Â 
Wildlings in the Reach?. Someone send a raven to Willas immediately:p
Â 
Exactly..he's sent to kill the heirs, how is he going to find Rickon unless he gets it out of Bran? It was never suggested that he'd cross the Wall with Bran, presumably he was taking him away from Craster's so he wouldn't be found extracting the info from him by the NW.

1339	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-05-05	Hodor was pretty 'Johnny on the spot' freeing Jojen and Meera - took him about 15 seconds from the time he left Bran's side until they all popped back on screen.
Â 
How did Hodor heal so immediately after having a spear stuck through his leg?
Â 
Why exactly did Bran allow them to do endure captivity for so long if the entire time he had the ability to lead their escape?
Â 
If Jon is as overprotective as everyone seems to think, the only logical conclusion is that he'll venture north to find and save Bran. Â It seems to me that Jojen and Bran think so little of Jon that they can't trust him not to interfere in their quest, and they care so little about his safety that they don't care whether he exposes himself to completely unnecessary danger.
Â 
Either Bran and Jojen are dicks, or D&D are shitty writers.

In fairness, it's not an unfair assumption to make on their part.

It's not that they're casting aspertions on Jon's character, more that they realise the absurdity of what they're doing and how crazy it would sound if they tried to explain it.

1342	Martini Sigil	2014-05-05	In regards to Cersei acting out of character by not being completely awful to everyone.... I think that it had to do with that scene with Tywin, and Â thinking that the best way to get out of the Willas/Loras marriage is to not cockblock Marge & Tom
Â 
Anyway, that was my thinking... which would mean that she wasn't actually out of character at all...
Â 
Otherwise:
Â 
No Tyrion.... shocked.
Â 
They do seem to be spelling everything out in the show.... "I killed my husband and lied to my sister for you!"
Â 
But Nymph-for Petyr, jealous psycho Lyssa rules. Robin drobbing LF's gift throught the moon door = hilarious. Â Well "niece" Alayne be a Stone?
Â 
Why didn't Vargo Locke just kill Bran?... how did he think he would get him back to the Dreadfort past the wall?
Â 
Jojen tripping on acid kind of weird... imprisoning direwolves, kind of dumb... raping every other woman *but* Meera? major plot hole.

So Jojen, a complete stranger, was able to instantly convince Bran to risk his life on this absurd quest; yet Jon, with the baseline of already knowing and trusting Bran, would be unable to be convinced to merely step aside?
Â 
Rather than having an insultingly low opinion of Jon, they apparently think that Jon has absolutely no faith at all in Bran. Â I don't see how that's any better.
Â 
I also think it's comical that show!Jojen would lack the confidence to convince anyone of the importance or validity of their quest. Â The kid is a blue light saber and scruffy beard short of being Obi-Wan...

You're aware that in the books when they meet Sam they beg him not to reveal to anyone that Bran is alive?
Â

Sam was staring at him. 'You're Jon Snow's brother. The one who fell...'
'No' said Jojen. 'That boy is dead'
'Don't tell' Bran warned. 'Please.'

Â 
Jon would definitely have stopped them, he said as much to Sam at Castle Black. Do you really think he'd let them wander in a place with Others, wights and a massive wildling army? They managed to get captured by a group of halfwits from the NW, they woudln't stand a chance in Jon's eyes.
Â 
Their story isn't very convincing..they're going to see a three eyed raven ffs. Who is going to believe that?
Â 
Why do you think Coldhands extracted the promise from Sam not to tell anyone in the books? Because if he did word would get to Jon who is the only one who would care that Bran is beyond the Wall and pursue them.

I'm trying to show you that Bran etc. fearing that Jon will stop them is not a show construct. Jojen gains Bran's trust in the show by mentioning the three eyed raven even before Bran does.
Â 
Even in the books they don't want him or anyone to know. CH doesn't tell Sam 'You can tell his brother but nobody else..he'll be fine with it.' He says 'no seekers'. None.
Â 
Do you honestly think that Jon, knowing what is beyond the Wall is going to let Bran wander around there just because he tells him; 'I saw a three eyed raven in a vision'? Honestly? Would that would convince you in that situation?
Â 
Jon might trust Bran completely but there's a point where everyone says; 'No I'm not going to let that happen'.
Â 
Show Bran impresses upon Sam that he has to go beyond the Wall and presumably Sam relayed this to Jon but Jon still said he would have stopped them if he hadn't been injured.

1347	cade	2014-05-05	^NightStark, I completely agree. It would've been absurdly out of character for Jon to let Bran go. I also find it entirely believable for Bran to continue on the quest he'd already been on. It's not just about trusting Jojen. The biggest motivating factor for him has been his own visions.

Bran not wanting anyone to know and never having the opportunity to explain it to Jon is a book construct.
Â 
Bran not caring if Jon knows, despite the assumption that he'll unnecessarily risk his life in response to the knowledge, is a show construct.
Â 
Bran having the opportunity to convince Jon with the help of mini-Jesus's superpowers, yet deciding that Jon is too much of a moron to understand what Bran, Meera, and Osha all easily understood (and despite the fact that his failure to do so unnecessarily puts Jon's life in danger), is a show construct.
Â 
I understand the difference, hence why I recognize the book construct is sound and the show construct is moronic, hence my making the effort of my original post.
1349	jerzy59	2014-05-05	This morning at work I mentioned to my Unsullied co-worker how ridiculous the big reveal was (the Jon Arryn killing). And he was like "what big reveal" and then "who is Lysa again ?". I don't think the Unsullied get how this is a major reveal.Â 
Â 
Another thing. LF is brilliant. His plots are amazing. No one suspects him for the Arryn murder. No one suspects him for the Joffrey murder. He probably knows (how wouldn't he anyway) that there's a bounty on Sansa's head. And now we're supposed to believe it's ok for him to share the secret with an 8yo kid (who has issues) ? Does that mean poor Sweetrobin will die for that ? I can't see LF being so lousy about that.Â 
Â 
It's like D&D are unmysifying LF's character by making him do two apparent stupid mistakes (having a niece without having a brother or a sister (we must assume he has, now), letting Lysa reveal Sansa's identity to Robin)

Â 
Bran was free to tell Sam(once he got to know him); 'Tell Jon I'm ok but I have to do this..3 eyed raven etc.' but he never does. He obviously wouldn't have been able to do that for Bran because CH extracts the promise from him later but Bran never even tries.
Â 
He knows what Jon will do, Bran etc. already make Sam promise not to tell before CH does because they can understand that their plan would make no sense to Jon.
Â 
I don't understand what Jojen's powers have to do with convincing Jon, he can only use words like Bran. His vision of the tree, his hand burning etc. were all his own visions..the rest weren't sharing them so he can't use them on Jon. All he can do is say; 'We need to find the cave..raven etc.' They have no evidence to actually show Jon, all he could do is accept their word and he wouldn't do that. Not when he knows what is out there. Bran might be very trustworthy but you have to balance risk vs. reward..in Jon's mind there would be every chance that Bran and the crew will die, they'll either be killed by Mance's army or an Other/wight.
Â 
Jon knows that a significant number of his family are dead, he's not going to allow one of his only remaining siblings to walk into probably the most dangerous place in Westeros. Bran saying; 'We can protect ourselves' or such wouldn't convince Jon, they were just captured by the mutineers who aren't exactly on Other/wildling level of awareness.

1352	King Wayne-1st of His Name	2014-05-06	The Good-Â GOT has come a long way from Season 1 with its wigs

Â But at least those wigs on Jamie and Tyrion were, you know, BLONDE.
1354	SarynStorm49	2014-05-06	I don't get why certain people think Cersei was behaving out of character in this ep. Sure, she is less dumb and bitchy in the show, but it's important to note that she only has three scenes in this episode, and each one of them is with someone who has the power to convict Tyrion (Margaery by extension of her father, obvs). She is playing at being calm, although I do believe her mourning is very real. But in certain moments, and I have to habd it to Lena Headey for this, you can see how angry she really is.
1355	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-06	Â 
Bran not wanting anyone to know and never having the opportunity to explain it to Jon is a book construct.
Â 
Bran not caring if Jon knows, despite the assumption that he'll unnecessarily risk his life in response to the knowledge, is a show construct.
Â 
Bran having the opportunity to convince Jon with the help of mini-Jesus's superpowers, yet deciding that Jon is too much of a moron to understand what Bran, Meera, and Osha all easily understood (and despite the fact that his failure to do so unnecessarily puts Jon's life in danger), is a show construct.
Â 
I understand the difference, hence why I recognize the book construct is sound and the show construct is moronic, hence my making the effort of my original post.


Â 
You're trying way too hard. There is no issue of the logic with either scenario. Bran has more than enough reason not to interact with Jon, and his not doing so doesn't put Jon's life in any more danger than it already was. Jon didn't come to Craster's Keep to rescue Bran, since he didn't even know - but had only posited - that Bran could come across the place.Â 
Â 
I think it's been made clear that Bran's journey is of utmost importance, and that he can't let anything stop him from reaching his destination (which Jon would undoubtedly try to do). Bran would only be making it harder for himself and for JonÂ (emotionally and physically, since Jon would have been able to force Bran to come with him in a way that Sam & Gilly could not), by contacting him and attempting to explain his esoteric reasoning behind his decision to travel north.Â 
Â 
Also, Osha quite clearly did not truly understand or agree with Bran's decision, hence why she and Rickon left the group. And to say that Hodor 'easily understands' the reason they're on this journey is kind of silly. I'm thinking his main goal is simply to stick by the person he's closest with, regardless of what he's doing and where he's going.Â
1356	MoA«t	2014-05-06	In the books, it's mentioned thatÂ the Greatjon raided three of the Lannister gold mines.Â  Nothing was ever mentioned of it again in the books.Â  If they had worked that into the show, this might have made a little more sense.

Seems to me they did via how they just did, via Tywin. Perhaps too subtle for most obsessed book readers.
1357	Black Wolf Smith	2014-05-06	The Good-Â GOT has come a long way from Season 1 with its wigs
Â 
The Bad- I guess the cool book stuff with the Cold Hands and the Weirwood Door won't be happening on the show1
Â 
The Ugly- Lysa is gonna be as cat bat-shit crazy as she is in the books2


Â 1Â MostÂ of the Magic from Westeros is left offÂ the show, no Patchface, Coldhands, Ghost of High Heart, or the Black Gate and we have yet to hear rumor of a certain Lady. Least not forget that Jon, Rickon, Arya and SansaÂ don't appear to be wargs. Â I would think that they leave out the CoTF expect season 4Â last ep is name some like "the Children"
Â 
2. Well the actress did pretty good job of acting like that in season 1.
Â 


I don't get why certain people think Cersei was behaving out of character in this ep. Sure, she is less dumb and bitchy in the show3, but it's important to note that she only has three scenes in this episode, and each one of them is with someone who has the power to convict Tyrion (Margaery by extension of her father, obvs). She is playing at being calm, although I do believe her mourning is very real. But in certain moments, and I have to habd it to Lena Headey for this, you can see how angry she really is.


Â On the show it is more then she is "less dumb, and bitchy" They play her like a victim,Â you don't get how much she has done toÂ others, or how truly awful her plan areÂ ( bothÂ as a plan, and what she wants to do to others). At least IMO Book Cersei never really cares that Joff died. Much like Tywin view of Tyrion'sÂ  being w/ whores, its about how his death make her look, and what she is suppose to do. It only get worse at the next one.
1358	Gargarax	2014-05-06	I don't get why certain people think Cersei was behaving out of character in this ep. Sure, she is less dumb and bitchy in the show, but it's important to note that she only has three scenes in this episode, and each one of them is with someone who has the power to convict Tyrion (Margaery by extension of her father, obvs).

Â 
I don't get it either - how can book readers actually believe that Cersei is really cuddling up to Marge and Oberyn? It is so obvious that she is trying to convince them that she's the poor bereft and abused mother and neglected child. Also, book Cersei is certainly not as dumb as some seem to believe. The problem is that by getting her POV, we see more of her weaknesses and irrational decisions, which clouds the fact that, though with some notable exceptions, she is good a playing the Game of Thrones. B&B are not bad writers, they have proven that several times. They won't make us like Cersei (not before the Walk of Shame, anyway). The fact that they got so many book readers confused is actually showing how good their screenplays may be.

Â 
Which is why she stopped him.
Â 
Oh wait...
Â 
Maybe you should try a little harder? Â At this point you're disagreeing with reality (in Osha) and a straw man (in Hodor). Â It's pretty sad...

And how, exactly, would Osha have stopped Bran? She didn't stop him because it wasn't her place to do so. Your points here don't make any sense, and you seem to have ignored the main counter-points I provided in order to... What? Show that you don't understand how logical fallacies work, and/or don't know how to explain yourself clearly? Either refute the points made against your initial statements (which you haven't done), or concede that your complaints don't make any sense when taken in the context of what the show has presented.Â 
Â 
How does Bran not interacting with Jon put him in more danger? How would Jojen's powers convince Jon that Bran must take this journey when Bran's powers would not do the same? How did you come to the conclusion that Bran considers Jon too "moronic" to understand his need to travel north, when Bran's own understanding on his journey is so esoteric?Â 
Â 
The irony of calling someone's argument a straw man while you're in the process of doing exactly that is... Well, it isn't sad, but it is pretty stupid. Â

In fairness, it's not an unfair assumption to make on their part. What person would allow their crippled younger brother, a sickly looking boy, a young girl and a simple giant to go wandering beyond the Wall? It's not that they're casting aspertions on Jon's character, more that they realise the absurdity of what they're doing and how crazy it would sound if they tried to explain it.
Â 
'We're looking for a raven with three eyes Jon, he's up here somewhere'.

It's insightful I think, I'd assume Jon would do exactly as Jojen said he would.
1363	KingMaegorII	2014-05-06	The opening scene where Tommen gets crowned by the High Septon really annoyed me. hasn't happened in the books yet

Cersai needs to cancel the church's debt with the faith ( which hasn't been mentioned once in the show) so she abolishes maegor's law which allows the faith millitant

Ok, well perhaps learn what a straw argument is before you throw the term around incorrectly, and consider actually reading the relevant posts before you respond. Â That way you wouldn't make irrelevant points which were addressed pages ago, and you wouldn't get your panties in a bunch when your irrelevant points get ignored.

You wouldn't that type of instruction would be necessary, but I guess there are always people like you to come around and defy common sense...

The Straw Man fallacy is committed when a person simply ignores a person's actual position and substitutes a distorted, exaggerated or misrepresented version of that position. This sort of "reasoning" has the following pattern:

1366	oierem	2014-05-06	It's not the most important thing in the episode, but why the heck haven't they changed the credits sequence yet? I understand they can't change it every week, but this was annoying: five episodes and still the same title sequence, no Eyrie (and yet neither Dragonstone nor the Dreadfort appeared), Connleth Hill not credited (but appeared) while Jerome Flynn credited (but without appearing). Who's in charge of that?
1367	BrienneofQarth	2014-05-06	Honestly? This was without doubt my least favourite episode of the show so far out of any season. It completely lacked pace or tension. And my main problem was that it just didn't justify some of the book/show deviations-
Â 
a) All of the Craster's captivesÂ stuff, I wasÂ  sitting there justifying the changes byÂ thinking - "this is going to be a really super-amazing way to introduce Coldhands. Coldhands he will save themÂ yes!" Â Right down to that bit at the end with the threat of the randomly-night-watchy-Â Vargo Hoat I was like, "Coldhands!"Â - but NO. This leads me to doubt whether they willÂ  introduce him....in the same way I am beginning to doubt Stoneheart is coming.Â  For me, these two characters are the best thing about the post Red Wedding books, and the distinct lack of even a foreshadowing of either so far this Season makes me kinda bored. Also, Jojen's part in Craster's, especially Jojen'sÂ burny handÂ -Â I found this a little stupidÂ - my mainÂ problem (and this might be a bit daft), is ifÂ he really could produce fire from his fingers and this wasn't a trick, Â then why didn't he burn through some ropes? I also thoughtÂ Jojen's wholeÂ 'don't talk toÂ Jon, Bran' stuff was a bit of very clumsy exposition.
 speaking of very clumsy exposition - Dany's scene - we got no visuals at all of the troubles in Yunkai or Astapor, Just some rather clumsy dialogue that was basically like "so this is why she isn't going to invade Westeros for the next 20 hours minimumÂ of footage"
c)Â The HoundÂ still being onÂ Arya's kill list - Who knows, maybe they will show her taking him out of it next episode, but I feel like his still being on the kill list at this late stage in their relationship sort of undermines how close they have become. I think the lack of the Mountain in the last few seasons of theÂ showÂ also makes his presence onÂ Arya's kill list a bit less justifiable than it plainly is in the books. I am really getting hacked off at how little the Mountain has been portrayed - if the Viper vs the Mountain is the crucial 9th episode, I really think he should have been a bit more present throughout to make the dramatic effectÂ this episode strong.
Â 
TheÂ silver lining:
Â I did, however, like the bits of possible book foreshadowing - Arya's expanded kill list including both Red Priests,Â Thoros and Melisandre suggests to me, maybe that theÂ followersÂ of the faith of Rh'llor may yet be defeated, for better or for worse.
1368	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-06	Â 


How comes all the purists arent yelling about LF saying Sansa is his neice and not bastard daughter?
Â 
They are. Trying reading a few more pages. Not that it really matters in the end. 
All the additions to Aryas list! How come joffery wasnt on it though? Indicating she knows he's dead???
Â 
Very first name.
How come all the haters didnt say Lysa talking about Cats sweet tooth wasn't a filler?
Â 
Because in a way, its also showing the viewers how a) jealous she was of Cat  batshit crazy she is, she goes from feeding Sansa lemoncakes to 11 in a heart beat and c) is also instilling some doubt in Sansa, shes that weird relative that insults you but does it in a way that it makes you feel guilty. It also told us how LF brought the lemons especially for her and lead to the interrogation of Sansa. Totally acceptable filler IMO. 
Here's another one for u purists...Brienne/Pod horse ride? Not filler?
Â 
Setting up for Lady Stoneheart. Showing the growth between Pod and Brienne and also making us feel sympathetic for them only for Lady Stoneheart to hang em up.

Brienne seemed so impressed that pod killed a kingsguard...I almost thought shes gona climb on her high horse and start yelling at poor kid for stabbing him from behind...guess that kind hate only for Kingslayer? Or maybe they showing shes growing up and not judging everyone so quickly.
Â 
A bit like the scenes with her and Jaime. She is so quick to judge only for her to be mistaken. She realized that Pod is extremely loyal and would do anything he can to help. Much like she realised that theres more to Jaime than the Kingslayer. Again, setting up the relationship for LS.

thanks for replies!Â
1369	Lord of Winterhell	2014-05-06	It would be pretty hilarious if Victarion and that entire plotline were entirely eliminated with a throwaway line from Daario about getting 93 ships for Dany. Ditto if Quentyn's storyline was reduced to the single line "Some random asshole accidentally freed the dragons."


Â 
Well that's exactly what happened in the books imo
1370	Lord of Winterhell	2014-05-06	Either Bran and Jojen are dicks, or D&D are shitty writers.

Â 
Or maybe just show characters make sometimes wrong or illogical decisions, as do their book counterparts, and as we all do in real life.

Yeah, this really bothered me as well. They already have the model for the Eyrie, they "only" need to change the flight path. I don't know if this was done for budget reasons or if it was an oversight. I really think they should make a bit more use of the title sequence, as it helps people to know where things are and also acts like a little teaser to get hyped when you learn where this episode takes you.
Â 
They also credtied Coster-Waldau (first credit), when he only appeared for the three seconds total, standing guard with no dialogue..Â

If anything, him not being introduced yet just means that he might be saved until they really need his character involved, when his introduction will have a bigger impact perhaps.
Plus, it's possible that D+D know that introducing CH now could very well reveal a book spoiler regarding his identity.

Â 
Excellent point!! while i was bummed about no CH last season, i didnt even think about it...IMO im just 100% sure than CH=benjen Stark, im sure alot of other people think along these lines with varying levels of certainty...
Â 
if they introduced in the show one of 2 things happen -Â 
Â 
1) they get the same actor who played Benjen and then eveeeeeeeeeryone KNOWS thats him because of casting
2) they get new actor and then all us (sullied) will be super confused
Â 
either way, big spoiler for us...think of Artsan/Whitebeard...main reason to skip that whole thing was because there are some tricks that authors can use in books but that just aren't possible when people can actually SEE the characters
1380	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-06	I think he was pointing out, though not intentionally, that a) he didn't know squat about fighting without armor or water dancing and  even if water dancing could beat armor, Arya was just a beginner. Yeah of course Syrio couldn't beat the hound any more than a guy with no armor and only a spear could beat a big guy in heavy plate ;/


I wouldn't say that Oberyn COULDN'T beat Gregor. If he wasn't so concerned with getting a confession he could've finished him when he got him on the ground. I understand your point though.Â

Â 
im going to have to re-read the fight (after ep 8 airs) to confirm, but I remember getting the feeling that Oberyn was just toying around with Gregor...i have this image in my mind that Oberyn was pretty much walking circles around Gregor, cool as a cucumber and Gregor was huffing and puffing and sweating and struggling to keep up and get a shot in
Â 
cant wait to see how it is depicted in the show!Â
1382	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-06	"I saw you die tonight, I saw you burn. I saw the snow fall down and bury your bones"

Epic line.


 Â Jojen is a BAMF. I'm loving the actor who portrays him.

Yea I agree with you. My impression was that he outfought Gregor and could have finished him off if it wasn't for his desire to draw a confession out of him. I believe GRRM wanted everyone to be thinking holy crap Oberyn is really kicking Gregor's ass, he's going to beat him and Tyrion is going to get off, then bam everything goes to shit. He had the perfect strategy to take down a huge guy in heavy plate. He even had him pinned on the ground, but he needed that confession so bad that it ended up backfiring on him. The other thing is he knew Gregor was dead regardless, considering he poisoned the spear. So at that point all he cared about was a confession. It's really too bad, but arguably the most epic scene in the series IMO.
Â 
Edit: On a side note is it wrong that I'm really interested to see Gregor crush Oberyn's head? Don't get me wrong I hate Gregor and love Oberyn, but it's just such a brutal moment that I'm very interested to see how it will turn out on screen. Should be graphic enough to make Tyrion puke.Â

I think most of the acting in this episode was strong actually. The only two I wasnt that impressed with are LF and Dany/Emilia. They seemed much weaker than the others this episode. (I'm not a big fan of LF's actor at all this season actually)
1385	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-06	Yea I agree with you. My impression was that he outfought Gregor and could have finished him off if it wasn't for his desire to draw a confession out of him.

agreed with all of it!Â
1386	The Lizard King	2014-05-06	My thoughts:
Â 
-As someone earlier in the thread pointed out, Bran killing the man who maimed Jaime (who in turn maimed Bran) is an interesting touch.

1387	Child of Summer	2014-05-06	Loved the episode... One question though: Did King Tommen just get crowned (anointed) by the Holy Septon? Because that means there goes a really great storyline from the book! I'm really looking forward to the High Sparrow!
1388	binhorde	2014-05-06	You hear the crows right before Ghost rips Rast's face off? This confuses me quite a bit. Presumably Bran let Ghost out of the cage, but he did say in his dialogue "we have to free Summer" and nothing about Ghost. And of course the actor playing Sam said Coldhands is cut, and I would think if he was ever going to show up this episode would have been the time. So, I don't think it was him.
Â 
So then what are they trying to insinuate with that? I mean so far in the series they've used the sound of crows to symbolize a White Walker is near. Does this mean one of them released Ghost or what? Or is Ghost himself one of them (which unless that's coming in the final 2 books, would be quite a story change). It's obvious it was there for a reason. I mean they added the sound of it in the editing process. So it was not a mistake and absolutely meant something. But with no Coldhands...I don't know what it could possibly be.
1389	Cold Hands warm heart	2014-05-06	Where is Shae? Did she make it to Pentos?
1390	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-06	Where is Shae? Did she make it to Pentos?

Â 
Bran saw Ghost when he warged Summer just before they were caught. I don't think he would just release Summer and abandon Ghost.

Â 
 
Â 
i have three theories...
Â 
1) Hodor likely released him as well while they were escaping and the crows were just a coincidence, they could be afraid of Ghost being a direwolf and all
2) Hodor released him and the crows signifying that WW's are close by and Jon & Co. about to be attacked
3) CH released him and crows were cawing because he was near, Ghost recognizes his scent as a Stark is cool with him, hates Rast more so goes after his ass
Â
1393	King Blackwood	2014-05-06	I am a little behind but is anyone else bothered that Sansa and Petyr sailed to the Vale and still had to pass the Bloody Gate?


This bothered me too.
1394	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-06	This bothered me too.
I posted (i think, unless the forum ate my post again) that the Bloody Gate appears to be in.the position of the Gates of the Moon from.the books, rather than as an entrance to the Vale
1395	RenlyTheOneTrueKing	2014-05-06	I don't get to see the promo, is Ramsey "the flayer" Bolton in the next episode?
I hope so!

Oberyn kind of screwed himself over twice, in fact.Â  First by altering the poison to kill more slowly (as noted by Qyburn), and second by getting too close during the actual combat.
1397	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2014-05-06	I don't get to see the promo, is Ramsey "the flayer" Bolton in the next episode?
I hope so!yes under attack by the iron born it seems
1398	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2014-05-06	Ramsey was cut all across his chest...of course with him that could have just been foreplay
1399	RenlyTheOneTrueKing	2014-05-06	Thanks, he better not die!
1400	Ghost wind	2014-05-06	I know everyone is upset about Cersei's "whitewashing" this episode but I don't understand how anyone wouldn't get that she is doing it to bring the judges to her side. I mean the way she says that Tommen needs someone makes clearly is hurting her inside to say it! You can see it in her facial expressions and btw very well played by Lena Headey! I think she was brilliant today
1401	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-06	Oberyn kind of screwed himself over twice, in fact.Â  First by altering the poison to kill more slowly (as noted by Qyburn), and second by getting too close during the actual combat.


Yea this is true. However, it's nice to know how much Gregor suffered before he died.
1402	Ghost wind	2014-05-06	I am re watching now and something bothered me. Barristan said: "They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years". Really? Years? I always thought the events from aGoT to a DwD didn't take more than a year, two at most. How is it that Joffrey's war lasted for years? I mean if 5 years f.ex. had passed I think they would have aged especially the children. Anyone has any ideas regarding that?
1403	ChildoftheTropicalForest	2014-05-06	Nice off pg tie up from last week at Craster's...liked fight scene (with exception of course for Karl forgetting about fight with Jon to turn attn. to Craster's daughter, little heroine that she was) badass image of Longclaw(?) extending through Karl's mouth.Â  What a great villian, and didn't we just love hating him?
Â 
Loved the bit of forecasting for Bran's arc showing the Weirwood.Â  Future scenes need to show Meera's badassery, in this ep. she was like Dudley Dooright's Nell, come on already, she's an archer,Â Crannogwoman forÂ Chris'sake.Â  She's Jojen's protection, show some of that please.
Â 
Was expecting CH (I know just wishful thinking) when Ravens were gathering, must have been BR.Â  Liked that Rast taken out by Ghost.Â  Will he be wighted, since he was the only one not burned?Â 
Â 
Coronation sequence nicely done, is Cersei being niced up for a fall in season 5?Â  Liked that Myrcella & Sand Snakes mentioned, perhaps an introduction of characters for next season?Â Â Liking NewDaarioÂ since he'sÂ finally being portrayed as the character we are more familiar with. Loved his "I heard you like ships" line.Â 
Â 
Show stealer definately crazy Lysa, will we see a snow castle soon?Â  Odd that Alayne is Petyr's neice.Â  Since he married Lysa Sansa is his neice by marriage...is this a good cover story since all of Westeros is looking for her?Â  Generally enjoy Arya & Hound scenes, this one was not the most well written but moving their journey along I suppose.
Â 
For all the scenes off page I did enjoy it and as always, await with baited breath for Sundays! lol
1404	DenzelSW	2014-05-06	I am re watching now and something bothered me. Barristan said: "They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years". Really? Years?

I mean if 5 years f.ex. had passed I think they would have aged especially the children. Anyone has any ideas regarding that?


I always pictured it as being about 2 years for the first two books, an 1.5-2 years for the 3rd. So Joffrey would've rained about 3 years in my opinion. The children did age quite a bit, just look at bran and arya, they changed alot from season 1-4
1405	The Lizard King	2014-05-06	Was expecting CH (I know just wishful thinking) when Ravens were gathering, must have been BR.Â  Liked that Rast taken out by Ghost.Â  Will he be wighted, since he was the only one not burned?Â 


Â 
It depends upon how much of Rast was left after Ghost was finished with him.
1406	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-05-06	Â But at least those wigs on Jamie and Tyrion were, you know, BLONDE.


Â 
Yeah, what's up with that?Â
1407	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-05-06	Honestly? This was without doubt my least favourite episode of the show so far out of any season. It completely lacked pace or tension. And my main problem was that it just didn't justify some of the book/show deviations-
Â 
a) All of the Craster's captivesÂ stuff, I wasÂ  sitting there justifying the changes byÂ thinking - "this is going to be a really super-amazing way to introduce Coldhands. Coldhands he will save themÂ yes!" Â Right down to that bit at the end with the threat of the randomly-night-watchy-Â Vargo Hoat I was like, "Coldhands!"Â - but NO. This leads me to doubt whether they willÂ  introduce him....in the same way I am beginning to doubt Stoneheart is coming.Â  For me, these two characters are the best thing about the post Red Wedding books, and the distinct lack of even a foreshadowing of either so far this Season makes me kinda bored. Also, Jojen's part in Craster's, especially Jojen'sÂ burny handÂ -Â I found this a little stupidÂ - my mainÂ problem (and this might be a bit daft), is ifÂ he really could produce fire from his fingers and this wasn't a trick, Â then why didn't he burn through some ropes? I also thoughtÂ Jojen's wholeÂ 'don't talk toÂ Jon, Bran' stuff was a bit of very clumsy exposition.
  speaking of very clumsy exposition - Dany's scene - we got no visuals at all of the troubles in Yunkai or Astapor, Just some rather clumsy dialogue that was basically like "so this is why she isn't going to invade Westeros for the next 20 hours minimumÂ of footage"
c)Â The HoundÂ still being onÂ Arya's kill list - Who knows, maybe they will show her taking him out of it next episode, but I feel like his still being on the kill list at this late stage in their relationship sort of undermines how close they have become. I think the lack of the Mountain in the last few seasons of theÂ showÂ also makes his presence onÂ Arya's kill list a bit less justifiable than it plainly is in the books. I am really getting hacked off at how little the Mountain has been portrayed - if the Viper vs the Mountain is the crucial 9th episode, I really think he should have been a bit more present throughout to make the dramatic effectÂ this episode strong.
Â 
TheÂ silver lining:
Â I did, however, like the bits of possible book foreshadowing - Arya's expanded kill list including both Red Priests,Â Thoros and Melisandre suggests to me, maybe that theÂ followersÂ of the faith of Rh'llor may yet be defeated, for better or for worse.


Â 
Watch more carefully, Jojen sees fire in his hand. When it cuts to Bran looking at Jojen, no fire. It was a vision, nothing more. Probably just more Dany foreshadowing, you know, the best kind.
1408	Queen Ayras Lord Commander	2014-05-06	I miss Varys. Â The show has had so much fun with him sparring against Littlefinger so it feels weird to see Littlefinger ascendant while Varys' only move lately has been to try to get Shae out of Kings Landing. Â I know Varys has some moves up his sleeve for this season and the next one and I know it makes perfect sense for him to lie low while Tywin is in Kings Landing, but I miss him!


Â 
Reread the epilogue from ADWD. His time will come, my friend.
1409	The Taxman	2014-05-06	Â 
I pray that there is no Quentyn, it will be a blessing, LOL.
Â 
I don't really care about Vic, but my guess is that the Greyjoys are going to be more important in subsequent books so they will have to at least have one of them.


Â 
Screw Quentyn. Dude is useless and makes Dorne looked weak as hell. However, they better cast Darkstar for next season!
Â 
And he better look good. I hope they don't cast no angry ugly old dude. Darkstar is younger than Oberyn.
1410	The Taxman	2014-05-06	Â 
Reread the epilogue from ADWD. His time will come, my friend.


Â 
His time will come in the finale of next season.Â
1411	Kikiadiamond	2014-05-06	I think most of the acting in this episode was strong actually. The only two I wasnt that impressed with are LF and Dany/Emilia. They seemed much weaker than the others this episode. (I'm not a big fan of LF's actor at all this season actually)

I liked Little Finger this time- his scene with Lysa demonstrated that he is not in control of all things, which makes his "mastermind" skills appear more human. He looked like he had swallowed some of those lemons whole when he got cornered. 
I agree about Dany, and I usually like her. This episode she seemed really unnatural. I think everything would have been much better if the show was two hours though, lol. Then she wouldn't have had to make her decision to change her entire life's focus (taking the Iron throne) in two minutes. 
I actually like the added story line for Bran a lot, his plot was one of my least favorite in the book but I'm quite interested in his show storyline.
1412	MoA«t	2014-05-06	Pouring one out (of a skull) for THE FOOKING LEGEND OF GIN ALLEY Â<U+0099>, you were a fantastic dickhead.Â  Hopefully Burn Gorman is on to a bigger and brighter future, perhaps including the lead role in a Willem Defoe biopic.
Â 
Backstabbed by a daughter-wife, right after spitting in Jon's eye and praising the pros of Not Fighting With Honor.Â  And then Jon flanked him like a boss.Â  A backstabby boss.Â  CONCLUSION:Â  Jon "know nothing" Snow learning how to not fight with honor when necessary.Â  Here's hoping anyway, it's a valuable lesson to learn, especially when you're fixin' to be The Hero of this whole shebang.Â  Now that Ghost is back, there should be plenty of opportunity for effective dishonorable flanking.Â  Was half expecting Ghost to bring the pain on THE FOOKING LEGEND OF GIN ALLEY Â<U+0099>, but there's fine closure in it being a daughter-wife.
Â 
Really enjoyed the finer points of how and why they kept Jon and Bran from meeting.Â  Locke fudging his recon report to lead Jon away from where he'd find him, and Bran making the sacrifice/tough decision not to let Jon know he's alive.Â  Which is back in concert with the books, even though Bran's making the decision in a different spot and with different people around.
Â 
And mentioned already in passing, but how about the loafer of the Direwolves, GHOST, finally putting in some work?Â  Welcome back, whitey.Â  As soon as Edd's mutineer head count came up short, and Rast was named as the short head, you just knew what was coming.Â  No kill-stealing here, Ghost finally got to add a deserved notch to his score-sheet.
Â 
Screw Dany, HODOR~! is the true Breaker of Chains.Â  Did not expect Locke to go down this quickly, but it's a good time and a good way to write him out.Â  Dummy made his move on Starksassination too quickly (where's Rickon?) and paid the price.Â  Also liked Hodor staring accusingly (and fearfully) at his hands, reminding us that Regulatin' on Locke is very much not his nature, and laying the groundwork for how This Is Not Okay, even though it was for the greater good this week, Bran is going down an unpleasant path by Warging Into Hodor.
Â 
I guess Locke WON'T be the man whose ear Brienne bites off, after all.Â  Even though it sounds like she's heading that way.Â  She thinks Sansa's heading off to meet Jon at The Wall.Â  Dead wrong, of course, as we know, but it's a better plan than her book plan.Â  Come to think of it, why didn't she think of that possibility in the books?Â  I guess Cat wouldn't have mentioned Jon's existence  but then how did she learn about Jon as a possibility in the show?Â  Maybe Jaime remembered him, I guess.
Â 
So Ser Milady has a plan, and a still-unclaimed reservation at Ear Restaurant.Â  Plenty to look forward to.
Â 
MACE TYRELL SHOWED UP THIS WEEK.Â  Maybe next week he'll get to actually talk.Â  He's the one judge we didn't see Cersei talk to this week, she still owes him a lobbyin'.Â  Also got half of Loras' head in one shot.Â  That's a pretty successful week for Male Tyrells.
Â 
"Meryn Trant?Â  The so called best swordsman of all time got killed by Meryn Fucking Trant?"Â  Awesome.Â  Loving The Hound.
Â 
Sophie Turner with the greatest "fuck this" face while trying to get some sleep listening to Aunt Lysa's O-voice.Â  And "Alayne" is a niece now.Â  Hrmm.Â  As a fan of Sansa playing "bastard" laying the groundwork for appreciation of and reuniting with Jon Snow someday, I'm disappointed by this change.Â  But really, it's probably not that big a deal overall, just to me.
Â 
I guess it makes the proposed marriage to Robin less squicky and incesty if they're not "officially" step-siblings already.
Â 
Speaking of which, fucking love the little detail of Robin being overjoyed to see "Uncle" Petyr, adoring the little glass falcon gift, but immediately losing interest in it and chucking it out the Moon Door.
Â 
Speaking of which, Lysa is crazy as hell.Â  Manic Much?Â  From almost breaking Sansa's hands to cradling her head in seconds.Â  Oh, and how about getting the big reveal about how she lied in letter to Cat, and actually was the one who poisoned Jon Arryn.
Â 
CERSEI REMEMBERED MYRCELLA EXISTS.Â  Way to take the first step on that path to not being a shitty mom!
Â 
Kinda was hoping for a tension-breaking joke, or any sort of light hearted one-liner, from the newly crowned King Tommen I.Â  I guess the smile is enough for now.
Â 
In other kingsguard recaps, Pod goes the idiot-savant route by being completely useless to Brienne and annoying her until she finally asks "Did you do ANYTHING useful as Tyrion's squire?" to which Pod of course reminds us of the time he made the world a better place by ganking Mandon Moore with a spear (though Moore goes unnamed).Â  And then Brienne throws him a bone by letting him undo her straps.Â  D'awwwwww.
Â 
Oberyn appeared in this episode and did NOT have sex with anyone.Â  Fortunately his Average Lays Per Episode (ALPE) is still in fine shape thanks to that foursome that got interrupted by Tywin two weeks ago.
Â 
Speaking of which, Tywin is at last admitting that The Iron Bank is a problem.Â  When Tywin says "you do NOT fuck with these guys" guess what?Â  It means you REALLY don't fuck with these guys.Â  And we get a tangible reason why, even in a "post-war" scenario, the Lannisters still need the Tyrells.Â  The Gold Mines are OVER, the crown still owes that debt Robert racked up, so letting the second richest family marry into the crown means they can use the Tyrells to pay off the debt.Â  Of course, once upon a time the Tyrells were a major creditor of Robert's crown themselves.Â  So much for getting that back 
Â 
And Dany knows that Joffrey is dead.Â  Barristan The Smug thinks they can take King's Landing NOW.Â  Daario takes a shot at us book readers waiting decades for Dany's invasion by mentioning off hand "oh yeah, that fleet you need?Â  I got that."Â  93 ships.Â  8000 Unsullied and 2000 Mercs, Drogon is aÂ  Big Boy, and the Offcial Flag Of Team Targaryen is stitched and ready to go as of last week, there is no reason for Dany to hold back a second longer, she's finally got everything she needs to retake her homeland while it's at its most vulnerable so here we go at last with the invaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaait a minute.Â  Jorah The Fedorah, looking even more haggard than usual, once upon a time the man on this team most eager to get the fuck back to Westeros so much so that he was spying on Dany for Varys (where did that plot element go?Â  Did Salladhor Saan steal it on his way out of the show?), is now saying Don't Go Back To Westeros.Â  Jorah does mention "we might not have enough for KL.Â  We definitely don't have enough for the whole country."Â  He does NOT mention that the proposed invasion plan is probably pretty stupid because Stannis the Mannis recently tried the exact same thing and if he couldn't get it to work it ain't working.
Â 
In the end, Dany decides to do what is, really, the responsible thing.Â  Also the boring thing.Â  Fedorah tells her about how Yunkai and Astapor have slipped back into the same old shit without her literally squatting on them to make her reforms stick.Â  "How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't hold my own castle Slaver's Bay?"Â  Careful, Dany, you're skirting close to Robb Stark territory.Â  Just make sure you don't get smitten with somebody below your station and blow your chance at a powe.............. aww dammit.
Â 
Barristan really is getting very non-canon these days.Â  Hasn't kicked an ass since killing that Manticore in S3 E1, all he seems to do is get sauced in Dany's tent and act as Chief Administrator Of Dissing The Enemy in Dany's council meetings.Â  Jorah doesn't even feel threatened by him (and his potential to blow Jorah's secret) anymore.Â  Weird.Â  The actors sold that element well with some solid eyes-only acting last year.
Â 
But I may have enjoyed the "Next Week" preview most of all, what with the glimpses of two long-missing faces I'm overeager to see again.


I love your writing so much!!! HILARIOUS.
Â 
1000000+ for use of the word "ganking."
1413	Newstar	2014-05-06	Yeah, what's up with that?Â 

Well, NCW always used his natural hair colour, and the list of actors who dyed their hair for GOT is a short one. I think PD used a blonder wig for the first season, but it looked pretty rough.
1414	RavenKing23	2014-05-06	Â 
im going to have to re-read the fight (after ep 8 airs) to confirm, but I remember getting the feeling that Oberyn was just toying around with Gregor...i have this image in my mind that Oberyn was pretty much walking circles around Gregor, cool as a cucumber and Gregor was huffing and puffing and sweating and struggling to keep up and get a shot in
Â 
cant wait to see how it is depicted in the show!Â  
I got a totally different feel from it. Gregor kept up with Oberyn pretty well until his head started hurting. Hell, Gregor knocked Oberyn's spear right out of his hands when he got close and again when Oberyn got in close for the finisher Gregor crushed him. I don't think anyone can beat Gregor in close combat
1415	Grayven	2014-05-06	I just have to restate how in-conceived and poorly executed the entire Lock subplot was this season. I like the actor and his performance, but what a train wreck.
Â 
Let's recap. Locke is sent on an assassination mission to wipe out the remaining Stark heirs in the North. He miraculously moves from the Dreadfort to Castle Black in record time while the Wildling's mill about in the Reach eating and killing locals. He then ingratiates himself with Jon Snow, presumably to eventually kill him at an opportune moment. He, logically, then joins Jon's mission to kill the Night's Watch rapers at Craster's Keep.
Â 
For some reason, Locke of all people is sent to scout Craster's Keep. The one guy on the mission who has never ever seen Craster's camp?!?! What the hell? He then super conveniently stumbles onto Team Bran and decides during the planned assault he is now going to kidnap Bran? To what end? He is going to take Bran south to the Boltons? Past Castle Black and rest of the Night's Watch? Even though, he was sent to kill off heirs?Â 
Â 
It hurts my head....Â 


Â 
Absolutely. Â He seemed a bright guy, and yet he does absolutely everything wrong from a Bolton point of view.. but everything right from the perspective of sweeping evidence of the Craster's Keep filler-plot back under the rug. Â If he 'needed' Rickon, don't we think he might have wanted to ASK about him to see if he was elsewhere in the camp before revealing his dark intentions? Â His role was to be incredibly stupid and get killed so the writers wouldn't face the logical outcome of their previous writing. Â A shame, really, as the actor was killing it.
1416	Gustavo	2014-05-06	So.. what's with Jojen and the fire?
1417	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-06	I got a totally different feel from it. Gregor kept up with Oberyn pretty well until his head started hurting. Hell, Gregor knocked Oberyn's spear right out of his hands when he got close and again when Oberyn got in close for the finisher Gregor crushed him. I don't think anyone can beat Gregor in close combat


Yes inÂ close combat.Â The point is if Oberyn were only concerned with killing Gregor and not drawing a confession he could've finished him off without ever needing to get as close as he eventually did.Â

Bran saw Ghost when he warged Summer just before they were caught. I don't think he would just release Summer and abandon Ghost.


Â 
Right, which is what I pretty much think happened. But it still doesn't explain the crows. It was just the episode prior 404 where they had almost the same scene, Rast standing in front of the cage in the same spot, after having left the infant and the sound of approaching crows scaring him off. This was obviously insinuating the White Walkers were near to collect the infant. So, that's why the sound of the crows right before Ghost rips his head off, was confusing to me. They obviously meant to add it, because it was done in the editing process, but I still am unsure what they were trying to insinuate with it. Because with no Coldhands, they have only used this when the White Walkers are near.
1419	Vegeta_Greyjoy	2014-05-06	Poor Sam. His cowardly bully got his just desserts, and people are only satisfied because he taunted Ghost.

1421	Hodor's Dragon	2014-05-06	The exposition wasn't clumsy, the acting was bad. And we don't need 'visuals' to understand what they mean by 'Every place you liberated is going to hell'. It makes sense without seeing it.
Â 
Oh no, I have to disagree. Â Meryl Streep and Sir Laurence Olivier couldn't've sold that line or two as solid reasons for Dany not to invade Westeros now.
Â 
They needed a refugee stumbling into the throne room with the news. Â Somebody human, with lines and a story to tell. Â Ups the ante tremendously over a couple of throw-away lines that will be forgotten in a week or two.
1422	RavenKing23	2014-05-06	Yes inÂ close combat.Â The point is if Oberyn were only concerned with killing Gregor and not drawing a confession he could've finished him off without ever needing to get as close as he eventually did.Â 
If I remeber correctly he was just about to stap Gregor in the eye with his own sword. I doubt he really thought he would get a confession since he was moments from making the kill. He underestimated Gregor's strength. The only way he coulda won was if he used instant poison, once in range of Gregor's sword or hands (even crippled and speared to the ground) anyone would be dead
1423	madprofessah	2014-05-07	Interesting stuff! I QUITE liked this episode. I was on the edge of my seat wondering if Bran and Jon's paths were going to cross. (After the reveal in S4E04 who knows who far B&B will deviate from the books!)
Â 
Did anyone notice Cersei say she has been Queen for 19 years? That's a heck of a long time! And also remember Joffrey saying that his "uncle Jaime"
is a washed-up 40-year old? Well, Jaime and Cersei are twins so Cersei is also 40.
Â 
But I thought Cersei was a teen bride? There's some numbers that do not sem to be adding up there.
Â 
Also, what was up with Ser Jorah saying that they had been fighting "Joffrey's wars fo years" in Westeros? How long, exactly was King Joffrey's reign?Â 
Â 
And whats up with crowning King Tommen when that has yet to officially happen in the books? I, myself, am looking forward to seeing the rise
to power of the High Septon and Cersei being hoist on her own petard.

Â 
In the books, Cersei and Jaime were 17 when he killed Aerys and 17 or maybe just turned 18 at the time of her marriage. Â In the show, they were probably a couple of years older. Â I don't believe the show mentions how young Jaime was when he killed the king. Â 
Â 
I don't think that Joff reigned for more than 1.5 years. Â His 13th name day is the day that Tyrion returned to KL--no more than a few months after Robert's death and he's still 13 when he died. Â Also, Sansa goes from 11 when Robert visits winterfell to 12 when she has her first moon's blood to 13 when Joff died. Â That suggests 1 to 1.5 years of Joff's reign.
1428	dbunting	2014-05-07	Just a thought that is with me now. Did Dany have ships at this point in the books, if so then forgive me and don't trash me too badly? I want to think she didn't, but now has 93 of them, which is a pretty healthy amount.The real question I have is, could they now cut Victarion since she already has a decent sized fleet? Could they just cut the entire dragon binding horn and red priest? I hope not but you never know.

Â 
I think Dany picked up a few ships in Astapor (unless Drogon got carried away and torched them too  ) but it wasn't enough to carry an invasion force to Westeros.Â  Shortly after that she settles in to Slaver's Bay and acquisition of a Navy/Invading Westeros goes on her back burner.Â  So no.
Â 
Daario did say he commandeered the Volantis fleet, which is the one showing up to blockade her in ADWD.Â  I suppose in the show they'll join the coalition against her to get her fleet back.Â  In this light it makes sense for Dany to be upset with Daario acting without her order, since he has made her another enemy by doing so, even if she didn't say this.
Â 
Still plenty of time for her to lose this fleet/have it burned down in the harbor.Â  Maybe that'll be part of the resistance/terrorism the Sons Of The Harpy inflict on her.
Â 
In other words, yeah the possibility of them cutting Vic did cross my mind too but really it's too soon to tell.Â  If they plan to include him Daario's insta-navy won't stop them from doing so.Â  If they don't plan on it, they don't plan on it.Â  [Of course, they also gave Vic's other important feature -- the fire hand -- to somebody else this week, so maybe he is cut ]
1430	Ghost wind	2014-05-07	I always pictured it as being about 2 years for the first two books, an 1.5-2 years for the 3rd. So Joffrey would've rained about 3 years in my opinion. The children did age quite a bit, just look at bran and arya, they changed alot from season 1-4


Â 
Well in the wiki they say that Joffrey's reign is from 298 to 300. He was to be married the 1st day of the century. Also we only get one of Joffrey's name-days in the books. His 13th. You'd think that a King's name-day would be celebrated and mentioned. A tourney would me made or something. So he's reign is barely a year: from 298 to 299 because he died on the first day of the 300. So you wouldn't say has been in war for years with one year and a bit..

In the books, the timeline is indeed 2-3 years (including Dany's first chapter or so, which iirc is before the Bran POV that kicks us off). A Dance with Dragons ends midway through 300 AC I think

The Red Comet appears in 298 AC, shortly after Robert's death. Joffrey died on the first day of the new Century (300 AC). Obviously we don't know things down to the month, but Joffrey's reign would be about 1.5 years or so, yes, Joffrey reigned for approximately half the span of the novels

Jaime thinks when he arrives at Raventree that the Red Wedding was six months earlier, so yeah, about halfway through the year.

Â 
Tyrion said in 2x08 that Cersei became queen at the age of 19. In 1x05 Cersei stated that "17 years" was "quite a long time" for hate to hold their marriage together. And as of 4x01 Cersei and Jaime are both 40 years old, even though Sansa's only managed to age less than two years between 1x01 (when she gave her age as 13) and 3x08 (when she gave her age as 14). I also remember Dany stating in 3x08 "a year ago I had no dragons," implying that less than a year has passed in her storyline between 1x10 and 3x08.
Â 
TLDR, the show timeline is all over the place...but then we knew that.

Loud and clear. But so many book readers here were too busy looking for "whitewashing/character assassination" opportunities so they could get their hate on towards the show some more, and clearly missed it.
Â 
I also think Tywin was (mostly) lying to Cersei, because he knows she's working him, so he worked her right back, that way she wouldn't fight him anymore about marrying Loras.
Â 
As far as the biggest OMFG moment of the episode for my unsullied friends who I watch with, was Lysa/LF being behind Jon Arryn's murder. Got to hand it to them, they pay attention.Â 
Â 
Loved that Ghost ate Rast's face off. Loved Jon making Karl literally reverse eat his sword. Loved Bran warging Hodor, and killing Locke (giant cheer from our entire living room.) Loved Pod telling Brienne about how he killed a Kingsguard to save Tyrion at the Blackwater. (Burning bunny! YUM!) Loved Dany's self-awareness discovery. Loved Bran being given a wonderful grownup-decision about how he couldn't have a moment with Jon as much as he wanted to. Loved the Jon/Ghost reunion. Loved Arya and the Hound - every moment. Want the spinoff.


My wife got that also, she goes " wait didn't she tell Cat the Lannisters killed her husband?" I beamedÂ

He then super conveniently stumbles onto Team Bran and decides during the planned assault he is now going to kidnap Bran? To what end? He is going to take Bran south to the Boltons? Past Castle Black and rest of the Night's Watch? Even though, he was sent to kill off heirs?Â 
Â

Locke wanted to go and in fact had to sell the idea. I think it was to keep close to Jon who might know where Bran and Rickon were. He just got really lucky Bran was at Crasters.

Yes. As for the kidnapping of Bran, why wouldn't he? Bolton sent Locke to "hunt" for Bran and Rickon. I don't recall him saying to kill them. It fits in with the book Roose's MO by having a Stark to keep the north at bay. If he didn't need a live Stark then what was the whole fake Arya plot about? Having a live Bran and/or Rickon as hostages will keep the North from rallying behind someone else. Now about getting a crippled Bran over the wall, well maybe he hadn't thought that far ahead.

1462	courtjezteruk	2014-05-09	A quick scan of the thread seems to suggest that no-one has picked up on the big piece of foreshadowing in this episode.
Â 
The Arya/Hound scene, where she is showing her water dancing skills. Â I picked up on the similarity between this and the Red Viper vs the Mountain, especially when he smacks her down at the end after she stabs him.
1463	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2014-05-09	I just have to restate how in-conceived and poorly executed the entire Lock subplot was this season. I like the actor and his performance, but what a train wreck.
Â 
Let's recap. Locke is sent on an assassination mission to wipe out the remaining Stark heirs in the North. He miraculously moves from the Dreadfort to Castle Black in record time while the Wildling's mill about in the Reach eating and killing locals. He then ingratiates himself with Jon Snow, presumably to eventually kill him at an opportune moment. He, logically, then joins Jon's mission to kill the Night's Watch rapers at Craster's Keep.
Â 
For some reason, Locke of all people is sent to scout Craster's Keep. The one guy on the mission who has never ever seen Craster's camp?!?! What the hell? He then super conveniently stumbles onto Team Bran and decides during the planned assault he is now going to kidnap Bran? To what end? He is going to take Bran south to the Boltons? Past Castle Black and rest of the Night's Watch? Even though, he was sent to kill off heirs?Â 
Â 
It hurts my head....Locke was sent to kill Bran and Rickon. His whole plan was to get close to Snow to figure out if he knew where they were. He stumbled in on John and Sam talking about maybe Bran being at a Craster's Keep. So of course he volunteers for the mission. Thorne's whole goal is that anyone loyal to Lord Snow to die on the mission. So anyone who volunteered was assumed allied with John Snow. I think Locke knows he only has a short amount of time. He needs to get Bran out of there so he can interrogate him before he kills him. He needs to find out where Rickon has gone. I doubt he was thinking of taking a crippled boy back to Castle Black.
1464	The Drunkard	2014-05-09	In the absence of a nitpick thread: Tywin's oh-so-dramatic talk about the Iron Bank wasn't great. It'd be better if they just lifted this passage from Jon's chapter.
Â 
Each of the Nine Free Cities had its bank, and some had more than one, fighting over every coin like dogs over a bone, but the Iron Bank was richer and more powerful than all the rest combined. When princes defaulted on their debts to lesser banks, ruined bankers sold their wives and children into slavery and opened their own veins. When princes failed to repay the Iron Bank, new princes sprang up from nowhere and took their thrones.
Â 
Or some variation of it.

Yep.
1469	The Boar of Gore	2014-05-09	Couldn't find the nitpick thread, but it just struck me that Oberyn doesn't have an escort of soldiers. He's a Prince of Dorne, so he should have a retinue including armed retainers. Details like that show that the writers don't really get how power works in this world.

It's a shame because this is something they did so well in Season 1, with the Starks and Lannisters. The Lannister guardsmen have a great look, and the Starks do too. So where are the Dornish guardsmen? Come to think of it, do the Tyrells have guardsmen?
1470	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-09	Couldn't find the nitpick thread, but it just struck me that Oberyn doesn't have an escort of soldiers. He's a Prince of Dorne, so he should have a retinue including armed retainers. Details like that show that the writers don't really get how power works in this world.

Didnt Bronn Tyrion and Pod meet some Dornishmen in E01, but Oberyn was already in the city?
And iirc the Sellsword captains got.close to Dany in the book too, because she invited them there to talk to (which is when Mero basically calls her a whore and says he "had her" in a whorehouse in Lys)

1472	reserectedjonsnow	2014-05-12	No, "left" and "right" are noticably absent from all of the q.o.t. sceans.
1473	Thelastactionhero	2014-05-04	Now that is how you pull off show only characters. I realize Karl is weird merger between Dirk and Clubfoot Karl, and that Locke is a reimaging of Vargo Hoat, but they both seem so unique that it's better to take them as Â wholly different entities. But seriously, Gorman really fucking sold this role, and that climactic fight with Jon in the hut made the battle end on a real high note. The brutal choreography in conjunction with Karl's taunting add such hair raising tension to the scene. I think my favorite part was that Jon doesn't actually succeed in defeating Karl in single combat. Craster's daughter being the one to really turn the tides felt incredibly fitting, and more realistic than having Jon save the day outright. So yeah, I'm tipping my hat off to Gorman. This is the kind of book deviation I have no objections to, as they facilitate the creativity of the showrunners but remain authentically grounded in the atmosphere of Martin's universe.
Â 
In the case of Locke, I commend the actor's performance, as per usual, but I must say that I was a little disappointed in his death sequence. I guess a part of me was still hoping we might see Bran and the gang rescued by Coldhands, but it's clear now that's just not in the cards. On the whole, I'm sad to see these guys go, but glad that they didn't overstay their welcome, as it would have cheapened them had they been kept around too long.
1474	KalibakCruel	2014-05-04	Didn't like Lockes demise...too quick. Also, because the actor was awesome. Why bring in an awesome actor just to kill him so quickly and without any real emphasis?
1475	Arkash	2014-05-04	Rast does not approve this thread !
1476	Hielo y Fuego	2014-05-04	Disappointed with Locke's death, too.
Â 
I would've liked to see warged-Hodor pull the guy's arms right out of their sockets. That would've been much more in line with the Goat's fate in the books, of course.
Â 
Kudos to the actor, though. He was so good, I almost didn't "mith" Vargo.

Â yeah, I too, was disappointed with the abrupt end to the Locke subplot. I wish they would have left him alive but injured. His death was like Joe's in The Walking Dead. They spent half a dozen episodes developing his characterÂ  as if he's going to be a longterm wrench in the works, and then 'zip' he's dead in 5 seconds.

1478	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-04	Locke's demise was quicker than I expected (Brienne's gonna need to find another ear to bite off!)Â  But at least it eliminates the need to explain how he's going to try to get to Rickon after "committing" to the Watch/saying the words.
Â 
And Karl THE FOOKING LEGEND's demise was quicker than I wanted.Â  Such a fun character, almost a shame to write off such a colorful character/portrayal so soon, but such is Game Of Thrones/ASOIAF.Â  GRRM always makes his redshirts memorable in their own right.
1479	Fat Trell	2014-05-04	He was a FOCKING LEGEND! Six silvers and they were all focking dead!

1481	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-05-04	Locke and Karl, two great characters gone too soon. I wish Locke at least had survived. It was a good development for Bran and Hodor, though. Bran made the innocent Hodor kill a man with his own hands and Hodor looks very disturbed after realising what he did.
1482	Hielo y Fuego	2014-05-04	Bran made the innocent Hodor kill a man with his own hands and Hodor looks very disturbed after realising what he did.


Â 
This.
Â 
Since the show has no easy way to let the viewers know that warging a fellow human is a huge no-no for wargs, they have to illustrate it in some way. And I think this works very well in that regard, even when it's obviously not as clear as it was in ADwD's prologue.
1483	Oakenfist	2014-05-04	The legend of Gin Alley shall live forever! Seriously, that guy kicked ass at that role. Now that's someone I would have liked to be a regular on the show.

Â 
However, I did like the irony behind Bran servingÂ justice to the man who crippled the man who crippled him (Jaime). Oh, Karma does have a twisted sense of humour!

Karl was amazing and creepyÂ and I'm glad he wasn't there toÂ just make Jon look awesome when he killed him. Karl clearly was talented at combat and damn, how dare he spit on Jon!

Think it was more just a red herring for all viewers. Book readers and non book readers expected him to have a large role so it played against the entire audience's expectations.

Â 
Didn't care much for Karl. He was way too grimderp disney-villain-esque for me. I found him more annoying than anything, and I'm kinda glad he's gone. I get that Jon needs bad guys to go up against and what-not, but they should at least be realistically bad. Styr's got a good balance, I think. At least his wildling-aspect makes him more believable.

That seems to be what they always do with the direwolves now. Show them leaping onto a victim and sometimes a quick shot of them tearing at the throat.
Â 
But I bet we'll get a better show of the dragons killing things and people.Â 
Â 
I would rather watch the Direwolves being badass over the Dragons. Dragons are so cartoonish.

1495	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-05	I'm gonna miss Gorman (the focking legend!) and Taylor, for sure. Would have liked them to play a more lasting role (Gorman will always be Qyburn in my head-canon)
1496	acosta	2014-05-05	Also, since they never showed Hodor busting Ghost free, I'm just going to believe that Ghost was screwing with them the whole time and could have torn down those puny wood spikes any time he wanted to.
1497	of man and wolf	2014-05-05	So yeah..they managed to trap summer and then what...place summer in the same pen as Ghost? They dared to open that door, and how do they even lead the wolf into the pen???
Â 
Bran got Summer out and Ghost and Summer parted ways again?
1498	CandleWisps	2014-05-05	Taylor and Gorman were both completely golden in their presentations, they have such talent and I'm definitely sad to say goodbye. Especially to Locke, like everyone said his story was building in such potential but it just ended like "welp...meh"Â  Â
1499	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-05	Also, since they never showed Hodor busting Ghost free, I'm just going to believe that Ghost was screwing with them the whole time and could have torn down those puny wood spikes any time he wanted to.


Â 
Of course he could.  Ghost is the lollygagger of the Direwolves, as evidenced by his long stretches of absence from the show.
Â 
He can do more, but he can't be bothered.Â  Ghost keeps his own schedule, man.Â  Even when he was BORN he was far away from his siblings, off doing his own thing.
1500	Seneti	2014-05-05	Bran made the innocent Hodor kill a man with his own hands and Hodor looks very disturbed after realising what he did.


Â 
Yeah, that scene was awesome. Glad to see that they are showing the disturbing implications behind human warging.
Â 


However, I did like the irony behind Bran serving justice to the man who crippled the man who crippled him (Jaime). Oh, Karma does have a twisted sense of humour!


Â 
I hadn't even thought about that yet. Great catch.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Personally, I found both deaths to be very satisfying, particularly what with one of Craster's wives helping to kill Karl.

1503	Mr. Sven	2014-05-05	Did anyone else not like that fight scene at the end? Â I mean some guy with tow knives is beating Jon who has a valyrian steel sword and has been trained to fight since he was a kid?
1504	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-05	While I was a little disappointed that Locke left us too soon, still liked the head snap and the implication of Bran warging into Hodor. That shot of Hodor looking at the blood on his hands was pretty powerful stuff.
Â 
Karl's demise was fucking awesome though. Sorry Sandor/Beric fans, for me this was the best fight of the series thus far.
1505	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-05	Karl's demise was suitably long and intense.
However, I kinda wish it hadn't involved one of Craster's daughters, but maybe rather Jon Snow showing he's learned a thing or two about fighting dirty, a bit of wildling style or Stark rage or something.
Â 
As for Locke, I see where they were (are?) going with it, but neck-snapped by a possessed Hodor? Weird and a bit anti-climactic. I had hoped Locke would be around longer, and die a bit harder or even escape from this situation. (Guess that's too much to ask, though, since he was there to kill Bran and was not about to leave the job undone)
Â 
As for Rast, I kinda knew he'd be killed that way, but I figured it would be later on.
1506	PhoenixFlame	2014-05-05	LockeÂ   Â I was hoping Hoder would've just fucked him up enough to force a retreat. Seems like a wee bit of a waste, though I looooved Hodor's "fuck I need a Xanax!" reaction to the blood and corpses.Â
1507	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-05	LockeÂ   Â I was hoping Hoder would've just fucked him up enough to force a retreat. Seems like a wee bit of a waste, though I looooved Hodor's "fuck I need a Xanax!" reaction to the blood and corpses.Â
1508	Envie	2014-05-05	I'm really surprised they built up the whole story of having Locke go all the way up there with Jon and the Night's Watch to have him ended so quickly at the hands of Hodor warged by Bran. I seriously thought there would be some sort of confrontation where Jon realizes (belatedly after they've run off) that Locke deceived him purposely (lying about the dogs in the hut) and the real truth of Locke's mission would come out and then Jon would kill him or something. I wasn't expecting Locke to go that quickly even though I never shipped the whole theory of him becoming Bowen Marsh later. I guess they just wanted to work the viewers up about Roose Bolton 'almost' getting ahold of one of the Stark kids and give them a hero moment with Hodor going Hulk mode to snap his neck. It also served the purpose of showing what happens when you warg another human and how that's not so cool - poor Hodor.
Â 
As for Karl, he got what was coming to him and I'm glad they gave him such an epic fight scene with Jon, that was really awesome. The actor they had for him was spot on creepy and a really good fighter. Here I thought he was just boasting about all that skill but he was great - kudos to the focking legend of Gin Alley.Â
1509	Mr Hodor	2014-05-05	So Bran broke the neck of the man who cut the hand of the man who made Bran a cripple. Circle of broken things is complete.
1510	Olligarchy	2014-05-05	Just finished the episode and I can say that I agree. Those two characters and their actors did a bang up job and I'll regret seeing them go so quickly...
1511	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-05	Jon vs Karl was awesome. Burn Gorman's moves with the knives looked really damned cool. Totally bought that character as being this sickly dangerous back alley cutthroat.
Â 
Locke was wasted potential. I was disappointed with how that whole situation played out.
1512	Allison of Tarth	2014-05-05	I'll miss Locke.  Fantastic character.  Karl I could take or leave. Too cartooney.  The fight with Jon was meh and the fatality at the end laughably cheesy. (Gorman will always be Qyburn in my head-canon)

Whoa -- this never occurred to me but it would have been focking great!
1513	PhoenixFlame	2014-05-05	Oh oh funny parallel--Ramsay also seems to use twin daggers in the preview for next week.Â 
Â 
...I'm a sucker for anything vaguely Florentine. Focking hypnotizes me.Â
1514	Mark Antony	2014-05-05	Don't really understand why people thought Locke would be playing the Bowen role. It was obvious he was gonna die once he was on sent on a mission to get Bran. Anyway I enjoyed seeing him get Hodored.
1515	Gebert	2014-05-05	Too quick a death for Locke; he'd started to grow on me.

Great acting on Karl's part, except the final fight. Both he and Jon looked like drunk men trying to do... something. I don't know. They just sort of flailed around, spent far too much time lingering. Oh, and Jon decided it would be better to use just one hand most of the time, instead of two. He should've been half-swording or something:D
Â 
Great ending, though, with the "extra tongue".
1516	voodooqueen126	2014-05-05	The actor who plays Locke, looks like a dude who I flirt with at University.
1517	DemiNymph	2014-05-05	Kudos to both. The Karl character and actor really stood out and is very memorable. Glad he's not a lameo villian.Â 
Â 
1) Locke was killed off too quickly in the show. Are the producers expecting to shock us with another unanticipated death? I thought he would go on further, but the way it concludes make this whole storyline is a bit lame. In the end he is relagated into a useless character who is unable to accomplish anything. It's lame too how he manage to run into Bran so conveniently. This whole storyline development sucks. They should leave this character rampaging in the Riverlands and run into the Hound or Brienne or even BwB.Â 
Â 
2) Locke's death is too quick. Just a snap to the neck and the scene is over in 5 secs? Surely he deserves more.Â
1518	Jamie Lannister	2014-05-05	Never cared for Karl, but it's a shame Locke departed so early.Â 
Â 
There's a weird sadness to his death. As far as his brothers will ever know, he was just a new recruit who died fighting with them.
1519	The Drunkard	2014-05-05	I liked Locke, thought his death was too abrupt.
Â 
I didn't care about Karl, and I'm glad he's gone.
1520	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-05	To be fair to the show, they HAD to show Locke's death at some point - he's a minor character but made a huge mark when he cut Jaime's hand off. They couldn't just have him ride off into the sunset.
He WAS killed off to soon though, his character had more potential.
Â 
Would have been better if Yara's men killed him during the upcoming Dreadfort rescue then having him "join" the Knights watch though
1521	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-05-05	I also enjoyed that they're finally getting into some prophecy territory. The book has so many great mysteries that the show plays down a lot, so it's good to see the ambiguous green dreams

1523	Cas Stark	2014-05-05	The guy playing Karl outdid himself in this episode.

I agree, Locke's death was kind of a let down, I expected they would keep him at the NW longer or have his death be a bigger dramatic scene.
1524	1000AcresAndAHoldfast	2014-05-05	Locke had so much more to give!
1525	Hot Kidney Pie	2014-05-05	I've only seen Gorman in a few other roles.. But he really brought it this time.. Killed every scene he was in.Â 
His little pow-wow with Jojen was 'A Fine Thing'~!
Talk about a fine thing..Â 
That was quite a fight there..
Though Karl OWNED Jon Snow. And Jon is my personal favorite.. But he got owned.
I had kind of thought both of these guys would bite the dust (Gorman especially) last night..
But I was hoping against hope that Locke would survive somehow.
I just knew when you got him and Bran in the same place he was doomed.
1526	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-05	Jon getting owned was a good thing.
He shows that he isn't super human.
Jon is a survivor, somehow he gets by!
1527	MyLittleFinger	2014-05-05	RIP Locke and Karl Tanner, you rose too high and fought too hard. You made the high lords tremble at your common hands, you looked death in the face and laughed. You were lords to your men, though you knew how to follow. From Gin Alley to the Riverlands, to the Dreadfort and the Lands Beyond the Wall you endured. The Watch will never see your likes again. And now your watches are ended.Â
1528	Carne	2014-05-05	Karl would have destroyed Jon had not the girl stabbed him.
1529	sati	2014-05-05	The fact they killed off Locke was just so awful. Waaaay too soon.
1530	Thelastactionhero	2014-05-05	I'm kinda surprised people seem to enjoy Locke more than the focking legend of Gin Alley. Karl as a chracter is over the top, but I definitely wouldn't call him cartoony. Gorman's acting, and the little tidbits we get into his back story, really help create a tense and climactic atmosphere when we finally get to the show down. I was disappointed that Locke went out the way he did, but I guess I just didn't find him quite as mesmerizing as Gorman. Still sad that we won't be seeing either again though. On the whole, I realize that this is all filler, but really, it made for such good television that I could care less. I wish all of their book deviations could be executed in such a stellar fashion.

1537	DaveyJoe	2014-05-05	It's kind of weird but Locke's death has been the biggest blow to me this season.
1538	SoManyVows	2014-05-05	Karl Tanner cemented his case for the Game of Thrones Hall of Fame by offering us two of the single best line deliveries in the entire lifespan of the show.
Â 
"You are a bastard. A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard."
Â 
And, of course ...
Â 
"I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley. A fucking LEGEND."
Â 
That guy had perhaps the highest PER of any character on the show. The amount of badassery and unrepentant evil he exuded relative to his screentime was remarkable. He left such an impression that it's hard to believe that he only appeared in four episodes of the series, and in one of those appearances he didn't speak at all.
Â 
As for Locke, he's probably my favorite character who's primarily an original creation for the show. He was so vastly superior to the slobbering cartoon that was Vargo Hoat that it's hard to fully quantify. His well-established resentment of the "highborn cunts" who lord over the common people created a real sense of depth for the character, making his otherwise garden-variety sadism feel far more organic than it might have otherwise been. Bolton sending him on a mission to hunt down Bran and Rickon pretty much confirmed for me that he eventually had to die, but man, he was great while he lasted.
Â 
All hail Burn Gorman and Noah Taylor! Fucking legends both.

Â 
Actually, as pointed out by Oberyn in ep. 4.01, knives/daggers are the better choice in close quarters because you need a lot of room to move properly with a Longsword. Also, the entire point about this fight was that they are both good fighters, but Karl is the one who is not afraid to pull dirty tricks.

1541	StrollofShame	2014-05-05	Hi, everyone! 
I just figured Locke was the 'dry run' for next season's Quentyn...altho Locke did span 2 seasons & was a much darker character, nevertheless, we got a character's intro & departure in fairly short (not to mention abrupt!) order. Preparing us for the future maybe?
1542	TommenFoolery	2014-05-05	Â 
I seriously thought we were going to get an IRONY moment with Jon saying the stock NW eulogy for him.Â  "And now his watch is ended" etc.


Â 
My question is, being that Locke was on a secret mission, Â when does Roose assume he is dead? Â it's not like he was sending Ravens with updates. Â What is the Westerosi standard for assuming someone must be dead for lack of hearing from them?
Â 
"Hmmm,... we'll it's been about 2 months. Â He must be dead.... Damnit!"
1543	C0bR	2014-05-05	Too bad Locke is gone. They could've used him from some more stuff and the actor was great.
Â 
I did not care about Karl - too much of a grotesque villain - but I give him + points for adopting a Lars Ulrich accent for his focks

1544	Sleeve of Wizard	2014-05-05	I would have preferred to see Hodor simply choke the life out of Locke. The camera angle gave a sense of the great height from which he was dangling at the end of Hodor's arms. I understand the blood on his hands was a vehicle for Hodor to contemplate what happened but more importantly you see Bran getting more militant "ByÂ Any Means Necessary" in his mission.
Karl was just great, but I don't despair as I know there will be more baddies and good actors for that badness.

1546	jarl the climber	2014-05-05	I'm glad Jon and his brothers didn't find out Locke was a bad guy. I love Locke for chopping off Jaimes hand.


Won't the women mention the captives in the shed that the mutineers captured? Won't they notice that there were no hounds in there?Â
1547	Lasicka	2014-05-05	I already miss Joff and IÂ´m sure IÂ´ll miss Locke as well. He was a delight to watch. What a wasted opportunity! They could have milked him for a few more episodes...
1548	CandleWisps	2014-05-05	It's kind of weird but Locke's death has been the biggest blow to me this season. 


Â 
I feel you  The more time passes since last night and everything settles in, the more I actually kinda miss him. so much potential he had. And I agree with a previous poster that Bran!Hodor should have choked him instead. I understand the relevancy of having the blood on Hodor's hands affetc him/the repurcussions, but I feel it might have been better to give us a little more closure with Lockes death, slowly seeing the life drain from his eyes and what not. It just happened so quick I kind of felt whiplash
1549	Stone Cold Bastard	2014-05-05	Would've preferred to have seen Locke chasing after Rickon, Shaggydog and Osha, culminating in a cool chase scene with Shaggy ripping Locke to shreads. Or Locke's true intentions and motive discovered by Jon.
Â 
Didn't care about Karl and don't understand the fascination with him. The character was absolutely revolting and total scum. Yes, he was portrayed well, but such a POS.
1550	Beorn Snow	2014-05-05	Screenwriters missed a golden oppurtunity.

Let Locke take Bran into the dark forest, then end with CrasterÂ´s Keep burning.
Then let Locke be on the run with him for an episode. Not much of a dialogue:
I donÂ´t need you to live boy. I just need your head to show and then I will get a holdfast.
My forefathers were servants, but I will be a castlelord.
And thenÂ 
	Spoiler  let Coldhands kill Locke beginning of episode 7.

That would have been beautiful IMO. Only problem with it is that Jojen and Meera would most likely have told Jon what happened so he could help go save him, even though they wouldn't want to part afterwards

Â 
For him to disappear again in ep.10 when Bran meets the Children?
Â 
Would be a waste of time.
Â 
I know we would settle for that knowing his backstory from the book arc etc. but non readers really seem to dislike characters coming in then disappearing. This is fundamentally a show for non readers so they have to pander to them really.
Â 
I've seen non readers just brush aside some characters as filler or 'pointless' when they don't even know their future story; Sam, Asha/Yara, saw one person say the whole Vale storyline from last night was 'going nowhere'. Generally if they don't see a really obvious direction for a character they think it would be no loss for them to be cut. CH in this instance would be slated.
Â 
We like a bit of intrigue and subtlety, but the show has to be as subtle as a brick sometimes and keep character numbers to a minimum. I'm on another forum and one non reader only realised Jaime was Joffrey etc. father in the sept scene. Guy said he'd been watching since S.1 and never got that and it's one of the foundational points of the story.

1553	Pure Guava	2014-05-05	Gorman/Karl was fantastic. I was insanely disappointed thinking they'd gotten him to play such a tiny role last season, so this was a well-deserved and unexpected payoff for me. As for Taylor/Locke, other than being a brillianit actor and selling the role...I wasn't sorry to see him go since I don't feel like the show needs to continue on TOO long with invented material.
Â 
That said I was really, really, really hoping the way he'd go would be after kidnapping Bran and running into Coldhands. Why no Coldhands, D&D, why??

Doesn't necessarily mean he fathered her children though. Either way he didn't catch it and he seemed to think nobody else did either, he was like;

However, I did like the irony behind Bran servingÂ justice to the man who crippled the man who crippled him (Jaime). Oh, Karma does have a twisted sense of humour!
Â 
Â 



Exactly my thoughts.
1570	Mr. Sven	2014-05-05	Â 
Actually, as pointed out by Oberyn in ep. 4.01, knives/daggers are the better choice in close quarters because you need a lot of room to move properly with a Longsword. Also, the entire point about this fight was that they are both good fighters, but Karl is the one who is not afraid to pull dirty tricks.



I got that that was the point but it felt really ridiculous to me. Â I thought that Oberyn meant when he was trying to draw his weapon or something? Â I find it hard to believe that daggers are actually superior in a sword-fight but then again what do I know about sword-fighting.

Â 
Swinging a huge sword around in a small room will not work well for you when your opponent has small blades that won't catch on support beams. Â This is a common theme in chanbara films.

Well, after everything that Karl and Co. did to them, I doubt they'll be willing to give the NW anything, even if it's just information.
1574	Bastard of the Dreadfort	2014-05-06	Oh oh funny parallel--Ramsay also seems to use twin daggers in the preview for next week.Â 


Â 
Watching Karl's scenes this season makes me ponder what a potentially better Ramsay he might have been... He truly made my skin crawl...
While Iwan Rheon is a fine actor... His interpretation just doesn't invoke the same sense of pure malice and evil that Burn Gorman was able to create in the short time he has been on the show.
Here's hoping that Rheon becomes less of a 'Joker' (for lack of a better comparison) and more of a Karl.Â  Â 
Â
1575	Wicked Woodpecker of West	2014-05-06	Guy who played Locke would be great Vargo. Pity they used him like this.
Burn Gorman should play Ramsay Snow rather than this happy hobbit Rheon.

It's not ridiculous at all.  Why do you think Karl stayed inside?  Because he had an advantage there.  If they had been outside, the longsword would have been an advantage.  I find it ironic that people think this fight was "unrealistic" when it would have been unrealistic if Jon had dominated him.
1579	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-06	Locke and Karl, two great characters gone too soon. I wish Locke at least had survived. It was a good development for Bran and Hodor, though. Bran made the innocent Hodor kill a man with his own hands and Hodor looks very disturbed after realising what he did.agreed. Shame to see an awesome actor and character go but was very powerful and important in showing the moral ambiguity of brans actions
1580	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-06	Loved karl as well - that fight scene was fucking awesome and he had the best evil one liners
1581	Presenteira	2014-05-06	It's not ridiculous at all. Why do you think Karl stayed inside? Because he had an advantage there. If they had been outside, the longsword would have been an advantage.

Well, in my opinion there was space enough to wield the longsword inside. I practice sport fencing and HEMA and I can assure you, reach is very important. I find it very difficult to believe you can efectively opose a longsword with two daggers. All Jon had to do was thrusting instead of slashing.
Â 
It looked very unrealistic to me, almost ridiculous, and out of character because any good fencer who's been trained since childhood (like Jon is suposed to be) would have finished Karl without too much effort. Dirty fighting or not, the disadvantage was on Karl's side.

Â 
I'm not claiming to be an expert, but the fight secuences in general look poor to me, like I don't buy Jaime or Jon or Brienne as really good fencers (the way Brienne grabs Oathkeeper in the scene with Jaime is irking, like she's grabbing a club more than a sword). I assume the choreographers are experts, but perhaps more in stage fencing than actual fighting, or perhaps they didn't have enough time to train the actors...
1585	marsyao	2014-05-06	I have one question, Karl defeated Jon Snow because he fought dirty, so let us assume Karl due with Bronn, who would win?

Jaime, Jon and Brienne are not supposed to be fencers, they're War of the Roses era warriors using lonsgwords. Sport fencing is a renaissance/modern mock combat sport, it is not combat.

Its one of the things that has been missing from Show Jon. He isn't a 'badass'. He is still a boy who is learning. Before the fight at the Mill in S3, the only people he had 'beaten' were completely untrained boys in the training yard at CB and an old Ranger who let him win.

Jaime, Jon and Brienne are not supposed to be fencers, they're War of the Roses era warriors using lonsgwords. Sport fencing is a renaissance/modern mock combat sport, it is not combat. With all due respect I think you have the last part of your comment the wrong way round. The choreographers will be experts in medieval era combat (actual fighting). Good essay on the subject if you're interested - http://www.thearma.o...ml#.U2jir_ldX38Â - "modern fencing includes no equivalent system of fighting to that of the longsword"


Â 
I said I practiced sport fencing AND HEMA wich means Historical European Martial Arts, that is fencing with historical swords such as rapiers and longswords. My opinion was based on my knowledge of historical fencing, wich focuses on historical combat techniques, both by researching ancient sources, like medieval and modern treaties and through actual fighting to test the most effective ways to kill your oponent. So, yeah, I'm aware that modern sport fencing is not the same as longsword fencing.

1610	sj4iy	2014-05-06	Its one of the things that has been missing from Show Jon. He isn't a 'badass'. He is still a boy who is learning. Before the fight at the Mill in S3, the only people he had 'beaten' were completely untrained boys in the training yard at CB and an old Ranger who let him win.Â I am surprised at people lamenting the lack of 'badassery' here. He killed a few unprepared drunks then was beaten in a fight that he should had range advantage. It fits with where Jon is at ATM.^This. He even states in the book that he isn't equal to the sword he wields, therefore he practices everyday with it. He's also bested by Mance after that. I don't get where people think he's some sort of sword master, because even in the show a few episodes back, he said that Robb was better than him at everything, including fighting. He has a lot to learn and this was a learning experience for him. He was better than the kids who had never held a sword before, but that doesn't mean he's better than a professional assassin.

Well Karl was probably the drunkest out of all the mutineers, to be fair.
I liked that they made Jon lose the fight. Let someone be a better fighter than him for once instead of turning him into Aragorn.

I got the feeling he killed him more because Jon pretty much actively helped Stannis, which would put the watch in danger if Stannis lost. Â Which would explain why he killed him right after the pink letter.

This.
Â 
Since the show has no easy way to let the viewers know that warging a fellow human is a huge no-no for wargs, they have to illustrate it in some way. And I think this works very well in that regard, even when it's obviously not as clear as it was in ADwD's prologue.


Well he also wargs Hodor when they have to get away from the whites in book 5.....I wonder if we'll see him do it again ....
1653	Yanninho	2014-05-11	I don't mind the legend of Gin Alley, the actor played it well, but I thought he was on sceen too much, and as a completely filling-time arc, I thought this wasn't that useful.

I don't think Ros counts as the first 'invented' character to die. There's XXD from season 2 Dany. Okay, they technically took the name from the books but he has nothing else in common with the book character. I'd call him an invented character.

Well technically Locke was the invented replacer for Vargo Hoat - so all of those characters (Xaro, Talisa, Locke) were actually in the book but you're right - totally nothing like their book counterparts in the show. Ros was the only truly invented character who didn't exist in the books in any other name / form that I can think of actually - although there was one un-named whore from Winterfell that Theon was fond of if I remember correctly, wasn't there?

Yeah I'm not saying it's a good choice of plot twists - but they've made that girl prominent in a few scenes now as Ramsay's sidekick so if they're going to do the fake Arya story line at all, I think she could be a candidate for it in the looks dept at least - but again, too old.

1659	CaptainTheo	2014-05-13	For me, the biggest adaptation disappointment of the entire season so far is that they killed off Locke. He was an entertaining character and I was hoping (and, to be honest expecting) him to stick around a little longer.
Â 
Continuing the deviation from the books, the scene also perhaps marks the point of the real loss of Bran's innocence. (Who does that leave as 'innocent'? - Sansa, Sam, Tommen, can't think of anyone else.) He used Hodor to kill a man who wasn't even trying to kill him (he was just kidnapping him). He could simply have knocked him unconscious instead of snapping his neck. Very disturbing. I wish he had only knocked him out, also because then we'd get to see more of Locke.
1660	Rheia	2014-10-06	Jon would probably get killed if that Craster's wife didn't stab Karl from behind. Will Jon ever become a better swordsman just like his father Rhaegar was?
Â 
Â 


Â 
I agree, butÂ IMHO fight with a longsword against two daggers is risky business...
1661	The Reckoner	2014-10-08	The arc had its purpose, showing that Jon could step up and take charge. A stepping stone to his role in the next season, which could be an improvement in that Jon taking on the role of Lord Commander feels less like a Gary Stu moment (Check out the Anti-Author Terminology thread for more on this). Here, we have Night's Watchmen who have seen Jon's ability to lead, which combined with him taking charge of the Wall versus Mance Rayder gives credibility to his brothers' decision to elect him as Lord Commander.

1662	warrior of the old gods	2014-05-06	Let me start by saying I have no experience with any martial form whatsoever. In a fight between a guy with 2 knives and a guy with a Valyrian steel bastard sword(1.5 times the length of a regular sword), shouldn't the guy fighting with the sword be able to easily beat the knife wielder? Karl may have been an expert knife fighter, but Jon was trained in a castle by a master of arms. The reach of a bastard sword is quite large. Am I wrong in thinking that the fight shouldn't have lasted long enough for Karl to spit on Jon's face? The fight was in a rather cramped area, but it looked like there was sufficient maneuvering room.
1663	Ser_Hector	2014-06-07	Yes!! you are totally right. Just based on reach alone, a skilled swordsman would at least be able to maintain distance between him and the person with the knives. Plus, it would be easy to hit the person with the knives the moment he comes that near with the intention to stab you, because the moment he tries to strike he loses his defense. That is an important part of swordplay and it's the main reason why in a fight, the sword wielders never tried to connect a massive hit, because in order to do that you need to get the sword very far Â from your body, leaving you awfully vulnerable.
Â 
It was a very exciting fight scene, either ways!! haha
1664	TeamTywin	2014-07-04	While Jon had advantages in reach, Â it's not so simple. Â Real melee fighting (at least in western traditions) occurs at closer ranges than we see in movies. Â It's conceivable that a fighter like Karl with this kind of rough and tumble back ground would be an expert at closing range and getting around heavier weapons. Â His tactics would be likely to throw Jon off. Â Likewise, he would probably be more comfortable using the sort of environment in which the fight took place to his advantage. Â
1665	shmewdog	2014-09-25	Sure ordinarily the knife wielder would be at a disadvantage. Â But this knife-wielder is Karl F'ing Tanner! Â He could take ANY KNIGHT ANY TIME. Â
1666	of man and wolf	2014-09-26	fookin cunts in steel plate...fookin cowards!
1667	Beric175	2014-09-30	Jon Snow learned how to fight dirty from Karl, which helped a lot once he fought the Magnar in episode 9 and it was a nice reference to Biter's death in the books when he stabbed him through the mouth, which makes me think Brienne's story will end significantly different from her book story. Anyone who has read AFFC knows that her story is one of the slower parts of that book so I have no objection to them changing it.
Â 
I find it interesting that to deliver justice Jon had to kill members of the NW, which puts an ironic twist on their victory because they had to kill their 'brothers' in order to save starngers. It also was a rare victory forÂ some of the more unambiguously good characters on the show, which is rare.Â
1668	Mr Smith	2014-05-04	Correct me if I'm wrong, but I remember nothing in the book that suggests the mines under Casterly Rock were running dry. Probably not a terrible change to make, and a nice metaphor for the eventual disintegration of Lannister power, but a radical change none the less. They're getting bold.
Â 
In other news, I'm glad they're emphasising the importance of the Iron Bank.
Â 
Thoughts?
1669	A Man Reads	2014-05-04	[. . . ] a nice metaphor for the eventual disintegration of Lannister power[.]
Â

My thought exactly. The mines are dry; the children are crippled, mad, and exiled; Tywin is killed; the Lannisters are in decline. The gold is more so the TV audience grasps the symbolism.

1670	lil_z	2014-05-04	Yes, the Lanister power without foundations is a nice turn. I also like the idea that they are emphasising the danger in not paying the Iron Bank. I always thought that it needed to be further mentioned in the Books.
1671	Fat Trell	2014-05-04	Not a fan of this.
Â 
I understand the need to emphasize the importance of the Iron Bank, but this seems like a short sighted way to do so. How is this not well known throughout Westoros? Does Tywin have all the goldsmiths, minters, miners, and merchants dealing in supplying said professions on some type of hush-money/welfare program? How was he supplying Robert for years with tourney purses without gold? Was Littlefinger duplicitous in Tywin's fraud?Â 
Â 
ThisÂ screams of something that will never be mentioned again however.
1672	go joff go	2014-05-04	Two things, it would be sort of cool and ironic if the lannisters ultimate undoing is NOT paying their debt to a bank. Second I think they were trying the tighten up the whole why would the lannisters marry the tyrells motive, which kind of doesn't make much sense otherwise
1673	Ran	2014-05-04	It's a fairly silly turn, in the sense that no, it's not thought out, much as their turn with Xaro's "wealthiest man in Qarth is in fact bankrupt" thing -- both raise the same questions. You'd think someone whose father was a banking executive might have at least a little more respect for the fundamentals of economics... or maybe not, I guess, after the bailouts? 
Â 
But in any case, I think it's fairly obvious that the change is there to mitigate Cersei still further. She's not going to tell the Iron Bank she won't pay up because she's recklessly arrogant on the topic... but because she'll have no choice. Boo-hoo. 
Â 
(Yeah, not a fan of the whitewash. She's such a bland character.)

1674	Jorah the Explorer	2014-05-04	I always got the impression in the books that the Lannisters remained greatly wealthy, while the crown itself was broke. Â Separate entities. Â Like as if a rich person was the owner of a bankrupt company, or vice versa.
1675	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-04	Eh, it was kind of funny in an ironic sort of way (and a bit tactless, since Lena Headey is/was reportedly broke herselfÂ   ), but most of all it felt repetitive. Like, we get it, the Iron Bank is powerful and the Lannisters need the Tyrells. They've literally said it in the previous episodes
1676	averde	2014-05-04	I think its just another way to bring up the Iron Bank on the show so it'll be clear to show watchers what a big deal they are when Stannis meets with them in what looks like the next episode.Â 
Â 
Besides that if the Lannister gold is drying up or gone it would explain a lot about Tywin's actions and attitude. This may be one of those interesting tidbit kind of changes for the show that don't really have any impact but do help explain and improve a lot about characters that we didn't see all that much and didn't understand the reasoning behind in the books.Â

But in any case, I think it's fairly obvious that the change is there to mitigate Cersei still further. She's not going to tell the Iron Bank she won't pay up because she's recklessly arrogant on the topic... but because she'll have no choice. Boo-hoo. 
Â 
(Yeah, not a fan of the whitewash. She's such a bland character.)


Â 
This is also a good point.
Â 
Makes Cersei's Fuck You to the IB much less a matter of "A Queen can do as she wills" and more a matterÂ of "Woe is the women left to deal with the debts of her inept husband and lying father."
1678	Ran	2014-05-04	Exactly. I mean, I suppose they went to one another, "Well, why didn't Tywin just buy the crown out of debt?" Because in the book he actively refuses to cancel the crown's debts to him, but I think that's obviously because he isn't going to cripple the Lannisters by erasing debt while everyone else gets to hold the crown's debts to them; it makes the Lannisters relatively weaker compared to the rest, and that's never going to happen.
Â 
So maybe they went, "Well, why doesn't Cersei cancel the debt, at least?" And... probably because she loves being Lady of Casterly Rock and isn't going to weaken herself relative to the other debt holders, either. Better to weaken them by telling them to fuck off or to take stuff she's very happy to give in return for debt forgiveness. But no, that's too significant a pettiness to allow to stand.
Â 
I could, of course, be wrong. But there's obviously been a pattern from day 1 with their treatment of Cersei of filing down the rough edges, so to speak, and this conveniently seems to fit that pattern.

1679	Hielo y Fuego	2014-05-04	This was news to me too. But, taking into consideration that the greatness of the Lions is on the edge of the cliff, I didn't think it such an important change; just a very interesting bit of info.
Â 
The Iron Bank becoming more and more important (and Tywin's words about it, especially) seemed to be the key of that conversation to me, though. Especially now that Stannis is clearly heading to Braavos for a reunion with Nestoris in the next ep.
1680	LordToo-Fat-to-Sit-a-Horse	2014-05-04	"the Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources"

Â 
Â 
how does that make any sense?
1681	Pib_Juju	2014-05-04	It seems like a necessity if you want to make the Iron Bank more of a player in the whole scene. Otherwise, people will ask why Tywin doesn't just pull some gold out of his ass and bypass the Iron Bank completely.

I assume they've got resources other than gold mines. And they do have a big port.

1683	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-04	They probably still have money "running", but they aren't as rich as people think they are because they're main resources are gone.
Â 
Either way, some posters considered this idea at some point, IICR. And it's not completely far-fetched. Also, I like the idea of how everybody keeps talking how Lannisters are filthy rich, and how they don't need to worry about money. It makes sense that it's actually not true
1684	Tim Thomason	2014-05-04	Just because the gold mines dried up, doesn't mean the Lannisters are broke. Tywin is thinking big picture, but I'm sure they probably have a large gold reserve and are actively collecting on debts owed to them by several parties (including the Crown). Three years is about the time frame of the show, so it's interesting that when all heck breaks loose, Tywin decides to get involved in continental politics after his self-imposed exile. Perhaps he saw the writing on the wall and had spent the past 17/19 years investing/organizing/managing the dwindling mines in order to keep the Westerlands profitable.
Â 
Plus, with the war on, people might not bat an eye if the Westerlands cease minting for a while and instead fortify their borders and plump up their armies instead. I'm sure it's an open secret that some of the gold mines have dried up, but only Tywin and his closest financial advisors would know the full scope of what's going on financially at Casterly Rock.
1685	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-04	but yes, it's meh that they're, once again, whitewashing Cersei about this. She won't be not paying the IB because "omg I'm the Queen fuck off, I have more important things to worry about" but because she actually has nothing to pay them with. :/

1686	Emperoreddy	2014-05-04	Cersei will still look recklessly arrogant when she tells the Iron Bank to fuck off. Show is hammering the point home this season that that is the LAST thing you do to the Iron Bank. Tywin has apparently known for 3 years and this episode kind of points out he has been doing what he can to make sure they get paid, which is the prudent thing to do. I really that being a poor Cercei whitewashed moment when it happens.Â
1687	Lucamore the Lusty	2014-05-04	"the Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources"
Â 
"our last working mine ran dry two years ago"
Â 
Â

Â 
The Lannisters aren't broke..........yet. But they will be if they keep lending money to the crown. They still have their own resources for the moment but the belt-tightening is about to begin and someone else needs to start paying the crown's debts, at least till the Lannisters can find another source of money.
1688	Krutoon	2014-05-04	I guess the Lannisters being broke makes sense, because as I recall Tywin was previously throwing money at King's Landing whenever it was called for, and that must have stopped at some point because the Crown owes the Iron Bank a great deal. I feel like as long as he had the resources, he would have helped fund weddings, tourneys, etc. to help Cersei keep up appearances.Â 
Â 
I think y'all are on to something with the show ramping up Braavos. It got mentioned with the Iron Bank and again in Arya-Hound dialogue. I'm sure they're reminding the audience of its importance to get us ready.
1689	D-Shiznit	2014-05-04	It ties up to Vary's line in season 2, "Power is a trick". He probably knows that Lannister's are broke and was most likely refraning from laughing at Tyrion's ignorance.
1690	Emperoreddy	2014-05-04	Â

Â 
They are running a deficit and the wars are bleeding them dry. They definitely have resources and aren't "broke" yet, but they are in the red and can't sustain their own kingdom AND the crown by themselves any longer. I don't think it really changes that much. Its beginning to show their power is waning, but you also get the impression that prudent financial planning and alliances could head off disaster at the pass (which is exactly what Tywin is doing).
Â 
Cercei is just going to drive them off the cliff still.
1691	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-05-04	when he said that, i was like "what?" i think it is just to further emphesize the importance of the ib
1692	Bluecore	2014-05-05	It should also be noted that this entire Iron Bank story line has not been played out in the book. It could in fact be the case that the Lannister mines have ran dry in the books. In fact, I think I remember a passive mention in one of the books, to the effect of "it is rumored that the mines below Casterly Rock still produce gold to this day." That is to say, it would actually be a revealing surprise if the show explicitly said they DID still produce gold.Â 
Â 
I'd also like to point out that, in real life, if I am a relatively upper middle class person, but someone owes me a million dollars plus interest, I'd still consider myself very rich. In the case of the Lannister's, the Crown owes them a lot of money, and the obviously have plenty of liquid capital to live a lavish life style. People who make massive investments in hedge funds, who buy government bonds, etc, they still count all of that money as their total net worth even though they might not have access to it.Â
1693	Emperoreddy	2014-05-05	when he said that, i was like "what?" i think it is just to further emphesize the importance of the ib


Â 
I think that is the main point, but I also don't think it changes much, at least not with Cercei.
Â 
If they make the Lannester's broke, but Cercei is kept in the dark THEN she looks like the victim when the IB comes knocking. This way she is well aware of the gold issue so if she was a wise and prudent ruler it would be a top priority to make sure the IB is happy and other revenue sources are coming in. So she will still look like the incompetent, arrogant queen people expect.
1694	Gneisenau	2014-05-05	Yay more whitewashing of Cersei
1695	Colonel Green	2014-05-05	It should also be noted that this entire Iron Bank story line has not been played out in the book. It could in fact be the case that the Lannister mines have ran dry in the books.


No, if that were the case, Ser Kevan would have been concerned about that, but he wasn't.
Â 
Also, the mines running dry is not something that could be kept secret.Â  There are presumably a lot of mining towns that would have noticed that.
1696	Fritz West	2014-05-05	Personally, I like the idea. Not just because it symbolizes the demolition of their house, but because it means this is the last chance the Lannisters have to keep the status quo of power. The Lannisters have always been the most powerful house because of their gold. Now that their gold is drying up this makes them a lot more desperate to win the Iron throne. They won't have the chance to wait for another dynastic dispute to gain more power. This is what will make the Lannisters and all the Lannisters (Kaven, ect.) cling more desperately to the throne. Also I feel like it adds more to the gloom and doom. Winter is coming...

Â 

Â 
Could not agree more. Â 
Â 
I think the change is needless and silly; its sort of there to let the viewer know "Hey, look- these people are in decline!" Â And this way bloggers can write and look smart. Â 
Â 
The end result is so Cersei (and the only actress they will need to put up with after this season) will appear to be more caught bewteen a "rock and a hard place" than a terrible, incompetent ruler. Â They want Cersei to appear more troubled than troubling. Â And that's weak. Â 
Â 
But, look on the bright side everyone- next week, Stannis Baratheon gets to apply for a business loan. Â What's his credit score? Â

Â 
I think it also further emphasizes the ties between the Lannisters and the Tyrells. Its not just the army, or even the food, they need the gold too. Cersei's incompetence and pissing on the alliance will be made to look all the worse, and the spider's schemes all the more plain to see for the viewer. Everyone now knows for sure the Lannisters NEED the Tyrells. Cersei is going to look like a buffoon.
1700	gawain	2014-05-05	I wasn't too excited when Tywin dropped this one on Cersei (and, consequently, on us viewers). Not because they're going off course, deviating from the books or anything like that but because it makes the Lannisters seem weak and desperate.
Â 
Nevertheless, I think the showrunners chose to stick with this idea as a result of their changing Stannis's story arc significantly.
Â 
Instead of being were he was supposed to be by now, scenes from episode 6 show that Stannis will have a face-to-face with Tycho Nestoris from the Iron Bank of Braavos and will try to win them over to his side. To me, it felt like the Tywin-Cersei scene in episode 5 was nothing but a build-up, made just so the viewers won't get lost in the narrative of the following episode. By telling everyone that the Lannisters are in the red might avoid unwanted questions such as: "Tywin should have predicted this move by Stannis. He knew the crown was in debt so why didn't he pay it with all the gold in Casterly Rock and prevent Stannis from approaching the Iron Bank?"
Â 
Well, now we know he was hard-pressed to keep his own neck above water. Personally, I think it's a bad excuse and a bad move, story-wise.

Could be the producers overlooked this. Either way, if not even Cersei knew the mines had been shut for three years, I find it difficult to believe that Robb or any other Northerner would know about the Lannisters' financial situation. I expect this information would be known only to Tywin and a handful of his counselors, like Kevan.

I disagree, it makes them look stretched thin from years of funding Robert and years of war, but I think you still get every impression that Tywin is still in control of the situation. You understand that the Iron Bank is powerful so he can't just ignore them, but that his control of the crown and alliance with the Tyrells keeps him ahead of the curve. Plus he fully expects to have the Reach and the North (or planned on it with the north) under his control through his children and eventual grandchildren. It will all go to shit for non book readers when Tywin dies and Cersei goes into full idiot paranoid mode.
1708	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	In a way Robb did get his vengeance. The Lannisters aren't dead, but he helped put the drain on their resources and thus the blood of their dynasty. If only he had lived a little longer, Tywin can ony hide the Lannisters state for so long.

Â 
I am not convinced he will get his loan next week though. I think he may get rejected (or some half measure of some kind is taken) and Nestoris still goes to the Wall later. Stannis doesn't really have any collateral and the Lannisters haven't defaulted yet. More heavy foreshadowing for whats going to happen, while giving Stannis' plot some actual movement.
Â 
So I think he gets rejected next week, but the door is left open for when he eventually gets approved.

1717	Emperoreddy	2014-05-05	I think it also plays into the idea of power and the lies the realm is held up by theme that the show has pushed.

Â 
Depends on where that storyline ends up I imagine. Tyrion won't know about the gold drying up odds are, and I don't think the rest of the world will know until the Iron Bank comes to collect, if even.
Â 
Whatever player Tyrion finally ends up behind could decide to honor the crown's debts to the Lannisters if it comes to that;

This. With everything going on in Westeros now, I think the Lannisters' gold mines are the last thing people are worried about. Plus no more income does not equal poor/broke. At least not immediately. It certainly explains why Tywin is so eager for an alliance with the Tyrell's.

The thing is the show emphasized too much the Lannister gold, without mentioning that the Reach actually have more productive resources and are quite wealthy themselves. Lannisters would be like owning 1 trillion dollars, whereas the reach is like owning the 10 largest corporations of the world.

1728	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	Honestly though, the Tyrells probably already know this and I have a feeling this will lead to Cersei and Loras not marrying.

1729	D-Shiznit	2014-05-05	This revelation does shatter the Lannister mystique a great deal, knowing that they are merely living in a house cards that is crumbling changes their identity to the viewer. No longer are they the all-powerful house that we once thought but instead one living a lie and leeching off other houses,

But what's the problem with that? If there is a constant in ASOIAF is that people is never what they seem to be.

Jaime, the handsome knight in a golden armor = asshole
Sandor, the gruesome ugly man who scares little girls = actually tries to protect one
Cersei, golden beautiful Queen = crazy as fuck.
The Lannisters, rich and powerful = broke.

I think you've oversimplified things . Especially Sandor, but also all of the other 3
1731	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	It also explains why Tywin has looked....less dominant during season 4. Something was just off about him throughout these 5 episodes, but he never came off as commanding as he was in the prevous 3 seasons. Dance is probably channeling this.

1735	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-05	I think you've oversimplified things . Especially Sandor, but also all of the other 3But that's what GRRM does: takes tropes and cliches and murders them.
1736	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-05	I disagree, strongly, I think most of what he does is more subtle than that actually
And a subverted/slaughtered trope is still a trope. Never understood the overuse of the word clichA© either
1737	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-05-05	They aren't broke, but they don't have any new money coming it. Â
1738	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-05	Not a fan of this.
Â 
I understand the need to emphasize the importance of the Iron Bank, but this seems like a short sighted way to do so. How is this not well known throughout Westoros? Does Tywin have all the goldsmiths, minters, miners, and merchants dealing in supplying said professions on some type of hush-money/welfare program? How was he supplying Robert for years with tourney purses without gold? Was Littlefinger duplicitous in Tywin's fraud?Â 
Â 
ThisÂ screams of something that will never be mentioned again however.


Â 
Â 
I agree. The fact that there was a war on, so no miners left to mine much (went to war, died) plus the Young Wolf's foragers raiding their mines and caving them in would have made a good enough explanation for why House Lannister would run dry of gold for at least a few years.Â 
Â 
[spoiler]Also, Cersei being told the importance of the Iron Bank, and seeming to understand it, undermines the plot point that later she tells them to go fuck themselves.[/spolier]
Â 
Perhaps since Stannis has earlier-than-we-expected plans regarding the IB, we're going to see some clash there, sooner rather than later?

No, Tyrion mentioned this when he became Master of Coin, Littlefinger definitely had a hand in it.
1740	Petyr Patter	2014-05-05	The idea of the Lannisters being broke has been discussed before in the books.
Â 
Here was my take on it: http://asoiaf.wester...roke/?p=4723471 , along with the rest of thread, obviously.
Â 
I like the theory as evidence that the Lannisters were empty despite their many efforts to look rich and powerful.Â  However, the textual evidence just isn't there.
Â 
Really, my take home lesson here was the Iron Bank is going to have a huge role in the coming novels.Â
1741	Bannerman_Forrester	2014-05-05	People seem to be freaking out acting like the gold mines are their only source of money making. It's the main source of their wealth but they still have farms, ports, lumber, and other stuff for trade. The mines were RUMORED to produce gold even in the current time line, so they were bound to dry up sooner or later giving it's been mined since the Age of Heroes.Â 

					
					
							Edited by Bannerman_Forrester, 05 May 2014 - 03:18 AM.
1742	Hippocras	2014-05-05	My take on this is quite different from what many people here are saying.
I think it may not be a change from the books, but rather a spoiler. We know the show this season is moving into territory not yet covered by the books. But if you think about it, a lot of things that have been happening in the books make a bit more sense if this is in fact true and the Lannisters are almost out of gold. Each mine would know their own remaining supply, but may not know the state of the rest of the mines. The Lord of Casterly Rock and its castelan would be the only ones who have an overview.
If the Lannisters are out of gold, it gives depth to the actions of both Cersei and Tyrion. If Cersei knows there is no Lannister gold it means she is perhaps not quite as much of an idiot as everyone assumed when she flatly refused to pay back the Iron Bank: she simply had no way to do so. It also means that Tyrion's gamble when he joined the Second Sons is loaded with sneakiness. He gave away all the gold of Casterly Rock to Brown Ben Plumm and his captains, knowing full well that there was no gold to give.

1743	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	I have a question.
Â 
How Is Tywin's 1000 year dynasty gonna bloom if House Lannister's resources are being drained? Did he even think of this?
1744	Bannerman_Forrester	2014-05-05	Maybe he plans to crap the gold out?

Â

Well it might in the end be why he was so hungry for the throne. If he knows he is running out of gold then decline is inevitable unless his family climbs instead. With political power, you can spend someone else's money.
1746	Ran	2014-05-05	Hippocras,
Â 
Kevan's epilogue in ADwD makes it fairly plain that Casterly Rock still has plenty of gold. The richness of the mines are a detail Tyrion brings up more than once, and he's resided at the Rock (and worked in and around it) longer than either of his siblings, and so you suppose he'd know.
Â 
It's an invention of the show.
1747	King Zee	2014-05-05	I think the show overdid it by saying the mines are already exhausted. I would have preferred if Tywin had said that production was declining and likely to cease in 3 years.
Â 
You get the same idea - time is running out without breaking with the books too much, where the mines are clearly still going.Â

Ok, thanks for jogging my memory. Still, even if there is still gold at this point in the books, it doesn't mean that status won't change soon enough.
1749	Maia	2014-05-05	Hippocras,Â Kevan's epilogue in ADwD makes it fairly plain that Casterly Rock still has plenty of gold.Indeed. not to mention that Robb's forces plundered a few mines not belonging directly to the Lannisters and there was gold in those mines, too. I mean, people don't just let their gold reserves sit in a mine - they are periodically transported to vaults inside defensible fortresses, etc.Besides, book Tywin probably wouldn't have acted like he did, confidently going it alone against the whole realm, if he had shortage of money.And what is show Tywin thinking of, letting the "king's men" such as Polliver continue their robbing of the populace? Shouldn't he be even more interested than book Tywin (who was ahead of him there) in re-establishing the peace and production in the Riverlands?IMHO, the show-runners are laying it on way too thick. Yes, Lannisters are going to crumble from inside, but in the books it was despite their riches, not because they were running out. And that was far more interesting, IMHO. Show already had that theme with Xaro and Littlefinger, this is downright repetitive now.
1750	lokisnow	2014-05-05	well Tywin's been aware of this for ages and has been tightly managing the supply of gold into circulation to keep the value of the shiny metal high. Highly productive mines pumping out new gold would just steadily depress the value of his reserves.But what I immediately thought of was this, what exactly were the terms that Tyrion offered in DWD? because if he offered all the gold of a CR gold mine for a year, hah, he just offered them nothing to support him. :-p

Â 
Tywin Lannister loaned 3 million dragons to the throne.Â  Tyrion, if Martin communicated effectively and I did the math right, offered the Second Sons 150,000 gold dragons (plus lands and a keep to Brown Ben).Â  A better way to see this difference:
Â 
150,000
3,000,000
Â 
Eddard Stark, who is no Hot Pie, believed 3,000,000 to be a fortune of incredible magnitude.Â  I just can't believe a House that can loan out that kind of money is in any dangerous financial straits.Â
1752	Lord Varys	2014-05-05	What?! The Lannisters are now broke?! That one really had me almost pissing myself during a very healthy laugh! I really can't take this show seriously anymore.
Â 
This is Westeros, and even in the real world you can fool your wife and family only for a short period of time when you have lost your job and still leave the house at the same time in the morning. Money and gold are real things, and people in the Westerlands and at KL would know if Tywin was broke. Those are gold mines, people do work there, and they TALK!
Â 
On the other hand: Sansa and Littlefinger entering the Vale through THE BLOODY GATE when coming by ship is almost as ridiculous. What did they do? Take a detour on the High Road to hang around with the clansmen?!
1753	hollowcrown	2014-05-05	well Tywin's been aware of this for ages and has been tightly managing the supply of gold into circulation to keep the value of the shiny metal high. Highly productive mines pumping out new gold would just steadily depress the value of his reserves.

Â 
This is pretty realistic. The gold may have run out but Tywin is still controlling its refinement and supply to keep its value high.
1754	Ran	2014-05-05	Guys, the show made this bit up. It's not a book thing. Tyrion knows just as well as Kevan and Tywin knows in the novels that Casterly Rock's mines are just fine.

1755	salmonsnake	2014-05-05	If I understand correctly what they wanted to convey with that piece of information, it'd been perhaps more optimal to refer to the loans LF took from the IBOB in conjunction with the size of their army when compared to that of the Tyrells. Would have tied up the incoming downfall of the 'steward house' quite nicely with the reason they need the Tyrells, as well as LF's scheming and also Dany's decision to stay in Meereen. Then there would have been no need to invent this thing
1756	voodooqueen126	2014-05-05	IMHO, the show-runners are laying it on way too thick.

This. So much.
There are countries that are rolling in gold, diamonds and oil, and yet are horrifically poor. Not because they lack resources but because they have corrupt, unstable governments.
The Book Lannister's are the same: well run they were prosperous, but the weakness and instability of their rulers destroys them.
1757	NomadicDirewolf	2014-05-05	not sure about this change, it seems like something that would be kind of a cool revelation if it were in the books, but it also seems like a reasonably big thing for the show to just invent. Still, I suppose it helps explain why the iron bank arent getting paid back out of tywins own pocket, as surely (at least if everyone was aware of the problem of the iron bank as they are in the show) it would represent a good investment on tywins part to continue the crowns loan repayments out of his own pocket, in order to avoid another war and keep his family on the throne. Also, by the point we're up to now in the books we're hearing that the lannisters have started to run into financial trouble through all the money they've spent on the wars and other stuff, so the gold running out ultimately leads to the same situation that we have in the books right now anyway, so I guess, unless they take it any further to make stuff happen that doesnt in the books, which i doubt they will do, this change doesnt really matter in the grand scheme of things. There are bigger changes out there I have more of a problem with.Â
1758	Lord Varys	2014-05-05	This thing is really priceless, guys. It should enable pretty much anyone to see that the TV show is pretty much nothing but glorified (bad) fan fiction. It's not an adaptation anymore, it's loosely based on/inspired by the works of GRRM, and should be treated as such. I for one are done with comparing this thing to the actual books.
Â 
I'm even surprised now if stuff from the books is brought up unexpectedly - like Sunspear, the Water Gardens, or Oberyn's daughters. I don't expect stuff like that in this thing anymore.
1759	Batman	2014-05-05	I do not dig this change at all. I understand, as has been pointed out, that it seems to be done so that Cersei is not outright stupid in refusing to pay the debts. What is the world coming to when even Cersei cant be stupid? You need to mitigate that too? I don't know why but that change really brought me down on the episode as a whole. I understand at this point they are changing a lot of stuff, but this one really hit me.Â
1760	Lord Varys	2014-05-05	Oh, and by the way: This temple analogy was also crap. People are people, and people can be killed. There should be good bankers as well as incompetent bankers with the Iron Bank. Killing a good CEO and replacing him with a moron would make a difference (or replacing a good board of directors with a group of idiots).
Â 
The theme of the downfall of House Lannister - or the history of House Lannister (hello Damon, Tyland, Jason, Tytos) - completely relies on the fact that it was only Tywin who enabled the Lannisters to transform their natural resources into political power. Cersei, Jaime, and even Kevan can't do that. They are either too stupid or not competent enough. Money is not everything. But without money the Lannisters would be nothing. Saying 'I'm rich' doesn't make you rich (I've tried), and a man like Tywin would have lost everything in the very moment it became evident that the mines are empty. He would have been ridiculed. And he would not have been able to project an image of strength from the - we are talking about real gold here. Tywin is not the Madoff guy fooling stupid rich people, it's a man who mines actual gold from actual mines in a society where you can invest into/buy actual goods. Not stuff on paper.
Â 
Can anyone really take this show seriously after this episode? I really can't. I can't even try anymore. It's simply too much.
1761	Lord Damian	2014-05-05	It is not surprising to me as I predicted that Tyrion, at the end of the series will survive, get Casterly Rock only to find out the mines have been dry which means the gold is (by the time we arrive there) all but dried up too. Tyrion will just sit back, laugh and demmand wine.
1762	Lord Damian	2014-05-05	The Lannisters cannot let this cat out of the bag as it will diminish their power if the other houses know that the 7-8 thousand years of gold pumping prosperity out of the Rock has dried up. Oh well, they still have Lannisport. Also, this stresses the fact that they need the tyrells more than ever.
1763	Duckface	2014-05-05	Oh, and by the way: This temple analogy was also crap. People are people, and people can be killed.

I was blown away with the Cersei cozy up to Margeary. She hates her from the begginning. Also, her dissing on Joff like that. Joff was her pride and Joy, could do no wrong. The worse thing book Cersei ever says about Joff was that he was "willfull". Whitewashing of Cersei is quite dissapointing as she was just as evil as Joff.

but has the show ever completely disagreed with something in the books before? tweaking and event or fact is one thing but doesn't saying the mines are dry when they're not create a major deviation that changes the actual story?
1766	Ran	2014-05-05	Probably not, since the problems Cersei encounters with the Iron Bank are there despite Casterly Rock having all that wealth. She's not going to beggar herself, personally, to deal with the Iron Bank when (she figures) she can just tell them to go suck eggs. They're simply giving Cersei the "better" motivation of not genuinely having the wherewithal to deal with it.
1767	Fevre River Warrior	2014-05-05	I wonder if D&D know how the story will evolve and perhaps the Lannisters will find their mines dried up....in the future. There still is a lot of story to be told in the books.
Â 
I agree that the show has made Cersei too soft. The book Cersei is just horrible, which is where Joffrey got his horribleness, but the show has really "whitewashed" her as you say. I loathe the book Cersei and hope both book and HBO Cersei meets a brutal, long drawn out and painful death then the time comes. I don't see the HBO Cersei taking the Walk of Shame, which is unfortunate. I really felt she deserved it in the book.
Â 
I am looking forward to the Iron BankÂ  playing a larger role in the books and HBO show.
1768	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-05	Please accept my bitter tears of anguish at this fan fiction.

In other news, I'm glad they're emphasising the importance of the Iron Bank.

That thing is so obviously an invention by D&D to make their version of the Iron Bank story work. And it's completely pointless. Just as their 'Bran will seek shelter at Craster's'-idea or their 'Mance does not know anything of the true strength of the NW'-stupidity are completely pointless.

Â 
POV's that get waaay too many chapters (Im looking at you Brienne...and Asha....and Danaerys....and Tyrion and oh you get the point). Storylines that go on too long (when the hell is Dany going to Westeros? When is Robin gonna frickin die?). Prose is good but used overly much.
Â 
For gods sake, some people here make me ashamed to be a fan of the books. Can't you appreciate both as separate entities?

Yes Brienne is loyal to a fault and it's exhausting keeping those vows, yes Cersei is a terrible ruler, paranoid and poisonous, WE GET IT. You can't honestly tell me the books needed THAT many chapters to get the point across.

1797	Mr Fixit	2014-05-05	Well, colour me surprised. I have no problem believing that the Throne is practically bankrupt and unable to repay its debts, but the revelation about the Lannister gold is... a bit hard to swallow. Every single mine in the country can't run out at practically the same time and without anyone knowing, can it? It's as if Saudi Arabia came out and admitted that it had stopped producing oil last year.Â 
Â 
Frankly, there are a bunch of logical reasons why Tywin can't or won't repay the IT's debts to the Iron Bank, especially when we take into account that those debts had nothing to do with him in the first place. I can come up with several points:
Wartime expenses - Raising, equipping, and maintaining a 60,000-strong army for several years must be enormously expensive, even for Tywin.
Robb's raidingÂ - The Young Wolf spent months raiding up and down the Westerlands, seizing gold mines, possibly making them inoperable for the time being.
Where are my taxes!?!Â - I can easily imagine that only the Crownlands and the Westerlands have been paying their taxes to the Iron Throne. The Reach has probably resumed its payments in the meantime, as well as the Stormlands. The North, Riverlands, Iron Islands, Vale, Dorne probably paid nothing or next to nothing.
Taking all this into account it's not hard to believe that even with the Lannister gold, the Throne is simply unable to fulfill its obligations, at least in the short- or mid-term, until the country recovers from war.

1798	melfinastar	2014-05-05	Â 
So, it resulted that Tywin Lannister wasn't in the privy because he was poisoned after all. He was only trying to get the gold to pay his debts.


Â lol That's perfect!
1799	AzureOwl	2014-05-05	"the Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources"
Â 
"our last working mine ran dry two years ago"
Â 
Â 
how does that make any sense?


Â 
Tywin was very specific about the mines having run dry. But I really doubt that the Lannisters spent every last ounce of gold that came out of the ground. Keeping a tight control on the gold supply is the best way to keep it's value high. The Lannisters on the show must have several years worth of reserves at Casterly Rock. But with the mines extinguished they can't keep releasing the same amount of gold into the market and finance the war, and pardon the debt the crown owes them, and pay the Iron Bank.
Â 
Those reserves must've been already been depleted enough by lending Robert money.
1800	Maia	2014-05-05	Money is not everything. But without money the Lannisters would be nothing. Saying 'I'm rich' doesn't make you rich (I've tried), and a man like Tywin would have lost everything in the very moment it became evident that the mines are empty. He would have been ridiculed.Well, I am sure that Lannisters have other sources of income. For one, they are acting like a primitive bank themselves, loaning money for interest. Lannisport is the third-biggest city in Westeros and famous for it's jewelers and metalworkers, it should bring in nice taxes. They have abundant fishing, and while not as fertile as the Reach or the Riverlands, the West is still ahead of the North or Dorne as far as agrarian produce is concerned.In fact, it is not impossible that Lannister incomes from the afore-mentioned activities are much greater than what they get from the mines, but Tywin preferred to stress their mineral wealth because that other stuff, and usury in particular, made him look like a merchant.OTOH, gold from the mines provided a nice war-time cushion for the book Lannisters, when all their other lines of income were disrupted.The show making Lannisters short on liquidity - which seems to be the implication from Tywin's dialog with Cersei, not only uses the very same ploy for the _third_ time, but presents Tywin as a moron, because he is not restoring the peace and productivity of the realm ASAP, like he was doing in the books with the pardons to the Riverlords and sending out Tarly et al. to restore order.If interest on the crown loans has become a major source of income for him (unlike in the books), then what is he doing, allowing the scum like Polliver et al. to interfere with restoration of the peace and flow of taxes?And how stupid was it, to invest in the exorbitant credit to the crown, exclusively?As opposed to the books, where said credit was not primarily a financial investment, but bid for political power, that Tywin could afford to not see any return on for years or even lose entirely.I have never understood the love for show Tywin - Dance is a good actor, but his lines constantly presented Tywin as a blowhard, who wastes his time berating and denigrating everybody, but is pretty dumb himself.At no time did it look in the show as if he could actually succeed at pacifying and rebuilding the realm. They practically signposted that his ambitions were doomed back in the season 3.Now, finally, _in season 4_ we got some small inklings that Tywin might be a somewhat capable statesman, only to have it all demolished with this new "revelation".Makes the majority of Westeros pretty doomed in the show too, come winter, now that I think of it. I have always supposed that whoever wins is going to use Lannister money to pay off the foreign creditors and buy food.Now, as far as the show is concerned, they can only go much further into foreign debt (Stannis!), which is going to completely cripple any eventual rebuilding, or just let all these pesky northeners, Riverlanders and crownlanders die off from starvation.
1801	Job Snow	2014-05-05	I find it slightly ridiculous how everybody is acting that having no more working mines means the Lannisters will be completely powerless in no time. Given that most westerosi lords have no mines at all, I wonder how they even manage to raise the tiniest levy if mines are so important. Besides, it is not like the Westerlands are completely empty and barren outside of the mines. They seem pretty fertile to me all in all.
I would say the gold mines are just an added bonus, but income from lands alone should give the Lannisters equal income to say the Vale or the Riverlands. Without mining income they would definitely loose some weight to throw around, but no way that they would be powerless.
1802	David Selig	2014-05-05	I am amazed that the show manages to be even worse about anything money related than the books. Whenever they mention anything money related, it never makes the slightest bit of sense.

He is much nicer person for sure, but as a fictional character he is an epic bore.
1806	jarl the climber	2014-05-05	Just because the gold mines dried up, doesn't mean the Lannisters are broke. Tywin is thinking big picture, but I'm sure they probably have a large gold reserve and are actively collecting on debts owed to them by several parties (including the Crown). Three years is about the time frame of the show, so it's interesting that when all heck breaks loose, Tywin decides to get involved in continental politics after his self-imposed exile. Perhaps he saw the writing on the wall and had spent the past 17/19 years investing/organizing/managing the dwindling mines in order to keep the Westerlands profitable.
Â 
Plus, with the war on, people might not bat an eye if the Westerlands cease minting for a while and instead fortify their borders and plump up their armies instead. I'm sure it's an open secret that some of the gold mines have dried up, but only Tywin and his closest financial advisors would know the full scope of what's going on financially at Casterly Rock.


Personally I'm not sure if Tywin is being completely truthful with Cersei. He wants her to go through with the marriages and is saying to her that she can't look for help from him, the mines have failed and we need the Tyrells, so you will marry Loras and that's it. Maybe the mines are declining and its a problem, I don't think the Lannisters control all of the gold mines in the West anyways, so it didn't make sense the way it was presented to us. Still, I have some doubts about Tywin being 100% truthful in this instance, he has lots of reasons to be lying.

TV!Tyrion is much more likable than Book!Tyrion, he has had all those nasty bits of moral ambiguity washed away, he is genuinely concerned for his child bride and tries to save his true love Shae, is honoring his sham of a marriage, trying to cure cancer and still retains his rapier wit all while trying to save the realm and please his father.
Â 
I think they just should have renamed him, since he is a completely different character than in the book. Instead of Tyrion, he shall be called Tyrone, Patron Saint of cripples, bastards and broken things.
1809	boojam	2014-05-05	It's a fairly silly turn, in the sense that no, it's not thought out, much as their turn with Xaro's "wealthiest man in Qarth is in fact bankrupt" thing -- both raise the same questions. You'd think someone whose father was a banking executive might have at least a little more respect for the fundamentals of economics... or maybe not, I guess, after the bailouts? Â But in any case, I think it's fairly obvious that the change is there to mitigate Cersei still further. She's not going to tell the Iron Bank she won't pay up because she's recklessly arrogant on the topic... but because she'll have no choice. Boo-hoo. Â (Yeah, not a fan of the whitewash. She's such a bland character.)Tywin said last mine ran dry (can't start any new mines?) , but he didn't say the treasury of Lannisters was bankrupt. Seems like it was about to red line, and he wanted the House Tyrell to ease the burden.Funny to think The Iron Bank of Braavos is making the houses of Westeros 'Too Big to Fail'!Even more reason for Tywin to get rid of Joffrey , if 'ol Joff spoiled things with the Tyrell's then chapter 11!I love it!Money talks, losers walk.
1810	fangirl000	2014-05-05	Yes, the Lanister power without foundations is a nice turn. I also like the idea that they are emphasising the danger in not paying the Iron Bank. I always thought that it needed to be further mentioned in the Books.


Â 
Maybe they're trying make Cersei's eventual decision to NOT respect the Iron Bank in the future look like less of a power trip and more of a necessity? Â There's a vast difference between "Screw the bank, I'm in charge!," and "Well, it's not like I have the money to pay them anyway..." Â For expediency, I can see the writers cutting the whole subplot about her rebuilding the navy and having it from under her.
Â 
Edit to add:



Â 
This is also a good point.
Â 
Makes Cersei's Fuck You to the IB much less a matter of "A Queen can do as she wills" and more a matterÂ of "Woe is the women left to deal with the debts of her inept husband and lying father."

The Lannisters aren't broke..........yet. But they will be if they keep lending money to the crown. They still have their own resources for the moment but the belt-tightening is about to begin and someone else needs to start paying the crown's debts, at least till the Lannisters can find another source of money.


Â 
Yeah, Tywin never said they were broke.

1814	Ser Lepus	2014-05-05	My take on this is quite different from what many people here are saying.
I think it may not be a change from the books, but rather a spoiler. We know the show this season is moving into territory not yet covered by the books. But if you think about it, a lot of things that have been happening in the books make a bit more sense if this is in fact true and the Lannisters are almost out of gold. Each mine would know their own remaining supply, but may not know the state of the rest of the mines. The Lord of Casterly Rock and its castelan would be the only ones who have an overview.
If the Lannisters are out of gold, it gives depth to the actions of both Cersei and Tyrion. If Cersei knows there is no Lannister gold it means she is perhaps not quite as much of an idiot as everyone assumed when she flatly refused to pay back the Iron Bank: she simply had no way to do so. It also means that Tyrion's gamble when he joined the Second Sons is loaded with sneakiness. He gave away all the gold of Casterly Rock to Brown Ben Plumm and his captains, knowing full well that there was no gold to give.

Problem is, we have read both Cersei's and Kevan's thoughts while thinking about money and debts, and none of them thinks that the main source of income of Casterly Rock has dried up.
Â 

Hippocras,
Kevan's epilogue in ADwD makes it fairly plain that Casterly Rock still has plenty of gold. The richness of the mines are a detail Tyrion brings up more than once, and he's resided at the Rock (and worked in and around it) longer than either of his siblings, and so you suppose he'd know.
It's an invention of the show.

What Ran said.

1815	Seneti	2014-05-05	Â Exactly, running a government isn't the same as running a personal account. You can run a government on a deficit, it just isn't sustainable, especially if the people decide to collect at once (which is exactly what will happen).


Â 
Even with a personal account it's not that bad. You can end up without a source of income (read: unemployed) and still have millions of dollars in savings. Does that make you poor or broke? No. It just means your source of income is gone and you have to start watching your expenses and your budget.
Â 


The thing is the show emphasized too much the Lannister gold, without mentioning that the Reach actually have more productive resources and are quite wealthy themselves. Lannisters would be like owning 1 trillion dollars, whereas the reach is like owning the 10 largest corporations of the world.


Â 
Actually, we did get that conversation between Olenna and Tyrion where Olenna explained just how much they contributed to the war efforts (money, soldiers, horses, provisions) and we knowÂ that they payed half of the wedding costs, so I think by now viewers know that Tyrells are very wealthy.
Â 


Removing Littlefingers role in the Iron Bank fiasco by deliberately taking out loans from them en mass was rather disappointing. Hes been purposefully fucking the realm. Hopefully the show addresses it later.


Â 
Except they didn't remove his role. It was clearly pointed out by Tyrion when he became Master of Coin that Littlefinger was drawing the money for RObert's expenses from two sources: Tywin (bad) and the Iron Bank (really fucking bad).
Â 


My take on this is quite different from what many people here are saying.

Â 
Agreed.
Â 


I was blown away with the Cersei cozy up to Margeary. She hates her from the begginning. Also, her dissing on Joff like that. Joff was her pride and Joy, could do no wrong. The worse thing book Cersei ever says about Joff was that he was "willfull". Whitewashing of Cersei is quite dissapointing as she was just as evil as Joff.


Â 
Why does everybody take whatever Cersei says at face value? I mean, every word she says just screams "lie". She was as much sympathising with Margaery as she was being nice to Sansa in season 1. It's an act, a deliberate attempt to make Margaery say something that she can use to cast her down.
Â 


The butthurt, my god.


Â 
I hear ya...
Â

Did it ever even say that they were completely broke? Â  Just because the mines are dry, doesn't mean that they don't have gold.Â

Exactly.Â

If they didn't, well, interesting touch I guess, but repetitive, given that they did the same thing in season 2. But it doesn't make much sense that nobody knows about it. There should be hundreds if not thousands of workers in the mines. I am sure somebody would have noticed that they stopped working 3 years ago.

It could mean that in 20 years their gold supply will be completely diminished, but it does mean they don't have the resources to pay back the Iron Bank in full, which is why Tywin needs the Tyrells on his side.
Â 
I don't like or dislike the change.Â

Why do people talk as if the books are leagues better than the show? The books have PLENTY of flaws.
Â 
POV's that get waaay too many chapters (Im looking at you Brienne...and Asha....and Danaerys....and Tyrion and oh you get the point). Storylines that go on too long (when the hell is Dany going to Westeros? When is Robin gonna frickin die?). Prose is good but used overly much.
Â 
For gods sake, some people here make me ashamed to be a fan of the books. Can't you appreciate both as separate entities?


Â 
Are you really willing to argue that the show is better or on the same narrative level as the books? Really?

Can we write white wash and character assassination some more in this thread please? And agency. That's a new one I like. Agency.
The white washing of character A is total character assassination and leaves them with zero agency.
I like that. Feel free to copy and paste it into every thread it will save you more time to cry bitter tears about GOT unbelievebly not being just the text from the novels slowly scrolling Star Wars style up the TV screen.


Â 
Do you dispute that changes to the characterization of several characters(Tyrion and CerseiÂ in particular) has presented them in a significantly more sympathetic light? Do you disagree that Stannis has been portrayed in as darker than the average fan saw him pre-show? Do you find the claims that Sansa seemed to have no active role in her escape, or even her plan for escape, to have no merit?
Â 
More importantly, can youÂ craft a reasonable argument against these thoughts? Or is holier than thou sarcasm all we can expect?
1820	Wmarshal	2014-05-05	The show and are no longer close to being the same, it ended with this, and the Tyrells, you know the guys who produceÂ nearly all the foodÂ goods which would require a lot of smallfolk thus producing a lot of soldiers, have the least amount of warriors.
1821	W1NT3RF3LL	2014-05-05	I guess I don't see how this change helps the TV show...it will make Cersei turning on the Tyrells suicidally insane...whereas in the book, it's extremely stupid to alienate them, but I don't think book Cersei would trash the alliance if she knew her family was really broke.what part in the book made her look smart at all? As far as im concerned I have always seen cersei as a character who just wants power. In my opinion she just doesnt care of repercussions or any of such and is a huge risk taker.  I dont even believe she cares about the lannister dynasty.  She really just wants to be king and rule.  At the end of the day it would not be far fetched if she still tells the IB to piss off in the show as that is something she would do anyways. Show or book.  For some odd reason people feel she has gone soft this pass episode, but if you have seen her character and know who is you would know she is simply scheming to get others on her side for the trial and to sympathize.  Its clear as day.
1822	bent branch	2014-05-05	I can't believe the people who are arguing that the mines drying up doesn't mean the Lannisters are in dire financial straights when TV!Tywin tells Cersei that they are in financial difficulties because the mines have dried up. Come on, this is not a show vs. book argument you're trying to make. Your argument is saying the show is internally inconsistent, whether you realize it or not.
Â 
As to whether this change was necessary or even made sense in the show context we need to think about what they have already established in the show about what the Tyrells and Lannisters each bring to the table. During season 2, King's Landing was experiencing a food shortage almost to the level of a famine. Why was there this food shortage? It was because the Tyrells had stopped shipments of food. If the Westerlands were a good food producing area, all the Lannisters would have had to do was break the blockade around KL and bring in food from the Westerlands. But the Westerlands are a hilly/mountainous area that has little more food production capacity than can feed their own area. Also, with the Reach being a food producing region they have a large population and, thus, can muster large armies. It is these two characteristics that make the Reach a good ally for the Westerlands. This is established in show in season 2. So it is internally inconsistent in the show for the Lannisters to now need to ally with the Tyrells for the money.

Â 
In agrarian feudal society, having a large population and plentiful arable land directly leads to having lots of money and/or other taxable resources.

Your point? The question isn't that the Tyrells are wealthy. They obviously are. My point is that the Tyrells have resources that the Lannisters don't and the show has already established this point in a past season.

Â 
Yes, of course. You could say that since the war is pretty much over and regular lines of trade/communications established, it's the money, not armies or food, that's of greater interest to the Iron Throne. Anyway, I already said that I also think that the reveal about the mines is pretty stupid.

1827	MoA«t	2014-05-05	Perhaps Tywin is lying to control Cersei.Â

If she thinks the mines are dry, she's less likely to piss off anyone Tywin still wants to manipulate, i.e. the Tyrells.

Thank you. This.
1829	lostinwesteros	2014-05-05	Tywin said last mine ran dry (can't start any new mines?) , but he didn't say the treasury of Lannisters was bankrupt. Seems like it was about to red line, and he wanted the House Tyrell to ease the burden.Funny to think The Iron Bank of Braavos is making the houses of Westeros 'Too Big to Fail'!Even more reason for Tywin to get rid of Joffrey , if 'ol Joff spoiled things with the Tyrell's then chapter 11!I love it!Money talks, losers walk.

It would be such a nice touch, though, if the Lannisters were really bankrupt and, when it's all said and done, cannot pay their debts, after all.  ; }
1830	JDNight	2014-05-05	Not a fan of this.
Â 
I understand the need to emphasize the importance of the Iron Bank, but this seems like a short sighted way to do so. How is this not well known throughout Westoros? Does Tywin have all the goldsmiths, minters, miners, and merchants dealing in supplying said professions on some type of hush-money/welfare program? How was he supplying Robert for years with tourney purses without gold? Was Littlefinger duplicitous in Tywin's fraud?Â 
Â 
ThisÂ screams of something that will never be mentioned again however.


Â 
Â 
I agree 100%.Â  How could this remain a secret?!?Â  This seems odd to me.Â  However, if it was somehow kept a secret from most people, much of what LF has done up to now can be explained very well.
Â 
1)Â  He sees that the Lannisters and the Crown are going to go broke.
2)Â  He sees winter coming.
3)Â  He realizes that Kingslanding is NOT the place to be.
4)Â  He decides the Aerie looks like a really good place to hole up for the winter.
5)Â  Set about making this happen...Â Â  Killing lord Arryn.
6)Â  Creates the chaos needed to make certain that no other lord can be a threat to him.
7)Â  Sits real pretty in the Aerie through the winter.
Â 
Although I think if he had his choice, he would be there with Cat.
Â 
Just a wild hypothesis.Â  Very wild.
Â 
Oh, and I think LF helped kill Joff to get revenge for Joff killing Cat.Â  Just my opinion.

Â 
Well, they wouldn't be completely broke. They may not find enough to take back what they're owed, but for an apparently global, superpower-like bank, what they're owed isn't the point. Sending the message that you can't fuck with them, is.

Â 
True that, true that. And I guess it's better to get some of your money back than nothing at all. Now I have this mental image of the Iron Bank just salivating thinking about the Lannister gold mines just to find them empty...and really, why not? Everyone else in the series has it bad, why should things go easy for some bankers, of all people?
1836	Belisarius09	2014-05-06	This isn't the case in the books.Â  We know the mines are still pumping out gold like its nobodies business because Robb secures a few mines when he's raiding the Westerlands and they comment on it.Â  The only mines that have failed are those belonging to the Crag.Â 
Â 
So, for the show, even if the mines under casterly rock(all the mines in all of westeros, or just the casterly rock mines??) have failed, they still have the immense profits from all the trade going through Lannisport.Â 
Â 
So
1. Dumb change, that didn;t need to happen, we will see Lannister power erode in other ways
2. Doesn't even do a good job of showing Lannister's running out of money, because they still have a huge secondary source of revenues.Â

1839	DrownedSnow	2014-05-06	I just thought of something about this.

Â 
Â 
The Crown owes those monies, so the Baratheons. I do think this move is partly to help Cersei be more likable for some reason, like the BS they've done to Shae. Mostly though, I think they just wanted to answer a question viewers would have before they could ask it. Why wouldn't the Lannisters pay off all of the debt the crown has if they have an endless supply of gold? Never mind the fact that Robert somehow borrowed millions of gold dragons even though he couldn't possibly spend that much and that number just plain may not be realistic to even exist. The Lannister debt is one thing because Joff and Tommen are essentially Lannisters so it would never be an issue and isn't urgently needed to be forgiven. Tywin/Cersei could manage to pay off Bravos or at least start to make significant payments if needed.
Â 
Cersei was being all crazy and I guess they painted it as her not knowing how much trouble the Iron Bank could cause but it was still hard to believe she didn't prefer to pay that problem off instead of making a new enemy when she couldn't afford it. The one thing she seems to actually care for are her children and I would think she could give all the gold in Casterly Rock to help them. Some limit to their wealth does make sense. Cersei is terrible with problems she can't sleep with or buy off.
1840	Mr Hodor	2014-05-06	Was re-reading Dance with the dragons, and Kevan Lannister wanted to pay off the Iron bank debt with Lannister Gold. Kevan is not someone who is delusional about the current state of affairs so i am not sure if this is where the books are too.
1841	Pliskin	2014-05-06	But in any case, I think it's fairly obvious that the change is there to mitigate Cersei still further. She's not going to tell the Iron Bank she won't pay up because she's recklessly arrogant on the topic... but because she'll have no choice. Boo-hoo. 


And that actually leads to a big inconsistency problem in the story.
The logic of the Iron Bank (if a king won't pay, we'll support another one) wouldn't work in the show.
In the novels, Cersei doesn't want to pay because of her stupidity, and therefore the Iron Bank turns to Stannis, who can pay (if he becomes king) because the crown can afford to pay; he justs needs to erase the debt to the Lannisters for example or just steal from them, they lost the war after all (in the scenario in which Stannis wins).
But here, in the show, Stannis has nowhere to find money to pay the Iron Bank. So what's the point in supporting him ?
Â 
I haven't read the whole thread, so sorry if this was already pointed out.

1842	Roose Boltons Pet Leech	2014-05-06	Theory: Tywin's lying.
Â 
He doesn't trust Cersei not to get extravagant buying off people against Tyrion, and wants the Tyrells to weaken themselves financially by forking out a disproportionate share of the festivities and rebuild.
Â 
If the Westerlands is running dry of gold, the two obvious points are the already mentioned "why didn't anyone know about it (including Tyrion, who is reasonably perceptive)", and "why didn't they do some more prospecting?" Also, it's been three years since the last mine ran dry, the decline has been going on for some time. In which case, Tywin is an idiot for lending money he knew he didn't have. Â

1843	salmonsnake	2014-05-06	In which case, Tywin is an idiot for lending money he knew he didn't have.

It was started by Little Finger when he was Master of Coin. The show established this long ago, back when Tyrion took over as Master of Coin and studied the records he fetched from LF's brothel. The show hasn't established who took over as Master of Coin after Tyrion (I don't think Gyles Rosby has even been mentioned on the show), but even if Tywin personally took care of the additional tasks, I don't think it's likely that he was borrowing more money. (But he wasn't paying back either)

Edit: actually just rewatched and that particular episode says it is from Tywin the crown has borrowed millions.

Â 
But....
Â 
Its a very inelegant way of going about it. There is no way the hundreds or even thousands of workers in the mining industry have kept quiet about this.
Â 
I feel a much better way would have been to say, "the war and he raids by Robb Stark halted our gold production and now the mines are flooded. It will be 3 years before we can even start production again." This makes sense. If you don't have pumps, you don't have a mine... and the extreme rain of the autumn in Book Canon justifies the time frame. The lack of production justifies the need of the Tyrell alliance and sets up the problems with the IBB.

1846	acosta	2014-05-06	Every mine runs dry eventually. It can't be the basis of a thousand year dynasty plan anyway. Every other major house does fine without sitting on top of a gold mine. They are other ways of generating wealth in the world. 
That said, I'm pretty sure their mines are not dry in the books, but I can hardly see why it even matters. They're getting crushed anyway. Tywin and Kevan are dead. Robb's army likely killed many of their cadets. Jaime is heading off to a hang man, Cersei is on trial, and Tyrion has basically resolved to try and destroy what is left and take it for himself. 
The show is just injecting this to try and give a more convincing reason than hardheadedness that Tywin never helps the throne pay its other debts once the entire royal line becomes just his own family.

It does when the Iron Bank hasn't been paid for 4 years. It justifies having to deal with the IBB and having to renegotiate the loan. The IBB plays hardball then they are up the creek without a paddle.
1848	Roose Boltons Pet Leech	2014-05-06	Yes, but if the gold supply had been running out, it'd have been a gradual long-term process, a process Tywin would have had to deal with, and which everyone else would know about. Mines don't suddenly go from healthy capacity to nothing overnight, unless there's war, disaster, or Margaret Thatcher involved. Â

Actually all the books really say is that the Umbars have taken the mines,
I don't imagine they left them functioning when they pulled out
We also know that his army drove significant herds of cattle back with themÂ 
Â 
It very much looks like Rob's campaign in the West would have closely mirrored the MountainsÂ ChevaucheeÂ Â in the Riverlands, it's just that we never get a POV of it to see the damage, but it's clear from the bits we get that the remaining Lannister forces in the west pulled back behind fortified walls and Rob's forces battered everything else,
Â 
Ergo the Lannister Tax base has been as thoroughly destroyed as Â that of the Riverlands (if not more so) ,Â there's nothing left to trade,with
It 's clear that the Lannister Cash reserves were spent on the war and so Casterly Rock may well be facing a liquidity crisis that Tywin and Kevin have been hiding from Cerci and the rest of the world

So in that theory, the reason he's telling this lie to Cersei and not the small council is to convince Cersei that the Tyrells are needed? And the reason the show brings up the issue (in addition to further introducing us to the IBB and the decline of Lannisters) is to assure the audience that the decisions Cersei makes after Tywin's death are not due to some instinctive suspicion that the Tyrells might've been involved in Joff's death, but that it is simply irrational, paranoid behaviour and that she should know better?

They didn't seek Stannis. He sought them. All he has to do is demonstrate a compelling case for why he would be a lower bad debt risk than the Lannisters. Actually, he doesn't even have to demonstrate that. If they believe he can pay them back AND they believe the Lannisters will also pay them back, why not fund both sides to raise both sides debt exposure to the IBB. Its a high-risk game, but also higher reward. The IBB will own them both.

Â 
Not relevant to the debate here, but I must still point out that in the books it was the Iron Bank (via Tycho something) that sought Stannis, not the other way around (as in the show). Tycho went to the Wall, hoping to find Stannis IIRC, after Cersei's refusal to pay.

Â 
Most dont mind changes. But we find those changes botched in so many ways with very little value added. The show could have stated that the war have strained badly their ressources, that robb sacking their castle has done more damage that they let know, that stannis is still on the field and they may have to save coin in order to face him. If the aim is to underline the need of the tyrels, suffice to say they are the key to the south, the north is still unsetteled and dorne is dubious at best. Make it about food and supplies if you want. Make it about bad harvest to come. Make it something else.
Â 
Why make them completly out of gold? What does that bring to the show compared to how it damages character evolution and actions? why create such potential butterfly effects with so very little value added?
Â 
It is the same for what happens in the wall, the hole gilly to mole town and then oh crap i forgot they were wildlings attacking villages. Then lets make it to crasters for whatever reason just when bran is there and ghost is in a cage well fed..
Â 
For me, D&D have botched the after purple wedding episodes. this seaon is very confusing and sometimes boring even for a non book reader ( i happen to watch the show with one). the trade offs made vs the book do not bring anything to the show IMHO. If the craster thing was to bring some good action and rythm well it was badely build as a plot and not that good watching.
Â 
what is critized is not the change or the show not being canon. It is what I consider botched writingÂ
1859	Cas Stark	2014-05-06	Right. Â It isn't Â that all change is bad, but changes like this....which is really a huge change, there is no more gold, e.g. the Lannisters no matter what they do can never regain or maintain their position, is too much when the purpose is most likely to simply emphasize the Iron Bank's power.
Â 
It will totally change Cersei's motivations for what she does in the future, making her destroying the Tyrell alliance even crazier than it was in the book.
Â 
It occurred to me that the books could reveal this later on, but I'm not sure even GRRM could plausibly put together a scenario where the mines have been dry for 3 years and somehow Tywin has managed to keep this a secret....how could he do this? Â The miners would know they're either not finding gold anymore or not mining at all, and to keep this quiet would require tons of money on its own for payoffs and security, etc.
Â 
It could be that in the future the mines will dry up as the final blow to the Lannisters, but pulling it forward this much makes too much difference in Cersei's storyline.
1860	Lord Varys	2014-05-06	After re-watching this dreadful episode, I realized that Tywin explicitly mentions 'the mines in the Westerlands'. This means not only the personal mines of House Lannister are dry, but all the mines in the Westerlands, including those of Tywin's bannermen.
Â 
Can anyone possibly believe this would not be public knowledge among the nobility of Westeros, if this is the case since three fucking years? The Crown would have known about that, Robert would have known about that, Ned would have known about that, everyone would have known about that, and no one would have ever mentioned the outrageous amount of money the Lannisters supposedly possessed. Nor would have anyone have feared Tywin's wealth throughout the coming war, if he could not really afford to spent that much money during the fighting.
Â 
What happened to 'Gold wins wars, not soldiers', 'Have you ever heard the phrase 'as rich as a Lannister', 'Not so much money as the Lannisters [Renly to Loras about Mace's riches]', 'the richest man in the Seven Kingdoms' etc.?
Â 
This series rewrites itself and is already hugely contradicting itself. Loras was already a member of the KG and cannot join Joffrey's KG now because he would then lose his claim to Highgarden as Mace's only son? Why did he then join Renly's KG? Season 2 established the Tyrells only as third power insofar as their manpower is concerned. The Lannisters and Starks were the most powerful houses according to Littlefinger's conversation with Tywin. Now the Tyrells are not even more powerful but also richer than the Lannisters.
1861	Chebyshov	2014-05-06	After re-watching this dreadful episode, I realized that Tywin explicitly mentions 'the mines in the Westerlands'. This means not only the personal mines of House Lannister are dry, but all the mines in the Westerlands, including those of Tywin's bannermen.

Â 
I had the same exact thought. If it is a plot point in TWOW (though as has been mentioned, Kevan and Cersei never thought twice about it), then it seems like it'd have to be a recent development, not one three years in the making. My only thought is that maybe just Tywin knows all the mines dried up, and everyone else in the Westerlands assumes there are other mines with gold still, even if theirs are without? Seems unlikely no one would know about this though.
1862	DrownedSnow	2014-05-06	The Lannisters would have such huge stacks of gold it wouldn't be all gone right away so the three years things make sense. They have plenty of other income to sustain themselves outside of war time but with war they couldn't maintain paying for the expenses of the kingdom forever. I still think this change has more to do with explaining why Tywin, and eventually Kevan, didn't pay off the Iron Bank. They are looking to make that a point before the end of the season so it would be before Tywin is killed and Cersei has a chance to tell the bank where to stick it. It would make zero sense to the TV audience that Tywin didn't pay them if he could.
Â 
Â 
Basically, what do you think show viewers would find less believable, that Tywin kept the empty mines quiet or that he wouldn't use his infinite gold to avoid making a big enemy? How many people will even question that ruthless Tywin killed off anyone he needed to keep it quiet or just used already mined gold to make it appear they were still working or something? Doubt most will give it a thought. When the Iron Bank starts to turn the tides against the Lannisters they all would have been shouting "why didn't Tywin pay them off with his endless supply of gold."

1863	Carolus Rex	2014-05-06	Yes, but if the gold supply had been running out, it'd have been a gradual long-term process, a process Tywin would have had to deal with, and which everyone else would know about. Mines don't suddenly go from healthy capacity to nothing overnight, unless there's war, disaster, or Margaret Thatcher involved.Haha! Made me laugh out. Now I gotta explain why I'm reading this at work...As to the topic. I don't really know what to think of the gold mine is dry quote. Tywin has never ever seemed like a man who'd flat out lie about something to manipulate. Twist the truth, leave out important bits, or just do the "your this close to death"-stare, but not lying.So either a big deviation from the books, or something they know that we don't.
1864	Dorne Sand	2014-05-06	Â When the Iron Bank starts to turn the tides against the Lannisters they all would have been shouting "why didn't Tywin pay them off with his endless supply of gold."

Because tywin could have stated it to cersei in the same dialogue. Saying that there is no way that the lannister family should pay the crown dept to the iron bank, that it will diminish them too much, that they need instead to restore order as soon as possible, build harvests and raise taxes and suffer all tyrels needs in order for them to participate in the debt issue. that even if he wanted too, the war has depleted their actual ressources, that stannis is in the field, that westerlands are at risk with the ironmen blocking the sea etc etc. then all cersei had to do, was keep that in mind and backlash at the banker when he will claim his due. No need of depleting the mines
1865	DrownedSnow	2014-05-06	Except that Tywin has already mentioned, more than once, that the Iron Bank shouldn't be messed with and that they will have their due. No explanation other than an inability to pay works because otherwise it makes Tywin an idiot and we've already seen he is too cunning for that. All of this comes from them bringing the Iron Bank stuff forward. In the books Tywin was making payments to the Iron Bank so it wasn't an issue. If he had to pay them off he would have, and probably should have, but he didn't expect to die and there is no way he could have known Cersei would do what she did. Since show Tywin looks to be the one creating the problem with the bank they have to give reason to it. It's actually really simple. I just hope this is not something that becomes a part of the books because it wouldn't make as much sense there as the damage is already done.

1866	Lord Varys	2014-05-06	This is clearly not foreshadowing a plot point in book series. The Lannisters are done anyway, they don't need to be broke, they have different problems in the books - bad leaders (Cersei), bad claims (Tommen, Myrcella), and they have alienated most/all of their allies. If GRRM hammered a fact home with the history of House Lannister (as far as know it yet) then that money is not everything. We know that Tytos sucked as a Lord, and there are other average/bad Lannister leaders. Lord Damon, who lost a battle during the Blackfyre Rebellion and hid under Casterly Rock, Lord Jason Lannister, who somehow got himself killed early on during the Dance of the Dragons, Ser Tyland Lannister, who did not exactly excel himself as Master of Ships (no navy) and who seemed to have done next to nothing as Master of Coin during the Dance.
Â 
This thing clearly is only in there to build up tension for Stannis' negotiations with the Iron Bank.

Ignoring the IB so rudely and blatantly was a big mistake on Cersei's part. That much is clear or else, GRRM wouldn't have bothered putting that scene in there.

1871	Veltigar	2014-05-06	The show and are no longer close to being the same, it ended with this, and the Tyrells, you know the guys who produceÂ nearly all the foodÂ goods which would require a lot of smallfolk thus producing a lot of soldiers, have the least amount of warriors.


When did they take their army away? I must have erased that particular fuck up out of my memory.

It will have his due but not from the lannisters. And the show doesn't state how they will have their due, or the cunning of tywin to avoid the issue. Just that his is powerless. It would have worked better in my opinion if tywin stated that he will take a calculated risk, needing to stall the return of the debt compared to the actual threats composed of ironmen, stannis, endangering his house the war efforts conceded... He just have to say that the iron bank will have to wait as he has no choice 
	Spoiler and let cersei do the botching after his death by adding her usual carelessness and lack diplomacy

It just seems so huge in implications compared to the problem the scenarists needed to solve such as a timing issue
1873	Cas Stark	2014-05-06	Can't we admit this was a poorly thought out and unnecessary change?
Â 
The problem with the IB wasn't that they couldn't pay the debt "Right Now" but that Cersei stopped making any payments at all, which is something Tywin wouldn't have done, gold or no gold. Â Nor is it believable that there has been no gold mined for 3 years and no one knows it or even suspects it. Â

Only if she knows her way around KL better than say, Jaqen. You wouldn't want her to botch such an important job and end up getting caught, after all.
1875	Lord Varys	2014-05-06	I never said that the Iron Bank is not important for the plot in the books. Of course it is. I only meant that Tywin's stupid lines in the TV show are not foreshadowing the Lannisters being or becoming broke in the books as well as the TV show. That's not going to happen.
Â 
In fact, Kevan's death will put the Crown in a very difficult position because the enmity/rift between the Lannisters and the Tyrells will effectively prevent King Tommen from using his mother's coin to pay the Crown's debts. Kevan considered doing just that, but Mace as Lord Regent/Hand will not have access to the gold of Casterly Rock. Despite being very rich, I guess the wealth of House Tyrell cannot be moved or transformed as easily into coin/gold as the gold of Casterly Rock could be shipped to Braavos. The Tyrells will have revenues through various incomes, taxes, and such, but their coin should come mostly from the food they sell to other people.
Â 
If Mace ends up in control of the city/Crown but Cersei flees the city (with Tommen), Mace might face severe difficulties...
1876	The Kinkslayer	2014-05-06	For all the gold in Casterly Rock, I'd like the show to stop the Ironbank name dropping.

Drink for every time the IBB is mentioned! Its much more fun!
1878	Tixu Oty	2014-05-06	OK, so all I want to say is this: Is Cersei bipolar or what??
Â 
I mean, I don't mind the fact that the Lannisters mines no longer produce gold in the show, and let's ignore the fact that is has been so for three years and still nobody knows...
I'm going to side with those who say the purpose of that scene was to emphasize the facts that the alliance is important and that the Iron Bank is not to be messed with. I was really happy with all the Iron Bank namedrops since lots of us have predicted on these very boards that the Iron Bank and the Faceless Men will be big players in WoW. So yes, I'm glad to see they're not downplayed in the show, that looks good to me.
However, I do think the no more working mines thing was an unnecessary oversimplification.... sigh.
Â 
What I didn't get, though, was the fact that this speech came AFTER Cersei being all nice to Margaery. I mean stressing the importance of the alliance didn't seem so much needed if Cersei is already acting wise enough of her own free will. What is up with that? I mean some of you here have speculated that she's only sucking up to the Tyrells because of Tyrion's upcoming trial, but if that's the case, it really wasn't obvious at all. I mean to me, she seemed to genuinely accept, and even suggest the Tommen/Margaery wedding. Wow. Guys I admire your confidence, but I don't know.
Â 


Totally agree. Also, Cersei not being stupid and making alliance with Margaery? waat




I was blown away with the Cersei cozy up to Margeary. She hates her from the begginning. Also, her dissing on Joff like that. Joff was her pride and Joy, could do no wrong. The worse thing book Cersei ever says about Joff was that he was "willfull". Whitewashing of Cersei is quite dissapointing as she was just as evil as Joff.




Why does everybody take whatever Cersei says at face value? I mean, every word she says just screams "lie". She was as much sympathising with Margaery as she was being nice to Sansa in season 1. It's an act, a deliberate attempt to make Margaery say something that she can use to cast her down.




For some odd reason people feel she has gone soft this pass episode, but if you have seen her character and know who is you would know she is simply scheming to get others on her side for the trial and to sympathize. Its clear as day.


Â 
See, the thing is, I only started reading the books a year ago, after binge watching the first two seasons of GoT. And when I started reading Cersei's POV in Feast I was very surprised to see that she was so fucking crazy because the show had really not prepared me for that, and the first three books didn't really prove me wrong either. What's worse is that in Feast it seemed that she wasn't BECOMING crazy, she had basically always been that way, but was starting to unravel because power. OK, so I read Feast and Dance and accepted the fact that Cersei was no more than a crazy evil bitch. Alright. So I watched season 3 with that in mind and that went ok. Beginning of season 4 was even better at planting the seeds of reckless craziness. But now, now I'm lost. I don't care that show Cersei is different than book Cersei, I can live with that. My problem is that show Cersei seems to contradict herself. I mean she hated Margaery in season 3. She hated the idea of marrying Loras. And now that her son's dead she starts acting wise??? wtf?!
Â 


I agree, and it goes back to one of the worst moments in GOT's history with Xaro being broke...what the hell was that? They did it so quickly and so poorly to make sure nobody questioned it, but it was absurd. Seemed like a disney ending. Hope they don't go that route for the Lannisters.Â 


Â 
I was cool with that. It seemed to work nicely with Varys's power is a shadow thing. I thought it was a nice trick, though I do miss book Xaro.
Â 


I just thought of something about this. I was under the impression that the Iron Bank wanted to get its due from the coffers of Casterly Rock (and Highgarden, the Twins, and other Houses that supported Tommen, I guess, but mostly Casterly Rock), but now that the Lannisters are broke how will the IB get back its gold? Like, why fund someone to beat an enemy who's broke?


Â 
For one, even if they never get their money back, it sends a message. Also, it is implied that the Iron Bank can be really ruthless and find whatever way to get its due, though it's not important at this point how and doesn't need to come to that.
Second, in the book, Stannis is lent money only on the condition that he agrees to repay all the crown's debt in addition to his own. Clearly Stannis has no choice but to accept. And we all know how Stannis is. He'd find a way to get that money. Unlike Kevan, he probably wouldn't care to much if the people are not happy because of taxes.
1879	salmonsnake	2014-05-06	No one thinks Marg was being sincere in that scene. Why would Cersei be? I thought the 'sister' thing made this clear.
1880	Chebyshov	2014-05-06	No one thinks Marg was being sincere in that scene. Why would Cersei be? I thought the 'sister' thing made this clear.


Â 
Lena's acting was brilliant in this scene. Marg is obviously testing her (especially being told if she calls Cersei "sister" again, she'll be strangled in her sleep), and Cersei is sucking it up to secure votes. You can tell how much Cersei doesn't want to say what she does just before she says "he'll need help."

I don't hugely object to the Marg scene, but it's out of character for Book and TV Cersei...TV Cersei is actually more likely to make overt threats than Book Cersei..but then I hated the line about her having Marg strangled to begin with...because neither Book nor TV Cersei would have done that with her father still alive. Â Oh well.

I do expect Lena to kill it as Cersei begins to totally lose it and give in to all of her crazy paranoid fantasies.

It seems like it to us but I bet show watchers won't bat an eye about him keeping the mines running out a secret. Keep in mind that even productive mines aren't always in use. If the Lannisters were often sitting on more gold than they could spend then why would mines be in full swing? It makes more sense to close some and rotate or lower/raise production as needed. Only a few people would know the real measure and Tywin could pay them or kill them. It's not a stretch to think that those most likely to suspect anything could be amiss would be Lannister bannermen and what exactly would they care? It's not this big logical leap people seem to be implying. I don't like it and it's not as clean as it could be but its not impossible.
Â 
Â 
And no, it's not about them being able to pay off the full debt right away but it does make sense that they would if they had more money than the gods. If Cersei tells the bank to suck it next season, which may not even happen now, the audience would rightly wonder why Tywin hadn't dealt with it before and why Cersei wouldn't just pay up. They've given reason to both. However, the show isn't the books and characters have different motivations sometimes. I'm betting that since Davos may be going to Bravos THIS season they just setting up that Tywin has already missed a few payments because neither he nor the crown could afford them at the moment. This just speeds up that whole plot point and maybe gives Stannis Â those troops sooner rather than later. Who knows. The only thing I am pretty sure of is that they are not going to stick to the events of the books here.

That's what D&D rely on....that they can throw out plot points and then drop them later and no one notices...the TV audience will, presumably think 'oh the Lannisters are broke and that's why they can't pay the IB'...
Â 
Which turns Cersei into not a really terrible ruler with bad judgement, but a poor gal thrown into a situation she can't control who is doing the best she can. Â Gag me.
Â 
The only reason they're having Stannis go to the IB instead of vice versa is because it's better TV...more dramatic, there is no actual plot logic afoot there. Â IMO

Aha, you may have a point there!
Â 


Â 
Let me direct you to:Â http://asoiaf.wester...ciation-thread/


Â 
Thanks Chebyshov, I'll take a look at that thread, see if it can convince me. Right now, I guess I gotta accept the fact that Cersei suddenly decided to suck it up to people she hates because it's the explanation that makes the most sense, but I still don't find it quite satisfactory. Waiting for some more explanation on this Cersei/money/Tyrell thing in episodes to come.
1893	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-06	Â 
Which turns Cersei into not a really terrible ruler with bad judgement, but a poor gal thrown into a situation she can't control who is doing the best she can. Â Gag me.


Â 
i didn't think of that...but your right..that would really suck...Cersei's epic fails are what i've been dying to see happen...
Â 
but just like after Oathkeeper, i had faith that D&D would not make such a huge blunder as to reunite Bran/Jon, im going to be patient and hope that they will still show her jerking the IB guy around and display it more as her doing it just because she can vs. doing it to save face for circumstances beyond her control...
Â 
one small ray of hope is that Tywin was referring to the the Lannisters having no gold while the IB (in the book) comes to collect on the loans to the Crown...if you recall when Tyrion was master of coin, he mentions to Tywin how the Crown owes the Lannisters 3 million and Tywin implies (not unclearly) that the Crown and Lannister fortunes are not the same thing...
Â 
it does make sense if you think about it...it was the crown that borrowed the gold from the IB to fund their wars...even if the Lannisters were overflowing in gold (like the books implied), why would the Lannister estate pay for the debts incurred by the crown?
Â 
while i might be wrong on this, i do not believe any monarch has ever used his/her own finances to pay for Government expenses/debts...
Â 
so i will hope that D&D will not screw up Cersei's screw ups and will indeed show her as inept and stupid as she is in the booksÂ

Oh I have faith in them with her plot moving forward. In fact they've already set up seeds of her demise to the point where last episode, a scene started where all we saw was wine being poured into a goblet, and immediately I was like "Cersei?"

Â 
hahaha, your absolutely right...in the scene with Tywin and Cersei when she stands up at the end and its looks like she almost sways a bit before steadying herself on the table, i couldn't help wondering "is she always drunk?" im sure not everyone left the same, but I guess i'm conditioned to think she's always drunk, so always looking for slight sways and slursÂ
1896	DrownedSnow	2014-05-06	Â 
That's what D&D rely on....that they can throw out plot points and then drop them later and no one notices...the TV audience will, presumably think 'oh the Lannisters are broke and that's why they can't pay the IB'...
Â

Â 
The only reason they're having Stannis go to the IB instead of vice versa is because it's better TV...more dramatic, there is no actual plot logic afoot there. Â IMO


Â 
Â 
Â 
Is it better TV? I think it's simpler TV, quicker. I don't like a lot of the changes to characters such as Stannis, Shae, and Cersei but that is just comparing them to the books. I think they made changes to make them more or less likeable for reasons that I don't see. Although, I do think when they make plot changes it does usually add up in the end. I just hate them doing things to shorten storylines then giving us filler arcs or whole filler characters like Ros (though I liked Locke). Like why didn't Ygritte attack in episode one? I'll bet that decision has more to do with the budget than anything else. I'm actually afraid the Mance attack won't happen at all or won't be shown. This is stuff that really effects the show to me. At least I can count on them using the Lannsters limited resources to establish a character motivation, even if it's unique to the show.
Â 
Cersei stuff is confusing because people hate her and they can't change that no matter how tortured they make her. She just chooses to do messed up things. Even if they cut her and the Iron Bank entirely she is still going to be a terrible ruler and screw things up. If she goes completely off the rails it may even be more effective this way. We shall see.

They don't like Stannis, they have said as much, that's why that change.
Â 
I will give them a pass on Cersei, even though they've gone overboard with the whitewash, because she's in the show for the long haul, and after Tywin dies it will only be her and Marg in KL...so making her a one note villain wouldn't work too well to keep viewers interested.

I have no idea why they changed Shae and I am convinced that change is going to bite them in the ass hard, unless they have Tywin kill her and not Tyrion.

Because owning the full 9 million debt to Lannisters is safer for his grandchildren and Tywin is all about family, otherwise he would have killed Tyrion long ago. They've been largely covering any crown expenses under Robert and now that Lannister blood sits the throne they would do the same. In the book the crown is making the payments so it's not an issue while Tywin is alive. Had there been a need in the book you can bet Tywin would have paid the Iron Bank and transfered the debt, especially because they are portrayed as having an infinite supply of gold. It still makes zero sense that Robert racked up that much debt in the first place. Did he cut taxes to zero?
Â 
I think that rulers have used their own money many times throughout history to raise an army or some such thing. A lot of kings would simply take their "personal" money from the treasury and the king and country were the same thing. I king couldn't be like "I'm loaded but my country is bankrupt" unless he didn't want to be king anymore.

Â 
They don't? Didn't know that. Stannis is a loveable old buzzkill in the books. I liked him as honorable but he still let others believe in or say what they wanted so long as they followed their duty. Him burning "infidels" really changed his character. They want him to be more of a villain maybe? They've done good stuff with characters like Tywin and Margaery though so it's give and take I guess.
Â 
Cersei and the goings on in King's Landing are going to be front and center for a while so it is sensible to not want viewers to be sick of her. I just don't think its working. Her fans like her because she's a such a &$%#@. Wonder if she's going to be begging for gold from Highgarden soon. I hope she just demands they start sending more money after the wedding because they need to "pull their weight" or something. That would be hilarious.
1900	TheFullmetalAlchemist	2014-05-06	It's a fairly silly turn, in the sense that no, it's not thought out, much as their turn with Xaro's "wealthiest man in Qarth is in fact bankrupt" thing -- both raise the same questions. You'd think someone whose father was a banking executive might have at least a little more respect for the fundamentals of economics... or maybe not, I guess, after the bailouts? 
Â 
But in any case, I think it's fairly obvious that the change is there to mitigate Cersei still further. She's not going to tell the Iron Bank she won't pay up because she's recklessly arrogant on the topic... but because she'll have no choice. Boo-hoo. 
Â 
(Yeah, not a fan of the whitewash. She's such a bland character.)


Â 
lol. D&D are really going overboard with the Cercei whitewashing. It's way past nauseating at this point.Â

They did an interview in S2 saying words to the effect "Stannis would be a terrible king". I took it to mean that they wanted people to focus on Renly. Some people took offense to the statement. More recently however, Weiss seems to be continuing that line. Benioff to me appears more balanced, but people just lump them together anyway.
1902	marsyao	2014-05-06	I just wonder how Tywin manages to keep a secrect about all of his gold mines has dried up at least 3 years ago? Many people would work in Lannister minning indistry, workers, clerks, administrators, traders, guards and their families, there is no way these people would not know Lannister gold mine produce no gold now, by what way Tywin have these people keep their mouths shut? He obviously can not have them killed or put them in prison, since that would be equal to reveal his secrect

Â 
You're not supposed to think about it. Â You're supposed to register only "Lannisters are broke". Â 
Â 
Clearly, keeping such a thing secret would be virtually impossible. Â And, knowing Tywin Lannister, even if it were true, he would have spent the last 3 years coming up with an alternate source of income...they would go into shipping or something. Â He wouldn't sit on his ass and do nothing, lending out his remaining $$ to the Iron Throne...all the while spending Â money like water all over Westeros.
1904	Seneti	2014-05-06	OK, so all I want to say is this: Is Cersei bipolar or what??
Â 
[...]
Â 
What I didn't get, though, was the fact that this speech came AFTER Cersei being all nice to Margaery. I mean stressing the importance of the alliance didn't seem so much needed if Cersei is already acting wise enough of her own free will. What is up with that? I mean some of you here have speculated that she's only sucking up to the Tyrells because of Tyrion's upcoming trial, but if that's the case, it really wasn't obvious at all. I mean to me, she seemed to genuinely accept, and even suggest the Tommen/Margaery wedding. Wow. Guys I admire your confidence, but I don't know.


Â 
Â 


Â 
I think she was just playing Margaery. This is Cersei, after all. She may not be the smartest player of the GoT (and certainly not the sanest) but she isn't that stupid either.


Â 
This. Cersei was lying. She was trying to:
1) see if Margaery would say something incriminating that would give her away as a social-ladder-climbing, power-hogging Tyrell b**** (basically tempting her to tell Cersei "yeah, Joff was horrible, I only married him for the crown and now I'm marrying Tommen for just the same reason")
2) play nice with Margaery so she would convince her father to judge Tyrion harshly.
Â 
ShowCersei has just as much love for Margaery as BookCersei: zero, nada, zip.

Â 
agree to that if they have the cash, without it, doesnt matter who owns the debt, because if Crown owes it to Lannisters and Lannisters borrowed from Iron Banks, puts the "Family" in greater risk...
Â 


Â

Â 
i thought of this as well. Â i mean they have just been spending like crazy havent they? the wedding, the war etc? (or were those covered by the Crown and not the groom's family?) Tywin did not say the lannisters being bankrupt,Â He mentions that the mines have run dry in the westerlands...
Â 
this is Big Daddy Tywin we're talking about, he's got plans and contingency plans for everything...basically ended the northern rebellion using just Frey and Bolton...you can bet that he anticipated this day a long time ago...he's been at Casterly Rock since resigning as Hand of the King over 20 years ago right? He would never be that stupid to just put all his eggs in one basket, mining.Â 
Â 
everyone invested in mining anything knows eventually well runs dry. While Lannisters might have had a huge influx of gold because of the mines, they MUST have other sources of income...
Â 
so i dont believe this means Lannisters have no money, just rather that they've taken a big hit and need another resourceful family's alliance to maintain their facade..something very common for uber-wealthy families even in the real world
1906	The Fallen	2014-05-06	`  I'm sure it's been mentioned already, but I guess Kevan didn't get the memo in ADwD when he thinks they may have to pay the I.B. from their own money.
1907	Hielo y Fuego	2014-05-06	Â 
Right, she's just not as smart as she thinks she is.


Â 
Exactly. I've always gotten the impression that Cersei truly believes to be as smart and shrewd as her father, even though we all know that the apple fell very far from the tree.
Â 
Â 


This. Cersei was lying. She was trying to:
1) see if Margaery would say something incriminating that would give her away as a social-ladder-climbing, power-hogging Tyrell b**** (basically tempting her to tell Cersei "yeah, Joff was horrible, I only married him for the crown and now I'm marrying Tommen for just the same reason")
2) play nice with Margaery so she would convince her father to judge Tyrion harshly.
Â 
ShowCersei has just as much love for Margaery as BookCersei: zero, nada, zip.


Â 
Either this or she was trying to find the buttons in Margaery, see if she could push them the way she did with Sansa. Obviously, Cersei must know that Marg is not nearly as gullible and won't be as easy to handle and manipulate as Sansa, and so she has to find other ways to do it.
Â 
Since it appears that there will be no Kettleblacks in the show, I think this is all about D&D finding another way for Cersei to keep an eye on Marg and find evidence she can use against her in future seasons.
1908	acosta	2014-05-06	I don't get why so many people are saying the Lannisters are "broke." They still own all the gold they've mined for the last however many thousand years and didn't spend, a whole lot of productive land and all of the tariffs and taxes of their bannermen and peasantry, plus the debt the crown owes them. They haven't themselves been borrowing from the Iron Bank. They're still a major creditor, probably the biggest creditor on Westeros.Â 
Â 
Having the mines run dry just means they need to restructure their business operations and plan a different wealth maintenance strategy for the future, one that does not involve spending huge sums of money, going to war with other wealthy families, and definitely not one that involves paying other people's debts, though they probably still have the ability. I'm sure they're still in the black more than the crown is in the red.Â
1909	The brown snake	2014-05-07	I think this means that the debt to the iron bank will be mentioned more and more. And the wedding to the Tyrells is so important because the Lannisters may be wanting to stash their gold away for the next thousand years as they will be unable to be 'the most powerful house' in a thousand years as they do not have any more gold.
The Tryells land is still green moist and fertile... The old lion might be wanting them to pay the bank.

Â 
Â 
You'd be very wrong here,Â 
I don't see Tywin or any of his predecessors as a Scrooge McDuck type character with a large gold vault they go swimming in.
The money has been spent over the years, either on Improving Casterly Rock, buying influence or general preening.
Â 
A wise ruler like Tywin knows that gold sitting in a vault doesn't grow, whereas investing wisely can see it multiply
Â 
Tywin was obviously lending significant money to the Iron Throne in order to buy influence and what contingency reserves he was keeping would have been spent on the war.
Whilst he's still in theory rich, with most of his wealth tied up in loans to the crown and with his tax base in the Westlands devastated he has a liquidity problem
One of the reasons he's so keen to get control of KL and the finances (and probably why he made Tyrion master of coin) is that he needs the crown to start repaying some of its debtsÂ
1911	Tixu Oty	2014-05-07	I wonder if we'll get to know who replaces Tyrion as Master of Coins?
1912	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-07	Seems to be more endgame foreshadowing than anything else.
1913	Juan_Snow	2014-05-07	I for one didn't take what Tywin said to mean that the Lannisters are broke. Â The active mines are simply dry. Â That doesn't mean they don't have gold. Â It's quite possible they still have plenty of gold. Â They just aren't stockpiling gold like they once did, so they can't afford to pay the Crown's debts any longer. Â It also doesn't mean they won't find another mine, or continue to collect on the loans they've made.
1914	ChrisSnow77	2014-05-07	Exactly. I mean, I suppose they went to one another, "Well, why didn't Tywin just buy the crown out of debt?" Because in the book he actively refuses to cancel the crown's debts to him, but I think that's obviously because he isn't going to cripple the Lannisters by erasing debt while everyone else gets to hold the crown's debts to them; it makes the Lannisters relatively weaker compared to the rest, and that's never going to happen.
Â 
So maybe they went, "Well, why doesn't Cersei cancel the debt, at least?" And... probably because she loves being Lady of Casterly Rock and isn't going to weaken herself relative to the other debt holders, either. Better to weaken them by telling them to fuck off or to take stuff she's very happy to give in return for debt forgiveness. But no, that's too significant a pettiness to allow to stand.
Â 
I could, of course, be wrong. But there's obviously been a pattern from day 1 with their treatment of Cersei of filing down the rough edges, so to speak, and this conveniently seems to fit that pattern.


Â 
I think you make a great point... it seems like the last few episodes they've tried really hard to make Cersei to be a more sympathetic character than the books did, and this is yet another piece towards that.

1918	Gabriel Belmont the Dragon	2014-05-07	So the lannisters are broke thats a surprise but when you think about the wars, the mass spending during king roberts reign it kinda falls into place my guess Tywin might a emergency gold stash somewhere in case of this. he is right though about paying the iron bank back
1919	Lord Varys	2014-05-07	As we are discussing Cersei in this thread now, can anyone explain to me if this non-Cersei-character has any other character trait than being a mother who loves her children - or, rather, who is supposed to love her children, because that's what she's repeating in every episode in every scene since that very dreadful 'black-haired boy scene'. Does she wants power? Does she want to rule, either in her own name, or as power behind the throne? If so, why was she appalled by the murdering of Robert's children if she was the one who arranged Robert's assassination (she did that in the show, didn't she?)?
Â 
I really don't understand her character. Not because she is not book Cersei, I'm really trying to understand TV Cersei as an independent character, but I'm not sure what's supposed what's driving her.
Â 
Book Cersei is a very simple character, whereas D&D's Cersei seems to be a completely blank character.
Â 
As to the debt thing:
Â 
House Lannister earns money by not forgiving the crown's debts. And three million gold dragons (possibly somewhat more after the War of the Five Kings) is really a lot of money, I'd think.
Â 
But it's entirely likely that Cersei did not insist that the Crown pay its monthly sum to Casterly Rock. She would have decided that all by himself, since she was Queen Regent and Lady of Casterly Rock in one person (just as Tywin was Hand of the King and Lord of Casterly Rock). But this would not really help the Crown if it's still in need of money - which it is, especially since Cersei starts to build new, expensive ships -, as the North, the Riverlands, the Vale, the Iron Islands, the Stormlands, and the Reach should have paid pretty much no taxes throughout most of the war. Dorne most likely pays little anyway, since they are by far the most independent kingdom. Actual war costs were pretty low for KL, since the Iron Throne did neither hire nor pay most of the men fighting in the Realm, but with such a shortage of incomes there would be literally no money left for the rebuilding afterwards...

you know what this calls for.....season 1 to 4 marathon!Â
1921	Lord Varys	2014-05-07	Well, perhaps I made my point no clear enough:
Â 
TV Cersei is a completely erratic character. What's the point of her bonding time with Margaery in last week's episode if their last conversation ended with 'If you call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep'. I honestly don't get it.
Â 
It's the same with Tyrion-Cersei. Cersei loathes her brother because he has killed their mother at his birth, that has been established in season 2. But if that's the case, why the hell does Cersei spend her leisure time with Tyrion in season 3 after he has threatened to turn her joy to ashes in her mouth? They even bond over the whole forced/arranged marriage issue. She repeatedly visits him, talks to him, even drinks with him. I know that Lena and Peter are very good friends in real life, and this shows in their scenes together - there is just no real enmity/loathing between these two characters.
Â 
And is there a hidden agenda? Does she even want power? Or did she just kill Robert because Ned threatened her life, Jaime's life, and the life of her children by telling her that he would tell Robert? TV Cersei never made a real grasp for power. She did not delight in presiding over the Small Council or calling the shots in KL. She was only afraid. Afraid of Joffrey, afraid of Tyrion, afraid of Stannis.Â 
Â 
I try to understand the characters as D&D-characters now. They created them, they changed them to fit their vision - surely they have some sort of concept for each character.
1922	Fat Trell	2014-05-07	TV-Cersei's hobbies seem to include talking about how much she loves her children and the tortured role of wives/mothers. She wants be left alone with her children, but she doesn't want to spend much time with them apparently. She's a fan of rape-play incestual sex too. Also wine.
Â 
Seriously she comes off as a depressed women who loves her children and is utterly miserable with her lot in life. She doesn't seem to have much personal ambition..
1923	NewJeffCT	2014-05-07	From the books, I always had the impression that the Lannisters were still pretty rich and were still taking in money, and not just because the crown owes them 3 million+Â 
Â 
Didn't Tyrion have them make a rather large amount of steel weapons & armor for the clans of the Vale so they could better harass Lysa and her bannermen? Â That doesn't seem like something a kingdom that is running out of money would do in hopes it pays off a year or two or five down the road, and also not something where you'd be relying on the crown to pay you back regularly. Â Plus, even back then, Tywin didn't love Tyrion, so wouldn't have been using his meager savings on a costly up front suggestion Tyrion had made, especially since he may not have trusted that Tyrion could control these clans.
1924	sifth	2014-05-07	Exactly. I mean, I suppose they went to one another, "Well, why didn't Tywin just buy the crown out of debt?" Because in the book he actively refuses to cancel the crown's debts to him, but I think that's obviously because he isn't going to cripple the Lannisters by erasing debt while everyone else gets to hold the crown's debts to them; it makes the Lannisters relatively weaker compared to the rest, and that's never going to happen.
Â 
So maybe they went, "Well, why doesn't Cersei cancel the debt, at least?" And... probably because she loves being Lady of Casterly Rock and isn't going to weaken herself relative to the other debt holders, either. Better to weaken them by telling them to fuck off or to take stuff she's very happy to give in return for debt forgiveness. But no, that's too significant a pettiness to allow to stand.
Â 
I could, of course, be wrong. But there's obviously been a pattern from day 1 with their treatment of Cersei of filing down the rough edges, so to speak, and this conveniently seems to fit that pattern.


Â 
But not paying the Iron Bank always seemed silly, especially for a smart character like Tywin. Surely he at least would of known how dangerous they were, so why not at least pay off that portion of the debt using Lannister gold. I mean the last thing House Lannister needed was another enemy. For a guy that rich it should be just a drop in the bucket or close to it.
1925	Fat Trell	2014-05-07	Â

For a guy that rich it should be just a drop in the bucket or close to it.


Â 
The debt isn't a problem until Cersei makes it one. The Iron Bank doesn't require immediate payment of all money owed. They're a bank, they're more than content to receive smallerÂ payments at an interest. They just need steady payment as an assurance that they will get paid in full eventually.
Â 
Tywin most likely understood that while he could ignore collections on debt owed to himself, the faith, and the Tyrells for a time; keeping up with payments to the IB was crucial to prevent them becoming involved with either Stannis or Dany. The Crown would have had the money to keep paying the bank without Cersei's frivolities and a competent Master of Coin.
Â 
I doubt the IB would have taken such extreme action or approached Tywin in the same way they did Cersei either.
1926	Lord Varys	2014-05-08	The show really sucks because they suddenly make the Iron Bank the party the Crown owes the most amount of money, when in fact it is only one of many parties the Iron Throne is indebted to. It owes lots of money to Casterly Rock, Highgarden, and the Faith as well, and Cersei actually succeeds in canceling the 900,000 and somewhat gold dragons the Crown owes to the Faith, in exchange for revoking Maegor's laws.
Â 
From a story-wise perspective it's just stupid to introduce the Iron Bank story now, if they make them appear as if the Lannisters cannot afford to pay the Crown's debts. How the hell is Stannis supposed to pay Robert's, Joffrey's, Tommen's, and his own debts after he ascended the Iron Throne? Surely his plan in the books is to eventually attain House Lannister and use its wealth to give the Iron Bank its due. But he cannot do that in the show, can he?
Â 
Stannis could have had something better to do, if they had given him a much better story in season 3-4. Say, by introducing Selyse, Shireen, the Florents and the pyres at the beginning of the story, adding the negotiations between Stannis' new Hand and Lord Tywin behind Stannis' back, having some 'bonding time' with Gendry, Shireen, and Stannis, and ending the Dragonstone story with the leeches and Stannis' ominous declaration that 'one is not three', but that he will sacrifice Gendry if all the kings should die as prophesied.
Â 
Then there would no need for Stannis to go to Braavos in season 4, keeping the Iron Bank plot line for a later time.
Â 
Alternatively, it could have worked if a representative of the Iron Bank were present during Joff's wedding whose demands were later largely ignored/overheard due to the crisis after the king's death. We still have no idea what the fuck is going on between Tywin and the Iron Bank. Has he stopped the payment, as Cersei does later in the books, or has nothing of this sort happened yet? If so, what's the point in the necessary alliance with the Tyrells if they still alienate the Iron Bank by not using Tyrell money to pay the bank. And if they are still fulfilling the contract with the Iron Bank, Stannis should have no chance whatsoever to get a loan from the bank.
1927	Domonju	2014-05-08	I know this is off topic somewhat, but what resources do the Starks have? I always wondered how they made do in the middle of the North where it's always cold.
1928	Roose Boltons Pet Leech	2014-05-08	I know this is off topic somewhat, but what resources do the Starks have? I always wondered how they made do in the middle of the North where it's always cold.


Â 
- Wood. They have the largest forest in the Seven Kingdoms. And yet no shipbuilding industry.
- Some agriculture (otherwise there's no point in The Gift)
- The Manderly Silver mines.
- Fish.
1929	salmonsnake	2014-05-08	Probably not much resources in terms of trade and amassment of wealth, but crops grow there---perhaps different than, say, in the Reach, but adequate nonetheless. I also imagine the forests are full of game, the seas are rich with fish: keep in mind that Starks hold, or held rather, an enormous area of land stretching from the Wall to the Neck, and the loyalty of their vassals was of great magnitude. (Great distances and harsher conditions introduce a lack of scheming and intrigue, combined with the millenia-spanning legacy of the Starks as kings in the North). And overall, the land isn't utterly wretched and austere, it's simply Taiga, not the type of permafrost that lies beyond the Wall.
1930	Lord Varys	2014-05-08	According to Littlefinger in season 2 of the TV show, the Starks are the second most powerful house in troops after the Lannisters - which is of course nonsense in the books, but it that they are really very powerful in the show.
1931	Tixu Oty	2014-05-08	I seem to remember that wolf pelts coming from the Wolfswood are mentionned in the books.
1932	Domonju	2014-05-08	Cool. So it seems Starks have a nice stranglehold on renewable resources. Not only are they uber-cool but they're eco-friendly.Â
1933	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-08	Well, perhaps I made my point no clear enough:
Â 
TV Cersei is a completely erratic character. What's the point of her bonding time with Margaery in last week's episode if their last conversation ended with 'If you call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep'. I honestly don't get it.
Â 
It's the same with Tyrion-Cersei. Cersei loathes her brother because he has killed their mother at his birth, that has been established in season 2. But if that's the case, why the hell does Cersei spend her leisure time with Tyrion in season 3 after he has threatened to turn her joy to ashes in her mouth? They even bond over the whole forced/arranged marriage issue. She repeatedly visits him, talks to him, even drinks with him. I know that Lena and Peter are very good friends in real life, and this shows in their scenes together - there is just no real enmity/loathing between these two characters.
Â

Or did she just kill Robert because Ned threatened her life, Jaime's life, and the life of her children by telling her that he would tell Robert? TV Cersei never made a real grasp for power.

Â 
I try to understand the characters as D&D-characters now. They created them, they changed them to fit their vision - surely they have some sort of concept for each character.


Â 
i'll try to address your points best I can...
Â 
Regarding Cersei/Margery, that attempt at "bonding" was clearly a farce...it was her pathetic attempt at trying to win the Tyrell's (by proxy of Margery) vote in the trial against Tyrion. I will grant you that it does technically make more sense for her to go straight to Mace, but in the show it would have been extremely odd to suddenly give him some real on-screen time...if you watch it again, you will notice Margery's clear suspicion on her face...and the sister comment, just watch Margery's evil smirk while she says it and the way she checks Cersei's expression as she doesnt...i would say this is very on par with Cersei's character so far at believing she's the best manipulator and is capable of moulding anyone to do her bidding, directly or indirectly hence having her every whim/wish fulfilled ( i would say its her power/lust for power)Â 
Â 
Tyrion/Cersei...i would say there is extreme loathing/distrust between them...if you remember beginning of S2 when he arrives as hand of the king, horrible fights...despite everything, she does know he's cunning....so a lot of those scenes I remember seem to be Cersei battling her wits against Tyrion and trying to outsmart him (when she believes she captured Shae) which again I would say is again a power/ego trip..if you recall, she threatens him as well when Myrcella is being shipped off...something on the lines of "i hope you truly care about someone someday so i can take them away from you"...tyrion still hung out with her...
i think it was more a case of "keep your friends close and your enemies closer", they both met frequently to try to uncover each others plots and outsmart each other...now S3, do you remember Cersei's smug expression when tywin told him he has to marry sansa? Clearly the expression of someone who hated tyrion and firmly believes that she's outsmarted him again...then the other shoe falls and she realizes that her scheming backfired (you see the build up for the future here dont you?)...i will agree that book!cersei and book!tyrion would never have that bonding moment they did "which one of the 4 of us are more fukd?" i have no defense for that scene, only thing is that if you found that scene out of character for cersei, then same should be thought of tyrion as well...
Â 
i do believe that all she wants is power, do you recall the scene with LF? demonstrating her power just for the heck of it...show!cersei's motivations for killing robert seem to be a combination of her fear of robert finding out about her kids being jaime's bastards but ned did offer her the chance to flee, she threw it back in his face and decided to stay and kill the king, indicating a very strong lust of power. After jofferey is crowned, she does lord about for a short while till tyrion shows up, then she's distracted battling her wits against his...also, when she hits jofferey, he did manage to threaten her in a very creepy and effective manner...in her discussions with Tywin in S3 and S4 so far she seems to talking about how she deserves her daddy's respect and trust and so forth...while some unsullied might misunderstand that as just a girl trying to win her daddy's affection and attention, most that i've spoken to seem to think that she's under the impression that if she can win over Tywin, she's gona have a hell of a lot of weight/power to throw around...
Â 
so i guess im trying to say that show!cersei's motivations appear to be a strong lust for power and to be the queen bee, but she's quite easily distracted and definitely not as smart as she thinks she is...
Â 
this is all just IMO...one thing that your are probably aware off is that Lena Headly hasn't read the books at all...she goes by completely on the script and her interpretation and ofcourse discussions with D&D....
Â 
if you feel you got a different vibe from her, i would love to hear it...i'm planning another marathon 2-3 weeks after this season is over, i'll definitely try to watch for any points you bring upÂ
1934	RedShirt47	2014-05-08	meh, I don't see this as a major change. It brings the importance of the Tyrells and Iron Bank more into focus for the tv audience.
I don't see it changing Cersei's actions that much. The Crown should be servicing its debts out of its tax income, not out of Lannister mines. The crown should be getting taxes in from all seven kingdoms and from trade by merchants in and out of Westeros.
Cersei refusing to pay the Iron Bank should not be anything to do with Lannister's being broke or not. The Crown should be able to pay the Iron Bank regardless.
If in future it turns out that the Lannisters need to have lots of gold for some reason then they could always find a new rich vein of gold.

Â 


Â 
This is likely due to the Greyjoys. Â White Harbor is relatively new and Ironborn raids only recent stopped (before starting again).

Â 
Even more reason to build ships. With a decent navy you can stop the Ironborn before they arrive.
1937	Tim Thomason	2014-05-09	Â 
Even more reason to build ships. With a decent navy you can stop the Ironborn before they arrive.


They stopped building ships because a former King Brandon Stark went all crazy and destroyed all the ships.
Â 
I'm not sure how long that was before Aegon's Landing, but presumably the North never got around to building a naval culture again, and have survived on the political ties they held with the navies of the Night's Watch, the Vale, the rebuilt Iron Islands (before their recent craziness) and the Seven Kingdoms as a whole.
1938	Eddard the Builder	2014-06-12	"Gold-producing mines are possibly still productive in the hill."
Â 
Hmmm seems like this is hinted in a World of Ice and Fire.
1939	devilish	2014-07-24	There was no need of the Lannister's mines drying up nonsense.Â 
Â 
First of all why would the Lannisters pay for the Baratheon debts by themselves? Robert mismanagement created much of this debt without Tywin's consent. The Lannisters may have simply delegated the problem to the Iron bank instead of fueling an unreasonable debt all by themselves. Once Joffrey was made king Tywin hoped that he would be able to pay the iron bank by putting the weight on every region. Unfortunately he didn't anticipated this civil war.Â 
Â 
The Tyrells are needed irrespectively on whether the Lannisters need their wealth or not.Â 
Â 
1- The Tyrells has one of the biggest forces in Westeros. May we not forget that half of the Lannister forces was wiped up by Robb (when he captured Jaime)
2- They have borders with the Crownlands and the Westerlands which makes them very dangerous an unpredictable enemies to mess around
3- You may not notice but small folk do not eat gold. Just before the Tyrells reached Kingslanding the place was on the brink of revolt as food became scarce. The food basket of the 7 kingdoms sorted that issue out almost immediately.Â 
Â 
Cersei marriage with Loras made sense. The Tyrells were already stronger then the Lannisters at that point and were seeking ways (ex Sansa's marriage with Willas) to augment such power to a point where the Lannisters had no chance of ever catching up. With Tywin being old, half his army wiped out and no true heir with his brilliance on the horizon it was only fair for him to make as many ties with the Tyrells as possible.Â

1940	Newstar	2014-05-04	I'm transcribing the dialogue in the Jojen/Bran/Meera scene leading up to the burning hand, because it seems like it might be significant and yet another instance of the show spoiling the books.
Â 
Jojen: Meera and I, even Hodor...we're only here to guide you. He's waiting for you. You have to find it. YOU have to make it.
Bran: We will.
Jojen (to Bran): This...this isn't the end. Not for you. Not yet.
Meera: How...will we know the end?
Jojen (looking at his burning hand): You'll know.
Â 
"The end" in the context of the conversation seems to mean "death," and Meera is asking Jojen how they'll know "the end," which seems in context to mean when they'll die. That's when Jojen looks at his burning hand and says "You'll know."
Â 
Does this imply that Jojen dies by burning and thus put the Jojenpaste theory to bed permanently? Does it imply that Meera and/or Bran will die by burning, since Jojen sees the burning hand in reference to Meera's question "How will we [including Bran and herself] know the end?"? Does it imply something else?
Â 
ETA for correction.

1941	shiola	2014-05-04	Fire is inevitable in the battle against the White Walkers. Â Perhaps some or all of Bran & Co die during the big battle, and fire is involved in one of their deaths somehow? Â
1942	go joff go	2014-05-04	Honestly it . Was sufficiently vague and ambivalent not to be bothersome.  I was more interested in his vision of bran. Anyone notice how they framed the shot so when it was sunny bran was smiling and when it was dark he was not.
1943	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-05-04	Honestly it . Was sufficiently vague and ambivalent not to be bothersome. I was more interested in his vision of bran. Anyone notice how they framed the shot so when it was sunny bran was smiling and when it was dark he was not.


I agree, it was vague and ambiguous. A burning hand could have just symbolized anything shocking and unexpected. Although I don't think, if I remember correctly, that there is anything in the books thatÂ hint at seers also being impervious to fire, lol. Maybe Jojen is a Targaryen secretly. Maybe we are looking at the next King here.
1944	VeturKemur	2014-05-04	Jojen: Meera and I, you and Hodor...we're only here to guide you. He's waiting for you. You have to find it. YOU have to make it.
Bran: We will.


Am I the only one who found this line particularly odd? "Meera and I, you and Hodor" seems to suggest the four of them are there to guide Bran but that would include Bran himself, which doesn't make much sense in context with all the "you". It could be bad writing or I could be interpreting it entirely wrong but it sounded strange.

1946	Tyrion_is_Omar	2014-05-04	My interpretation was that Bran will become a tree. Hodor, Meera and Jojen will die in the road maybe because Â the dragons will burn all the lands beyond the wall.Â

1952	King Blackbeard	2014-05-04	I don't think this is the show spoiling the book.Â  Just the show trying to be cool.Â  I wonder how many Unsullied now believe that Jojen can summon fire out of his hands.

I think it is "even Hodor," on rewatch. His voice kind of catches on it, making it sound like "you and." I edited the OP.
1955	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-04	he will die by Dragon.

Â 
Really? To me, it sounds cute, like "yes, even Hodor has a role to play in helping you achieve your destiny".
1957	Daenerys Must Die	2014-05-05	Was waiting for a Jojenpaste reference while he was looking at his hand pre-burning vision..
1958	acosta	2014-05-05	All it made me think is Jojen will die in the north before the Others are defeated, so his body will need to be burned. He saw that just as he saw Karl's body being burned.Â
1959	Audrey Arryn	2014-05-05	My first thought was Jon and his burnt hand? I don't think Jon has anything to do with it though.Â I was just on the look out for R+L=J hints all episode, especially with the 'your Uncle Brandon' name drop...no Lyanna, though. 


I dont think the show are going to put any hints, I think they want it to be a shock to the viewers.
My only issue is there has been nothing to very little said of Rhaegar, one of my unsullied friends doesnt even know who Rhaegar is.
1960	The King Beyond The Wall	2014-05-05	I think the speech was directed at Bran. Now the simple explanation for the "fire" is that he saw Crasters Keep burning. But since the speech was directed at Bran it could mean that either Bran will end by fire or Bran might control fire (aka mount or warg a dragon) haven't seen anyone mention that yet.
Anyway I think fire in this scene symbolizes "Summer"... And Jojen's speech indicates that Bran will be the only survivor by the time "summer comes" or Bran will bring Summer back (ironic, since the motto of his house is "Winter is Coming").
1961	I'm_Tim	2014-05-05	The emphasis was in the now. Jojen knew they weren't going to die that night because he saw Karl burning.
1962	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-05-05	Clearly he's gonna get burned by Melisandre.
1963	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-05	Jojenpaste is not a thing. That was the first thing i thought. It looks like Jojen dies of illness and gets burned as to not become a wight. Hes seeing his own death.Â
1964	Alysanne Snow	2014-05-05	Jojenpaste is not a thing. That was the first thing i thought. It looks like Jojen dies of illness and gets burned as to not become a wight. Hes seeing his own death.Â 


Â 
I'd agree it's not a show thing, but I'm not sure if that says anything about the books as the two are branching off more and more. Â It seems like a difference they can work around and a minor enough plot point GRRM may just have forgotten to mention it. Â But yeah. Â In the show, I doubt he's paste.
1965	Red Wedding Cake	2014-05-05	I took the burning hand to be his vision of the burning Karl. Poor Karl...
1966	Kyrion	2014-05-05	Rewatch the scene people. Jojen was clearly talking about his own mortality. He was saying he didnt want to drink water because it doesnt matter, he knows hes toasted. Later Meera asked when would they know "the end"(meaning death), and Jojen saw himself basically deteriorating, and said they'll know.
Â 
Also, WATCH the interview Thomas did on Thronecast
Â 
https://www.youtube....h?v=wQLlWjSBT8E

He basically says Jojen will sacrifice himself to help Bran

1967	CandleWisps	2014-05-05	I personally am really fond JojenPaste, whether it is true/show!canon or not. For his burning hand though, my first and immediate interpretation was that he would sacrifice himself via JojenPaste (sorry if you don't like the theory), then the CotF would either burn his body so he couldn't become wightified, or he does become a wight and still ends up burned. If the fire is literal and not representative of something like Summer coming, then I hope Jojen's already dead and doesn't have to suffer being burned alive
1968	The King Beyond The Wall	2014-05-05	Fire = Cooked = Jojen Paste
1969	ohpooratlas	2014-05-05	Either Jojen dies and is burned so as not to become a white ...

Pfff. Sacrificing himself to help Bran could mean a whole bevy of things. It could mean he lets himself get eaten by wights so Bran can live. It could mean blocking a swing from an Other for Bran. It could mean aliens kidnap him instead of Bran. Why does it have to mean Jojenpaste?Â 
The Mel burning theory has some weight to it. If Mel finds that lot....D:

1972	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-05	First, the fire could be metaphorical. Visions and prophecies are like this, they're not literal.
Â 
Second, I doubt, if it is literal, that means he will be burnt to not turn into a wight. That wouldn't be a vision of his death. It's like having a vision of my dead being burnt and stay away from the fire all my life only to slip with a banana peel and get cremated.
1973	allie4645	2014-05-05	This has already been mentioned on this thread, but I wanted to second (or third) it. I'm pretty sure it was just a reference to Jon. Whether it was about Jon coming to save them immediately, or that Jon is end-game (which is what they were talking about) doesn't really matter. I think it was just a visual representing Jon's possibility of being AA/tPtwP, seeing as the show doesn't have much in the way of symbolism hinting at his parentage.
Â 
Or maybe the show writers thought it would look cool.Â  Â
1974	Brewmaster	2014-05-05	I think he was just seeing Craster's burning down later that night
1975	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-05	I've just realised I read the title of the thread like "in the burning heart".
Â 
And now you will too.
Â 
Jojen's burning hand
just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
an unquenchable thirst â<U+0099>«
1976	FalseSpring	2014-05-05	Jojen's actually a red priest and was looking through his fires, duh.
1977	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-05	My first thought went to "Oh shit, he'll become a wight". But I think that's too obvious of a scenario to be drawn from that imagery, that it's probably something else.
Â 
I like the idea of it alluding to a dragon.
1978	Epyon	2014-05-05	I took it a bit differently than you guys apparently....
Â 
When Meera asks him about how -they- will know it's the end, he looks at his hand on fire, and says that you'll know...
Â 
I took this to mean:
Â 
1. Jojen and Meera die together.
Â 
2. They die by way of fire, while alive, so they are aware of the fact that they are set on fireÂ  (IE not undead zombies)
Â 
3. By virtue of being burned to death, I don't think there will be anything to make a paste with, unless the ashes are mixed with paste...
1979	roxWolfox	2014-05-05	My first thought when seeing his hand aflame (through his own eyes, not the others ... the others couldn't see the flame) is that the size of the flame is an indication of his life essence ... his spirit if you will.Â  The greater the flame, the more life he has.Â  When the flame begins to decrease in size, it means his life force is becoming diminished.

1980	Envie	2014-05-05	I don't really see the show writers being that subtle as to allude to a metaphor in the burning hand. They've never made up stuff that vague before - usually they smack viewers over the head a few times with very literal 'hints' (such as fiddling with the necklace again to remind viewers the necklace was poison.
Â 
I think the burning hand is intended to be taken literally - Jojen has seen his own death and it's by fire. What that means is anybody's guess as this has moved way off into not written in the book territory and could very well be more reveal of material we've not read yet. I'm starting to get a little annoyed about it... not because I don't expect the show to eventually move on past where we are in the last book (it's inevitable that's going to happen at least moreso next season) ... but what's really peeving me is that we have absolutely NO idea which of these many bits and pieces are actual real stuff George has put into the story to come (which D&D know the basic story line to the end) and which bits and pieces they are pulling completely out of their collective asses and making up as they go along for "good tv" drama .... that's really pissing me off now.
Â 
I watch Jojen's hand burning and don't have a damn clue if that's something they just made up because it looks cool or if they're seriously spoiling events to come in the books.
1981	Newstar	2014-05-05	Well, Michelle MacLaren did say that the show would be moving beyond the books "more and more."
Â 
The burning hand isn't really that much of a spoiler if it strictly refers to Jojen's death, since we all knew Jojen was never going to die peacefully of old age, so if the burning hand alludes to Jojen's death, that it's by fire as opposed to something else isn't really that important, except for those who were super attached to the Jojenpaste theory, I guess.
Â 
If the burning hand refers to Meera's untimely death, on the other hand--and that is a possibility, as Jojen sees the burning hand in response to Meera's question "How will we know the end?"--then that is a big spoiler.
1982	Envie	2014-05-05	Yeah, see, that's the thing. We have no way of knowing which things at this point are spoilers and which things they're just making up because it's cool television drama. I am basically not taking ANYTHING happening from here on out (that didn't happen in the books) as any sort of defacto clues to the story. Nothing!
1983	binga	2014-05-05	The actor who played Jojen gave a hell of a performance today. It was the standout moment of the episode aside from Jon's little sword move.
1984	ricardoromell	2014-05-05	He says "i saw you die tonight, I saw your body burn .... I saw the snow fall and bury your bones" Did he just see those in the fire..He does not mention of dreams... He finished brans vision and was straing at his burning hand/hand on fire... Like Mel does .... if so this could mean the Other and Rhollor could well be one entity as discussed and debated before. could he use his own blood sacrifice/his blood of the first men to obtain those visions Â Â
1985	clawson24	2014-05-05	Â 
I heard it as "even Hodor", but I could be wrongÂ  
Â 
Â 
Â 
Yeah, that whole sunny weirwood/hill thing looks way less sinister than how I pictured it in the book


Â 
Probably because in the books it's described as being a cave under a massive forest of weirwoods, not just one lone one sitting on a hill.
1986	clawson24	2014-05-05	I think the speech was directed at Bran. Now the simple explanation for the "fire" is that he saw Crasters Keep burning. But since the speech was directed at Bran it could mean that either Bran will end by fire or Bran might control fire (aka mount or warg a dragon) haven't seen anyone mention that yet.
Anyway I think fire in this scene symbolizes "Summer"... And Jojen's speech indicates that Bran will be the only survivor by the time "summer comes" or Bran will bring Summer back (ironic, since the motto of his house is "Winter is Coming").


Â 
I definitely think the fire was specific to Jojen. I think he has already seen a vision of himself burning, and the way they portrayed that on the show was actually pretty cool. There's nothing to indicate in the books or the show to this point (to my knowledge) that Jojen knows how/when Bran will die.
1987	clawson24	2014-05-05	Well, Michelle MacLaren did say that the show would be moving beyond the books "more and more."
Â 
The burning hand isn't really that much of a spoiler if it strictly refers to Jojen's death, since we all knew Jojen was never going to die peacefully of old age, so if the burning hand alludes to Jojen's death, that it's by fire as opposed to something else isn't really that important, except for those who were super attached to the Jojenpaste theory, I guess.
Â 
If the burning hand refers to Meera's untimely death, on the other hand--and that is a possibility, as Jojen sees the burning hand in response to Meera's question "How will we know the end?"--then that is a big spoiler.


Â 
Notice though that in the vision he was having, he wasn't envisioning her burning, only himself.
1988	igrewupinKL	2014-05-05	i think eitherÂ 
1. the great weirwood will be burnt down along with jojen
2. jojen will be turned into a wight when he dies and thus burnt

1989	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-05	I dont think the show are going to put any hints, I think they want it to be a shock to the viewers.
My only issue is there has been nothing to very little said of Rhaegar, one of my unsullied friends doesnt even know who Rhaegar is.


Â 
Jon's true parentage is one of the biggest twists in the story.
Â 
I think they'll definitely build up Rhaegar and Lyanna's profiles before the R+L=J bomb is dropped. They'll need to if they want viewers to realise R+L=J is a BIG issue and Jon's parents are iconic/important people.
Â 
For book readers it is a massive shock/mystery so I can't see them not putting time into this plot line. It's pretty much the 'Luke, I am your father' of the story, making it more interesting and richer to the plot.
Â 
I'm betting they'll have Lyanna revealed as the KotLT at some point. That will put attention on her as far as 'historic'Â characters go. People will really dig the female beauty being a badass like her niece.
Â 
Rhaegar has had several mentions so far but nothing attention grabbing.

1990	MoIaF	2014-05-05	Personally, I interpret it as the end, as in the end of the War for Dawn.  
Last week the episode ended with one of Craster's son being turned into a Wights.  This week's episode ends with Craster's Keep being burned to the ground.  
It will end in fire.  IMHO
1991	salmonsnake	2014-05-05	Do I recall the books incorrectly, but wasn't Jojen's death supposed to be back at The Neck?
1992	Moon And Stars	2014-05-05	Jojen: Meera and I, even Hodor...we're only here to guide you. He's waiting for you. You have to find it. YOU have to make it.
Bran: We will.
Jojen (to Bran): This...this isn't the end. Not for you. Not yet.
Meera: How...will we know the end?
Jojen (looking at his burning hand): You'll know.

My immediate thought was Jojen will die sooner and they will have to burn him so he won't become a wight. Also Bran (and possibly Meera, if she isn't already gone) will meet dragons/dragonfire.
1993	Sun	2014-05-05	All it made me think is Jojen will die in the north before the Others are defeated, so his body will need to be burned. He saw that just as he saw Karl's body being burned.Â 


Â 
That's how I understand it. He is dying, and the burning hand is Jojen seeing his body burning in his funeral pyre. He knows he is dying and that he doesn't have long to go.Â 

					
					
							Edited by Sun, 05 May 2014 - 06:34 AM.
1994	Lord_Dustin	2014-05-05	I was very impressed with how Jojen was handled in this episode.
Â 
It is about time that we were given some exposition on the extent of Jojen's powers. Â I also took the burning hand to mean that he would die 'beyond the wall' and be burned after becoming a wight. Â I wouldn't be surprised if Jojen dies before season's end.
1995	Oberoth	2014-05-05	Thought it was meant to represent his life fire* dwindling. Though in retrospect it was probably just him seeing his death is near.
Â 
Â 
*thing used to make the shadowbaby
1996	The Drunkard	2014-05-05	I took it to mean Melisandre would be involved.Â She has a vision of Bloodraven and Bran in ADWD, thinking them the champions of the Great Other.Â 
Â 
If Jojen's death is going to be death by fire... well, Melisandre's the only one in the area known for killing people with fire, who also happens to think they're the enemy.
1997	Arkash	2014-05-05	Jojen's hand was the most curious moment of the episode ! Love reading all the spec here !
1998	Veltigar	2014-05-05	Â 



My first thought when seeing his hand aflame (through his own eyes, not the others ... the others couldn't see the flame) is that the size of the flame is an indication of his life essence ... his spirit if you will.Â  The greater the flame, the more life he has.Â  When the flame begins to decrease in size, it means his life force is becoming diminished.

Â 


I have a similar idea, although it's reversed in a way. I thought it signified the beginning of the end for him. His hand is burning and the more the fire spreads the less time he has left.
1999	Lord Damian	2014-05-05	I say Dragonfire. Lets face it, if Ser Barristan never gets around to setting Dany straight on her Dad, brother and what REALLY happened when the Targ dynasty was overthrown, then Dany will go on to destroy the userper's dogs whereever they may be.
2000	kishefmakherin	2014-05-05	I thought of Coldhands when Jojen sees his hand burn. So, I am betting on Jojen's blood in the paste or in Bran's enthroning ritual.
2001	Onna Lewyys	2014-05-05	Personally, I interpret it as the end, as in the end of the War for Dawn.

This. This. Jojen isn't referring to himself; he's referring to Bran's destiny.
"This...this isn't the end [of the journey]. Not for you [Bran]. Not yet."
"How...will we know the end [of Bran's journey]?"
"You'll know." [fire]
Bran is going to play a big role in the War for the Dawn, which will involve a lot of fire.

2003	Dildo_Baggins	2014-05-05	I don't think this is the show spoiling the book.Â  Just the show trying to be cool.Â  I wonder how many Unsullied now believe that Jojen can summon fire out of his hands.


Â lol Â how gullible of them
2004	CandleWisps	2014-05-05	Envie, I feel you on this. So much. The WW/Nights King reveal initially was exhilirating for me, before it was discovered he was the NK. I felt like an Unsullied, but now with all of these drops everywhere my head is spinning, sooo much turbulence. Trying to figure out whether these changes are book! Canon or not have me more frustrated for not being in the know and its driving me insane. At this point im more confused and erratic in regards to my Unsullied mom. These drops could or could not throw a huge wrench in already existing theories. This is downright painful for me
2005	Ankou	2014-05-05	Was waiting for a Jojenpaste reference while he was looking at his hand pre-burning vision..


Oh yeah sure, spam just starts leaking out of his hand.Â
2006	Dubbs	2014-05-05	I took it a bit differently than you guys apparently....
Â 
When Meera asks him about how -they- will know it's the end, he looks at his hand on fire, and says that you'll know...
Â 
I took this to mean:
Â 
1. Jojen and Meera die together.
Â 
2. They die by way of fire, while alive, so they are aware of the fact that they are set on fireÂ  (IE not undead zombies)
Â 
3. By virtue of being burned to death, I don't think there will be anything to make a paste with, unless the ashes are mixed with paste...


Â 
This is pretty much how I took it too. I think Jojen Paste may certainly be a thing in the book, but I don't know if it's going to happen in the show. When I saw that scene all I could think was Dragon Fire.. the way we said "you'll know" to me just felt like it was going to be a very obvious ending like that. Most likely while they are actually alive, and not wights.
2007	The Kinkslayer	2014-05-05	I agree, it was vague and ambiguous. A burning hand could have just symbolized anything shocking and unexpected. Although I don't think, if I remember correctly, that there is anything in the books thatÂ hint at seers also being impervious to fire, lol. Maybe Jojen is a Targaryen secretly. Maybe we are looking at the next King here. 


Â 
Jojen was the Prince that was promised, the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, and was hidden in Howlands's moving castle (powered by Calcifer, the lord o'light) to save him from the hordes of the Usurper.
Â 
But now that Jojen became paste, the PTWP prophecy will have its place next to the Stallion that mounts the world in Marwyn's Book of crappy prophecies

2008	Gwindor of Nargothrond	2014-05-05	I'd imagine the fire is metaphorical. Â Just like the sea coming to Winterfell, Snow overcoming Karl. Â Possibly death at the hands of a Targaryen or Melisandre.
2009	Stannis' shadow babies	2014-05-05	He says 'you' because he knows he's going to die before them. Fire maybe symbolizes the fact they'd need to burn him so he doesn't become a wight.
2010	AzorAhai42	2014-05-05	To me that fire represented Jojen's ability to see if he was going to die that day. Perhaps it's the (at the risk of sounding very cheesy) fire of his life? Or the light in him? And when that flame goes out, that's the day he will die?Â 
Â 
That was my first impression. Especially since Jojen has the ability (in the books anyway) to know that he is not going to die that day.
2011	Envie	2014-05-05	Envie, I feel you on this. So much. The WW/Nights King reveal initially was exhilirating for me, before it was discovered he was the NK.

Â 
Thanks for commiserating with me in misery over this issue. I don't think a lot of book fans here are giving this much thought, yet.Â 
Â 
Here's the biggest problem: Once we've watched this stuff on the show, we can't un-watch it. When George does finally get around to finishing the next book ... we will now rush forward into territory we have already 'seen' (to some extent or another) on the show and it's like going backwards down a one way street. He can say "The writers of the show took liberties with the story line and interpretation ... " and that's all fine and true but since it's ALL we have had to go on - of course many viewers are going to take it as canon and then be confused, pissed off or outright wrong about things once they read the book later on.Â 
Â 
This is why some of the debates I'm now seeing on these forum topics are starting to go wildly astray and turning into heated theorizing and crackpot territory. Now it's all up to interpretation and opinion... NOT book facts.
Â 
For years and years we've had the actual facts... the lore, right down to the page numbers and the quotes.Â 
Â 
We will no longer have that going forward next season at the earliest.
Â 
I think this forum is going to be a mess. People are going to refer to the show as 'fact' instead of the books and that's just plain wrong and... just a mess.
Â 
D&D are making shit up left and right. They are inventing entire characters and scenes that never happened. And while they are good drama, good television, I won't argue that - they did not happen.Â 
Â 
Now what?!Â 
Â 
I just feel like my interest in this forum as a place to sort out fact from fiction is slowly draining away.
2012	AZAXD	2014-05-05	Assuming it proves the Jojen paste theory wrong, the fire could mean he eventually becomes a wight and is burnt to finish him off or dies and is burnt to prevent turning. Or maybe the fire represents how hot Jojen gets during his seizures because he did look to be awfully run down and sweaty before and during Craster's. Maybe by the time they get to the great Weirwood this catches up with him. It seems sort of inevitable to me that the whole gang, aside from Bran, will get kind of lost and/or dead at the end of the journey...

2013	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-05-05	A little OT, but was anyone else bothered by the complete lack of a reaction shot of anyone else in the room?
Â 
There was the great scene back in S1 where Greatjon loses his finger to Grey Wind, and when everyone in the room starts laughing Bran has this 'WTF' look on his face which pretty much exhibits what the viewers are also thinking - these guys are freaking nuts!
Â 
Here was have Jojen's hand spontaneously combust and all we get in return is a smash cut to a different scene. Â Not the biggest deal in the world, obviously, but pretty characteristic of the show 'connecting' less and less as time goes on.
2014	Onna Lewyys	2014-05-05	You know his hand wasn't really on fire, right? It was a vision.
2015	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-05-05	You know his hand wasn't really on fire, right? It was a vision.


Oh...
Â 
 
Â 
Â 
EDT: My own idiocy aside, that makes Jojen's previous scenes much more interesting to me. Â I wonder what else he was 'seeing' while he was seemingly looking at other things whilst talking to Bran and Meera...

2016	Schokolade!	2014-05-05	I think the speech was directed at Bran. Now the simple explanation for the "fire" is that he saw Crasters Keep burning. But since the speech was directed at Bran it could mean that either Bran will end by fire or Bran might control fire (aka mount or warg a dragon) haven't seen anyone mention that yet.
Anyway I think fire in this scene symbolizes "Summer"... And Jojen's speech indicates that Bran will be the only survivor by the time "summer comes" or Bran will bring Summer back (ironic, since the motto of his house is "Winter is Coming").

I have to agree with you, I think you might be on to something here.
What I understood from Jojen speech is that Bran will out live them all... With him constantly repeating that it isn't the end of Bran. 
His hand burning was very ambiguous, it could mean many things.
The most plausible IMO is that Bran's journey will end with fire maybe he'll fight against Rhor'll or he'll wrag/mount a dragon (didn't the 3EC tell Bran in the books that he'll never walk again but he will fly?) 
Or it could mean that Jojen will die and they'll have to burn him
And as you said maybe he'll bring back summer Bran seems to be linked to summer a lot. Old Nan keeps calling him a child of summer if I remember correctly because he's born in summer and has never known winter or something like that? He also takes an awful lot of time to name his direwolf and ends up naming him summer, his house saying is winter is coming, the last book will be call "A dream of summer"... Coincidence?
2017	direwoofwoof	2014-05-05	I thought the burning hand referred to the immediate problem at hand (!) and Craster's burning that night.
Â 
Can someone direct me to the original thread about Jojenpaste? I remember reading it years ago when I read the book. What a theory!
2018	The Kinkslayer	2014-05-05	I'm the only one that expected Jojen to use his magic fire to free Hodor and unleash his wrath?
2019	roxWolfox	2014-05-05	Â

I have a similar idea, although it's reversed in a way. I thought it signified the beginning of the end for him. His hand is burning and the more the fire spreads the less time he has left.

Nice!Â Â  Â 
Either way, it was a very intriguing scene, and now every time he has screen time,Â  I'll be left wondering what else he sees that no one else can.Â
2020	Blazfemur	2014-05-05	Ok, being totally serial right now. totally serial.
Â 
Jojen's burning hand is, just liek the weirwood ont he hill, a vision.
Â 
If you notice, in these scenes and int he books, he's dying. Fever, burning up. Definitely a correlation there.
Â 
He wont die by fire, he wont die by dragonfire. He dies by fever, ironically enough, the closer they get to Bloodraven.
Â 
One could theorize the closer the get, the closer to death he gets.
Â 
But it's nothing mroe than a vision, this isn'tÂ a subject that needs 1100 posts and two threads. The fever in him, is burning him up, and getting stronger. He's heating up, and he knows the end is coming, he knows he's going to die.
Â 
That is all. What he saw is bittersweet, and he can probably predict the fever takes him at this point.

Lol we know it's a vision! But how do we know the vision is about him? I agree with you when you say Jojen will die of a fever it does look like this is what will kill him. Where I disagree is that the vision is of his own death because to me it came off as he was talking about Bran's journey and the role his companion will play rather then his/their death

This scene, though very well done on the actor's part was very misleading and vague. I think we all knew it was a vision of dying by fire but exactly who or what causes the fire (fever?) isn't really clear or if he's in fact talking about himself, Meera (who asks him) or all of them. It's purposely very vague. Color me annoyed that everything D&D writes from here going forward I am highly skeptical of because I don't know if they're drawing on real book facts or making it up for special effects and television drama!

"But how will we know,"
"Oh, you'll know" said Jojen, staring at his blatantly burning hand. He's blatantly telling them he's dying, in not so many words.

Allow me to quote myself:Jojen isn't referring to himself; he's referring to Bran's destiny.
"This...this isn't the end [of the journey]. Not for you [Bran]. Not yet."
"How...will we know the end [of Bran's journey]?"
"You'll know." [fire]

He was talking about Bran.
2026	Shebara	2014-05-05	ok lets add another crackpot here: Jojen is a secret Targaryen and Melisandre will burn him for the power in the kings blood
2027	Blazfemur	2014-05-05	Allow me to quote myself:
He was talking about Bran.


Â 
while referencing his journey, yes, youre right. As Jojen's dying (by fever, symbolized here, as flame), i take it, using your exact quotes, he's telling bran he'll know when his journey comes to an end, for the blatant visions he's seeing. Clearly Bran isnt having those visions, and thus, his journey isnt ending.
Â 
It's more of a warning, to me at least.

The pastel dragon, comes but once a year. And leaves a basket full of dragons eggs for all the good boys and girls of westeros. The twist of it is, in their sleep, the pastel dragon touches their cheek, and their eyes turn a fiery red, and they become targaryen.
Â 
Unfortunately, this makes westeros a targaryen nation.

I don't think their doing it only for shock value or at least I hope their not lol! 
This reminds me of an interview with GRRM when he said that Bran's story is the hardest to write not only because of how young the character is but also because he's the most rooted in magic.
And since D&D know how the books will end I trust they're taking a hint from GRRM and are thinking really carefully when they are writing Bran's scenes to make all his magic stuff coherent by the end. Nothing would piss me off more then if they mess it up
2032	Pure Guava	2014-05-05	Chiming in here just to say I interpreted the burning hand as a metaphor, and I doubt very much Jojenpaste is a thing. Why wouldn't the weirwood paste give him more power than Jojen?? That's just silly.

Â 
jojenpaste doesnt exist. it never did. it's a fan thing, and in no way supports the story. jojen had power, but certainly not all powerful. definitely not even a fraction, to what power a weirwood could unlock. i wouldnt buy into jojenpaste theory.

"But how will we know,"
"Oh, you'll know" said Jojen, staring at his blatantly burning hand. He's blatantly telling them he's dying, in not so many words.

Humm, I don't know I'm still skeptical, to me it didn't seem like Meera was asking about Jojen specifically but about the journey.
Jojen talking about his own death only works if he's not answering Meera's direct question.
 I think the problem is that we've read the books... If we hadn't read them then we wouldn't know that Jojen had a vision about his own death and knows exactly when it'll happen. 
So maybe because we've read the books we tend to assume this is what this vision was about but it seems odd to me that he wouldn't answer Meera's question at all.
2035	Aerys Vengeance	2014-05-05	My first thought of Jojen's burning hand was: "Does he predict the burning of the Tower of the Hand?" lol
2036	lostinwesteros	2014-05-05	What I understood from Jojen speech is that Bran will out live them all... With him constantly repeating that it isn't the end of Bran. 
His hand burning was very ambiguous, it could mean many things.
The most plausible IMO is that Bran's journey will end with fire maybe he'll fight against Rhor'll or he'll wrag/mount a dragon (didn't the 3EC tell Bran in the books that he'll never walk again but he will fly?) 
Or it could mean that Jojen will die and they'll have to burn him
And as you said maybe he'll bring back summer Bran seems to be linked to summer a lot. Old Nan keeps calling him a child of summer if I remember correctly because he's born in summer and has never known winter or something like that? He also takes an awful lot of time to name his direwolf and ends up naming him summer, his house saying is winter is coming, the last book will be call "A dream of summer"... Coincidence?
I think you're right on the mark here.  Think also of the rest of the dream that Bran had (when the 3EC told Bran about flying).  That whole dream chapter is one of the most significant in the series IMO (the Bran POV begins on p.160 in paperback version). Bran looks east, south, and across the Dothraki Sea, and what he sees moves increasingly beyond 'current events' until he finally looks north, beyond the wall.  "North and north and north he looked, to the curtain of light at the end of the world, and then beyond that curtain.  He looked deep, into the heart of winter, and then he cried out, afraid, and the heat of his tears burned on his cheeks.  'Now you know,' the crow whispered as it sat on his shoulder.  'Now you know why you must live.' ".  When Bran didn't understand and asked why, the crow had replied, 'Because winter is coming.'  When Bran then looked at the crow, he saw it had 3 eyes, "and the third eye was full of a terrible knowledge."  Etc, etc.  and it was just after this dream that Bran woke up and immediately knew his direwolf's name was Summer.  
Kudos, great post!
Yeah, Bran will be there right up to the end.

Â 
He's constantly sick, his skin is sweaty, he even seizured two episodes ago. He's dying. In the books, it's by fever. Fever is excessive heat, which was interpreted as fire. I may be wrong, but thats what I got from it. He knows hes dying, he can openly see it in his visions. Also, excessive fever can cause hallucinations. Maybe it wasnt even his greensight.
Â 
But it was, and it was his subconscious saying, "Ok, your time is running out, this is whats going to kill you" i.e. fever and burning up.

Â 
it would be one thing if jojen was fine, they met bloodraven, then he disappeared and then this mystical paste was in question.
Â 
He's constantly dying, it's already in process, pre-meeting Bloodraven.
Â 
The only connection between him dying and Bloodraven, is that he's getting sicker, the closer they get to him. This could be natural causes though, and it's not like they have medicine. Could be legit caught a fever, you never know.
2043	CandleWisps	2014-05-05	Â 
Thanks for commiserating with me in misery over this issue. I don't think a lot of book fans here are giving this much thought, yet.Â 
Â 
Here's the biggest problem: Once we've watched this stuff on the show, we can't un-watch it. When George does finally get around to finishing the next book ... we will now rush forward into territory we have already 'seen' (to some extent or another) on the show and it's like going backwards down a one way street. He can say "The writers of the show took liberties with the story line and interpretation ... " and that's all fine and true but since it's ALL we have had to go on - of course many viewers are going to take it as canon and then be confused, pissed off or outright wrong about things once they read the book later on.Â 
Â 
This is why some of the debates I'm now seeing on these forum topics are starting to go wildly astray and turning into heated theorizing and crackpot territory. Now it's all up to interpretation and opinion... NOT book facts.
Â 
For years and years we've had the actual facts... the lore, right down to the page numbers and the quotes.Â 
Â 
We will no longer have that going forward next season at the earliest.
Â 
I think this forum is going to be a mess. People are going to refer to the show as 'fact' instead of the books and that's just plain wrong and... just a mess.
Â 
D&D are making shit up left and right. They are inventing entire characters and scenes that never happened. And while they are good drama, good television, I won't argue that - they did not happen.Â 
Â 
Now what?!Â 
Â 
I just feel like my interest in this forum as a place to sort out fact from fiction is slowly draining away.


Â 
Precisely. I don't think people have entirely grasped the repurcussions coming just yet. We knew that we would be delving into unpublished material for awhile now, and for the past seasons we've known that D&D have had to consolidate/alter/erase certain plot lines for the sake of the on-screen interpretation, as well as added dramatic effect, but I don't think anyone was expecting so much to hit us so fast. I myself was expecting maybe two or three borderline spoilers from this season, and lot more next season, but we've, IMO, already been hit with major things that could potentially alter our perspective, like the Nights King (I have a problem even saying that given we don't know the textual context yet).
Â 
As far as I'm concerned, this entire forum will be a complete mess/utter chaos from here on out in certain regards. Literally everything will have to first read "well assuming what happened in so and so episode to so and so character is book!canon as well, then we can assume from this alteration in the storyline that A could be B and X could lead to Y". For strictly book readers this won't be a problem, but for those of us who watch the show too, like you said we cannot unsee it. Once that tidbit from the show gets stuck in our minds, its gonna be a complete battle of wills to try and separate canons from added drama/effect and strict book theories.
Â 
Personally, I like D&D and the show very much, and have felt that, for the most part, they have done a good job. There are others out there who could have done far worse, and at least we will always have the books if we want the first and essentail story. The fact that they add certain arcs and create additional drama to spice things up or move things along isn't necessarily what bothers me, it is necessary for some things that can't be adapted to the screen, limited budget, etc., what bothers me is not being able to categorize in my mind what is relevant to the books in the future and what is strictly the show!verse. My head just hurts trying to file away everything in my mind palace

Yup, being that his fever was what almost did him in as a kid to begin with. Idk last night I was thinking pretty much that the fire was literal, but I like it representing his fever a lot more

Well thank you 
Though I think Bran will out live them I'm not 100% certain he'll be alive in the last chapter of the last book, since GRRM loves to kill off Starks lol! And I can really see Bran dying after he accomplishes his destiny, whatever it may be (bringing back summer perhaps?) 
Oh yeah I didn't remember all the details of that chapter thanks for bringing it up! Now that you pointed it out there is no way that it's a coincidence! It's obviously foreshadowing, all the Starks siblings gave "cool" names to their direwolves without thinking to much about it but Bran... 
What are your taught about Melissandre's vision? She believes The 3RC to be working for the Other and Bran's to be his champion... I wonder what you think about it?
It's funny how most show fans believe that the north story lines are pointless and only the thrones matter when in fact the books tell us the throne is irrelevant in the bigger picture!

When Bran becomes BranRaven (with, or against his will), his body will be intact, even if true Bran is suppressed internally. I'm a firm believer Bloodraven takes his body, and gets carried out of that cave (Hodor unaware, all he sees is this Bloodraven's body die, and then Bran wanting to leave.

I also like the way D&D have done the show. It wouldn't be wildly popular after 4 seasons if they weren't doing a good job with the material and chosen actors. People on this forum are a little overly critical of both IMO.
Â 
But that still doesn't account for this strange black hole we're starting down. I'm already seeing it happen. Previously, when someone would make up a 'theory' about a certain character or story line - they would quote and reference bits from the book to support that theory and other readers would then respond back with argument for or against the theory based on other relevant bits from the books.Â 
Â 
But NOW... now we have the show. Book purists would argue it's irrelevant and totally separate from the books. But there's a collective of us sitting somewhere in the middle who think there's some validity to some of the hints being dropped in the show which may or may not be clues and actual facts in the story to come and it's leaving us feeling very uncertain of what we can really debate without just going off on tangents and 'crackpot' theories as someone else can simply shoot us down because "didn't happen" or "Did happen" doesn't exist going forward. We just do not know!
Â 
We're adding a layer to the confusion. Show writers adding stuff that wasn't there in the book, and may not be there in the future of the book. How does one make valid points and theories now?? Now everyone's going to just refute it and say it hasn't happened yet and we can't rely on the show to be canon knowledge.
Â 
The long long loooong thread (which got cut into two equally long ones) Lord Blazefemur is referring to is a valid point ... it went on and on and there was no real conclusion, no real theory that worked for anything about the Others because at the end of it all we only had one scene, with only a small bit of book knowledge previously given and nothing else to go on moving forward. The thread went off on tangents and arguments that had no real point. I fear most of the forum debates from here going forward will end up like that.

Imagine what a beautiful ending it would be with Bran's body dying and him escaping with Summer, as a friend in the back of his mind.
And last lines : Summer is coming.
Â 
Anyway, imo the fire of Jojen's hand means a lot of things ; his fever, the events that happend that night, the war against the Walkers, the Warrior of Light, Dragons or death by fire. Unless I am proved completely wrong and it has a precise meaning in the episodes to come.

Â 
Thanks, that was another reason I was scared of plunging in thereÂ  Â Â  With such an abundance of posts and repetition I was fairly certain it was just a cry in the dark, because no matter what a conclusion can't really be reached until all the seasons air and the last two books grace our hearts. At this point, all I see happening is everyone chasing shadows. These theories and abundance of uncertainties just seem to dance and swirl around us, tempting us into wanting to grab hold of one and make sense of this barrage of information, but shadows will, inevitably, slip through our fingers and laugh at us Â  
Â 
Please GRRM. I cry.
Â 
And Arkash, I can feel you here as well. The fire doesn't have to be representative of one single event/moment. We all know that fire should command a huge presence in the days and years to come, instrumental in the fight against the Great Other and beyond. It is after all A Song of Ice and Fire.
Â 
My only hope is that when Jojen finally goes, he goes somewhat peacefuuly. Thats a lot to ask of George, but I shall try and remain hopelessly optimistic that he doesn't die in agony Â

Actually that's a valid point! I don't know if you what GRRM's interviews or not but I remember that a fan asked him once if Bran's paralysis is mental rather then physical and if he'll ever walk again.
GRRM answer was very surprising because he did confirm that his paralysis was physical yet he refused to tell us if he'll walk again or not.
I taught it was strange since BloodRaven does tell Bran he'll never walk again...
How funny will it be if BloodRaven only purpose was to take over Bran's body!
Jon: Bran! It's been so long! You can walk it's a miracle!
BranRaven: yes, yes, I heals while I was north... Who are you?
Jon: it's me Jon, you're brother! You probably don't recognize me because it's been so long since we last saw each other.
BranRaven: Yes... That's probably it! Tell me Jon, now that Robb is dead I AM king of the north right?
Jon: Totally!
BranRaven: Excellent!!

Imagine what a beautiful ending it would be with Bran's body dying and him escaping with Summer, as a friend in the back of his mind.
And last lines : Summer is coming.
Â 
Anyway, imo the fire of Jojen's hand means a lot of things ; his fever, the events that happend that night, the war against the Walkers, the Warrior of Light, Dragons or death by fire. Unless I am proved completely wrong and it has a precise meaning in the episodes to come.

Oh! I've never taught of that! I agree it could be very poetic
As for Jojen's vision it could mean so many things but I'm starting to think it's about Rhor'll after all Melissandre does burn a lot of people in his name and he seems to be represented by fire.
Now with that said I don't believe Jojen will die in flames but that there will be a confrontation with Rhor'll/the Others

Once the iron throne is destroyed, and the realm is made into 7 kingdoms again, BranRaven will either rule as King In The North through Winterfell, or rule in Summerhall based on the obvious, if my theories prove true.

2059	evita mgfs	2014-05-05	Jojenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s burning hand refers to how the Leaf will subdue the Â wights gathered at the Cave of Skulls so that the companions can enter safely.Â  It is when the wights are alit that their â<U+0080><U+009C>journeyâ<U+0080><U+009D> will end.
Â 
Fire and light often symbolize â<U+0080><U+009C>enlightenmentâ<U+0080><U+009D> or â<U+0080><U+009C>knowledgeâ<U+0080><U+009D>, and Jojen with his greendreams is certainly enlightened.
Â 
I never believed in Jojen paste because it would violate the laws of hospitality.
Â 
If the television series aligns with novel elements, then obviously Bran can enter the weirwood without the benefit of ww paste.Â  He has done so on the show.
2060	Blazfemur	2014-05-05	Â 
He'll probably spend the rest of his days murmuring "amatuers" under his breath. Btw where have you posted this theory? My interest has been piqued


Â 
Ive posted it all over the place, but the basis of my theory is this:
Â 
from the moment you even meet bloodraven, what do you see? You see an older gentlement, on a chair, with weirwood roots growing in and among him to power him.
Â 
I see, a corpse long since dead, but still very much alive (he's what, exceeding 130 y/o or of the like at this point). I see him chained, and imprisoned, to that throne. As a corpse, i see him bound in that cave, since no undead can enter, it can also be understood, that no undead could leave (i.e., a barrier of sorts).
Â 
I see the weirwood roots, that entangle his body, as a form of imprisonment. Bloodraven was put in that cave, he didnt go there. Whether or not whomever did this knew the full extent of Bloodraven's power, we dont know.
Â 
Now, all that being said, Bloodraven is connected via his powers to wierwood and thus can see past the cave he's held in. The question of, well, why did he go to Bran in his dreams, why would he just get up and go to Bran, why did a crippled boy, on the back of the simpleton, have to go to him. It makes sense, that that was the extent of his powers, to contact Bran through dreams, if his body was imprisoned in that weirwood.
Â 
So Bran sees his visions, collects Hodor, Jojen, and Meera, and heads off to see the three eyed crow beyond the Wall. Much to Bloodraven's appeal. This is his way of finally getting out of that cave. They arrive, and Bloodraven begins teaching Bran how to use his powers. Why? And questioning my theory, why pick a crippled boy, when Hodor is huge and monstrous if utilized the right way.
Â 
Well, let's use a Star Wars analogy since May The 4th just happened. If Yoda were to die, and he were to possess someone. Would he possess, Luke Skywalker, who he's trained and is much more akin to "the force," or woud Yoda possess Chewbacca, the giatn monstrous ferocity he is. Clearly, Yoda possesses Luke Skywalker to enhance the abilities he's training him to use.
Â 
The same goes for "Why not just possess Bran immediately?" He's opening Bran's eyes, making him stronger. Perhaps, making him stronger, and preppingÂ his body and mind to accept such a sorcerous power that is Bloodraven. He finally got him here, and he's finally going to use that to get out. Remember, why is Bloodraven sitting in that chair, why hasn't he stood up, and why hasnt he left that cave to meet Bran closer to Bran's former habitat. Bran, Jojen, Meera, they never did ask Bloodraven ow he got to that cave, why he left society to get there, and why he has weirwood roots growing throughout his body.
Â 
Now, it's up for debate whether or not Coldhands worked with Bloodraven to get them there, them both being members of the Nights Watch. It's up for debate whether Coldhands was helping Bran, or if he was serving a master waiting to be released. With all the powers Bloodraven has, it would make sense if he was "a horror locked away from the world and never to be seen again." Such power to be sealed, not destroyed, if he can be destroyed. Death certainly hasnt claimed him, and he's as conscious as Coldhands is. But that's all heresay, much like this theory in general.
Â 
I think it would make for more interesting storytelling, if Bloodraven possesses Bran, and gets unleashed upon the world again. He's openly dead, due to age and deterioration. If theres a wall preventing the dead from entering, it would be logical to assume, that wall is still there and keeping the dead from crossing to leave.
Â 
If Bloodraven were to warg Bran against his will, which, the story has made a point to make it an "abomination" whenever Bran wargs into Hodor (he says Hodor struggles him, but then hides himself deep within), then Bloodraven would have a living vessel, and could leave the cave.
Â 
Still, Bran cant walk, despite his newly acclaimed powers (and then, enhanced, by Bloodraven's). The idea would be, suddenly, Bloodraven's existence seemingly just dies completely, as his spirit wargs into Bran's body. The only people left to convince are the simpleminded Hodor who wouldnt realize it anyway, and, the tough part, Meera. Jojen has since died, so if there was any "sensing" of Bran being false, it would have died with him since it appears Meera has no real powers at all (aside from her warrior/hunting abilities).
Â 
And there you have it. Once Bran is capable enough to handle the immensity that is Bloodraven (through 'training'), Bloodraven wargs Bran, Branraven orders Hodor to pick him up, and him, Hodor, and Meera leave the cave, passing throught he barrier that keeps dead out, and dead in. Bloodraven is free, and unleashed once again to do whatever the fuck he wants.
Â 
Now, he might not need Bran after passing that threshhold. After they cross, I would think Bloodraven could exist to possess anyone after that, even now, the stronger, more endurant Hodor, until he gets somewhere to get someone better. He may use Bran's body for his influence though, I'd like to think. Besides, if it's weirwood that kept him there on that throne, there's a weirwood door beneath the Nightfort. Same concept, but this time, he'd need to posses one of the Night's Watch to pass through it.
Â 
Or... I could be wrong.
Â 
Bloodraven: Ok Bran, ive taught you allÂ you need to know, i wish you luck.
Bran: Ok Brynden. See you around!
Bloodraven: *stays put, and lets events unfold as they do, with zero interference.*
Â 
Kinda boring if Bloodraven is just a good guy there to teach Bran and that's it, isnt it?
2061	TheHouseHB	2014-05-05	Was Bran warging Hodor and killing Locke a foreshadowing of Bran Warging Theon and using him to kill people at Winterfell during the Ghost of Winterfell chapter?

2063	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-05	He says "i saw you die tonight, I saw your body burn .... I saw the snow fall and bury your bones" Did he just see those in the fire..He does not mention of dreams... He finished brans vision and was straing at his burning hand/hand on fire... Like Mel does .... if so this could mean the Other and Rhollor could well be one entity as discussed and debated before. could he use his own blood sacrifice/his blood of the first men to obtain those visions Â Â 


Â 
I took it as "Jon Snow is coming for you".
2064	Dreams Of Spring	2014-05-05	I took Jojen's hand burning as a sign of what was going to happen to Craster's Keep and to the mutineers, I didn't see it as being related to Jojen or Bran. Just my impression.

Hmm. That is indeed one I haven't heard. Not 100% sold on it yet, but you do make a compelling argument and bring valid points to light. I can think of other reasons for some of the points you made, but it is still a plausible, well rounded theory Â Â  Bloodraven has always been one of my faves, I'll have to mull over this awhile
2069	evita mgfs	2014-05-05	The Bran skinchanging with Theon is an "old" Theory that has been analyzed in many threads - or predicted.
Â 
If Bran skinchanges another "human", I doubt "Theon" is his best option:Â  Theon is despised by many and he is near as crippled as Bran with so many toes missing.Â  Not a good skinchanging option.

Whether Bloodraven is evil now or not, I'm not convinced he was evil during his Kings Landing days. People saw what they wanted to see in him, and chose to perceive some of his actions rather harshly IMO. So what his end game is idk, but I still don't think he was ever evil

But in regards to Jojen's hand, i think it was his inner powers letting him know hes in trouble, and internally, he's burning up at a result of the fever that will inevitably kill him
2074	FalseSpring	2014-05-05	Couldnt BR just warg into anyone standing in front of a Wierwood tree? If he can just warg from person to person, couldn't he have given visions to a wildling to bring them to the cave, warged into a wildling, into a NW member, into Tyrion when he visited the nights watch, and then into Joffrey when Tyrion saw Joffrey? Joffraven!
Â 
I do think BR/CoTF aren't as nice and cuddly as they seem, but I don't think Bloodraven wants to be Bran, Stark or not. And if BR really knew everything about Jon's parentage, (assuming L+R), wouldnt it be better to come to visions in Jon's mind and bring him to the cave during a ranging? Even if Jon isn't a Targ, BR probably knows Robb legitimized him. BR could warg into the king of the north instead of the crippled prince of the north.
As far as what BR's agenda is .. I dont know. But for some reason I feel like he's content in that cave, and being all knowing.

Â 
The weirwood tree appears at this point to be just a gateway into seeing, a gateway into knowing. The spirit woul dneed to break through the weirwood bark and it just fully supports my theory that while you can see as a weirwood, you cannot teleport and break through it, and appear on the other side.
Â 
His warging abilities so far, further bolstering the theory of the barrier, have not left the confines of the cave. His knowledge of seeing through weirwood is there, connecting through the roots entangled on his body -- but has he ever warged anything outside the barrier that has been on that cave?
Â 
no, he hasnt. his forms, were in dream form only. His presence never left that cave, and he's never warged anything beyond it's entrance.
Â 
My theory stands, still.
Â 
By all means, if you feel i am wrong, id liek to be proven so. Name one being, or animal, that was confirmed as Bloodraven and disproves that his abilities are limited to that cave. Again, dreams set aside because he's technically a Targaryen with Targaryen assumed prophetic dreams, including possibly enhanced by sorcery. I'm talking literally, his spirit leaving that cave and possessing another form.
Â 
He sees through weirwood due to the roots he's connected to. But he hasnt left the weirwood roots/trees, has he?

He's prepping, priming Bran. If he's dead, then it's a dead spirit, looking to take over a living body through means of warging.

Bran's ability to do so is a gift unique to his powers.Â  Case in point:Â  V6S's failed attempt to skinchange Thistle.


Â 
and why is that? How did he fail? She fought him internally, they struggled, and if i recall correctly, she died.
Â 
perhaps like the other corpses strewn about the cave.

im hellbent and determined on this, it all adds up, and im calling out the twist at the end of next season
2082	StrollofShame	2014-05-05	Jojenpaste is not a thing. That was the first thing i thought. It looks like Jojen dies of illness and gets burned as to not become a wight. Hes seeing his own death.Â
2083	The Dragon has three heads	2014-05-05	"You're not here" was IMO the most interesting part.
Added to the "the raven is you" could mean a lot about bran being time lord bran.
2084	StrollofShame	2014-05-05	What Florina said about Jojenpaste not being a thing, & the boy seeing only his own death & burning--absolutely!

Almost chilling, how that line, foreshadows my theory.
2087	Moon-Pale Maiden	2014-05-05	This. This. Jojen isn't referring to himself; he's referring to Bran's destiny.
"This...this isn't the end [of the journey]. Not for you [Bran]. Not yet."
"How...will we know the end [of Bran's journey]?"
"You'll know." [fire]
Bran is going to play a big role in the War for the Dawn, which will involve a lot of fire.


Â 
Perhaps this refers to what happens when Bran and co make it to the cave and battle all the wights. Â The survive that battle because of fire. Â If we take that to mean the end of Bran's journey, then his journey ends with fire - the fire in the great battle against the wights to get to the 3 eyed crow/raven. Â Maybe?

I am not discounting your premise - one greenseer skinchanging with another- may or may not influence the "take-over".Â  My crazy, crackpot theory revolved around Jon's death and BR.Â  So much had been made on threads about how if Jon's body dies, this and that force will reanimate him - but that in order for this magic to work, there is a cost.Â  Only death pays for life.Â  The consensus for the life paying for death is Ghost - everyone seems to want Ghost to die!Â  Well, I will not go into my entire theory about Ghost, but it does not involve his death.Â  No - I toyed with the idea that BR would "give" what life he has left as a gift so that Jon may live.
Â 
But that is one of my silly ideas - I am sharing it so that you understand that I seldom ever "rain" on someone else's ideas.Â  I am merely hoping that BR and the Children do not mean to harm Bran.

It's all good, no offense given, and none taken.
Â 
Now this is full crack pottery, then again, i do speak only in blasphemies:
Â 
Jon dies, out of respect, they lay him out, his longclaw in his arms as they often do.
Melisandre, sacrifices Craster's baby, not the king-beyond-the-wall's baby (since sam and gilly took the wrong baby)
Since that baby belonged to the Others, there is some, Other, intervention in the sacrifice.
Jon opens his eyes, his glowing, blue eyes.
Jon sits up, longclaw in his gloved hands
Jon stabs Melisandre with Longclaw
Based on Melisandre's element, warm body, fiery personality, and jons opposite, the blade spark during the stab, and takes flame, with her blood.
Jon, The Other, is reborn, with a flaming sword...
Â 
Now thats NEVER going to happen. I dont support that theory at all, its openly crackpot. But, it makes sense.

2091	binga	2014-05-05	Fire could symbolize or suggest practically anything depending on how you want to interpret it.
2092	Toft	2014-05-06	We may not have to wait for too long to find out what this burning hand symbolises.
Â 
The show has continually deferred things until slightly before they matter, whereas the books have seeds sown for decades.
Â 
Where do you think this series will end when it comes to Bran's storyline? Do you think they will leave his journey... "incomplete"? We might find out a bit more about Jojen's fate sooner than we think, if the burning hand references an event due to take place in this series.
Â 
In my view, Jojen is a sacrificial character who understands precisely the role he must play, and the last Bran chapter is so sinister that it would be absurd to deny the possibility of awful things going on in the background.
Â 
I must say, the way the Hodor warging was portrayed was perfect. Then there was a line along the lines of "Who could do such a thing to a man?" - well, Bran did. So judge and read.
Â 
Anyway, I'm really enjoying the TV series. It is fantastic.

Just curious, but when you say series are you referring to the season? Cuz I know some places other than the US address seasons as series, so I was wondering if that's what you meant because the context would make much more sense

Haha no need to apologize, I was just clarifying that I understood your question correctlyÂ  Â  And to answer your question, I hope we don't find out too soon. Brodie-Sangster is a great actor, and I would hate to see him go so quickly. But if he doesn't end up serving any other purpose than to get Bran to Bloodraven and ultimately sacrifice himself (or die of fever), it would make sense that they kill him off by the end of the season, assuming they're gonna be dropping more Unsullied things on us. Bran's last chapter was indeed sinister and doesn't bode well. Personally, I always hoped Jojen would have a bit more of a role to play, he is such a fascinating character. I would say he's not gonna be killed off, but at this point its really impossible to tellÂ Â Â

Â 
It's precisely the ambiguity of it all that I'm enjoying. Awaiting the gusts of The Winds of Winter may take years - but we have hints of what may come and can still enjoy this world and speculate on where this is all leading right now. I posted a few days ago about whether I would choose to ignore the TV series in favour of the books. But I just can't. The imagination behind the two is the same. I've decided now. I am going to continue with the TV series even if it goes further than the books and I don't for one instant think it will diminish the quality of the prose I enjoy when the books are completed.
Â 
To return to the topic of the thread, the burning hand is mysterious but it's wrong to use it as a means to discredit inferences concerning Jojen's blood. Blood magic. Scythes in the sky. Characters mumbling about death not being today but not managing to mumble such words recently. Jojen awaits a hideous fate and he knows it.
Â 
Also, I think the idea of Bran becoming a tree is quite beautiful. I'd happily be a tree if it meant I could see the world as it was and as it will be, and also get to warg a dragon.
2097	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-06	Would have been funny if instead of a burning hand Jojen just saw a bowl of oatmeal.
2098	Toft	2014-05-06	Would have been funny if instead of a burning hand Jojen just saw a bowl of oatmeal.


Â 
There's a "Report" button which I could use to signal that this remark is distasteful ;-) While being drained of blood to channel some power into a cripple, of course, wouldn't be at all so.
2099	When Harry met Sansa	2014-05-06	I posted in the Episode thread that I thought this might mean that Jojen is killed by Mel, either by sacrificing himself for Bran's cause or by being captured and sacrificed by Mel. We know that Mel has seen Bran, BR and co. in her flames and thinks that they represent servants of the Great Other.
Â 
However, the more I think about it the more it makes sense that regardless of how Jojen dies, and illness is certainly extremely likely, he sees his hand burning because his body will be burned so as to not become a wight. I think that makes more sense than anything else. I'm still not even 100% convinced Dany ever makes it beyond the Wall so I can't get on board the dragon theory, though it does have some merit.Â
2100	binga	2014-05-06	The bones in Bloodraven's cave, were any of them burned?
2101	salmonsnake	2014-05-06	The bones in Bloodraven's cave, were any of them burned?Weren't they animal bones? Birds and such. And I recall Coldhands saying the cave is 'warded' so I assume it's the same kind of thing that wards the Wall
2102	MrsManderly	2014-05-06	Whatever it means, it seems to make the Jojenpaste theory that much less likely -- ho hum, another of my pet theories bites the dust!
2103	jabulaniman	2014-05-06	Am I the only one who found this line particularly odd? "Meera and I, you and Hodor" seems to suggest the four of them are there to guide Bran but that would include Bran himself, which doesn't make much sense in context with all the "you". It could be bad writing or I could be interpreting it entirely wrong but it sounded strange.

He said "Meera and I, EVEN Hodor" not "you and".
2104	Monk Meth-	2014-05-06	i think he was seeing the mutineers burning.
2105	Bastard of the Dreadfort	2014-05-06	Regardless of the burning hand, what I've been wondering is why does Jojen always look so sickly and pale? Is he already actually dying of some illness? Did they suggest something in the show that I've already missed?
2106	Wicked Woodpecker of West	2014-05-06	Maybe book!Jojen will be turned into paste, but screenwriters said "Hey! we cannot make cute, shamanic, native children of the forest Redd-eaters! Let's whitewash them!".
So TV!Jojen will be turned into wight and burned. Just so.
2107	Chebyshov	2014-05-06	Regardless of the burning hand, what I've been wondering is why does Jojen always look so sickly and pale? Is he already actually dying of some illness? Did they suggest something in the show that I've already missed?


Â 
There was nothing really suggested, but we know he's prone to fits so I guess you can just assume he's not exactly made from hearty stock. He has a rough go of it North of the Wall in the books too; I think they're just starting to show his deterioration.
2108	Hard Hugh	2014-05-06	I'm transcribing the dialogue in the Jojen/Bran/Meera scene leading up to the burning hand, because it seems like it might be significant and yet another instance of the show spoiling the books.
Â 
Jojen: Meera and I, even Hodor...we're only here to guide you. He's waiting for you. You have to find it. YOU have to make it.
Bran: We will.
Jojen (to Bran): This...this isn't the end. Not for you. Not yet.
Meera: How...will we know the end?
Jojen (looking at his burning hand): You'll know.
Â 
"The end" in the context of the conversation seems to mean "death," and Meera is asking Jojen how they'll know "the end," which seems in context to mean when they'll die. That's when Jojen looks at his burning hand and says "You'll know."
Â 
Does this imply that Jojen dies by burning and thus put the Jojenpaste theory to bed permanently? Does it imply that Meera and/or Bran will die by burning, since Jojen sees the burning hand in reference to Meera's question "How will we [including Bran and herself] know the end?"? Does it imply something else?
Â 
ETA for correction.


Â 
Well they may have cooked the paste  Rendered him into a nice reduction Jojensauce. Don't you watch Hannibal too?
2109	Tixu Oty	2014-05-06	I think the burning hand is intended to be taken literally - Jojen has seen his own death and it's by fire.
[snip]
I watch Jojen's hand burning and don't have a damn clue if that's something they just made up because it looks cool or if they're seriously spoiling events to come in the books.


Â 
I haven't watched the last two episodes with my unsullied sis yet, and as I was watching on my own I was imagining in my head all the questions she might ask me and I realized for most of them my answer would have to be: you know, at this point, we're pretty much on the same level and I don't know any better than you, because the show's getting close to catching up to the books, and it's adding lots of stuff in there that could be either foreshadowing or made-up stuff. So I'm like her, I don't have a clue, and I love it!
Â 


Do I recall the books incorrectly, but wasn't Jojen's death supposed to be back at The Neck?


Â 
Hmm yes there was a vague quote from Jojen to Meera that could be interpreted in a number a ways. I don't remember exactly what he told her, but I basically took it to mean that 1/He wasn't going to die right away 2/Possibly not until it's time to start going back home 3/and that he'd never make it back home anyway.
Â 


What I understood from Jojen speech is that Bran will out live them all... With him constantly repeating that it isn't the end of Bran.
His hand burning was very ambiguous, it could mean many things.


Â 
This whole conversation was so incredibly vague and confusing, we don't know who is talking about what, totally surreal. Yes it's meant to be ambiguous. I think show only people are supposed to wonder what the hell that's all about, and then when Karl is killed and the keep is burned they can think back on it and interpret it as Jojen predicting the bad guys' end. First layer. Then I guess somewhere down the line, something happens to Jojen or to Team Bran and we're meant to think back on it again and see the double meaning. Second layer. I love it.
So for that second layer, as a book reader, the first thing that came to my mind was: this is how Jojen dies. I thought this because the fact that Jojen knows how and when he will die was incredibly tense and sad, it's a huge part of what makes the character compelling, and all of team Bran's journey too. You guys have incredible theory, but I guess I'll stick to that. It's the most obvious interpretation I think, especially since the show has otherwise done a great job at letting us know that Jojen's time may be almost up. See below.
Â 


Finally!!! Someone else thinks Jojen's paste is bullshit!! I don't know why most fans I've ever talked to before always acted like this THEORY is book canon!


Â 
I don't think Jojenpaste is true in the books, and it's starting to look like it's even less likely to be true in the show. But, I think the theory still makes a lot of sense because: 1/ we know for a fact Jojen is going to die before all is said and done, and knowing that, we stress out wondering when is the day Jojen dies. 2/ That last Bran chapter was incredibly weird and dark, even more so than his previous chapter in the caves. Add to that the fact that the Reed siblings were nowhere to be seen which is definitely very weird. I think something very wrong might be going on, but it's not the Jojenpaste. It's just a feeling though. Nothing to prove or disprove anything.
Â 


It's funny how most show fans believe that the north story lines are pointless and only the thrones matter when in fact the books tell us the throne is irrelevant in the bigger picture!


Â 
Yes! I love that! And that's why the last episode REALLY surprised me a lot. I mean, the previous episode already upped the magic quite a bit with the White Walkers and baby scene. But now, they are breaking their own laws. The show had gotten us used to the fact that is was pretty low on magic compared to the books. Apart from Bran, none of the Stark siblings warg or have crazy dreams. There are no flashback scenes at all, even when it doesn't involve magic. It's a pretty straightforward tale with no visual tricks to give it a fantasy look. But in that scene, we had the tree appearing out of nowhere in the background, while all characters were awake. That was a first! And then there's the burning hand. Previous posters have said that in future scenes they wonder what else Jojen might be seeing that we don't know of, and that's telling, because obviously, he's been seeing things all the time, but now D&D are choosing to show us. Wow! I'm thrilled because it looks like the show is definitely taking a new direction.
Â 


"You're not here" was IMO the most interesting part.
Added to the "the raven is you" could mean a lot about bran being time lord bran.


Â 
Yes! I was wondering what the hell does that mean. And I still have no idea but I have faith in D&D and I think, come on, this gotta be a clue, right?
Â 


In my view, Jojen is a sacrificial character who understands precisely the role he must play, and the last Bran chapter is so sinister that it would be absurd to deny the possibility of awful things going on in the background.


Â 
I agree. That scene and the weird ominous dialogue talking about ends and whatnot was definitely foreboding and getting us ready for things to go wrong.
Â 


Regardless of the burning hand, what I've been wondering is why does Jojen always look so sickly and pale? Is he already actually dying of some illness? Did they suggest something in the show that I've already missed?


Â 
You know, iirc I don't even think Jojen has fits of epilepsy in the book, right? I took the epilepsy and the feverish look as a visual hint that Jojen's death is near. It works just so much better to have him always looking sickly right from the start than to simply have him talk about him knowing the manner of his death. I love when movies or shows give you subtle visual hints to make you process things without even being aware of it.
2110	ChildoftheTropicalForest	2014-05-06	Agreeing with Acosta here.Â  My interpretation is that he will die after his mission to the North is completed and body burned to prevent it from becoming wighted.
2111	Recentiy03	2014-05-06	This. This. Jojen isn't referring to himself; he's referring to Bran's destiny.
"This...this isn't the end [of the journey]. Not for you [Bran]. Not yet."
"How...will we know the end [of Bran's journey]?"
"You'll know." [fire]
Bran is going to play a big role in the War for the Dawn, which will involve a lot of fire.


Â 
Sounds like the most reasonable explanation so far, I tend to agree.Â
2112	binga	2014-05-06	It's a veryÂ tricky discussion between the three of them. Jojen seems to be hinting at his ownÂ death but Bran's survival. Meera asks about the end but it is not clear that she is asking about Bran's end or the end in general. Jojen responds to her but he is seeing his own hand on fire, there is no direct connection to Bran and Meera.The words on paper don't match up with how it goes down on screen. Either this is brilliant writing and planning on the part of the creators or they were very sloppy with the scene.

I watch the show with my unsullied dad and the same thing occurred to me. I must agree, it's really exciting! It's actually helping me come to terms with the show potentially surpassing the books (although I still hope it doesn't).

I would love to read to books first, but if that doesn't happen, at least now there are more people that I can theorize with. I mean before, my sis would make predictions or observations and I'd just have to keep my mouth shut. Now we can make predictions together.

Â 
Yes, Jojen was always a bit sickly from the start and he got sicker as the journey north progressed so they are potraying it correctly in the show with his character.Â 
Â 
As for all the wild speculation about Jojen dying once they reach the caves ... Â Â I think a lot of people are forgetting some parts of Jojen's own self- prophecy as was outlined in the book in favor of show-theories. Here it is from the wiki - I'm sure it could be directly quoted from ADWD as well:
Â 
Â 

	A Dance with Dragons
Jojen,Â Bran,Â Meera,Â Hodor, andÂ ColdhandsÂ travel north of theÂ WallÂ in search of theÂ three-eyed crow.[13]Â They reach theÂ cave of the three-eyed crow, but are ambushed byÂ wightsÂ just outside the caveâ<U+0080><U+0099>s entrance. Because Jojen is too weak to continue, Meera carries him on her back. Inside the cave, the group meet the remainingÂ children of the forestÂ and the three-eyed crow.[14]
Â 
Jojen falls into a resigned depression, wanting to go home toÂ Greywater Watch. Meera implies while speaking with Bran that Jojen has had aÂ greendreamÂ of his fate when he goes to Greywater Watch, and that the outcome is not good.[15]
2118	Farwynds Oceanseer	2014-05-11	Jojen will set himself on fire to hatch BR's dragon egg. It is known.
2119	Gertrude	2014-05-11	I haven't read this whole thread meticulously, but I haven't seen any theories that he's referring to dragonfire. That's where my head went. I thought Meera was asking how they will know it's the end, not a specific death for any of them. The end of the crisis in the North should (I hope) involve Dragonfire.
2120	Blazfemur	2014-05-13	I haven't read this whole thread meticulously, but I haven't seen any theories that he's referring to dragonfire. That's where my head went. I thought Meera was asking how they will know it's the end, not a specific death for any of them. The end of the crisis in the North should (I hope) involve Dragonfire.


Â 
the end of the crisis in king's landing i would hope, ends in dragonfire. kings landing gets destroyed, not only by dragonfire, by dragonfire erupting the hidden caches of wildfire. together it all burns, the throne gets destroyed, and there is no throne to inherit. the seven kingdoms, become seven kingdoms once more.
Â 
...my hopes, anyway
2121	eagleheart	2014-06-28	After watching the Season 4 finale, this mystery has been solved.Â 
Â 
Jojen's hand, along with the rest of him, was burned by a Child of the Forest after he was stabbed to prevent him coming back as a Wight. Â When Bran meets the 3 eyed raven, the Raven says that Jojen knew he was going to die.
Â 
Jojen's burning hand was Jojen seeing what was in store for himself - a fiery death - and he decided to take Bran north anyway.
2122	Blazfemur	2014-05-05	Legit, I totally thought this wouldve been her stabbing him, and that wound festering, and him "dying" at that point. I mean, they were next to the river, isn't that the river Elder Brother finds him at? THe same river that flows to Quiet Isle, and he says many other things wash up there (Rhaeger's Rubies, etc).
Â 
I'd likeÂ to think Brienne/Podrick arent too too far from Quiet Isle. Yes there is some things that need to come to pass first but, hell, theyre on their way there.
Â 
Arya tries to stab Hound, Hound laughs and swipes it away. I saw the stab and was like, "Ok, this is the part. This is how that's going to happen."
Â 
....and then D&D are like, "NOPE! Not yet! Fooled ya! Trolololol!"
Â 
It seems as though Hound putting down Syrio, and Syrio's fighting style, kind of alligns itself with Faceless Priest training Arya to forget who she was/everything about her past.
Â 
I'm hoping they're not going to skip Braavos and have the Hound be the sit-in Faceless Kindly Man, but from what I recall, we even see the TItan Of Braavos in one of the preview scenes so Braavos IS coming.
Â 
On a side note, it's appearing that The Gravedigger controversy, much like many other side-stories and hidden easter eggs, may get skipped upon completely.
Â 
I'm not disliking extra scenes with Arya & The Hound, theyre hilarious, and the inclusion of The Red Woman, Lord Beric Dondarrion, and Thoros Of Myr into her prayers was a nice touch made positively. Theyre responsible for The Hound still being alive, through the judgment fight. Also, Melisandre responsible for her losing Gendry iirc.
2123	evita mgfs	2014-05-05	I am going to sing the lyrics from Frozen and "Let it go!"Â  I mean, so much has been changed about to accommodate bringing the page to the stage [television] that what other recourse do we who love the novels have?Â  I do think events may be scrambled, but the character arc will remain in tact.
Â 
As for Arya and the Hound, I love them together on television as much as in the novels.Â  My favorite scene was when they sat side by side, slurping down soup just like a father and son daughter might!
2124	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-05	I was pleasantly surprised that she actually tried to stab him. They were getting a bit too friendly and that scene showed them as the violent, tough-as-nails motherfuckers they both are. I also like that he's still in her prayer. That's true to her characterization on the book as well: even after he saved her, she still held a grudge about Mycah and about him not saving Cat and Robb (as if he could have)
Â 
As for Brienne and Pod, I think an almost-encounter with Arya and Sandor is a must
2125	lostinwesteros	2014-05-05	Oh, shit, lost my post.
Was surprised when I saw the preview for this episode and thought she might have really stabbed him.  I hope, I hope they keep Quiet Isle, but I fear not.  Perhaps they'll let him show up in Bravos, or else go join the Second Sons, after all.  Just love the Arya/Sandor scenes and am already dreading the point where she leaves him, showing no mercy.
2126	DogLover	2014-05-05	I realize the Arya/Hound scenes are a favorite of show viewers, but I can't stand them. One of my issues with the Arya/Hound show!narrative is they almost reversed the characters. First, book!Hound never physically harmed the peasant he stole the cart from to get into the RW. The show portrayed him as a cold-blooded murderer and Arya as some beacon of justice. So, show!Hound is not only a thief, but he's a cold-blooded murderer, as well. Then he's apparently a man with a "code" who doesn't steal, even though the audience already knows he steals. Even though the audience already knows he lost all his gold because he was robbed by the BwB, Arya, who was there when he was robbed, can't figure out why he has no gold, and apparently the Hound forgot, as well. Then in the next scene he's stealing from another villager, AND HARMS HIM: A man who not only offers guest rights, but offers him fair work for fair wages (book!Hound accepts this and never harms anyone). Book!Arya HATES the idea of spending any time in the village. Show!Arya is relieved by the prospect.Â 
Â 
But what Â REALLY sent me over the edge with show!Hound is him slapping Arya. Arya suffers beatings by Yoren and her captors at Harrenhall, but as much as she tries to kill and get under the skin of the Hound, he never hits her. NEVER. Regardless of his emotional state, he never raises a had to her. It pissed me off to no end that show!Hound SLAPPED Arya. So out of character.Â

2127	yushkevitch	2014-05-06	Viewers who haven't read the books were probably thinking the two were forming a buddy relationship. In fact I started to think that a few times (you know, they do alter some things from the seriesÂ  ).
Â 
But as we've all seen countless time in novels, movies, theater, opera, you name it, a duo isn't very interesting if they get along. The tension between the two is what makes their scenes together dramatic and engaging.Â 
Â 
Okay, now that I think about it I don't really have a point .. Oh yes, I do they think they did the stabbing scene as a direct "ha ha, fooled you" to readers. I honestly enjoy it, makes watching so much more interesting when you think Â you know what's happening next and then ... oops.

2128	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-06	No, I wasn't surprised. It would have been pretty stupid if the Hound just 'let' Arya stab him like that. He's not an idiot.

Â 
Â 
No, I was not surprised in the least. It's too early for the Hound to receive his final wound. I think that will happen in episode 8 (coinciding with Gregor getting his mortal wound). Arya will leave for Bravos in ep. 10 (but we will already get to see Bravos because Stannis is going there next week) and the Quiet Isle, if it is included, will most likely be in season 5.Â 
Â 
I also think that Sandor's comments were less about making Arya forget about her past than they were about her unrealistic notions about the workings of the world. He was making clear to her, what Karl was telling Jon at Craster's Keep: you can have the best fighting teacher, the best footwork and nice castle-forged steel, but that won't do diddly squat if your not adapted to the situation at hand (reading: do NOT fight with a LONGsword in CLOSE quarters and do not go against an ARMED and ARMORED kingsguard with NO armor and nothing but a PRACTICE sword).
2130	FC_Lymond	2014-05-06	They didn't resolve the stabbing though.
Â 
Next week the wound might be festering, and the Hound weak from it.Â Â
2131	DrownedSnow	2014-05-06	I liked everything about that scene. I think it really worked. No, I don't know what the show is doing there but my guess is they just want to spend more time in the Arya/Hound dynamic. It's a smart move like keeping Bronn around to work with Jaime.Â
2132	Angmar	2014-05-06	I thought it foreshadowed what will eventually come: the actual wound and the gift of mercy.
Â 
Heck seeing how those two scenes went, I thought it meant Arya herself would kill the Hound in the show...A change I wouldn't like at all.

2134	graaf_x	2014-05-06	Of course the "stab" was there just to tease the viewers. No one will spoil character's death or fatal wound in the promo.
Â 
Anyway, Hound's head scars are getting bigger with each episode, it seems.

The sword never touched the Hound, it never went through his armor. 
For the OP, Brienne and Pod just left Kings Landing, they are a long ways off from the Quiet Isle, if they even get there this season. Arya did very little from the events at the Red Wedding to when she left for Braavos in ASoS, so they need to make up interesting/funny scenes between her and the Hound until the Hound is wounded and she takes off. Arya and the Hound are too popular of characters for them to be in 2-3 episodes all season. So, we get scenes like last night where Arya and the Hound interact  Arya learns some stuff when it comes to sword fighting and everyone gets a good laugh from the Hound reminding Arya how ignorant she really is. It's all a part of her growth as a character until she finally gets to Braavos.
Braavos is mentioned too much and plays too much of a role in Aryas story for her not to go there, why would they bother having Jaqen give her the coin if she was never going?

So true. Book Sandor is sufficiently morally ambiguous, why must they make him worse?

2140	Inv1ctus	2014-05-06	You gotta laugh at Arya/Hound scenes, how he was dismissive of Meryn Trant, ahhaha. The slap was a bit surprising to me, but it was good for Arya's sake, she thinks she's Syrio but she is not. She would only get killed by what she was doing, so it was good that the Hound showed her the reality, this time only with a slap. In a real fight she'd be dead.Â
2141	Tixu Oty	2014-05-06	Arya tries to stab Hound, Hound laughs and swipes it away. I saw the stab and was like, "Ok, this is the part. This is how that's going to happen."

Â 
I like book Hound so much better than show Hound, and that since season 2. I wish show Hound had as much depth but that's alright, he's ok I guess. Also I watch show Hound with book Hound in mind and that helps a little.
I didn't think Arya's stabbing had worked from the preview but I am surprised that she actually tried to stab him, and that she included Beric and Thoros in her prayers. It looks to me as if D&D are already on a shortcut to murderous Arya. I guess this way Dareon will come a little bit less as a surprise and I suppose it makes sense but I'm still a bit shocked and can't wait to see where this goes.
Other than that, for the moment I think there is no reason to believe their story will be greatly altered. I still see Braavos in Arya's future and near death in the Hound's.
A near reunion between Arya/Sansa/Brienne would be awesome and I noted that show Brienne is headed directly to the Wall. Smart girl. Headed due North.
Â 
And as far as trolling goes, am I the only one who thought the show was trolling us about Syrio's death/non-death? I only watched the episode once but at first the Hound almost seem to hint that Syrio couldn't be dead if he was such a good swordsman. Only then comes the lesson about armor and weapons. I thought that piece of conversation was really great. (Btw, I think Syrio's dead, but nice trolling nonetheless).
2142	Gurthnar	2014-05-06	I think the slap served its purpose when the Hound was shown walking away and Arya lying on the ground presumably shocked by everything that happened. I'd like to think it was a little return to reality for her.
2143	dbunting	2014-05-06	The slap was definitely needed. I mean, really, the Hound is out of character for doing that? She just tried to stab him!Yeah, they need to milk these two for as long as they can, very enjoyable, just like Arya and Tywin.
2144	FC_Lymond	2014-05-06	There are so many things for Arya in Braavos.Â  Wish she would get there sooner than later.Â  There's nothing going on in these scenes.
2145	Mad Monkey	2014-05-06	I vaguely remember Sandor hitting Arya with an axe in the book...
2146	Laniki	2014-05-06	I think the slap served its purpose when the Hound was shown walking away and Arya lying on the ground presumably shocked by everything that happened. I'd like to think it was a little return to reality for her.


  Â  After what she did to the guy after the Red Wedding and later was part of at the inn a few episodes earlier, Arya needs a reality check. Â Not every tough guy is going to be as accommodating as Polliver. As far as I'm concerned, Arya became fair game for a smack down when she tried to stab him with the pointy end.Â

Â 
Â 
That was my first thought. The conversation states off with him implying "hey, why would Syrio be dead because Trant is terrible" but then he was like "unarmed and outnumbered? Guess even Trant could kill him then". I think it them just screwing with us. There is no way Syrio won that battle. He either died or was captured. I think they just killed him and Martin didn't show it because he didn't think he needed to. They were killing all of Stark's men.
2148	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-06	There are so many things for Arya in Braavos.Â  Wish she would get there sooner than later.Â  There's nothing going on in these scenes.


There's loads going on in these scenes. It's called characterization. The building up and evolution of the two characters. Arya the character progressed a lot in this episode. We see how her training has progressed and how she has no forgiveness for the Hound or the Brothers without Banners. That's a huge leap forward in terms of the show turning Arya into a remorseless killer.
Â 
I suppose they could have shortened the scenes to a 30 second 80's style training montage. but I don't think it would have had the same impact

2149	coppersam	2014-05-06	I personally loved the scenes between the Hound and Arya in this episode. Â It was a nice reminder for viewers that this is NOT a buddy comedy, and there is no love between these two. Â Arya was/is clearly willing to stick him with the pointy end at the first opportunity she gets, and the Hound is not here as a mentor; he is her captor and is literally knocking her back into reality before she gets herself killed. Â If she dies, he doesnt get paid, and we have already seen her independently attack armed (and armoured) men, so he definitely has an interest in protecting her. Â As to the complaint about him hitting her, I dont see how this is out of character for either book or tv Hound. Â He has regularly shown brutality to other characters (including children), and this is not the first time he has smacked Arya in the dome to "save" her (Red Wedding- with an axe nonetheless- and here to remind her what might happen against a real opponent). Â The chemistry that these two have on screen I think makes it easy to forget that they are not friends, so this scene was great to remind us where they stand. Â A few other thoughts:
The Syrio mention, in my opinion, was not meant to "troll" or lead us to believe that he is still alive. Â Again, it was a reality check for Arya. Â I think it will help add to her motivation that she needs to leave and go to Braavos to be trained. Â It makes it easier for non-book readers to understand why she needs to leave. Â Also, Syrio is dead, people. Â Sad, but true. Â I think to have him come back later as a faceless man or something similar would just piss me off. Â Everyone that is "dead" cannot keep coming back like some crazy affirmation of the Iron Borns' "what is dead may never die" incantation. Â 
I was very impressed to see Maisie Williams "water dancing." Â She is such a talented young actress, and Im sure it takes quite a bit of training to even learn how to gracefully and adeptly handle the sword. Â Im sure her dancing background helped a lot!
Really enjoyed Arya's discussion with the Hound about having to say the names and then still tacking on his own at the end. Â His reaction was great too!

2150	Envie	2014-05-06	No, I wasn't surprised by this scene, even with that trolling teaser they put in last week's preview. Having the scene cut off abruptly when she stabbed needle at his gut was just a hilarious trick and I knew she wasn't going to stab him for real. Sure they've had characters do things in the show that were never in the book but I was almost 100% sure this wouldn't be one of them. Arya and the Hound are too important and too good for the television show's popularity so yes as someone else said, I think they're going to milk it for all they can before they part ways and Arya heads for Braavos.
Â 
As I said in the other thread about this topic - I think the scene was very useful to show Arya getting another harsh "lesson" about fighting. She's not going to be able to 'water dance' her way through her hit list. How does she hope to achieve being a killer if she's so small and has only a small sword that can't pierce armor? She's going to have to learn another way. It's a lead in for her assassination career. She'll remember this. She's very smart and she wants to find ways to use her size and quickness to her advantage. She's obviously rogue material, not warrior. This it to show the audience why she has motivation to learn from the Faceless Men.
2151	Tixu Oty	2014-05-06	I agree with you Coppersam, this scene is definitely meant primarily as a reality-check. It also helps to remind us once again of Braavos. But all that doesn't exclude a side of trolling, which might very well have been unintentional. The effect is that same to me: it was fun. Plus it's nice to remind us of Syrio, who was a very enjoyable character, so this scene is a winner on all counts.
(ps: I agree that Syrio's most certainly dead but the only thing I know for sure, is that I don't know a thing. I keep an open mind about anything, just in case).
Â 
Â 
 The Syrio mention, in my opinion, was not meant to "troll" or lead us to believe that he is still alive. Â Again, it was a reality check for Arya.

Â 
Exactly! It's nice to keep us scratching our heads a little though
2153	Trillian	2014-05-06	I think the slap was "needed" to distance the pair from the other travelling couple, Brienne and Podrick, who are actually becoming friendly. They couldn't show them getting along, otherwise viewers could think they are becoming buddies as well. So yeah, it might be slighly OOC, but I get it, and it fits as a reality check in Arya's personal growth before Braavos.
2154	gotgrrrl	2014-05-06	I think that the Hound's assessment that having armor and a sword is superior and that Syrio must be dead isn't necessarily true and shows that he has certain assumptions about what it means to be a good fighter.Â  The Hound assumes that a big sword and armor will always beat "water dancing" but being smarter and more agile thanÂ  your opponent (playing the mental game) can also be effective.Â  Faceless Men rely on stealth and smarts, which I think is far more dangerous than a large sword as was shown by Jaqen at Harrenhall.Â
2155	Tixu Oty	2014-05-06	You're right, though large swords and armor are not to be underestimated, and I think this reads also as Arya getting tutoring on different kinds of fighting (Syrio/Jaqen/The Hound/the Faceless Men). She's getting a very wide range and a wide view of the world.
2156	Fat Trell	2014-05-06	I think that the Hound's assessment that having armor and a sword is superior and that Syrio must be dead isn't necessarily true and shows that he has certain assumptions about what it means to be a good fighter.Â  The Hound assumes that a big sword and armor will always beat "water dancing" but being smarter and more agile thanÂ  your opponent (playing the mental game) can also be effective.Â  Faceless Men rely on stealth and smarts, which I think is far more dangerous than a large sword as was shown by Jaqen at Harrenhall.Â 


Â 
Being agile doesn't equal being smart. Being an assassin is nothing like being a waterdancer.
Â 
The point of that discussion, to me at least, was that confronting a big man in big armor with a big sword, while you yourself are small, lightly armored, and armed withÂ either have no sword or a small blade; is a losing proposition. Meaning Arya isn't going to be able to kill the people on her list by being a warrior.
2157	jarl the climber	2014-05-06	Â 
But i must admit, the show!hound lines are so great i can put up with the character changes


I agree as well, on the other hand she did include him her hit list and she let him know it, which probably hurt his feelings. Then the next morning she did try to kill him, if she could have she would have, at least for those couple of seconds, and that probably hurt his feelings too.
I guess he lost his temper in the heat of the moment, he did give her the sword back instead of breaking it over his knee, which it looked he thought about for a second or two, so giving it back was an apology of sorts or as close as she will get to one from him.
2158	salmonsnake	2014-05-06	On the other hand he knows she could have killed him when he was sleeping. But I don't think he's too worried about dying.

I highly doubt Arya listing The Hound on her kill list as well as trying to poke him with Needle 'hurt Sandor's feelings' much. He thinks she's an annoying little twat for the most part and a pain in his ass that he's only keeping around because he wants hostage gold for her skinny butt. They do NOT have a very amiable relationship in the books or on the show either one and I was personally glad to see the audience reminded of that when he slapped her hard enough to make her mouth bleed. I love Arya to death, don't get me wrong - she's probably one of my top three favorite stories / characters of all time in the books but she's got a long ways to go in learning her role and this scene played that up perfectly. The Hound is reminding her just how far she's got to go before she ever hopes to kill a man in a fight. It reinforces her need to learn sneakier / assassin ways and gets us excited for her Braavos journey.
2160	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-06	The slap was definitely needed. I mean, really, the Hound is out of character for doing that? She just tried to stab him!
Â 


Â 
Â 
Yes, I agree. It's brutal, but then again, she did just stab him - and that was no play stab, he is on her list - and I think if it was anyone else but Arya Stark that person would be dead shortly after hitting the ground.
Â 
I think one thing about their relationship is: the Hound sees himself when he sees her - seething, cynical and hate-filled. She may be highborn but is no respecter of social rank, and neither is he. One part of this similarity is that when Arya judges him, she judges him the way he'd judge himself. Would he forgive someone like himself for Mycah? Deep down, no.
Â 
I think this is why the Hound feels some unspoken obligation to keep her around, and even teach her a bit of the real-world. If it was for truly mercenary reasons (like the way Bronn is), he'd have bound her up and delivered her to some Freys for a quick reward.
2161	The Lizard King	2014-05-06	I think that the way it will work out in the show is that Sandor gets mortally wounded at the Bloody Gate while trying to ransom Arya to Lysa (who may or may not have gone through the Moon Door yet), perhaps by Ser Donnel Waynwood, who was introduced this past episode.
Â 
http://gameofthrones...Donnel_Waynwood
2162	The Reader Lisa	2014-05-06	Unpleasantly surprised by his backhanding her. Didn't like the scene, didn't like the episode, don't know what they're
doing or where they are going.....and neither do they, I think. Yes, the Hound hit her with an axe; yes, he was rough
and brutally honest with her during their wanderings. But I can't believe anyone can really believe he hung on to her
just for gold. He served at court as Joffrey's swornshield even before he was made a Kingsguard and he has to know how crazy Lysa Arryn is. She talks in the book about how Joffrey used to tease and torment Sweet Robin and
the Hound had to have been in the big middle of that. She's more likely to have him thrown out the Moon Door as
reward.him for returning Arya. In the book, after the Red Wedding it is clear from his behavior(not eating, chopping
tons of firework and then not lighting a fire, bitter, unhappy looks in her direction) that he thinks seriously about just
abandoning her. He tells her she's not worth squat to him now. But, as I have always taken it, some tiny shred of decency prevents him from acting on this evil impulse. True, as a caretaker,Â  he sucks a big one. But he feeds her
(he splits the hare he caught in half even though he's what?.....three times her size) and takes the job building the
palisade to provide shelter and money for them both. And she's his link with Sansa. And I agree with the person
who said they've reversed the Hound's and Arya's roles. Instead of trailing along traumatized in his wake, Little
Miss Perky seems to be calling the shots. And as much as I love Rory, he was way too Scottish in that scene. It was
like there was no one directing it, just a camera rolling. The whole episode was like that, flat, awkward and aimless.
Â
2163	MoA«t	2014-05-06	They didn't resolve the stabbing though.
Â 
Next week the wound might be festering, and the Hound weak from it.Â Â 

Â 





There are so many things for Arya in Braavos.Â  Wish she would get there sooner than later.Â  There's nothing going on in these scenes.


First you saw something that didn't happen, then you say there's nothing happening in these scenes.....
Â 
Arya has much more to do now with Sandor than run off for Braavos where we rarely saw her in the books. There's only 3 Arya chapters in AFFC, and only 2 in ADWD.Â 
Â 
They need to keep her and the Hound together for as long as poss.
2164	Karmarni	2014-05-06	^Agree, it was poorly filmed. Wasn't it Michele MacLaren who said before that she didn't get the Hound? Funny since she's touted as the 'action' director. Yes, it seems they are using Sandor to prop up Arya. He did seem fine staying in the village with her until they kicked him out.
There were calls of whitewashing the Hound in Season 2. And he was chivalric to Sansa.  And then we get an even more angry, gruff, harsh Hound with Arya. He baited her about Mycah when he cried on the book, he was going to kill the pig farmer on the show, when he didn't for the reader. He hits the man who takes him in and steals from him, he smacks Arya just like Meryn did Sansa right in the scene where they were talking about Meryn.  
I'm not sure I understand the change. Did they think he wasn't dangerous enough before? They made the choices they did to him with Sansa. They gave Littlefinger his story, the changed GRRM's script with the song and used the 'you won't hurt me' line from the deleted scene with them and therefore cut it from the aired episode.
2165	Le Cygne	2014-05-06	Yeah, book Hound was very different, I think they are sacrificing his character development for hers. He's propping her up. He never would have hit her, they could have had him just shove her. He's teaching her lessons at the expense of his own story.He was driving himself nuts about that time about standing by while they hit Sansa, the whole time he was with Arya. He really couldn't have done more than he did, which was give her advice, try to head Joffrey off from doing it, and help her afterwards, but that he blamed himself is pretty revealing. He said, "No one would hurt you again."So add that to all that he tried to do, and "Enough" and "Fuck the king" and then later, bringing it up repeatedly to Arya. After the Beric fight, "I watched them beat your sister bloody, too" - that's him saying he failed her. And then he tells Arya, "I never beat your sister." And then finally (rule of three), he says, "I stood there in my white cloak and let them beat her" while sobbing.Hitting Arya with an axe was to save her life, she was running headfirst into a massacre, and he risked his life to save her (which he did for Sansa, too, earlier, walking into a 30-to-1 mob to do so). And that was the second time he saved Arya in that chapter, earlier he saved her when she was cornered. He wasn't just in it for the money, that was Sansa's sister.When she was about to hit him with a rock, she said he took it from her like a baby and gave her another chance. After a while of this, she came to realize he wasn't going to hurt her. When she hit him below the belt by saying he lost his belly for fighting, that was the maddest he ever got, and all he did was toss her the food he caught and cooked for her.She stayed with him even though she kept saying he didn't care if she ran off or not. When they were about to go into the inn, she thought to herself, here's my chance, I can leave. And she thinks we shouldn't go in here. But what does she do? She follows him into danger. And then she still doesn't leave, she defends him, he would have died if she hadn't.And then after he passes out, she doesn't leave then, either, she finishes caring for his wounds. And she takes him off her list, and asks why she did that, and thinks she barely knew Mycah. But she's come to know the Hound, is the subtext. And she thinks, I could just leave, "I wouldn't have to kill him."And all through this she starts calling him Sandor. And then she can't bring herself to kill him. And her parting shot is, you should have saved my life better, you should have saved my mother. That's like saying you should have been a superhero. So yeah, she wasn't fond of him, but there was something going on there.She was conflicted when she left him.

Did the Hound need to backhand her to make his point? No. Did I care that he did? Not really.

But book Arya was smart enough to know that already.And if show Arya killed the Hound, what next? He's taking her to her aunt, and she's safe with him, without him, she'd last like a day on the road, if that. So they went there with the ooc stuff for nothing.

Exactly, she gives him a sense of purpose, hes spent all of his adult life serving people like Arya, and like you have pointed out he is serving her by trying to deliver her to a relative at least instead of an enemy.Â
2170	Tixu Oty	2014-05-07	Thanks for the great recap Le Cygne. Yes it does seem like Arya's time with the Hound is making up with the character building that we didn't get in Harrenhal. I didn't have a problem with the scenes as I was watching them, but you guys are expressing exactly why I like the books so much better.Â  Also, I remember that when I was reading the book, for me Arya's adventures with the Hound were about Arya realizing he wasn't a bad guy after all, about the Hound proving this to us, and about his love for Sansa, which was really downplayed in the show. That's what I was mostly eager to read about in those chapters. Sooo it makes me wonder if the show's take on the Hound means there's not so much going on between him and Sansa.
2171	Sirar Salih	2014-05-07	Here is what I think is going to happen:
Â 
Brienne/Pod will cross roads with Hound/Arya. Brienne is looking for the Stark girls, so she demands that the Hound hand over Arya, the Hound refuses and an epic duel takes place between Brienne and the Hound. Brienne wins the duel and gravely wounds the Hound, Brienne then takes Arya with her and they leave the Hound to his death. Arya later escapes to Braavos where she becomes a faceless assassin.
Â 
This scenario makes Brienne a valuable witness against fArya later on.

2173	Onion Seaworth	2014-05-07	I realize the Arya/Hound scenes are a favorite of show viewers, but I can't stand them. One of my issues with the Arya/Hound show!narrative is they almost reversed the characters. First, book!Hound never physically harmed the peasant he stole the cart from to get into the RW. The show portrayed him as a cold-blooded murderer and Arya as some beacon of justice. So, show!Hound is not only a thief, but he's a cold-blooded murderer, as well. Then he's apparently a man with a "code" who doesn't steal, even though the audience already knows he steals. Even though the audience already knows he lost all his gold because he was robbed by the BwB, Arya, who was there when he was robbed, can't figure out why he has no gold, and apparently the Hound forgot, as well. Then in the next scene he's stealing from another villager, AND HARMS HIM: A man who not only offers guest rights, but offers him fair work for fair wages (book!Hound accepts this and never harms anyone). Book!Arya HATES the idea of spending any time in the village. Show!Arya is relieved by the prospect.Â 
Â 
But what Â REALLY sent me over the edge with show!Hound is him slapping Arya. Arya suffers beatings by Yoren and her captors at Harrenhall, but as much as she tries to kill and get under the skin of the Hound, he never hits her. NEVER. Regardless of his emotional state, he never raises a had to her. It pissed me off to no end that show!Hound SLAPPED Arya. So out of character.Â 


So you don't like dark fantasy at all?
If you say you do then you are bullshitting... Dark story and Dark fantasy is filled with racism, blood, gritty and horrifying with all hope for the ''good guys'' is extinguished whilst the bad guys live and the moral grey people like the hound is the people who live in dark fantasy. look at the witcher, and at Game of thrones/Asioaf... It's like it is for a reason.
2174	Le Cygne	2014-05-07	How is it that saying they reversed the characterization for the Hound and Arya on the show is not liking dark fantasy. It was actually more interesting with the woman being the darker character.Arya and the Hound were heading in opposite directions in the books, Arya was heading where the Hound had been emotionally, and the Hound was heading away from that darker place. There was actually character development and a story taking place for Sandor (Arya even started calling him Sandor, imagine that, he has a name).He had gone from hate driving him to love driving him, and that love was for someone Arya once loved, too. But she hasn't come up yet for some reason (even though he brought her up a dozen times in the books). Arya had lost those she loved and felt more and more like no one, hate was driving her now.There was a last glimmer of who she once was with the Hound, maybe hating wasn't the way, maybe when you get to know someone, things don't look so black and white anymore. On to the House of Black and White.

Â 
Not really. Bad dark fantasy usually fits your description. Formulaic and vulgarly simplistic morality tales are just bad, even when the morality is turned upside down and "good guys" replace "bad guys" in the role of traditional losers. Thankfully, ASOIAF books are pretty far from that territory.
2176	Angmar	2014-05-07	Maybe they cut all of the Sansa-Sandor references in the show because it's obvious the show prefers dwelling with the Sansa-Tyrion scenario. Sansa already has left the capital and in most of her scenes from there she spoke nicely of Tyrion.

2177	Le Cygne	2014-05-07	I seriously doubt it. Sophie said in a recent interview, Sansa doesn't love Tyrion, and on the recap said marrying him was the worst day in Sansa's life. If that were the case, Pod would end up with Tyrion. Shae would end up with Tyrion. Bronn would end up with Tyrion. Even Cersei would end up with Tyrion before this season. They've painted scenes of each of these characters with him FAR nicer than in the books, and them far nicer to him in return. The whole show is a love story between Tyrion/Westeros. When he goes to Essos, it will be Tyrion/Essos. Watch out, Jorah, you are about to lose your story, too.

You can tell between good dark and bad dark ofcourse but more or less it's the way it is.
The witcher fills my quota and that is the only time i have felt the atmosphere triumphed over ASIOAF world.
Â 
MY personal favorites are reedeming characters, falling characters and total psychos.
Dark is never about morality it's about realism to show that this is more or less the way the world is the world is not filled with knights in shining armor the world is filled with cutthroats and rapers.
thing is a fantasy story have knights but Dark fantasy has knights who are not honorable nor filled with bravery. No dark fantasy can make a knight into a rapist and a thief since that is basically what a knight does during a war.
Â 
and by god... I love it.
Â 
Favorite comic books I have are dark comics meaning new 52 DC universe batman and suicide squad, Fables and The walking dead.
I love dark fantasy and storytelling and as you said sometimes it's not that good but from time to time there comes something that does it right.
and that is why I am against most of the theories in asioaf. *(meaning R+L AAR PTWP)*
Cause to me Dark fantasy should not have hidden romance and love, or a person who is some kind of superman being able to survive in situations most would not.
Â 
but I digress let's talk about the topic at hand.
I liked this scene very very much
2179	coppersam	2014-05-07	Arya appears in AFFC Samwell III so that's 4 in Crows.(That one is short, I know.)
For me those 6 chapters were very rich in material, strange happenings, over all hooked me in.
As I remember those are long chapters (well George does that!) full of so many exotic things , I can see , if elaborated well finding plenty of material in Braavos.
Braavos itself is , for me, so far the most interesting setting in the books.


Â 
I agree. Â I can't wait for Arya to get to Braavos because I think it will be so interesting. Â I definitely think there is enough good material there to keep viewers interested throughout season 5 (which is when I predict she will arrive and go through her training). Â My only concern is that they keep cutting things due to budget, and I wonder how much they have set aside for the House of Black and White and Braavos. Â In my mind, it was all very exotic and detailed, so I am concerned that CGI would be required for the settings and eat into their budget, maybe causing a lot of the scale of the scenes to be cut back. Â 
Â 


Here is what I think is going to happen:
Â 
Brienne/Pod will cross roads with Hound/Arya. Brienne is looking for the Stark girls, so she demands that the Hound hand over Arya, the Hound refuses and an epic duel takes place between Brienne and the Hound. Brienne wins the duel and gravely wounds the Hound, Brienne then takes Arya with her and they leave the Hound to his death. Arya later escapes to Braavos where she becomes a faceless assassin.
Â 
This scenario makes Brienne a valuable witness against fArya later on.


Â 
I really like this idea. Â I think the quiet isle is going to get cut, so this could make sense. Â It would change Brienne's story drastically though, I would imagine. Â She has to have something to do for the remainder of this season and next, so I think she still needs to go to Maidenpool (and this is great to give more background on her with Ser Hyle Hunt). Â Cool idea, but I would be surprised if it happens. Â

Sadly, I think it's going to happen... After she refused to leave with Sandor, she never gave him a second thought. After all they didn't even talkÂ to each other as they did in the books. They never established a real connection, and now they won't meet again for another... maybe two, three seasons (because he'll be "dead")? Why should he suddenly pop up in her mind now? Â
2182	Gabriel Belmont the Dragon	2014-05-07	I liked the scene sandor teaching arya some real world hardship.
2183	Shebara	2014-05-07	I was pleasantly surprised that she actually tried to stab him. They were getting a bit too friendly and that scene showed them as the violent, tough-as-nails motherfuckers they both are. I also like that he's still in her prayer. That's true to her characterization on the book as well: even after he saved her, she still held a grudge about Mycah and about him not saving Cat and Robb (as if he could have)
Â 
As for Brienne and Pod, I think an almost-encounter with Arya and Sandor is a must


Â 
In the books as far as I remember Brienne is finally reaching the coast on her journey and sees Aryas ship (not knowing that Arya is on it) disappearing for Braavos. That is the close to meeting point in the books.
2184	The_Lone_Direwolf	2014-05-07	I think that the Hound's assessment that having armor and a sword is superior and that Syrio must be dead isn't necessarily true and shows that he has certain assumptions about what it means to be a good fighter.Â  The Hound assumes that a big sword and armor will always beat "water dancing" but being smarter and more agile thanÂ  your opponent (playing the mental game) can also be effective.Â  Faceless Men rely on stealth and smarts, which I think is far more dangerous than a large sword as was shown by Jaqen at Harrenhall.Â 


Â 
Â 
Good call and this could also be the show's way of subtly leading us up to the prize fight of the season, the Mountain vs the Red Viper...
Gregor is the living embodiment of the Hound's assumptions (which can't be a coincidence he was mentioned in their scene before this one and of course is his brother) and as seen in the season previews we are going to get to see Oberyn's version of 'water dancing' with his spear work.
Oberyn in the books wears a light scaled armor I think but I bet in the show he will barely wear any.

2185	Le Cygne	2014-05-07	Why should he suddenly pop up in her mind now? Â  Apart from the book story, which is quite detailed and ongoing, when we last checked in with her, she was pretending they kissed/placing him in the marriage bed, and that the author said there's something there, books and show... They spent time on a bunch of scenes with interactions between them that served no purpose in telling the larger story.She is told his story and cheers for him when he is the hero at her father's tourney... putting his hand on her shoulder and staring down Ilyn Payne when she was afraid... a sexy scene in the hallway the author wrote and said was "beautiful"... a scene framing the two where the showrunners comment, "the developing relationship between these two... much more to come"... dabbing her lip after she is beaten, to Joffrey's dismay... lying for her to Joffrey to protect her... giving her his cloak after being visibly upset to see her beaten... another sexy scene in the hallway (he's holding her hand when Tyrion scene bombs to set up the Shae as Sansa's maid scheme, but she looks after Sandor as he goes)... standing by her in the flowering scene when she's crying and he is visibly upset (check out a hi res screencap, he looks like he wants to cry, too)... the rescue scene filmed romantically and he calls her little bird twice... another hallway scene where there's again a hint of sexuality picking up on the last hallway scene, and he looks after her (that's quite the look he gives her)... a goodbye scene written by the author and staged like the goodbye scene in his favorite version of Beauty and the Beast (and yeah, he has a theater named after him, Jean Cocteau) where their costars comment "he loves you" and start singing Beauty and the Beast... a scene last season where he says to her sister ask her if you ever see her again who was there for her...That's a lot of detail on the show, too, and we know they cut a lot of things. But not that.(Added another scene...)

2186	Newstar	2014-05-07	I wouldn't worry until and unless Sandor is unambiguously killed off in the show, and if he survives the season, it's a pretty safe bet he's being kept alive for something.
I think the writers were trying to do something with SanSan, even if they made a botch of it: the riot scene and the deleted scene that should have gone into 2x03 suggested as much. I think it's more a matter of good intentions with a sloppy execution rather than a deliberate attempt to eliminate any hint of SanSan. Again, with the 2x03 scene with SanSan, they went so far as to shoot it and include it as a deleted scene on the DVD. If they were deliberately trying to downplay it, they wouldn't have done that.
...although Tyrion also wound up in that 2x03 scene though he wasn't in the equivalent scene in the books, playing the benevolent intervener to Sandor's antagonist, so I dunno.
With TV Sandor, I do feel like the writers didn't really feel comfortable writing for him until Season 3. When they found their sea legs and had settled on the characterization that they wanted, then the Hound's storyline took off. I think SanSan suffered as a result, but I don't think that was the intent.
Also, and I know mileage varies on this, in my opinion McCann's acting did him NO favours. He's improved in Season 4, but it's too little, too late where SanSan interactions are concerned, since for the published book material that window closed in Season 2.
I do think the TV version of the Sansa/Tyrion relationship was probably more palatable to the TV writers, since it was easier to play it off as something purely platonic or even pseudo-parental. Can't really do that with Sandor. 
Long story short, TV SanSan was a bit of a shitshow in Season 2, I agree, but I think that the writers did try and that it just didn't work for a number of reasons. I don't think that failure necessarily means anything significant for future events in the books, though.

2187	Zorn Gottes	2014-05-07	Apart from the book story, which is quite detailed and ongoing, when we last checked in with her, she was pretending they kissed/placing him in the marriage bed, and that the author said there's something there, books and show... They spent time on a bunch of scenes with interactions between them that served no purpose in telling the larger story.
She is told his story and cheers for him when he is the hero at her father's tourney... a sexy scene in the hallway the author wrote and said was beautiful... a scene framing the two where the showrunners comment, "the developing relationship between these two... much more to come"... dabbing her lip after she is beaten, to Joffrey's dismay... lying for her to Joffrey to protect her... giving her his cloak after being visibly upset to see her beaten... another sexy scene in the hallway... standing by her in the flowering scene when she's crying and he is visibly upset (check out a hi res screencap, he looks like he wants to cry, too)... the rescue scene filmed romantically and he calls her little bird twice... another hallway scene where there's again a hint of sexuality picking up on the last hallway scene, and he looks after her (that's quite the look he gives her)... a goodbye scene written by the author and staged like the goodbye scene in his favorite version of Beauty and the Beast (and yeah, he has a theater named after him, Jean Cocteau) where their costars comment "he loves you" and start singing Beauty and the Beast... a scene last season where he says to her sister ask her if you ever see her again who was there for her...
That's a lot of detail on the show, too, and we know they cut a lot of things. But not that.


I hope you are right, but my impression, from the scenes you listed, is that in the show only his feelings were well established, and since when they departed from each other, she doesn't even seem to remember he ever existed... In addition, all she talks about now isÂ how a good person is TyrionÂ (I'm still feebly hoping it will not turn intoÂ oh how I miss Tyrion)Â
2188	Karmarni	2014-05-07	It seems that the Sandor/Arya scenes on this episode set up a few things to come. Gregor and Sandor and Sandor's thoughts on him; the Hound being the last name and that she then went to stab him suggest that she will remove him from the list and not kill him; the reference to Meryn and the slap will call back Sansa's slap by Meryn - with Arya saying Sandor shouldn't have hit her; the armor and a big sword - McCann says he's in a shirt in a Rolling Stone interview so this may be how he goes down. All setting up the 'you shouldn't have hit me' and his remorse for Sansa.
2189	Newstar	2014-05-07	I hope you are right, but my impression, from the scenes you listed, is that in the show only his feelings were well established, and since when they departed from each other, she doesn't even seem to remember he ever existed...

That could just be simple Tyrion whitewashing.
I will say, though, that if I was one of the TV writers and I was trying to lay the groundwork for a future relationship between a (currently) 14-year-old female character and a male character almost three times as old as she is, the way the show has written the TV version of the Sansa/Tyrion relationship to date would be exactly how I would play it.

2190	Envie	2014-05-07	I was disappointed with how GRRM left the Hound's strory in ADWD. I know it left it wide open for a whole lot of theories and speculation but sadly my spidey senses are telling me this is just another one of those he's killed off after getting our hopes up for another 'redemption' character. The Hound has always been one we wanted to be redeemed so badly - because of his face / brother - there's so much we can sympathize with. They've also done such a fantastic job portraying him in the show - and the actor is perfect for the role.Â
2191	Le Cygne	2014-05-07	Also don't think the ages are an issue...  Sansa is close enough to 16 (was 15 at the end of last season, and some time has passed), Sandor is playing 30's.
Here's the link setting her at 15-16:http://gameofthrones...iki/Sansa_Stark

2192	The Prophet of Patch	2014-05-07	Not sure if anyone else mentioned this (I skimmed), but the first of the two Arya/Hound scenes seemed like pretty strong foreshadowing of the Hound taking his wound from the Mountain. I think it would work really well for the format, since it would introduce new-Gregor, remind show-watchers that he's Sandor's brother, and give us a little Mountain fighting before episode 8.
2193	Le Cygne	2014-05-07	I hope you are right, but my impression, from the scenes you listed, is that in the show only his feelings were well established, and since when they departed from each other, she doesn't even seem to remember he ever existed... In addition, all she talks about now isÂ how a good person is TyrionÂ (I'm still feebly hoping it will not turn intoÂ oh how I miss Tyrion)Â  

Just seeing this, I am not at all saying it's good, just seeing what I think they may be up to. The author is telling a really detailed, layered story for them in the books.  Look at it this way, even if the show scenes were all about Sandor, that wouldn't make sense to include all of that detail (look again at what I listed, that's all stuff that would be cut if it didn't matter) just for him, they care even less about him than her.
Don't see the Tyrion thing at all, books or show, so can't speak to that. I could list a bunch of examples showing why that's out (and never was in), but to take yours, everyone is talking about how good Tyrion is. Look at Bronn's scene with Jaime, chiding Jaime for not getting on board the whitewashing express, with the tender story of his devotion, and the scene with Pod, presenting the whitewashing gift with another tender story reference.

2194	Annara Snow	2014-05-07	Â 
I highly doubt Arya listing The Hound on her kill list as well as trying to poke him with Needle 'hurt Sandor's feelings' much. He thinks she's an annoying little twat for the most part and a pain in his ass that he's only keeping around because he wants hostage gold for her skinny butt. They do NOT have a very amiable relationship in the books or on the show either one and I was personally glad to see the audience reminded of that when he slapped her hard enough to make her mouth bleed. I love Arya to death, don't get me wrong - she's probably one of my top three favorite stories / characters of all time in the books but she's got a long ways to go in learning her role and this scene played that up perfectly. The Hound is reminding her just how far she's got to go before she ever hopes to kill a man in a fight. It reinforces her need to learn sneakier / assassin ways and gets us excited for her Braavos journey.


Â 
Then why does he tell her about saving Sansa and go on about how he's not such a bad guy (in both book and show)? Why is he trying to make her like him?
Â 


Â 
Â 
Yes, I agree. It's brutal, but then again, she did just stab him - and that was no play stab, he is on her list - and I think if it was anyone else but Arya Stark that person would be dead shortly after hitting the ground.
Â 
I think one thing about their relationship is: the Hound sees himself when he sees her - seething, cynical and hate-filled. She may be highborn but is no respecter of social rank, and neither is he. One part of this similarity is that when Arya judges him, she judges him the way he'd judge himself. Would he forgive someone like himself for Mycah? Deep down, no.
Â 
I think this is why the Hound feels some unspoken obligation to keep her around, and even teach her a bit of the real-world. If it was for truly mercenary reasons (like the way Bronn is), he'd have bound her up and delivered her to some Freys for a quick reward.


Â 
Now that's much truer, IMO, to how Sandor really feels about Arya.
Â 
The show is getting it wrong by making it seem like Sandor has to tell Arya that the world is awful and you get nowhere by being honorable etc. Arya, at least book!Arya, doesn't need to be told any of that, she's already dark and nihilistic, at an even younger age. Sansa is the one Sandor sees as an innocent idealist, as his former innocent childÂ  self, who needs to be taught that the world is awful, Arya is the angry, traumatized child that he became because of Gregor and the way others let Gregor get away with everything and made him a knight. (Oddly enough, Maisie talked in interviews about Arya being empty and dark this season.)
Â 


^Agree, it was poorly filmed. Wasn't it Michele MacLaren who said before that she didn't get the Hound? Funny since she's touted as the 'action' director. Yes, it seems they are using Sandor to prop up Arya. He did seem fine staying in the village with her until they kicked him out.
There were calls of whitewashing the Hound in Season 2. And he was chivalric to Sansa. And then we get an even more angry, gruff, harsh Hound with Arya. He baited her about Mycah when he cried on the book, he was going to kill the pig farmer on the show, when he didn't for the reader. He hits the man who takes him in and steals from him, he smacks Arya just like Meryn did Sansa right in the scene where they were talking about Meryn.
I'm not sure I understand the change. Did they think he wasn't dangerous enough before? They made the choices they did to him with Sansa. They gave Littlefinger his story, the changed GRRM's script with the song and used the 'you won't hurt me' line from the deleted scene with them and therefore cut it from the aired episode.


Â 
About not crying... It's symptomatic of the way that the show turns characters into the stereotypes they are subverting in the books, and especially the way they treat gender. On the show, little girls cry a lot (especially if they're Sansa, but Myrcella cries too, and I think even Arya cried), in the scenes where they don't actually cry in the books, but grown men never cry, especially if they're big and strong warriors, even though Sandor crying during his emotional meltdowns was so memorable and an integral part of his strongest scenes. But the show would rather have typical 'badass' anti-hero characters spouting comic one-liners (that's also why they like Bronn so much), which apparently gets a great response, than having to deal with such confusing things as 2 m tall huge scary warrior dudes being vulnerable and crying "like a baby" (quote: Arya Stark in the book) because of the childhood trauma that's defined their entire life and personality, and ladylike and apparently meek little girls who offer comfort to the huge scary warrior dude who's having an emotional meltdown and turning into a 6-yer old boy abused by his big brother.
Â 


Maybe they cut all of the Sansa-Sandor references in the show because it's obvious the show prefers dwelling with the Sansa-Tyrion scenario. Sansa already has left the capital and in most of her scenes from there she spoke nicely of Tyrion.
Â 
I hope the show doesn't go this extreme and instead of having Sansa thinking about Sandor in the Vale she starts fantasizing about Tyrion.Â  




I hope you are right, but my impression, from the scenes you listed, is that in the show only his feelings were well established, and since when they departed from each other, she doesn't even seem to remember he ever existed... In addition, all she talks about now isÂ how a good person is TyrionÂ (I'm still feebly hoping it will not turn intoÂ oh how I miss Tyrion)Â  


Â 
Thing is, she only talked about Tyrion in the scenes where she also talked about Tyrion in the book, because he came up in conversation for logical reasons - with LF when they talk about Joffrey's murder, and with Lysa when they talk about Sansa's marriage. She has a more positive opinion of him in the show, yes - they changed her mildly positive statements/mild defenses of Tyrion from the book into stronger positive statements and stronger defenses of Tyrion. Which is consistent with how Tyrion has been portrayed in the show, and how their relationship was portrayed in season 3 - and which is also emblematic of the show's general attempts to portray Tyrion as a total nice guy, and to minimize conflicts between the "good guy" characters (they want to make sure that everyone likes Tyrion despite him having married a 14-year old captive of his family against her will, because they think the show needs an unambiguously likable protagonist, and they also want people to like Sansa now, instead of bitching that she's "not nice" to their favorite character... as so many do in the book fandom).
Â 
However, while there's a big difference in the degree of positivity, the fact remains that book!Sansa, at this point, also talked about Tyrion to LF and Lysa, just as much as show!Sansa did, and also talked positively about him - she tells Lysa that Tyrion didn't consummate the marriage because he was "kind" (and that's book!Tyrion, who made her get naked, groped her breast and made her see him naked and erect, which she was quite traumatized by) and only checks herself when she realizes that she can't say something like that to Lysa because Lysa hates Tyrion so much, so she quickly changes it to "He had whores, he told me" (which he did, in the book, unlike the show)...
Â 
... and the fact remains also that book!Sansa also never talks about Sandor, to anyone. The difference is that we know Sansa's internal thoughts in the books. The show sucks at conveying people's internal thoughts or subtext. I've resigned myself to the fact that GoT is not Six Feet Under or The Sopranos and there will be no dream scenes or fantasy scenes showing what the characters are feeling. That's why it also seems like the Stark kids almostÂ  never think about each other. That's why there's barely any foreshadowing of R+L=J, or... well anything, really. They just have a "previously on" and drop a plot twist. That's why Jon is like - oh, Ghost, I missed you! - well, you wouldn't have known that he missed Ghost before this episode, would you. If the alternative is to have Sansa talk about Sandor all the time like they made Sam talk about Gilly after they left the Craster's the first time (because the subtext has to be either spelled out or ignored), I'd much rather not have her mention him, especially since it makes no sense in her case. Who would she talk about him to? It's not like Lysa or LF or Margaery were going to ask her about him. Nobody knows about their connection, it's one of the few secrets Sansa has even from Littlefinger, and Sandor is completely under the radar of Littlefinger. If Sansa were careless and stupid enough to start talking about him, now that would change the storyline considerably, if Sandor is to play a role in Sansa's story in the future. The show may have unintentionally made LF stupider than he is in the books, but even show!LF would not be that stupid not to catch onto something like that if Sansa was open about it. He's trying to isolate her and convince her that everyone else is untrustworthy, in the book he made sure to let her know (through Dontos) that the Tyrells don't care about her, then he kills Dontos and tells her that Dontos was never her friend and was in it just for the money, then he tells her Tyrion is a monster who gave his first wife to his guards to rape when he got bored of her... (although it's never clear if Sansa actually believed the latter)Â  because LF wants her to think he is her only friend. If Sandor is to play some role in Sansa's story before LF loses her grip on her, it's probably important that LF does not have him on his radar.
Â 


I seriously doubt it. Sophie said in a recent interview, Sansa doesn't love Tyrion, and on the recap said marrying him was the worst day in Sansa's life.


Â 
There was also a video interview (one of the interviews she was giving before season 4 premiered) where she made a very strong "UGH" expression/body language when asked about Sansa being married to Tyrion. (I can't find that video now, I've seen lots of cast interviews at the time of the easom 4 premiere.) She may have been cagey about Sansa's storyline in some aspects (like smiling and saying she can't say anything about whether Sansa will be seen at a location other than KL) but she never went so far to actually lie and feign Sansa/herself having a completely different feeling about something than it really is.

Â 
If that were the case, Pod would end up with Tyrion. Shae would end up with Tyrion. Bronn would end up with Tyrion. Even Cersei would end up with Tyrion before this season. They've painted scenes of each of these characters with him FAR nicer than in the books, and them far nicer to him in return. The whole show is a love story between Tyrion/Westeros. When he goes to Essos, it will be Tyrion/Essos. Watch out, Jorah, you are about to lose your story, too.

Â 
Don't forget Margaery! Margaery will end up with Tyrion more than anyone else, remember how she talked about Tyrion's good looks and his skills in bed (how would she even know that?)! Even Robb may have ended up with TyrionÂ  - they didn't have Robb and Cat learn about Sansa's marriage on the show and express anger and disgust because they assumed Tyrion was raping her and trying to get her pregnant to strengthen the Lannister claim to Winterfell, and they didn't have Robb say that Sansa will be murdered by the Lannisters as soon as she gives them an heir, or that he will make Sansa a widow by cutting Tyrion's head. File that under the same "minimize conflicts and bad thoughts between protagonists" category as show!Dany never saying anything negative about Ned Stark and never using the term "Usurper's dogs" - apparently, the audience can't deal with the concept of sympathetic characters being in conflict with each other due to circumstances or because they don't know the whole story. (Well, they're quite right in that regard: I've seen so much bitching about Dany for that reason among book fans, because apparently she's a horrible person for having a bad opinion about a man she's never met and that she's only ever known about as one of the men who waged war against her family and were responsible for their demise, in Viserys' heavily biased and whitewashed version of RR, which nobody else she knows has cared to seriously challenge.)
Â 
I think it's really Tyrion who's lost his story, more than anyone. Book!Tyrion is widely unpopular, almost nobody likes him, he has a horrible reputation, the highborn find the idea of marrying their daughters to the Imp an insult, he's been dealing with that all his life, and even when people don't hate him, he thinks they do because he's used to thinking that everyone does (as when he thinks that Sansa hates him or that she would rather marry Lancel). He's very insecure, needy and proud and has a bunch of issues. Show!Tyrion is just this good, funny and cool guy who happens to be a dwarf, but is genuinely liked or loved by lots of people, highborn girls like Margaery apparently think he's good marriage material, he has a lover who really loves him as opposed to pretending to because she's paid for it - why would he have issues? I'm really curious how the upcoming trial and Tyrion's dark turn is dealt with and what response it gets from the audience.
2195	Envie	2014-05-07	Â 
Then why does he tell her about saving Sansa and go on about how he's not such a bad guy (in both book and show)? Why is he trying to make her like him?


Â 
I don't know - because that's how the show writers and many readers interpreted it? There's certainly a lot you could potentially read into George's writing as he's often very subtle. Unlike the show, he doesn't feel the need to bash people over the head with clues (or pop them in the mouth) but then again, what he does give is pretty clear once you've read it a couple of times. It took me a re-read to really 'get' a lot of what I've read and am now interpreting over to the television version.Â 
Â 
While I do not think Sandor is as 'evil' as some watching the show may see him (he's definitely one of the better 'gray' characters of the book) I also do not see him as someone with deep feelings for Sansa or Arya either one. The SanSan theorists would disagree passionately, I'm sure. A lot of those 'hints' (little bird singing etc) were never expanded on and the last we saw of Sandor he was laying under a tree dying. There's just not a lot you can do with that now, in watching the show. Y'know?
Â 
I don't take anything I see in the show as a heavy hint anymore. D&D are making stuff up as they go along for quite a bit of the show (the Craster's Keep arc is a good example) and so I'm not going to speculate on Sandor's 'feelings' based on him slapping Arya on the show. It just didn't happen and who knows what D&D think his character should be or thinks - they are, like us, interpreting the books in their own way.
2196	Tixu Oty	2014-05-07	... and the fact remains also that book!Sansa also never talks about Sandor, to anyone. The difference is that we know Sansa's internal thoughts in the books.

Â 
[snip]
Â 
Nobody knows about their connection


Â 
Hmm it's true that the show. doesn't do subtext and is pretty straightforward which does eliminate a lot of possibilities. But if Sandor is relevant in Sansa's future storyline, there could still be somewhat subtle ways to let us know he's on her mind. They could have her drop a sneaky comment about true knights or judging books by their cover or I don't know what else, to a random non dangerous confidant such as Robin. You know, in the same way that Arya made that comment in season 3 about knowing a man who could kill the Hound with his little finger...
Â 
And it's one of the things I find absolutely fascinating about the Hound and Sansa, is that they manage to have such a peculiar relationship in a castle full of people without anybody ever suspecting that these two could possibly have anything to say to each other. So if it is to be relevant later on, then yes I imagine it would be important to let us know Sansa hasn't forgotten him, quite the contrary (don't they say absence makes the heart fonder or something to that effect) and I believe it can be done in a reasonably subtle way. Let us hope!
2197	Zorn Gottes	2014-05-07	... and the fact remains also that book!Sansa also never talks about Sandor, to anyone. The difference is that we know Sansa's internal thoughts in the books.

Good point. But if they wanted to convey Sansa's feelings, they had the option to show that Sansa had kept his cloak, just like they did with the doll Ned gave her (during Blackwater, Sansa thoughfully snuggling the doll. Simple like that)
Â 
ETA: Instead, she is still wearing that damn wedding ringÂ

2198	DogLover	2014-05-07	So you don't like dark fantasy at all?
If you say you do then you are bullshitting... Dark story and Dark fantasy is filled with racism, blood, gritty and horrifying with all hope for the ''good guys'' is extinguished whilst the bad guys live and the moral grey people like the hound is the people who live in dark fantasy. look at the witcher, and at Game of thrones/Asioaf... It's like it is for a reason.


Â 
What?  Â Just because I don't like the way the writers are characterizing the Hound on the show has nothing to do with how I feel about dark fantasy. The writers have taken an incredibly complex character who struggles with his moral compass and reduces him to a one-dimensional brute while whitewashing Arya, who is far darker in the books. The writers are also incredibly inconsistent with their storyline. It's all over the place--more like each of their scenes are individual skits rather than one continuous and cohesive story.Â 
Â 


How is it that saying they reversed the characterization for the Hound and Arya on the show is not liking dark fantasy. It was actually more interesting with the woman being the darker character.
Arya and the Hound were heading in opposite directions in the books, Arya was heading where the Hound had been emotionally, and the Hound was heading away from that darker place. There was actually character development and a story taking place for Sandor (Arya even started calling him Sandor, imagine that, he has a name).
He had gone from hate driving him to love driving him, and that love was for someone Arya once loved, too. But she hasn't come up yet for some reason (even though he brought her up a dozen times in the books). Arya had lost those she loved and felt more and more like no one, hate was driving her now.
There was a last glimmer of who she once was with the Hound, maybe hating wasn't the way, maybe when you get to know someone, things don't look so black and white anymore. On to the House of Black and White.


Â 
Â 


Â 
So, you don't think it's possible DogLover likes, or has nothing against, dark fantasy, but actually dislikes bad dark fantasy?
Â 
Â 
Not really. Bad dark fantasy usually fits your description. Formulaic and vulgarly simplistic morality tales are just bad, even when the morality is turned upside down and "good guys" replace "bad guys" in the role of traditional losers. Thankfully, ASOIAF books are pretty far from that territory.


Â 
Exactly. Â
2199	Le Cygne	2014-05-07	So they matched the Jaime/Bronn scene here... they likey to do the matchy matchy.Another matching scene, they do like to do those:http://www.youtube.c...h?v=WRYM6B7CTs8

2200	Aerys Blackfyre	2014-05-08	not surprised at all!
2201	Talking Hodor	2014-05-08	I don't think the Hound slapping Arya was out of line.Â  He gave her one chance to demonstrate her fighting prowess, and she attempts to eviscerate him.Â Â  He disarmed her and subdued his attempted killer.Â  If anything, he did show restraint.Â  He also gave her an important lesson about fighting.Â  If he truly hated her, he wouldn't be trying to improve her fighting knowledge and skill.Â  He wouldn't really even be talking to her.Â  He respects her somewhat and probably would genuinely like her if she'd stop hating him.
2202	RedShirt47	2014-05-08	No, I wasnae too surprised. I expect the festering and parting to be in ep7. I think they will have the Hound and the Mountain "die" in the same episode.
I like the Arya & Hound scenes. Also They can't have Arya arrive in Braavos too soon. There isn't much for her to do there. I see her getting there in ep10 or so. Season 5 will easily get through her Braavos book material.
2203	JagLover	2014-05-08	Â I just hope they find a way to keep the Hound around longer in the show, they way they have done with Bronn
2204	Annara Snow	2014-05-08	No, I wasnae too surprised. I expect the festering and parting to be in ep7. I think they will have the Hound and the Mountain "die" in the same episode.
Â 


Â 
Well, then it can't be in episode 7, since episode 8 is called "The Mountain and the Viper".
2205	Envie	2014-05-08	Â 
Well, then it can't be in episode 7, since episode 8 is called "The Mountain and the Viper".


Â 
There will undoubtedly be many other scenes in the episode, not just the duel between Clegane and Oberyn Martell. Last week's episode was called "First of His Name" but had only one scene that even pertained to that (the crowning of Tommen). So yeah, saying the name of an episode predicts what stories are going to have scenes is not an accurate prediction.
2206	RedShirt47	2014-05-08	Â 
Well, then it can't be in episode 7, since episode 8 is called "The Mountain and the Viper".


my bad, that's the one I meant.
I can just see them have two scenes looking similar, one the Hound lying down wounded pleading with Arya to end it and the other the Mountain goading Oberyn.
2207	Zorn Gottes	2014-05-08	I expect the festering and parting to be in ep7.


Hmm I don't think so. The episode 6 teaser didn't feature any Arya scene, and one of the preseason trailers showed the "mercy" scene: I doubt they will put "mercy" in the same episode with the fight plus the festering plus the parting, as they usually focus on one event per episode. In my opinion it's likely that we will se "mercy" in episode 06 and the "death" in one of the last two episodes.
2208	Annara Snow	2014-05-08	Â 
There will undoubtedly be many other scenes in the episode, not just the duel between Clegane and Oberyn Martell. Last week's episode was called "First of His Name" but had only one scene that even pertained to that (the crowning of Tommen). So yeah, saying the name of an episode predicts what stories are going to have scenes is not an accurate prediction.


Â 
I wasn't predicting anything, RedShirt47 did, saying that it will happen in episode 7 because Sandor and Gregor will 'die' in the same episode. Well, Gregor is clearly not 'dying' in episode 7.
Â 


I seriously doubt it. Sophie said in a recent interview, Sansa doesn't love Tyrion, and on the recap said marrying him was the worst day in Sansa's life. If that were the case, Pod would end up with Tyrion. Shae would end up with Tyrion. Bronn would end up with Tyrion. Even Cersei would end up with Tyrion before this season. They've painted scenes of each of these characters with him FAR nicer than in the books, and them far nicer to him in return. The whole show is a love story between Tyrion/Westeros. When he goes to Essos, it will be Tyrion/Essos. Watch out, Jorah, you are about to lose your story, too.
Â 


Â 
Â 
Well, according to this poster, Sandor will end up with Tyrion, too! 
Â 
Sorry, I couldn't help it...

Well, then it can't be in episode 7, since episode 8 is called "The Mountain and the Viper".


Â 
Personally, I think episode 7 will be the discussion of mercy and the Hound receiving his wound. Arya will leave him in ep. 8, get on the boat in ep. 10 and arrive in Bravos at the beginning of season 5.

2215	DaughterOfThe9Moons	2014-05-10	I totally wasn't surprised by the scene although, like others, I found it out of (book) charachter. The Hound's depiction on screen differs so much from how I read him in the book that I have stopped myself from expecting too much from his scenes because, as a rule, I just find them disappointing.Â 
As he has been depicted on screen it made total sense for him to hit her. She was just asking for a slap back to reality.
Agree with the posters who said that she will be getting on the boat to Braavos in ep. 10. I think at that point Brienne and Pod will show up and see the ship departing the quay having no idea that Arya is on board. Perfect.Â
2216	Annara Snow	2014-05-12	Speculation on how things will go with Sandor and Arya in the next two episodes (probably episode 8) based on what we know about episode 7 from the preview:
Â 

	Spoiler 
So, now we know for sure that "Only Cat" is in episode 7.
Â 
It's long been speculated that the wounds Sandor receives will be from some knights from the Vale (since Donnel Weynwood was cast for this season). But why would he get into a fight with them, when he's planning to give Arya to her aunt Lysa and get the silver?
Â 
That's where the changed show timeline could get in handy - if he learns from the Vale knights that it's Lysa's widower Petyr Baelish who's in charge in the Eyrie, Sandor might change his mind and decide that he's not leaving Arya there in LF's tender care. That would accomplish both 1) finding a reason for a conflict with the knights, and 2) showing that he actually does care and it's not all about the money for him, whatever he is claiming his motives to be.


Â 
That's at least under the assumption that their characterization of Sandor this season will make some sense and be more in less in line with the book character as well as having some consistency with his earlier portrayal on the show. .
2217	Karmarni	2014-05-12	I still think Sandor will end as the book, he will receive a grievous wound and Arya will leave him for dead. But his characterization is way off the mark at this point, for the books and the show. I'm not sure how they can even bring their own characterization back on line. He seems to be shown in two different lights. How will they pull it together? I'm sorry to see him lose so much of his own story.

It's a speculation by another poster (RedShirt47) that Sandor and Gregor will receive their wounds in the same episode, although that has been speculated by other people, as well.
Â 
And no, you didn't sound rude or sarcastic.
2220	Sirar Salih	2014-06-16	Here is what I think is going to happen:
Â 
Brienne/Pod will cross roads with Hound/Arya. Brienne is looking for the Stark girls, so she demands that the Hound hand over Arya, the Hound refuses and an epic duel takes place between Brienne and the Hound. Brienne wins the duel and gravely wounds the Hound, Brienne then takes Arya with her and they leave the Hound to his death. Arya later escapes to Braavos where she becomes a faceless assassin.
Â 
This scenario makes Brienne a valuable witness against fArya later on.


Haha, I'm a genius
2221	Blazfemur	2014-06-16	I LOVE how they did the brienne interjecting with hound/arya. that battle was awesome, and i think that element of the show was better done than in the books. we had more hound time since the inn, and it ended in an epic fight, yet still ended exactly, how it should have.
Â 
im assuming briennes injuries from the hound start to overtake her, and thats when thoros finds her.
2222	kiasyd	2014-05-05	So, the show added another tidbit of fan service: The good old Syrio Forel vs. Meryn Trant debate! I was surprised to see that they kept it for quite some screen time and threw most arguments seen in forums until now!
Â 
What do you guys think? Personally this just confirms my own theory on the this matter: Syrio Forel unfinished demise was particularly devised by GRRM as a provocation to readers.Â  
Â 
Any thoughts or comments?
2223	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-05	Aww does that mean he's not waiting in Bravos for Arya?
Â 
Thing I didn't understand about that scene, his last. Was why he didn't pick up one of the metal swords. He had time. But since the first sword of Bravos doesn't run and Meryn Trant is alive it wasn't too much of a mystery. Unless Trant ran I suppose.
2224	Stone Cold Bastard	2014-05-05	I don't think Syrio would have been able to grab a real sword - Trant, the creep, probably would've stabbed him.
Â 
Speaking of which, I can't wait to see Meryn Trant get his just deserts. Such a scumbag.
2225	Ser Pigeon Pie	2014-05-05	The only thing I think which disproves this theory is that Meryn Trant is still kicking it in KL without any indication of losing a battle to a guy with a wooden sword! Unless of course.........
2226	Dain Storm	2014-05-05	Syrio is most definitely dead. Trant in the books isn't a joke(though he's no warrior of renown either), and the show made it pretty clear that all the skill Syrio had couldn't save him from superior arms and armor.
2227	MyLittleFinger	2014-05-05	Ser Meryn Trant has proven to be the best Kingsguard since The White Bull. Never balks at doing the royal families bidding, keeps all their secrets with staunch loyalty and is adept at harming unarmed people with maximum impact.Â
2228	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-05-05	This thread deserves a massive: WTF????
Â 
How do we know any more now than we did before? Â We witnessed a conversation between a girl who ran away before anything happened and a guy who'd never heard of Syrio.
Â 
For the record, the sounds that we heard during the showdown were metal hitting the ground followed by screams coming form multiple sources. Â If the show is hinting at anything it's that Syrio disarmed Trant and issued further punishment on his cohorts.
Â 
But again, that's what we knew back in S1, and at the moment we have exactly zero new information.
2229	ToTheWolves	2014-05-05	The only thing I think which disproves this theory is that Meryn Trant is still kicking it in KL without any indication of losing a battle to a guy with a wooden sword! Unless of course.........

2230	kiasyd	2014-05-05	Two points:
Â 
The "first sword of Braavos doesn't run" conundrum is easily resolved: Syrio isn't the first sword anymore - just a moment before the Lannister guards appears he teaches Arya by calling "left" and striking "right".
The Hound scornfully dismisses Trant as a lousy fighter - this info is new: so far in the books we haven't seen anyone show this kind of contempt for Trant... Jaime displayed some contempt but not like this.
Â 
Again, I defend the point I always had: Syrio's fate was left unresolved purposefully.

In the show only. Jaime in AFFC described Meryn as an adequate fighter, which would put him on par with the likes of Ned Stark in terms of fighting ability.

Â 
Yeah, especially one where Meryn Trant is actually Syrio, in which Syrio is, therefore, a massive douche and a toadie who beats up little girls and does everything Joffrey tells him to, and doesn't even feel bad about it or try to not hit Sansa too hard, like Arys Oakheart.

2238	kiasyd	2014-05-05	Guys, the focus here is about the intended provocation from GRRM & the show production as fan-service.Â  
Â 
I agree that the Syrio-faceless man theory is terrible; on the other hand I do think that other kinds of simple resolutions are feasible: Syrio dodges and shots for a double-leg takedown, grabs a Lannister half-helm from the ground, knocks Trant unconscious for one minute, and prances out through the door.
Â 
But my original point is not "Syrio is alive": My original point is that Syrio's fate is undetermined in order for GRRM and the show production have some fun with the fans.Â
2239	lostinwesteros	2014-05-05	I can't cite exact words, but I remember reading somewhere on the forum that when Martin was asked about Syrio, he kind of shrugged and said something like 'One man without armor and only a wooden sword against 5 men in armor with steel swords . . . He's human . . . what do you think?'  That's not firsthand, just what I remember reading a year or two ago.
Because of that, it just seems unlikely that they'd waste any screen time trying to get fans all worked up when there's so much else going on that deserves attention.  Arya had already mentioned Syrio the last time she talked with Jaquen H'gar, and in this past episode it gave a nice context to her water dancing out by the river, but I think if anything it prepares the way for Arya to depart for Bravos.  
If there's to be a tease for the fans, I'd say a more pertinent and realistic one is speculation about what  happened to Benjen Stark.

Â 
I get that all signs point to death, but simultaneously, I can't help but think Syrio survived the encounter, because Martin has never confirmed death.

He's the best KG ever because when Joffrey was dying, he was just there, watching.
2244	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-05-06	Like we always know from the books, if you hear people talking about a death, but don't see a corpse, that person is always dead.
Â 
It's fun to speculate. Â Trant in the books says something about almost grabbing "the Stark girl, until the dancing master interfered." Â Ambiguous.
Â 
Footnote:
Â 
In fantasy, I can only think of one "we didn't see a death, but there really WAS a death." Â From The Wheel of Time - Sammael's death confirmed by the author.

2245	GallowsKnight	2014-05-06	Trant killed Syrio. Despite being a master swordsman, Syrio had no way to harm Trant in head to toe plate armour armour. As the hound points out "Trant had armour and a big sword". It's evidence of how dangerous even an average knight is.
Â 
Trant isn't a terrible knight either. Like Boros Blount. He manages to beat Harwin of Ned's guard in the jousting.
2246	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-06	I'll remain blissfully ignorant that he is still out there somewhere, just like Benjen and Weasel.

2248	The hairy bear	2014-05-06	Syrio's fate was left unresolved because of the POV structure. George couldn't have Arya watching how he died and at the same time escape from Trant.
Â 
The best Martin could do to depict that Syrio was making a last stand was showing his situation as dire as possible. And he did: four men in armor are approaching him, and is wodden sword is already broken. It's obvious that George clearly intends to imply that Syrio is going to die.
2249	Annara Snow	2014-05-06	It is pretty well established trope in fiction Never Found the Body means the character is probably still alive.Â  Even in cases where "nobody could have survived that."Â

Â 

This is generally true. However,  Syrio is not a protagonist,  major supporting character or family member.  He is a very minor character, which is why GRRM probably never gave it much thought. 
Also, what  hairy bear  said.
2250	idler	2014-05-08	I think it depends on the status of a "First Sword of Braavos", as the exact title is. We didn't know that until 4x03 when Davos started to read the biography of Elyo Grivas. Syrio Forel introduced himself as First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos to Arya in 1x03, but in 1x08, he got the title right: The First Sword of Braavos does not run!
Â 
We know the Sealord is chosen for life and names a First Sword as he pleases. The present Sealord, Ferrego Antaryon, is "sickly and failing" for ages, and his First Sword Quarro Volentin runs business. That might well have been the same Sealord with a yellow cat on his lap that once hired Syrio Forel. So the "First Sword of Braavos" is not a mere bodyguard, but has actually responsibilities like a "Hand of the King". That's why there is a biography of Elyo Grivas.
Â 
So it brings Ser Meryn Trant into a dilemma, when Syrio Forel says "The First Sword of Braavos does not run!" (He even "forgets" to mention he's retired!). We may assume Cersei told him to seize Arya Stark - who is gone now anyway - and not to try and kill a high-ranking foreign politician and risk a war with a first-rate power like Braavos. Cersei might like to see his head on a spike right next to the Stark household.
Â 
So if he can take a breath and think it over, he will apologize. And Cersei will put the "Dancing Master" on the next ship to Braavos. As they well might have done, considering Syrio's head is not spiked with the rest of the Stark household. 
Edited for typo.

But wasn't it Sansa seeing the spiked heads of the Stark household? And iIrc she doesn't ever know Syrio, so wouldn't have noted his face. But there also was no mention of her, seeing a head, which former owner she doesn't know...

Why would Trant believe that a high-ranking foreign politician has been living in King's Landing unbeknownst to anyone and giving fencing lessons?
Â 
Moreover, at that point he's already (in the books) killed several Lannister guards; they aren't going to keep him alive after that.

One "side" says he was the greatest swordsman, blah blah blah and believes he's alive, the other"side"Â  that with no good weapon and no heavy armour blah blah blah he's dead.
In the end, the question is still not actually resolved of whether Syrio died (only that Meryn Trant is still alive).

2255	Envie	2014-05-08	I think D&D put the bit in there about Syrio between Arya and The Hound just to work up fans on forums just like this one. 
Â 
They're book fans too - they probably had a whole bucket list of minor characters they wanted to know what happened to while writing the show (Gendry, Coldhands, Patchface, etc etc) and from that bucket list they decided which characters would be important to cast each season and which ones would be dropped or never added because they did not advance the story in some important way.
Â 
Adding back in a line or two from Arya about Syrio doesn't mean he's still alive. It's just tying back in Arya's 'water dancing' routine so that when the Hound laughs at her and knocks her on her butt, the point is hit home, she's no warrior with that fighting style and better find another way to survive and kill her 'hit list' - which as we all know, is coming with her decision to go to Braavos. Television show only viewers have no idea what Arya's going to do and thus they wrote in some material to help tie it all together in the near future.

To be fair, the style a girl was demonstrating goes better with stabbing people where their armour is not.

It did occur to me Sandor's armor looked more like studded boiled leather armor and not plate - in which case one would think Needle could pierce it ... but I tried not to over analyze the scene too much. We can't really try to scientifically explain everything in a very fantasy oriented show.
2259	JonBranRickon	2014-05-08	The whole argument about the wooden sword has been taken as an absulote when it should be looked at as the weapon he started the fight with.Â  Syrio killed several men and I'm sure he was smart enough to pick up a real sword if he need to.Â  Also, if he is a FM like so many people believe than he would have had several other ways to kill and survive.Â 
Â 
Furthermore, Ser Meryn is notorious for not behaving like a knight,Â  he most likely ran after the odds were evened up.
Â 
I believe GRRM loves to make us think things as beiing much more complicated and eloborate than they appear but when you look at these two characters it seems pretty simple.

He would have to stop in the middle of the fight and stoop, at which point he would be killed.Â  Look at the way the show staged it.

Based on nothing whatsoever.Â  Syrio being a Faceless Man is totally contrary to the spirit of his character.

That's kind of a record!I don't think I have ever seen an interview with him, he seems due one!Meryn Trant has been in all five novels, and besides Jamie maybe the only surviving Kings Guard from, I don't know on the show we never really meet them all.It's not surprising that Sandor has little respect for anyone's abilities , even his brother.Still odd to bring it up on the show as they did.I hard to think that Robert would have appointed Trant if he was worthless as a warrior.As for ambiguity , I was sure the Hound had bit the biscuit, tho I have noticed , in the novels, when GRRm does not have a character die 'on-screen' there is always the thought of "I wonder what the hell happen to character?"

For the record, the sounds that we heard during the showdown were metal hitting the ground followed by screams coming form multiple sources. Â If the show is hinting at anything it's that Syrio disarmed Trant and issued further punishment on his cohorts.
Â 


Â 
Wow, you're totally right. Just went back and listened to this five or six times. As Arya is running down the stairs, you clearly hear a *whack* followed by a blade hitting the floor, and then slicing and stabbing and screaming. It doesn't sound like Syrio screaming, either. It sounds like Syrio carving up a room full of Lannisters with a real sword.Â
2263	boojam	2014-05-08	Syrio's fate was left unresolved because of the POV structure. George couldn't have Arya watching how he died and at the same time escape from Trant.Â The best Martin could do to depict that Syrio was making a last stand was showing his situation as dire as possible. And he did: four men in armor are approaching him, and is wodden sword is already broken. It's obvious that George clearly intends to imply that Syrio is going to die.Syrio defeats four armed guys , who surely were not in their position because they were total incompetents, and he can't run away from a guy encumbered by full plate?

Â 
Except - Trant is still alive ... and that's who he was squared off against when Arya ran away. So we can only assume that A) Trant killed him, or B Â ) Â Â He smacked Trant, knocked him out, then fended off a bunch of other attackers and took off himself. People have theorized this both directions since that scene and yes I agree the audio is quite misleading or else more purposeful trolling by the show producers.

And he did: four men in armor are approaching him, and is wodden sword is already broken. It's obvious that George clearly intends to imply that Syrio is going to die.In the books, it says the other men were dead or dying. They weren't armored as well as Trant. Looks like he's implying that's why Syrio had more trouble with Trant. He got the other five in all the spots they weren't armored, hands, legs, eyes, neck. So it was one-on-one in the end:Â A knight of the Kingsguard stood beneath the arch of the door with five Lannister guardsmen arrayed behind him... He was in full armor, but his visor was up... The red cloaks wore mail shirts over boiled leather and steel caps with lion crests...They had chainmail over their chest and arms, and steel codpieces sewn into their pants, but only leather on their legs. Their hands were bare, and the caps they wore had noseguards, but no visor over the eyes...Ser Meryn Trant ran out of patience. â<U+0080><U+009C>Take her,â<U+0080><U+009D> he said to his men. He lowered the visor of his helm...Five men were down, dead, or dying by the time Arya reached the back door that opened on the kitchen...She saw: the knight in his pale armor head to foot, legs, throat, and hands sheathed in metal, eyes hidden behind his high white helm, and in his hand cruel steel. Against that: Syrio, in a leather vest, with a wooden sword in his hand. â<U+0080><U+009C>Syrio, run,â<U+0080><U+009D> she screamed.â<U+0080><U+009C>The first sword of Braavos does not run,â<U+0080><U+009D> he sang as Ser Meryn slashed at him. Syrio danced away from his cut, his stick a blur. In a heartbeat, he had bounced blows off the knightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s temple, elbow, and throat, the wood ringing against the metal of helm, gauntlet, and gorget. Arya stood frozen. Ser Meryn advanced; Syrio backed away. He checked the next blow, spun away from the second, deflected the third. The fourth sliced his stick in two, splintering the wood and shearing through the lead core.

Or perhaps she did stick him a bit, and underneath that armour is a wound that is currently infecting. (I guess we only have to wait a few days to find out.)
Â

I hard to think that Robert would have appointed Trant if he was worthless as a warrior.


Â 
Â 
Trant is a Lannister appointee, and likely there because he is a "compromise" choice from the Stormlands. Not sure of how many non-book folks would know about a certain man knight named Horpe who was supposed to be there, but was denounced by Cersei and thus not appointed.

Tyrion to Bronn: "Next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him." Bronn doesnt give a damn wether Trant has armor or not. Well, at the Eyrie, he didn't give a damn for Ser Vardis Egen's armor, either.

???
Â 
Well, it involved 2 people... one of which may be dead before too long...
Â 
Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see any similarity at all. Â It wasn't a duel, Arya didn't poison 'Needle', to our knowledge she didn't even injure him (let alone kill him), there was no unrelenting "you rode him down, you killed him, you slung him over the back of your horse" chant. Â In what way at all was this even slightly reminiscent of Gregor v Oberyn?
Â 
If anything, should The Hound have received a would which will fester (which would be a tremendous letdown, IMO), it would emulate Khal Drogo in Season 1.
2279	courtjezteruk	2014-05-09	So put the words in the battle to one side, what i saw was an unarmoured opponent against an armoured one, one makes what could be a fatal strike on the other, the other then gets smacked in the head by a Clegane, ending the fight. Â It may be tenuous but i saw some similarities.

2280	Bannerman_Forrester	2014-05-09	Now this may be crazy, insane, and the most farfetched theory out there about our great Forel.....
Â 
What if, now bare with me, what if he was never the first sword of Braavos, instead he was the first sword of Bravado?
That is to say, he indeed was a humble, good guy, and a skilled fighter. Buuut he was a braavosian sellsword that Eddard found to impress his daughter?
This would also assist with the "He's dead" due to having a final stand to make sure the little girl wasn't hurt.
Â 
Now I don't recall how they described him in the books, but if culture is important to the TV series that would disprove the idea of him being a common Bravos, due to them wearing crazy colorful outfits to stand out. Qouting from the wiki "Officials of Braavos, called keyholders and justiciars, wear drab coats of brown and grey." Which if I recall, was exactly what Syro was wearing in the show.

Arya is doing the opposite, she's lost everyone she loves (her family), and is driven by hate (her kill list).When he dies, he doesn't mention Gregor at all, the Hound dies there, because he's been dying all along. He's been becoming Sandor again all this time, slowly but surely.So yeah, not seeing a Gregor parallel, in fact, the opposite.Also, checking out the promos, they seem to be getting along well enough in the scenes to come. In the books, she thinks of him as Sandor, too. Takes him off her list. Thinks, "I wouldn't have to kill him." Hopefully, the show will capture a bit of the subtlety.

The show's definitely going that way since they made it a point she has him on the list, and despite some people wondering why he wouldn't have heard it until now, clearly it's so the audience realizes she's deliberately taken him off the list a few episodes from now.Â

I think its foreshadowing Arya to Braavos more than anything else.Â  The Viper doesn't die because of "quick but no armor < slower in armor."Â  He indeed WINS because of that, like Bronn did, but ends up losing anyway.

No, I do not take it that Jaqen and Syrio are one in the same.
Both are from Braavos.
I guess I though that Syrio was the X-sword of Braavos, but what the hell that means I don't know.
Braavo, Brasvos, what the hell does it mean.


You got something mixed up. Jaqen H'ghar never claimed to be from Braavos.
"This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar, once of the Free City of Lorath. Would that he were home." The introduction in the show is similar.
Â 
As we learn in "Mercy", the author of "Wroth of the Dragonlords" and "The Bloody Hand" is a certain Phario Forel; we don't know wether that's a relative of Syrio (or even himself, considering a certain infiltration of Braavosi theater scene by the FM).
Â 
Besides several Keyholders and members of big families, Mercy sees the Third Sword occupying a box on the second level of The Gate, hosting a half-dozen friends.
Â 
Careful with the spelling of Braavos. Even the show mixes it up. "Waterdancing" is not the "Braavos - dance", but the "bravo's dance", as you can read in aGoT. And Needle is, as The Ned put it, "a bravo's blade" (meaning a bandit'.s blade).
Â 
We have the same error in the German sync and subtitles; well, the last time "bravo" was used in German literature was more than a hundred years ago, by Karl May.
2288	AryaSansa	2014-05-10	Syrio is alive!Â  End of discussion!Â Â  He's too good to be defeated by Meryn f*cking Trant, even with armor!

The introduction in the show is similar.But by the end of season 2 Jaqen revels he is a Faceless Man, the books mention no other place than the House of Black and White at Braavos where one can become a Faceless Man.In fact probably most of the FM are not from Braavos.One guesses most FM spend most of their time on the road on assignment.So far we have never found out just how many FM there are.Arya is not a Braavosi and she is training as a FM.One day Arya will say:"This woman has the honor to be 'Arya Stark', once of Winterfell of Westeros. Would that she were home."

Well, he tells us he had the position for 9 years, so in a port city like Kings Landing, there should quite a few people be able to identify him. A well-known impostor would be even worse than a well-known smuggler, so to say.

2302	About the Other Knight	2014-05-18	I think Ned being a seasoned fighter himself would recognize that a traditional fighting style woulds not fit Arya. Think Rob Roy, fencing incorporates speed and agility traits more suited to Arya. As for Syrio surviving, I think it is very possible, Trant's stamina would be wavering after chasing Syrio's dodges, feints and tumbles. After that Syrio could retrieve a weapon or at minimum get Trant off his feet and would have plenty of time to make an escape. I think as first sword of Bravos he would have experience dueling knights in full plate.

After that Syrio could retrieve a weapon or at minimum get Trant off his feet and would have plenty of time to make an escape. I think as first sword of Bravos he would have experience dueling knights in full plate.
2304	Talking Hodor	2014-06-04	In the show only. Jaime in AFFC described Meryn as an adequate fighter, which would put him on par with the likes of Ned Stark in terms of fighting ability.


Ned Stark and co. defeated Kingsguard, and good ones, at the Tower of Joy, despite being outnumbered.Â  Plus, he held his own against Jamie Lannister prior to getting double-teamed. I'd say he was an excellent fighter.
Â 
Tyrion badmouthed Meryn Trant in the show, telling Bronn to kill him if he uttered another word, which also made fun of his fighting prowess.
2305	Talking Hodor	2014-06-04	I think its foreshadowing Arya to Braavos more than anything else.Â  The Viper doesn't die because of "quick but no armor < slower in armor."Â  He indeed WINS because of that, like Bronn did, but ends up losing anyway.


The foreshadowing was in Tyrion telling Oberyn to at least wear a helmet.Â  A helmet might have saved him.

I suppose I wouldn't have put it that way if I hadn't just moments before assumed that the show makes sense on its own terms, but then checked a previous episode to verify my assumption only to find out the debt makes even less sense now. A way of projecting my own stupidity on others. Another delightful adventure of writing sentences in the magical realm of the world wide web

2322	acosta	2014-05-06	It's just an analogy to explain to Cersei the concepts of legal abstraction and limited liability since she doesn't seem to understand how a corporation works. The institution outlives any particular leadership group or physical location and debt never goes away until you pay it. I didn't get the sense he was trying to say they have a literal affiliation with another institution that uses a literal temple. He would have just said that. Tywin is not coy. 
That said, I still could have sworn someone in AFFC really does say the bank has been known to hire faceless men to assassinate sovereigns, but even if that is a false memory, it wouldn't be a terrible surprise. The only reason Robert doesn't use one is they're too expensive and we know the bank has the money.
2323	Lord Varys	2014-05-06	It's very likely that there is a connection between the Iron Bank and the Faceless Men - how else should the Iron Bank be able to arrange for the deaths of unwilling debtors? We know that they fund rivals and other claimants if a prince or king does not pay his debts. But even a bank as large as the Iron Bank would never have gotten this large if they had done this from the very beginning. Money alone does not win wars, after all, and just because they fund another pretender doesn't mean that he'll win or meet the terms of their agreement. And if we are talking of really large sums, unlimited credit to finance a war they would be risking very large sums indeed. The Iron Bank does not own all the money in the world.
Â 
It's much more likely that Iron Bank employs some sort ruse in the style of Varys/Illyrio back in Pentos. If a princely/royal debtor does not meet the banks demands, the Iron Bank does strike another deal with one of his rivals, which enables them to collect both the money they lent to the soon-dead-monarch and the new pretender with a lot of interest. After this treaty is signed, the Iron Bank dispatches Faceless Men to help the pretender to get into his kingdom/throne as soon as possible. Most likely by assassinating said king/prince and/or the people surrounding him.
Â 
This would especially make sense if the House of Black and White was the major shareholder of the Iron Bank. The Faceless Men must be enormously rich, considering what they usually charge for their assassinations, and they are clearly well-connected to any level of Braavosi society. Yet in none of Arya's chapter up until now was the Iron Bank flashed out. This strongly suggests that GRRM is saving this for later Arya chapters depicting her Faceless Men training.
Â 
As to Tywin's metaphor in the show: That was just stupid. A bank is a bank. It's a business enterprise. The guys working at the Iron Bank are cannot be all competent just because they work for the Iron Bank. If Tywin could replace an competent CEO with an incompetent CEO, the Iron Bank would not just operate as efficiently as before. It would make some sense for Tywin to be afraid if he knew of/suspected that there were connections between the Iron Bank and the Faceless Men. But he does not do this.

i say its something different...
Â 
just likely many belief systems, they believe in one God...the Bravoosi (im guessing) believe that the one true God is Death...and he comes in many forms, hence Many-faced god...at least that was my understanding...
Â 
im not sure on this, but the 7 "new" gods...dont they also believe that it is one God with 7 faces? I might be completely wrong on this but i really feel like that was mentioned
Â 
Rh'llor is just another God who is supposed to be Lord of Light and all things good and pure...
Â 
i realized GRRM blurs the lines between good and evil, black and white...but i doubt everything evil will end up appearing good while everything good will end up appearing evil (i've seen thread where ppl thinking WW's are the good guys and NW are evil and where Jon and Bran gona be on the side of the WW's fighting against evil Fire/dragons)
Â 
so in short, no I doubt they are the same...more like 2 different countries on the same continent who follow separate monotheist religions

I understood it the same way. To me it sounded like a hidden confirmation that the Iron Bank and the House of Black and White aka the Faceless Men are connected in some way. There's nothing wrong with reading between the lines. Although I must say that whole part of the dialogue sounded too much. What with this comprised of people / comprised of stones thing??? It sounds so wrong you could almost say the writer was desperately trying to find a way to brink up the temple analogy.

Wow, you're right and you know, that does sound a lot like the way the Faceless Men operate. Tywin is implying the people at the Iron Bank are not corruptible almost like they have no individuality that comes into play. Yeah this stone metaphor is definitely a hidden allusion to the Faceless Men, I'm totally convinced now.
Â

Â 
Well if you're looking for a financial connection the real question would be: since buying the service of the Faceless Men is so expensive, what do they do with all the money people are paying them? Surely not everyone is paying with their own life/their daughter's life. Rich people gotta be paying in actual money.
2349	ovis alba	2014-05-06	I saw it more as something connected to Cersei in the future.
Because she clearly turns down one temple (Iron Bank) and rather sides with a different one (Faith Militant) thereby basically ignoring what Tywin taught her here.

2351	Cubarey	2014-05-07	"As to Tywin's metaphor in the show: That was just stupid. A bank is a bank. It's a business enterprise.

Â 
Think you are missing the point. Te Metaphor of the "Bank" as a "temple" is meant to emphisize it's institutional nature. Institutions do not get scared and do not care about good or bad times. The Bank has lent money and expects to get paid back, if it does not, it does not, forget, forgive or give rainchecks it acts in whatever manner it believes will get its money back. If this king is unable to repay back the loan then maybe another king will try harder. It sets up the rationale forwhy the Bank would finance Stannis; not because he is the lawful claiment but because he will pay the debt back one way or anotther.
Â 
Â 
And the metaphor is not strange or out of place. As the Bank is the only other instituion outside of Temples that are timeless in their universe. Kings, dynasties, powerful families come and go but Temples (the Gods) and the Iron Bank are eternal.

2352	Tixu Oty	2014-05-07	Even if we're right that there's a clue behind the temple metaphor, it doesn't mean that Tywin is dropping us a clue, it doesn't mean that Tywin is aware of the connections between the House of Black and White and the Iron Brank of Braavos. In Tywin's mind it clearly means that the Iron Bank is a strong institution that can't be swayed. But it's very possible that in the writer's mind, there was a double meaning, that is a hint at a connection with the Faceless Men. Of course I don't think Tywin would know that.

The House of Black and WhiteÂ shows no outward appearance of being the training vehicle of the Faceless butÂ is only where people go to find a quick and painless death. From what weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen, the temple is manned with only a few that tend to the needs of the temple and those that seek out their own death. The HoBW shows no outward appearance of being the training school for the Faceless Men. Â However, when the Faceless gather at the House of Black and White, it appears to be in secret.Â  So, is it well known that the Faceless are from the House of Black and White?Â  How is a Faceless Man contacted? Who brokers the negotiation when the services of a Faceless Man are required? It seems the most likely source of contact and why it is known throughout both Westeros and Essos that the Iron Bank gets its due is because they are the point of contact with the Faceless. The Iron Bank has the resources to set the price and act as the enforcement to secure payment, something the House of Black and White would likely stay far away from. As was mentioned by Tixu Oty, there may be a known association between the House of Black and White and the Iron Bank.
2356	D_Richard	2014-05-07	That's the connection. You don't pay us, we'll back your enemies, provided they honor your debts, therefore your enemies kill you, if they fail, we'll send a FM to get the job done. Either way, you don't pay us, well valar morghulis as we say in Braavos lol

Â 
Actually I don't believe the connection, if it does exist, would be known to people at least not outside of Braavos. I took Tywin's metaphor more as a wink wink from the writer.
I don't think people who want to hire the Faceless Men do so through the Iron Bank either.
Â 
And to answer your question, yes, it is well known that the House of Black and White is the Faceless Men's headquarters, at least in Braavos, and at least well known enough that the sailor who takes Arya there knows to direct her to the temple. This coming from guys who were also very eager to let her learn all their names and give her gifts. So the sailors definitely knew that iron coin + valar morghulis = faceless men = house of black and white. At least that's how I took it.
Â 
However, I'm not sure how people would know how to hire a Faceless Men, but I assume it's not all that important. My guess: you may have to go to Braavos and know someone who knows someone...

Consider this from A Dance with Dragons:
Ugly Little Girl, Arya slips a House of Black and White coin in a man's purse:
"The kindly man understood. "And with that coin and the others in his pursse, he paid a certain man. Soon after that man's heart gave out. Is that the way of it? Very said?"

"That night they gave her back the face of Arya Stark.'
-George R.R. Martin
*The coin that went into the pool was a golden dragon of Westeros.
A coin from the House of Black and White went to the man , who is the 'hit', who has a heart attack.
By the way there is NOTHING but NOTHING mentioned, before , during or after, about that coin being poisoned.
At least I can't find it.
It was the sight of coin and the thought of being fingered by the FM that killed Mr. Insurance Man.
Arya got an acolytes robe for that.
Pretty clever!

This is nonsense. The coin was poisoned.
2361	boojam	2014-05-07	This is nonsense. The coin was poisoned.Can you cite the page and passage where that is said?
2362	clawson24	2014-05-08	I found the analogy a bit odd. It seemed like an overly involved and elaborate way of making it clear that the Iron Bank is not a good organization to screw over.

The exact way of killing the insurance man is never detailed. However, there are plenty of reason to assume he was indeed poisoned. Lots of emphasis on how the insurance man always bites the coins. Plus we know Arya learned about poisons in a previous chapter. It seems like the logical conclusion.
The heart attack option though doesn't sound that good. First, it is never said that the insurance man has a weak heart, merely that he's 50 something. Betting on a heart attack is definitely not a sure fire way to ensure someone is dead. Arya would be a fool if she had gone through all that trouble for such an uncertain result, and so the kindly man surely would not be telling her that she may not be hopeless.

Is that the way of it?

I do hope people would stop deploying it like it's a truth rather than a specific principle for a specific methodology for a specific practice.

Â 
Well right back at ya 
The panic heart attack option is certainly no more likely than the poisoning option.
Some hint - that you didn't bother to mention - could be found for your theory and there is a certain style to it. But in the end I just consider the fact that you can never know for sure that someone is going to have a heart attack vs. the certainty that someone will die from a well chosen, well dosed and correctly administered poison. So poison it is for me. Simple as that. I don't read latin but it doesn't seem like Occam would disagree.

One gets a heart attack and collapses dead, another ends up in the ocean and drowns, but the third man steers away and reaches the intended destination. He is a sailor, after all. The other two were a maester from Oldtown and a ruby merchant from Pentos. In a cold, dark cell, the sailor reflects on his life, which has been so full of hardship and struggle. He thinks of the glimmer of rubies and stares at his callous hands, silent.
2371	Talking Hodor	2014-05-08	Did anyone else get the significance of this and what implications might come from it?
Â 
The Iron Bank is like a temple...the House of Black and White is the Temple of the Many Faced God...where the Faceless Men train. Connection between the two confirmed? Maybe...or am I overthinking it.


Braavos is riddled with temples.Â  Even if this is to be taken as more than merely a simile, it's quite possible that the Iron Bank has religious overtones.Â  Could you imagine if that were the case nowadays?Â  Egomaniacal investment bankers now not only think they're God's gift to mankind, they are priests in control of all our money.Â  Ugh.

Solving the mystery is part of the fun. The fact that GRRM leaves so many ambiguities is enjoyable and what makes him a great author. He clearly does write with the intentions of leaving clues, but not to many of it, and we are definitely supposed to pick up the pieces and figure it all out. Plus we just love it.
2373	tsarrast	2014-05-08	The FM Organization is an extremely powerful one, with assassins that can literally change faces, that has reach the world over.
The Iron Bank has an absurd amount of money, is extremely powerful, has reach the world over.
Â 
They both are from the SAME CITY.
Â 
Without any hints at all, given the times, it's very plausible that the two interact together in some way, given that they have different domains (assassins/espionage vs. bank/money), yet could synergistically increase each other's power and reach.
Â 
I think it's very interesting to think about ways they are interacting... and I think at the VERY LEAST, the Iron Bank hires Faceless Men.
Â 
There have been a lot of subtle hints that it could be more than this... both being temples, using iron coins... but nothing definitive. Â I think it's possible the two are further intertwined.
2374	Omni	2014-05-09	I highly doubt that the Iron Bank has ever HIRED the faceless men. They might own and control them, but never hire them.
Â 
Why? What does it cost to hire the FM?
Depends entirely on who you are, if you're a begger with no money you pay with whatever you have, and that's enough.
If you're Tywin Lannister it'd probably cost you a mountain, full of gold ore.
Â 
And if you're the Iron Bank... well let's just say that no matter how much they'd gain by killing somebody through the FM, it'd likely cost them a hell of a lot more.
Â 
There are hundreds of temples in Braavos, they're probably completely unrelated.

2375	relish5k	2014-05-10	I absolutely see the two as being connected. If everyone is so afraid of the Iron Bank it has to be because it is a guarantee that those who mess with them will be destroyed. And the FM, as an organization, have quite a high success rate. Also, the FM when contracted out are quite expensive, and it's not like the House of Black and White is particularly flashy, so it would make sense if they're helping to fund the IBoB. All three branches - temple, bank, and assassins are based in Bravos and seem to have practical and philosophical ties.

I don't know about this.Â  The Iron Bank's slogan is "always gets its due."Â  Death is one of the surest ways out of monetary obligations.Â  I suppose your heirs can they be asked to fulfill the obligation, but that doesn't strike me as progress, more of a back up plan.Â  Intimidation would be progress.Â  However, the Faceless Men don't do intimidation.Â  They do death: quietly and typically made to look like an accident.
Â 
Hence, it appears when stuck with a delinquent, the Iron Bank funds their enemies in exchange for their enemy agreeing to take on the entirety of the debt.

However, I would not be surprised at all if the Iron Bank hired the faceless men throughout the ages, because the faceless men are seen as an elite force of people, and the Iron Bank seems like they aren't hurting for funds.Â

This makes the most sense to me. Might even be explained when Davos and Stannis get to Braavos.
2380	thoughtless711	2014-05-30	I love this idea- but maybe it's just because I see the Iron Bank like the wall street of westeros so I can draw that association. The "kindly man" does seem to have many connections of all sorts. I also find it odd that the season 5 casting sheets do not call for the "kindly man'- making me think we have already been introduced to him. They could of already cast him, surely, but Â if he's already someone we know my bets are on the "iron banker"Â Tycho Nestoris. It would be an awesome twist. I forget when he appears in Jon's POV in comparison with the 'kindly man'Â leaving Arya's...
Â 
The show might do it. As for the book- who the hell knows.

Â 
I don't think the kindly man ever leaves Arya's pov. I believe he will be (or already has been) cast as a specific character, since the calling sheets are still partial. But yes sure, you never know with faceless men so he could be someone we've already met. But Tycho? It sure would be a cool twist but I don't see it happening.
2382	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-05-05	At the coronation of Tommen there is a man standing behind Mace Tyrell, wearing a Lannister gorget and later is shown again speaking with Mace. Does anyone else catch this up? I hope, that this is indeed Kevan Lannister being back into the game. I would like to see him again this season, since most of his storyline was cut until now. Surely they have to bring him back next season after Tywin looses himself on the privy.
2383	lostinwesteros	2014-05-05	He figures in prominently later after Tywin is dead and Cercei starts rapidly decompensating, so I'm thinking we have to wait for all that.  Mace Tyrell hasn't figured in much up to now, either.
2384	Petyr Patter	2014-05-05	I would love for Kevan to be reintroduced.Â  I always felt like Kevan not sitting on small council meetings sort of made the Lannisters look more like a family instead of a HOUSE.
Â 
That being stated, I think if they were going to reintroduce him, they would already have done so.Â  I suspect he is an extra meant to reward those with careful eyes.Â
2385	shiola	2014-05-05	I love Kevan. Â I will have to rewatch, but I hope that was him.

2387	Carcetti	2014-05-08	I don't think it was him. His features are a bit off. That said, he is too important to omit from the story all together. I hope he will be introduced again next season. I also hope they will bring Lancel back and have Jamie visit him after he hears about Lancel's, errr, relations with Cersei. Would be an interesting sort-of-new father-son combo on the show

2389	acosta	2014-05-08	I don't see any way they don't bring Lancel and Kevan back next season, but they can easily wait until then and probably will.Â
2390	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-05-23	On a rewatch of Season 2, I noticed the same man from the crwod is sitting at the war council table at Harrenhal, as Tywin chides his cousin Reginald. So yes, he's obviously not Kevan.
2391	Eagle1	2014-05-14	I know that in the books Sansa thinks about the Hound after he leaves, and she even regrets that she didn't go with him. So lot of fans thought that instead of these inner monologues Sansa would share her thoughts with Shea. But as we know now after almost two seasons she didn't even lose a word about him (of course we don't know what she thinks). Do you think they won't meet anymore in the Tv show? Maybe the producers decided to end their "relationship" this way....

Â I said it in the main thread but I think the show is probably going to mention it a couple times because it is very unlikely show watchers really remember I guy who only appeared once as a corpse.  The episode reinforces that, since the the dialogue wouldn't have been different in episode ten.

2396	Newstar	2014-05-04	I liked it. I thought the reveal in the book--done through a long villain expository monologue as clunky as anything you'd find in the cheesiest James Bond movies--was horribly executed. This isn't a huge improvement, but at least it gets that revelation out of the way so that the tension and the momentum in the Moon Door scene won't be deflated by Lysa giving a long speech where she explains exactly at great length what her deal is. Ditto for the scene with Sansa where Lysa shows just how crazy and jealous she can be.

exactly what i thought. it makes complete sense for them to do it now, especially because if they save for it episode 10 and Only Cat it might get overshadowed by some of the other big twists at the end of the season, but the tension of the Only Cat scene did make the reveal in the books much more intense. im disappointed but i also understand.
2398	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-04	I have mixed feeling. On one hand thought it sucked that they chose to reveal it so early and just drop it in. On the other hand, they really do need to remind people of Jon Arryn. Besides, they will continue to reinforce and Sansa HAS to hear it as well.Â 
Â 
My worry though is that they are rushing with Sansa's storyline. Convinced more and more that Only Cat will happen in episode 7, which sucks big time.

Â 
I had thought it would be in episode 10, personally, to match up with all the other "climaxes" that will likely take place in that episode (Tyrion murdering Shae and Tywin, e.g.). They also need to introduce some sort of Marillion-type character to serve as a patsy, and it would make for a heck of a busy episode if the Marillion-type character's introduction, the snow scene, the confrontation, and the Moon Door scene all took place in the same episode.

This isn't a huge improvement, but at least it gets that revelation out of the way so that the tension and the momentum in the Moon Door scene won't be deflated by Lysa giving a long speech where she explains exactly at great length what her deal is. Ditto for the scene with Sansa where Lysa shows just how crazy and jealous she can be.


Â 
It really doesn't last that long in the books. Â And a monologue wouldn't be broken up with a lot of dialogue the way the Only Cat scene is. Â I guess I can see why it would be viewed as what you're describing, but I definitely disagree. Â It's a drunken lunatic raving, not a villianess explaining their top secret world domination plot.
2402	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-04	Not a fan, honestly. I had this very vivid image of how that whole part went down in the books, with Lysa getting more and more histerical, spilling more and more secrets, with the music getting louder and louder (kinda like the part in The Dark Knight when Harvey Dent is pointing a gun at Gordon and Batman)
Â 
Eh, I don't know, at least they offered something plot-important in an otherwise uneventful episode, so I guess that's fine
2403	shiola	2014-05-04	Â 
I thought it would be in episode 10, personally, but damn, they're burning through Sansa's storyline wayyyyy faster than I thought they would.


Â 
I thought it would be in episode 10 til we found out 7 is named after Littlefinger,Â and add the Jon Arryn reveal this week.. Â Seems pretty likely now.

You and GRRM have something in common.
2405	Lucamore the Lusty	2014-05-04	Let's not forget this TV scene was just between Baelish and Lysa. In the books Sansa also hear's Lysa's confession. So when we get to the Moon Door scene we'll still have the info revealed to Sansa for the first time.
2406	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-04	Not disliking it. Explains why Littlefinger is playing Lysa's "game" of marrying and loving her, because she knows too much. Also, is good to know that finally someone has LF grabbed by the balls. It was obvious that he didn't like her to openly say "I killed for you!!!" like she did.
2407	shiola	2014-05-04	Let's not forget this TV scene was just between Baelish and Lysa. In the books Sansa also hear's Lysa's confession. So when we get to the Moon Door scene we'll still have the info revealed to Sansa for the first time.

That's definitely true, and I realized it as well. Â I just don't think it packs the same punch though. Â It works better, to me, when it's a surprise to theÂ character as well as the viewer.

2408	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-04	Â 
Strangely, I'm not upset about the early Jon Arryn reveal necessarily. I'm upset about the omnipotence of Lysa's madness. I think what takes the "oh shit" out of "Only Cat" is front-loading Lysa's madness before it happens. She was a lot eviller to Sansa than she ever was to Cat in Season 1. She basically breastfed and gave the middle finger to Cat that she wouldn't help, while she's killing Sansa with lemon cakes tonight.
Â 
When you know someone is balloons crazy, you expect them to do just about anything. "Only Cat" isn't a reveal of just her as the murderer, but also a reveal and undeniable confirmation aboutÂ just how far her insanity extends.

Just reposting my thoughts for reference that may have got lost in the other thread.
Â 
also found telling Robin Alayne=Sansa bizarre. Harmless, but they went out of their way to address it lol. Weird.
2409	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-04	*Stops drinking to respond to this discussion*
Â 
I already voiced my complete and utter displeasure with this revelation being done now as opposed to later, but I will continue bitching now that you brought it up. 
Â 
The original revelation in the Snow Castle scene was jaw dropping to me because it really crystallized two important things to me: 1) The Lannisters aren't the root of all evil and 2) Littlefinger is.  From that moment on, I truly respected the brilliance of LF and his ability to plunge 7 Kingdoms into a civil war without so much as lifting a sword. It was totally a 'paradigm shift' to me. That it has been revealed in an almost inconsequential manner and without the benefit of really letting it sink it...I tell you, it gets my goat! *Drinks*
Â 
The more I think about it, however, the more I'm convinced it'll be stated again in the Only Cat moment, not for the benefit of the viewer's knowledge...but for Sansa's. Meaning, get that shocking moment out of the way for us as viewers...and then, when Only Cat happens, we can really focus in on Sansa's reaction to it rather than being shocked by it. Ugh. I hope that made sense.Â
2410	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-04	also found telling Robin Alayne=Sansa bizarre. Harmless, but they went out of their way to address it lol. Weird.


Â 
I think SW is a bit older here than in books. He probably knows how to keep a secret.
2411	Merysa Serrett	2014-05-04	It felt rushed to me. As my non-reader boyfriend pointed out, mouth agape at her confession, "that's what got this whole thing started." Jon Arryn's death was what kicked all of this off, and I felt like Lysa's confession was a really anti-climactic moment. I hope they'll do it justice in the Moon Door scene.Â 
Â 
I have my doubts about a Lady Stoneheart appearance. As much as I want to see it, I have a feeling that she may have been cut...
2412	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-04	Â

Â 
Yes and yes and yes. This. Times 1 million. I've 'seen' this scene so many times in my head that I can do an impromptu rendition of it if you asked me too. I get the feeling, though, that it's not going to go down the same way in the show and I'm quietly bracing myself for the massive heartache. Here's hoping I'm pleasantly surprised and it'll be...BETTER...somehow. Wishful thinking I know, but well, that's all I have at this point.Â  
Â 
Side note: Will they make them kiss on the show?
2414	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-05-04	i think episode 7 (or at least i hope) will have some stuff about lf being the lord. the lords of the vale that were cast are going to have something to say about that. it will be the start of the lords declarent.
the snow castle (or their substitute) might also be in ep 7, but i think only cat will be in ep 8 or 10, most likely 10
2415	Hoo	2014-05-05	I don't read the books, and I don't understand what the reveal is. Â they simply explained that Balish was behind it, no?
2416	Audrey Arryn	2014-05-05	I think they really need to do a "what happened on the last episode" before each episode. It would have been good to remind viewers of the scene where Catelyn receives the letter about Jon Arryn's death, its been 4 years since season 1 and people that don't re-watch shows may have forgotten.
2417	Rockroi	2014-05-05	I think they needed SOMETHING to be in this episode (because it was relatively vacant). Â They added in a major story item in an episode that was very sparse on stuff we did not already know. Â Arya is sick of the Hound, Jon and Bran are not together, Cersei misses Marcella and Tommen and Margery are going to be wed- we knew all this [to a degree] before. Â They really needed SOMETHING to seem important in this episode, and in this episode, Lysa Aryn admitted to murdering her husband, the first of the dominoes. Â 
Â 
And, I understand why else they did it this week. Â 
Â 
If they waited until Lysa was slain, it would be at the very end of the season (possibly the very last episode) and there is a chance that a gigantic plot piece would have been glossed over in the final scenes of the final episode for ... 42 weeks. Â Its possible that such a large item could be washed away by the other shocks in the scene. Â 
Â 
Even if they do a "Previously on GoT" at the start of episode \9 or 10, Lysa's death will almost assuredly be at the very END of the episode, and ts possible people would not remember it nor care. Â 
Â 
Frankly, I thought it was fine, Â
2418	Dragonglass Order	2014-05-05	Â 
Side note: Will they make them kiss on the show?


Â 
I highly doubt they will kiss, because Sophie was still 17 at the time of filming. Â Maybe a kiss on the cheek?
2419	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-05	I think they really need to do a "what happened on the last episode" before each episode. It would have been good to remind viewers of the scene where Catelyn receives the letter about Jon Arryn's death, its been 4 years since season 1 and people that don't re-watch shows may have forgotten.


Â 
They do have "previously on" segments that run before the opening theme song/credits that serve to prime the audience for certain plot elements/characters being re-introduced and tonight they did indeed show Ned/Cat/Luwin getting the letter from Lysa.Â  At least, they do here in the U.S.
Â 
I assumed every audience got them but apparently not?
Â 
Maybe people streaming them literally only get the episode and don't get the "previously on" before and the "next week on" after?
Â 
It's really too bad if these are missing, they are as useful as you'd expect (even at the cost of kinda giving away what's coming, at least for a book reader who sorta knows to expect)

2420	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-05-05	I honestly didn't care too much. I thought it was okay, made sense. There are plenty more things to nitpick at.
2421	acosta	2014-05-05	Honestly, this is a reveal that is not possible without clunky exposition, however and whenever you do it. It works and overcomes the unreality of it because it's so shocking when you first find out and realize Littlefinger has been playing the ultimate long game and is the man behind the curtain, not because it's actually a good scene, in either the book or the show. It obviously can't pack that same punch when you already know the truth.Â
2422	Gneisenau	2014-05-05	Honestly in this episode after the Lysa confession and the strangling Sansa scene, I was expecting the only Cat part to be in this episode too.

Â 
Before the season started I was CONVINCED that they HAD to make them kiss. Otherwise, how would Lysa get jealous and be provoked enough to throw Sansa out of the Moon Door? Watching these latest developments though, I don't think they'll do it. I think her jealousy has been firmly established already and all she has to do is HEAR Petyr telling Sansa something to the effect that he "wants" her, or is in love with her, and that'll be enough.

He already kissed Joffrey in season one. He was 18, I think. Or about to be.
2431	Colonel Green	2014-05-05	I highly doubt they will kiss, because Sophie was still 17 at the time of filming. Â Maybe a kiss on the cheek?


I really don't get why people are so convinced they aren't going to kiss.Â  Did you miss the gang-rape scene they filmed with Sophie in season 2?Â  There's nothing unusual about 17-year-olds kissing much older actors in TV/film.
2432	ambi76	2014-05-05	On the one hand I'm sad, because that was really an epic reveal in the books with Lysa babbling hysterically away.

That sounds like a problem on your friends' behalf, not a lack of explanation from the show. The Unsullied I've seen understood what it meant, but it wouldn't surprise me that more casual viewers wouldn't bat an eye at the exchange.
Â 
I'm fine with how it was revealed. It actually shocked me because I didn't expect it to be dropped right then, so I had a little chuckle to myself.
2435	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	Wouldn't it be awesome if Sansa did the pushing? I could easily see Lysa being loose-lipped about what happened to Jon and Sansa finally deciding enough is enough.
2436	Colonel Green	2014-05-05	Wouldn't it be awesome if Sansa did the pushing? I could easily see Lysa being loose-lipped about what happened to Jon and Sansa finally deciding enough is enough.

2437	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	That wouldn't make any sense; why would she kill Lysa but then go back to working with Littlefinger?


Lysa would basically say "I did it" (in a more elaborative fashion) but not fully explain why. Sansa would keep to herself what really happened to Lysa (Petyr, Lysa attacked me, she went crazy!!) and without Littlefinger knowing, work to kill him from the inside out. Check LF's face, he basically wants Lysa gone and the power of the Vale for himself, her dying wouldn't upset him nearly as much as anyone knowing about the plot.

2448	Lord Damian	2014-05-05	Well, I am glad that viewers are getting to see that it was Littlefinger who essentually started the war between Stark and Lannister. Ask yourselves this though, which I have presented in the book forums. The timing of Jon Arryn's death stopped him, Jon from telling Robert about the twincest. Littlefinger had to be doing Cersei's bidding or he, through spies, knew Jon was about to do this or even Jon confided in Littlefinger like Ned did. What do you think?

I feel like GRRM picked his moment well to drop the bombshell. Lysa was a raving madwoman by the point she (almost offhandedly) confessed to the murder. There was an urgency to her situation and it felt like a good time she could reasonably let it slip, while here she was just listing off crimes to remind Littlefinger she'd committed them.

No way. My wife hasn't read the books, and she was S H O C K E D ! out of her chair. "What?!!" she screamed..."Pause it, we must discuss!" The reveal was perfectly shocking, big, revealing, and stage-setting for her. Those of us who have read the books may find it hard to accept, but there are lots of good ways to tell a similar story differently. This worked for me as a reader, and my wife as a newbie. I'm sure Only Cat will be as awesome!
2452	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-05	Â 
Â 
Same. Sansa doesn't know, but now the fans do, so the impact of the later Moon Door scene is lessened.

The big part about only cat is the line "only cat" and the shove. 
The Jon Arran reveal could have came anywhere. 
It's lysa going mental and LF murdering her that makes it stand out. 
IMO of course.
2453	jessieomc	2014-05-05	My take on how things will unfold:
Â 
Littlefinger will have a 'moment' with Sansa (be it a kiss or a conversation along the lines of 'you look so much like your mother who I still adore') and an already insecure and jealous Lysa will see/hear. She will confront Sansa in the throneroom with the moon door and start her crazy Lysa ranting and be all like " I'm the one who killed my husband for him, I would do anything for Petyr etc...." hence revealing the truth to Sansa, them Petyr busts in puts the "Only Cat" on Lysa and makes her fly 
Â 
I do hope they keep the snow castle scene too, if only to show what a little shit Robin is.
2454	R'hllor the Fabulous	2014-05-05	Maybe I don't give show watchers enough credit, but I doubt most of them remembered who Jon Arryn was at this point.
2455	aFeastForDragons	2014-05-05	They just blurted this out. I doubt 90% of show watchers even figured out the significance of this reveal.

Â 
I'm personally really bummed. Â I thought it was a huge part of the momentum in the "Only Cat" scene... Â And now that shock value is gone. Â 


Â 
I liked it, and didn't see any problem with it. Â Without a Lysa or LF POV we don't know how often she brought it up to LF in private. Â But it seems likely that she would have, especially when she is feeling especially unstable, and it would only contribute to LF knowing he has to get rid of her ASAP.
2457	NaarioDaharis	2014-05-05	I honestly always thought this was a poor scene even in the books.
Â 
It made more sense, given her hysterical nature, to blab all that information to Petyr, but it was also a bit of a letdown that she was the culprit.
Â 
That is my opinion. I don't necessarily consider it to have been a wrong choice, but this reveal, and the reveal of Joff as being responsible for the assassin, seemed like cop-outs to me.
Â 
I got the feeling that GRRM had these two crimes occur, but wasn't particular determined on who had done it yet, and by the time he got to these scenes, he realized he could tie those loose ends to characters who were about to be written off anyway. Both of the reveals come just before their death, so they never have to deal with the consequences of their actions, which means George also is spared from dealing with the consequences.
Â 
Again, that is just my opinion. I have no evidence or reason besides what I've already stated to feel this way. Its just a gut feeling that it was a cop-out.Â
2458	Korgan	2014-05-05	I have my doubts about a Lady Stoneheart appearance. As much as I want to see it, I have a feeling that she may have been cut...

It made more sense, given her hysterical nature, to blab all that information to Petyr, but it was also a bit of a letdown that she was the culprit.
Â 
That is my opinion. I don't necessarily consider it to have been a wrong choice, but this reveal, and the reveal of Joff as being responsible for the assassin, seemed like cop-outs to me.
Â 
I got the feeling that GRRM had these two crimes occur, but wasn't particular determined on who had done it yet, and by the time he got to these scenes, he realized he could tie those loose ends to characters who were about to be written off anyway. Both of the reveals come just before their death, so they never have to deal with the consequences of their actions, which means George also is spared from dealing with the consequences.
Â 
Again, that is just my opinion. I have no evidence or reason besides what I've already stated to feel this way. Its just a gut feeling that it was a cop-out.Â 


The reveal isn't just Lysa, though, it's Littlefinger's participation that is more important, and that most definitely matters going forward.
2462	AnotherCrannogman	2014-05-05	I bet Lysa only lasts an episode or two more. They might make her more nuts and let Sweet Robin suckle (has that.happened in the show? ) and then she flies. I like Sansa doing it with LF urging her on.

Â 
Sweet Robins suckle happened back in season 1
2464	~No One~	2014-05-05	Throwing in my two cents....
I generally wish they would stick to the books (because the material is so great, so why change it?) but I understand some changes they've made for logistical reasons. That said, I didn't mind this change at all!
This entire episode seemed to have a thread of two-faced-ness to it. Dany isn't a good queen like she thought, Pod isn't as useless as he seems, Arya isn't as good a fighter as she thinks (yet),  the Lannisters aren't as rich as they seem, Marge definitely isn't sad like she seems (wearing black), Locke isn't a Brother as he seems, and SANSA ISN'T SAFE AS SHE SEEMS.
I think that's why the reveal came, to fit with the theme. I don't mind it here, even though I think the Unsullied would have understood just fine if it had been revealed right before the Moon Door, and not "gotten lost" as some might think. It didn't gloss it over for us book readers, and we understood just fine. But we also don't have themed hour-long episodes.
I do believe that when Lysa sees the snow castle scene (kiss or no kiss, she's bat-sh*t crazy) she will throw her hissy fit and recap killing Jon for LF before going for a flight. That will show how far LF is willing to go to get what he wants, which by that time will be evident to include Sansa. 
Sorry this got so long.

let us wait until Brienne finds out what Pod is really good at
2469	igrewupinKL	2014-05-05	It probably builds up tension as well, In the books LF makes Lysa fly after she blurts it out to Sansa once, but if they make it out as if she could be a liability in LFs play for the throne then it would make sense as to why LF was so ruthless about it, give LF more cause.
2470	Jairion Lannister	2014-05-05	I'd have preferred if they stuck to the book, but I understand why they did it. My guess is that they knew the Only Cat moment will already be massive. It'll be a big episode where Tywin dies, Bran probably meets the three eyed crow and Jon is elected as LC of the NW. In that context, along with Lysa's murder, the reveal of Jon's death will seem fairly minor when it should be seen as important. In this episode, however, which won't be seen as the biggest of the season by any means, it's a fairly big reveal which people will remember. I imagine Lysa will still mention the death in the final episode when she's about to be killed, so Sansa knows.
2471	~No One~	2014-05-05	It probably builds up tension as well, In the books LF makes Lysa fly after she blurts it out to Sansa once, but if they make it out as if she could be a liability in LFs play for the throne then it would make sense as to why LF was so ruthless about it, give LF more cause.

I agree, it totally builds tension, especially for poor Sansa. I mean, Alayne.
I do think that LF always had the intention of killing Lysa, though. You can see that he barely wants to touch her.
2472	Shitmouth the Wise	2014-05-05	I figured it was coming, so IÂ told my non-book reader brother to pay close attention to the "previously on" segment.Â  He did, he remembered Jon Arryn, and then his jaw dropped at the revelation.Â  So...it had the "shock effect"Â on at least some viewers...
2473	Stannis the Menace	2014-05-05	Jon Arryn Reveal?
2474	Wunhopkuendo	2014-05-05	I honestly don't think any show-only viewers knew what the fuck she was talking about.


I think the problem with book readers is that they think they are so smart and that only they could figure out what is going on in the story. In reality, as I constantly hear the same complaints that the viewer only folks won't understand ______, the viewing audience must be much smarter than the book audience in order to understand all of these supposedly impossible to understand plot points and reveals without reading the books. Maybe it's time for a reality check there book readers. Perhaps we are the dumb ones and the viewers are the smart ones.

Â 
Well to be fair the plots and backroom games with all the houses, characters and locations are not so easy to grasps by watching episodes of the show. They have simplified things a bit, cut unecessery passages and characters but still if you are a casual viewer, and didn't watch the show 5 or 6 times so far you will miss some things inevitably.
Â 
That was the case for me, I watched all 3 seasons before going for the books. Some things became clearer while reading, especially from a character POV. Now I have a much better grasp of the show and it's subtilities.
Â 
But they are doing a great job to adapt such exhaustive and lenghty materials on TV and GRRM contribute to scenarios which is interesting. It's not perfect but nonetheless of very good quality.

2476	Stannis' shadow babies	2014-05-05	I liked it. Most non readers caught it. Not a few of them are forseeing Petyr 
	Spoiler killing her

Besides, it doesn't mean that they won't bring it up again, later. I hope it's via Petyr himself, a la 'chaos is a ladder' speech.
2477	~No One~	2014-05-05	Pod isn't as useless as he seems,
Â

Baahahahaha!
2478	Weeping Sore	2014-05-05	I have my doubts about a Lady Stoneheart appearance. As much as I want to see it, I have a feeling that she may have been cut...


Â 
Arya conspicuously had Thoros of Myr and Beric Dondarrion on her death list in this episode, implying we'll see them again, and the perfect context would be the intro of Lady Stoneheart.
2479	Grody Brody	2014-05-05	I am like... 90% confident it will be in episode 7.


Â 
Agreed. It's called Mockingbird. Haven't they cast someone as Bronze Yohn Royce? I reckon Sansa's storyline this season ends with Littlefinger bargaining his way out of trouble with the Vale Lords (remember that meeting where he had someone draw a sword? I forget the details) and the show laying it on even thicker with Littlefinger being a creep who wants to bang Sansa.
Â 
Which puts the show very close to the books... dun dun dun! Maybe the "controversial" Sansa scene that's supposed to be in TWOW will even turn up this season? DUN DUN DUNNNNN!!!!
Â 


I liked it. I thought the reveal in the book--done through a long villain expository monologue as clunky as anything you'd find in the cheesiest James Bond movies--was horribly executed. This isn't a huge improvement, but at least it gets that revelation out of the way so that the tension and the momentum in the Moon Door scene won't be deflated by Lysa giving a long speech where she explains exactly at great length what her deal is. Ditto for the scene with Sansa where Lysa shows just how crazy and jealous she can be.


Â 
Disagree, I think that Moon Door moment was the best. I liked it better than the Red Wedding, in fact, because it was such a surprise and yet was telegraphed so subtly; it tied up a few loose ends while completely upending everything we thought had happened. Magnificent, and Lysa's speech worked very well I thought: she was drunk, she was crazy, and she was madly in love with a man who didn't love her back. She probably knows, deep down, that he doesn't love her, and was constantly trying to do things to remain in his favour, hence agreeing to murder her husband - something she probably felt deeply guilty about. All of which adds up to her needing reassurance from him that she did the right thing, and that he still loves her - pathetically trying to bargain for his love by reminding him of the things she's done for him. And drunk and crazy enough to be reckless with it, too.
Â 
And Littlefinger, being a man who knows how to roll with the punches, decided to deal with it there and then. Fuck, what a brilliant moment
Â 
Handled slightly meh-ly on the show, but I guess nothing's perfect, and they're worried the average viewer won't remember Jon Arryn. Plus, this is the first time we've seen Lysa since season 1; in the books, it takes a few chapters for Lysa's craziness around Sansa to come to a head, but I guess they're pressed for time and wanted to stick to the important bits. We'll still see Littlefinger cracking on to Sansa and Lysa's jealousy growing to bursting point, and then she's out the window in episode 7.
Â 


They also need to introduce some sort of Marillion-type character to serve as a patsy, and it would make for a heck of a busy episode if the Marillion-type character's introduction, the snow scene, the confrontation, and the Moon Door scene all took place in the same episode.


Â 
Well, I'm sure they could work around that, e.g.:
Â 
- "Guards, guards! Lady Lysa just jumped out the Moon Door!"
- "Guards, guards! Lady Lysa got drunk and fell out the Moon Door!"
- "Guards, guards! A bloody big bird just swooped in and pecked Lady Lysa to death! And then scooped her up in its claws and flew away, and also it cleaned up all the blood. Look, there it goes! Did you see it? Oh, you must have just missed it... Ah well. (exhales) That was fucking crazy, eh? Who's Lord now? I guess it's me."
Â 


Not disliking it. Explains why Littlefinger is playing Lysa's "game" of marrying and loving her, because she knows too much. Also, is good to know that finally someone has LF grabbed by the balls. It was obvious that he didn't like her to openly say "I killed for you!!!" like she did.


Â 
Yeah, it's a shame we lost the surprise of it, but then this show's always been much more up front about Littlefinger's importance and villainy, and it's mostly worked very well.
Â 


The more I think about it, however, the more I'm convinced it'll be stated again in the Only Cat moment, not for the benefit of the viewer's knowledge...but for Sansa's. Meaning, get that shocking moment out of the way for us as viewers...and then, when Only Cat happens, we can really focus in on Sansa's reaction to it rather than being shocked by it. Ugh. I hope that made sense.Â 


Â 
If Sansa's knowledge of the truth of the Arryn poisoning is important in and of itself - rather than her just being the vehicle for the audience discovering that knowledge - then that points the way towards her somehow taking advantage of that knowledge in the future... Does that make sense? I'm saying, in the books, Sansa finds out because we, the reader, have to find out, and she's the only POV in the Vale - but it doesn't mean that she'll do anything with that knowledge. On the show though, they're not sticking to the POVs, so they can give us that knowledge whenever - which they just did. So if they make a big deal out of Sansa specifically being the one to hear that knowledge, that signals to me that her knowing that knowledge will have some kind of importance/prominence within the story.
Â 
Sorry for my appalling writing but hopefully you get the gist

Please, this one. Oh please, oh please.
2481	Haymaker	2014-05-05	Honestly, this is a reveal that is not possible without clunky exposition, however and whenever you do it. It works and overcomes the unreality of it because it's so shocking when you first find out and realize Littlefinger has been playing the ultimate long game and is the man behind the curtain, not because it's actually a good scene, in either the book or the show. It obviously can't pack that same punch when you already know the truth.Â 


Â 

^ This.Â 
Â 
Although surprised they decided to reveal it this early, my wife, a non-book reader, had that awesome shock reaction of sitting up to the edge of the couch and proclaiming, "Wait, whaaaat?! Holy shit, Littlefinger was behind it all?!".Â  So I was satisfied with the scene. Â
2482	Qhorin Halfhand and Yoren	2014-05-05	Horrible, just horrible way to reveal it.
2483	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-05	No way. My wife hasn't read the books, and she was S H O C K E D ! out of her chair. "What?!!" she screamed..."Pause it, we must discuss!" The reveal was perfectly shocking, big, revealing, and stage-setting for her. Those of us who have read the books may find it hard to accept, but there are lots of good ways to tell a similar story differently. This worked for me as a reader, and my wife as a newbie. I'm sure Only Cat will be as awesome!


Yea I had a similar experience with my friend. I personally feel like the reveal could've been better, but considering about a million awesome things are going down in the last few episodes, I really don't mind moving up something this important. It added more flavor to the episode for me, whereas episode 10 will have plenty of flavor as it is. At least now my unsullied friends can understand when I tell them LF is arguably the smartest guy in the series.Â
2484	Seneti	2014-05-05	Not disliking it. Explains why Littlefinger is playing Lysa's "game" of marrying and loving her, because she knows too much.

Â 
Great observation. Baelish did look like he wanted to murder her right there for openly talking about their secret #1.
Â 


i think episode 7 (or at least i hope) will have some stuff about lf being the lord. the lords of the vale that were cast are going to have something to say about that. it will be the start of the lords declarent.
the snow castle (or their substitute) might also be in ep 7, but i think only cat will be in ep 8 or 10, most likely 10


Â 
Agreed. I think some of th scenes from the book might get shuffled around a bit. We will meet the Lords Declarant in episode 7. They will be introduced to us, Alayne will be introduced to them and we might get the first hints of resentment (Why weren't we invited to the wedding? Why this weird minor lord? Who's gonna marry Robin?) Snow Castle might be in ep. 4.07 or 4.10, but I'm pretty sure that "Only Cat" will still be in ep. 4.10.
Â 


Â 
They do have "previously on" segments that run before the opening theme song/credits that serve to prime the audience for certain plot elements/characters being re-introduced and tonight they did indeed show Ned/Cat/Luwin getting the letter from Lysa.Â  At least, they do here in the U.S.
Â 
I assumed every audience got them but apparently not?
Â 
Maybe people streaming them literally only get the episode and don't get the "previously on" before and the "next week on" after?
Â 
It's really too bad if these are missing, they are as useful as you'd expect (even at the cost of kinda giving away what's coming, at least for a book reader who sorta knows to expect)


Â 
Yeah, I remember German TV doesn't always have them (I think the pay TV channel that shows them first does, the free channels that show them later don't). Even so, "previously on" segments tend to bbe mostly filler on a lot of other shows, so most people I know use them as one last "grab-a-drink-and-take-a-leak" break before the show starts. Kind of comes back to bite you in the ass if you do that with GoT.
Â 


I really don't get why people are so convinced they aren't going to kiss.Â  Did you miss the gang-rape scene they filmed with Sophie in season 2?Â  There's nothing unusual about 17-year-olds kissing much older actors in TV/film.


Â 
Agreed.
Â 


This entire episode seemed to have a thread of two-faced-ness to it. Dany isn't a good queen like she thought, Pod isn't as useless as he seems, Arya isn't as good a fighter as she thinks (yet), the Lannisters aren't as rich as they seem, Marge definitely isn't sad like she seems (wearing black), Locke isn't a Brother as he seems, and SANSA ISN'T SAFE AS SHE SEEMS.

Â 
You mean: If they do repeat the reveal for "Only Cat" in front of Sansa, it means that information will be critical for Sansa's development and the advancing of the plot and if not, then we won't get a second reveal and "Only Cat" will revolve entirely around Lysa's jealousy?
Â 
Sounds good to me.
2485	MercyTheBlindUglyLittleCat	2014-05-05	I feel mixed, we lost something, but it may be for the better. I won't know til I see how Only Cat plays out in the show, without the reveal being part of it.
2486	Dragonstoned	2014-05-05	I think people saying that lots/most of the unsullied didn't 'get' the Jon Arryn reveal in this episode are wrong, and the reason it was brought forward was because if it came out in the stream of Lysa's hysterics in the 'Only Cat' scene then people definitely wouldn't 'get' it (still don't think it was worth bringing it forward though because it dilutes that scene, but reserving judgment until we see it on screen).
2487	lostinwesteros	2014-05-05	I was a bit shocked at the reveal coming so suddenly and blatantly, but then it did seem characteristic of crazy, Lysa's impulsivity and poor judgment, same as telling Sweet Robyn Sansa's identity.  Do we seriously think SR will be able to keep that secret?
2488	Miss Carnahan	2014-05-05	Disappointing. I remember how surprised and pleased I was by the sudden revelation in the "only Cat" scene. It feels like they deliberately want to keep Sansa in the dark. Then again, it might be repeated in 4x07 (though it will miss its effect, if that's the intention).

2492	Colonel Green	2014-05-05	She portrayed Lysa as a loving aunt so that the "Only Cat" scene would be more shocking.


After Lysa going bug-eyed in the subsequent scene with Sansa, I don't think anybody will be shocked that she tries to kill her.

2493	Inv1ctus	2014-05-05	The scene was short and not really dramatic, but any Unsullied who is half decent fan of the show absolutely knew what was being said and what kind of weight those words carry. For people who don't even remember the character of Jon Arryn from season 1, I doubt very much could be done for them. "Previously on GoT" would help somewhat but then they would have to include many other things too. It's an epic universe, if you just watch it week after week not really thinking about it, and then at the end of the season forget about the show for 40 weeks, you won't know anything about it. I started watching the show before I read the books, and in addition to the show I was also looking at some maps and family trees and I read occasional background story for some family and my understanding of this universe was much better.Â
2494	ToTheWolves	2014-05-05	All the show watchers I know & all the unsullied reviews I have read and watched on youtube there all SHOCKED.
The people I know caught it right off the bat. I think it may be a level if interest in the story or how well the episode held their attention b4 the reveal.
So give the show watchers some credit the reveal didn't fly completely over everyone's head.
2495	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-05	Â

I see, I see. Good way of looking at it. I can get on board with this analysis.
2496	cronnyberg	2014-05-07	I personally would absolutely love it if 'Only Cat' was delayed untill the last few minutes of episode 10, allowing Lysa's jealousy to get creepier and creepier throughout the season, finally culminating in the pivotal moment, and then immediately followed next scene by the Lady Stoneheart reveal!

I think you'd be hard pressed to find someone on these boards who  doesn't  want S4 to end this way 
Â 
What's the"only cat" scene?
Are spoiler tags needed to answer this? Dunno.
	Spoiler  LF reveals to Sansa & Lysa that he's loved only one woman his whole life, "only Cat", then shoves Lysa out the moon door. 

Epic. Nothing we didn't already know, but epic nonetheless.
					
					
							Edited by ~No One~, 07 May 2014 - 10:46 AM.
2499	Andurz	2014-05-07	As a long time book reader I`m a little embarrassed to admit that I`d honestly forgotten that LF was behind John Aryn`s death, and as such was just as shocked as my unsullied SO when watching this scene. Â I`d thought they`d pulled another potential future book spoiler on us like last week, but obviously after a quick refresher this was obviously not the case. Â Â 
Â 
My point though is that I was still stoked to see the "Only Cat" scene in the show, and had been exited to see how it would playout in the show ever since we realized we were getting a floor based moon door, even without the John Aryn reveal. Â The scene just has enough impact and shock value that it works without it, and can fully understand why the show runners would split it up as a way of more evenly distributing important plot details. Â
2500	Fantasy Character	2014-05-08	I remember reading the "Only Cat." chapter waaay back when and having the double whammy of "Wait, WHAT?!" followed shortly by "OH MY GOD".
Â 
Show-only viewers will have a different and longer reveal pattern, but without being both, I can't judge which one's the better experience. I hope it's a good one for them, though!
2501	salmonsnake	2014-05-08	I don't know about the shock and impact, all my Unsullied friends are already pretty confident someone's being thrown down that hole, it's a Chekhov's gun. It'll be one of the less surprising deaths this season, I imagine. I'm sure Kate Dickie will deliver the intensity and the suspense to make that scene compelling, however.
2502	TheReal_Rebel	2014-05-08	I'm betting that "only Cat' and Lady Stoneheart reveal happen in same episode and the LS scene will be the last shot to end S4 as it is in the books.
2503	Talking Hodor	2014-05-08	Â 
I think SW is a bit older here than in books. He probably knows how to keep a secret.


He still strikes me as an erratic nutjob whom nobody in their right mind should trust with a secret.Â  One minute he's all happy with his nice glass falcon gift, the next minute he chucks it like a 12-month-old trying to figure out how gravity works out the Moon Door.Â  That was the only mistake I saw in the whole scene (letting him know who Sansa is).Â  They hopefully have a good reason for it.

This would be dramatic.Â  For all the naysayers who wish Lady Stoneheart would make an appearance - she didn't exactly make too many appearances (and then mostly at the end) in the books so far.
2505	AryaSansa	2014-05-08	It was terrible because it means Jon's investigation of Lannister incest was a coincidence, and not the motive for his death!

He's like a retarded version of Joffrey, in a way: his is a casual cruelty, rooted in total self-involvement, which he would have grown out of but for his insane mother; whereas Joffrey's was sharpened to a point and quite deliberately performed. But both of them have an underlying sadistic streak, which one might argue comes from the same source: their overindulgent mothers. Both are raised from birth to believe their shit don't stink, and both have their cruel streaks excused and their every whim indulged. They're like medieval Cartmans.
Â 
And I don't think the similarity is coincidental, in book or in show: clearly Mr. Martin has his opinions on boys who are mollycoddled by their mothers. For poor Sansa, it's a cruel irony that she exchanges the tyranny of a mummy's boy for... the tyranny of another mummy's boy. The show underlines this point when Robyn throws her gift out of the Moon Door, much as Joffrey cut Tyrion's books into pieces: both boys are extremely ungrateful for the gift's they've received, and the only difference is that Joffrey intends something with his actions, whereas it just doesn't occur to Robyn to give a fuck. Deliberate cruelty vs. casual cruelty: I wonder which one's worse? I suppose that's quite a big theme in the story now that I think about it... but I'm going on too much.
Â 
As for Robyn not being able to keep a secret, we have to assume that eventually her identity will be revealed anyway, so perhaps it won't make that much of a difference. Or maybe Littlefinger's going to throw that little bastard out the window and all! Alright, so it might fuck up the story, but a man can dream.
Â 


It was terrible because it means Jon's investigation of Lannister incest was a coincidence, and not the motive for his death!


Â 
I disagree: although I may have read it wrong, my understanding is that Lysa poisoned Jon just enough to make him sick; Littlefinger did this in the knowledge that Pycelle, a Lannister agent, would make sure that Jon never recovered from that sickness, under orders from Cersei.
Â 
Even if that's not the case though, Jon's investigation was still important: doubtless Littlefinger knew about it, and thus used Jon's death, mid-investigation, to cast suspicion on the Lannisters and drive a wedge between them and the Starks. This would have left the King torn between his hated wife and his oldest friend, and potentially involved the North in any ensuing succession crisis. Any way those particular dice rolled, it would have resulted in chaos, which was Littlefinger's preferred outcome. Jon's investigation therefore was definitely the proximate cause of his death.
Â 
I wouldn't be surprised to find out that Littlefinger was the one who first gave Jon his suspicions. Joffrey was maybe 12 in the books and 16 in the show when Jon started investigating: what made him suddenly suspect that the boy wasn't a Baratheon? What... or who...

On the contrary, Robin is sincerely grateful for the gift; you can see it in how he reacts.Â  He's odd, not cruel.
2508	chrisdaw	2014-05-08	It was very clunky and forced, and LF doing the shifty voice and cartoon faces all through the scene made it all seem like a bad joke. Why they couldn't have slipped it in with the crazy Lysa and Sansa scene which was well written and acted I don't know.
2509	Colonel Green	2014-05-08	Why they couldn't have slipped it in with the crazy Lysa and Sansa scene which was well written and acted I don't know.


Because it's too early for Sansa to know that.

Why? The timing of Sansa's realisation and reaction is so critical that they couldn't possibly jeopardise it?
2511	Colonel Green	2014-05-08	Why? The timing of Sansa's realisation and reaction is so critical that they couldn't possibly jeopardise it?


Yeah, for a number of reasons.Â  Chief among them that its occurring in the chaotic moments where Lysa dies is kind of important for why Littlefinger is able to convince her that Lysa was just going nuts.Â  It would also completely change her attitude at the Eyrie in the leadup to the finale, when she isn't supposed to know that there's anything especially off about her aunt or Littlefinger (they've changed the former slightly by making her jealousy obvious, but that's not remotely the same thing as her knowing they conspired to murder Jon Arryn and start a war leading to the deaths of Sansa's family).
2512	chrisdaw	2014-05-08	Yeah I don't believe those are anywhere near important enough, or that the show is even capable of a deft enough touch that any of it would matter.
2513	StrollofShame	2014-05-08	I personally would absolutely love it if 'Only Cat' was delayed untill the last few minutes of episode 10, allowing Lysa's jealousy to get creepier and creepier throughout the season, finally culminating in the pivotal moment, and then immediately followed next scene by the Lady Stoneheart reveal!

I think my heart would stop. This would be amazing!
2514	StrollofShame	2014-05-08	Slightly off-topic about the reveal, but completely on-topic about Sansa & the Eerie...I have a pet theory that the title of Episode Ten refers not only to the Children of the Forest, but to the Stark children as well. Each has a thrilling & life-altering finale in ASOS, which is why I think Lysa's flight will be in the last ep. Bran meets BR & the little people; Arya heads to Braavos & FM; Sansa loses Auntie shockingly; & even bastard child Jon succeeds as LC. (No Rickon ending, tho). All of which culminates in LS's appearance. The Starks are baaaack!

Â 
That's a great theory! Let's hope it comes true. Also, let's not forget Dany's children (who will most likely end up in chains in ep. 4.10) and the Lannister's (the two brothers who reveal each other's secrets and what happens to their father).
2516	Joseph Nobles	2014-05-09	Perhaps Lysa will let something slip while tearing into Sansa after the snow castle, and Sansa will put it all together - meaning she's beginning her arc toward queen instead of pawn. So instead of Lysa redoing a villain speech, it's Sansa saying what happened, or saying enough for us to know she's got it.

Off topic, I know, but there's a great thread somewhere about the thematic similarities of Lysa and Cersei, parts of which include their children and how they raised them. I will search briefly for it, so you can have a look. Nothing accidental from GRRM about that, at all!
ETA: couldn't find it, sorry.
On topic: I've said it before (thrice, so far in this thread?) but I think Lysa will do a cray-cray ranting reveal of killing Jon in the moon door scene (for Sansa's benefit, and ours).

I'd love it if they ended the episodeÂ with Arya's scene at the temple with the Kindly ManÂ
2519	holycray	2014-05-10	I think they really need to do a "what happened on the last episode" before each episode. It would have been good to remind viewers of the scene where Catelyn receives the letter about Jon Arryn's death, its been 4 years since season 1 and people that don't re-watch shows may have forgotten.


Â

Â don't think so, my wife got it, she said wasn't her husband the guy with the stone eyes lying in state and I answered yes, she said if Sansa finds out she's gonna be pissied I smiled and said lets hope so.
Â
2522	edgeroc	2014-05-10	I liked the reveal as well. Honestly though, it kind of changed my opinion of the Lannisters a bit. For the last three seasons I had it in my mind (as did any unsullied I assume) that the Lannisters were responsible for Jon Aryn's death. Now don't get me wrong, I still hate Cercei, I think she is just a stain on the realm but after knowing now Jamie had nothing to do with it I find myself even liking him more after the reveal. Isn't that really what it's all about? Hating a character in the beginning like Jamie and the Hound but liking them immensely now is the real meat of this show in my opinion.Â 
Â 
I got caught up with a little bit of skimming and found out a bit too much of the moon door so now I have to leave this section for a while. It's hilarious that I walk on this site like I walk on eggshells but still find myself coming back here time and time again.

Â 
If Sansa's knowledge of the truth of the Arryn poisoning is important in and of itself - rather than her just being the vehicle for the audience discovering that knowledge - then that points the way towards her somehow taking advantage of that knowledge in the future... Does that make sense? I'm saying, in the books, Sansa finds out because we, the reader, have to find out, and she's the only POV in the Vale - but it doesn't mean that she'll do anything with that knowledge. On the show though, they're not sticking to the POVs, so they can give us that knowledge whenever - which they just did. So if they make a big deal out of Sansa specifically being the one to hear that knowledge, that signals to me that her knowing that knowledge will have some kind of importance/prominence within the story.
Â 
Sorry for my appalling writing but hopefully you get the gist


Â 
This is why I really don't like the early reveal: if they repeat the information again, then it makes very clear to both book and show viewers that Sansa's knowledge of Lysa & Petyr role in the death of Jon Arryn and the subsequent letter to Cersei, is important in itself (presumably Sansa will use it take down Littlefinger).
And if the show does not repeat the Jon Arryn reveal (which I think is likely) then it makes clear that the reason the information (about Jon Arryn & Lysa's letter to Catelyn) was given to book Sansa was merely to inform the readers and that Sansa is just a POV character with no actual arc, and that show Sansa will most likely remain in ignorance until she is rescued. Which bodes ill for book Sansa.

Or atleast show her researching, for instance, before I began writing original fiction Â I researched medieval herbs, with particular interest in anaphrodisiacs,I Â came across the works of Theophrastus (which contains some of the early descriptions/profiling of sociopathy), I also researched medieval cryptography and a little bit of steganography (coming across the fascinating Ave-Maria cipher)... seriously a few scenes where Sansa researches something... or seeks deliberately to gain information of Pedofinger... Given the show has 3 Sansa chapters to work with next season, showing a little bit of initiative and research on her part would be so much better than gratuitous nudity in some random brothel. But given that book Sansa doesn't do this... I have no hope for Show Sansa...
Â 
Well it's just silly, the idea that a mother's love somehow make her children weak, that indeed love can be excessive. Because if there's one thing this species has too much of, it's love.

If they don't repeat the reveal it may also be that they'd rather have Sansa come by that information some other way in the future, closer to when she might do something with it, which is more in line with the show's narrative style (even in the books, I think GRRM's handling of that is a bit awkward, reflecting the decision to abandon the five-year gap; we were supposed to jump five years ahead and meet the highly Stockholm'd "Alayne", whereas AFFC ends up picking up right after and the revelation is dismissed in like one sentence).

It's been a long time since I read it, but I don't recall feeling like Sansa's knowledge of Littlefinger's crimes was dismissed. I got the feeling she was just saving it for a rainy day. She probably knows enough by now to know that (a) she can't just blurt out a dangerous truth without being punished, and (  the enemy of her enemy is not necessarily her friend, so she needs to be very careful in how she uses that information.
Â 
But use it she will (I hope)

2533	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-04	Being Petyr's "niece" instead of his "daughter" adds a bit of a different dynamic (a less creepy one, for sure), but I don't think it's such a terrible change, so we'll see
Â 
Also, when Petyr is giving her the whole "Bloody Gate 101" thing I thought this is A ) foreshadowing for when the Lords Declarant besiege the Eyrie or B ) information that Sansa will use much later when (if the Gods are kind!) she takes some kind of control of the Eyrie
Â 
What else?...Oh, yeah. Sweetrobin's affection for LF. I don't know, it adds another layer of deviousness to his character, but I always thought it was funny how LF was basically disgusted by Robin and how Robin basically gave zero shits about LF in the books
Â 
Overall, Sophie's acting was very strong
2534	LizBe	2014-05-04	I'm just kind of annoyed at her being his niece because who's daughter would she be in the first place? I don't know, being a bastard from some random woman is such an easier identity to play out, there was no need to change this...
2535	Newstar	2014-05-04	So many questions! (Mostly variants of "What the hell?")
Â 
1. No dark hair or even differently-coloured hair for Alayne, when a point is made of how distinctive Sansa's red hair is as a mark of her identity?
2. Alayne is Petyr's niece and not her daughter?
3. TV Petyr has siblings or at least thinks he can lie convincingly about having siblings?
4. Is TV Alayne a bastard or still legitimate?
5. Why is TV Sweetrobin fond of Littlefinger when Book Sweetrobin is not?
6. Why is Sansa still wearing her wedding ring?
7. Why did TV Lysa let Sweetrobin in on Sansa's identity?
Â 
I will say that Sophie Turner's acting was aces in this episode.

Â 
I enjoyed Sansa's bits a lot. Im ok with the Jon Arryn reveal this early too. Putting it in a quieter scene (so to speak) lets the audience digest the reveal a lot easier. (Even dad when "uhhmm...")Â 
Sansa does seem to be much more aware of her surroundings, but also is letting her guard drop a little because Lysa is family. Sansa's rude awakening at Lysa's craziness was interesting. It also lets the audience know what Littlefinger has planned cuz Lysa is not wrong to suggest what she suggested. Shes just wrong in that Sansa has any idea that its a thing. Now Sansa knows....
Â 
Sansa knows...
Â 
That will be a theme this season. Sansa is continuing to absorb information. Lysa's plan to have Sansa marry Sweetrobin and Sansa's reaction to that is really cool. Sansa quiets down and looks both shocked and almost intrigued. Theres also some realization in her face. (Thanks Sophie Turner for being able to act.) Like "Omg this song and dance again?"Â 
Â 
As for Alayne being LF's niece, im ok with it. Being his bastard daughter wouldnt make too much sense. Random family member is a little easier.Â
2537	JonDunn	2014-05-04	The hair color thing is probably something we just have to accept. Â They'll have her wear her hood in public instead.
Â 
Probably not feasible to dye her hair, or maybe Sophie didn't want to. Â Maybe they tried a wig and it looked horribleÂ
2538	Colonel Green	2014-05-04	The title should really be "the birth of Alayne (Stone?)".
Â 
Honestly, would it have killed the writers to actually spend thirty seconds explaining this cover?Â  Is Petyr's niece still a bastard, or she supposed to be trueborn?Â  What's the point of changing their supposed relation?Â  Also, why call attention to the distinctiveness of the Tully red hair when Sansa is keeping it?Â  Why is she still wearing the same clothes she had in King's Landing when she left without packing anything?
Â 
That irritant aside, I generally liked her scenes this week.Â  Her interaction with Lysa was nice, though they're telegraphing Lysa's jealousy pretty hard here (though taking the surprise out of things is pretty common for this show).Â  The dialogue on this show can often be terribly unsubtle, so I liked the unexpected linkage between Catelyn supposedly liking sweets and Lysa's later rant.
Â 
I wonder if Robin being aware of who Sansa is is meant to give her somebody other than Littlefinger to talk to next season.

On the contrary, there'd be a far higher degree of scrutiny attached to a legitimate relation (if that's what Alayne is supposed to be) than to a bastard.Â  Noble lineages are exhaustively catalogued in a society like Westeros (and even today, hence things like Burke's Peerage), even minor nobles like the Baelishs.

2539	Newstar	2014-05-04	Why is she still wearing the same clothes she had in King's Landing when she left without packing anything?
Â 
Good point! Man, I forgot about that. How could she possibly have the Blackwater dress when she only left KL with the clothes on her back, being the purple PW dress?
2540	Colonel Green	2014-05-05	In a weird bit, Lino Facioli's IMDb entry had him credited for episodes 7 and 10 for months now, which we all assumed was a management thing, but he turned out to be in this episode too, and that wasn't put up.Â  Very weird.

Â 
Book Sansa, when asked about being made to marry Tyrion:Â  "They made me marry him. I never wanted it."
Â 
TV Sansa, when asked pretty much the same question: "They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to."
Â 
Apart from the obvious differences, the interesting thing is that in the book version of the line, the "they" in "They made me marry him" clearly seems to include Tyrion, whereas in the show version of the line, the "they" seems to refer to the Lannisters other than Tyrion, since "they" made "both" Tyrion and Sansa marry each other.
Â 
...Not surprised the Lysa/Sansa dialogue about Tyrion having whores and so on was changed for the show, what with Book Tyrion's line on their wedding night being changed to "And now my watch begins," though.
Â 
I will say one thing that bugged me: Sansa licking her fingers after eating in the Lysa/Sansa scene. I can sort of buy it, that Sansa's "letting her hair down" by relaxing her manners around Lysa now that she believes she's with a family member she can trust, but I have trouble believing that Sansa, who of anyone would have had proper etiquette drilled into her, would ever be that ill-mannered, even in a relaxed, unguarded moment. Even in our Middle Ages, where table manners were quite a different animal, licking one's fingers was still frowned upon.

The implications of Robin's liking of Petyr are possibly important.

Â 
The big problem with the wedding ring is that I can't think of any other female married character in Westeros who wears one (and forget about the men): Talisa doesn't wear one, Margaery doesn't wear one, and even Lysa isn't wearing a wedding ring after wedding Petyr this episode (she's wearing the same flashy ring on her ring finger both before and after marrying Petyr). I didn't even think that Sansa's ring was a wedding ring at first for that reason, but if you look at Sansa's hands in 3x08, she's not wearing a ring before the wedding ceremony, and at the first shot of her at the wedding feast, there's a ring on her finger, so I guess that's what we're supposed to think.
Â 
The ring didn't bother me too, too much at first, since I was expecting that Sansa would rip the ring off and fling it into the sea while on Petyr's ship as a symbolic demonstration of her liberation from the oppressive Lannister yoke, and that the point of the ring was to mark her transformation from Lannister pawn to Alayne Stone. Not only did that not happen, but she's still wearing it, even though she's already started to masquerade as Alayne. She's even wearing it in bed in the scene where she's trying to ignore Lysa's screams, even though there was a shot of her night table (or whatever the medieval equivalent is) where she could have placed the ring (like most people do with their rings at night). I guess the "rip the ring off and throw it away" scene could be upcoming, or the ring could just disappear discreetly before Sansa's next episode, but I still don't know why the writers bothered with the ring in the first place, unless they think that the audience is going to forget that Sansa was married without a visual reminder.

2551	Dragon of Valyria	2014-05-05	The niece change seems really strange and pointless. Why did they change it? It introduces more complications than it solves, unless they want us to believe LF is the sort of man who couldn't convincingly have a bastard.
Â 
Â 
It was good that Sansa got some considerable screen-time this episode, but most of her scenes were strange. I could buy the scene with Lysa and the desserts, and the noisy sleeping scene was vaguely comical. The Bloody Gate discussion was kind of silly, and it made the Eyrie look like it wasn't very high at all -- certainly not anywhere near the top of Giant's Lance.Â

Â 
Great point -- that bothered me too! It's just lazy -- shows a bit of a lack of attention. It quite reminds me of that scene where they had Sansa belittle Septa Mordane for no apparent reason. They seem to want to portray her as a modern spoiled teenager for the sake of audience identification, instead of someone for whom "courtesy is a lady's armor" was almost a mantra.

Worth noting that Lysa's Jon Arryn reveal was told to Petyr privately, this along with Sansa's defence of Tyrion, could mean they are setting up Sansa to be remain ignorant and a victim of Littlefinger, so that she can be rescued by Saint Tyrion later down the track.

It is a little over the top this season, though, especially when it comes to Tyrion and Sansa. In five episodes we've had the following:
Â 
4x01: Tyrion tries to comfort Sansa, tells Oberyn that he's sworn off whores now that he's married, refuses to go to bed with Shae (whereas Book Tyrion had no compunction when it came to bedding Shae and did nothing to comfort Sansa because he thought she wouldn't want comfort from a Lannister)
4x02: Tyrion/Sansa talking at the wedding ("We have a new queen"), Tyrion holds Sansa's hand, Sansa hands Tyrion the cup to help salvage his dignity (whereas Book Sansa is distant and unmoved by Tyrion's humiliation and Tyrion is self-pitying and bitter)
4x03: Tyrion takes the news that Sansa's gone surprisingly well, insists Sansa's not a killer (whereas Book Tyrion thought Sansa could have done it, if not alone).
4x04: Tyrion again insists that Sansa's no killer (...yet), Sansa immediately denies that Tyrion was responsible for Joffrey's murder with no logical basis except "just knowing" (whereas Book Tyrion and Book Sansa each believed the other capable of the murder)
4x05: Sansa earnestly insists that Tyrion didn't want to marry her and that he was made to marry her by the Lannisters just as she was made to marry him (whereas Book Sansa stated in response to the same question that she was made to marry him by "them," meaning the Lannisters including Tyrion, and she never wanted it)
Â 
In isolation, each change from ASOS is not really anything to write home about, but when piled on top of each other, my God.

I actually do think they may be planning not to include Lysa's babbling about the murder during the Moon Door scene, if they feel they can't adequately explain why that revelation doesn't produce any visible changes in Sansa's behavior toward Littlefinger.Â  In the books GRRM was originally going to jump five years into the future and presumably return to a Stockholm'd Sansa, which had to be changed, resulting in the revelation being dismissed in a single paragraph for the time being.

Â 
edit: And on that note, what's with the discussion of the lack of lemons? What, the flippin' Vale of Arryn doesn't have lemons?? Absurd. There isn't even the siege of the Lords Declarant or the closing of the passes yet. Of course the Vale can supply lemons to the Eyrie, they don't need LF to run special deliveries.

I certainly hope so too. Not a big fan of the Sandor-Sansa relationship but give me that over more of Saint Tyrion.

I'm not really saying Littlefinger will have a bigger personal relationship with Robin. More so that his fear and hatred of Petyr is crucial to the way he acts, and thus, his interactions with Sansa.

Yeah I honestly just noticed it tonight. Seems very out of place imo. Especially considering Sansa is supposed to be in hiding. But then again, Show Littlefinger is a well established dumbass who spouts his plans both in public and to one of his greatest rivals.
Â 
I agreeÂ it would have been an excellent touch for Sansa to have thrown her ring into the sea after Dontos' death. But given the treatment of Tyrion, Sansa will likely keep it as a memento of her kind and selfless husband. No doubt she will look upon it before she marries Harrold Hardying with nostalgia for all the warm moments she spent not getting raped by her husband.

Â 
It would be one thing if it were a subtle, tasteful band or something, but because it's a Lannister ring the props people sensibly made it a flashy, tacky monstrosity that's impossible not to notice, and because the ring represents an ongoing insult both to the book continuity--where wedding rings do not exist--and to show continuity, where no other female married character wears a wedding ring, the garish design is just adding insult to injury.
Â 
Long story short, the ring really bothers me. I've even more annoyed about the ring than I am about Alayne being LF's niece and not changing her hair. It's like Sansa licking her fingers or Sansa somehow wearing her Blackwater dress instead of her PW dress in this episode: it's always the little things.
Â 
so that she can use Lannister gold
Â 
As we learned this episode, what Lannister gold? Womp womp!

He certainly seemed pretty hale and hearty for a supposedly sickly child.
2569	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-05	Being Petyr's "niece" instead of his "daughter" adds a bit of a different dynamic (a less creepy one, for sure), but I don't think it's such a terrible change, so we'll see
Â 
Also, when Petyr is giving her the whole "Bloody Gate 101" thing I thought this is A ) foreshadowing for when the Lords Declarant besiege the Eyrie or B ) information that Sansa will use much later when (if the Gods are kind!) she takes some kind of control of the Eyrie
Â 
What else?...Oh, yeah. Sweetrobin's affection for LF. I don't know, it adds another layer of deviousness to his character, but I always thought it was funny how LF was basically disgusted by Robin and how Robin basically gave zero shits about LF in the books
Â 
Overall, Sophie's acting was very strong


Â 
Â 
1) I am a bit peeved that they chose "niece" instead of "daughter". It does change the dynamic, and not for the better. Not so much for what other people would know, but what they might expect from Alayne later on.
Â 
2) I like that Sweetrobin is pals with Petyr for the moment, but also that he threw Petyr's gift right out the Moon Door. Perfect.Â

I hope that they are not going to alter the Moon Door scene in that way. That's much of what made it such a shocker - perhaps they've revealed too much of Lysa's craziness.Â

2571	queensansa	2014-05-05	The hair color thing is probably something we just have to accept. Â They'll have her wear her hood in public instead.
Â 
Probably not feasible to dye her hair, or maybe Sophie didn't want to. Â Maybe they tried a wig and it looked horribleÂ 


Â 
I saw Sophie Turner's hair being dyed in one of the behind-the-scenes videos (possibly A Foreshadowing, although I can't guarantee) so I guess they'll have her hair dyed during her next appearance.
Â 
Â 


Funny thing is that Lysa told her she mustn't call her "aunt Lysa" before anybody else, but with Alayne being LFs niece Lysa is actually her aunt by marriage.

Â 
Yeah, funny how that worked out. The only way they can get around that is if Alayne is in fact a bastard niece, and therefore wouldn't refer to Lysa as 'Aunt' anyway.Â 
Â 
I doubt they'd make Alayne legitimate, since Sansa's dislike of bastards is somewhat prominent to her character. 'Alayne Stone' has a ring to it also.
2572	Newstar	2014-05-05	I doubt they'd make Alayne legitimate, since Sansa's dislike of bastards is somewhat prominent to her character.
Â 
Her book character, maybe (although I wouldn't say that Book Sansa dislikes bastards, merely that she's conscious of social class differences). Her TV character has no strong feelings about bastards one way or the other, and her TV character seems less mindful of class distinctions given how quickly she befriended and how attached she was to her handmaiden, knowing that she had a sketchy background (although Book Sansa did befriend Ser Dontos despite his drop in status to that of a fool, and I suppose Book Sansa might have befriended one of her handmaidens if she felt she could trust any of them).

2573	jons nissa	2014-05-05	making sansa littlefinger's niece must be what aiden meant by avuncular Â  
Â 
interesting developments. i do think that revealing jon arryn is not a huge problem but ti was very dramatic as it played out in the books. is the show planning something to replace all that?
Â 
i don't know if we're meant to notice the ring as much as some have. it hasn't been mentioned in any of the episode discussions, has it? what's more, i don't see it being ripped off by sansa any time soon but perhaps lysa might rip it off.
Â 
i wonder when we'll have the snow scene? probably 2 or 3 episodes later ending with lysa looking in? dun dun duuuuun.
Â 
the look sansa gives after lysa mentions the betrothal didn't look like intrigue to me but more what??!!!!!!Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
Man, don't even joke about that shizz.
Â 
Â 
A+ use of "hagiography."
Â 
It is a little over the top this season, though, especially when it comes to Tyrion and Sansa. In five episodes we've had the following:
Â 
4x01: Tyrion tries to comfort Sansa, tells Oberyn that he's sworn off whores now that he's married, refuses to go to bed with Shae (whereas Book Tyrion had no compunction when it came to bedding Shae and did nothing to comfort Sansa because he thought she wouldn't want comfort from a Lannister)
4x02: Tyrion/Sansa talking at the wedding ("We have a new queen"), Tyrion holds Sansa's hand, Sansa hands Tyrion the cup to help salvage his dignity (whereas Book Sansa is distant and unmoved by Tyrion's humiliation and Tyrion is self-pitying and bitter)
4x03: Tyrion takes the news that Sansa's gone surprisingly well, insists Sansa's not a killer (whereas Book Tyrion thought Sansa could have done it, if not alone).
4x04: Tyrion again insists that Sansa's no killer (...yet), Sansa immediately denies that Tyrion was responsible for Joffrey's murder with no logical basis except "just knowing" (whereas Book Tyrion and Book Sansa each believed the other capable of the murder)
4x05: Sansa earnestly insists that Tyrion didn't want to marry her and that he was made to marry her by the Lannisters just as she was made to marry him (whereas Book Sansa stated in response to the same question that she was made to marry him by "them," meaning the Lannisters including Tyrion, and she never wanted it)
Â 
In isolation, each change from ASOS is not really anything to write home about, but when piled on top of each other, my God.


Â 
i mentioned this in last week's thread, the list above coupled with the fact that the whole marriage started off on a very different note is painting a very different picture in the minds of the unsullied viewer, however some book readers seem to be having a really hard time with that reality.

Probably because it is now the exact opposite of what it was in the book. You are used to characters and seeing these 180 changes are jarring. I haven't seen the episode yet, but I do fear VoodooQueen is correct in her assessment. 
However I am still hoping that it is just the writers messing up as they have so far altered various characters in ways that are beginning not to make sense: Jaime for example. They certainly like to make Sansa seem stupid, which in the books she is not.

Â 
yes, it is very different from the books. i've said that several times along with everyone else.Â 
Â 
however, i don't believe she seemed stupid. in fact, she was much bolder and aggressive with littlefinger in last week's episode than she ever was in the books.Â

No, you said that the Unsullied think that the marriage wasn't forced, which is definitely not the reality for the majority of viewers or for the way it is shown in the show, and if some Unsullied actually think that Sansa wanted to marry Tyrion or had any choice in the matter, then, as I said, they are just not very smart.
Heck, even in this episode they had Sansa reiterate that it was a forced marriage just in case someone forgot/was too dumb to get it. The difference from the book is that they're doing everything to make Tyrion look as a total good guy, including making him much nicer to her and making it look as if he has no more choice in the matter than she did - and consequently making their relations friendlier... but it's still a marriage Sansa was forced to, even if they made her wedding night far less traumatic. 
Anyway, there is certainly a big difference in the level of friendliness in their relationship, but 180 degrees it's not... they would have to hate each other in the book, or to be passionately in love in the show for that to be the case, so it's more like...45 degrees? 60? 75?
2578	The hairy bear	2014-05-05	In a weird bit, Lino Facioli's IMDb entry had him credited for episodes 7 and 10 for months now, which we all assumed was a management thing, but he turned out to be in this episode too, and that wasn't put up.Â  Very weird.

I don't recall show!Sansa ever showin any kind of "dislike" towards bastards. Having her be a Stone wouldn't mean much within the context of the show.

My guess is that they'll just never give a surname for Alayne, and her status won't be addressed at all.

She did show dislike for a commoner (Mycah) and Arya socializing with him in AGOT, but I think she ever said anything about bastards, other than always calling Jon their bastard half brother.

2582	Chebyshov	2014-05-05	These "St. Tyrion" posts are annoying me. They're clearly setting him up for a giant fall. If they end up not having him kill Shae like he does in the books, then I'll certainly join everyone else in admonishing the show-runners. But my god, it's getting tiresome to read.
Â 
As for how it pertains to Sansa, Tyrion didn't want the marriage either and Sansa knew that. And that's straight from the books.
Â 
Â 

He waddled closer. â<U+0080><U+009C>You did not ask for this marriage, I know. No more than I did. If I had refused you, however, they would have wed you to my cousin Lancel. Perhaps you would prefer that. He is nearer your age, and fairer to look upon.Â If that is your wish, say so, and I will end this farce.

Her reiterating that to Lysa doesn't bother me.

2588	juanml82	2014-05-05	Regarding the ring. It's a neon light with "married girl here!" written on it. But in-story, it's not a marriage ring - such a thing doesn't exist in Westeros. We don't even know if the character links it to Tyrion

Â 
I've never been a fan of that forum in general, so no. But you haven't answered my question.
Â 


Â 
I am not joking. Whilst I ultimately think Tyrion and Sansa are ultimately the end game, in the books, this will be portrayed as a tragedy: a beautiful girl must prostitute herself to a depraved, rapist with Greyscale/VD (book Tyrion without euphemisms), so that she can use Lannister gold to rebuild Winterfell, thus sacrificing her happiness for the good of Rickon and the Starks... to the show's "Look at the stupid, spoiled teenage girl who is rude to her Septa and licks her fingers, lucky she got rescued from Obviously!EVIL!Littlefinger by St Tyrion, whom she loves because he is so nice and funny, even though the Gold Mines under Casterly Rock are empty" Thus erasing the very scary female gaze for the benefit of male viewers, and teaching female viewers the lesson that they should love a man who is short, has scoliosis and Â arms too short to wipe his own backside and has a 50% chance of passing on those undesirable traits to their children, whilst being beautiful and thin, because fat women are just the worst.


Â 
So, I gather, you don't like Tyrion? 
Â 
I could list lots of Sansa-related reasons why I find this endgame unlikely - such as why I don't think that Sansa's arc so far points or hints to an outcome in which she end up prostituting/sacrificing herself for Winterfell; or that, even if she were to end that way, there are lots of other people she could prostitute herself to for much better political gains compared to what marrying a Lannister could get her; but what particularly strikes me about your doom scenario is that it is contingent on Tyrion ultimately playing the role of a immoral villain/twisted monster/sexually deviant demon monkey, much like the Richard III-like version of him from Phario Forel's play, or the popular image of him among people of Westeros. Now, book!Tyrion is not Saint Tyrion of the show, he's a very flawed man, but he's definitely not Twisted Demon Monkey Tyrion, even though this version seems popular among a portion of book fans on this forum. (As with Dany, who must be Evil Mad Queen if she's not the Perfect Messiah of Goodness, characters apparently must be black of white.) GRRM is subverting the "twisted monster" trope with Tyrion (and with other characters) - even when Tyrion, as a part of his descent into darkness in ADWD, starts thinking of himself and behaving similarly to what people always thought he was, I'm pretty sure we're not supposed to think "they were right, he is and was always an evil monster". And, well, I also don't think that an ending based on making the readers ponder "look at how awful, disgusting and vomit-inducing those men with dwarfism are" would be any more... enlightened than your sarcastic scenario about beautiful girls having to prostitute themselves and fat women being the worst.
Â 
Really, we've been there with Sansa and Tyrion, (not) done that, seen that scenario subverted in multiple ways; I don't see it being repeated and played straight the second time, in either one of those ways (Twisted Demon Monkey raping and abusing the beautiful tragic maiden, or spoiled girl Seeing the Light and realizing that her forced marriage was what she always needed because her husband is just so awesome and girls don't know what's good for them in the first place).
Â 
I will concede though that I don't think it's out of the question that Sansa and Tyrion may, due to circumstances, always remain married... officially. I just don't think they'll ever going to have sex or actually live like husband and wife. The ring may always stay there, but there'll be no bloody cloak, so to speak.Â  I wouldn't be too surprised if, just like in the game we love to play in the Games forum, the people Sansa gets to fuck, marry and kill are all separate from each other.

Â 
1. (Definitely) Because they really, really want the audience to think that Tyrion is a total Good Guy and really, really didn't force that 14-year old girl to marry him, so what better way to do that than have her reiterate once more that he's a a total good guy?
Â 
2. (Definitely) Because they try to minimize all conflict between the "good guys", and they want the audience to like Sansa now, and some portions of the audience would hate her just for disliking their favorite character, the cool and funny Tyrion (it happens with lots of book readers.. just look at all those "why was Sansa such a bitch to Tyrion" threads that pop up once in a while)
Â 
3. (Possibly) Because Sansa and Tyrion may end up having friendly relations (a political alliance, for instance) in the far future, and they think they need to set it up because the audience would otherwise think that they hate each other if we don't get their internal thoughts (and obviously, as far as the show goes, you are either BFFs or hate each other's guts... subtlety isn't the show's strong suit).

Subtle is definitely not their strong point, LOL.

People can have a discussion about things they don't like in the show and still not hate the show.
Â 
St Tyrion is a different character than the books, he is not a little nicer, he is totally different. it is a big deal because it is a big change.
Â 
If you don't like this thread then don't read it. If you don't like people talking about St Tyrion, then don't read it. Take your own advice about people watching the show and commenting on it, if you don't like, don't read.
2597	Newstar	2014-05-05	I think the problem with the Tyrion changes. Chuckling Tree, is that the changes to the Tyrion/Sansa dynamic are more akin to the changes to Cat than to the changes to Tyrion's character overall. The writers can still course-correct with Tyrion's personality overall, as I expect they will when Tyrion kills Tywin and Shae. With Tyrion and Sansa's dynamic, though, there's no fixing it in the sense of course-correcting it to be more in line with the books, any more than there's fixing Cat: the two have had the last interaction they'll have in the published books, or maybe ever. It is what it is.

2598	Mladen	2014-05-05	St. Tyrion of House Whitewashing is a real deal... You may not like it but it is true.
Â 
As for this Vale conundrum. I watched this episode and I don't know where to start with this, what to make out of this and how to interpret. Simply, there are too many details changed so we could talk about some parallels between show and books.Â 
Â 
1. Change from daughter to niece. This is, probably done, to evade the ick factor of the future kissing, seduction etc scenes. One has to wonder why would those scenes be ick when the viewers are very much familiar with who is Alayne. The ick factor would be about the age...
Â 
2. Discovery about Jon Arryn's death. Â I don't mind it being revealed a bit earlier. I do mind that Sansa wasn't there to hear it. For she acknowledged the fact that Lysa killed Jon. She doesn't realize what that event triggered.
Â 
3. SR knows who is Sansa. OK, this is by far, the most ludicrous idea show runners ever had. LF wouldn't trust SR information about where lemons are stored in the kitchen let alone Sansa's identity.
Â 
4. Cat was fat? That entire conversation was a bit off. Â It is not that I disliked it, it's just weird. I also liked how Sansa used the same mantra people assessed her and defended herself with it. "I am stupid little girl, silly little girl..."Â 
Â 
Now, in terms of the books, what does this show? Nothing, in my opinion. Trying to figure this out would be like pissing into the wind. There are like dozens different scenarios or possible foreshadowing clues that these changes suggests. I also noticed that dress, and the hair. I mean, I would really liked that Turner, for the sake of Alayne mask, left her hair as it is (it would be nice to see her as blonde in the show), but, it is what it is...
Â 
Also, that Game of moans was hilarious... I heard that one more time, on farm when I saw a cow giving birth...
Â 
As for IMDB and the entries, all the new cast members are listed for 10 episodes in the season they appear, and once those episodes air, they take them off the cast members lists.
2599	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	I think Lysa saying Cat used to be fat is just an allusion to the books where Lysa is fat.
2600	Hound's She-wolf	2014-05-05	4. Cat was fat? That entire conversation was a bit off. Â It is not that I disliked it, it's just weird. I also liked how Sansa used the same mantra people assessed her and defended herself with it. "I am stupid little girl, silly little girl..."Â

She may have been a chubby kid, but i took this as Lysa and her sour grapes, just saying any snide little nasty thing she could think of.
2601	Chebyshov	2014-05-05	I think Lysa saying Cat used to be fat is just an allusion to the books where Lysa is fat.


Â 
I think so too. Just like how at the RW they specifically mentioned how good the musicians were.

Â 
She's naturally blonde and dyes her hair red for the role, wouldn't that be why she was seen dyeing her hair?
Â 
Â 
I've never been a fan of that forum in general, so no. But you haven't answered my question.
Â 
Â 
So, I gather, you don't like Tyrion?Â  
Â 
I could list lots of Sansa-related reasons why I find this endgame unlikely - such as why I don't think that Sansa's arc so far points or hints to an outcome in which she end up prostituting/sacrificing herself for Winterfell; or that, even if she were to end that way, there are lots of other people she could prostitute herself to for much better political gains compared to what marrying a Lannister could get her; but what particularly strikes me about your doom scenario is that it is contingent on Tyrion ultimately playing the role of a immoral villain/twisted monster/sexually deviant demon monkey, much like the Richard III-like version of him from Phario Forel's play, or the popular image of him among people of Westeros. Now, book!Tyrion is not Saint Tyrion of the show, he's a very flawed man, but he's definitely not Twisted Demon Monkey Tyrion, even though this version seems popular among a portion of book fans on this forum. (As with Dany, who must be Evil Mad Queen if she's not the Perfect Messiah of Goodness, characters apparently must be black of white.) GRRM is subverting the "twisted monster" trope with Tyrion (and with other characters) - even when Tyrion, as a part of his descent into darkness in ADWD, starts thinking of himself and behaving similarly to what people always thought he was, I'm pretty sure we're not supposed to think "they were right, he is and was always an evil monster". And, well, I also don't think that an ending based on making the readers ponder "look at how awful, disgusting and vomit-inducing those men with dwarfism are" would be any more... enlightened than your sarcastic scenario about beautiful girls having to prostitute themselves and fat women being the worst.
Â 
Really, we've been there with Sansa and Tyrion, (not) done that, seen that scenario subverted in multiple ways; I don't see it being repeated and played straight the second time, in either one of those ways (Twisted Demon Monkey raping and abusing the beautiful tragic maiden, or spoiled girl Seeing the Light and realizing that her forced marriage was what she always needed because her husband is just so awesome and girls don't know what's good for them in the first place).
Â 
I will concede though that I don't think it's out of the question that Sansa and Tyrion may, due to circumstances, always remain married... officially. I just don't think they'll ever going to have sex or actually live like husband and wife. The ring may always stay there, but there'll be no bloody cloak, so to speak.Â  I wouldn't be too surprised if, just like in the game we love to play in the Games forum, the people Sansa gets to fuck, marry and kill are all separate from each other.Â  


I think that GRRM hinted in an interview that the death of Sansa's direwolf mean that she was no longer of the North/died as a Stark. So I don't think book Sansa will ever go North again.
Given that even in the best case scenario, the Starks will need to be rebuilding Winterfell after ADOS, they will certainly need Sansa to make a good/wealthy marriage (since Arya certainly won't be available). Since Harry the Heir and Willas Tyrell have yet to be seen on screen, it doesn't seem likely that Sansa will end up with either of those nonentities, whereas Tyrion has been around from book 1.
I Â think future books will show Sansa as haunted by grief over her betrayal of her father (as a result of her minuscule book 1 actions), and she will make the decide to stay with Tyrion as a form of repentance. So I don't think Tyrion will force her to remain married (he maybe a rapist, and a whore monger but he likes the fantasy of being desired) but she will offer, for reasons that are both rational and moral (i.e not motivated by twu wuv but motivated by self sacrifice in exchange for Lannister gold to rebuild Winterfell). Tyrion will thus finally believe that he has obtained his fantasy (possession of a beautiful woman who will love him for himself), only for it to be the the same relationship he had with Shae, but with a much higher price.Â 
Sex without desire is at the very least nauseating (as any woman who has tried it can attest), and desire is ultimately about the body. The judgements of the body are not enlightened ones.
Perhaps D&D just don't get that a woman can make unemotional but moral decisions, so they will have the completion of the Tyrion Sansa marriage be about Twu Wuv and "aren't I lucky to have such a nice and funny guy."
Â 
I once shared your optimism about Tyrion and Sansa, but the show made me realise that it wasn't end game (my suspicions were raised as far back as season 2 when they eliminated SanSan and Tyrion's comment along the lines of "You'll surprise us yet Lady Stark") but season 3 confirmed it.
the show's lack of subtly kind of made the ending of the book easier to predict.

2603	~No One~	2014-05-05	St. Tyrion of House Whitewashing is a real deal... You may not like it but it is true. snip 
Â 
3. SR knows who is Sansa. OK, this is by far, the most ludicrous idea show runners ever had. LF wouldn't trust SR information about where lemons are stored in the kitchen let alone Sansa's identity.

I agree with most of what you said, cheers.
I think the St. Tyrion will be having a very, very dramatic downfall next season. He's been built up so much as the good guy, especially by Sansa, that his plummet from the peak of Mount Can't-Do-Anything-Wrong will be epic.
As for SR knowing about Sansa, isn't it Lysa who mentions it? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I didn't think it was LF, who, I agree, wouldn't share that info.
2604	The hairy bear	2014-05-05	That's not true.Â  The actors' agents often upload information; Ser Dontos' appearances were, for instance.


Â 
Sometimes it's the actor's agents that upload information. Sometimes it's some stupid teenager who's bored at home. You have no way of knowing, so the information is not realiable.
Â 
If you try to submit information to Imdb, you'll see how easy it is.

The point being that Robin's appearances looked to have been from his agent, especially given that they predicted episode 7 well before its content was known.

Â 
Yeah, I mean it could be nasty thing to say, since we know that Cat was regarded as very beautiful by everyone who knew her.
Â 
Â 


I think that GRRM hinted in an interview that the death of Sansa's direwolf mean that she was no longer of the North/died as a Stark.Â 


Â 
As far as I know, he never said something like that. Especially given the fact that the author himself has been establishing connections between Sansa and the North time after time throughout the book series.
Â 
Â 


I think the St. Tyrion will be having a very, very dramatic downfall next season. He's been built up so much as the good guy, especially by Sansa, that his plummet from the peak of Mount Can't-Do-Anything-Wrong will be epic.


Â 
Yeah, I imagine that too... But, it is so frustrating that they added so much material to Tyrion to make him better. I mean the scene with Pod last episode was the limit for me...
Â

I know it was Lysa who told him, but if you think that Lysa would say that without LF's permission, than I think you are wrong. This was done with LF's blessing, which is why I find it idiotic.
Â 
As for whether it is harmless, it could be... But, I am not sure anymore...

That was just one of several slips from LF IMO, he didn't have Sansa color her hair, just pull up her hood after several archers already saw her, she still has that gaudy gold Lannister ring and now SR knows her true identity-either it doesn't ultimately mean anything and is harmless-(which I can't see, why include it if it doesn't matter) or it means that LF is getting sloppy and he has left clues for people who are coming to the Vale to find.
2608	Chebyshov	2014-05-05	That was just one of several slips from LF IMO, he didn't have Sansa color her hair, just pull up her hood after several archers already saw her, she still has that gaudy gold Lannister ring and now SR knows her true identity-either it doesn't ultimately mean anything and is harmless-(which I can't see, why include it if it doesn't matter) or it means that LF is getting sloppy and he has left clues for people who are coming to the Vale to find.


Â 
Exactly. And because of the medium of TV, I think the clues may need to be more obvious. Also because show viewers don't know about things like Yohn Royce previously interacting with Sansa.
Â 
I am mystified why they'd even mention her hair color if not to dye it later, but it looks like she's staying a redhead, so maybe that was another nod to book readers.
2609	queensansa	2014-05-05	Turner never changed her hair at any point during filming.

Â 
I found the clip. It's at 9:55 and 10:27 in A Foreshadowing - youtube.com/watch?v=J5iS3tULXMQ
Â 
It looks to me like they're dying her hair, from what I can tell... The dye is more than likely temporary. I'm sure LF mentioned her memorable shade in order to make the change in the next episode that they appear in.

Â 
Â 


Â 
Â 
I don't recall show!Sansa ever showin any kind of "dislike" towards bastards. Having her be a Stone wouldn't mean much within the context of the show.
Â 
My guess is that they'll just never give a surname for Alayne, and her status won't be addressed at all.


Â 
Maybe not dislike per se, but to some extent, skepticism and awareness.Â 
Book!Sansa wasn't all that happy about her new identity being that of a bastard, but of course, she differs from show!Sansa.
You're right, it doesn't really have to be addressed and can be left unmentioned, although I feel that transitioning from highborn to bastard is more notable than highborn to highborn (or half highborn, depending on the supposed circumstances of Alayne's birth). Nevertheless, it's not as relevant to her character in the show compared to the books.
2610	Colonel Green	2014-05-05	I'm sure LF mentioned her memorable shade in order to make the change in the next episode that they appear in.


We've seen images of both the Snow Castle and Moon Door scenes.Â  Her hair is red.
Â 
If Sophie was getting her hair coloured, most likely it was just touching up her existing dye job.Â  They wouldn't dye it to film scenes out-of-order and then change back to red immediately after.
2611	Cas Stark	2014-05-05	That will be odd if they don't have her dye her hair. Â A red head with a Northern accent shows up with LF from KL...and no one in the Vale is going to put it together? Â Unless they're going to change the story where it's an open secret who she is or add in some future events after she's identified....an odd choice. Â Do they think the TV viewers will forget who she is if they give her brown hair?
2612	Colonel Green	2014-05-05	A red head with a Northern accent shows up with LF


Accents are totally ignored in the books, but even in the show, Sansa doesn't have a "Northern" accent (which seems largely to be Scottish/Northern English).Â  She has a very posh city accent, akin to most of the southern nobles apart from Sam (who has a lower-class comedy sidekick accent).
2613	Annara Snow	2014-05-05	That will be odd if they don't have her dye her hair. Â A red head with a Northern accent shows up with LF from KL...and no one in the Vale is going to put it together?

Â Do they think the TV viewers will forget who she is if they give her brown hair?


Â 
Yes, I think that's exactly what they think. They're not known for overestimating the audience (think of Osha/Asha/Yara, Robert/Robin)... Maybe they're even right to an extent - in another thread, someone told the story of how their mother asked: "Didn't he die at the wedding last season?!" when she saw Jon.  And apparently, lot of people know Sansa as "ginger Stark"...
Â 
It's not a big deal, though - you can even say that there could be good Watsonian reasons to not do it; maybe she looks unconvincing as a brunette, she could run out of dye or someone could notice the roots, and a girl Sansa's age with dyed hair and red roots would be even more suspicious than just a girl with red hair.

Â 
Doesn't it stretch credulity that a red head...same coloring as Lysa Tully Arynn...is in the Vale...who showed up with LF from KL...shortly after Sansa Stark, the red head who looks like the Tullys disappears and is the niece of red head Lysa? Â Answer: Â yes.
Â 
They will just expect the audience to ignore it..even though LF already told her to put her hood on..to cover her red hair. Â
2615	Rapsie	2014-05-05	Anyway, there is certainly a big difference in the level of friendliness in their relationship, but 180 degrees it's not... they would have to hate each other in the book, or to be passionately in love in the show for that to be the case, so it's more like...45 degrees? 60? 75?


I would dispute that. 180 degree shift is about the opposite, it does not have to be an extreme. If a character in a book midly dislikes another character yet in the TV version mildly likes them, then they have done 180 degree shift.Â 
Â 
In the case of Sansa and Tyrion, their relationship has gone from one of icy politeness and no warmth to laughing and supportive after their forced marriage. Instead of Tyrion's bitter thoughts about Sansa during Joff's wedding, we have Sansa being snarky and Tyrion being kind etc. There have been very significant changes in the character interactions. Now whether that is down to the showrunners being hampered by 1. the St Tyrion monster they have created or 2. something to do with the way the books end, or 3. the other possibility that they are going to end the TV series differently to the books will be unknown for a long time to come, although my preference is option 1 and 3.
Â 


These "St. Tyrion" posts are annoying me. They're clearly setting him up for a giant fall. If they end up not having him kill Shae like he does in the books, then I'll certainly join everyone else in admonishing the show-runners. But my god, it's getting tiresome to read.
Â 
As for how it pertains to Sansa, Tyrion didn't want the marriage either and Sansa knew that. And that's straight from the books.
Â 


Â 


If they are setting him up for a giant fall, then they are likely to Jump the Shark with the audience, which to be fair is entirely possible. While he will certainly kill Shae, I would bet that she is going to be completely evil during the trial in order for us to sympathize with St Tyrion. I wouldn't be surprised if she is the only real witness and turned into the major factor in his conviction.
Â 
I then really doubt we will see the downward path he went on in ADWD to the same extent. I'm sure he may get drunk and mope about but I doubt there will be any threatening of servants or raping of slaves going on.
Â 
As for telling Sansa he didn't want the marriage anymore than she did, that is a lie. He had a choice and he wanted Winterfell despite knowing it would mean her brother's death. Tyrion lies to himself and convinces himself that he is a victim in his own head in many situations where he is not. His character in the books is pretty damn morally grey, but in the show not only have these qualities been removed, but they have given him extra nice qualities. It is now at the stage where it is no longer even vaguely the same character.Â 
Â 


im just curious, is it possible for there to be a show thread without it turning into a d&d bashing party? people need to realize that they make changes for a reason and that you need to wait longer before completely demonizing a diversion. they haven't murdered sansa's character. it is just ever so slightly different. people blow things way out of proportion.
and shut up already about "saint tyrion". it doesnt matter if he is a little nicer on the show. they had a likable character that they want to remain likable. its not hard to understand why they wouldnt have him kill a singer, or have sex with shae, or why he was nice to sansa. didnt he try to be nice to sansa in the books too?
oh, and dont forget, five episodes from now, HE IS GOING TO KILL HIS FATHER. is that dark enough for you guys. seriously, if you dont like how the show does things, stop watching it. more importantly, stop complaining.
Â 

Â 
Everyone is allowed to express an opinion and can watch and enjoy a program without having to be enthralled with the way the characters are portrayed. For example Dune is a great film but it could have been far better if they had tried to stick more closely to the book.
Â 
The problem with the changes being stuff we don't know argument, is that they have already made lots of changes for no reason other than they thought it might be a cool idea (babies in jars for example). A lot of changes seem to be about them trying to do their own characterisation and failing wildly in some instances, in comparison with the book characters. Talisa for example was a dire change and Cat may as well have not been in the series at all because she was so different and marginalised compared to the book character.Â 
Â 
And you are rightÂ HE IS GOING TO KILL HIS FATHER...one of the most evil men in Westeros. No one is going to bat an eyelid over that murder. If they also have the Tysha reveal it is going to be more than justifiable.Â
2616	Annara Snow	2014-05-05	Â 
Â 

I think that GRRM hinted in an interview that the death of Sansa's direwolf mean that she was no longer of the North/died as a Stark. So I don't think book Sansa will ever go North again.
Â 



Â 
I'm 100% sure that he never said anything of the sort. Especially since it's a popular fanon/theory that people bring up on this forum but never can find anything to back it up with.
Â 
Furthermore, it doesn't really make sense: for starters, Sansa's Stark identity and northern roots have only been been becoming stronger, and secondly, if she had had lost her Stark identity, why would she be sacrificing herself to rebuild Winterfell?
Â 
Also, Sansa's northern identity is not something that's making her more pliant and submissive, on the contrary: "I'm stronger within the walls of Winterfell" she thinks when she criticizes LF openly for not taking her home during the snow castle scene; thinking of Winterfell makes her gather the courage to decide to tell Lysa she wouldn't be marrying SR, etc.
Â 

Â 
Sex without desire is at the very least nauseating (as any woman who has tried it can attest), and desire is ultimately about the body. The judgements of the body are not enlightened ones.

Â 
I definitely agree with that, and nobody is obliged to feel sexual desire for anyone. I was talking about the repercussions of the hypothetical story and its messages, not the feelings of a character. If GRRM wanted a doom scenario for Sansa, there's no reason why he couldn't write her sacrificing herself to a Joffrey type or Robert Baratheon type character.
Â 

Given that even in the best case scenario, the Starks will need to be rebuilding Winterfell after ADOS, they will certainly need Sansa to make a good/wealthy marriage (since Arya certainly won't be available). Since Harry the Heir and Willas Tyrell have yet to be seen on screen, it doesn't seem likely that Sansa will end up with either of those nonentities, whereas Tyrion has been around from book 1.
I Â think future books will show Sansa as haunted by grief over her betrayal of her father (as a result of her minuscule book 1 actions), and she will make the decide to stay with Tyrion as a form of repentance. So I don't think Tyrion will force her to remain married (he maybe a rapist, and a whore monger but he likes the fantasy of being desired) but she will offer, for reasons that are both rational and moral (i.e not motivated by twu wuv but motivated by self sacrifice in exchange for Lannister gold to rebuild Winterfell). Tyrion will thus finally believe that he has obtained his fantasy (possession of a beautiful woman who will love him for himself), only for it to be the the same relationship he had with Shae, but with a much higher price.Â 
Sex without desire is at the very least nauseating (as any woman who has tried it can attest), and desire is ultimately about the body. The judgements of the body are not enlightened ones.
Perhaps D&D just don't get that a woman can make unemotional but moral decisions, so they will have the completion of the Tyrion Sansa marriage be about Twu Wuv and "aren't I lucky to have such a nice and funny guy."
Â 
I once shared your optimism about Tyrion and Sansa, but the show made me realise that it wasn't end game (my suspicions were raised as far back as season 2 when they eliminated SanSan and Tyrion's comment along the lines of "You'll surprise us yet Lady Stark") but season 3 confirmed it.
the show's lack of subtly kind of made the ending of the book easier to predict.
Â 

Â 
But they did not eliminate SanSan.Â  They just downplayed it, for various reasons, including not being very good at writing it, and being awful to showing subtext, but they didn't eliminate it - and they could have, if that was the idea. In that case, there would have been no need for emphasizing little moments between them, making a big deal of him rescuing her and expanding it compared to how it was in the show (and adding lines like "I didn't do it for you"), including that entire scene during the Blackwater which would be pretty pointless if the two aren't supposed to have any kind of important dynamic, or making Sandor outright imply that he would kill Joffrey to save Sansa, which he never does in the books but does in the show ("You will be grateful one day for the hateful things I do, when I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king".) The deleted scene from season 2 shows one of the reasons why it may be good that D&D they downplayed it in their own episodes: namely, they quite suck at writing it. It's extremely challenging, considering 1) that D&D seem unable to include the "true knight" theme from the books (it happens in Brienne's story, too), 2) I imagine they were quite insecure about potential romantic overtones between a grown man and a teenage girl on screen and whether/to which extent/how not to make Sandor look like a creep, since he's not supposed to be a villain like LF, 3) they really, really suck at conveying subtext and internal thoughts, so when characters aren't talking about someone or interacting with someone, they seem to forget about that person (see: Jon and Arya apparently not thinking about each other, the Stark kids in general when it comes to each other) and while that would not be a problem with Sandor who has Arya to talk to (however, see point 2), it is with Sansa. If the lack of subtext/foreshadowing in this show is a proof that something has been eliminated/is unimportant for the future story, there is a much stronger case to argue that Jon's parentage will be unimportant for the story's resolution on the show, and we know that this is definitely not true, from D&D's story about their first meeting with GRRM.
Â 
In any case, the idea that they have eliminated SanSan can be easily disproved by the fact that so many Unsullied fans and reviewers picked up on "something" and that it was shipped quite a bit, and the interviewers who talked to GRRM in this interview even believed that 'the shows have stoked these fires' (of SanSan shipping).
Â 
So, you seem to mostly basing your theory on two things that aren't actually true; as for the rest, I have seen no textual evidence that Sansa would start to be overcome with remorse for the supposed role in Ned's death (and one would think that, if sheÂ  felt that way, that would've come up much before, say. in book 1 or 2) - again, it's another piece of popular fanon/something that people like to say on the forum, but that hasn't reallyÂ  been a part of the books. Nor do I see any other signs that this self-sacrificial marriage-prostitution future is where Sansa's arc is heading; if anything, it seems to be going the opposite way, with the way Sansa's views on marriage and sex have developed and the kind of people she's been interacting with and influenced by lately in the books (including Mya and Myranda). Nor would Sansa's training under LF have any point if all her "game playing" is about being a good wife/prostitute for Tyrion. She should have been learning from book!Shae, in that case.
Â 
I also don't see any evidence of this supposed "Tyrion/Sansa endgame" on the show. It's not like they've made them romantically interested in each other, and there's nothing there that isn't easily explained by the wish to keep Tyrion as an unambiguous good guy despite being the husband of a 14-year old girlÂ  forced into marriage by her captors, and to keep both Tyrion and Sansa likable to the audience whose capability for complex moral situations D&D really don't tend to overestimate, to put it mildly. (It's not like there was a way to eliminate the Sansa/Tyrion forced marriage as a plot point.) I've seen lots of people comment on the "You may still survive us" line as a possible piece of foreshadowing of Sansa surviving the series. but I don't think I've ever seen anyone else consider it foreshadowing of a Sansa/Tyrion 'endgame', not do I see why it would be. (If anything, wouldn't it imply that Tyrion dies before Sansa? And an ability to survive captivity doesn't imply self-sacrice, does it?) And if Tyrion being nicer to Sansa, and Tyrion and Sansa being friendlier to each other, is a "unsubtle sign"/confirmation of Tyrion and Sansa ending up together, you could just as well take the fact that Tyrion is much nicer to Podrick and that they have a stronger relationship as evidence of Tyrion and Podrick hooking up in the end.
Â 
It seems like you just came up with that theory and then saw supposed evidence for it everywhere.

Â 
In the books, yes, But a lot of the Unsullied think, or have thought for a long time, that Tywin is a pretty nice and cool dude, what with him "being nice to Arya" and the show downplaying his atrocities. Hopefully this season changes that, with the emphasis on the deaths of Elia and the Targaryen children, and hopefully the Tysha story, too. But they have their work cut out.
Â 
Making Tywin more likable is one of those things that prove that many of the changes that D&D make are really not about some super-secret knowledge of the character's endgame.

Hopefully this season changes that, with the emphasis on the deaths of Elia and the Targaryen children, and hopefully the Tysha story, too. But they have their work cut out.
Â 
Making Tywin more likable is one of those things that prove that many of the changes that D&D make are really not about some super-secret knowledge of the character's endgame.


Â 
The problem with the Tyrion jumping the shark is not going to be Tywin, even though yes, he's quite likeable as Charles Dance...it's going to be Shae, there is no way her testimony, which the TV audience will know was forced..can turn them against her enough to make her murder by Tyrion even half way justified. Â It wasn't even justified in the book when she was a POS, now she's the nicest whore in Westeros and Essos.
Â 
I'm not sure you're right about Sansa and Tyrion end game....why keep bringing up how she has totally no hard feelings toward him and he was a great guy...unless they're going to reconnect at some point?

I'm not saying they aren't going to meet again, I just don't see why meeting again and being more or less friendly would have to imply ending up living together and having regular sex for the rest of their lives (or at all)?

Â 
Well, D&D like to beat you over the head with things, so that, 's a point in favor of Sansa/Tyrion having a 'happy' ending, we already know they were sort of friendly, why does she need to wax poetic about what a victim he was, as if she feels sorry for him if all that is in the future is them meeting again? Â However, on the flipside, D&D do a lot of totally random, meaningless stuff, so that's a point for, random dialogue, because they're D&D.

I think they can get round the Shae thing, although it will be hard, by making her give the "nail in the coffin" testimony in the trial. Tywin is yet another character they have changed and not for the better and they will indeed have their work cut out with him and Shae and making that believable. Great examples of another two characters needlessly changed, whose endgame, as you say, we know.Â 
Â 
Edit: Although given how they thought the Jaime / Cersei scene played out, they may have made some other terrible errors in filming scenes.

It also concerns me that they have had Sansa keep the ring, although this might just be a costume issue ad one the showrunners have just not thought about, or alternatively have some new "cool" invented storyline concerning it for Season 4. More worrying is the fact both PD and SK were apparently filming in Iceland earlier this year. It is more of an unfounded fear, but I am really hoping if they do Sansa's dream, that they keep Sandor in it.Â

ETA: why would PD and SK be filming this year for GOT? Filming wrapped for Season 4 in 2013. Am I missing something here?
I should probably reserve judgment on the ring, since for all I know it will disappear discreetly with no further explanation. Still bugs, though.

The show doesn't do dreams, apart from Bran.Â  They've been ironclad on that (the only exception was the Sansa period bit, but that was just reused footage from the previous episode).

The Iceland filming was the Bloody Gate (Arya and the Hound also filmed there).

Â 
So, you're saying that, instead of dreaming of Sandor, she dreams of a threesome with Tyrion and Shae? 
Â 
On a more serious note - as Colonel pointed out, it's really unlikely we'll see Sansa dream scenes at all, or anyone's, apart from Bran's, where they really have no choice. The show does not do dreams, flashbacks or subtext and barely ever does foreshadowing.
Â 
I also don't think the show is too concerned with exploring teenage girl sexuality... or for that reason, female sexuality in general, unless they can get their clothes off.
2626	Newstar	2014-05-05	Yeah, I really don't see any cause for concern. The show doesn't do non-Bran dreams, with the exception of Sansa's riot dream, and that was clearly a one-off.

2628	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-05	Â 
I will say one thing that bugged me: Sansa licking her fingers after eating in the Lysa/Sansa scene. I can sort of buy it, that Sansa's "letting her hair down" by relaxing her manners around Lysa now that she believes she's with a family member she can trust, but I have trouble believing that Sansa, who of anyone would have had proper etiquette drilled into her, would ever be that ill-mannered, even in a relaxed, unguarded moment. Even in our Middle Ages, where table manners were quite a different animal, licking one's fingers was still frowned upon.


Â 
I'm pretty sure breast feeding a nine year old while holding court from the throne of a Lord Paramount would have been frowned upon too,
Â 
When in Rome!
2629	greensleeves	2014-05-05	Â 
Â 
That was just one of several slips from LF IMO, he didn't have Sansa color her hair, just pull up her hood after several archers already saw her, she still has that gaudy gold Lannister ring and now SR knows her true identity-either it doesn't ultimately mean anything and is harmless-(which I can't see, why include it if it doesn't matter) or it means that LF is getting sloppy and he has left clues for people who are coming to the Vale to find.


Â 
There's a theory that LF is purposefully letting the people of the Vale figure out for themselves that Alayne=Sansa. Â After all, who would believe anything LF just told them out right? Â In that case, it's not sloppy but careful planning.
Â 
(He's done this before with Ned.)
Â 


Â 
But they did not eliminate SanSan.Â  They just downplayed it, for various reasons, including not being very good at writing it, and being awful to showing subtext, but they didn't eliminate it - and they could have, if that was the idea. In that case, there would have been no need for emphasizing little moments between them, making a big deal of him rescuing her and expanding it compared to how it was in the show (and adding lines like "I didn't do it for you"), including that entire scene during the Blackwater which would be pretty pointless if the two aren't supposed to have any kind of important dynamic, or making Sandor outright imply that he would kill Joffrey to save Sansa, which he never does in the books but does in the show ("You will be grateful one day for the hateful things I do, when I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king".) The deleted scene from season 2 shows one of the reasons why it may be good that D&D they downplayed it in their own episodes: namely, they quite suck at writing it. It's extremely challenging, considering 1) that D&D seem unable to include the "true knight" theme from the books (it happens in Brienne's story, too), 2) I imagine they were quite insecure about potential romantic overtones between a grown man and a teenage girl on screen and whether/to which extent/how not to make Sandor look like a creep, since he's not supposed to be a villain like LF, 3) they really, really suck at conveying subtext and internal thoughts, so when characters aren't talking about someone or interacting with someone, they seem to forget about that person (see: Jon and Arya apparently not thinking about each other, the Stark kids in general when it comes to each other) and while that would not be a problem with Sandor who has Arya to talk to (however, see point 2), it is with Sansa. If the lack of subtext/foreshadowing in this show is a proof that something has been eliminated/is unimportant for the future story, there is a much stronger case to argue that Jon's parentage will be unimportant for the story's resolution on the show, and we know that this is definitely not true, from D&D's story about their first meeting with GRRM.
Â 
In any case, the idea that they have eliminated SanSan can be easily disproved by the fact that so many Unsullied fans and reviewers picked up on "something" and that it was shipped quite a bit, and the interviewers who talked to GRRM in this interview even believed that 'the shows have stoked these fires' (of SanSan shipping).


Â 
I've actually seen more shipping of Sansa with Margaery from unsullied viewers than SanSan. (I see a lot of SansaxTyrion and even SansaxLF for that matter)
Â 
They gave a lot of Sandor's significant lines with Sansa to Littlefinger and just cut others. Â You could argue that the cut scenes are because of timing issues, but why give so many of his scenes to Baelish? Â Aiden Gillan already had plenty of onscreen time, and they didn't have to write a single line there.
Â 
Then there's the fact that Sophie and Rory have absolutely no chemistry. Â Rory has stated that he doesn't see their relationship as romantic/sexual at all and seems to imply that he's skeeved out by the very idea. Â Maybe they changed it to accommodate him? Â I don't know, but their show-dynamic is missing that aspect for me. Â It seems like this was intentional either because the SanSan relationship is just unimportant to them or because they view it negatively.
Â 
Â

Whatever changes they may or may not have made, I doubt it was to accommodate the actors, if it's that significant a story element.
2631	Le Cygne	2014-05-05	<snip>Agree with all of your points! They even added St. Tyrion to the Jaime and Brienne goodbye scene. He gave Pod a present instead of not giving him another thought. Some of us were even afraid he'd be the one to tell Jaime to send Brienne and Pod off. They made Jaime darker, fans of his story have yet another scene to erase from memory.I don't think the St. Tyrion stuff is limited to Sansa's scenes, they just don't find her interesting, the same way they didn't find Cat interesting, and used her to prop up Tyrion, much the same way they are using the Hound to prop up Arya. I think Jorah fans will be singing the blues when he props up St. Tyrion, too.Just commenting on the romance stuff ---Not seeing Tyrion/Sansa in the books or show, at all, she's being polite. If that's romance, there must be a new definition. Usually it involves attraction, kissing, missing, that sort of thing. Like what's going on with Sansa/Sandor, and it's been on the show somewhat, too, certainly more than with anyone else.Â  Also Rory isn't saying that, he was recently hinting there's something there:(That link doesn't work anymore, will find another...)

Â 
Heh. Just because Lysa is shamelessly socially inappropriate doesn't mean that Sansa would subconsciously stoop to her level. Sansa was around Cersei, who was often rude and crass, for extended periods of time and never sank to her level.
Â 
Â 
Â 
There's a theory that LF is purposefully letting the people of the Vale figure out for themselves that Alayne=Sansa. Â After all, who would believe anything LF just told them out right? Â In that case, it's not sloppy but careful planning.
Â 
I'd like to think so, because in this episode it was a bit ridiculous. "Now that some of the guards are looking at us and have clearly seen your red hair, you might want to pull up your hood, though this will in no way negate the fact that a few of them have already seen your hair. Oh, and you don't have to bother tucking your redhaired braid behind your back, either." Seriously?
Â 
Â 
Â 
I've actually seen more shipping of Sansa with Margaery from unsullied viewers
Â 
Not surprising, especially after that scene in 3x07. I have no problem with that, and it's not like it's crazily farfetched; Sansa seemed pretty taken with Margaery in the books (in a purely platonic way), and lesbian Margaery is one of the more popular reader theories (...even if there's very little evidence for it and it's seemingly contradicted by Littlefinger stating that Margaery doesn't particularly want her maidenhead).
Â 
Â 
Â 
Rory (...) seems to imply that he's skeeved out by the very idea.
Â 
He's sort of caught, though. I mean, is he going to wax rhapsodic in interviews about his 40/30something character's romantic obsession with a 13-year-old girl? No one wants to be that guy. There was one interview where he was asked about something SanSan related and he was all "She's a wee girl and I hang out with her mum and dad," which is probably the only answer he could give, apart from going the Aidan Gillen route and trolling the interviewers. Even if he does have some real repugnance for the idea as opposed to making a big show of outrage, I doubt that would change anything with the writers, though. I seem to recall McCann was pissed about other changes they made--cutting the take where he yelled "Enough!" or similar that should have gone in 2x04--and the writers/directors went ahead and made them.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Then there's the fact that Sophie and Rory have absolutely no chemistry.
Â 
Does she have chemistry with Aidan Gillen or Peter Dinklage, the other adult men with whom she has several interactions, though? If she doesn't have chemistry with any of them, Rory McCann's relative lack of it with Sophie Turner would hardly seem to matter. It's kind of weird to talk about chemistry in this context given the crazy age difference, unless you mean in a purely actor/actor sense, like Rory McCann's great rapport with Maisie Williams, which just pops off the screen, and that's kind of an unfair comparison. Maisie Williams seems to have chemistry with all of her costars (again, in a pure actor/actor sense): Tywin, Syrio, Thoros, etc. etc. In comparison, Sophie Turner doesn't seem to be one of those "chemistry with a wooden door" actors or actresses who bounce well off everyone else. That doesn't mean she's a bad actress, but it does mean that she needs the right actors/actresses with whom she can establish a great connection.
Â 
Â 
Â 
He gave Pod a present instead of not giving him another thought. Some of us were even afraid he'd be the one to tell Jaime to send Brienne and Pod off.
Â 
It does seem implied, with the Tyrion/Jaime 4x04 scene ending with a discussion of Sansa's predicament, Jaime's spiel to Brienne about Pod needing to leave the city, and Bronn giving Pod the axe, that Tyrion is behind Pod accompanying Brienne and that he knows all about Brienne's quest to find Sansa. That's another deviation from the books, since Book Tyrion has no idea what Pod's doing and knew nothing of Brienne's quest for Sansa.
Â 
...I'm kind of depressed in retrospect that the show did away with Pod's crush on Sansa. I thought it was so cute in the books.

Â 
Really? On the contrary, I thought they had lots of chemistry in the few scenes they had together, considering how little substantial dialogue there was, it's one of the things that saved some of the scenes that barely had any dialogue. In the sense that you could feel something, some kind of a strange tension there. But people often seem to have different ideas of what constitutes chemistry. They aren't going to start exchanging jokes and witticisms, obviously.
Â 
I'm curious, who do you think Sophie has chemistry on the show with?
Â 
I'm amused that you think that Rory has so much clout that D&D would change a major storyline just to "accommodate" Rory's unease, especially with how many of his scenes and lines they cut. I suppose if he was Charles Dance or Sean Bean, it may be a bit more believable, but still unlikely, since actors don't get to decide what happens on the show.
Â 
And Rory is more or less being in a laughing/good mood every time he goes on about Sophie being a lass and him drinking with her parents, doesn't seem like the guy who's storming into the offices to ask "LESS SCENES WITH SOPHIE, DAMN IT!"... surely, if he was storming into the offices to ask something, he would've been asking for more screentime and lines. The the last time he was asked about SanSan at a convention, he said that it could happen "maybe in the end" but he just doesn't want to think about it because of the whole drinking with her parents thing.
Â 
Â 

Â 
I've actually seen more shipping of Sansa with Margaery from unsullied viewers than SanSan. (I see a lot of SansaxTyrion and even SansaxLF for that matter)
Â 

Â 
Sansa and Margaery had lots of screentime together, and shipping two good-looking women is generally a popular thing to do in fandoms (in the Buffy fandom, Buffy/Faith was almost just as popular as Buffy's canon pairings with Angel and Spike - who were/are very popular themselves andÂ  had lots and lots of development, screentime and chemistry). I'm not sure how the fact that a lot of Unsullied ship them proves that SanSan has been "eliminated". Downplayed yes, eliminated - no. * If it had been, why would the Unsullied reviewers and fans be shipping them or noticing their connection in the first place (especially if the actors really have that little chemistry as you're saying)? And it's not a case of two people being canonically married (Tyrion/Sansa) or the show telegraphing the villain's creepy sexual interest as much as possible (LF/Sansa), so people were left to just wonder "what is this" or think that there's no relationship between them at all.
Â 
Sansa and LF - lots of screentime, LF is obviously creeping on her interested in her in that way; Sansa and Tyrion, also lots of screentime, Tyrion is the most popular character on the show, some people will see any marriage as a big deal no matter what (someone was just arguing in another thread that Tyrion and Sansa will end up together in books andÂ  show because "marriage is a sacred vow" and the HS would not allow it annulled) and, most of all, it manages to touch all those "Nice Guy Â<U+0099>" buttons that are so widespread in fandoms, including this one (you can see it A LOT in the book fandom, too), almost as much as Dany/Jorah. (I can only imagine the Dany/Quentyn response, if he is cast on the show).
Â 
And, if you blame Rory's unease about romancing someone Sophie's age on the show for downplaying their connection (though I don't know why that would be the case, so many of their interactions have little or nothing explicitly romantic, including the famous scene where he tells her about his scars), are you saying that Peter Dinklage or Aidan Gillen or Natalie Dormer have told the producers that they would be totally down with some love scenes between them and Sophie? Otherwise, I don't see the significance of Rory's comments. For that matter, I don't remember that Peter ever being asked about a possible Tyrion/Sansa romance, so he may say something similar to Rory, for all you know. (Although he was once asked about the 'love triangle' and he corrected the interviewer by saying that it's not a love triangle since that would imply love on all sides- just a 'pickle'.) And Aidan Gillen is totally trolling the readers and talking in interviews about LF's "avuncular" and "fatherly" feelings for Sansa and insisting that they're totally not creepy. 
Â 
* Maybe it's time to ask, what exactly do you mean by "SanSan"? Do you mean some explicit romantic stuff, or just relationship in general?
Sure, there's been nothing explicitly romantic between them, but it's not like there was that much of it in the books either while they were around each other. And a lot of the Unsullied still saw their relationship in those terms; unlike, say, Sandor/Arya, where people are fortunately clear on it really not being like that at all.

2637	Martin Lasarte	2014-05-05	Many people point out that Petyr has no known siblings that could be "Alayne's" parents, and that not making her a bastard means diminishing her storyline somehow. That's true, but Petyr could still claim her parent is a bastard sibling of him, which would also make her a bastard. That would explain why no one's heard of another Baelish child.
The fact that he doesn't clarify what's her status when he introduces her as "Alayne, my niece" doesn't mean he's saying she's a trueborn girl.
Besides, even if the does claim Alayne is her trueborn niece, Petyr's family is quite obscure. I doubt anyone keeps track of his family tree.

2639	Annara Snow	2014-05-05	BTW I was just looking at WiC recap of reviews and it may be interesting to note that, out of the 8 Unsullied reviews they link, Sansa's defense of Tyrion is only mentioned in one, and it's like this:
Â 
Â 

Â 
They pass through the Bloody Gate and Petyr gives a glass bird to that bitty-nibbling little shit Robin, who promptly dumps the gift out â<U+0080><U+009C>the Moon Doorâ<U+0080><U+009D>. Kids! Lysa (Kate Dickie) is all about having Sansa around â<U+0080><U+0093> she is her â<U+0080><U+009C>flesh and bloodâ<U+0080><U+009D> after all! She then talks smack about Tyrion, and Sansa kinda defends him. A smidge. Lysa makes it clear that Sansa has to remain on the DL while sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s in Castle Breastenstein.
Â 
After Sansa leaves we learn a biggie: Lysa killed her husband Jon Arryn on Littlefingerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s orders. So the Lannisters didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t kill him after all? Wait, what?! Or wait â<U+0080><U+0093> who is Petyr working for? He called the Tyrells â<U+0080><U+009C>new friendsâ<U+0080><U+009D> so they canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have been behind Arrynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s murder, could they? Later, they have insanely loud sex (Lysa amusingly warns anyone who will listen, â<U+0080><U+009C>Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m warning you, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m going to scream when my husband makes love to me!â<U+0080><U+009D>), and Sansa has to listen to it. Gah. As though watching her own father get beheaded werenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t torture enough!

Â 
Â 
So, it seems safe to say that this supposed Sansa/Tyrion super-shippiness of this episodeÂ  hasn't been noticed by any of the Unsullied reviewers, at least (I haven't read the Sullied ones, yet).
Â 


call me crazy, but i always felt like littlefinger claiming alayne to be his daughter was almost like him living out a twisted fantasy where he and catelyn had children. but maybe i'm just over thinking this


Â 
You're not overthinking it. It's a very popular opinion. He even tells her "you could have been my daughter" in the books. It's super-twisted because he also wants to groom her into his lover and Cat replacement.
Â 
It's sad that so much of that subtext - and LF trying to replace Ned in Sansa's mind and heart - will be lost on the show since she is his "niece". I assume that this was done because D&D were scared that some of the audience would think that Cat actually slept with LF and that he was Sansa's real father.

2640	Newstar	2014-05-05	So, it seems safe to say that this supposed Sansa/Tyrion super-shippiness of this episodeÂ  hasn't been noticed by any of the Unsullied reviewers, at least (I haven't read the Sullied ones, yet).
Â 
Well, of course that 4x05 tidbit isn't going to jump out at the Unsullied, because the very reason it jumps out is that the book's equivalent lines have an entirely different meaning, and the Sullied (heh) have the benefit of the books for comparison. In of itself, Sansa's defence of Tyrion seems like small potatoes, but that Sansa's "They made me marry him. I never wanted it" (Sansa defending herself for marrying Tyrion on the basis that she was forced into it) is changed to "They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to" (Sansa defending both Tyrion and herself) is a different story.
Â 
Also, while we're talking Unsullied reviewers, we have this from the Unsullied New York Times ArtsBeat review of 4x04:
I was also touched by Tyrion and Sansa each defending the other when they had nothing to gain from it. The evident tenderness in their relationship, however involuntarily they entered into it, is heartwarming.
Â 
Of course, we Sullied know that in the books, Tyrion and Sansa both believed the other capable of murder, that Sansa's "He did nothing" in defence of Tyrion only comes after Littlefinger explains to her that Tyrion did nothing, and that nothing of the sort took place. However, in the show, Tyrion and Sansa stoutly defending each other was picked up on by the reviewer as evidence of their mutual tenderness. That bit in 4x04 might seem insignificant on the shippiness meter--they don't think the other's capable of murder, big whoop--just as the bit in 4x05 might seem insignificant on the shippiness meter, but the little things matter, the little things add up, and this season, there have been a lot of non-book little things.

2641	Colonel Green	2014-05-05	That's true, but Petyr could still claim her parent is a bastard sibling of him, which would also make her a bastard.


No it wouldn't, if she herself was trueborn.
2642	Zorn Gottes	2014-05-05	I fear they replaced Sandor with Tyrion... Sandor still thinks of Sansa, but she didn't mention him for almost 2 seasons, how can they possibly bring up her feelings for him NOW? I'm afraid that ship has sailedÂ
2643	Annara Snow	2014-05-05	No it wouldn't, if she herself was trueborn.


Â 
Yeah, it wouldn't make her a bastard. It would make her very lowborn, though.

Â 
Never say never. If the Hound survives this season and D&D don't clearly kill him off when Arya abandons him (pulling a Talisa), that means there's a pretty good chance he's going to come back into the storyline in a significant (read: something more than digging graves) way down the road. You might feel better after the end of the season, is all I'm saying.
2645	sastelise	2014-05-05	There was something about the Eyrie scenes that didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>tÂ  fit overall. I canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t quite describe it â<U+0080><U+0093> it felt a bit rushed. Still there are few changes that I thought were fascinating in terms of their potential influence on TV Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s story:
* LFâ<U+0080><U+0099>s emphasis on the difficulty and danger of the road leading up to the blood gate. Maybe itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s nothing, but my reaction was that this was a foreshadowing, letting viewers know the layout of a terrain that might be important later on.
* Lysaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s enthusiastic reaction at seeing Sansa and her subsequent crazed and twisted expression of jealousy. In the book, I got the impression that Lysa didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t feign much enthusiasm during Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s arrival. Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s observation of her auntsâ<U+0080><U+0099> wild mood swings early on makes me think that sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll be happy to see her aunt go out the moon door and more than willing to oblige LF with his proposed cover-up. (Though no Marillion yet)
* Sweet Robin as Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s husband? I canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t remember if that arrangement was alluded to in the book, but itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s another reason for Sansa to be happy about waving buh-bye to Lysa. I doubt LF would propose such a union.
* Sansa as LFâ<U+0080><U+0099>s niece. I think LF wants people to be suspicious about that! I think he wants them to believe that sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s his â<U+0080><U+009C>niece.â<U+0080><U+009D> As long as sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not recognized as Sansa Stark, having people believe that sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s his secret lover posing as his â<U+0080><U+009C>nieceâ<U+0080><U+009D> benefits him more than the potential that such a dynamic implicates him in Lysaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death. It benefits his ego as well as his attempt to transition Sansa into his actual lover.
All in all, these changes seem to set up LF as Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s savior and that may influence her to accept and embrace him.Â  I suspect that Sansa may never learn about Lysa poisoning her husband at the behest of LF, which is why they revealed it to the audience now instead of waiting until the moon door scene. Without that knowledge, Sansa wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t really understand how detrimental LF has been to her family.
Â
2646	Martin Lasarte	2014-05-05	No it wouldn't, if she herself was trueborn.


You are right, I hadn't thought of that. But still, she could be a bastard's bastard, wich would make her even more lowborn.
2647	greensleeves	2014-05-05	Does she have chemistry with Aidan Gillen or Peter Dinklage, the other adult men with whom she has several interactions, though? If she doesn't have chemistry with any of them, Rory McCann's relative lack of it with Sophie Turner would hardly seem to matter. It's kind of weird to talk about chemistry in this context given the crazy age difference, unless you mean in a purely actor/actor sense, like Rory McCann's great rapport with Maisie Williams, which just pops off the screen, and that's kind of an unfair comparison. Maisie Williams seems to have chemistry with all of her costars (again, in a pure actor/actor sense): Tywin, Syrio, Thoros, etc. etc. In comparison, Sophie Turner doesn't seem to be one of those "chemistry with a wooden door" actors or actresses who bounce well off everyone else. That doesn't mean she's a bad actress, but it does mean that she needs the right actors/actresses with whom she can establish a great connection.

Â 
Â 
I actually thought Rory McCann's acting was pretty bad in the first three seasons (including his scenes with Maise Williams). Â He's really improved this season (imo anyways). Â It might have had something to do with the prosthetic he has to wear... I know some of the behind the scenes stuff mentions that it's ridiculously uncomfortable.
Â 
Â 

Really? On the contrary, I thought they had lots of chemistry in the few scenes they had together, considering how little substantial dialogue there was, it's one of the things that saved some of the scenes that barely had any dialogue. In the sense that you could feel something, some kind of a strange tension there. But people often seem to have different ideas of what constitutes chemistry. They aren't going to start exchanging jokes and witticisms, obviously.
Â 
I'm curious, who do you think Sophie has chemistry on the show with?

Â 
I think Sophie Turner is a very talented actress and that she's only gotten more talented as the show goes on. Â Her scenes with almost all of the actors work wonderfully well. Â In her scenes with Baelish, for example, I really get a whole obsessive/uncomfortable-but-desperate vibe.
Â 
In the books, I do get the 'vibe' from Sandor's scenes with Sansa that he has some complicated feelings about her. Â In the show... meh. Â I guess it's just a matter of opinion though.
Â 

I'm amused that you think that Rory has so much clout that D&D would change a major storyline just to "accommodate" Rory's unease, especially with how many of his scenes and lines they cut. I suppose if he was Charles Dance or Sean Bean, it may be a bit more believable, but still unlikely, since actors don't get to decide what happens on the show.

They are pretty much forced to accommodate to the product he gives them. (Hence the cut scenes and lines you mention.) Â It's hard to tell how much of the cutting was due to them just really not liking what they were getting and being forced to cut something they wanted vs. not putting the effort in because that aspect of the story was unimportant to them. Â 
Â 

Sansa and Margaery had lots of screentime together, and shipping two good-looking women is generally a popular thing to do in fandoms (in the Buffy fandom, Buffy/Faith was almost just as popular as Buffy's canon pairings with Angel and Spike - who were/are very popular themselves andÂ  had lots and lots of development, screentime and chemistry). I'm not sure how the fact that a lot of Unsullied ship them proves that SanSan has been "eliminated". Downplayed yes, eliminated - no. * If it had been, why would the Unsullied reviewers and fans be shipping them or noticing their connection in the first place (especially if the actors really have that little chemistry as you're saying)? And it's not a case of two people being canonically married (Tyrion/Sansa) or the show telegraphing the villain's creepy sexual interest as much as possible (LF/Sansa), so people were left to just wonder "what is this" or think that there's no relationship between them at all.

You have a very different picture of fandom than I do. Â Femslash always seems to be the bastard child of fandom. Â Male slash (usually just called slash... it needs no distinguishment) gets amplified. Â My memory is getting rusty, but I seem to recall *a lot* of Angel/Spike fan activity. Â I don't recall much Buffy/Faith at all.
Â 
Â 

And, if you blame Rory's unease about romancing someone Sophie's age on the show for downplaying their connection (though I don't know why that would be the case, so many of their interactions have little or nothing explicitly romantic, including the famous scene where he tells her about his scars), are you saying that Peter Dinklage or Aidan Gillen or Natalie Dormer have told the producers that they would be totally down with some love scenes between them and Sophie? Otherwise, I don't see the significance of Rory's comments. For that matter, I don't remember that Peter ever being asked about a possible Tyrion/Sansa romance, so he may say something similar to Rory, for all you know. (Although he was once asked about the 'love triangle' and he corrected the interviewer by saying that it's not a love triangle since that would imply love on all sides- just a 'pickle'.) And Aidan Gillen is totally trolling the readers and talking in interviews about LF's "avuncular" and "fatherly" feelings for Sansa and insisting that they're totally not creepy. 


I obviously don't know what was going on behind the scenes, but I do think that if the show was trying to include a romantic aspect to the Sandor-Sansa relationship they would have emphasized that with Rory. Â His comments to me suggest that either no such emphasis took place or he chose to reject that advice or maybe a mix. Â I understand that it's an awkward topic, but it seems like he could have been more circumspect had he chosen to be.

Â 


Â 
Lysa told Sansa she was to marry her son in no uncertain terms as soon as she learned her real identity in ASOS. There was also the lovely moment when she asked Sansa if she was pregnant, and then expressed relief that she was still a virgin, since she wouldn't want her son to get "the dwarf's leavings". Sansa thought to herself that it was because Lysa wanted her claim to WF, like everyone else. She was mentally preparing to tell Lysa she wouldn't agree to marry SR no matter what, when Lysa called her to her after the Snow castle scene.
Â 
The only difference is that Lysa didn't show any jealousy of Sansa in the book until she saw LF kissing her.
2649	Karmarni	2014-05-05	I fear they replaced Sandor with Tyrion... Sandor still thinks of Sansa, but she didn't mention him for almost 2 seasons, how can they possibly bring up her feelings for him NOW? I'm afraid that ship has sailedÂ

Jon didn't mention Ghost for two seasons either, but then says he missed him. OK, guess he must have. The show has a way of going back to pick up story lines that seem missplaced.
2650	Newstar	2014-05-05	I actually thought Rory McCann's acting was pretty bad in the first three seasons (including his scenes with Maise Williams).
Â 
Oh, thank God, I thought I was the only one who thought that (although I did love his rapport with Maisie Williams). Some truly atrocious line readings in there. I agree that he has improved this season, although at the rate his scenes are going, by the end of the season his dialogue will be made up entirely of "Fucks," like that scene from The Wire.

I think it's most likely to set up Arya and the Hound's going there a few episodes from now, where they're very likely to have a much worse time of it (something has to "kill" the Hound, after all, and I'm hard-pressed as to what else it could be at this point).
Â 
Speaking of the Eyrie, one of the things I was kind of on the lookout for in this episode was to see if they revised the look of the Eyrie at all to be more in line with the books, but there's still no sign of anything akin to the Gates of the Moon.Â  In fact, if anything, the Bloody Gate appears to have taken its place.Â  But given that they tore down the Eyrie's high hall after filming this season, I still expect them to move by the end of season 5.

There's lots of both. Joss Whedon famously had an online dialogue with fans during season 3 in which he said that Buffy/Faith was never meant to be about sexual tension, but then, after the fans started giving their 'evidence' from the show, said that he has changed his mind and their reading was completely legitimate. (and, amazingly, it's not just the straight men who ship it in this case)

Do you really think they would have tried to emphasize romantic aspects in a relationship between an adult man and a 13-year old girl, unless they were trying to make it super-creepy and disturbing a la LF/Sansa?

Â 
The "Bad Girls" episode of BTVS pretty much introduced me to femslash, although from what I recall of that fandom, as popular as Buffy/Faith was, male/male slash seemed way more popular in the fandom and that popularity also bled into the show by way of meta references and jokes (Spike/Xander jokes, Angel/Spike innuendo, etc. etc.).
Â 
To be fair to Joss Whedon, I could see the Buffy/Faith sexual tension not coming across had they cast someone else in the role, though. Eliza Dushku pretty much oozed sexual tension from every pore back then.

Â 
Yeah, the show tends to completely ignore important things - including relationships - until they become relevant to the plot point that's happening that season, or that episode. So, people usually don't talk about each other while they're away from each other, family members are completely absent from the story before the seasons when they are cast (Shireen, Blackfish and Edmure), there's little foreshadowing for.. well, anything (how many hints were there ever about Jon's parentage?). Look at how worried people were here that the Unsullied wouldn't remember Jon Arryn until they talk about him for a few episodes, and look how that turned out - nobody seems to have missed the importance of that reveal.
Â 
If Sandor indeed is to play a role in later books/seasons and if he's to have a significant storyline with Sansa, the show will keep his status ambiguous at the end of this season, and bring him back at some point in a later season (and the probability is higher since he's likely to be close to the Vale in books and show). Then they'll run a few Sandor/Sansa moments in "previously on" (The Old Gods and the New and Blackwater are likely candidates), and things will just proceed according to the plan.
Â 
Meanwhile, we're not going to be seeing Sansa's internal thoughts, dreams and fantasies because the show doesn't do that stuff. She's just going to be "learning the game" from LF and interacting with the people in the Vale for the time being.

Buffy/Faith femslash made its way in the show, too, and very early on, in every season 3 episode written by Doug Petrie. Even before "Bad Girls", here's this from episode 3.7 "Revelations":
Â 

	Spoiler 

Cordelia:  So, are you dating somebody or not?

Buffy angles her eyes up and sways around a bit, considering what she 
should say.

Buffy:  I wouldn't use the word 'dating', (looks at them) but I am going 
out with somebody. Tonight, as a matter of fact.

Willow:  Really? Who?

Faith puts her hand on Xander's shoulder and pulls him aside a little so 
she can squeeze in.

Faith:  Yo, what's up? (nudges Buffy's shoulder) Hey, time to motorvate.

Buffy:  (puts her arm around Faith) Really, we're just good friends.

The two Slayers head out of the club together.




Â 
And in season 4, there's the way that 
	Spoiler Faith, as played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, clearly enjoyed her new body during the Buffy/Faith body swap.

2661	Mad Monkey	2014-05-05	As I said in the other thread, I didn't like how the Tyrion whitewashing continued to plague Sansa's narrative. Â I thought her defence of him was a bit much.
2662	Raksha 2014	2014-05-05	I was disappointed that they've made Sansa LF's niece rather than his bastard daughter. Â Sansa's pushing herself to be "bastard brave" was, I felt, a significant step in her emotional development; feeling both hidden and bolder due to her bastard status. Â And I think making her LF's fake niece is less squicky if LF continues to touch Sansa, and less dramatic.
Â 
I wasn't sure if TV-Sansa was lying when she was babbling about LF thinking her a "stupid little girl", or she really believed it. Â 
Â 
I thought Kate Dickie did a marvelous job, and actually pushed LF into some credible acting.

I think it would be quite credible that Sansa would have extremely low self esteem at this point.
2666	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-06	4. Cat was fat? That entire conversation was a bit off. Â It is not that I disliked it, it's just weird. I also liked how Sansa used the same mantra people assessed her and defended herself with it. "I am stupid little girl, silly little girl..."Â Â 


Â 
Â 
I have a feeling this is just some symptom of the Lysa vs. Catelyn thing, that in fact it was actually Lysa and now she's feeding Sansa some disinformation (to further Lysa one-upping her dead sister).
(Plus the writer may be trolling book readers, since Lysa's grown stout in the books, but Kate Dickie is not that way in the show.)
Â 
Â 


Â 
Â 
I'm curious, who do you think Sophie has chemistry on the show with?
Â 


Â

I think Sophie had (ironically) decent chemistry in her scenes with Cersei (Lena) around the Blackwater period, and Joffrey (Jack). I hesitate to say "good" chemistry because the scenes were chock full of hostility, but Sansa mocking Joffrey or being shocked at Cersei's "worldly" advice was quite amusing.
2667	voodooqueen126	2014-05-06	I actually think the Lysa discussion of Catelyn being fat was kind of ridiculous, showing that the writers were unable to imagine a society where thinness was not considered beautiful (hint the preference for thin women is actually incredibly recent).
2668	jons nissa	2014-05-06	Â And I think making her LF's fake niece is less squicky if LF continues to touch Sansa, and less dramatic.
Â I wasn't sure if TV-Sansa was lying when she was babbling about LF thinking her a "stupid little girl", or she really believed it. Â 

Â 
i agree about the niece vs. daughter.
Â 
as for not sure about sansa lying or not, there was a great quote in one of the unsullied thread where they said the scene showed that she had internalized all the hate and ridicule she'd heard in king's landing and that there was no hiding from the torture, not even in your mind.
Â 
another poster said she'd transferred all the stuff joff had been saying to littlefinger and it showed quick thinking.

i thought it was the writers showing how petty and jealous lysa had always been since no one believed the story for a second. having the scene end in her very visible, erratic behavior really supported that lysa is not seeing things clearly.

2669	DaughterOfThe9Moons	2014-05-06	I didn't mind too much that they made Sansa Petyr's niece instead of daughter, it doesn't change much really... but that's the thing. I don't understand why it was necessary. It doesn't make sense that it was done to avoid squicking viewers because the show has never shied away from depicting incest, rape, murder and all sorts of unsavoury things and I am sure that people are perfectly aware that Sansa is not actually Petyr's daughter. I just don't know what the point was. While I am aware that things need to be changed to effectively translate the books into a TV show I disagree with unnecessary changes, especially those that don't affect anything. Daughter to niece? What's the point? Anyway...
Loved this episode, basically I love any episode that is Sansa heavy as her story really intrigues me. I actually thought the Sansa/Lysa interaction was well done and perfectly set the scene for future events. I just wish that Sansa's hair had been coloured before the start of the episode so that she approached the Eyrie as Alayne, I think it would have been much more obvious for the unsullied that Sansa is adopting a new persona.Â

I think that they did it because they weren't sure that some of the viewers wouldn't start thinking that she was really his daughter and that Cat cheated on Ned with LF. Yes, they think that the audience, or parts of it, is just that stupid and/or inattentive. FFS, they thought that people might confuse Asha and Osha because their names are similar, and even that they might confuse Sweetrobin with king Robert if they had the same name!
Â 
I think that this is also the main reason why they aren't dyeing Sansa's hair. Casual vewers who know her as "ginger Stark" could get confused when she has a different hair color.
Â 
To be fair to D&D, their habit of spelling things out for the audience and thinking that the viewers could gt confused about everything probably stems from the reception that their original pilot got at the time (when the Unsullied friends they showed it to didn't even realize Jaime and Cersei were siblings, so they did their best to mention the fact some dozen times in the new versions of the pilot). And maybe they're even somewhat right when it comes to the very casual viewers. Someone recently told a story that their mother confuses Jon Snow with Robb ("didn't he get killed at the wedding?"). And even some books readers have come up with theories like this.

You're probably right about that being the reason to change her to his niece...those theoriesÂ  Â . You'd think the portrayal of Cat/Ned's relationship or her conversations with LF would have turned them off the idea, but what can you do. I still say they could have pulled off the hair dye if it was explicated on screen, but her being in the Eyrie already makes that seem highly unlikely.
Â 
On a different Sansa note, Â anyone see this from 538.com?Â http://fivethirtyeig...ook-characters/
Looks like we'll likely be getting TWOW material in Sansa's arc next year. Especially given the Vale Lords have already been cast for this season.

Interesting table. I have been wondering how they are going to manage Sansa's storyline (along with others) seeing as she has no material in ADwD (don't even get me started on how angry I was after I slogged through that thing and found NO Sansa chapters asdjhasdljgbandfmvdmnfbdfghasd;gfhas;jdghs). It would be great if we got TWOW material because I am dying to hear more but on the other hand, I wouldn't want to spoiler myself before the book comes out. I am not sure what GRRM is going to do if he can't get it out in the next two years.Â

Well, they have to use her TWOW material for season 5 - either that, or make stuff up, and I'd much prefer they did the former. Otherwise there's not much material for her. The most interesting parts of her Feast chapters were her internal thoughts. Take that out, and you're not left with much, and most of it is setup and introductions to various characters in the Vale. I have no doubt that they will at least include the stuff from the chapter that was moved from ADWD. I wonder if GRRM, if he doesn't manage to publish TWOW by that time, will release more chapters just in time before HBO airs the episodes with the spoilery stuff, like he released "Mercy" before episode 4.1 aired?

The could slow it down a bit by using the Sansa/LT dialogues to give some more background for the TV viewer and lay the groundwork for whatever does happen...like I thought it was a nice piece of info. drop to remind the viewers that the Eyrie has never been breached...and I suspect that fact of the Vale's military near invulnerability will play a role in the future.
2676	Newstar	2014-05-06	There was a quote from Alex Graves which seemed to imply the writers wouldn't run out of book until Season 6. I don't recall the exact phrasing, but I read it as meaning that the writers wouldn't run out of book material for another season (not counting the current one), and that Season 6 would herald TWOW material. Personally, I'd been assuming that the end of Season 5 would line up roughly with where AFFC/ADWD ended, although I suppose part of Season 6 could tie up loose ends from those books.
If true--and to be fair, I might have misread it--that's going to make things sticky for Bran and Sansa, who are rapidly running out of book material. Dany has already exhausted her ASOS material, with the exception of Jorah's banishment, and we're only halfway through Season 4 (although Dany has far more chapters in AFFC/ADWD than Sansa or Bran). Brienne's already on the road with Pod. I don't know how they can avoid dipping into TWOW for Bran and Sansa in Season 5, absent filler storylines or paring down their screentime even more.
...Now that I think about it, though, what with the influx of new characters and new plots in Season 5--which will be dramatic even if streamlined from the books--the solution could just be as simple as paring down Sansa's screentime significantly to make room for all the new storylines. That extra time for new plots has to come from somewhere.

I expect there'll be less time for all individual plots next year, but every plot needs a certain number of appearances to even be viable.
Â 
Though I expect the single-biggest source of new screentime is going to be the enormously reduced presence of King's Landing.
2678	Petyr Patter	2014-05-06	I think the writers decided on economy, One line, "this is my niece, Alayne," versus a backstory that keeps on needing explanation.Â  "You are my bastard daughter with a merchant's daughter who gave you to a sept who raises you until your 14th name day and sought me out because this explains why I was never seen with a bastard daughter before."Â 
Â 
On the other hand, I will miss characters constantly calling Sansa bastard a la Jon Snow.
Â 
The only real difference I see is a lack of creepiness when Littlefinger demands kisses from his daughter.Â  On other hand, "creepy uncle" is a pretty well known thing.

Â 
All they needed to do was add one more word to that sentence, "Stone," and I think we'd be happy. I'm assuming it's going to come up later though.

You're right that I'm sure we're going to be seeing less of Sansa. But even so I think we may need a bit of TWOW material. Her last chapter in AFFC is an okayish place to leave her storyline, but not really such a fantastic cliffhanger that they're going to make sure they won't dip into anything else.
2680	Newstar	2014-05-06	Sansa has four chapters of published book left, I think, and we know at least one of them will be shown this season (snow scene/Only Cat), along with some fillery stuff introducing Anya Waynwood and Bronze Yohn Royce. That leaves three book chapters, and three...set pieces, I guess you could say: Sansa and LF framing the show version of Marillion, the meeting with the lords, and the descent from the Eyrie. That's not a lot in show time and would probably be covered in one episode apiece. although I suppose the rest could be covered by LF giving speeches or Vale worldbuilding.

It's a bit of a shame; because LF's casting Sansa as his daughter really resonates with his fantasy past relationship with Sansa's mother; and I think that on one level, book-LF really does envision Sansa as the daughter that he and Cat were supposed to have, but his imagining of her as a pliable and even more beautiful Cat Mark II keeps intruding into the father-daughter relationship. Â It's more dramatic, if more icky-squicky, and more psychologically interesting.
Â 
But then this Littlefinger is apparently alright with entrusting a possibly mentally unstable child with the explosive information of Alayne's true identity, bringing three crates of lemons from King's Landing (an order which could be traced by Cersei or her agents, and Sansa Stark is known to be fond of lemoncakes), and letting a tall, beautiful young redhead be seen by half the Eyrie guards before telling her to cover up...he's not as bright as book-LF. Â (not to mention the infamous Season 1 Reveal of LF's innermost thoughts and motivations to two of his prostitutes) Â I can't believe that no one's going to pipe up and say "I didn't know you had a brother or sister" to LF.

I was thinking the same thing. It didn't ring true to the intelligent Littlefinger character that has been developed. Anyone investigating Sansa's part in Joffrey's murder would surely consider that someone with resources has helped her escape. They would also be aware that Sansa has a relative living in the Eyrie, and Lord Baelish is betrothed to this person. You would then have to assume that enquiries would be made if Littlefinger arrived at the Eyrie with a statuesque redhead.
Don't get me started on the Jon Arryn murder reveal! The horrible, clunky, expositional monologue for such a huge twist was just awful.

In that respect, he's not actually that different from the book version.Â  Sansa dyeing her hair was Lysa's idea, and it only happened after she had presumably been seen by the knights and ladies Lysa brought with her to the Fingers (one of the little oddities of the books, honestly).
Â

That's not a lot in show time and would probably be covered in one episode apiece. although I suppose the rest could be covered by LF giving speeches or Vale worldbuilding.


If they're sticking to just AFFC next season, I think the material there could be made to work for 5-6ish appearances of varying size, which generally seems to be how much space they prefer a given plot to have.Â  A lot depends on what they play to keep, of course.Â  For instance, Sansa's final chapter could be spread over two episodes (the descent, and then the meeting with Littlefinger), depending on whether the stuff that happens in the descent (getting to know either Mya or Myranda) is judged to be important.Â  I expect that the lords laying siege to the Eyrie would be brought up at least once before the actual meeting.
Â 
Most of these would not be big scenes, but enough to keep the plotline "in play" over the season.
Â 
But then, one of the things that makes judging how anything will be adapted next year (including what characters will be introduced) is that we no longer have much sense of what's to come afterward, so any assessments of a character's long-term relevance are basically guesswork.Â  Like, if Sansa ends up having to flee Littlefinger and trek through the mountains, I would imagine Mya is an important character.

The hair bothers me, I didn't remember that anyone saw her as a red head but Lysa in the books except for LFs people at the Fingers, and presumably, he can trust them.

Good point. That's why it's going to be very interesting to see who gets cast for Season 5, in general as well as in Sansa's storyline. They're going to have to cut a lot out of AFFC and ADWD to make it suitable for adaptation--let alone adaptation in one season (minus the Season 4 stuff) which is how the wind seems to be blowing--so it will be very interesting to see who's deemed essential (Quentyn? Mya Stone? Aegon? Victarion? Myranda Royce? Nestor Royce?) and who's deemed expendable.
I don't mind pulling the trigger on the Lysa reveal in the show. I hated the way it was done in the books.

Right after Daennerys speaks of "Viserion and Rhaegal" and everyone says "Wait, who?" 
Â 
As for Sansa, we don't even know if there is a descend from the Eyre, as the ascend was cut and the castle wasn't shown. Nestor Royce hasn't been cast either and there is the question of who's taking the blame for Lysa's death.
Â 
And since Lysa seems to fall in episode seven, and there is no Nestor Royce to bring to LF's side (or at least in appearances) we may end the season with the Lords Declarants. Since there might not be a descend from the Eyre (and no Mya  ), that leaves about half a chapter of Sansa's AFFC material. Namely, Sansa expending some time in the Eyre without Baelish around and his return with the HtH betrothal. If the last episode includes Sansa, I wonder if something about the title might also reference something regarding Robin.
Â 
But, in short, IMHO they have published material for one or two chapters next season.
Â 
I also wonder how Sansa and Arya near miss will play. Will Sansa be able to see her from afar, but be unable to assist her in any way? Would LF's possible lie about knowing about Arya's stubborn survival in S3 have an impact this season?
2687	Colonel Green	2014-05-06	As for Sansa, we don't even know if there is a descend from the Eyre, as the ascend was cut and the castle wasn't shown.


If they were staying in the Eyrie full-time I can't imagine they would have torn the high hall down after this season's filming.Â  That suggests they know they won't be setting all that many more scenes there.
Â 

If the last episode includes Sansa, I wonder if something about the title might also reference something regarding Robin.

No way she's not in the finale.Â  All plotlines get something there (and if "only Cat" really is in episode 7, that would pretty much have to be where the lords show up).

2688	Alayne's Shadow.	2014-05-06	I'm not sure I can call what happened this episode the birth of Alayne, considering they barely made any changes to fit her character. I'm still holding out hope that Sansa dyes her hair, but that's highly unlikely. I still hope LF explains to Sansa who Alayne is, if she is a Stone. That'sÂ  sorely missing from the show.
2689	DaughterOfThe9Moons	2014-05-06	[snip]... and there is the question of who's taking the blame for Lysa's death.


Â 
Good point. As I recall Marillion played a significant part in a lot of the storyline at the Eyrie. Does anyone know whether or not there is even going to be a Marillion in the show? I was very surprised that he was not introduced this ep. and that the opportunity for Sansa to be sexually threatened was missed. I would have thought that scene would have made it on screen for sure. Perhaps they're saving it for future episodes to fill in time? If there isn't going to be a Marillion does anyone have any theories on how they're going to play this out without him?Â 
I think they are going to stretch out the remainder of Sansa's chapters throughout each episode of the 4th season but I really don't know how they're going to manage next season without drawing heavily from TWOW, fabricating storylines for her completely or keeping her in stasis in the Vale and giving her very little screentime. I am very interested to see which option they decide to go with.
2690	Colonel Green	2014-05-06	In terms of a Marillion replacement, they may just go with "random guard".
2691	DaveyJoe	2014-05-06	Marillion was in the show, he traveled with Cat and Tyrion to the Eyrie, then made it to King's Landing where Joffrey had his tongue removed for singing a song poking fun at Robert and Cersei. Â For the Lysa scapegoat they could use Mord, the turnkey from season 1 maybe?
2692	WTFSalami	2014-05-06	Alayne not being a Stone is more D&D-level character-white-washi-nation


Yep. Those two are pure evil personified. They've probably killed real people. Stone was SO VITAL MAN to Sansa's arc.Â 
Â 
Â 
Y U HATE ERRBODY DUNGEONS&DRAGONS????
2693	Rapsie	2014-05-07	They do seem to like rushing through Sansa's story so Marillion may just become a random guard, which unfortunately affects her character: letting a random guy rather than someone who tried to rape you take the fall for Lysa's death will seem a lot darker to viewers.
In the unsullied threads on Previously TV there seems to be a lot of incredulity about Ser Dontos and the necklace plot and this mainly stems from it being so rushed and changes to the plot. There had been no arranged escape, which could have provided a plausible excuse for her having to wear the necklace (if they didn't want to go with magic, they could have changed it to, wear this and we will sell it later or some such excuse).  Also the way D&D had the dwarf act insult everyone was good TV but the dwarf act in the book was specifically set up by LF, because he knew there would be a scene between Joff and Tyrion because it would prick Tyrion's pride. It was a set-up that now doesn't work as everyone was offended and because of the St Tyrion monster, that part of his character is no longer shown. 
Sadly Sansa's storyline seems to be one they just do not want to do I depth. I suspect season 5 may involve a lot of filler.

Any random guard who was on hand to be blamed for it would, one imagines, be participating in Lysa's attempted murder, so I think that would probably suffice.

If he's cast though, I imagine they'll also cast Mya to perhaps teach Sansa some useful 'tricks'. *Shrugs* All speculation. But in any event, the future casting of people will prove insightful. I completely agree with this idea. I think the knowledge that D&D knows how it ends just makes me look at every little detail differently, or at the very least, suspiciously (or maybe 'curiously' is a better word). Why did they reveal Jon Arryn now instead of in the Snow Castle/Only Cat sequence? Why hasn't Marrilion (or a replacement) shown up yet (I would have thought that would have happened last episode)? Where is Mya and Lothar Brune for that matter? Why did they throw away the necklace? What's with the, "Not a killer...yet,"? And why is she still wearing the ring? Every little change makes me feel like it has some significant importance to future Sansa and her story...and not simply because D&D hate the book readers and want to ruin everyone's lives.  Now, I could ultimately be wrong about that, but it makes her scenes even more exciting to me.
Â 


Â 
Good point. As I recall Marillion played a significant part in a lot of the storyline at the Eyrie. Does anyone know whether or not there is even going to be a Marillion in the show? I was very surprised that he was not introduced this ep. and that the opportunity for Sansa to be sexually threatened was missed. I would have thought that scene would have made it on screen for sure. Perhaps they're saving it for future episodes to fill in time? If there isn't going to be a Marillion does anyone have any theories on how they're going to play this out without him?Â 
I think they are going to stretch out the remainder of Sansa's chapters throughout each episode of the 4th season but I really don't know how they're going to manage next season without drawing heavily from TWOW, fabricating storylines for her completely or keeping her in stasis in the Vale and giving her very little screentime. I am very interested to see which option they decide to go with.


Â 
The lack of Marillion thing has me secretly horrified for how Snow Castle/Only Cat will play out later. I dare not even speak about how I'm imagining it'll play out, but oy. Let's hope they introduce a patsy and soon!
Â 
In other news, I'm of the opinion that they'll move in TWOW for Sansa's story next season. I think her story has become quite intriguing to viewers (at least, with the ones I know. For example, my girl Melissa can't STAND Sansa, and even SHE'S completely turned on to Sansa's story now. She text me earlier in a hot mess about the possibility of anyone hurting Sansa. I had an ear to ear grin about that one, let me tell you  ) and they'll want to see how it plays out for her. As a side note (and serious question)...how would we know whether or not her scenes next season are 'filler' or actual WOW material? Aside from chapters that are already known in a AFFC...anything beyond that or in addition to them could very well be from TWOW. How would we know any better?
2696	Colonel Green	2014-05-07	Where is Mya and Lothar Brune for that matter?


Whether or not Mya is introduced, I wouldn't have expected to see her now.Â  The show only introduces characters when they become relevant to the plot (the Tullys and the Reeds, for instance); in Mya's case I wouldn't expect her to appear earlier than the time around the descent from the Eyrie (whether that happens in the show or not).
Â 
Same with Brune.Â  There's a bunch of guards at the Eyrie.Â  If he's important, he can pop up at any time in the future.

Same with Brune, really.Â  There's a bunch of guards at the Eyrie.Â  If he's important, he can pop up at any time in the future.


Â 
Very true. You're right. See, I keep thinking Brune is important if only to save Sansa from being raped, but since there was no rape attempt, there's no reason for him to be there (yet).
2698	Rapsie	2014-05-07	Any random guard who was on hand to be blamed for it would, one imagines, be participating in Lysa's attempted murder, so I think that would probably suffice.

It will suffice, but it's still a hell of a lot less darker if it's someone she has had contact with before, than random henchman 1. Especially if they add the guard having been tortured next season.
2699	DaughterOfThe9Moons	2014-05-07	Â 



Marillion was in the show, he traveled with Cat and Tyrion to the Eyrie, then made it to King's Landing where Joffrey had his tongue removed for singing a song poking fun at Robert and Cersei. Â For the Lysa scapegoat they could use Mord, the turnkey from season 1 maybe?



Oh that's right! I had forgotten about that. Seems kind of strange that they didn't keep Marillion around considering that they must have been aware his character would make a future reappearance and end up being an important part of the plot. I don't know why it was necessary to have his tongue removed, they could have had Joff do that to any old mummer (as in the books) and it would have sufficed. Replacing Marillion with a nobody in the Eyrie doesn't make sense to me. As others have said, it makes Sansa's complicity in allowing him to take the fall for Lysa's death that much darker.
Â 


They do seem to like rushing through Sansa's story so Marillion may just become a random guard, which unfortunately affects her character: letting a random guy rather than someone who tried to rape you take the fall for Lysa's death will seem a lot darker to viewers.
In the unsullied threads on Previously TV there seems to be a lot of incredulity about Ser Dontos and the necklace plot and this mainly stems from it being so rushed and changes to the plot. There had been no arranged escape, which could have provided a plausible excuse for her having to wear the necklace (if they didn't want to go with magic, they could have changed it to, wear this and we will sell it later or some such excuse). Also the way D&D had the dwarf act insult everyone was good TV but the dwarf act in the book was specifically set up by LF, because he knew there would be a scene between Joff and Tyrion because it would prick Tyrion's pride. It was a set-up that now doesn't work as everyone was offended and because of the St Tyrion monster, that part of his character is no longer shown.
Sadly Sansa's storyline seems to be one they just do not want to do I depth. I suspect season 5 may involve a lot of filler.


Â 
I agree that her story has been rushed. I understand that it's impossible to fit in every little detail but I do think that not setting up the escape was strange. It wouldn't have taken much, perhaps one scene, to establish it and it would have made the ensuing events much more comprehensible though no less shocking.
Â 


Â

Â 
Now that the show is catching up to the books I too am growing increasingly suspicious and reading (perhaps too much) into the choices they have made in the way they portray events in the show. I can't wait to see exactly who is cast in case it sheds any light on the storyline but at the same time it's driving me crazy having to interpret every detail.

I was just reading this topic (beware, GOT S04E01 & TWOW chapter spoilers and discussion) which theorises that TWOW material has already been incorporated in the show this season and has been taken from the TWOW chapters that have been released. It seems like a legitimate heory/observation to me which makes me wonder whether GRRM will be releasing a Sansa chapter before the release of the next season in order for there to be some material for the show to exploit. If this doesn't happen then we have no way of knowing without any input from D&D or GRRM ... which would drive me mental.

Â 
I hope we get a Sansa chapter, but I don't think it has to be released for D&D to use it.

	Spoiler 
They clearly had the Mercy chapter long before GRRM posted it on his website; because they had to have scripted that months before. So I'm sure he's passing on completed chapters to them. However, this does bode well for us, because if they do dip into TWOW so explicitly (like verbatim dialogue), and GRRM is willing to release a chapter ahead of time to prepare us for it, then he might be willing to do the same with other sample chapters (potentially a Sansa one).
Â 
It also bodes well for anyone who is concerned that D&D don't know what they're doing when they're "off-book." I think they're more on-book than we realize.
2702	DaveyJoe	2014-05-07	Â 
I was thinking about the casting of Harry. Surmised that if they didn't cast him, then Littlefinger's 'plot' was a red herring and not ultimately important.Â 


Â 
That would be right in line with the other times a character explained their grand plan in the series.
2703	Newstar	2014-05-07	I hope we get a Sansa chapter, but I don't think it has to be released for D&D to use it.
Â 
Me, neither.
Â 

	Spoiler D&D must have seen the Mercy chapter by the spring of 2013, when they were writing Season 4. I guess you could say that GRRM just told them during their meeting early in 2013 with him what happens in that chapter, but the dialogue seems too specific for that. And if he's shown them the Mercy chapter, it's probably a safe bet that he's shown them other chapters as well.
Â 
I think D&D got a draft of ADWD as well in advance of its publication..although of course GRRM's probably far off from being ready to provide them with a written draft. He could very well be feeding D&D chapters as he goes. Since the Sansa chapter in question was bumped from ADWD, just like the Arya chapter, I would be shocked if D&D hadn't seen it.

Â 
...This is all academic, though, since GRRM has spoiled D&D extensively on future plots for every character. Even if they haven't seen TWOW Sansa chapters yet, they must have a pretty good idea of what goes on in them.
Â 
It's hard for me to get upset about the idea of writers unintentionally forcing GRRM's hand by incorporating TWOW material into the show, because hey, at least someone is.
Â 

	Spoiler I do kind of wonder how they're going to deal with the Mercy chapter, since Arya's running out of names on her list and Raff isn't on her TV list. Is Ser Meryn going to make a side trip to Braavos?

Â 
I'll be paying close attention to the way Sansa's arc is written for the remainder of Season 4 and for Season 5 (assuming TWOW isn't released by the time Season 5 airs), as we're likely to get a whiff of what that potentially "controversial" Sansa chapter entails--assuming the "controversy" is something significant, which is not a given, of course--a chapter I wouldn't be surprised D&D have seen (or at least know what goes on in it, as they've been briefed by GRRM as to future arcs in detail).
Â 
...Or Season 5 could get into TWOW territory for Sansa's arc, full stop. I doubt it, personally, as I think the end point goal for D&D in Season 5 will be to get everything aligned again for the AFFC/ADWD stopping points for each character, and the Sansa AFFC plot ends with a decent cliffhanger (LF's master plan).

Â 
Yeah, it's not a bad place to leave off for her, but that would mean we see very, very little of her next season. Or we get into some heavy Vale politics, which sounds unlikely to me. I wonder if Harry the Heir will be cast for next season?
Â 
Agreed though, I think from here on out, how the show writes arcs and what they choose to say is very, very indicative of what's to come in the books. Interesting that even when they're not explicitly spoiling something, there's shades of spoilers to be found. Then again this is hardly new; back in Season 1, Â Episode 2 when Ned says goodbye to Jon his "I promise line" was almost confirmation of R+L=J.

Â 
R+L=J is pretty small potatoes in the spoiler department, at least for seasoned book fans. Alfie Allen all but spoiled it in an interview.
Â 
It is true that D&D have known how the books end from the get-go, but it seems to have been only in the broadest possible sense, since they had to go back to GRRM in 2013 and, in their words, go character by character as to where their future arcs would take them and where they would end up, something that wouldn't have been necessary if they had been spoiled extensively from Day 1. (It seems to have been D&D getting a little insurance in case GRRM is unable to finish the books, a wise decision if you ask me.) That's why I'm way more interested in things written after that meeting than before, and why I'll be very interested to see what gets cut and what doesn't from adapting AFFC/ADWD.

2707	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-07	Niece vs Daugter
I cannot for the life of me understand why this is a problem. It just doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t matter. It just seems like more whinging for the sake of it.
BFF with Tyrion
In the book, this is not the case... In the show, which is not the book, this is the case. I got over this long ago. I used to whinge about Sansa bending her knees to marry Tyrion because it didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t happen in the book. I read thousands of posts saying the same thing though and I just thought â<U+0080>Ugh, do I sound like that when I complain about the changes?â<U+0080><U+0099> and the answer was â<U+0080>Yes I do and I must change this immediatlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>. Tyrion in the show is not Tyrion in the book. Again, this was easy to get over. If I want to experience book Tyrion, I read the books. If I want to experience show Tyrion, I watch the show. They are separate entities and separate canon. Its not a big deal, really.
Early Jon Arryn reveal
I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t understand the fuss over this. What difference does it make? TBH, is it not a massive plot hole in the novels that Sansa knows Littlefinger caused the whole WOTFK which resulted in the annihilation of her family? In the show, she doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know this info. Lysa said it â<U+0080>earlyâ<U+0080><U+0099> compared to the books but really, it doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t matter. More pointeless whinging IMO.
Sweet Robin knowing
Hmmm... Yeah fair enough, book Littlefinger obviously would not allow this. TV Littlefinger clearly does though, maybe hes an idiot? Maybe hes gonna kill SR soon anyway.
Bloody Gate
Why doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t anyone ride horses? How far did they walk to get there? Minor problem, doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t spoil anything though.
I think everyone nitpicks and whinges over the slightest little thing.

Do you ever do anything on this board besides sarcastically mock any and all criticisms people have of the show? Maybe you should go to another board if thats all youre ever going to do.Â 

Nah I write loads of things. I have also found a few book series I love through this site and obviously when I first started lurking after finishing the novels... My mind was blown. R+L=J? Mind blowing at the time. GNR? Makes so much sense. Etc. 
I have wrote plenty of things that I think about the novels and tv show tbh. You jst cherry picked 1 post, although I admit I wrote something similar in another thread. 
I just find the over exaggerated whinging about everything a little tiresome. 
Don't get me wrong, I think the show could be much better than it is, but it isn't and I don't think crying about being a niece instead of a daughter is gonna change anything. 
The show has a lot of fan service for novel fans in it as well which I think is nice. 
People need to remember, this isn't being made for book readers. It's being brought to the masses. Masses who usually don't read high fantasy and probably mock it by and large. It's amazing the show exists at all.
2709	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-07	I agree that her story has been rushed. I understand that it's impossible to fit in every little detail but I do think that not setting up the escape was strange.

Â 


Â 
See, I'm thinking we're going to be proven correct in our suspicions and over-analysis of every little detail, and here's why; Let's start with the premise that 7 seasons is indeed the endgame. That's 30 episodes. They have 30 episodes to wrap up 20+ character's storylines (excluding any new characters that might come along). Tack on to that fact that within those 30 episodes they have to deal with some pretty heavy Mega-Events (Winter finally coming, the White Walkers, the resolution to the wars in Westeros, who sits on the Iron Throne, etc)...and in the "Economy of Time" D&D have no more money to spare. They're going to get things moving and quickly. So, yeah, I think every detail probably means something now. Wait, let me qualify that statement....the 'majority' of every detail probably means something now. So, yeah, I don't think we're being paranoid at all.
Â 
Also, perhaps they're rushing Sansa's story because she matters in very important ways later on, and the sooner they get to THAT, the better. I mean, we can freak out about rushing her story, but maybe its actually a GOOD thing its going by quickly. *Shrugs*
2710	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-07	Fair enough but that's pure speculation on your part in terms of up coming spoilers. 
I understand that yeah, maybe they are spoilers. But how do we know until TWOW is out? 
I think this season seems to be fast paced because it's based on the end of ASOS rather than starting at the beginning.
2711	Annara Snow	2014-05-07	It will suffice, but it's still a hell of a lot less darker if it's someone she has had contact with before, than random henchman 1. Especially if they add the guard having been tortured next season.


Â 
Not if it's someone who was complicit in Lysa's attempted murder of Sansa (as Marillion also was)/trying to murder her on Lysa's orders.
Â 
The latter would be a good way to go about it for another reason. In the book, Sansa couldn't fight off Lysa because Lysa was so much heavier than her. Kate Dickie is skinny and doesn't look like she could physically overcome Sophie Turner and push her out of the moon door.
Â 
Someone on another thread suggested that Mord could restrain her and try to push her on Lysa's orders, which I think is a pretty good idea. That way you'd get a character that people already know and who's already known as brutal (plus not smart enough to come up with any defense).
Â 


Â 
Â 

Oh that's right! I had forgotten about that. Seems kind of strange that they didn't keep Marillion around considering that they must have been aware his character would make a future reappearance and end up being an important part of the plot. I don't know why it was necessary to have his tongue removed, they could have had Joff do that to any old mummer (as in the books) and it would have sufficed.
Â 



Â 
They supposedly thought that the audience would care more if it's a character they know, which I think is pretty stupid, since I doubt that the audience cared much about Marillion in the the first place. More importantly, it defied logic - why would Marillion make an effort to take a ship (or that transporter that LF uses) just to go to King's Landing in time to start singing songs about the late king Robert and Cersei? Not to mention that he wasn't portrayed s a very brave individual in the first place.
Â 
However, his role in ASOS really isn't contingent on him being Marillion. If they had wanted, they could have cast someone as another singer and have him play the exact same role, being rapist and Lysa's favorite and all - it's a nice little bit of continuity in the books, but book 1 didn't even establish Marillion as a rapist, we didn't even know the part of his characterization that would become relevant in book 1.
Â 
Â 


Â 
Now that the show is catching up to the books I too am growing increasingly suspicious and reading (perhaps too much) into the choices they have made in the way they portray events in the show. I can't wait to see exactly who is cast in case it sheds any light on the storyline but at the same time it's driving me crazy having to interpret every detail.
Â 

There's a danger of overthinking things there. Look at how they did things in the first three seasons that related to storylines whose development and outcome they already knew and characters whose demise was already known, because it was in the published books. Why did they invent the scenes between Arya and Tywin? Why did they remove Roose Bolton from the Harrenhal storyline and downplay his importance? Why didn't they cast Ramsey in season 2? Imagine that A Storm of Swords hadn't been published before season 2 aired and you had used the same method of reading D&D's knowledge about the series into every detail and book-to-show change. You might have concluded that Roose and Ramsey were not going to be important characters in the series and that the Arya/Tywin relationship was going to be really important going forward. All of those changes defied and continue to defy logic if you look at it from this perspective (and the lack of Ramsey in season 2 lead to not showing the sack of Winterfell and really hurt the TV presentation of that storyline), and as we know, it had nothing to do with what D&D knew about the storyline, they were done because 1) they wanted to give Charles Dance more screentime, 2) they thought it was cool if Arya and Tywin had scenes together, 3) they didn't want to cast another major cast member for season 2, and 4) they don't particularly care about foreshadowing things (even when it comes to the event they said was the reason they wanted to adapt the series in the first place, the RW) and prefer to have big shocking twists.

or Alex Graves decided to just show up during episode 7 filming.Â 
Â 
ETA: Never mind. That shot doesnt necessarily mean it's the Only Cat scene.Â

2719	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-07	My unsullied friend made a cool observation that i didnt really think about.Â 
He said that Sansa was pretty great in defusing Lysa in the dinner scene. About how she went on and on about how LF thinks her "a stupid little girl with stupid ideas and stupid dreams etc" and LF never said that. Ever. LF said "Everyone here (KL) are liars and every one is better than you." So Sansa's blurting that out is really her own invention and likely how she feels about herself at the moment.Â 
Â 
One of those little things that unsullied pick up on and remind me why i like TV Sansa so much.
2720	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-07	Funny thing is that Lysa told her she mustn't call her "aunt Lysa" before anybody else, but with Alayne being LFs niece Lysa is actually her aunt by marriage.exactly what I was thinking...

She thinks that about herself in the books as well. Several times, once she takes the Alayne persona, thinks of Sansa as "that stupid little girl"
Â 
As for her season 5 arc, I think it depends on how and when her TWOW arc will intersect the other arcs. Her story can advance until the point she needs other characters outside the Vale (for instance, Rickon) to catch up with her.

No, not really. The only time in the Vale when she thinks of herself, or her former self, as a silly/stupid little girl, is when she's thinking about the time when she was crushing on Waymar Royce - which was back in Winterfell when she was no more than 10 or 11, before the start of the series, before she went to King's Landing and had all the horrible life changing experiences. That's not very different from the way she thought of her former self early in ASOS, when she felt she was different from Margaery's cousins, who were happy, giggly and talking about how handsome Joffrey is and what it would be like to kiss a king, and Sansa was thinking that they reminded her of what she used to be like once, before she saw her father beheaded.
The idea that she thinks of "Sansa" in general as a stupid little girl seems to come from the popular fanon that Sansa was "stupid" until LF took her out of KL and she magically transformed into someone else, by readers who didn't notice that she had a logical character growth during her time in KL, since GRRM writes gradual character development rather than 180 turns.
She thinks that Sansa was scared while Alayne is "bastard brave", not that she was stupid.

actually she said it several times to joffrey so i think she's learned that when she has people think she's stupid, they leave her alone. there was also an unsullied comment that she heard it so much she has internalized it and is therefore still being tortured.

There is also this
Â 
Once, when she was just a little girl, a wandering singer had stayed with them at Winterfell for half a year. An old man he was, with white hair and windburnt cheeks, but he sang of knights and quests and ladies fair, and Sansa had cried bitter tears when he left them, and begged her father not to let him go. â<U+0080><U+009C>The man has played us every song he knows thrice over,â<U+0080><U+009D> Lord Eddard told her gently. â<U+0080><U+009C>I cannot keep him here against his will. You need not weep, though. I promise you, other singers will come.â<U+0080><U+009D>
They hadnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t, though, not for a year or more. Sansa had prayed to the Seven in their sept and old gods of the heart tree, asking them to bring the old man back, or better still to send another singer, young and handsome. But the gods never answered, and the halls of Winterfell stayed silent.But that was when she was a little girl, and foolish.
Â 
And this

2730	DaughterOfThe9Moons	2014-05-07	Â 
I hope we get a Sansa chapter, but I don't think it has to be released for D&D to use it.

	Spoiler 
They clearly had the Mercy chapter long before GRRM posted it on his website; because they had to have scripted that months before. So I'm sure he's passing on completed chapters to them. However, this does bode well for us, because if they do dip into TWOW so explicitly (like verbatim dialogue), and GRRM is willing to release a chapter ahead of time to prepare us for it, then he might be willing to do the same with other sample chapters (potentially a Sansa one).
Â 
It also bodes well for anyone who is concerned that D&D don't know what they're doing when they're "off-book." I think they're more on-book than we realize. 



Â It doesn't have to be released for D&D to use it but from what I understand GRRM wants to release his version of the story before the show depicts theirs which is why I think it likely that if TWOW material will be used in Sansa's story line in season 5, a preview chapter may be released to coincide with the season premier.Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
See, I'm thinking we're going to be proven correct in our suspicions and over-analysis of every little detail, and here's why; Let's start with the premise that 7 seasons is indeed the endgame. That's 30 episodes. They have 30 episodes to wrap up 20+ character's storylines (excluding any new characters that might come along). Tack on to that fact that within those 30 episodes they have to deal with some pretty heavy Mega-Events (Winter finally coming, the White Walkers, the resolution to the wars in Westeros, who sits on the Iron Throne, etc)...and in the "Economy of Time" D&D have no more money to spare. They're going to get things moving and quickly. So, yeah, I think every detail probably means something now. Wait, let me qualify that statement....the 'majority' of every detail probably means something now. So, yeah, I don't think we're being paranoid at all.
Â 
Also, perhaps they're rushing Sansa's story because she matters in very important ways later on, and the sooner they get to THAT, the better. I mean, we can freak out about rushing her story, but maybe its actually a GOOD thing its going by quickly. *Shrugs*


Â I agree. I believe the show will run for a maximum of 7 seasons and that D&D have the general outline set out already. They're more than half way through the series and if they didn't have the majority of the story finalised by now they would be facing serious pacing problems. As the series continues, with the amount of story that they have to get through to bring everything to the conclusion they're going to have to be extremely selective about what makes the cut and what doesn't and their choices are going to be very telling.
Â 
Â 


Â 

There's a danger of overthinking things there. Look at how they did things in the first three seasons that related to storylines whose development and outcome they already knew and characters whose demise was already known, because it was in the published books. Why did they invent the scenes between Arya and Tywin? Why did they remove Roose Bolton from the Harrenhal storyline and downplay his importance? Why didn't they cast Ramsey in season 2? Imagine that A Storm of Swords hadn't been published before season 2 aired and you had used the same method of reading D&D's knowledge about the series into every detail and book-to-show change. You might have concluded that Roose and Ramsey were not going to be important characters in the series and that the Arya/Tywin relationship was going to be really important going forward. All of those changes defied and continue to defy logic if you look at it from this perspective (and the lack of Ramsey in season 2 lead to not showing the sack of Winterfell and really hurt the TV presentation of that storyline), and as we know, it had nothing to do with what D&D knew about the storyline, they were done because 1) they wanted to give Charles Dance more screentime, 2) they thought it was cool if Arya and Tywin had scenes together, 3) they didn't want to cast another major cast member for season 2, and 4) they don't particularly care about foreshadowing things (even when it comes to the event they said was the reason they wanted to adapt the series in the first place, the RW) and prefer to have big shocking twists.

Â 


That is also true. I probably would have theorised that Ros would become the future queen of Westeros based on the amount of screen time she got in the first couple of seasons. I mean, it is a dangerous game but I do feel that as the ending draws nearer there is less room for extraneous story lines. IMO they're going to have to keep everything pretty tight from now on if they want to draw the series to a comprehensible and satisfying conclusion.

I also thought Sophie Turner was taller than Kate Dickie, but I'm not so sure now. Hmm...well, the element of surprise could count for a lot.
Â 


Â 
Well, according to this, Kate Dickie (174 cm) is almost as tall as Sophie Turner (175 cm). She's definitely taller than book!Lysa, who was significantly shorter than Sansa. However, she had big weight advantage, which show!Lysa definitely doesn't have. Although crazy people in a fit of rage can be surprisingly strong... But you'd expect the same - at the very least - from someone fighting for their life.

Â 
Very succinct way of putting it. *Thumbs up* I think that after this season, though, if they're working toward the end, they need to come out and say it. I kind of don't want to go through a whole other season of 'nitpicking' over this and that and why they didn't included x-person, y-dialogue, z-event. Like, just come out and say, "We're beginning with the end in mind now," and if people don't like it, they can either stop watching and wait for the books, or prepare themselves to be "spoiled". Or better yet, just start hammering home that the show is the show and the books are the books, and while the two may end in the same place, the road to getting there will be some what distinct.Â 
Â 
As a side note, I don't understand this angst about the show passing the books anyways. Its kind of inevitable now, and its not as if people aren't going to read the books just because the show "spoiled" things. I'm in agreement with a YouTube reviewer (comicbookgirl19) who basically said, "Let the show do its own thing and finish how it wants to finish, and that way GRRM has all the time and space in the world to finish a product he can be proud of without feeling rushed to do so." Definitely NOT an exact quote, but its the general sentiment. I agree with that sentiment. Let the show finish how it finishes and let GRRM produce a quality of work he can be proud of in the time he needs to do it.Â
2733	juanml82	2014-05-07	Â

Â 
No, you added an instance of Sansa thinking of 10/11-year old Sansa in Winterfell, pre-KL, a foolish little girl - so, exactly what I said. She never thinks as "Alayne" that "Sansa" was a stupid girl in general, or that she was stupid when she was in King's Landing as a hostage - she thinks she was frightened.

And you think she thinks she stopped being foolish when she developed a crush on Joffrey? That she wasn't foolish at Darry, for instance?
Â 
Listen, we are both stubborn, but I think we can agree that one of the few issues in which Sansa shows some self-reflection is about her overall dreamy and naive behaviour from early in the series. And remember, she was still thinking in true knights during the Battle of Blackwater, even if the words "sounded hollow" or however it was actually phrased, so it's not like she wised up the moment Joffrey showed her Ned's face.
This is reflected in the show. And, with Sophie's performance, it actually shows, if someone cares to see, how it should hurt for the character to think in that way. The good thing is that only by recognizing mistakes can people learn of them.

Geez, do you even read my post before you reply to them? I said that she refers to her former self, her 10-11 year old self from Winterfell, as a foolish little girl, in her AFFC chapters. And I also said that it's no different from Sansa in early ASOS thinking about her former self (the one who was crushing on Joffrey, before she saw her father beheaded) as a naive little girl, similar to Marg's cousins who were going on about how handsome Joffrey was and what it would be like to kiss a king. And I also said that Sansa has had a steady character development, with the crucial moment being Ned's death. And I said that Sansa doesn't think that she was stupid when she was a hostage in King's Landing, but frightened. It really wasn't difficult to figure out what is generally the logical conclusion, anyway, that I was talking about a naive and sheltered Sansa who was still the same naive Sansa when she was crushing on Joffrey - in Winterfell, on the Kingsroad and for a time in KL (exactly because she was a naive and sheltered girl) - the Sansa who had a crush on good-looking highborn guys she didn't even know like Waymar Royce or Joffrey, and had a completely unrealistic view of life; as opposed to the disillusioned Sansa, who spent a year and a half (or whatever it was) as a frightened hostage in KL.
Â 
And she was silly and foolish because she was thinking about the concept of true knights during Blackwater? Really? So Arya was also silly and foolish when she thought in Harrenhal that Gregor's men were not behaving like knights are supposed to? Or when she thought Dareon deserved to die because he was breaking his NW vows and being a douche? So Brienne is generally silly and foolish? Dunk was silly and foolish, and so was Baelor Breakspear? Barristan is always silly and foolish? Jaime became silly and foolish when he decided that he needed to save Sansa because of his "honor"? Cat was silly and foolish when she accused him of having no honor? Jon is silly and foolish because he takes his vows seriously? Everyone who is not 100% cynical and doesn't see the world like Littlefinger is silly and foolish?

It was after Kingsguards beat her repeatedly, so yes.
Â

Yes
Â

Â 
I'm not sure if silly is the word. "Evil" and all the associated slang seem to fit better.

Â 

So Brienne is generally silly and foolish?
Â 
Â 

Certainly.
Â 
Dunk was silly and foolish,
Â 

When he saved Tanselle? He probably wasn't thinking (with his head), so you could say so

Â 

and so was Baelor Breakspear?
Â 
Â 

Maybe, maybe not. Baelor Breakspear used to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And you can be the "soul of chivalry" because you're a fool, or because, in a proper Machiavellian way, you understand it's a very useful to tool to rule (but it can't be employed at all times)
Â 

Barristan is always silly and foolish?

Well, we have access to his thoughts and see his actions, so I'd say yes. And a bit craven as well.
Â 

Jaime became silly and foolish when he decided that he needed to save Sansa because of his "honor"?

Self-esteem and all that. Probably not. And it wasn't probably because of his honor, but because of his image of himself. Of course, he was foolish if he thought that Brienne would succed by riding through the Riverlands asking for her relative.
Â 
Cat was silly and foolish when she accused him of having no honor?
Â 

Well, no. Jaime has no honor. She was silly and foolish when she released him, though.
Â 
Jon is silly and foolish because he takes his vows seriously?
It depends. Defending the Wall and the North? Probably not. Not banging Ygritte at the first opportunity? Definitely.

Um, just because some knights don't keep their vows doesn't mean they all don't.
Â 
Martin's story features many characters trying to live up to their ideals, and struggling with it.Â  But I can't see how you can read the text as endorsing the idea that trying to live up to those ideals is automatically foolish; the series isn't nihilistic, ultimately.Â  It's about acknowledging the complexities of trying to live by ideals in the real world.Â  There are "true knights" in Martin's world, just as there are monsters.Â  Characters like Ned Stark, Jon Arryn, Brienne of Tarth, Barristan Selmy, and Duncan the Tall breathe the same air as Gregor Clegane, Tywin Lannister, Roose and Ramsay Bolton, and the Brave Companions.Â  Being good is hard, and rarely as clean in action as you would like.

Basically, this series is about the death of the fairy tale. Deal with it.

2740	Colonel Green	2014-05-07	The only one of your "good" examples who's a knight is Ser Barristan, and I don't rank high knights who witness the violent rape of their Queen.


Strictly speaking, one imagines that Jon Arryn was a knight before he became a lord.Â  But regardless, whether one has actually sworn the vows is not the core of the matter (indeed, focusing on that is the sort of highly formalistic thing the series thinks doesn't matter), but the actions and the attempt to be a hero -- Brienne and Duncan are two of the most obvious examples of this theme, people who aren't technically knights but nevertheless try their hardest to live by the code.
Â 
The conflicting nature of knights' vows (indeed, all vows) are kind of a big theme in the series, and that's hardly a new idea in fiction, either.Â  If you actually read the medieval stories of King Arthur and Camelot, the conflicts between the heart and ones oaths, and between different oaths, have always been present.Â  Barristan's story wouldn't be out of place at the Round Table.
Â 
If you mean "fairy tale" in the sense of people being Good and Evil and the Good Guys win because of their moral superiority and live happily ever after, that's certainly true.Â  But it seems like you mean that Martin is dismissing idealism itself, and that's not true.Â  He shows that having ideals isn't a silver bullet, and in practice there are many challenges involved in trying to implement them in the real world. George R. R. Martin was a conscientious objector in Vietnam.Â  I rather doubt that this series is about how idealism is fundamentally misguided, otherwise he should have just picked up a rifle and got on with it.

Sansa's degelopment takes time in the novels. She starts noticing something isn't right with her view on true knights around the time of Neds execution. 
But at the same time as some things opening her eyes to reality, there are oter people who more closely resemble her ideals... Ser Loras for example. Or Dontos. Even the hound, who isn't even a knight obviously. 
So she kinda clings on to her ideals as they crumble around her I guess.
2742	Grail King	2014-05-08	I was disappointed that they've made Sansa LF's niece rather than his bastard daughter. Â Sansa's pushing herself to be "bastard brave" was, I felt, a significant step in her emotional development; feeling both hidden and bolder due to her bastard status. Â And I think making her LF's fake niece is less squicky if LF continues to touch Sansa, and less dramatic.
Â 
I wasn't sure if TV-Sansa was lying when she was babbling about LF thinking her a "stupid little girl", or she really believed it. Â 
Â 
I thought Kate Dickie did a marvelous job, and actually pushed LF into some credible acting.


It came off to me that she was lying to her aunt, she combined her lines to Margery and Petyr to defuse the nutcase.
2743	Chebyshov	2014-05-08	It came off to me that she was lying to her aunt, she combined her lines to Margery and Petyr to defuse the nutcase.


Â 
That's how I read it. And it kind of recalled when Marg is trying to defuse Joff saying how she was just a "woman unfamiliar with the ways of war." I think Sansa uses her "stupid little girl" card in the same way.Â
2744	DaveyJoe	2014-05-08	Lol Ser Barristan the Bold is not craven or foolish.
He's Ser Grandfather. Legend of our times. Smashing slavers between the hammer and the anvil.
Â 


Â 
I love Barristan Selmy, he's one of my favorite characters, I was delighted that he got POV chapters in ADWD, I was even rocking a Barristan avatar for sometime... but he got played big time by the Shavepate.
2745	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-08	Â 
Well, according to this, Kate Dickie (174 cm) is almost as tall as Sophie Turner (175 cm). She's definitely taller than book!Lysa, who was significantly shorter than Sansa. However, she had big weight advantage, which show!Lysa definitely doesn't have. Although crazy people in a fit of rage can be surprisingly strong... But you'd expect the same - at the very least - from someone fighting for their life.


Â 
Â 
Well, in terms of drama, I think it has to be Lysa dragging someone to the Moon Door. Forget speculative measures of height and strength and leverage and so on: Lysa has "crazy person rage", and as justifications go, that'll do it.,Â 
Â 
However, I do like the idea of Mord as a stand-in for Marillion.
1 - Someone has to open the damn door, and it makes sense that it would be him.
1.5 - Lysa has no guards with her, crucially. Perhaps as some state, perhaps it can be Lysa's intention to use Mord, but in her craziness, she changes her mind.Â 
2 - Mord is dumb enough to just stand there and do nothing, and then be blamed (with whatever excuse LF decides to come up with).
Â 
Â 


It came off to me that she was lying to her aunt, she combined her lines to Margery and Petyr to defuse the nutcase.


Â 
Â 
Same here. I think she was just improvising to make crazy auntie leave her alone.
2746	DaveyJoe	2014-05-08	^ Yep, I think Mord is a good possibility, plus it would be a chance to show us that he used Tyrion's gold to make a new set of chompers.
2747	Petyr Patter	2014-05-08	On Alayne as a niece, did anyone else notice Robin call Littlfinger uncle?Â 
Â 
Now, Littlefinger is his step-father.
Â 
There is still a theory circulating that he actually fathered Robin while having an affair with Lysa, which explains his small stature.Â 
Â 
I think the creepiness of the situation from the books is still very much in play.
2748	Colonel Green	2014-05-08	So, we can sit back, enjoy it as it is, and wait for the moment until she finally saves herself or dies trying, or we can try to shoehorn a fairy tale or a Hollywood chick flick into her arc.


Who was talking about "fairy tales"?Â  There's a difference between fairy tales and idealism. Martin is most certainly not saying that the latter is foolish -- the ideal of the "true knight" drives many of the characters as they try to do good, with the full understanding that the world isn't a fairy tale.

2750	Le Cygne	2014-05-08	By the way that is described the same way in Cersei's fantasy, it's easy to see what the author is saying when you look at the words.Â Rhaegar and Cersei (Cersei's fantasy):Â And so it had, though once she had drawn a picture of herself flying behind Rhaegar on a dragon, her arms wrapped tight about his chest.Â Sandor rescuing Sansa:Â Sandor Clegane cantered briskly through the gates astride Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s chestnut courser.Â  The girl was seated behind, both arms tight around the Hound's chest.Â Also he only uses the term moist-eyed twice in the series:Â Catelyn remembering Jeyne Poole looking at Robb:Â She had seen Jeyne Poole giving him moist-eyed glances, and some of the serving girls, even ones as old as eighteen...Â Ned observing Sansa watching the Hound at the tournament:Â Ned Stark would have loved nothing so well as to see them both lose, but Sansa was watching it all moist-eyed and eager.Put the link in the next post...

2751	DaughterOfThe9Moons	2014-05-09	I don't want to derail the thread talking of Ser Barristan, but... well, who am I kidding, I will...
Ser Barristan thinks he would have killed Robert if he was there when Robert said "I only see dragonspawn". The thing is, Ser Barristan had plenty of opportunities to kill Robert, considering any vows and pardons given by him are invalid since he's an usurper, and cross the Narrow Sea to deliver his head to his rightful King, Viserys of House Targaryen. And he ends up serving the Targaryens later on. There is a line in the show, said by Ned at Jaime which is something like this "You've served the Mad King well, while serving him was safe". And this sort of applies to Ser Barristan, who turns his cloak twice in the series. He served the Mad King well, while serving him gave him what he desired (well, except for Ashara), and then he did the same for Robert. He only looked for Danny when they told him his life as a White Cloak was at an end. If Joffrey hasn't dissmissed him, he would have reacted to Sansa Beating Time in the same fashion he reacted to Rhaella Targaryen Raping Time and, had Daennerys finally invaded Westeros, he would have fought under Joffrey's banner, against her.
But serving Joffrey no longer gave him the social position/job he wanted, so it was just then we he decided that the Targaryens were the true Kings after all.



I am completely with you on Barristan. I have never understood why so many people see him as extremely honourable and the epitome of a true knight. I don't think he is an evil man by any means but he is not as principled as people seem to believe and his changes of allegiance were completely self serving.
Â

Agreed. The idealistic concept of the 'true knight' is present in the arcs of many characters, not only Sansa's but (most obviously though not exclusively) Brienne's and Jaime's too.
2752	Le Cygne	2014-05-09	Yep, true knight is explored with Sansa/Sandor and Jaime/Brienne.Â Both Sansa and Brienne bring up the ideal of the true knight. Sandor and Jaime shoot it down, there's no such thing (and you cant take what they say literally, you miss most of the story that way). Then both men turn around and are true knights.Â Sandor rescues Sansa, and there's the image GRRM has on his site, the maiden tightly holding her knight in shining armor's chest.Â  Jaime rescues Brienne, she's even wearing a pink dress as her knight rescues the maiden, and he calls that out, that he only rescues maidens (and he's got that image on his site, too).Â Sansa/Sandor:http://www.georgerrm...ns/san-san-str/Jaime/Brienne:http://www.georgerrm...e-with-brienne/Â And there's much more.

Â 
Brienne gets the "rescued maiden" role in that instant, but generally, Brienne is the true knight (not literally) who fights for the handsome king she adores (courtly love gender-reversed), for a lady she admires (refreshingly, a knight can swear allegiance to a lady without any romantic overtones... especially when they're both heterosexual women), and for the honor of another handsome but morally ambiguous male knight, and tries to rescue maidens (again, it's a refreshing take on the classic scenario with no romantic overtones of "male hero rescues damsels").
2754	Le Cygne	2014-05-09	My point was that Sandor and Jaime were, while outwardly shooting down the notion of a true knight, which they both did, true knights for these women who had these ideals.

Well, maybe you can discuss "The Hound as a True Knight" with Mycah's father. Or remember what this True Knight did when the maiden in distress was attacked, not by unarmed peasants, but by the Black Prince and his Evohl Henchmen, all of the latter armored, armed and highly trained.

And Brienne fails to protect Renly, fails to bring Jaime to KL's unhurt (if anything, it's Jaime who ends up saving her instead) and will fail to rescue Sansa. She'll be lucky to leave the BWB alive and even luckier if she manages to protect Pod. In the fairy tales, the True Knight succeeds.

They were not completely self-serving, no. The man had served a king who was sadistic and insane, and upon being given a chance to serve a king who was not (with all the others of that family dead or gone), he chose to serve.
Barristan is principled - but that principle is obedience. The Kingsguard do not get to judge those they serve, and those who do are failures & oathbreakers, such as Jaime.
Â 
In retrospect, you can hardly blame Jaime for stabbing that deranged SOB of a king, but not matter what good may have come from it, it still makes him an oathbreaker. Being so young is probably what pushed him over the edge - having to stand by as atrocities are committed, and more are planned, he could not take it. Jaime's arrogance prevents him from taking responsibility later (and resenting that people like Eddard judge him for it), and it was Robert who let him off the hook, but the one person who should be most offended by Jaime's continued existence is Barristan, the only other man from Aerys' kingsguard.
Â 
I think the reasons why Barristan is able to serve Robert, and serve beside Jaime, are ultimately linked to his own principles: 1) Guilt over having served & protected an evil king such as Aerys to the detriment of the realm, which might be assuaged by serving Robert (who seemed more honourable) and 2) the fact both he and Jaime have been pardoned by a King (Robert) and their code means they cannot take up that quarrel without breaking it.
I suppose there is also 3) Barristan had served Aerys to the best of his ability, and Rhaegar was dead, along with Aegon and Rhaenys; he had fought and nearly died in Aerys' cause, and it could not be said he ever broke his oath. The KG were sworn to the crown, not the man. Robert understood this, and spared him from both death and disgrace (the disgrace of not serving anymore). Barristan took the opportunity to continue serving, because that is what he is. If he could not stomach serving Robert, I bet he would have joined the Watch. (And if Joffrey had sent him to the Watch to serve, instead of just dismissing him, then he would not have erupted in anger as his dignity was taken away.)

I see what you're saying but I don't find obedience to be a particularly honourable principle. I mean the Hound killed Mycah out of obedience to Cersei. He was only doing his duty but people are no less disgusted with him because of it. The books are full of people doing their duty but that doesn't make them truly honourable, only honourable in that they do not break their oaths, even when those oaths compel them to do truly depraved things.
I still view Barristan's changes of allegiance as self serving in that they were an excuse not to choose a side, not to stand up for anything he really believed in only to find a ruler, any ruler and serve.Â
2758	Colonel Green	2014-05-10	I see what you're saying but I don't find obedience to be a particularly honourable principle.


Barristan begins to question it as well, ultimately, but obedience is considered an extremely important component of honour in Medieval systems of morality (and, indeed, until quite recently; really, it didn't really begin breaking down in full until the second half of the 20th century).
Â 

I still view Barristan's changes of allegiance as self serving in that they were an excuse not to choose a side, not to stand up for anything he really believed in only to find a ruler, any ruler and serve.

Barristan's covert examination of Dany shows that he was assessing her qualities as a leader, trying to avoid a repeat of past experiences.

As for your last paragraph. Martin is pacifist as far as I can tell. And there is a very strong anti-war message in the books. But look how it's delivered: by showing how brutal war is. If anything, he falls short at times. In other words, ASOIAF is not a wish fulfillment fiction. In a way, he's showing the flaws in our own "songs" and that's why it's not a fairy tale, specially not one of the 20th century "sanitized" versions. Many of the real world fairy tales, folk legends and even actual history and news covering (think, for instance, your typical First Gulf War TV coverage, which favored footage of "smart" bombs falling right on target, despite guided munitions being the minority of munitions used back then) are as flawed and hide so many unpleasant truths (ie, medieval knights were far closer to the thugs of Mara Salvatrucha than to Sir Lancelot) as Sansa's favorite songs are.
Â 
And, to get back to the topic of Sansa, her arc is specifically about the complete subversion, through cynicism, of the many fairy tales of the princess in a tower/damsel in distress waiting for a Hero to save her. Did anyone notice than in most (if not all) retellings of Sleeping Beauty, the Prince doesn't know that kissing her will wake her up? Even the only time she's actually saved (during the KL riots), the Hounds dismisses it because he was cutting through unarmed peasants who didn't bother to fight back. Quite the fairy tale, right?
So, we can sit back, enjoy it as it is, and wait for the moment until she finally saves herself or dies trying, or we can try to shoehorn a fairy tale or a Hollywood chick flick into her arc.
.True
And I guess the anti war position and the deconstruction of conventional ideas about the possibility of heroic warfare is the strongest message Martin wishes to transport to us readers. There is no morally right, no "good" way to lead a war, may it be Tywin's or Robb's war. These are the experiences of the generation when Martin was socialized politically. 
"There is no right life in the wrong one", Adorno.
There is no room for true heroes to keep their hands clean as long as they use the conventional means of warfare, violence and ruling. We see it in Dany's arc, we saw Robb the young hero commit crimes of war and any other potential hero leading armies, may it be Jaime, Tyrion or Jon, will have dirty hands in the end, will load himself with guilt and death or fail. And Martin made a point in showing us - like HBO btw - that those who do the right thing at times, like e.g. Sandor or Jaime, have done the most atrocious crimes before and may continue to do so.

....
Oathkeeping and similiar loaylties are not a value in itself. We see the Kingsguard "standing by" or even taking part when Aerys tortured, when Joffrey had Sansa beaten, people do the wrong things all the time out of in their timesetting justified loyalty.

Â 
You're mixing up genres. There are no knights, true or otherwise, in fairy tales. The main characters in fairy tales are either princesses and princes, or plucky peasants/common folk. Classic fairy tales are products of folklore - i.e. they come from the imagination of the "common folk" - while the more modern ones, those who are not from oral tradition, were written by mostly middle class authors and often read like morality tales or metaphors. The former typically have happy endings, the latter not necessarily (don't expect happy endings from Hans Christian Andersen; but also, for instance, Charles Perrault's late 17th century version of "Red Riding Hood" ends with the wolf devouring the heroine, because the author was writing it as a morality tale/warning to young girls). Neither deal with the ideals or concepts of chivalry. In many fairy tales, heroes and heroines prevail by using trickery against the more powerful villains, and can be very cruel to the villains (see: what happens to the Evil Queen in the original version of Snow White).
Â 
What you're referring to is medieval chivalric romance, which as written by and for aristocracy, which introduced the concept of courtly love and is responsible for the ideas about knights and chivalry we have today. They normally have happy endings, yes - but that's not always the case: "Tristan and Iseult" is a romantic tragedy in all its versions, and some of the most famous stories, such as those derived from the legends of king Arthur and the knights of the Round Table, are pretty damn dark, and don't exactly have the happiest of endings. Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere don't exactly have happy fates.
Â 
Anyway, I don't see how Brienne would be less of a "true knight" if she fails in her quest. Success or failure is not what defines it, the concept of "true knight" refers to the ideals and morality. Not that you can know what Brienne will or will not succeed doing; you can't know if she'll be a complete failure unless you have a crystal ball. You seem very convinced that in GRRM's work, idealism and ethical behavior always lead to failure while ruthlessness and immorality lead to success. Well, I'm afraid that the fates of Tywin Lannister, the Bloody Mummers and Gregor Clegane (currently a reanimated corpse) and most his men as well as the current predicament of the house Frey prove that you're wrong about the latter. Now, it's theoretically possible that Littlefinger, Roose and Ramsey will end the series triumphant - I admit that I don't have a crystal ball; but I am willing to bet that they won't...

We have such things as the Geneva Convention, which are based on the idea that there is a right and a wrong way to lead a war and no, all is not fair in war; that things like rape, torture, killing civilians, killing prisoners of war, genocide, are war crimes and those who commit them shall be punished, and that it's not something you can just wave away with "oh, well, war is awful, people will do awful things in war, what can you do. Everyone is bad, so no one is bad, let's just not punish war crimes at all, because war in itself is a crime".
Â 
ASOAIF does not represent that kind of moral relativism, either. GRRM writes a number of grey characters, but he also makes sure to write characters who are reprehensibly evil and shown to commit disgusting and horrible crimes, who the audience is clearly supposed to hate. Gregor Clegane exists in his writing alongside Duncan the Tall; Vargo Hoat, Chyswick, Raff, the Tickler, Polliver, Rorge and Biter exist alongside Brienne. You're telling me that there is no difference between GRRM wrote Robb Stark, or, for that matter, Stannis, as a military commander, and how he wrote Tywin Lannister? I'm not a fan of Stannis, but he and Robb both prove that it's possible for a commander to impose strict rules on their army and punish things like rape or murder of children prisoners, and even if some of Robb's forces commit awful crimes, that's quite different from Tywin, who orders and encourages rape and murder of innocents as a war tactic.
Â 
As for GRRM's views of war, you've both ignored the part where he says that he wasn't against war in general, he was against that one specific war (the Vietnam War) and that he would have fought in the Second World War:
Â 
In 1966, you entered Northwestern, in Evanston, Illinois. I know that in the years that followed you underwent some serious moral and political changes due to your opposition to the Vietnam War.
I was, like many kids of my generation, a hawk. I accepted that America was the good guys, we had to be there. When I got into college, the more I learned about our involvement in Vietnam, the more it seemed wrong to me. Of course, the draft was happening, and I decided to ask for the conscientious-objector status. I wasn't a complete pacifist; I couldn't claim to be that. I was what they called an objector to a particular war. I would have been glad to fight in World War II. But Vietnam was the only war on the menu. So I applied for conscientious-objector status in full belief that I would be rejected, and that I would have a further decision to make: Army, jail or Canada. I don't know what I would've done. Those were desperately hard decisions, and every kid had to make them for himself. To my surprise, they gave me the status. I was later told â<U+0080><U+0093> I have no way to prove this â<U+0080><U+0093> that I was granted the status because our conservative draft board felt that anyone who applied for CO status should be granted it, because that would be punishment enough: Then it would be part of their permanent record, and everybody would know that they were a Commie sympathizer, and it would ruin their lives.

Â 
So, no. GRRM was against the Vietnam war, which USA had no business leading (quite right), but does not appear to think that peace is always better than war, even when the war is about defeating an evil such national-socialism and fascism; I don't think that he thinks that peace should be held at any costs even if it means allowing oppression, abuse, torture, slavery and genocide. He certainly doesn't seem to think it would have been better if every country tried to make peace with the nazi Germany and if Europe had decades of peace during which the nazis continued to kill the Jews, Roma and disabled people in gas chambers.

2761	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-10	I don't think Barristan is all that self serving and I don't think he turned his cloak. 
He was Aerys II kings guard. He fought for him and was gravely wounded. When he recovered, there was a new king. Should he have asked Bob to behead him? Viserys wasn't king. He was never crowned. He fled into exile. Kings don't flee into exile. They sit the throne. Like Bob. The King. 
Then Bob kicked it and Joff ascended to the throne. What was Barristan to do? 
Then he was relieved of his duties. He was oath free as it were. 
And in his POVs he thinks about what he has done and who he has served and was it right or wrong? 
He decides the Lannisters are usurpers (They are) and that he made a mistake on the trident in swearing to protect the new king. He even makes comment as to spending his life protecting a mad man and a drunkard. He wants to make amends by seeking out Dany and helping her claim the throne. Is that right? Time will tell. 
But he has learned. He doesn't swear to Dany inmediatly (in the books anyway). He watches her. He assesses her to make sure she isn't the mad king mark II. 
I think he has doubts as to some of her actions. Personally I think he is making the same mistake again when he protected the mad king. 
Assuming he wasn't dismissed by Joffrey, would he have stood by or worse, participated in beating Sansa? I don't know. Maybe... That's the thing with swearing to obey a king, regardless of his sanity.

Â 
Barristan to me has always just been a man who has extreme moral sense for duty. He has and will always serve the "crown". Which at the time was the Targaryens and after all Aerys II wasn't always the mad king (from Barristans pov) it was only when Aerys got captured and imprisoned when he finally snapped. And Barristan is still even conflicted about if saving Aerys was the right or wrong thing todo. Not to mention even when Aerys became the mad king, Barristan still knew his son had true greatness in him and even though the realm would have to suffer through the mad kings reign, he would one day be replaced by Rhaegar, one of the greatest men Barristan has ever known. But this didn't come to pass and Robert became King.
Â 
So when Barristan was given the option of still serving in the kings guard (a order in which he loves and devoted to) by Robert, I don't see why he wouldn't. After all he just served a mad king, Robert reign surely couldn't be as bad. And it wasn't, sure Robert was a drunk and a abit of a lout, he may not have been another "Rhaegar" but he wasn't another "Mad King" either. It was when Robert died Barristan received his biggest slap to the face by Joffery/Cersei, that he was to leave the kings guard (a post that you serve for life) and is to be replaced by (of all people) the Hound. Then he had his life threatened when Joffery/Cersei sends five men to apprehend him, Barristan had two options, live the rest of his life as a wanted man with nothing or seek out the last Targaryens and plege his serves to them. Which he did when he thinks Dany is not going to be another "mad king" but maybe a "Rhaegar" reborn. But as the reader we still don't know if Barristan has choice correctly in his opinians, after all Dany could just take up drinking put ona few 100 pounds and be the "Drunken lout Queen of Meereen"

Only Dany's story introduces bigger and more important issues about freedom. We as readers may root for this or that group or character  because we get attached to one side for very personal reasons but the Westerosi common folk suffers no matter who wins and will hardly feel the difference between exploitation by one or the other noble family. No way Robb's or Stannis' cause can be seen as rightfully defending democracy against faschist Lannisters or Tyrells. Actually this comparison would be slightly offensive towards Hitler's victims.

2765	juanml82	2014-05-10	Â 
You're mixing up genres. There are no knights, true or otherwise, in fairy tales. The main characters in fairy tales are either princesses and princes, or plucky peasants/common folk. Classic fairy tales are products of folklore - i.e. they come from the imagination of the "common folk" - while the more modern ones, those who are not from oral tradition, were written by mostly middle class authors and often read like morality tales or metaphors. The former typically have happy endings, the latter not necessarily (don't expect happy endings from Hans Christian Andersen; but also, for instance, Charles Perrault's late 17th century version of "Red Riding Hood" ends with the wolf devouring the heroine, because the author was writing it as a morality tale/warning to young girls). Neither deal with the ideals or concepts of chivalry. In many fairy tales, heroes and heroines prevail by using trickery against the more powerful villains, and can be very cruel to the villains (see: what happens to the Evil Queen in the original version of Snow White).
Â 
What you're referring to is medieval chivalric romance, which as written by and for aristocracy, which introduced the concept of courtly love and is responsible for the ideas about knights and chivalry we have today. They normally have happy endings, yes - but that's not always the case: "Tristan and Iseult" is a romantic tragedy in all its versions, and some of the most famous stories, such as those derived from the legends of king Arthur and the knights of the Round Table, are pretty damn dark, and don't exactly have the happiest of endings. Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere don't exactly have happy fates.


Well, then it's cynicism 1, medieval chivalric romance 0
Â 

Anyway, I don't see how Brienne would be less of a "true knight" if she fails in her quest. Success or failure is not what defines it, the concept of "true knight" refers to the ideals and morality. Not that you can know what Brienne will or will not succeed doing; you can't know if she'll be a complete failure unless you have a crystal ball. You seem very convinced that in GRRM's work, idealism and ethical behavior always lead to failure while ruthlessness and immorality lead to success. Well, I'm afraid that the fates of Tywin Lannister, the Bloody Mummers and Gregor Clegane (currently a reanimated corpse) and most his men as well as the current predicament of the house Frey prove that you're wrong about the latter. Now, it's theoretically possible that Littlefinger, Roose and Ramsey will end the series triumphant - I admit that I don't have a crystal ball; but I am willing to bet that they won't...
Â 
Â 

I've never said that. If you think ASOIAF in black and white terms, it would make sense, but ASOIAF it's not about black and white. It's not that idealism and ethical behavior lead to failure per se, it's that naivety and idealism for the sake of idealism lead to failure. Ned naively trusted LF to act against his own interests, Robb naively believed he could afford to marry for love, Theon naively believed he could rule Winterfell and earn his father's acceptance, Sansa used to believe in True Knights and Brienne naively believes she can find Sansa.
Pragmatism, OTOH, works: Tywin Lannister is a successful character until he's undone by a very non pragmatic underestimation of his son, the Tyrells first starve the Kingslanders to death and then appear as their saviors. And pragmatism, in Westeros, means that sometimes the character has to get his hands dirty.
Â 
As for Brienne rescuing Arya, she's in Braavos and needs no rescue. As for Sansa, what happened to all that discussion about agency and everything else? Not only Brienne is a captive hundreds of miles away from her, Sansa's arc is heading into the direction of "rescuing" herself instead of relying on a True Knight, however subverted the trope might be.
Â 

Really? I'm afraid that contemporary international laws disagree with you. We have such things as the Geneva Convention, which are based on the idea that there is a right and a wrong way to lead a war and no, all is not fair in war; that things like rape, torture, killing civilians, killing prisoners of war, genocide, are war crimes and those who commit them shall be punished, and that it's not something you can just wave away with "oh, well, war is awful, people will do awful things in war, what can you do. Everyone is bad, so no one is bad, let's just not punish war crimes at all, because war in itself is a crime".
Â 
ASOAIF does not represent that kind of moral relativism, either.

Â 

Most wars ignore, to a degree, the Geneva Convention and winners never go on trial.
As for ASOIAF, would you kindly quote any part of the text where Robb Stark punish rapists or impose strict rules? "Children prisoners" were "nephews of Tywin Lannister held as hostage" whose death could very well lead to the execution of Sansa Stark, specially since Robb no longer had Jaime prisoner. It's really a matter for another thread, but Robb ordered the sacking of the Westerlands. As for Stannis, he burns people as a mean of execution and employs people like Clayton Suggs.
So no, not really. GRRM shows that Woman of War ideas about what a war really is do apply. What he does is to make sure readers root for one side/character, so they overlook (and die hard fans even get worked out and upset) and defend their favorite character despite the crimes he either commits or order/allow his soldiers to commit.

Not true.Â  Tywin's "pragmatism" is shown by the narrative to be extremely shortsighted in casting aside understood rules like the guest right.Â  He's undermining the entire system that allows for diplomacy and trust relationships for short-term gains.Â  And quite a few of the main characters' stories, and in particular redemptive ones, are the opposite of pragmatic.

The Blackwoods have no issue surrendering to Jaime Lannister. Manderly doesn't have any issue paying the ransom for his son (if anything, the Lannisters are the ones who should suspect foul play).

Of course. What I meant was that the breach of guest right didn't impede peace and hostage negotiations, parlays nor it broke trust in the word of the Iron Throne. Manderly expected Cersei to fulfill her part of the bargain, even after the RW.

What? I'm not sure how you got there from my comment. What do you mean?
2776	voodooqueen126	2014-05-11	Frankly, Robb's war against the Lannister's,* is far, far less justified than Vietnam,** and more on par with WW1; which started when a Â tubercular Bosnian Teenager assassinated an Austrian Archduke. Think of how many people died because of that.
I think the character arc that best discusses the rights and wrongs of starting wars (rather than Arya's arc which makes visible the consequences of war) is Daenery's debacle in Meereen. There Martin went out of his way to make residents of Slaver's Bay as morally bankrupt and unlikable as possible***...and the moral reformation of a society as a result of invasion is still shown as being incredibly problematic.Â 
Sansa's arc is more about personal morality, than the public morality associated with warfare.

***short of them committing genocide. But the Yunkai, Astapori, and Meereenese, it's like they got out of bed, ate their lead based porridge, whilst firmly clutching the villain ball, whilst being beaten with an ugly stick. They have nothing going for them, yet Daenerys is still portrayed ambiguously for invading them and trying to change their society.
2777	Annara Snow	2014-05-11	I do not think that any cause of Robb, Stannis or Renly is even remotely comparable to the cause of fighting the Nazis, those would-like-to-be kings are basically defending the interests of a very small group of whatever nobility and who wins is rather pointless for the majority of Westerosi population, it is one liege lord against the other.

Â 
I wasn't talking about the cause when comparing them, I was talking about the methods they use. You could say that soldiers on each side will do things like rape and murder civilians, but it's different when a commander orders such things, or, in case of Tywin, even specifically employs forces for that purpose.
Â 
GRRM portrays the horrors of war and shows the horrible reality of it, but he certainly doesn't portray every soldier character or commander character in the same light. If he wanted to, he could have shown Robb employing some version of Bloody Mummers/Gregor and specifically using them to rape, torture and murder smallfolk. He does show Robb ordering the sack of Westerlands but he conveniently doesn't specify what it would entail other than burning and looting. He also shows Stannis - for all his faults and moral ambiguity - punishing rapists severely, and he happens to show Stannis doing that at exactly the same moment when the readers are likely to start being on his side, since he has just come to the defense of the NW. You may want to think that all military commanders in ASOAIF are the same in terms of war ethics, but GRRM doesn't actually portray them that way. People like to talk about nobody being "completely good or completely evil" in ASOAIF, but it's not true, well, the latter is not true: it's very easy to think of people he purposefully made completely evil, which includes Gregor Clegane and his men and the Bloody Mummers. When the Bloody Mummers switch sides and start working for the northmen, this could be seen as a moment of moral ambiguity - except for the fact that they are working for Roose Bolton, another character GRRM has written as completely evil. The closest that GRRM goes in associating Robb with them is having them work for his bannerman who is a thousand miles away and commanding his own forces in that part of the Riverlands, not to mention with his own agenda (and is about to become a major antagonist in the next book).
Â 


Well, then it's cynicism 1, medieval chivalric romance 0
Â

Â 
Yes, it is, but that doesn't mean that someone whose goal is to rescue her has to be a failure. Contrary to the popular trope of Lone Hero, it's far more likely that people are going to succeed when they have help and collaborative efforts are more likely to succeed. Arya, for instance, could have died many times over in the firstÂ  books if she hadn't had help from various people, from Syrio to Yoren to Jaqen to Sandor. Yet I don't see anyone criticizing her for that out of an idea that she has to save herself all on her own with no help from anyone in order to be worthwhile.
Â

Â 
Yes, war is bad. Duh. That's not exactly a fresh new idea, you know. But there are still rules and ethics of conduct during war. Does everyone who breaks them get indicted and convicted for war crimes? Of course not. Do you think that everyone who commits crimes in peace gets brought to trial, convicted and sentenced? Do you think that maybe, just maybe, powerful and rich people have better of getting away with their crimes? But does that mean that there should be no law and everyone should just be allowed to do what they want? "Hey, since we can't punish everyone, let's just let everyone go"?
Â 
I've seen the "but war crimes just happen during the war, and not everyone who did it will be brought to trial!" argument IRL more times than I care to remember, and IRL it's always a part of an attempt to argue that no war crimes trials should be held at all. Yet, oddly enough, nobody ever tries to argue that there should be no courts, trials or jails in general, since it will never be possible to try and convict every criminal in the world, and some will always get away...
Â 
Regarding the Westerosi military commanders, I never said any of them were perfect; but there is a clear difference between having some douche in your service (what's Clayton Suggs done, anyway?) and a systematic policy of rape and murder of civilians through employing men who are clearly there just for that purpose (the Mountain and his men, the Bloody Mummers).

The closest that GRRM goes in associating Robb with them is having them work for his bannerman who is a thousand miles away and commanding his own forces in that part of the Riverlands, not to mention with his own agenda (and is about to become a major antagonist in the next book).


 
I'd like to add that Robb forbade Roose Bolton to flay their prisoners, just like Ned did, so he's not the kind of commander who indulges in cruelty.

2779	juanml82	2014-05-11	Frankly, Robb's war against the Lannister's,* is far, far less justified than Vietnam,** and more on par with WW1; which started when a Â tubercular Bosnian Teenager assassinated an Austrian Archduke. Think of how many people died because of that.
I think the character arc that best discusses the rights and wrongs of starting wars (rather than Arya's arc which makes visible the consequences of war) is Daenery's debacle in Meereen. There Martin went out of his way to make residents of Slaver's Bay as morally bankrupt and unlikable as possible***...and the moral reformation of a society as a result of invasion is still shown as being incredibly problematic.Â 
Sansa's arc is more about personal morality, than the public morality associated with warfare.
Â 
Â 
Â 
*From the perspective of modern morality, rather than medieval morality.
Â 
**Please remember that Communism has killed a greater number of people than Fascism
***short of them committing genocide. But the Yunkai, Astapori, and Meereenese, it's like they got out of bed, ate their lead based porridge, whilst firmly clutching the villain ball, whilst being beaten with an ugly stick. They have nothing going for them, yet Daenerys is still portrayed ambiguously for invading them and trying to change their society.


I understand that arguing about the justification of Vietnam is is off-topic. Nonetheless, I need to point out that two million Vietnamese died in the war and that the USA was supporting an unpopular dictatorship there.
And while we can say that "go to war and kill thousands because your father was imprisoned" isn't a good justification, a modern hypothetical example would be the arrest of an American high official or former president outside the USA for crimes of war/against mankind/plain murder, followed by an American military intervention in the country imprisoning him. And, TBH, the far fetched part of this hypothetical is any country trying to make the arrest.


Â 
I wasn't talking about the cause when comparing them, I was talking about the methods they use. You could say that soldiers on each side will do things like rape and murder civilians, but it's different when a commander orders such things, or, in case of Tywin, even specifically employs forces for that purpose.
Â 
GRRM portrays the horrors of war and shows the horrible reality of it, but he certainly doesn't portray every soldier character or commander character in the same light. If he wanted to, he could have shown Robb employing some version of Bloody Mummers/Gregor and specifically using them to rape, torture and murder smallfolk. He does show Robb ordering the sack of Westerlands but he conveniently doesn't specify what it would entail other than burning and looting. He also shows Stannis - for all his faults and moral ambiguity - punishing rapists severely, and he happens to show Stannis doing that at exactly the same moment when the readers are likely to start being on his side, since he has just come to the defense of the NW. You may want to think that all military commanders in ASOAIF are the same in terms of war ethics, but GRRM doesn't actually portray them that way. People like to talk about nobody being "completely good or completely evil" in ASOAIF, but it's not true, well, the latter is not true: it's very easy to think of people he purposefully made completely evil, which includes Gregor Clegane and his men and the Bloody Mummers. When the Bloody Mummers switch sides and start working for the northmen, this could be seen as a moment of moral ambiguity - except for the fact that they are working for Roose Bolton, another character GRRM has written as completely evil. The closest that GRRM goes in associating Robb with them is having them work for his bannerman who is a thousand miles away and commanding his own forces in that part of the Riverlands, not to mention with his own agenda (and is about to become a major antagonist in the next book).


The thing is that, as you say, GRRM conveniently leaves out the exact description of Robb's crimes. We do know Tywin orders chevauchA©e and we get a first hand impression of what it entails and the kind of people who carry it out. Robb orders the same, but we need to fill in the blanks. We do have mentions of Northern forces sacking and raping. We don't have a name for those criminals.
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 
Yes, it is, but that doesn't mean that someone whose goal is to rescue her has to be a failure. Contrary to the popular trope of Lone Hero, it's far more likely that people are going to succeed when they have help and collaborative efforts are more likely to succeed. Arya, for instance, could have died many times over in the firstÂ  books if she hadn't had help from various people, from Syrio to Yoren to Jaqen to Sandor. Yet I don't see anyone criticizing her for that out of an idea that she has to save herself all on her own with no help from anyone in order to be worthwhile.

Â 
Well, Sansa will have to get allies. Part of her narrative in the coming books should revolve about that. But her arc seems to be going in the direction of political allies instead of the very different knight coming to rescue her while she remains passive and is passively taken to safety so she can knit a fancy cloth for her rescuer.
And Brienne simply doesn't fit the role of a political ally.
Â 

Yes, war is bad. Duh. That's not exactly a fresh new idea, you know. But there are still rules and ethics of conduct during war. Does everyone who breaks them get indicted and convicted for war crimes? Of course not. Do you think that everyone who commits crimes in peace gets brought to trial, convicted and sentenced? Do you think that maybe, just maybe, powerful and rich people have better of getting away with their crimes? But does that mean that there should be no law and everyone should just be allowed to do what they want? "Hey, since we can't punish everyone, let's just let everyone go"?
Â 
I've seen the "but war crimes just happen during the war, and not everyone who did it will be brought to trial!" argument IRL more times than I care to remember, and IRL it's always a part of an attempt to argue that no war crimes trials should be held at all. Yet, oddly enough, nobody ever tries to argue that there should be no courts, trials or jails in general, since it will never be possible to try and convict every criminal in the world, and some will always get away...
Â 
Regarding the Westerosi military commanders, I never said any of them were perfect; but there is a clear difference between having some douche in your service (what's Clayton Suggs done, anyway?) and a systematic policy of rape and murder of civilians through employing men who are clearly there just for that purpose (the Mountain and his men, the Bloody Mummers).
Â 
Â 

Â 
Did I say anything remotely like the bolded part? No, I didn't.
As for Clayton Suggs, he has been Stannis torturer for years, which means he tortured people in Dragonstone dungeons, even during peacetime. Conveniently, GRRM leaves out the details.
Â 


 
I'd like to add that Robb forbade Roose Bolton to flay their prisoners, just like Ned did, so he's not the kind of commander who indulges in cruelty.


That's the show. I don't think there is any moment in the books in which Robb makes any ruling regarding torture, rape or murder.
2780	voodooqueen126	2014-05-11	I understand that arguing about the justification of Vietnam is is off-topic. Nonetheless, I need to point out that two million Vietnamese died in the war and that the USA was supporting an unpopular dictatorship there.
I am not denying that the Vietnam War was unjustified, but just pointing out that preventing the spread of communism is not an unworthy cause. Or atleast not a petty emotional one.
Â 
And while we can say that "go to war and kill thousands because your father was imprisoned" isn't a good justification, a modern hypothetical example would be the arrest of an American high official or former president outside the USA for crimes of war/against mankind/plain murder, followed by an American military intervention in the country imprisoning him. And, TBH, the far fetched part of this hypothetical is any country trying to make the arrest.
Â 
Oddly, I have roughly argued the same thing to LF defenders/trolls: that if an American President or British Prime minister was judicially murdered by another head of government whilst visiting a foreign country, there would probably be a war... hopefully not as disastrous as WW1.Â 
Â 
The thing is that, as you say, GRRM conveniently leaves out the exact description of Robb's crimes. We do know Tywin orders chevauchA©e and we get a first hand impression of what it entails and the kind of people who carry it out. Robb orders the same, but we need to fill in the blanks.

And Brienne simply doesn't fit the role of a political ally.
Well I agree that Sansa's arc (unless the show really does want to make Sansa remain a damsel in distress, as I fear) is about gaining political allies, but I am sure when/if Brienne eventually rocks up, she will serve some sort of purpose. Otherwise why subjugate us to that trek around the Crownlands?

Well do you think it is significant that GRRM elides over Robb's possible war crimes (such a modern notion)? Or the fact that Stannis employed Clayton Suggs for years? Whilst emphasising Tywin's numerous crimes?
2781	Zorn Gottes	2014-05-11	That's the show. I don't think there is any moment in the books in which Robb makes any ruling regarding torture, rape or murder.


really? I misremembered then, sorryÂ
2782	joachim	2014-05-11	What? I'm not sure how you got there from my comment. What do you mean?


After he was cashiered by Joffrey, Barristan crossed half of the worldÂ to find Daenerys, when he could've reached Highgarden or Dragonstone in a fraction of the time. In the book, Tywin was concerned that he would support Renly or Stannis and lend credibility to their causes. They were both closer at hand and either one must've seemed like a safer bet. Doesn't it prove his bona fides that he sought Daenerys?
2783	Wmarshal	2014-05-11	Apart of me thinks this extra sibling would be used to replace papa kettleblack. Be that with his sons gone who needs him.
2784	DaughterOfThe9Moons	2014-05-11	After he was cashiered by Joffrey, Barristan crossed half of the worldÂ to find Daenerys, when he could've reached Highgarden or Dragonstone in a fraction of the time.

Doesn't it prove his bona fides that he sought Daenerys?


Â 
Not really. He only sought her out after he had been dismissed by the Lannisters. Had he not been dismissed he would have continued to serve them regardless of his personal opinion of their regime. It would have supported his bona fides had he left his previous service to seek her out of his own volition. I don't even know how keen Renly or Stannis would have been to accept him anyway. Regardless of his prowess or reputation, he was an old man who would only have come to support them because he seemed to be out of other options. Hardly the epitome of a trustworthy recruit who, given the aforementioned reputation, would have to have been placed in a position of some power.
2785	DaughterOfThe9Moons	2014-05-11	Just to clarify, I am not saying that I believe Barristan is an evil person or anything, and I know that by Westerosi standards his loyalty and obedience make him a "good" man. It's just that I don't find his obedience or loyalty to be particularly honourable in that it caused him to stand by while truly awful acts were carried out and he never intervened because of his 'honour'. I just find it all a bit sickening really. I mean let's call a spade a spade here. He had many opportunities to seek out different employ and dedicate his honourable obedience to an honourable cause. The books are full of people making choices that challenge their preconceived notions of honour and Barristan made his choices to support some truly despicable people just because they happened to rule the country. Aerys tortured his wife and planned to burn everyone in King's Landing to death and Barristan just stood there and was like "Welp, you're the boss." Uhhhhh, ok?
Remember, all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.

Â 
I can see where your coming from with Barristan, I really do, but as I've said already Barristan does not "honour" Aerys II, he honours the crown. Two very different things. And has someone has already said, this is the trouble with a order who vows to protect the King, not the crown. I also always look at wider theme of what people honour has cost the realm so far, when it comes to Barristan. Take Ned for example; it was Neds honour which cost him his life and was one of the key events that brought the realm into mass civil war. Same with his son Robb, if it wasn't for Robb's honour that he married Jayne Westerling (books not show), he would have married a Fray and not got himself, his family and men massacred as a result, allowing the Lannisters to remain ruling Westeros. This is one of the many reasons why I love the books so much, because it brings into question the values of such things as honour. Is it that no person should have honour because it can lead to the result of evil things? Or is it that more people should have honour so these evil things can't take root?
Â 
And I agree with the saying "all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing", but isn't the saying "good does not always triumph over evil" just as true?

Â 
Â 
You say that honouring the crown and honouring Aerys II are two very different things and theoretically you are right but in reality they are one and the same. Barristan's loyalty to the "crown" is directly translated into loyalty to the King, regardless of who he is or what he does. So it may make his changes of allegiance understandable and "honourable" since he is supporting whoever is wearing that precious crown but as I have said, I don't think it's honourable to stand by and allow mad men to torture, burn and kill solely because they're wearing the crown you hold so dear. He knows it too.
Â 

I also always look at wider theme of what people honour has cost the realm so far, when it comes to Barristan. Take Ned for example; it was Neds honour which cost him his life and was one of the key events that brought the realm into mass civil war.

Is it that no person should have honour because it can lead to the result of evil things? Or is it that more people should have honour so these evil things can't take root?

Â 
Â 
The problem wasn't that Ned and Robb had honour, the problem was that they were stupid and naive. They could have retained their honour and achieved what they intended but they underestimated their opponents severely. I guess they believed that their code of honour was universal when it was plain to see that it wasn't. It's not a matter or honour leading to good or evil in and of itself, it's the blind adherence to a code of "honour" (or any doctrine really) that is devoid of personal responsibility, moral integrity and common sense that causes problems.
Â 
Â 

And I agree with the saying "all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing", but isn't the saying "good does not always triumph over evil" just as true?

Â 
Absolutely, but just because there is a possibility of failure, that's no reason not to try at all.

Guys, since this discussion is really off-topic,...


Â 
Well, someone will have to explain me what Barristan hate rant, Communism and Nazis have anything to do with GoT and Sansa... Let it be known that I personally don't like my thread being turned into off-topic discussions and for those of you who consciously decided to do that, I would ask for restrain the next time. The next episode will be rather significant for Sansa and I don't want these off-topic discussions to take place. Take them where they belong.
2791	Swordofthemornin	2014-05-11	So in the show, we have the character Locke, sent to "infiltrate" the watch. Presumably to sabotage Jon Snow in some way.Â 
Â 
But, we then have him stealing Bran? What is his intention at this point, to smuggle him back to the Dreadfort? to then murder/ransom/hostage him?
Â 
Finding Bran was surely not always his intent either, but he seems to know soon as he finds him that he intends to capture him?Â 
Â 
If he was simply going to kill him he would have killed the rest of the party before he left to make sure they didn't talk.
Â 
If i've missed something I Â apologise

2793	DaveyJoe	2014-05-13	Roose sent Locke north specifically to find Bran and Rickon, he went to the Night's Watch because Theon said Jon Snow was there and his brothers may have sought him out.
2794	Swordofthemornin	2014-05-13	Thank you Daveyjoe.
Â 
I recall the meeting Roose had with Locke, Theon and Ramsay, but I couldn't remember what was said.Â
2795	A Raven	2014-05-05	I know there is a thread already on Craster's as filler, but I wanted to tie it into some bigger threads that are not covered there, and probably would be lost in the 7+ pages of post already there (as it's degenerated currently into the efficacy of Valyrian steel against bone).Â At first glance, the Craster's Keep arc feels like filler. Â It feels like bad writing, something glommed together perhaps to tug on heartstrings with another Stark faux-reunion. Â But bear in mind that there are a number of other things omitted from the books that have had readers feeling that there will be problems in the future. Â I wanted to write out a list of some of the things that are addressed with this arc, and what was expended to take care of them here, and how fine of a job the writers managed to do in order to clean it up as neatly as it was done. Â In no particular order:Explore the Great White North
	Spoiler Â The show writers want to remind the viewers that the Others-beyond-the-wall are an important and major threat. There is much more exposition in the book about them, and the format itself means that they are very likely to be in the readers' mind even when they are not mentioned. For show viewers, they were seen in the first episode. Next, they are seen with Craster's child in season 2, and closing off the season at the Fist of the First Men. After that, Sam kills one in season 3. That's it. Viewers have much more reason to fear the wights than the Others, as other than killing the first disposable characters the viewers meet in the first episode, they steal a baby and get killed by a fat coward (as he is presented to viewers! Don't worry, Sam's cool...), and nothing else. As such, the viewers need both to be reminded of their existence AND be convinced of the severity of their threat. Using Craster's last son provides this opportunity.
Bring Ghost back to Jon
	Spoiler Ghost went missing in the first half of Season 3. Perhaps viewers largely forgot about him, but they needed a way to bring him back to Jon without having him randomly show up at the northern gate of Castle Black or scale the Wall by himself.
Delay wildling attack on the Wall
	Spoiler They've moved around some of the occurrences surrounding the battle at the Wall, but both with Stannis going to Braavos and Jon's early return, as well as his being judged by Janos Slynt and Alliser Thorne prior to the attack from the south. Most likely, the battle itself will be condensed, the attack from the front will coincide with the attack from the south, and while the Night's Watch will defeat the Thenns + Tormund, Stannis will show up just in time to break the main wildling attack from the north. To accomplish this, there needed to be action in Jon Snow's story that can at least be claimed to delay the attack, as without the mutineers, apparently Mance cannot learn that the Night's Watch is weak. I do not recall if in the show they mentioned Mance coming to Winterfell to see King Robert in the flesh, but if they haven't, I doubt they will because he obviously would have determined the state of the Night's Watch's strength at that point.
Jon's knowledge of Bran's survival
	Spoiler They get to have Sam both to be a loyal friend to Jon rather than hold to vows and words. This will lead more easily to a sexual relationship with Gilly and his eventual rescue of her and child from Moletown. Having Jon get the catharsis of cleaning out Craster's Keep, after it has been identified as the one possible location for Bran to have stopped by that they might find him, means that he can set that to rest for the moment. Or, they could recycle it later and omit the Hardhome ranging in favor of Jon using his power as eventual Lord Commander to organize a ranging to "rescue" Bran.
Appease modern feminists
	Spoiler There's been a lot of rape and removal of women's agency recently. Having a Crasterwife save Jon, then them strike off on their own direction (perhaps they could combine the elder Crasterwife with Mother Mole if they DO want to have Hardhome happen later?) will do much to pay lipservice to feminism.
Justify Jon's reputation with Night's Watch rank and file
	Spoiler The viewers have ample reason to root for Jon Snow. Most of the Night's Watch would only know him as a bastard born of traitor's stock who was resentful of his appointment as Mormont's steward, his preferential treatment in being able to range with Qhorin Halfhand, and then joining the wildlings after killing the Halfhand, who was revered. Then he comes back full of arrows, and pronounces his oathbreaking. A successful return from the difficult sortie to Craster's Keep will justify his reputation in their eyes and undermine Thorne's position when it comes time to elect a new Lord Commander. This is done quietly without much exploration of Night's Watch politics, as the show has less time to devote to that.
Increase the Crannogmen's importance without storytelling
	Spoiler Meera is severely undermined in this arc, as viewers cannot take her seriously as a huntress. She was surprised by the mutineers, and the next episode they were slaughtered like drunken pigs. So the tradeoff was to make them more mystic by showing Jojenvision to the audience. Jojenvision becomes the necessary guide for Bran. Meera, however, is presently superfluous. She will prove essential in a few episodes, but she has to climb back of the uselessness hole the writers put her into. It is also very unlikely that the Reeds will tell the story of the Knight of the Laughing Tree, but if they do, it will be because they traded Meera's worldly know-how for making her a keeper of lore.
Direct Bran north in a very specific way without Coldhands
	Spoiler Jojenvision shows them the way North, which will be expedited and finish by the end of the season, sans Coldhands. Incidentally, it alludes to Jojen's potential death when Bran gets north.
Set up a causus belli for the Boltons against Jon Snow without Farya
	Spoiler The Bastard of Bolton has less exploration in the show than in the books, despite being explored earlier. And it looks like the Winterfell marriage arc is unlikely to happen as written - they can dodge the necessity of it by setting up a conflict between the Boltons and Jon Snow; how will Roose react when Locke does not return and Jon Snow becomes Lord Commander of the Night's Watch? He will clearly view him as an enemy even prior to (or without) the conflicts in the book when he's mucking about in Northern affairs by supporting Stannis and playing matchmaker/King in the North by interfering with the Karstark family, something that legally is the responsibility and privilege of the Warden of the North, Roose Bolton.
Clean itself up
	Spoiler Mutineers were introduced and removed. Locke was continued and removed. With the literal burning of the keep, the extra elements added in are cleaned up while the story has been springboarded along.
It's hard to say for certain if it was worthwhile, but there's absolutely an argument to be made for the expediency of storytelling, and it provided more flexibility than shows up at first blush in terms of future events for the series.
2796	Adhara	2014-05-06	Bump.
Â 
Very neat and tidy.
I like.Â
2797	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-05-06	I agree. Â I liked the extra Craster info. Â Only book purists seem to hate it. Â I haven't heard any non-book readers who had a problem with it.
Â 
Also, I find it ironic that people complain Craster's is filler wasting precious screen time, while also complaining that show-only characters Karl and Locke were killed in the very same "filler" event.
Â 
Otherwise, we'd have Bran boringly talking to trees and warging his way north forever.
2798	Dorne Sand	2014-05-06	I know there is a thread already on Craster's as filler, but I wanted to tie it into some bigger threads that are not covered there, and probably would be lost in the 7+ pages of post already there (as it's degenerated currently into the efficacy of Valyrian steel against bone).

Most likely, the battle itself will be condensed, the attack from the front will coincide with the attack from the south, and while the Night's Watch will defeat the Thenns + Tormund, Stannis will show up just in time to break the main wildling attack from the north. To accomplish this, there needed to be action in Jon Snow's story that can at least be claimed to delay the attack, as without the mutineers, apparently Mance cannot learn that the Night's Watch is weak. I do not recall if in the show they mentioned Mance coming to Winterfell to see King Robert in the flesh, but if they haven't, I doubt they will because he obviously would have determined the state of the Night's Watch's strength at that point.

Jon's knowledge of Bran's survival
	Spoiler They get to have Sam both to be a loyal friend to Jon rather than hold to vows and words. This will lead more easily to a sexual relationship with Gilly and his eventual rescue of her and child from Moletown. Having Jon get the catharsis of cleaning out Craster's Keep, after it has been identified as the one possible location for Bran to have stopped by that they might find him, means that he can set that to rest for the moment. Or, they could recycle it later and omit the Hardhome ranging in favor of Jon using his power as eventual Lord Commander to organize a ranging to "rescue" Bran.

Appease modern feminists
	Spoiler There's been a lot of rape and removal of women's agency recently. Having a Crasterwife save Jon, then them strike off on their own direction (perhaps they could combine the elder Crasterwife with Mother Mole if they DO want to have Hardhome happen later?) will do much to pay lipservice to feminism.

Justify Jon's reputation with Night's Watch rank and file
	Spoiler The viewers have ample reason to root for Jon Snow. Most of the Night's Watch would only know him as a bastard born of traitor's stock who was resentful of his appointment as Mormont's steward, his preferential treatment in being able to range with Qhorin Halfhand, and then joining the wildlings after killing the Halfhand, who was revered. Then he comes back full of arrows, and pronounces his oathbreaking. A successful return from the difficult sortie to Craster's Keep will justify his reputation in their eyes and undermine Thorne's position when it comes time to elect a new Lord Commander. This is done quietly without much exploration of Night's Watch politics, as the show has less time to devote to that.

Increase the Crannogmen's importance without storytelling
	Spoiler Meera is severely undermined in this arc, as viewers cannot take her seriously as a huntress. She was surprised by the mutineers, and the next episode they were slaughtered like drunken pigs. So the tradeoff was to make them more mystic by showing Jojenvision to the audience. Jojenvision becomes the necessary guide for Bran. Meera, however, is presently superfluous. She will prove essential in a few episodes, but she has to climb back of the uselessness hole the writers put her into. It is also very unlikely that the Reeds will tell the story of the Knight of the Laughing Tree, but if they do, it will be because they traded Meera's worldly know-how for making her a keeper of lore.

Direct Bran north in a very specific way without Coldhands
	Spoiler Jojenvision shows them the way North, which will be expedited and finish by the end of the season, sans Coldhands. Incidentally, it alludes to Jojen's potential death when Bran gets north.

Set up a causus belli for the Boltons against Jon Snow without Farya
	Spoiler The Bastard of Bolton has less exploration in the show than in the books, despite being explored earlier. And it looks like the Winterfell marriage arc is unlikely to happen as written - they can dodge the necessity of it by setting up a conflict between the Boltons and Jon Snow; how will Roose react when Locke does not return and Jon Snow becomes Lord Commander of the Night's Watch? He will clearly view him as an enemy even prior to (or without) the conflicts in the book when he's mucking about in Northern affairs by supporting Stannis and playing matchmaker/King in the North by interfering with the Karstark family, something that legally is the responsibility and privilege of the Warden of the North, Roose Bolton.

Clean itself up
	Spoiler Mutineers were introduced and removed. Locke was continued and removed. With the literal burning of the keep, the extra elements added in are cleaned up while the story has been springboarded along.


It's hard to say for certain if it was worthwhile, but there's absolutely an argument to be made for the expediency of storytelling, and it provided more flexibility than shows up at first blush in terms of future events for the series.
Â 


1. It could have been done with bran arc with other changes
2. could have been done otherwise, with john send to oversee battle preparation on the other side of the wall. use the time to mark how much he misses him
3. why changing the time frame? the way it is written provides ample material (battle, villages in danger and the need to pull back villagers, even some thorne vs john more politics, dialogue with aemon, sam and Other research)Â 
4. Well jon's arc is beautiful in the back without that knowledge. We can imagine many stories and arcs where he doesn't need to know
5. this one is funny as they didn't even have to poke at feminist the way they did in the first place...and after all the whoring and raping that has been done in the first seaon i think they don't give a damn about feminists
6. stick to the original will have done the same. Make it a figth over what should be done with the villagers south of the wall and an opposition between thorne and jon, make it about the cleverness of the preparation of the battle to come against the thens, about the obligation of training even the builders an stewards, make it about and young and rebelious jon vs a hatefull and straigthforward thorne. Make it about jon redeeming himself from his oathbreaking and put his efforts to the ground with a pompous arrival of janos slynt
7. they just managed the contrary as you state it very well for meera. even jojen is diminished but for his moment against the mutineers where he is the true guide not just a simple reminder of bran's own vision
8. jojen abilities in bran arc should have been enougth
9. I'am ok with introducing locke for this purpose but create a full sum zero arc ? surely there was another way
Â 
For this arc to exist they had to propose a scenario where jon think of aÂ  very stupid reason to go north of the wall motivated by a major info he doesn't have compared to the book which allisters agrees to, when they obviously lack the men to handle the wildlings coming and let him have enougth men where is plan is to get him killed. They made an impropable scenario of a chained ghost a trap for summer and bran meera jojen captured when they have a greenseer with them, at the exact same time of the attack of jon on the mutineers.
Â 
even if they needed what you have listed (and there are some very valid points just ike the jon/bolton tension), they botched it in my opinion. It is not about the changes or the additionnal arc. Is it about how he is brougth to the screen the plots that motivate it, its realism. The lack of emotions of jon knowing about bran info which is brougth off screen!, the absence of gost in any interaction of jon at the wall. he could have mentionned it to sam that he missed him no?
Â 
Since joffrey death, nothing happens really much in kings landing. But we get to see new interactions and dialogues even a bit twisted. and it is interesting and funny. I think that the same could have been done at the wall. and if you need some action for bran, gods they are wildlings, undead, others there even some rogue NW, surely there was something else to do rigth if you felt compelled to add some action? but why adding some action at all? Yes his trip is boring but kind of peotic also to watch him going to his doom in this oppressive and dangerous north. then you'll tell me that it doesn't work on screen. Tell peter jackson who has to screen the whole frodon trip which is one of the most boring until they arrive in mordor
2799	David Selig	2014-05-06	How exactly did showing a few more pointless rape scenes and naked breasts was really appeasing to feminists. Because at the end the women made the idiotic choice to burn the keep and (supposedly) all the supplies there and somehow survive in the wilderness with the Others and Mance's army coming? This doesn't make sense.
2800	Darryk	2014-05-06	Agree with all the reasons given.
Â 
On a character and story development level, it strengthened Jon's leadership position, fleshed out Bran and Jojen's relationship and showed Bran's strengthening resolve.
Â 
On an entertainment level we got a great performance form Burn Gorman, a cool sword-fighting sequence, and Hodor breaking a guy's neck.
Â 
And it brought Jon and Ghost back together, which is always a good thing.
Â 
Also, since GRRM keeps going on about how the show runners sometimes kill off characters who aren't dead in the books, it was the first time in awhile that I've genuinely feared for characters; wasn't entirely sure Meera was going to survive the captivity. (I knew they wouldn't kill off any of the others yet)
2801	AzorAhai42	2014-05-06	I agree with almost everything you said, but I think you're holding Jojenvision in too high of a regard. It was established in episode 2 that Bran can use the Weirwoods to inform him of his next move.Â
2802	ViennaGirl	2014-05-06	How exactly did showing a few more pointless rape scenes and naked breasts was really appeasing to feminists. Because at the end the women made the idiotic choice to burn the keep and (supposedly) all the supplies there and somehow survive in the wilderness with the Others and Mance's army coming?

Â Sigh. Yes, this.
Â 
Also, "paying lipservice to modern feminists?" (from the original post) Paying lipservice means that you don't really mean it - you're just checking a box. I don't think that would be HBO's goal. They'd either want to actually acknowledge a feminist viewpoint (which they often do in this show, because the source material is arguably fairly feminist) or not, but I don't think anyone would have the goal of paying lipservice to feminism.Â
2803	Chebyshov	2014-05-06	Well put, OP. Two things though:
Â 
3. You're 100% right here, but I think this is the biggest misstep of the producers. They wanted an episode 9 battle, but they're using a battle that I just don't think fits that role so well. So while I don't really have an issue with the Craster's arc, I do have an issue with Jon's post-battle chapters being slopped together in one episode.Â 
Â 
5. I raise you a Crasterwife stabbing Karl with the most problematic depiction of rape yet.
2804	Fat Trell	2014-05-06	I like all the pieces in this arc. I just don't like how they were arranged. It heavy-handedly solved the Jon competence problem, which was very much a show creation.
I don't understand the point of filler that is solved so quickly. If the goal is to kill time, why not have the mutineers stick around as a plot device? Why kill off Locke before he has any real impact on Jon or his storyline?
2805	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-06	I agree. Â I liked the extra Craster info. Â Only book purists seem to hate it. Â I haven't heard any non-book readers who had a problem with it.
Â 
Also, I find it ironic that people complain Craster's is filler wasting precious screen time, while also complaining that show-only characters Karl and Locke were killed in the very same "filler" event.
Â 
Otherwise, we'd have Bran boringly talking to trees and warging his way north forever.


Â 
truer than you know...some unsullied i know who hated Oathkeeper, absolutely LOVED this ep, specifically for Caster's...hey D&D need a wider focus group than just book readers and they clearly know how to keep things lively to attract everyone...i have mixed feelings about the scene but by no means did i hate it... i agree with the person who started this thread on most of the points...
Â 
if they showed Jon and Bran meeting, then i would have been right along everyone else screaming for D&D's heads, that would have been tooooo much...
Â 
as it stands, IMO no really significant change...and no one can deny the scene was entertaining (HODOR, warging, jojen hand fire, jon's fighting, karl's epic dialogues and so forth)...it was good TV which is good enough for me
2806	Envie	2014-05-06	Â Sigh. Yes, this.
Â 
Also, "paying lipservice to modern feminists?" (from the original post) Paying lipservice means that you don't really mean it - you're just checking a box. I don't think that would be HBO's goal. They'd either want to actually acknowledge a feminist viewpoint (which they often do in this show, because the source material is arguably fairly feminist) or not, but I don't think anyone would have the goal of paying lipservice to feminism.Â 


Â 
Yeah lets please not take the conversation in a 'feminist' argument direction. As a female who enjoys the books and the show very much and has absolutely no problem with the presence of 'whores' and nudity / sex scenes in the show - I don't really want to hear the term "lip service" being flung out there casually when as pointed out - there are tons of great feminine role models in the story defying the odds stacked against females in this harshly male dominated fantasy world. Arya Stark, Daenarys Targaryen, Asha Greyjoy, Brienne of Tarth and yes, even Sansa Stark or Cersei Lannister / Margaery Tyrell could be argued as great female icons for their ability to play the 'game of thrones' in the limited capacity they've been given it.
Â 
That being said, I think I understand the original intentions meant by the remark. As the writers pointed out in the 'inside the episode' video - there's powerful symbolism in having the women of Craster's Keep watch it burn to the ground and survive / triumph over 'evil' even if they're now faced with even greater perils ahead on their own. It was symbolism for Jon Snow's leadership and what he stands for as well.
Â 
That one 'feminist lips service' remark sticking point aside, I feel the OP list is well thought out and on point with valid arguments as to why the Craster's Keep story arc was useful for the show and not just pointless filler. While I still think it was done as filler to stretch out Bran's story longer (face it, there really just wasn't much for Bran to do this entire book / season other than trudge through snow and ice north of the wall) ... there's a lot more that was definitely accomplished by creating the extra characters and scenes.Â 
Â 
Because I felt the scenes were well done - great acting and action - it wasn't pointless. It was enjoyable and added to the value of the show over the books at a point in the books where things were stalling for those characters.
2807	Lord Spark of House Spark	2014-05-06	"Climb back out of the uselessness hole"
Â 
Love that phrase
2808	Harry Lime	2014-05-06	Also, it's a big character moment for Bran. He doesn't just narrowly miss Jon like at Queenscrown (which so many people are comparing it to). HeÂ choosesÂ not to go to Jon. He's fully committed to his quest now.
2809	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-06	Also, it's a big character moment for Bran. He doesn't just narrowly miss Jon like at Queenscrown (which so many people are comparing it to). HeÂ choosesÂ not to go to Jon. He's fully committed to his quest now.


Â 
  Â 
Â 
people who were upset after Oathkeeper that Jon's gona miss out on his big character moment with Stannis...well this is a big character moment for Bran...appearing to choose the good of the realm over himself and his family...
Â 
IMO, show!Bran's reasons are better than book!Bran's reasons...books he was just a kid hoping to walk again, looking for a miracle and jojen was just helping him do whatever he wanted...show, they haven't really explained his motivations so it seems like he's going to learn to be a more powerful warg and jojen's comments are making it seem like he's the last hope, that without his warging abilities, everyone is doomed..i like it!
2810	MrsManderly	2014-05-06	Great post - I'm (almost) persuaded!
Â 
OnÂ OP's item 9:Â  I don't think this plot is toÂ needed for a JS/Bolton animosity since I'm pretty sure they willÂ be bringingÂ Farya into the show.Â  The talk earlier in the season between Brienne and Jaime and, more to the point, between Roos and Ramsay, about Arya being presumed dead and a Stark being needed to legitimise the claim to Winterfell hints heavily towardsÂ that +Â  to lose Farya wouldÂ detract fundamentally from Reek's arc and possibly have other implications on the story in TWOW
Â 
She may not be Jayne Pool but I think we will be getting Farya - early next season I would guess
2811	Hard Hugh	2014-05-06	Also, it's a big character moment for Bran. He doesn't just narrowly miss Jon like at Queenscrown (which so many people are comparing it to). HeÂ choosesÂ not to go to Jon. He's fully committed to his quest now.


Â 
I thought this was very significant as well. he made an active choice to see this through all the way. he could have been a kid again (on some level) could have had someone else take away the responsibility and decsions....but he chose to see it through alone to the end. A lot of courage and character shown here.
2812	littleRickon	2014-05-06	I think you missed one:
Â 
show that Brans warging of Hodor is problematic, and that Bran isn't just on a path into pure light and goodness.
Â 
We had the first instance of Brodoring in the Queenscrown episode, where it was a surprise pretty much for Bran as well, and where it gets painted as an achievement that very few wargs can do. In the books we have more exposition to the severity of the situation, of how Bran kind of not thinks very much about it, but if you look carefully, you can still see how he is basically violating another person for not much more than killing boredom and exploring caves. I thought how the show depicted the killing of Locke and Hodor's obvious shock and disgust was very strong in that department.
Â 
edit: epic typo

Definitely true. What he did to Hodor was very problematic and violative of Hodor's agency. Of course, it probably saved everyone's life, but it's a great moment of darkness for Bran.

Â 
I think it was one of the best ways to showcase the inherently problematic ways of Bran doing this, which we learn in the book. Taking a life was obviously a darker twist, but Locke seemed like enough of a threat to warrant it.
Â 
The big stableboy no longer fought him as he had the first time, back in the lake tower during the storm. Like a dog who has had all the fight whipped out of him, Hodor would curl up and hide whenever Bran reached out for him. His hiding place was somewhere deep within him, a pit where not even Bran could touch him. No one wants to hurt you, Hodor, he said silently, to the child-man whose flesh heâ<U+0080><U+0099>d taken. I just want to be strong again for a while. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll give it back, the way I always do.
2815	Fevre River Warrior	2014-05-06	I like these very much - good job! I think you have it right and the Craster's bit was needed for the purposes you cite above.
Â 
As a book reader I am glad the HBO writers are getting to the main story lines without all of the other paths that GRRM takes. I like to read GRRMs journeys but when it comes to the HBO series I want to see things move along. I do not think there will be a fake Arya, but I am sure the Bolton-Jon Snow conflict will happen at some point. I wonder how Bolton will find out about Locke.....and I am very glad he is dead! I wanted that character to be killed off, but thought Ghost would do it. Ghost had his own business to see to, loved seeing Bran/Hodor take care of Locke.

Â 
I think I agree with you that in some ways it's nice to see the story moving along without some of the 'dragging' areas the book possessed. There's so much dialogue from the books that just wouldn't be entertaining on television I'm sure they went with bits and pieces that would overall convey the same basic story (which this did) without changing anything from the books too drastically. Changing things up is good. I've read a lot of arguments in the 'filler' thread which I agreed with a few points and disagreed with others. After re-watching the episode and thinking about it some more, I've decided it wasn't wasted time and worked well for the show and I'm happy to have watched something new that didn't take place in the books yet still held the same flavor and even some mystery / intrigue for what's to come.
2817	ToTheWolves	2014-05-06	I know there is a thread already on Craster's as filler, but I wanted to tie it into some bigger threads that are not covered there, and probably would be lost in the 7+ pages of post already there (as it's degenerated currently into the efficacy of Valyrian steel against bone).
Â 
At first glance, the Craster's Keep arc feels like filler. Â It feels like bad writing, something glommed together perhaps to tug on heartstrings with another Stark faux-reunion. Â But bear in mind that there are a number of other things omitted from the books that have had readers feeling that there will be problems in the future. Â I wanted to write out a list of some of the things that are addressed with this arc, and what was expended to take care of them here, and how fine of a job the writers managed to do in order to clean it up as neatly as it was done. Â In no particular order:Explore the Great White North
	Spoiler Â The show writers want to remind the viewers that the Others-beyond-the-wall are an important and major threat. There is much more exposition in the book about them, and the format itself means that they are very likely to be in the readers' mind even when they are not mentioned. For show viewers, they were seen in the first episode. Next, they are seen with Craster's child in season 2, and closing off the season at the Fist of the First Men. After that, Sam kills one in season 3. That's it. Viewers have much more reason to fear the wights than the Others, as other than killing the first disposable characters the viewers meet in the first episode, they steal a baby and get killed by a fat coward (as he is presented to viewers! Don't worry, Sam's cool...), and nothing else. As such, the viewers need both to be reminded of their existence AND be convinced of the severity of their threat. Using Craster's last son provides this opportunity.
Bring Ghost back to Jon
	Spoiler Ghost went missing in the first half of Season 3. Perhaps viewers largely forgot about him, but they needed a way to bring him back to Jon without having him randomly show up at the northern gate of Castle Black or scale the Wall by himself.
Delay wildling attack on the Wall
	Spoiler They've moved around some of the occurrences surrounding the battle at the Wall, but both with Stannis going to Braavos and Jon's early return, as well as his being judged by Janos Slynt and Alliser Thorne prior to the attack from the south. Most likely, the battle itself will be condensed, the attack from the front will coincide with the attack from the south, and while the Night's Watch will defeat the Thenns + Tormund, Stannis will show up just in time to break the main wildling attack from the north. To accomplish this, there needed to be action in Jon Snow's story that can at least be claimed to delay the attack, as without the mutineers, apparently Mance cannot learn that the Night's Watch is weak. I do not recall if in the show they mentioned Mance coming to Winterfell to see King Robert in the flesh, but if they haven't, I doubt they will because he obviously would have determined the state of the Night's Watch's strength at that point.
Jon's knowledge of Bran's survival
	Spoiler They get to have Sam both to be a loyal friend to Jon rather than hold to vows and words. This will lead more easily to a sexual relationship with Gilly and his eventual rescue of her and child from Moletown. Having Jon get the catharsis of cleaning out Craster's Keep, after it has been identified as the one possible location for Bran to have stopped by that they might find him, means that he can set that to rest for the moment. Or, they could recycle it later and omit the Hardhome ranging in favor of Jon using his power as eventual Lord Commander to organize a ranging to "rescue" Bran.
Appease modern feminists
	Spoiler There's been a lot of rape and removal of women's agency recently. Having a Crasterwife save Jon, then them strike off on their own direction (perhaps they could combine the elder Crasterwife with Mother Mole if they DO want to have Hardhome happen later?) will do much to pay lipservice to feminism.
Justify Jon's reputation with Night's Watch rank and file
	Spoiler The viewers have ample reason to root for Jon Snow. Most of the Night's Watch would only know him as a bastard born of traitor's stock who was resentful of his appointment as Mormont's steward, his preferential treatment in being able to range with Qhorin Halfhand, and then joining the wildlings after killing the Halfhand, who was revered. Then he comes back full of arrows, and pronounces his oathbreaking. A successful return from the difficult sortie to Craster's Keep will justify his reputation in their eyes and undermine Thorne's position when it comes time to elect a new Lord Commander. This is done quietly without much exploration of Night's Watch politics, as the show has less time to devote to that.
Increase the Crannogmen's importance without storytelling
	Spoiler Meera is severely undermined in this arc, as viewers cannot take her seriously as a huntress. She was surprised by the mutineers, and the next episode they were slaughtered like drunken pigs. So the tradeoff was to make them more mystic by showing Jojenvision to the audience. Jojenvision becomes the necessary guide for Bran. Meera, however, is presently superfluous. She will prove essential in a few episodes, but she has to climb back of the uselessness hole the writers put her into. It is also very unlikely that the Reeds will tell the story of the Knight of the Laughing Tree, but if they do, it will be because they traded Meera's worldly know-how for making her a keeper of lore.
Direct Bran north in a very specific way without Coldhands
	Spoiler Jojenvision shows them the way North, which will be expedited and finish by the end of the season, sans Coldhands. Incidentally, it alludes to Jojen's potential death when Bran gets north.
Set up a causus belli for the Boltons against Jon Snow without Farya
	Spoiler The Bastard of Bolton has less exploration in the show than in the books, despite being explored earlier. And it looks like the Winterfell marriage arc is unlikely to happen as written - they can dodge the necessity of it by setting up a conflict between the Boltons and Jon Snow; how will Roose react when Locke does not return and Jon Snow becomes Lord Commander of the Night's Watch? He will clearly view him as an enemy even prior to (or without) the conflicts in the book when he's mucking about in Northern affairs by supporting Stannis and playing matchmaker/King in the North by interfering with the Karstark family, something that legally is the responsibility and privilege of the Warden of the North, Roose Bolton.
Clean itself up
	Spoiler Mutineers were introduced and removed. Locke was continued and removed. With the literal burning of the keep, the extra elements added in are cleaned up while the story has been springboarded along.
It's hard to say for certain if it was worthwhile, but there's absolutely an argument to be made for the expediency of storytelling, and it provided more flexibility than shows up at first blush in terms of future events for the series.

Gimme a break. Â Show!Bran is a selfish prick who apparently doesn't care at all that Jon is likely to risk his live venturing north to find and save him. Â Brook!Bran at least had the decency to keep his survival a secret.
2819	A Raven	2014-05-06	How exactly did showing a few more pointless rape scenes and naked breasts was really appeasing to feminists. Because at the end the women made the idiotic choice to burn the keep and (supposedly) all the supplies there and somehow survive in the wilderness with the Others and Mance's army coming? This doesn't make sense.The added scenes permit a catharsis. Never underestimate the unconscious value of building up rancor and releasing it. As for their plan to burn down the keep and strike off on their own, I laughed at the show when I heard the elder Crasterwife say that.Regarding "lipservice", all I'll say is that I deliberately labelled it that, as there are many better, subtler examples of strong women than the hamhanded clichA© approach taken in this story. It's a lipservice because it has the image of female empowerment and is held up as a beacon of that by the writers, but Sansa in this very episode was much better at that without much fanfare by very slyly playing the "helpless, weak little girl" to Lysa Tully-Arryn-Baelish.I think you missed one:Â show that Brans warging of Hodor is problematic, and that Bean isn't just on a path into pure light and goodness.Â We had the first instance of Brodoring in the Queenscrown episode, where it was a surprise pretty much for Bran as well, and where it gets painted as an achievement that very few wargs can do. In the books we have more exposition to the severity of the situation, of how Bran kind of not thinks very much about it, but if you look carefully, you can still see how he is basically violating another person for not much more than killing boredom and exploring caves. I thought how the show depicted the killing of Locke and Hodor's obvious shock and disgust was very strong in that department.Definitely true - also great acting by Kristian Nairn to express Hodor's horror and revulsion at what Bran had done using his hands. The pacifist manslayer...Â I agree with almost everything you said, but I think you're holding Jojenvision in too high of a regard. It was established in episode 2 that Bran can use the Weirwoods to inform him of his next move.While true, Jojenvision is more portable than weirwoods and can be used in a less contrived fashion.Â Â I like all the pieces in this arc. I just don't like how they were arranged. It heavy-handedly solved the Jon competence problem, which was very much a show creation.I don't understand the point of filler that is solved so quickly. If the goal is to kill time, why not have the mutineers stick around as a plot device? Why kill off Locke before he has any real impact on Jon or his storyline?They definitely could have done more, but space is limited with 10-episode seasons and the massive cast.Â  This episode had no Stannis or Davos; what would you sacrifice to give more screentime to Locke and the mutineers? It'd be a hard and costly choice no matter what they do. It's easy to pass judgment now, but ultimately we have to see how it plays out at the end, once all the seasons have run and all the books have been published.Â   Â Â people who were upset after Oathkeeper that Jon's gona miss out on his big character moment with Stannis...well this is a big character moment for Bran...appearing to choose the good of the realm over himself and his family...Â Also valid - unlike with Arya, unlike with Queenscrown, this is the first Stark reunion that is deliberately avoided by a Stark deciding not to meet up.Â Great post - I'm (almost) persuaded!Â OnÂ OP's item 9:Â  I don't think this plot is toÂ needed for a JS/Bolton animosity since I'm pretty sure they willÂ be bringingÂ Farya into the show.Â  The talk earlier in the season between Brienne and Jaime and, more to the point, between Roos and Ramsay, about Arya being presumed dead and a Stark being needed to legitimise the claim to Winterfell hints heavily towardsÂ that +Â  to lose Farya wouldÂ detract fundamentally from Reek's arc and possibly have other implications on the story in TWOWÂ She may not be Jayne Pool but I think we will be getting Farya - early next season I would guessIt's possible, but they've spent too much time making Arya's "death" too public. Again, with the limited screentime, if they can set up the conflict through conventional politics alone, they may very well opt for that. The timing would have to be tight, however, as they have to send Farya to the Boltons prior to Tywin's death (episode 9 or 10, the earliest would be the last scene of episode 8), but after Ramsay has been legitimized (they COULD have Ramsay take Moat Cailin next episode, but even then he wouldn't get legitimized until the next episode. So there's a range of episode 7-9 to introduce Farya, at the same time as they have the Battle at the Wall, Oberyn vs. the Mountain, the politics of the Harpy, Jorah's fall from grace, and whatever else they make fit into that time. A tough order!). My money is on the omission.

I understand that. But then why add filler at all? The argument doesn't work two ways; you can't be pressed for time but also have to invent irrelevant things to kill time.

The argument doesn't work two ways; you can't be pressed for time but also have to invent irrelevant things to kill time.The origin of this thread was that the Craster's arc is not filler, but replaced the function of multiple omitted parts of the story, and does so in less screentime than showing those omitted parts would have taken. Not necessarily better storytelling, but more efficient, as the format demands.

I think this is true, however I do feel that we will be scrambling for filler in a seasons time.
Â 
The problem with the books is there are so many characters. When you translate that to Television, that means there are lots of hired actors. Actors that have contracts. We are nearing a point in the books where certain characters start to drop off. Bran is one of them. His chapters arent as exciting and his overall story could be told in 20 minutes. He walks north job done.
Â 
They have to extend that journey to cover X chapters. If they speed that up to quickly they throw the timeline out massively. If the book material is not substantial enough to fill those gaps with meaningful television time the viewers get bored. If an actor has a contract he is getting paid for X appearances or is contracted for X dollars for the entire season, they want to get their monies worth and they also cannot risk having main characters off television for a long period of time otherwise the risk of their story dieing becomes very real. The other issue is you want your actors to be committed to the show. Guess why NCW is getting lots of television time? Because he was probably offered other roles and HBO couldnt have him comitting to other projects. How about we entice you to stay with GoT if we give you more episodes which means more cash.
Â 
They give Jon Snow and Bran filler here that fulfills that goal.
Â 
Secondly, this current season is CRAMMED with events. The next book, meh. Smart television would be to pad this season out a little leaving some events for next season where the book becomes a little dry. I think we as book readers need to not think of each season as book 1 book 2 etc because each book does not have equal content. I think next season we will be seeing lots more filler as the producers start to pad the more boring chapters out a bit as well as buy some time for Old Mate George.
Â 
I think this "filler" was completely justified. Sure it created some glaring plot holes. But at the same time, it introduced the television viewers to the Others again, refreshing their memory that Dany and her Dragons is not the threat that Westeros needs to be worried about. It created some drama for Bran in an otherwise SNORE of a story. It gave Jon Snow some credential as a leader and a fighter. It tied up the Craster storyline. It returned Ghost to Jon. It showed off Jojens Greenseer abilities some more and it brought some time for the Wildings attack and Stannis to go get a loan from the iron bank.

2823	Hagen of Tronje	2014-05-07	I don't really mind the idea of Bran and Co. running into the mutineers, because it provides an opportunity to show what happened there after Sam left the place, adds some action to a rather dull storyline and also provides a way of reminding the audience about the Others.
Â 
Using Jon and his volunteers as liberators (instead of Coldhands for example) and throwing in Locke as an unsuccessfull assassin however is mostly filler (and Locke's death is a waste). Yes, there are some positive narrative aspects, but they could have done it otherwise without using so much screentime and creating so many plotholes. After the mutineers are killed, almost everyone is in the same situation as before, so it hardly adds anything to the storylines. I'm not sure how the big battle will turn out in episode 9, but at the moment I don't think it was a good idea to push back the attack on Castle Black from the south as well as cutting Coldhands. Because the whole Craster's Keep mess is a result of that.
2824	shiola	2014-05-07	Â 
Yeah lets please not take the conversation in a 'feminist' argument direction. As a female who enjoys the books and the show very much and has absolutely no problem with the presence of 'whores' and nudity / sex scenes in the show - I don't really want to hear the term "lip service" being flung out there casually when as pointed out - there are tons of great feminine role models in the story defying the odds stacked against females in this harshly male dominated fantasy world. Arya Stark, Daenarys Targaryen, Asha Greyjoy, Brienne of Tarth and yes, even Sansa Stark or Cersei Lannister / Margaery Tyrell could be argued as great female icons for their ability to play the 'game of thrones' in the limited capacity they've been given it.
Â 
That being said, I think I understand the original intentions meant by the remark. As the writers pointed out in the 'inside the episode' video - there's powerful symbolism in having the women of Craster's Keep watch it burn to the ground and survive / triumph over 'evil' even if they're now faced with even greater perils ahead on their own. It was symbolism for Jon Snow's leadership and what he stands for as well.
Â 
That one 'feminist lips service' remark sticking point aside, I feel the OP list is well thought out and on point with valid arguments as to why the Craster's Keep story arc was useful for the show and not just pointless filler. While I still think it was done as filler to stretch out Bran's story longer (face it, there really just wasn't much for Bran to do this entire book / season other than trudge through snow and ice north of the wall) ... there's a lot more that was definitely accomplished by creating the extra characters and scenes.Â 
Â 
Because I felt the scenes were well done - great acting and action - it wasn't pointless. It was enjoyable and added to the value of the show over the books at a point in the books where things were stalling for those characters.


Â 
100000% This. Â Well said. Â And, OP, thank you very much for this post.

What plot holes did it create? That term is thrown around so much on these boards. Â A plot hole is not when the story does something that people may deem pointless or ineffective. Â A plot hole has to do with logic within the story-- either the characters' logic or the logic of the universe itself.
2826	Aerys Blackfyre	2014-05-08	Craster's keep arson = the biggest fire the North has ever seen = Thormund will interpret it as the signal to attack Castle Black
2827	JagLover	2014-05-08	Book readers seem to mainly consider it filler as it was not in the books, but from a show perspective it was anything but.
Â 
Jon Snow finally had a chance to prove himself and his election as LC will be allot more plausible now.
Â 
Bran's storyline also underwent a drastic development with him warging into Hodor to kill a man (perhaps something that will happen later in the books?)
Â 
Aside from the above they reminded us of the existence and threat of the others, added some much needed interest to the Bran storyline and added a bit of action in a section of the show devoid of it otherwise.

This usually happens as a result of people using what they've read in the books to contextualize what's happening in the show. It's basically a kind of cognitive dissonance. But yeah, mostly people just don't know what a plot-hole is. Or white-washing, for that matter.Â
2831	Roose Boltons Pet Leech	2014-05-08	Apart from various oddities (where are Craster's wives going to go? Are we seeming Hardhome moved forward?), I'm OK with the Crasters Keep adventure. It adds interest to Bran's storyline, and makes Jon are more realistic candidate for Lord Commander. TV!Jon is far more active (and thus interesting) than passive Book!Jon.
2832	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-08	It's only filler if you've read the books and know it doesn't happen there. 
From tv point of view it's not filler really.
2833	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-08	How exactly did showing a few more pointless rape scenes and naked breasts was really appeasing to feminists.

This doesn't make sense.Yeah, having a hard time taking the OP seriously after that one ridiculous point.
Unnecessary repeated rape scenes to fill the boob quota and redundantly try to prove how eeeeevil karl is (as if his Villain Voice, Evil Speeches and Drinking from Skulls didnt get the message across) is one of the most UNfeminist parts of this whole show. It REALLY got to me on this occasion because it was SO OBVIOUS at one point it was there to fill boob quota.
2834	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-08	Thing is, I agreed with all the other points, just NOT THAT ONE.

Give them some credit.Â  They've been oppressed their entire life and are quite uneducated and inbred.Â  They don't want to stay in their current hell-hole.Â  They don't want to risk going along with more NW, half of whom are on the wall because they were convicted rapists, and so far the wildlings, wights, and Others have left them alone, albeit they need some pregnancies to keep up that protection. They're picking the lesser of two evils; and quite honestly, they probably have a back-up plan - a cave or something with lots of food.Â  I could totally see them heading to Hardhome later on, anyway.

Â 
wooooooooooooooooow, I didn't see that! I love it, and I salute you for finding it. I think the show forums would benefit so much if people committed their attention to finding these new subtle points and moments of foreshadowing instead of just looking for the ones that we already know from the books. Well done, sir or ma'am!
2837	Frey Pies	2014-05-08	In my opinion, the greatest benefit of adding it was that it was extremely entertaining. All your points are valid, of course (except maybe the feminist one) and things I've argued about with countless book readers over the internet, but that is the most important reason.
Â 
Jon would literally have had nothing to do till episode 9, and Bran, as usual, would just keep trudging through the woods. This provided a nice change in pace for both, and, in my opinion, is one of the best sequences of the entire show. I've said this many times on the site, but the Jojen vision sequence, ending with "You'll know", is my favourite scene in the series thus far.
Â 
All that matters is that I was more entertained with TV than I've been in a long time. This season has been killing it, and I loved that scene
2838	tsarrast	2014-05-08	lots of good points made here.
Â 
I think it's important to remember that the show will deviate from the books - and it's necessary to do so for many reasons already listed in this thread...
1) keeping the main actors involved
2) more efficiently telling the story
- are probably the two primary ones that fuel changes
Â 
I think a lot of the changes that are made are fine and make for entertaining television as well as a more compact story that works. Â In fact, the #1 thing I didn't like from this season was the Jamie rape - which came not as much from changing the original story, but just from bad direction or writing of the scene. Â That scene should have been more obviously consensual, as it needlessly and violently ruined Jamie's character arc - to the point that I'm personally just replacing what happened in the show with what happened in the books in order to not be constantly frustrated.
Â 
But otherwise, I see a lot of merit behind the shows changes... it was an entertaining way to have a lot more screen time with Bran/Jon and accomplish a lot of important points (already listed). Â It also reset things now to being more similar to the books (Bran still going north without contact with JOn - which btw I knew was going to happen somehow in that scene ... direwolves returned to owners ... show-only characters killed)
Â 
At this point, it's clear the show is not a direct exposition of the books - nor do i believe it should be. Â Accept the changes, and take the show for what it is - very well done television that is being reasonably faithful to the books, all things considered.

Â 
Hahaha indeed it felt right to have a bit of agency given to those helpless women. Those two last episodes were really difficult to watch because of the sexual violence. I also liked what Cercei said, "they hurt little girls everywhere". It's food for thoughts (maybe for people who think that the violence is acceptable because it's "just a fiction" although it happens in the real world at this very moment too)
2840	acosta	2014-05-08	I really don't think Craster's wives are in any danger from the Others now that we know they aren't just mindless killing machines. There's no reason they can't show some gratitude and at least some of them are their sons besides.Â 
Â 
That said, if they really did burn the keep without taking all of the useful supplies and food from it first, that was a pretty stupid move, but as Gilly proved to Sam, they know how to live in the wilderness.Â
2841	Raffles	2014-05-09	All this talk of Craster's Keep being "filler" is just crazy talk. As if D&D have got a spare second to "fill".. let alone 15 minutes per episode! Every single scene is there for a reason.. not just for that episode, but with regards to the season AND the whole series. When GoT is complete and you watch the seasons again, from start to finish (over a week or two hopefully!), you'll see how everything falls into place, with regards to the bigger picture. A scene that you thought was filler or out of place in episode 3 of season 2, may well make everything fall into place (regarding a character's arc), in episode 9 of season 5. You just need to stand back and appreciate the bigger picture.

Exactly. I remember reading all those comments about disgruntled fans in Season 3 who were complaining nothing was happening- they hadn't realized that the entire season building towards the Red Wedding.Â Game of Thrones is about the bigger picture. This is why I roll my eyes when I hear "professional critics" complain about filler- there is no such thing as filler in Game of Thrones.
2843	RedShirt47	2014-05-09	I agree with the OP, apart from the "Appease modern feminists" bit.
Â 
The season would be sagging in the middle without some action. Adapting a literature narrative to a visual one does need to make some changes. I thought these scenes were great.
A non reader friend emailed me about those scenes and he rarely comments on the show. I remember the complaints last year that the pacing was too slow, so I think adding some action this year was a good move.
Â 
I am viewing this as a tv show and not a summary of the books. Far too often tv/movie adaptations are simply a few key scenes put on film and it doesn't feel like a story in it's own right. I felt this way with Harry Potter.

Â 
The majority of folks here have read the books multiple times, so almost no one had failed to realize that the entire season was building toward the RW. Â Some people were simply smart enough to realize that much of the screen time was dedicated to boring conversations and pointless events which had nothing to do with the RW (or anything at all).
2845	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-05-09	Does the fact that Jon's squad consisted of volunteers undermine the justification of his stature within the NW? Â The people who were there to witness his leadership are the ones who were already on his side...
2846	Uldra I	2014-05-09	Once again going to start with the statement, I sincerely love the shows.Â The writers, cast, crew, artists, directors.... everyone involved with the shows have done an amazing job!Â  Can't even imagine how they do it all.Â  'Brilliant' is the word that comes to mind whenÂ I think of all the amazing talents that have lent theirÂ hands to the production of the entire series.Â  Also realizing there are changes that have to happen because of the difference in mediums.Â  IMO until the last two episodes, the changes seemed necessary and wise, but not ones that really change Martin's story too much.Â Â 
Â 
Realizing that most people who post on internet forums are much younger than I am, I suppose the action scenes would probably suit their tastes better than intrigue and character developmentÂ so I canÂ somewhat understand the overwhelming love of the Craster's Keep scenes in the last two episodes.Â  The moreÂ blood and sexual violence the better, right?Â  In the books Coldhands is a much beloved and very mysterious figure.Â  There could have been a couple of interesting scenes with him to flesh out the Bran arc a little.Â  CH could have even included the scene where he mutineers (who are wights by then) in an off the scene moment from the books, & there would be the fight with the wights in order to get Bran into the cave... a very exciting scene, but didn't include rape or even nudity, a limitation for some, I know.Â  Jon has lots of negotiating and relationship building to do at the wall.Â  There are lots of things in the books that could make this storyline interesting enough for the show... still no violence or even nudity,Â  sorry to say.
Â 
Just gotta say:Â Â  If they are going to write a new story, then D&D and whoever else is in charge of the storyline should at the very least stop implying they are trying to bring GRRM's story to screen.Â  They should just change the name of the series, and give GRRM credit for being an inspiration, and go their merry way with the rest of the story.
Â 
I cannot agree that what ever they make up between the beginning and the end of GRRM's series is acceptable as long as they reach the same end point.Â  What an absurd and ridiculous argument.Â Â I will not be the same story if they tell a different story. Period.Â  Not saying the show is FUBAR yet, but just saying, this kind of disregard for the original story is playing it awfully close to that edge.

Â 
They did, GRRM's series is called "A Song of Ice and Fire". The tv series is called Game of Thrones. Which is an adaptation not a summary. So far for all the changes have been fine, apart from the Sept scene with Jaime and Cersei which I think was a misstep.
I think the Craster scenes were better than Bran & co trudging through the snow (with or without Coldhands). Jon Snow got something to do. The series had some action in the middle. No harm done.

Â I was curious to know what you guys think the remainder of Season 4 has in store for her. Specifically, I was thinking about the shows introduction of Lady Stoneheart as it relates to Brienne, and how/when these two stories will meet up/be introduced in the show. Â I thought they would introduce Stoneheart at the end of Season 3, but that didn't happen, so I really think/hope it could be at the end of this season, returning to the use of the supernatural for the season finale like they did in the first two seasons (much stronger finales, in my opinion, than last year). Â Then again, episode 10 is titled "Children" (or something like that), so that would be the finale's supernatural quota right there. Â Could they introduce both the children of the forest and lady stoneheart in the finale?
Â 
So back to my original question, if Lady Stoneheart is introduced in the books when the Brotherhood saves Brienne, and Brienne is just now embarking on her journey to search for Sansa, and we are already half way through the season, how is this going to play out? Â The way I see it, Brienne still needs to go to Maidenpool, the Whispers, and the Saltpans/Quiet Isles before she is captured and meets Stoneheart. Â I think the Quiet Isles will be cut (no reason, just a feeling), but I will be extremely disappointed if Maidenpool and the Whispers don't make it into the show. Â What do you guys think? Â Will D&D respect her story line and let it play out? Â  Will we make it to Lady Stoneheart this season? Â
2852	joachim	2014-05-11	We know from "The North Remembers" that that stretch of road Brienne and Pod were traveling is near King's Landing. That suggests that they're still in the Crownlands. I would imagine that it would take weeks to get to the Inn at the Crossroads, and they still have to cross the wartorn Riverlands. I'm thinking that they can't get there this season, but who knows?
2853	LizBe	2014-05-11	From all the experiences I had with the show, I'm sure her journey will be cut a lot - ok, better saying, adapted. I do think that Maindenpool and the Whispers have good chances in being in the show, but they'l probably change the scenario.And I bet everything that Hyle Hunt will not appear. I suppose we will know in the episode of the next week, in which [show spoiler??]

	Spoiler  she and Pod will be following a new clue. There's also the fact that Brienne is gonna have that fight in which she chops someone's ear off, but as it won't be with Vargo/Locke, I have absolutely no clue who will take his place.
Â 
I also think that the greatest way to end this season would be with her meeting with Stoneheart, but that would chop A LOT of her arc and also Jaime's in a way, she'd have nothing to do unless they already use material from the Winds in the next season. I think the last scene this year will have Stoneheart hanging some Freys.

Didn't she say that it would take weeks for her to get to the Wall? That line did make me laugh.

Â 
Locke got to Castle Black in no time at all from the Dreadfought and he wouldn't have had the benefit of having easy access to the Kings Road. The distance between the Dreadfought to the Wall is around the same length as the crow flys as Kings Landing is to the Crossroad Inn. Difference is the Kings Road leads stright to the Crossroads Inn. You would have to travel miles just to get to the Kingsroad from the Dreadfought. Source
Â 
I wouldn't use distance in the show as a indication of how long it should take a character to arrive some where.

Â 
I believe that she won't go to the Quiet Isle, because she really doesn't need to in the show. They aren't limited to the POV structure, so whenever they need to update the audience on what's going on with Sandor, they can do it in a number of other ways. Brienne "knowing" that Sandor is "dead" may not even be important to what she does later.
2857	Harry Lime	2014-05-05	Does anyone think they'll go to Hardhome, and the main one who was talking to Jon at the end is Mother Mole?
2858	Lord Alistair	2014-05-06	Haha Yeah I had the same gut feeling seeing her talk at the end. Would be cool if it is.

2863	Carl Drogo	2014-05-06	I do think it's a little strange that Jon simply let them go. Somebody pointed this out in a thread on the imdb boards yesterday.
Â 
Going with the story, it's not unlikely that Karl and his men talked about what things would be like back at the wall, once the remainder got back, including a mention of the fact that there was hardly anybody left. Since preventing Karl and his men from telling Mance there's only 100 men left at the wall was the singular reason for Jon to go on his fieldtrip, it's not altogether unlikely that Craster's wives might have overheard something to the effect. It may have also been mentioned when Mormont was still alive. Since Craster's wives will almost certainly come across parts of the wildling army, it doesn't seem like a good idea to just let them go.
2864	Gurthnar	2014-05-06	I do think it's a little strange that Jon simply let them go. Somebody pointed this out in a thread on the imdb boards yesterday.

Â 
Absolutely seconded.
Â 
As I see it, they basically have 2 choices - go south with Jon. Or try and find Mance.
But OMG, some of them have never left Crasters their whole lives! Even the rest has been living there for years with almost none contact (not for them at least) with the outside world. How would they know how to find Mance? It is ridiculous.
Â 
Not to mention that it seems blue-eyes are camping just around the corner, waiting for next baby boy to pop out. What is supposed to happen now, with NW gone and Crasters burnt to the ground? Are they just going for an easy trek through wilderness?
Â 
Another thing that annoyed me was the burning center pillar of the building, which is shown falling in the direction of bystanders and in the next moment there is nothing lying in front of the burning house.

I hadn't considered this, but I think it is a perfect idea. Â I dont think it will be mentioned though until season 5 (if at all). Â With all of the recent changes and cuts, I wouldn't be surprised at all if Hardhome gets the ax. Â By having Crastor's wives leave though, I think first, it shows Jon's respect, and second, it leaves the door open for Hardhome should HBO decide to use it later.
2869	Envie	2014-05-06	It shows Jon respects wildlings and their choices.Â 


Â 
Exactly, good simple explanation. If Jon were to force those women to do anything against their will, then he's no better than the men they've already been abused / controlled by thus far.
Â 
He pretty much had to let them go or take them prisoner and the Night's Watch doesn't do that, it's not their job.
2870	Fevre River Warrior	2014-05-06	We may never hear of them again but I wonder if they will take the place of the wildling spearwives in the book and take up in one of the castles along the Wall. Mother Mole is another option...I hope they avoid Hardhome. Somehow I think Hardhome may not be a story line HBO adopts. Too much detail, not enough time, won't tie in with the main plot.
2871	Fat Trell	2014-05-06	Logically they should all die within a few days.
Â 
They have never ventured far from Craster's Keep, which they just burned down. They are a group of women with no apparent militant training or survival skills. There is quite literally no people around outside of Mance's army, which they don't seem to want to go to. There is virtually no game around, and considering the Show version ofÂ North of the Wall is a permanently frozen wasteland, can't be much vegetation.
Â 
Their choosing to wander off into the wilderness instead of following their sister-wife/daughter/sister/aunt/niece to a nice ice-zombie free zone screams of the writers wanting this arc to exist in a bubble. With no lasting effects onÂ anything they didn't design it to specifically do so.
Â 
But yeah, having her be Mother Mole would be a nice touch. I doubt they include that unless it is more important than it seems to be though.
2872	Envie	2014-05-06	I tried to glean some information that might be clues to whether or not Craster's lead wife would be turned into Mother Mole on the show. There's really not much info on the wiki about her - and what little we know about her - she was with Mance Rayder's army long before the wives of Craster would have gone out into the wilderness. Of course that doesn't prevent them from changing the story to match both women merged into one, they've done it before with characters on the show. Also, unless the whole Hardhome journey ends well (which we have no idea at the end of ADWD) then we have no idea if it would be important enough to even add that story to the show or not.Â

2873	Cordelia Baratheon	2014-05-06	No survival skills? How do you think they have been surviving all that time if they didn't have any survival skills?
Â 
I don't think Craster did much in the way of "helping" his women run the place. I think it's more likely they managed everything themselves while he sat around being waited on hand and foot.
Â 
They will know how to hunt and cook, make shelter, build fires. They will know as much "first aid" as it's possible to know given the circumstances. All of this is stuff they will have needed to know in order to live their day to day lives at Craster's Keep.
Â 
Jon and the Nights Watch have no duty to protect them, no authority to make them go to Castle Black. And after what they have been through I doubt anything the white walkers or the others can do to them will scare them much. Death is just death and they've been through worse.
Â 
Whether they join with Mance or not, I like how the show left them. They are actually free for the first time in their lives.
2874	ViennaGirl	2014-05-06	my first thought was that they would be the first of the spearwives to get to Castle Black, but now that I think about it, they probably don't know how to fight. the wildling women are fighters, but it's not like these women have had any experience beyond homesteading at Craster's. (of course, one of them helped kill Karl, so maybe they do know something).

Surviving horrific mental and physical torture doesn't equal an ability to hunt, forage, or survive on little to no food, water, rest, or heat. 
I doubt Craster simply sat around. He must have been pretty fearsome considering he defends his keep and women from his fellow free folk. 
They might know how to hunt, maybe. It would make more sense that Craster hunted given you don't give people you torture training on how to use weapons. This is ASOIAF so who knows. Hunting wasn't a necessity in summer either, Craster had livestock.
If I remember correctly, Gilly remarks on never being far from the Keep. 
These women are not expierenced in life in the wilderness.  Let alone in the awful conditions the land Beyond the Wall is on the show.

You're welcome but it took more wiki reading for me to really remember what happened since the Mother Mole entry doesn't say much. I'm doing a re-read of ADWD now but haven't gotten to this part of it yet. Here's the information about Hardhome. I'd totally forgotten that after Mother Mole leads the wildlings there, things go terribly bad for them so lets hope Craster's wives are not in that bunch.

Â 
Agreed. If Hardhome is in, it's likely that they'll have made their way there. Barring that, they probably died in the wilderness (either getting killed by the White Walkers, the wildlife or the elements).

We're talking about Jon Snow here, Eddard Stark's son in all the ways that matter.Â  There was no way he was going to do anything like capture or kill those women after all they had been through.
Â 
When faced with the ruthlessly pragmatic choice and the honorable one, it's pretty obvious which one he will choose.

2885	Farwynds Oceanseer	2014-05-09	Craster's wives might have a bargain with the white walkers, although I like the Mother Mole idea better, and the whole Hardhome subplot might be more important than some think. In Arya's Blind Beth chapter, she overhears sailors from Lys discussing the ships that were confiscated (along with their cargo of Hardhome slaves, who were freed) when storms drove them into Braavos. The sailors think more ships will be making for Hardhome because slaves are becoming more expensive and harder to find--ships from Lys, and likely Volantis. So the Hardhome wildlings will likely be rescued by slavers, not Jon, and end up as freedmen in Arya's and Dany's arcs, where they will perhaps transmit news of the Second Long Night and the Others to both Arya and Dany (who by then should have Tyrion on hand to confirm that Jorah's father sent a raven supporting this story back in season 2?). Having Mother Mole be played by the same actress as Craster's old wife would be a nice easter egg.Â 
Â 
Then again, you just can't expect the show's inventions to hold up under scrutiny the way GRRM's plotting does, because they usually don't.Â

Â 
You brought up a theory I read once long ago on these forums before the show came out and I had forgotten about completely. It was speculated that perhaps some of the wildlings taken as slaves at Hardhome eventually make their way to Dany after being freed because they've heard she's the "Mother" of slaves and breaker of chains, etc and once there, she hears first hand how the Others have returned which gives her the final motivation to leave Essos and head to Westeros as there's something bigger than the Iron Throne to conquer with her dragons and the prophesies etc. Â --- This has nothing to do with Craster's wives unless THEY are the ones to find Dany and join team Targaryen in the Mother Mole / Hardhome role since that was Mother Mole's prophecy of finding "salvation across the sea" ...Â

Yes, she was the wildling Karl shoved over and then got her revenge by stabbing him during the fight with Jon Snow. She's absolutely gorgeous of course - they dirtied her up and did a good job of making her look pretty terrible (bruises, scrapes, nappy hair) in the show.

2895	binga	2014-05-10	It was a nonsensical attempt at a girl power moment. I am sure they must hate the Night's Watch but it is better than just going off to die.
2896	Hippocras	2014-05-11	It was a nonsensical attempt at a girl power moment. I am sure they must hate the Night's Watch but it is better than just going off to die.I very much doubt it.
The show used the opportunity to feature a new character, one we already saw helping Gilly escape, and chances are we will see her again. Since the Mother Mole thread is rather important in the books, I think it is quite likely we will see these women head to Hardhome, either die there or be captured there by slavers, end up in Braavos, and the rest of those events we don't know yet in the books.

Â 
We also saw in Season 1, Bowen Marsh, a character who we know for a fact has been far more important in the books, than Mother Mole and he got cut in season 1. Why do you think they are going to keep an even more minior character around? Why can't this just be the end of Craster's Wives story?

2898	Ghost's Shadow	2014-05-11	Jon would imo not risk a Hardhome mission, one that took all his ships away in the book that is, to re-rescue a few women who were offered to be let to the other side of the Wall in the first place.
Â 
In the books it was a lot of people he tried to save, but in the show the NW's numbers are already so down it's truly impossible to send out more, just like Bowen Marsh might not lose a hundred himself, now. If CB is the biggest castle and there's barely 100 there, the other two won't even have that.
2899	Hippocras	2014-05-11	We also saw in Season 1, Bowen Marsh, a character who we know for a fact has been far more important in the books, than Mother Mole and he got cut in season 1. Why do you think they are going to keep an even more minior character around? Why can't this just be the end of Craster's Wives story?
First of all, Bowen Marsh has not been cut. His role comes later, even in the books. In the books he only becomes Jon's antagonist after he becomes Lord Commander. So there is no basis for the claim he has been cut. In fact he is up there at the high table with maester Aemon, Thorne and Slynt in the NW scenes.
Second, WoW is not out yet, but I disagree that the Hardhome events are some kind of irrelevant tangent. I suspect they are quite important in the future story. In the books, Mother Mole is never seen directly so far, but there is no reason the show could not do it differently. The show could actually show her leading hundreds of wildlings there, then them being attacked by white walkers, then picked up by slavers etc. 
It of course depends what happens at Hardhome and with the wildling from there who end up in Braavos or shipwrecked on Skagos in the next book. Some people think the ones who were captured by slavers then freed in Braavos will connect with Daenerys, breaker of chains. At the very least they might tie in to Arya's story.
We just don't know where that storyline is going yet. But I, personally am of the opinion GRRM did not put it in the books for no reason. I think it will turn out to be important. And if so, the show has started to set it up by giving us a character who might become mother mole.

Jon was determined to lead a ranging there. He may go now as Ghost. Or Bran may show his new powers there. With a character like Bran, physical presence is not actually required. There are other possibilities I will describe below.
I have the sense that Hardhome has some secrets that will help those fighting the Others (Jon, Bran, Stannis, friends) understand who and what the Others are and where they come from, what they are fighting for etc. Hardhome is therefore a major clue to the war for the Dawn. In other words, more important than you are giving credit for. It is a common tendency for fans to not acknowledge the importance of events that have not yet been developed in the books, and because the importance of Hardhome will only become clearer in books that have not been published yet it is hard to say exactly where that thread is going. That should not be confused with irrelevance.
What we do know about Hardhome is that it will be the source of a major wight army. That, on its own, would make for a very cool TV image sequence. 
Some of the wildlings ended up in Braavos, we already know. Some also ended up shipwrecked on Skagos. There is therefore the possibility some of them will cross paths with Davos, Rickon and Osha, while others cross paths with Arya. These wildlings now in Essos could very well become a thread helping with the task of reconnecting the Essos and Westeros storylines. The ones in Skagos could become a force influencing Rickon's fate.
Another possibility of course is that ships full of wildlings became ships full of wights en-route to Essos, bringing the zombie plague across the narrow sea. 
In short I see a number of potential directions that Hardhome might take the story, and all of them are interesting and relevant. But only GRRM has the final answer. If these events are important, the show has started to set them up, I believe, via Craster's head wife.
2904	Envie	2014-05-11	I was really enjoying your various theories as to the importance of the Hardhome / Other / Braavos in the future of the story until I got to this line:
Â

Â 


Â 
Wait, what?Â 
Â 
I think you are mixing up your shows / zombie tales here just a tad.  The 'wights' are not caused by a "zombie plague" of any sort. They are dead risen by the Others themselves and whatever magic they use. Men who die south of the wall, or anywhere else, do not come back as zombies / wights (unless you count Beric or LSH and that's a different sort of "resurrection" magic at play). It's only when in the presence of the magic accompanying the White Walkers north of the wall that dead corpses rise. A ship full of wights would kill anything living but once they got to Essos the chain is broken - there are no White Walkers there.
Â 
But back to your original point - I think there's validity in keeping the Hardhome story arc in the back of our mind and not dismissing it. Whether or not it becomes important to the show is another matter entirely. Both are dependent on whether or not GRRM has the Hardhome story become part of the end-game story or it's just another one of those side stories to throw readers off that doesn't go anywhere. We have no way of knowing.

Â 
First of all he has been cut, the actor who played Bowen Marsh is now playing Othell Yarwyck. Source . Second, if you don't remember, it was Bowen Marsh who was the acting Lord Commander in the books, in the show it is Alliser Thorne. It was Bowen Marsh in the books who sends most of the remaining Brothers at Castle Black to East Watch because Mance tricked him into thinking they are going to attack there, not Castle Black. Leaving the Castle mostly defenseless so the 200 strong raiding party in the books could take the gate unopposed. But Jon manages to defeat the raiding party forcing Mance to use his main force to attack. The events leading up to the Battle of Black Water are very different from the show to the books. Now tell me again please, why you think the show won't change/get rid of a minior character?
Â 
Second, WoW is not out yet, but I disagree that the Hardhome events are some kind of irrelevant tangent. I suspect they are quite important in the future story. In the books, Mother Mole is never seen directly so far, but there is no reason the show could not do it differently. The show could actually show her leading hundreds of wildlings there, then them being attacked by white walkers, then picked up by slavers etc.
Â 
Well I still think Coldhands has his part to play in the books, but we have seen no sight or sound of him yet. But from the looks of it he has been cut, other wise I don't get why he was not introduced last season.
Â 
It of course depends what happens at Hardhome and with the wildling from there who end up in Braavos or shipwrecked on Skagos in the next book. Some people think the ones who were captured by slavers then freed in Braavos will connect with Daenerys, breaker of chains. At the very least they might tie in to Arya's story.

Â 

Â 
I agree with that we don't know where the story in the books is going yet, and may be the events in Hardhome still has a role to play. But I don't see why the show would care if does or not. It been made pretty clear to me the show is going it own way about events. They wouldn't be the first studio ever in the history of film, to break away from source material, they won't be the last.

No, don't watch any zombie shows. 
You must admit wights are pretty much zombies with a different name though. They kill people. The people they kill start walking around doing their own killing....pretty much same thing as a zombie plague.
2907	Stone Cold Bastard	2014-05-05	While I really appreciated it and had been looking forward to it for a long time, did anyone else find it underwhelming? For instance, when they're reunited in ASOS, just north of the wall after the battle, Ghost leaps at Jon and they roll around and cuddle on the ground, like anyone would do after being seperated or away from their pet for a long time.
Â 
Perhaps it's just nitpicking, but does anyone else feel the same way?
2908	ipsuel	2014-05-05	It was literally the first thing I said. I was thrilled they're back together -- but I wanted that puppy/human moment... I always liked that scene in the books -- Jon with a freaking direwolf rolling around like a puppy who found his way home :-)Â 
Â 
That being said, my son immediately looked at me and said, "Give it up Mom, it's too difficult with CGI."
Â 
Lol. He's right of course, but still -- Brat.Â
2909	WTFSalami	2014-05-05	Pretty impossible to do that with a superimposed direwolf.
2910	Mark Antony	2014-05-05	Definitely underwhelmed but not surprised. Ghost has been butchered on the show

I know and this kills me... I absolutely love the idea of him. I'm fine with the other direwolves, too -- but let's face it, Ghost is just... better ;-) Â
2912	sati	2014-05-05	I actually loved it. Cried like a little bitch when it happened
2913	Chilli	2014-05-05	Maybe it would have been better if they used dogs who look like wolves instead of cgi-direwolves. I know the cgi-direwolves look great but they are too much off screen. Or they could use wolf-dog hybrids like the saarloos wolfdog. They are not dangerous, I've seen one kept as pet, and I think you can train them.

2915	Stone Cold Bastard	2014-05-05	Kit's acting has been fine and think he has really stepped it up this season with much more beefier material - thought he hit a grand slam out of the park with his speech in episode four.
Â 
Regardless, I thought they actually used real wolves (I seem to remember seeing the wolf they use for Summer in front of a green screen) and then utilized CGI to make them huge.
Â 
I can understand if it was too difficult/impossible to have Ghost cuddle with Jon (leap on him and roll around in the snow), but at least Jon could have pet him more and hugged him, with Ghost licking his face a couple times.

I think Kit has been phenomenal, comparing to his acting in previous seasons, this year. He actually has some charisma now. The speech scene was fantastic and he was really good in this ep as well.
2917	Chilli	2014-05-05	Yes the use real wolves but the actors don't see them because they are filmed seperatly, that's why it's difficult to cuddle these wolves. In the first episode they used real dogs, they should have continued that.
2918	Reinzer	2014-05-05	All the CGI budget went into that tree vision. No budget for much direwolf action

2922	acosta	2014-05-05	Kit was fine, but the scene overall definitely underwhelmed me. I've pretty much resigned myself to the reality that the CGI wolves are never going to be as good as the wolves in my imagination. I fully understand why they aren't using real dogs, though. There is no breed large enough. These animals are significantly larger even than real dire wolves were.Â
2923	acosta	2014-05-05	Note when they were using the Northern Inuits in the first three episodes, they were only meant to be a few weeks to a few months old, and they were already the size of an adult large breed. Summer went from puppy to full-size Northern Inuit in the span between Bran falling and the assassin coming for him. Grey Wind is bigger than Robb in the first episode of season two.Â
2924	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-05	It was pretty adorable when Jon said "I missed you boy"Â thenÂ GhostÂ leans forward and makes whimperingÂ noises.
Â 
Yeah, I hate how all the CGI goes to the dragons.
Â 
Ghost has been amazing in the past two episodes, especiallyÂ with things beingÂ personal between him and Rast (reflecting back to season 1). At least the show have given him a sassy personality. I hope they keep this up.

Wolves are too small.

2931	lostinwesteros	2014-05-05	Yes, I thought it underwhelming, too, horribly so.  I understand the limitations of working out how to superimpose what where, but, really, they could have given it some energy.  And it continues to be a thorn in my side that they don't show the dire wolves nearly enough.
2932	roxWolfox	2014-05-05	Yep.Â  If Jon had mentioned how much he missed Ghost in previous episodes, it would have made the reunion all that much more profound.Â  But he didn't.Â  And the reunion wasn't.
Sad, because the direwolves are the reason the Starks are my faves.
Anyways, Ghost and Jon are re-united.Â  And Jon was happy, at least.Â  Ghost didn't appear too ecstatic at the meeting.Â  What do we infer from that?Â  Hmmm.

2934	Seneti	2014-05-06	Are you kidding me? IMO the reunion of those two was great. It certainly brought tears to my eyes and it did match Jon's character (whereas cuddling a direwolf and rolling around in the snowÂ with it does not, at least IMO).

Seriously guys, here the producers throw you a bone (no pun intended) and you trample it like an unwanted, flee-ridden rug.

Good observation. You're totally right.
2935	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-05-06	Why didn't they use Andy Serkis as Ghost and make it precious?
2936	Black Wolf Smith	2014-05-06	I also think it was a bit underwhelming. It was like anybody else finding their dog. I think that has more to do withÂ the fact, they don't have the bond that Book Jon/Ghost have, and the setting is vastly different. In the books Jon hadn't felt Ghost in a long while, and when the reunite it is if his other half is back. Â
2937	Mini Ghost	2014-05-06	Jon should've felt Ghost first before Grenn saw him. It'd show us that there still the bond between them after long separation. IMOÂ
2938	voodooqueen126	2014-05-06	In an interview/behind the scenes thing I saw on Youtube, Kit Harrington actually discusses the difficulty of acting like a green sausage CGI thing is your long lost pet.
2939	bayjew	2014-05-06	Felt like it was a bit underwhelming yes, but felt his appearance was great if you perceive how the direwolf acts like Jon. Slow and silent, careful etc. I liked how it was slow and not overdone.

I think that is just a common curse like non-Christians will say "Jesus Christ!" and "Oh my god!" despite not believing in the religion.
Â 
Arya also said it in Season 1 when Sansa was going on a rant about how she loved Joffrey and wanted to have his babies. It was a pretty adorable scene, she sniggers saying 'seven hells' and Ned gives her a small 'try not to laugh' smile in return, clearly agreeing with Arya ... Â ..

But it's a giant direwolf. Cuddling with a giant direwolf, after killing a bunch of scumbags, would still be pretty badass.
2949	Ingelheim	2014-05-06	I loved it.
2950	The Lizard King	2014-05-06	He's said it before when Ygritte escaped from him. It seems to just be a common curse, having nothing to do with one's religion.

2952	Asshai by the Shadow	2014-05-06	For me the Jon/Ghost relationship overall is so meaningful and it's one of my favorite things about his character in the books especially. This moment in the show when they reunite is completely underwhelming. Kit's acting is good but the CGI direwolf is not even looking at him he has a blank stare it's easily noticeable, and i wish he would have licked him or something. That was disappointing..
2953	DaveyJoe	2014-05-06	Ghost has seen some shit:Â http://dorkshelf.com...6-11e3-b567.jpg
2954	MoA«t	2014-05-07	Pretty sure they actually use real wolves in front of a green screen and then add CGI to make them larger:http://cdn.screenran...es-Season-3.jpg
Wouldn't be that hard to do: film Jon and Ghost cuddling, then add CGI.

Yes. They use real wolves, which are, like I said, too small. Which is why they then use CGI to make them bigger. 
So, you shoot Kit and a wolf doing their reunion wrestling/cuddling/rolling in the snow thing. Now, explain how you separate Kit from the wolf, just enlarge the wolf, and merge them back, frame by frame. Then explain how much you charge for that. Because if you can, they should hire you so we can all have more direwolf action.
2955	Mithras	2014-05-07	It sucked and destroyed the real dynamic in the books. Jon was about to accept the offer of Stannis and the return of Ghost persuaded him to refuse him. This was the second time Ghost prevented Jon from leaving the NW. At the first time, Ghost betrayed Jon's position by scaring his horse and his brothers found him and dragged back in AGoT.

Since this is a book spoilers thread, I assumed that most of the people read the books.


Â 
But it still hasn't happened in the show yet, so how can it destroy the dynamic?
Â 
Arya didn't get stabby on The Tickler, but she still got stabby on a guy. That "dynamic" still happened, and there was nothing lost because she got stabby on a different dude.
Â 
If you expect the show to follow the books verbatim, you need to stop watching, because it won't happen.

The scene you're talking about hasn't taken place in the show yet, and Ghost had nothing to do with Jon being found by the Nights Watch in the show.Â 
Â 
None of this has destroyed "the real dynamic" of the books, because the books still exist and you can go back and read them.Â
2960	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-07	It's a CGI problem, not an acting problem. I liked it. Show Jon is not a 15 year old boy, he's a grown man.
2961	Mark Antony	2014-05-07	Please, Kit is JUST managing with the speeches and badass moments... we should be patient for when he manages to show strong emotions.. he's not there yet. =(
I agree He's improved a lot but he struggles with the emotional scenes imo like in season 3 (I have to go home now) cringe . Kit wasn't terrible in this scene but idk it just felt flat to me. It would help if they had an actual relationship on the show lol

2963	greywindsrage	2014-05-07	Liked it. Wished it would have been more hugs and licking but CGI problems.
2964	Aerys Blackfyre	2014-05-08	I totally agree with the OP
2965	clawson24	2014-05-08	I too was underwhelmed by the scene. Any chance we get to see the direwolves on screen I'm always incredibly excited about, though it's obvious the practical/budgetary limitations that exist will never allow them to be as prominent as they are in the books.
Â 
I personally just didn't love Jon's response to seeing Ghost. It was far too casual. A lot of the people in the thread that are commenting that Jon's too "old" and "manly" to react any differently must not be dog owners. He didn't need to skip up to Ghost, giggle, and roll with him for 30 minutes for the scene to be more affecting. If my dog had just turned up after being completely MIA for months, I'd be shocked, overwhelmed and ecstatic -- and that's a dog, not a rare creature that I'm spiritually/mentally linked to.
Â 
The scene just required a bit more emotion in my opinion, but I understand that the realities of filming the scene opposite of a green meat-sack probably weren't the easiest for Kit. He's been solid the rest of the season for sure.
Â 
Ghost looked absolutely bad-ass when locked up and snarling at Rast, though. If only the capabilities existed to put that on screen more often.

OMG. That made me cry. And I'm at work....

They're supposed to be intelligent, not always in a cage or falling in a hole.The show focuses very much on the dragons but hardly EVER on the direwolves. This will never fail to make me sad.
2971	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-08	They have to play up the dragons otherwise no one would give a shit about the Essos storyline.
Â 
I agree with the treatment of the wolves. With the exception of Summer they've all been swept to the side. Hopefully Ghost will have more of a presence this season considering how much important stuff goes down at the Wall.

In all fairness, they brought Ghost back earlier than the did in the books.  So there's that, at least.
2973	Talking Hodor	2014-05-08	Kit's acting has been fine and think he has really stepped it up this season with much more beefier material - thought he hit a grand slam out of the park with his speech in episode four.
Â 
Regardless, I thought they actually used real wolves (I seem to remember seeing the wolf they use for Summer in front of a green screen) and then utilized CGI to make them huge.
Â 
I can understand if it was too difficult/impossible to have Ghost cuddle with Jon (leap on him and roll around in the snow), but at least Jon could have pet him more and hugged him, with Ghost licking his face a couple times.


Wolves are notoriously hard to tame and train.Â  I wouldn't want to roll around with a wolf, no matter how tame they are.Â  Even if I were Jon, I'd have developed a health respect for a beast that could tear a man's head off in two seconds.Â  Not sure the books showing them rolling around in each other's arms is that realistic.
2974	The Sword of the Night	2014-05-08	I agree but it might've been too expensive to show Jon and the cgi wolf having much contact. Especially rolling around. 
I hate the fact that the show had the wolves get captured. Especially by the halfwit mutineers.
2975	The_Lone_Direwolf	2014-05-08	To those upset about Summer being caught... to be fair to Summer, Bran was controlling him at the time.
2976	XSarellaX	2014-05-08	Well, I liked the reunion in the show, but I like the one in the book waaaay better. Not necessarily because of the cuddling and rolling in the snow, but because of the moment. You can really feel like Jon is being reunited Â with a part of himself, something that gives him confidence about his identity, his purpose, his morals. He's a Snow, and it's okay, the world has a place for him too.
Â 
Besides, we won't have Jon saying "I thought you had died on me too. Like Ygritte, Robb, and all the others" (paraphrased)
2977	Le Cygne	2014-05-08	I wanted him to say "Ghost, to me" - in a different way than usual. Stress the me, the emotion is in the way he says the words. That would have been cool.
2978	acosta	2014-05-08	Well, I just cried for like six minutes thanks to that Christian the Lion reunion.
2979	acosta	2014-05-08	I mean, for pity's sake, if there's ever an Arya/Nymeria reunion, let it be that corny. Give us one moment! Everything else can be nasty, brutish, and short; just give us that one moment.

2983	ToTheWolves	2014-05-11	Just thinking...you know how they teased us with the whole jon and bran reunion(even though we knew it wouldn't happen) how sweet would it have been if ghost seen bran or ghost seen summer or something of that sort.
2984	Kaspiro	2014-05-05	The preview for the next episode makes it pretty evident that Asha (Yara) finally reaches the Dreadfort to free Theon, and she and Ramsay confront one another. Since the entire 'Asha attempts to free Theon' plot is a show-only storyline, the ending to this plot is still somewhat open to speculation. How exactly is that going to work itself out? If I were to guess I'd think that since Asha, Theon and Ramsay are still all alive in the books, they will likely all leave the encounter relatively unscathed. The real question is whether or not Asha will succeed in freeing Theon. Will she overcome Ramsay long enough to free him, only to be captured herself and brought to the Wall in order to re-merge her storyline with her book counterpart's? Or will Theon remain a captive, and be freed later on?Â 

					
					
							Edited by Kaspiro, 05 May 2014 - 07:51 PM.
2985	Martin Lasarte	2014-05-05	I'm quite sure she'll end up getting caught by Ramsay and replacing Jeyne Poole in the whole fArya subplot. Ramsay will marry her to claim the Iron Islands after Balon's death. That will mean no Kingsmoot, probably, but fuck it, the Ironborn were boring anyways.
2986	lostinwesteros	2014-05-05	Hmmmm.  You're so right. They will have to do an awfully lot of condensing pretty quickly. We're already 1/2 way through Season 4, but, like you, I'd be happy to eliminate the whole Ironborn plot.  Think it'll be abbreviated, though, and not eliminated, 'cause we need all those ships converging on Meereen, methinks.
2987	Cas Stark	2014-05-05	My guess is it will be a 'whole lotta nothing' like the Craster's Keep storyline.
Â 
She can't save Theon because Theon needs to stay with the Boltons for all the Winterfell stuff. Â So she will fail. Â She can't get captured by Ramsay...because then how will Stannis get her? Â So, it will be a confrontation that results in nothing.
Â 
They have to have to Kingsmoot to introduce the Greyjoy brothers, I don't think they can cut Vic, not sure about Euron, he so far hasn't done anything that can't be cut, but not sure about the future.

Stannis can take Asha/Yara prisoner when Theon and her scape Winterfell and run into his army. The only reason he had to capture her before in the books is so that we could have a POV in Stannis' army, IMO.

Â 
She will never serve as fake Arya. Â Jeyne Poole was a meek girl already beaten down by abuse. Â Asha Greyjoy is a badass. Â If they do that I might honestly stop watching it would be so absurd.
2990	acosta	2014-05-05	There are a few ways they could go to get to basically the same place. Abandon the Jeyne Poole subplot and just have the Boltons claim Winterfell, in which case Theon doesn't need to be there to help her escape, so Asha frees him only for both of them to get captured by Stannis before they're able to get out of the north. Have her fail and get captured herself, and then both of them escape when the Boltons go to Winterfell, only to get captured by Stannis. Have her fail but get away somehow.Â 
Â 
It seems almost certain she'll fail, since I'm pretty sure they've kept Theon's role in subduing Moat Cailin, which obviously requires he still be a Bolton captive.Â 
Â 
They can pretty easily do away with the Kingsmoot and just have the crown pass to Euron, without the need for an election, in the absence of any evidence Theon is still alive or capable of ruling, since Euron is next in succession anyway. They still need to introduce the dragonbinder somehow and get the fleet to Mereen, but they don't need to spend a season making everyone think Asha is going to be elected Queen and explain all the lore and history of the Iron Islands first.Â

The problem is I can't see Yara trying to free her brother, failing and then just saying "Tough luck, bitch" and running back to the Iron Islands for her Queensmoot. And I can't see the Boltons taking her prisoner and not trying to take advantage of the fact she's the heir to the Islands.

Should make for some great action and fight scenes though - these changes (ie more action) are definitely welcome.

Looking forward to seeing Yara kicking some ass. Sounds really weird, but I find her strangely attractive.

That actually does seem to really limit the outcomes for Theon. Still kind of unsure where Asha can go after this. I'm hoping the event does actually have some lasting impact somehow, and doesn't end up being purely filler while the ironborn plot is or is not being waited on.

Â 
She'll have to though. Â We know if the Boltons capture her, Ramsay will rape and torture her...I can't see that happening, it would totally change her story. Â So, the Boltons can't get her.
Â 
She can't get Theon because he has to go to Winterfell.
Â 
So, she will have to fail to save him and barely get away with her life....I could be wrong, but I can't see Asha being turned into Jeyne Poole...for the same reason, it turns her into a victim and that's not her story.

I guess they could cut the kingsmoot, but then how will the TV audience remember who the Greyjoys are?

The actress portraying Yara is quite attractive (just look at her in this video). I don't understand why they made her so ugly in the show.

2997	The Dragon has three heads	2014-05-05	No one has been cast for any of the iron island rolls but all three brothers are mentioned on the GOT wiki, which may mean after this seasons...cull, we'll see some iron islands plot after all.

Â 
It makes sense as in the end they will both end up with Stannis anyways... but they will have to change Jon's motivation for marching to Winterfell. I was actually hoping Locke would be caught by Jon and spill who sent him there and spark that Ramsay/Jon rivalry.Â

The Pink Letter itself is quite a good motivation, even without that whole Arya bussiness. Ramsay did threaten to attack Castle Black.

3002	Wagshell	2014-05-06	I was actually wondering if the trailer was set up to give a false impression actually. It showed Asha doing something, then showed Ramsey enthusiastically attacking somebody, but there's a chance they are actually unconnected scenes. We never saw them together. I wonder if they actually meet at all in this episode.
Â 
Maybe I saw it wrongly though.
3003	LROSyke	2014-05-06	I'd give it all to see Asha split open Ramsay's fucking skull. 
Too bad that won't happen.

Â 
I was thinking exactly the same thing. Maybe Asha is somewhere around Dreadfort and then she finds out Theon went to Moat Cailin. Next shot we see Ramsay fighting someone else somewhere around Moat Cailin. Locke managed to get to the wall since last time they showed Boltons, so it would seem rather silly if Ramsay and Theon were still at the Dreadfort. Also if Asha just shows up at some random non Dreadfort place also looks kind of silly, maybe if she has a line of saying how she got the info somewhere maybe.Â
3005	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-06	They CANT cut the ironborn - I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SEXY PIRATE EURON,no but in all seriousness I doubt they will do that im pretty sure this will be another big filler chapter of the show like crasters - pretty excited about it though its about time we see some BAD ASS ASHA
3006	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-05-06	How's this for a weird twist to the farya plot. What if Ramsay breaks asha just like he broke theon? Since they won't get to WF till next season, it does give some time for that to happen, with the addition of theon riding to MC with Ramsays instructions that unless the IB leave Asha is going to be flayed where they can all see?
3007	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-06	No.
3008	Cas Stark	2014-05-06	It also could be that the trailer gives a false impression...but if not at the Dreadfort, then Asha would be at Moat Calin, so she will still lose whatever battle shes' engaged in...
Â 
Another questionable choice on the part of the show.
Â 
It might turn out to have been better to keep her on Pyke and show a few scenes with her and her father to prep the audience for the incoming Greyjoys..
3009	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-06	I have to admit her rescue speech scene last season was one of my favourite parts of the whole season, great television.

It was a great speech. Â 
Â 
But, now they're stuck with her on a rescue mission that is doomed to fail, which I guess in and of itself isn't necessarily bad but it will be more "filler" than the craster's keep stuff because it can only turn out one way...she loses, Ramsey keeps Theon and then she does??Â

If they are going to have both Vic and Euron in the show and not combine them into one guy...which i assume depends on what they both do in the end game....then it seems like they have to have the Kingsmoot to situate them in the audience's mind. Â 
Â 
Otherwise, Vic will Â just be another brown haired guy with a random british accent whose on a boat...no one will get it.
3013	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-05-06	No.
Yea that's such a solid response. Then either one of two things will happen 1) she's dead, she never meant shit in the entire story and neither does the IB 2) complete filler where she gets away and just wasted everyone's time. 
Sorry but both make no sense tv wise or story plot wise and does nothing to advance the plot. Either she's captured and used to rouse the IB from MC or just kill her off and let everyone know she wasn't going to be of any significance.

Get ready for complete filler, because I can guarantee you that she is not going to be captured by the Bolton's and anyone trying to pass her off as Arya Stark, Ramsay's bride.

I agree she can't be FAyra. I mean, there's kind of a huge age difference there.
Â 
I'm assuming she'll take on Vic's role, and we'll only get Euron. I doubt we're getting the Kingsmoot. Of course this is all complete speculation until we know casting for S5.

If they cast Vic and Euron, that would make the show crazy Greyjoy heavy...I wasn't a huge fan of having two brothers in the books either and the Damphair, it always felt like too much time spent on people who were unlikely to figure into the main resolution.

Actually that passing off of Arya is my fault, I should've explained better but kids were screaming. I believe asha will be captured for story wise, and used as a bargaining chip. As of now, she's precious to a Live Balon, he's obviously not dead yet. After getting the IB to leave MC, Ramsay will be made lord of WF and legitimized as Bolton. Roose says we own the north, still have asha, theon is broken, we can bind the IB to us by marrying their heir to you so when old man Balon dies we control the north and the isles. Don't need a farya since Boltons believe with the north decimated by war, Freys and Boltons still having tons of man power (show only with the naAvetA© of it all so don't pounce) no need to appease the other lords since we killed all their men. At this point, the show has diverged so much from the books that something's aren't that big anymore. Also when Balon dies, having Vicuron(combo character) emerge and seize the IB under the Bolton nose adds more intrigue.
3018	Phonzadellika	2014-05-06	I think Theon is going to betray Yara and the other Ironborn but Yara will find a way to escape. Ramsey may trot out Theon to do something dastardly like lock some of the Ironborn in a prison cell or something to get flayed later. They are going to make Theon's betrayal of the Ironborn way more complete than it was in the books and Yara will be there to witness it first-hand. I think that there's a slim possibility of Theon actually killing Yara at Ramsey's command. Moat Cailin will be nothing after that. It'll show Theon all weepy afterwards.
Â 
If Yara lives IÂ could maybe see Yara taking the place of Victarian in the books and being sent to Slaver's bay if they wanted to consolidate characters. That would really disappoint me though because Victarian is one of my favorite characters in the books.

Â 
Absolutely. I'm just guessing based on what we know of the IB plot now.
Â 
We do know that the show-runners like to be parsimonious with new characters (look at Loras becoming an agglomeration of all the Tyrell boys), so I thought Yara absorbing Vic's arc might work. You're right that it feels very IB heavy in the books, and I'm not sure the show would necessarily want to pivot to that. And given the number of new characters we could potentially get in S5, I think IB is one of the best storylines where the fat could be trimmed.
Â 
However, until we know the end-game, this is all complete guess work.

Why would Jon send anyone to save Asha? Â Why would the Boltons go to Winterfell in the first place if there is no wedding? Â And then you'd have Theon saving his own sister and they both get caught at the same time...
Â 
And it still would put a seriously independent badass female character under the thumb of the Boltons, which would totally change who she is.

Ugh. Â Why did you have to remind me about Loras the only heir to Highgarden? Â I still am not sure how they're going to work that....is Loras really going to become a member of the KG...and leave Highgarden without any future Tyrells? Â And does that mean in the books both brothers are going to get killed....and effectively end House Tyrell's future or was this one of those random, poorly thought out changes the show made....
Â 
I would think Asha would be better to take over Euron though...she stays in Westeros and reeves around, LOL. Â But they could cut Vic's navy altogether also...and just have Dany pick up a navy in Essos. Â So, yeah, what the show does is really dependent on what Â happens in the books that have Â not been written yet. Â

I don't see Loras joining the KG. Tywin will die in time for Cersei to call off the wedding. I don't know what that will mean for Marg's trial (some have hypothesized her Trial of the Faith will go poorly and she'll call on the not-really-injured Loras) or for the Dragonstone plot, but they may be able to pull it off. Their handling of the KG in general has been weird, and a bit inconsistent.Â 
Â 
Back to IB stuff, Daario did jut get Dany some ships this past episode...the need for Vic's fleet is kind of diminishing. But who knows. Maybe we'll get all three brothers and I'll eat my words.

Not in any order
1) Ramsay marries Asha at WF to take his seat there, dad and other lords attend per dads command and as a way to show fealty to the Boltons. 
2) Asha has an affinity towards Theon, so maybe he's used against her to coerce her to the marriage (hopefully no flaying and such for her, that's just too dramatic)
3) Jon is already on Rooses radar so the PL cleverly rewritten as a straight threat to NW to get rid of Snow still antagonizes Jon to march there, still have the ides of marsh scenario, but instead of oathbreaking marsh and co. See it as the only way to ensure the rest of the watch isn't decimated. 
4) Jon sending Mance/Abel doesn't have to happen or could be a clever way since they probably after MC know that Theon is alive, and Jon knows unfortunately that atleast Brans alive, using it as a way for Mel/Stan/Jon to find out about Rickon. Which may eliminate Manderly plot but its the show and budget constraints but still have Davos with something to do after finding out he's alive.

You can never tell with D&D.

Â But, then, I'm still waiting for "the wolves will come again, I dreamed it"..so who knows.
Â 
But, I don't think they'll do it this way. Â The Fake Arya plot is important on a lot of levels and the show is barely able to contain the plot holes they create with minor changes, I can't imagine the plot and logic carnage if they tried to pull of a scenario like you describe.

I tend to agree. IMO Frey Pies will probably be left in as RW "revenge" that the show-watchers will probably appreciate. And FAyra does seem pretty central to where the North storyline is going, so I doubt it will be changed too fundamentally.

3028	-Ghost-	2014-05-06	Maybe the preview is messing with us and those scenes don't mean anything. Like someone else said, Locke made it all the way to the Wall already, so Ramsay and Theon have to have made it to MC. Maybe that's where Ramsay is fighting and Asha gets to the Dreadfort and Theon isn't there. She battles with some of Roose's guys and loses and hears that Balon is dead and Euron has returned, so she heads home for the KM.

Â Here's a great reason why I hated the change, westerlings come from a poor house with little troop support inside westeros, Talisa came from an old noble house from Volantis (a rich city) why didn't she and Robb reach out to her family to help him win his war? At the very least they would've sent sellswords you think to ensure that their daughter didn't get slaughtered or become a queen. Just saying, if you lived in the westerlands not rising against Tywin if you're his neighbors makes sense, the guy will obliterate your house, even if it'll benefit you more if you join robb and he wins, but if you're in Volantis you'd be like who is this Tywin douche trying to kill my daughter and son in law, lets kick his ass.
Eta: this just came to me, being she was from an old house in what's left of the freehold, did you catch why she had to die at the rw? Bc old in Volantis probably means dragon blood of some kind, her and Robb's kid would be a child of ice and fire, sorry kid you're dead, there's only one of those and his name is Jon Snow lol

That's exactly why they made Talisa. They didn't want to depict Robb as the bumbling honor-ful idiot in the books. The tv audience would have reacted overwhelmingly negative to Robb if they found out he married a girl just because he bedded her out of wedlock even though he didn't love her.

Â 
You're right, and it's a shame, because that's why it's tragic in the books: like father, like son, both died due to their sense of honor (though they did have shades of that in the TV show with Karstark). However, you're right that it wouldn't have played out well on the TV medium.

3047	DaveyJoe	2014-05-06	I don't think marriage is in the cards, but Roose seemed quite vexed by the Greyjoys holding parts of the North.Â  He said he had to sneak himself into his own land because of the Greyjoys, so Roose considers them to be enemies and capturing Yara would be very useful as a bargaining chip.
3048	Roxane De	2014-05-09	No way Asha will take Jane Poole's place. The attack is just a filler so that they can have the Kingsmoot in the beginning of season 5. I bet Balon will die around the last episodes of this season and then we will have a scene where Stannis says to Davos that the burnt leeches worked. Maybe they will make Asha miss the Kingsmoot instead of getting there and loosing it so that gives her a reason to claim the Iron Islands afterwards? But she definitely wont be captured, or if she gets captured maybe she'll escape or she'll be sent back through a hostage bargain.
3049	RedShirt47	2014-05-09	I assume that Yara will head to Moat Cailin to pick up troops to head for the Dreadfort and this is when Ramsey and Reek show up.
There is some sort of confrontation and Yara will escape with some men and will wander til eventually running into Stannis.
if there is a Kingsmoot then Yara isn't needed there. It would be simpler to have it beÂ  between the brothers only.
3050	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-10	If HBO wish to cut the Kingsmoot for budget reasons then all they need do is combine Euron/vic into one character (not sure if that can be done depending on what GRRM has planned in the future storyline for the Greyjoy brothers) and have Arya away from Pyke
Â 
I'm soooooo looking forward to seeing this pan out but hope it isnt a let down like the Mutineers battle last week at Crasters
3051	Martin Lasarte	2014-05-11	Why would the Boltons marry their only son to get the Iron Islands? Â The Iron Islands which have no resources to speak of....when their actual problem is replacing the Starks as the ruling House of the North?
Â 
And any way you look at it, Asha will not submit to such a thing, so, it's not going to happen. Â Even for D&D it's a step to far down the road of makes no sense. Â 


Â 
If she ends up becoming fArya, I can see her wedding night with Ramsay playing out just like in the books
3052	Unthinkable	2014-05-11	So Arya's TV list of names is quite different than the book list:
Â 
TV list: Joffrey, Cersei, Lord Walder, Meryn, Tywin, Melisandre ("the red woman"), Berric, Thoros, Illyn, Gregor, Hound
Â 
Bold being names not in the book list, crossed out being known to have "died" at some point by ADWD. There are some names from the books not in the TV list, but they are all minor characters or not in the show.Â 
Â 
Does this mean Walder, Melisandre and Thoros should be expected to die in future books? Thoros is minor enough that the show and books could diverge, but naming both Walder and Mel speaks ill to me of their book futures. Particularly Mel, this is the first indication I know of that she would die.

3054	Frey Pies	2014-05-05	Everyone I was with loved this episode. Surprisingly, while I found it to be great (in the better half of GoT episodes), they all thought that it was one of the best episodes of the series. There was a huge uproar when they found out that Littlefinger was behind Jon Arryn's death, and the Jon and Bran scene at the end left everyone immensely satisfied. One of them said that he's beginning to like Jon, Bran and Sansa a lot more this season than he ever did before. Also, the Hound and Pod were referred to as "beasts", in a good way.
3055	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-05-05	My hubby is really impressed with Hodor and wants to know what in the world he is. Â We talked about Osha saying he was part giant.Â 
Â 
I had to pause/rewind the Lysa/Littlefinger conversation and explain it a bit. I don't think he's fully grasped it but he's getting there. My Dad was like "What happened to Jon Snow?" He almost got killed. I guess he thought Jon was supposed to be un-killable. heh
3056	Uldra I	2014-05-05	When my unsullied brother, who is a hunter btw, saw Pod pull the burning rabbit out of the fire & said, "First you singe the hair off."   Then when Pod started stomping out the fire, he said "Then you tenderize it."   I cracked up.  :-D
I love Pod scenes!
3057	RavenKing23	2014-05-05	My brother saw LF and joked about how he fought Jackie Chan once
3058	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-05-05	yeah, i had to explain how lf was literally behind everything
3059	King Zee	2014-05-05	my mom got really confused when Sweet Robin called LF "uncle". She wanted to know if Lysa and LF were brother and sister ............  .
Â 
Though good Â that she remembered Lysa and Robin immediately.
Â 
Â 
Mom also keeps forgetting who Jojen is. Though she remembered Meera. Which is funny cause last season she remembered Jojen but kept forgetting who Meera was.
Â 
She finally had enough of Bran and wants to know just what the hell they're looking for up north.
Â 
Â 
She love'd all of Jon Snows scenes though.

3060	Gail	2014-05-05	Because I kinda spoiled them and told that Jon Snow is presumably dead in the books, they're always at the edge of their seats whenever Jon is fighting. It was fun watching them scream and cheer for Jon 
And for obvious reasons, they're kinda disappointed that Bran and Jon didn't even meet.
Â 
Big WTF for the Jon Arryn revelation, and I kinda have to explain to them that Lysa is just fucking crazy for LF to do that to her own husband.Â 
Â 
They're kinda disappointed how weak Arya is. (Though really, that sword is not really for armored people)

3061	hollowcrown	2014-05-05	I watched with my girlfriend - she didn't get the Jon Arryn revelation, had to explain that to her, but she's got it into her head that Dany has good intentions but is a terrible leader, which makes me proud.
3062	ohpooratlas	2014-05-05	My unsullied boyfriend remembered who Lysa Arryn was, which surprised me ... because he can hardly remember half the main character's names. He was mostly like "Oh fantastic. That crazy bird's back now?"
Â 
I feel like the show revealed Lysa and Petyr's role in Jon Arryn's death far too casually, because my boyfriend completely missed the relevance, and I had to pause the episode and explain it to him. Don't know if this was intentional on the show's part so it could be brought up again in front of Sansa later during the Only Cat scene, or if it was just poor execution.
Â 
He also caught the significance of the Hound being the last name on Arya's list.
3063	Mannisman	2014-05-05	I watch GoT with one of my unsullied friends. He obsesses over the show, rewatches every episode the next day, and recently read the first book. He was amazed by the Jon Arryn revelation, especially considering we were just recently rewatching some episodes from season 1. His favorite scene was Arya and the Hound; I know he'll be so damn disappointed when they separate (although he is convinced that Arya will never get to the Vale). He is actually really great with predictions. He figured out Olenna and Dontos as culprits in Joffrey's murder (although not LF) and can't wait for Oberyn to face the Mountain in "some sort of duel". Last night, upon seeing the preview of the trial, he said that the trial will go south for Tyrion before Jaime frees him. He is also convinced that Bran will meet the children of the forest at the end of the season.Â
3064	lyanna_maria	2014-05-05	My flatmate didn't remember the Jon Arryn bussiness and I had to pause the episode and explain it to her, as with most of your Unsullied. He thinks Tommen is cute and feels for Podrick Payne: she wishes Brienne was nicer to him. For some reason, he dislikes Pycelle very much, and says so every time he's on screen.Â
3065	greywindsrage	2014-05-05	One of my friends believe that Cersei and Prince Oberyn are going to team up.
3066	gotgrrrl	2014-05-05	Husband didn't understand why Myrcella was sent to Dorne -- I had to reminder him it was to protect her during Stannis' attack on Kings Landing and to solidify alliances with Dorne.Â  Earlier in the season, he had completely forgot that Joff had siblings.Â 
Â 
He also couldn't figure out what was up with Cersei, especially her being so nice Oberyn ("that Spanish guy") until he realized that he would be deciding Tyrion's fate.
Â 
He was also confused by Jojen's vision.Â  "Why was his hand on fire?"
Â 
Wants to see more of Dany (she's easy on the eyes) and the Hound (because he is also Scottish)

3067	Gendrys Forge	2014-05-05	I don't know.Â  I stopped watching with my friend after the episode where dany launches the barrels of chains into mereen.
Â 
"Man I bet those guys are shitting their pants, dragon lady is going to enslave them all, look at those collars.".....
It takes too much time to explain things to him.
3068	zombree	2014-05-05	My friend was saying how he doesn't like how Jorah is always so puppy dog-ish around Dany...
3069	Natalie Underfoot	2014-05-05	My husband caught the Jon Arryn scene right away. Â Said that he feels like this episode was really "about the Game" which he liked. Â The littlefinger reveal combined with Cersei's attempted manipulation plus the fleshing out of all the ulterior motives is entertaining for him to watch. Â 
Â 
Remembered Lysa right away, it's amazing what inappropriately breastfeeding a 9 year old will do to make a character memorable. Â
3070	Seneti	2014-05-05	When my unsullied brother, who is a hunter btw, saw Pod pull the burning rabbit out of the fire & said, "First you singe the hair off." Then when Pod started stomping out the fire, he said "Then you tenderize it." I cracked up. :-D

Â 
Maybe next season she'll finally remember both of them. You know... just in time for that one possible scene.
Â 
Â 
Â 
BTW: What were all the Unsullied's reactions to Dany deciding to stay in Essos? I can't imagine that that went over well with show watchers...
3071	hollowcrown	2014-05-05	It appears loads of people love Daario as a character seriously wtf
3072	Haymaker	2014-05-05	My unsullied wife was shocked at the Jon Arryn reveal and did not need any explanation, which gave me great pleasure.Â  Think the show did a good job bringing his name up once in awhile in conversations over the past 3 seasons, where I made it a point to subtlety reminded her who he was to ensure this moment wasn't lost in confusion.Â  She also was on the edge of her seat hoping Bran would get Jon's attention and was disappointed they didn't meet up.

Those same reviewers didn't seem to be too upset that Dany is staying in Slaver's Bay either. "Slaver's Bay ... that's a thing the show made up, right?" And one of the reviewers has read the books and tried not to laugh and told them that was the name of the region.
Â 
One of the guys also made the comment of "I wonder who is going to go out that moon door?" And again ... book reader tried to keep a straight face and deflect the conversation. 
Â 
From what I can gather, the unsullied generally really liked the episode. It's only us book readers who are nitpicking.
3076	StrollofShame	2014-05-05	Hi, all! 
.BF just loves the show but has no patience for thousand-page novels. He couldn't for the life of him recall why the Hound was on Arya's kill list---yet he said he figured Bran was gonna meet up with a religious figure represented by the 3-eyed crow, learn some mystical tricks, & save the whole world while Dany & Jon were still trying to decide what the hell they were even doing. I thought that was rather astute of him. Altho of course we don't really know what impact Bloodraven & the Children will actually have, quite yet.

Â 
I also watch those reviews.Â  I like it because it let's me see what the Unsullied who really enjoy the show think about it, and their insights are pretty good.Â  One of them recently came up with the theory that Jon Snow is the son of Elia and Ned.Â  Like, two steps away from R+L=J.Â 
Â 
The Unsullied I watch with are not as interested in the series as I am, and they tend to forget people and miss a lot.
3082	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-05-06	After talking to my unsullied mom "That crazy Lysa was faking with all that screaming wasn't she? He didn't really have sex with her?" Â I told her they did. "Well, then why'd she get mad at Sansa?" Because Lysa be crazy, Mom! Â
3083	MrsManderly	2014-05-06	AnÂ unsullied colleague was shocked and bummed out that Daenarys wasn't getting on those 96 ships, like immediately, heading straight to Westeros
Â 
Aaah those Unsullied and their naive ways....
3084	ovis alba	2014-05-06	One of my friends (actually usually not to bad informed) found it very cool, Bran can warg people now. He apparently completly forgot about the first time.
3085	Littlefinger of the Hand	2014-05-06	My unsullied wife loved this episode. Shocked of LF revelation but she was annoyed from jon snow not being able to finish a single combat in his own.
3086	PatrickStormborn	2014-05-06	AnÂ unsullied colleague was shocked and bummed out that Daenarys wasn't getting on those 96 ships, like immediately, heading straight to Westeros
Â 
Aaah those Unsullied and their naive ways.... 


Â 
It was a very strange deviation for the show to make... In the books, Dany has no ships at this point, which is one of the main reasons she kind of has to stay in Meereen; if she marches, she risks losing a large number of her people, which just isn't feasible when she only has 10,000 soldiers (particularly as the 2,000 sellswords she has would deteriorate rapidly on an unpaid march down the Demon Road).
Â 
Maybe the showrunners thought people would be more interested in Dany's reign of Meereen if she has the power to leave whenever she wants... Her powerlessness is frustrating in the books, but it's mostly to set up the arrival of the Ironborn and Tyrion, and Dany's eventual taming of Drogon and reunion with the Dothraki. Having 93 ships seriously undermines those plot developments, and completely rejects the possibility of a siege of Meereen (which was already in danger after her season 2 storyline saw the deaths of all the members of the Qartheen government).
3087	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-06	friend of mine is now wondering if Bran will end up warging in to Tywin and use him as puppet...true story
Â
3088	Indigocell	2014-05-06	I wonder how long it will take Unsullied to recognize the difficulty in controlling dragons, and the possibility of "warging" them.
Â 
I still feel like that is going to become key to controlling the dragons in one way or the other.

Â

Â 
I think the 'difficulty in controlling dragons' thing will be coming up during this the rest of the season. I have long suspected that one of the meanings for the title 'Children' would be referring to Dany's struggles with her children.
3090	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-06	just got 2 new ones...
Â 
- Bran will warg the Nights King and use him to destroy the WW
Â 
- Sansa will very soon kill herself
Â 
i suppose second one isnt too far out there...if Lysa had made it, she might have made Sansa's life even more miserable
Â 
you know what bugs me though...none of the unsullied are thinking about why Bran is the only Stark to have warging abilities. When i tried to bring it up randomly to ask a friend if he's ever wondered how come Bran has these abilities, like where could he have gotten them from...he paused for a moment...then
Â 
"well the Targs must have some magic, it would make sense that they needed some warging ability to control dragons, so Bran could be a Targ!! OMG!!"
Â 
 Â  my last attempt at trying to get an Unsullied to think beyond what they have showed so far
3091	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-06	My mother, who has never read the books and has only minor interest the show, saw the Purple Wedding episode, and knew knew on her first guess who was involved for carrying out Joffrey's poisoning.Â

Â 
you know what bugs me though...none of the unsullied are thinking about why Bran is the only Stark to have warging abilities.Â 


Â 
Have seen a discussion by an Unsullied who noted "Sansa is the only one of the Starks who has lost her 'spirit animal'."
Â 
I am hoping for Arya to have a wold-dream at the end of this season so the penny may drop. The show might suppress it though - and make it a bigger reveal for another certain incident that happens later.

Â 
How about the obvious answer: "He just happens to have a very special gift?" I mean, there are people in real life who can do stuff that no other person can do so...
3096	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-05-07	One of my friends thinks it was very smart of Dany to stay in Meereen. After all, she has an army, a city of her own. Why go to Westeros when she can have her own desert kingdom?
3097	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-05-07	Unfortunately, after that fit of jealousy on Lysa's behalf, a lot of friends/family think its a guarantee that she'll die soon (which makes me wonder if they would have even thought that if her jealous outburst had been reserved for Snow Castle/Only Cat). They also think that Sansa will either marry Robin or LF will kill Lysa and take Sansa for his wife right after.
Â 
Also, a lot of my friends think Robin is LF's son. Was surprised by how many people think this.
Â 
One of my friends also predicts that the White Walkers will ultimately sit on the throne and rule all.
3098	Neumond	2014-05-07	One of the Unsullied was bugged by the Margery/Cersei-Talk and that Cersei went to her father to help Margery marry Tommen. I was rather pleased that he, even as a show-only-watcher, thought it was totally out of character. Perhaps the characterization of Cersei wasnÂ´t as bad as I thought.
He asked right after the episode of my opinion and how this was explained in the books.
Â 
They reacted pretty surprised that Sansa was told to marry Sweet-Robin.
Â 
It seemed they were a bit confused over Jojens Greensight-thing, but rather pleased Meera didnÂ´t get the treatment of Crasters wife-daughters... (As was I)
Â 
I was a bit disappointed, no one reacted to the Jon-Arryn-reveal... perhaps they donÂ´t even know anymore who he was.
Should I remind them of the letter Lysa send in season 1?

Â 
I think you should. That isn't a spoiler and is the key event that lead to the war. Its important they realise Baelish is playing such a long game.
3100	Inv1ctus	2014-05-07	I definetly agree, I think you should tell them about it. Haha I imagine your disappointment when they didn't connect the dots.Â
3101	Night'sQueen	2014-05-07	Unsullied husband is out of town and we didn't get to talk until Monday.  He was very anxious to discuss. His comments:
Him: So is that the real deal with Jon Arryn? Is that how it went down in the books??
Me: Yes.
Him: Wow, so Littlefinger was behind everything from the beginning! (I think he has a whole new level of respect for LF's game.)
He also was pleased with himself for predicting that Bran would warg Hodor. But, he was disappointed that Bran/Hodor killed Locke because he was hoping Jaime would eventually get revenge.
3102	Devlonir	2014-05-07	My girlfriend was really happy to see Lysa again. She really enjoyed the crazy, over-attached mother and was happy to see her back. And she loved all scenes in that part of the episode. She did not need to be explained the Jon Arryn thing like some others.
Â 
She got sold on the reasons for Dany to stay in Meereen, so no problem there.
Â 
And she really liked the whole Craster's Keep scene. "Hodor gonna Hodor" she said with a smile the moment Bran warged him and Hodor's emotional reaction afterwards really touched her. Really well done considering he cannot give that emotion in words, only actions.
Â 
What she also really appreciated was that Bran made a conscious choice to avoid Jon, not was powerless in this aspect. She felt it was really great storytelling that the cripple chose to walk away in this situation, and added that it made her feel it showed he has started to take control of his own fate, instead of being controlled by it, which he has been so far. When she said it like that, I totally agreed with it and now love the addition of this storyline a lot more.
Â 
Finally, she has become a huge fan of the Brienne/Pod pair and really loved that scene and odd couple as they go out into the world.
Â 
In general, it was a good episode with a lot happening which keeps watchers involved.

You are right. They need to know, he had his hands (fingers) in everything since the beginning... I was just pretty confused, no one showed any reaction to that scene.

I will tell them. First I was completely confused and then I felt disappointed... One of them even told me he rewatched all previous episodes before this season started.
The others are somewhat excused since it has been three years since the first episodes.

What she also really appreciated was that Bran made a conscious choice to avoid Jon, not was powerless in this aspect. She felt it was really great storytelling that the cripple chose to walk away in this situation, and added that it made her feel it showed he has started to take control of his own fate, instead of being controlled by it, which he has been so far. When she said it like that, I totally agreed with it and now love the addition of this storyline a lot more.


Â 
Wow. I hadn't thought about it like that yet, but, yeah it makes a lot of sense.
3107	lostinwesteros	2014-05-08	I love reading this thread. I no longer work with TV viewers who haven't read the books and I really miss their comments.I have, though, FINALLY, after years of pleading, gotten my daughter to at least watch the TV series, but she's halfwaythrough Season 2 and still doesn't know which one is Jon Snow or what Arya's name is. Sigh... I just to tell her to keep watching, but I fear she may be hopeless.

Also, a lot of my friends think Robin is LF's son. Was surprised by how many people think this.

I thought a lot of book readers suspect this to be the case as well? I haven't read up on it so I don't know whether it has been debunked but I think it is a possibility especially considering how obsessively attached Lysa is to Robin which mirrors her unhealthy obsession with Petyr.Â

Haha, that would be awesome! I don't think Petyr would be too pleased considering how weak, sickly and annoying Robin is .... another one for the moon door!
3111	ohpooratlas	2014-05-09	I have yet to talk to an unsullied who is disappointed by Dany's decision to stay back in Meereen. They all think it's a smart move on her part, given her inexperience with ruling.
Â 
One of them definitely expects her to ride a dragon soon though. I think they all care more about that than Westeros at the moment.

3113	Indigocell	2014-05-09	He also was pleased with himself for predicting that Bran would warg Hodor. But, he was disappointed that Bran/Hodor killed Locke because he was hoping Jaime would eventually get revenge.


Â 
You should point out the fact that he was killed by Hodor, warged by Bran, who likely never would have discovered the ability if not for Jaime's actions in the beginning.Â  That's a neat little connection pointed out earlier that I thought was cool.Â  His revenge was already set in motion.Â

He doesn't have to wait long! Funny how everyone was hating on the scenes last season, but now that they've not appeared for some time, people are actually craving for more Theon & Ramsay.Â
3117	Bastard of the Dreadfort	2014-05-10	My non reader friends think Ramsay is a cowardly fool. Despite what he's done so far on the show... I try to explain to them that in the books he's a worse monster than Joffrey, but they don't believe it (rather, they haven't quite seen it yet).
I try to explain to them, that he flayed Theon, broke his spirit, let his dogs kill people in playful hunts... But they just don't think he's on the same level as Joffrey. They also think that he might be mentally stunted like Robin, that's why he enjoyed the dogs scene, the same way Robin enjoys throwing people out the moon door.
Â 
How can I explain to them, without spoiling the books, that Ramsay is infinitely more evil than Joffrey???
3118	Inv1ctus	2014-05-10	Well explain to them that Joffrey is the one who's a coward actually. He always had others do his dirty work, except in the case of Rose. Ramsay flayed Theon with his own hands, among many other things. Now I remembered how much I enjoyed Ramsay completely owning Theon at Winterfell, that was great.

3126	Chebyshov	2014-05-06	We're not getting him...John Bradley said this last season. BR's been cast, so we know Bran's getting to the tree this season (they wouldn't have cast him just so he could say "North" in Bran's visions). There just isn't time to introduce CH without it feeling really off. It's a shame; he would have been cool to see on screen, but obviously his existence doesn't affect the end game too much.

Â 
That is a shame, was looking forward to his introduction. Wonder if we'll ever find out who he really is then?Â
3128	Fylimar	2014-05-06	I would have loved to see him, too. Coldhands might not play a big role besides bringing Bran to BR, but he brought a lot of mystery to the books. ANd I was hoping, that he has a bigger part to play, but if he is cut from the show, I guess, this isn't the case
3129	Monk Meth-	2014-05-06	i think in the books coldhands dies fighting the wights around the great tree. it's not said but he was alone vs a lot of them.Â 
Â 
Sucks hes not on the show.. i really wanted to see him on screen.. prob my fav non character, character
3130	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-06	WHAT THE FUCK?? are you 100% sure hes being cut completely??

Â 
I'd put it at 95%. It's possible Bradley was talking only about CH not being in Sam's arc, but given where we are in the season, I'd be floored if CH popped up. Looks like we'll have to wait for the books to clarify who he is/was (if that's ever explicated).
3132	BoxCarRacer1478	2014-05-06	The only thing that has me clinging to hope is how long the show took to intro Sir Dantos' role...I just want to see Coldhands on screen. I guess GRRM told the show runners he doesn't have a further role in the books...

Â 
Ser Dontos was in S2
3134	BoxCarRacer1478	2014-05-06	He didn't really approach Sansa about leaving until this season, I believe.
3135	salmonsnake	2014-05-06	Better not to even anticipate CH's appearance. (Then if he does show up it'll be all the more exciting)
Â 
They've eliminated, for better or worse, all the reasons for his existence. And I imagine the wights outside the cave will be handled by Hodor and Meera, as well as the CotF. But since Bran won't have a lot of material left for next season, and I expect J, M & H to head back to the Wall at some point, maybe they'll have him show up at that point, just for the hitherto-elusive fuck of it. But I doubt it.
3136	Chebyshov	2014-05-06	He didn't really approach Sansa about leaving until this season, I believe.


Â 
I see what you're saying...they cut the florian/jonquil stuff so Dontos didn't take on his role as Sansa's friend/helper until this season.
Â 
I think it's difficult to extrapolate that to CH, because he would literally come out of no where and be around for 2 episodes before Bran gets to the tree. I just don't see his purpose at this point in the story.

					
					
							Edited by Chebyshov, 06 May 2014 - 09:56 AM.
3137	Envie	2014-05-06	Yeah for whatever reason, they decided cutting Coldhands out of the story and adding Locke / Karl and the additional Craster's scenes would be better television material than a mysterious dead guy with black hands who leads everyone to Bloodraven riding on an elk.
Â 
I had always hoped we would find out who Coldhands really was from the books as well. I'm doing a re-read of ADWD now and it's occurred to me in this second read of the chapters with him in it that one of the theories I've read here on the forums might have merit. It's entirely possible he was just some dead corpse / wight that Bloodraven was warged into as a way to contact and help Bran get to him is really possible. If that's true though, wouldn't it still have been important enough character development for the powers of Bloodraven to have him appear on the show?
Â 
My best guess is they decided it would be too tricky to show onscreen well and if the character has no future use in the books (because it's just a wight controlled by BR) then there was no need to film him at all.
3138	boojam	2014-05-06	On an island somewhere, smoking cigars with Strong Belwas and laughing at Patchface.Har!Well never say never.Remember when many around here were convinced the Reeds were cut?
3139	BoxCarRacer1478	2014-05-06	I hope they do a documentary/behind the scenes of why they changes some stuff for the show.
3140	Chebyshov	2014-05-06	I hope they do a documentary/behind the scenes of why they changes some stuff for the show.


Â 
They may, but this one is easy to sum up: 10 hrs of screen time vs. 1,040 page novels. Anything that may be viewed as extraneous is on the chopping block.
3141	sj4iy	2014-05-06	He is on the island of misfit characters.....him, Belwas, patchface, gatehouse Ami, Benjen......oh wait, he disappeared in the damn books too!


Â 
Quoted for emphasis.
3142	salmonsnake	2014-05-06	Did he disappear so much as not being able to enter the warded cave which the POV character has not left yet.
3143	Hodor's Dragon	2014-05-06	The only thing that has me clinging to hope is how long the show took to intro Sir Dantos' role...I just want to see Coldhands on screen. I guess GRRM told the show runners he doesn't have a further role in the books...


Â 
I wouldn't be surprised if the show becomes increasingly unhinged from the books. Â Not only are the show's departures from the books increasingly major, but the producers don't seem to be concerned about the virtually 100% certainty that the show will hit its allotted 7 seasons before the 7th book is finished.
Â 
Remember GRRM is a TV guy - he knows all about the way you change written material to fit it into a TV show. Â I'll bet he has in mind an alternate ending that would work for TV and that won't spoil the book ending at all. Â That's my prediction, anyway.
Â 
Even if I'm wrong about that, though, just because X happens in the show doesn't mean Y won't happen in the books. Â I definitely wouldn't rule out Coldhands playing a major role in the books just because he doesn't appear in the show (assuming he doesn't). Â (Personally, I always saw him as a bit part guy, but I could be wrong about that.)
3144	ToTheWolves	2014-05-06	I could've swore coldhands was cut...not sure if it's just for this season or all the way through. Maybe they are just holding back and will bring him in later...this is a huge cast so I can see them holding off until they absolutely introduce him.
3145	Arkash	2014-05-06	Long shot here but I dont know if Rast was among the body burned at CK. Wonder if he'll come back as a wight.
3146	lostinwesteros	2014-05-06	No Coldhands for us, alas.
3147	lostinwesteros	2014-05-06	Long shot here but I dont know if Rast was among the body burned at CK. Wonder if he'll come back as a wight.
Actually I wondered the same thing. My sense was that he had not.  When someone counted dead bodies at CK and figured out it was Rast who was missing, they must have thought he'd gotten away, not knowing Ghost was even there, much less that he'd killed Rast.  I always worry about dead unburned bodies.  Weren't there 4 dead bodies at the end of ADWD that were stored down in the ice lockers under the Wall?

3148	Khal Porno	2014-05-06	Coldhands isn't missing, he's in the books where you can always go back and find him whenever you want.
Â 
Also it seems to me that there is still plenty of time for him to show up in the show if they want/need to include him.
3149	roxWolfox	2014-05-07	The one I miss from the show the most is Mormont's Raven, but I'm an animal lover first and foremost, so the missing Coldhands doesn't seem to bother me as much as some.Â  What I wondered is, if he does show up, what'll the reaction be?Â  The non-readers won't have had the years to delve into the mystery of CH the way the readers did, so I'd be more interested on 'reader reaction', myself.Â 
For that reason alone, I can only hope he's going to make an appearance soon.Â
3150	The Fenris Wolf	2014-05-07	I got suddenly VERY excited at the end of the episode when Rast was running away through the forest and we hear ravens, I was convinced we were going to see Coldhands then, and it would have been a cool introduction. But no :-(


I thought this exact thing! Â In fact while watching it with my non-reading wife, I said something like "I know who he's about to meet!" before Ghost showed up. Â Not that I minded seeing him die by direwolf bite of course.
3151	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-07	Coldhands isn't missing, he's in the books where you can always go back and find him whenever you want.

3154	darksellsword	2014-05-07	They aren't showing coldhands Because its Benjen Stark,on screen it would be so damn obviousÂ 
its him they are delaying it, before anyone says oh but the actor who plays Benjen Stark is not listed. They kept Kevin spacey's name
off the opening credits on the movie se7en to keep his characters Identity secret.It might just be a personal preference but it would be
such a crappy change to cut him from the story.
3155	Carcetti	2014-05-08	The one I miss from the show the most is Mormont's Raven [...]


Â 
This. I've always thought the raven said very relevant things.
Â 
Btw for those of you who believe in the CH=NK theory, we have effectively seen him, if HBO is to be believed.Â
3156	petertel123	2014-05-08	coldhands is not going to happen, unless he has a major part to play in the coming novels, but I doubt that
3157	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-08	I do miss the Raven as well
3158	acosta	2014-05-08	I loved the raven in the books, but a talking bird would not have fit the tenor of the show any more than a cartwheeling circus freak who only speaks in rhyme always being in the same room with Stannis.
3159	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-08	Nah, I still think they should have included patchface.
3160	Carcetti	2014-05-08	Yeah I mean i understand why they cut charachters like Patchface, Coldhands, strong Belwas, Mormont's raven and Daario's Beard, but I stil believe the show would have benefitted from these comical individuals.Â 
Â 
Also, it makes me more and more afraid that they're not gonna include Stoneheart, which would be a miss if there ever was one.
3161	Yojimbo	2014-05-08	I had a feeling they where going to axe Coldhands, when the show underplayed the whole subplot behind the red comet. The Other's mythos is going to get scraped in the show, they're simply going to be the "omg kill them all with fire!" badguys, hence why Dany and Tyrion are being white-washed because they're going to be the "saviors of westeros". Because at this point, the book's are not going to be finished before the show and the vast majority of the show audience wouldn't get or care for the idea that maybe the whitewalkers aren't the biggest threat to westeros. This is why am not in the camp of "OMG THE SHOW IS SPOILING THE BOOKS", the show and the books in my opinian are going two seperate ways.
3162	StrollofShame	2014-05-08	^^Not sure how the Others Mythos has been scrapped..the show has now officially shown us more about the Others than the books have so far.
My predictions are NO Coldhands, NO fArya, & NO Penny...definitely LS, definitely Aegon & definitely Manderly.

Â 
Because that was the moment for me at least in the books when Coldhand was introduced I thought, "WOW maybe the Others are not what they seem, in fact what could the Others be for then? Maybe to defend the realm from something even more destructive? Like fire breathing flying lizards? All the show has shown as is, undead ice zombies turn babies into undead ice zombies. Better hope Dany gets her arse out of Mereen soon to save Westeros's babies.............

That's just your read, though, not part of the actual Others mythos. We have no idea whether or not Coldhands is in any way associated with them. He expands the mythos of the universe in general, showing it's possible for an undead human to be something other than a mindless zombie under the thrall of an ice demon, which I figured was important at the time, but who knows? It's entirely possible the books never explain who or what he is. It's also possible that does matter but the show will just introduce the idea in another way. It's hard to believe they'll cut it completely if it's actually important.Â

I really hope you are right. Because I hate the show.
3166	StrollofShame	2014-05-08	I could be wrong, but I was certainly under the impression that Coldhands is a Wight, & not an Other. In which case, I'm not sure I understand how his nature might make anyone assume much of anything about the Others, except that he probably became a Wight due to them. My feeling was that he was "recreated" as an intelligent Wight by Bloodraven, in some manner we know nothing about...yet. If anything, maybe the question should be, what is the direction/motivation of Bloodraven & the Children, when you consider Coldhands? 
If you think that all we learned from the show about the Others is that they make OTHER Others from babies, & that we weren't shown the possibility of them being much, much more (such as having organization & hierarchy, & performing complicated ritual/magic), then I guess I saw that scene entirely differently.

Â 
And your completely right, it is after all just my interpretation. One am not even sure myself if I think is 100% correct but I just can't shake the feeling Coldhands still has a part to play in the story. I can also see your point that you have a hard time believeing they would cut something out of the story if it was actually important. But I myself have even a harder time believeing George would allow the show to give spoilers/hint to which direction the remaining books are going, because the show is going to be finished by a good few years before the remaining books are. After all what book to film transalation has ever been 100% faithful?

Â 

Â 
From what been described he has the simularties of a Wight, but he has black eyes not the pale blue like other Wights. And I agree with your questions about Bloodraven & the Children. But this is where I have a hard time buying into that the show is giving us infomation about the Others before the books, I honestly can't see any author allowing some one else to divulge into infomation that he or she has not brought up him/herself. Do you really think the show is going to tell us the end of the story of a song and ice fire before george does? Or do you think it more likely the show and the books are going to seperate more and more as the series goes on? Because after all it going to be only 7 seasons, and am not in the camp who believes the books are going to be finished before the show.

3168	StrollofShame	2014-05-08	^^Are you thinking then that GRRM will tell the showrunners NOTHING about future storylines, or tell them to "wing it" on their own after ADWD? Because he doesn't want his proprietary storylines used, as they are for his purposes in finishing the books only? 
Or do you think he might mislead them, & make the last books completely original or different to the show? 
Lots of bookreaders believe the show is "winging it" enough already. I would think GRRM has enough love & respect for how his work is being portrayed to be straight up with the showrunners. The show will continue to deviate from the books as they feel necessary, & I am certain to be disappointed in SOME directions the show takes, but I would lose all interest in GRRM as an author if the books turn out to have a decidedly different outcome compared to the show. 
I'm just one person whose likes or dislikes are of relatively little importance, but I'd sure hate to discover GRRM misled the showrunners regarding his epic story--especially in light of the fact that he COULD have had the books done by now!

One am not even sure myself if I think is 100% correct but I just can't shake the feeling Coldhands still has a part to play in the story. I can also see your point that you have a hard time believeing they would cut something out of the story if it was actually important. But I myself have even a harder time believeing George would allow the show to give spoilers/hint to which direction the remaining books are going, because the show is going to be finished by a good few years before the remaining books are. After all what book to film transalation has ever been 100% faithful?


Normally, I'd agree with that, but I was under the impression he has explicitly said he gave them the ending with the intention they use it. I mean, if he dies and we never find out what was supposed to happen, I'll resurrect him and kill him again. He'll be 75 if it takes as long to write 6 and 7 as he took to write 4 and 5. There aren't very many 350 pound 75 year-olds walking the earth.Â

3170	acosta	2014-05-08	If you think that all we learned from the show about the Others is that they make OTHER Others from babies, & that we weren't shown the possibility of them being much, much more (such as having organization & hierarchy, & performing complicated ritual/magic), then I guess I saw that scene entirely differently.


Yeah, I thought this was an important reveal, too. These aren't just some mindless force of nature ice demons in thrall to the devil. They have a social hierarchy and rituals of their own and exist for reasons other than just to kill humans.
3171	Yojimbo	2014-05-08	^^Are you thinking then that GRRM will tell the showrunners NOTHING about future storylines, or tell them to "wing it" on their own after ADWD? Because he doesn't want his proprietary storylines used, as they are for his purposes in finishing the books only?
Or do you think he might mislead them, & make the last books completely original or different to the show?
Lots of bookreaders believe the show is "winging it" enough already. I would think GRRM has enough love & respect for how his work is being portrayed to be straight up with the showrunners. The show will continue to deviate from the books as they feel necessary, & I am certain to be disappointed in SOME directions the show takes, but I would lose all interest in GRRM as an author if the books turn out to have a decidedly different outcome compared to the show.
I'm just one person whose likes or dislikes are of relatively little importance, but I'd sure hate to discover GRRM misled the showrunners regarding his epic story--especially in light of the fact that he COULD have had the books done by now!
Â 

Â 
Ok, say (god forbid) George lose's his mind and jump off the deep end, and in his next two(?) books reveals Drogon has killed ever character in the story so far who are alive, puts on a top hat and sits on the Iron Throne and proclaim's himself First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm. Do you think HBO are going to show us that? Of course not.
But if George has given the show all the major plot points of the story, why the hell is it taking him so long to write it? Because writing is organic, what George may have thought was a great idea at the time, he may change his mind when it been written down, he also may have other ideas while writting and think "wow I've just got to add this to the story now." I don't think (thankfully) George has some rare disease which only allows him to write so many words per day before he shuts down and can only type again when his battery has recharged.
Â 
But then again the show could finish, the books have not, and George can say "Well the show pretty much covered what I was going to write, so thanks for all the fish kids am out of here" Making him the greatest troll the world has or will ever see again...............
Â

Â 

This is the only risk as book readers we are taking (I hope), George could possible die before he is done. I hope of course this is not how it will turn out, but look at Steven King, he almost never finished the Dark Castle saga (among other future works) because he got knock over by a car, which in turn lit a fire under his arse to get cracking on with his books. But then again look at Robert Jordan and Frank Herbert, sadly we will never get to see how their versions would ever be.

3172	StrollofShame	2014-05-08	Writers do often say the characters tell their own stories after a while, no matter what you as a writer may have intended at the start. I am sure GRRM will flesh out action & dialog (and characterization) in his remaining books in ways the showrunners couldn't begin to detail...as a bookreader, I know this will be true & I look forward to it. But the bones of the story will be the same. The resolutions will be the same. It would be a huge disservice to his own story to do otherwise. 
Not saying the utterly bizarre is impossible. But I believe he has enough self-respect to avoid this type of sensation.

Of course and at the same time not have one ounce of respect for the fans of the books (not the show) who have been waiting years for the books to be finished, to have a show tell us how the books are going to be finished? If that was the case I wouldn't mind George being up front about it, because imo that the hallmarks of a man who doesn't give two shits about his work if he would let another person finish his work before he does.

3174	SynthFG	2014-05-09	Truth is we haven't needed Coldhands this series, and in truth he would have complicated the revised Bran Arc,
Plenty of time to introduce him either at the end of this season, or next if he's going to be important in the future,Â
3175	Carcetti	2014-05-09	Even if George has told D&D the broad strokes, and the faiths of the major characters, he couldn't possibly have told them all the context it happens in, simply because he probably doesn't know it that precisely himself. I think the endings for the major characters will be the same in the show as in the books, but the way how for example Jon learns about his mother and defeats the others (or whatever his end is), is most likely unknown to the showrunners. This is also the reason I don't care as much about the show spoiling the books because there will be so much more left to tell in the books which the show hasn't touched on.Â
3176	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-09	Because that was the moment for me at least in the books when Coldhand was introduced I thought, "WOW maybe the Others are not what they seem, in fact what could the Others be for then? Maybe to defend the realm from something even more destructive? Like fire breathing flying lizards? All the show has shown as is, undead ice zombies turn babies into undead ice zombies. Better hope Dany gets her arse out of Mereen soon to save Westeros's babies.............what about that very nice subtle detail in earlier season of others artfully arranging corpses into a symbol, that doesnt scream mindless zombies to me...
3177	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-09	I did love CH though and am majorly pissed off that hes apparantly been cut, I just dont agree that theyre portraying the others as mindless ice zombies who are obviously evil, they dont come across that way to me, theyre much more interesting.

I think that's a bit harsh. From what the impression I get, GRRM really doesn't want the show to overtake the books.
Â 

	Spoiler  I think that is reflected in the release of the Mercy TWoW chapter which coincided with the Season 4 dA©but. Even though only a small portion of the chapter was incorporated into the show I think he wanted the fans to see it his way before they saw it in the show. 

Â 
I honestly think that he really intends to have the books out before the show overtakes them and the threat of this may just be the catalyst he needs to get a move on. I'm not saying it will all work out in the end only that I think that's what he is working towards.Â

Â 
I use to have that impression aswell, but it now 2014. The show is running for 7 seasons, so it will be finished in 2017. We have yet to even have confirmation that tWoW is coming out in 2015, this is pure spectulation from fans and wishful thinking. (which I hope they are right) but even if it does come out next year, George will not be writing aDoS till at least 2016, because he will be going around the world promoting his book, as he did with aDwD, which will also be expected of him by his publisher. So if he startsÂ  aDoS in 2016, he going to compelte his final book in one whole year? I really think that ship has long ago sailed away.
Â 
And yes I made a very harsh comment, but that only if it goes that way (which I really can't see happening and really do have more faith in George than that) then imo, it would rightly be deserved
.
Take this for example;
Â 
The Red Wedding, imagine now the show, showed us that before the books. Exactly the same way it was done in the show, then a year or two later George gives it to us in the books, exactly the same way he written it in aSoS. Are people really saying you wouldn't feel cheated by that? Even though imo the events leading up to the Red Wedding and the Red Wedding itself are better in the books than the show, I would still feel massively disappointed. Because the show has already left the cat out bag, the fact that we already knew that Robb and Cat are going to die would massivly diminish that whole plot point from the books. Whats more if the show finish's before the books it would not just be the "Red Wedding" ruined, it would be ever major running plot in aSoIaF diminished..........................it would be the biggest slap in the face to book readers ever! Hense am finding it more likley the show and the books are going in two different directions.

Â 
I get the feeling that a lot of the final book has already been written so he will be, as it were, filling in the gaps which will take far less time than writing a book from scratch (optimism born of desperation?). The reason I believe AFFC & ADwD took so long is because he had to completely restructure everything to make up for the lack of the 5 year gap. With that being said, if he doesn't begin ADoS until 2016, I do agree with you that it is extremely difficult to believe that he will be able to finish and publish it within a year. I guess it all depends on when TWoW is published but it doesn't seem as though it is going to be this year and the longer it takes the more likely it is that the show is going to overtake the books.Â

Yeah, I would definitely feel cheated if I were spoilered by the TV show but I don't know whether I would want the show to diverge from the books completely because then it wouldn't even be the same story, just some weird breed of author sanctioned fanfiction. I think that would ruin the TV series for me. The reason I like it is because it is based on the books I love. It's a tough call. I guess we will see how it plays out.

3182	Colonel Green	2014-05-09	I thought the show was going to be 8 seasons


They've been saying 7 or maybe 8 now.
3183	DaughterOfThe9Moons	2014-05-09	I think it's going to be 7. D&D have been saying it is going to be 7 for a while now and I think it has been speculated that there may be 8 but the majority of people seem to have settled on 7. They're more than half way through the TV series by now so if they haven't yet figured out how many seasons they need before the end of the books then they're going to be facing some serious pacing problems. I am sure they have decided and have the story mapped out. They are running out of published material fast especially for certain characters and I am certain they will have to incorporate AFFC and ADwD material into the story this season. Realistically they have 3 seasons left (if they stick with 7) and material from 4 books to include.
3184	Eberc	2014-05-09	All of this talk of the show overtaking the series is well founded, I honestly believe it will happen. What I don't like is that book readers feel that they are special and that GRRM owes it to them to not let that happen.
If you don't want to be spoiled, don't watch the show. Viewers who were completely captivated by the show and wanted to explore the books were given the same choice.

My thoughts exactly. I also think the number of folks here who give up on the show to wait for the books, or conversely, insist they won't read the last book(s) because the ending was ruined by the show, is trending toward a pretty small number overall.  I find both show & story irresistible (& not always in a good way...compelling might be a better word.), & suspect many will not want to give either up whilst we wait for the other. It's human nature to satisfy our curiosity.

Â 
Thing is, I don't believe the show runners owe the book readers anything as far as not overtaking them in the story.Â  Turn about is fair play since now book readers run the risk of being spoiled in the same way that show-only viewers have been thus far.Â  Actually, one could argue that the type of spoilers us book readers face are miniscule in comparison to things like my friends being spoiled on the Red Wedding for example.
Â 
It is unreasonable to assume that the show should wait until you have had a chance to finish the books.Â  That is something that could end up costing them a great deal of money.

3190	Envie	2014-05-09	I've considered the idea to stop watching the show if and when the time comes there's no more book material to refer to - but then I realized the easier thing to do would be stop participating in this forum and other fan forums where debates will rage wildly out of control because everything at that point will be pure speculation with no way to refer to any of the source material. We'll have no idea which things D&D have made up and which things are actual facts GRRM simply hasn't written. I can still satisfy my craving for anything Game of Thrones by watching the show but as soon as I start to debate on the forums, it goes beyond that into frustration territory when anything hasn't been covered in the books yet.
Â 
That's already been happening this season for me. I like solid book references to look back on whenever 'theories' start to go out of control on the forums. I don't mind theories and speculation for the pure enjoyment of the book's mysteries (such as Jon's parentage) - but when you then throw the show's spin on it into the mix, now you've got too many fingers in the pot. Show writers and their idea of events / details vs. GRRM's writing (which may or may not materialize before the show catches up) and on top of that a lot of passionate fan debating and theories. Too much confusion for me! I'll just bow out of the forums and watch the show with a large bag of salt haha.

Â 
Am no, viewers and book readers would not be given the same choice (if this happens), A Game of Thrones was printed in 1996, A Clash of Kings in 1998, A Storm of Swords in 2000, A Feast of Crows in 2005 and A Dance with Dragons in 2011. The show viewers have had 14-18 years to read what will happen, the books readers (if things are going to be spoiled in show), then book readers will have to throw away computers/tvs away and not venture outside until George finish's the books, without getting the books spoiled. And if this is the case then I wish George would have told (me at least) that this is going to happen, then I would have decided to never to read the books in the first place.
Â 
And no I've not read the books from the start, 2004 I did start though. 10 years maybe nothing for you, but it been a hell of a long wait for me. And to have the show finish what George started, would be a massive slap in the face to myself, my friends and many other fans of the books. You know the people who where actually interested and loved the books enough, when HBO where presented with a idea to run the show in the first place, they knew there was going to be a market for it because millions of people already bought the books before the show was ever created.
3192	Miodrag	2014-05-09	Yojimbo,
Â 
Don't know if this is going to be any comfort for you, but I'm not worried at all about consequences of show overpassing the books. Even if you don't find D&D's incompetence is as big as I think it is (and I think it's monumental), it's pretty clear they aren't too interested in telling Martin's story. I mean, they prefer things like Talisa, and Locke, and Natalie Dormer from some earlier phases in her career, and Oberyn from Sex and the City, and white walkers from some cheap monster flicks of the 80s, and so on... Hence, I don't think they're going to spoil anything from AWOW and ADOS. Ever since season 1, they were not spoiling ACOK and ASOS for non-readers, and they're probably going to be even less faithful to the source material once they overpass the books. And, besides, I don't think Martin told them too much about endgame. They probably know broad strokes, but no details. Meaning that, talented as they are, they're probably going to be completely lost once they step on the uncharted territory of AWOW and ADOS.

Well said.
Â 
As much as I like conversing with people who love the story, the constant back and forth of book-readers, non-book-readers, show critics, show fans can be off-putting from time to time.
I like the books, I like watching all the actors growing into their roles/characters, I love the visuals of the show, and yet when I come here to discuss what excited me about the episode ... well, my enthusiasm sours almost immediately.
I try to temper my criticisms, being well aware that I would most likely do far worse in a similar situation to the showrunners ... but then, I'm old and aware of my limitations, so find myself forgiving writers and directors for not seeing a scene the way I imagined it in my head.
Either way, love or hate/like or dislike, people are still talking almost a week later about the episode, so the showrunners are doing something right in the end.

As much as I like conversing with people who love the story, the constant back and forth of book-readers, non-book-readers, show critics, show fans can be off-putting from time to time.
I like the books, I like watching all the actors growing into their roles/characters, I love the visuals of the show, and yet when I come here to discuss what excited me about the episode ... well, my enthusiasm sours almost immediately.
I try to temper my criticisms, being well aware that I would most likely do far worse in a similar situation to the showrunners ... but then, I'm old and aware of my limitations, so find myself forgiving writers and directors for not seeing a scene the way I imagined it in my head.
Either way, love or hate/like or dislike, people are still talking almost a week later about the episode, so the showrunners are doing something right in the end.


Â 
I have emboldened a particularly relevant point to me.Â  I feel like some people just do not know how to enjoy a good thing.Â  Instead, they focus on the one or two things a show does wrong and complain about it ad nauseum, ignoring everything else the series gets right.Â  It's mentally exhausting, but I suppose I do it to myself by coming here to share my enthusiasm.
Â 
I'm not saying the series is perfect, it certainly has flaws.Â  I just feel like most of the time the complaints on these forums can be boiled down to unreasonable expectations on the part of the book reader.
Â 
The only thing the show runners owe us is to produce a series that is honest to their own vision, not ours or even GRRM.Â  We are lucky how much respect has been given to the source material given the fact that it was literally written it to be unfilmable.

Thing is, I don't believe the show runners owe the book readers anything as far as not overtaking them in the story. Â 


Â 
I feel like you're the only one talking about people believing they're owed things anyway. I am pretty sure that most people who find the idea of the show overtaking the books problematic are just expressing their concern.Â 
Â 
Â 


Â 
Â Turn about is fair play since now book readers run the risk of being spoiled in the same way that show-only viewers have been thus far. Â 


Â 

Well I don't know about people here but I've never spoiled anything for show watchers.
Â 
Â 



Â 
Actually, one could argue that the type of spoilers us book readers face are miniscule in comparison to things like my friends being spoiled on the Red Wedding for example.
Â 


Â 

The entire ending of the series is miniscule? The culmination of every event thus fur that people have spent decades discussing and theorising about? Ok then.

I appreciated your previous remarks in reply to my post about quitting the forums once the show has overtaken the books. I just really don't know if I can stomach all the criticisms and wild speculation that goes deeper into crackpot territory every week. Without GRRM's text to ground us, I fear too many people go off on tangents and there's no resolution when you've got nothing 'official' to go by. The show isn't official. It's great for what it is - but it gets frustrating when people are trying to take it literally or even read too much into certain things as definitive clues to their favorite theories.Â 
Â 
But then again, I wouldn't still be here on this forum if I didn't like a little bit of theorycraft anyways. 
Â 
As for the heavy handed criticisms. It's fine to disagree, it's even fine to think certain scenes or actions really stunk if that's your opinion. The problem here is, a lot of people do jump all over you if you actually loved it. That's the part I think quite a few people need to check themselves about and stop arguing.Â 
Â 
I also despise the numerous actor / actress bashing threads. Those are so unnecessary. Those have only started being a problem in this past season or two really. There weren't that many the first couple of seasons and those are the ones people complained about the most with 'new' actors learning new stories and material. The show is doing fabulous and all of the actors are pretty much adored overall by a majority of the fans so the minor few who want to nitpick their every nuance, facial expression or tone of voice (Emilia for example) - well, those people just come across looking like mean spirited jerks to me.

3202	JonDunn	2014-05-04	Really enjoyed how each of the three Cersei scenes was meant for her to work over one of the judges of the trial. The Marg conversation ended with Cersei telling her to talk to her father.
She was quite the chameleon in this episode, actually playing nice with Marg for once and trying to pretend to be the dutiful daughter.
She wants Tyrion pronounced guilty badly.

3204	Emperoreddy	2014-05-04	Watching it again, the scene with Marg was really well done. The "What are you playing at?" looks she kept giving her when she was talking about Joff. You can just tell she felt she was being pulled into a trap. Then when Cercei started to suggest the marriage I wasn't sure if her eyes were going to roll out of her head or vomit the words out of her mouth. Looked like it physically pained her to do it. Then when Marg called her "siser, mother" oh man she wanted to kill her but nearly bit her tongue off.
Â 
I assume the game she is playing is buttering up the judges. Putting the marriage back on makes Mace happy, and she was clearly trying to play up Tywin, being the good daughter, and Obyern too.
Â 
My guess is her sole motivation at the moment is getting revenge on Tyrion by any means necessary, and since Jamie won't do it for her she needs to make sure the judges do it. She wants it so badly she is swallowing a lot of pride.
3205	averde	2014-05-05	It made Cersei look a bit more smart politically while still being stupidly vindictive, I like it. Cersei played on Margaerys hopes of being Queen, Oberyns love of family and want for revenge, and Tywins love of the Lannister legacy. It was good characterization for all the characters and having Tywin be the one to call her out on it was a nice touch.
3206	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-05	Glad to see Cersei and Margaery with their outwardly polite but full of hidden snark relationship, like they have in the books (much better than that "If you ever call me sister again I'll have you strangled in your sleep" fiasco of last season)
Â 
I just hope Cersei will try to seduce Oberyn like she does in the book.
3207	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-05	Mace Tyrell will buy it because he's Mace Tyrell.
Oberyn won't.
Neither will Tywin.
Â 
Either way it was a smart move... which only made me realise how much I don't recognise Cersei from the books here. People talk about how Stannis is ruined, what about Cersei? Isn't she ruined because she's "improved"? It's some sort of political correctness that stop them from make her the hysterical paranoid idiot she actually is?

Â 
The connecting trend in all three conversations is her trying to look like the "poor, victim, grieving mother". All three give her these looks like they don't believe she is doing it. Tywin sort of calls her on it, and comes off he knows what she is doing but can't will himself to care as long as she is being a good daughter.

Â 
IDK because I always got the impression that the "improved" parts was a facade and the real her is the hysterical paranoid idiot that we get increasing glimpses at, and I think it will hit the tipping point when Tyrion escapes.
Â 
She was rather out of control and on full bitch patrol at the wedding, and she has irrationally nasty to Jamie (even beforeÂ  the "rape").

3210	Lord Timothy Lannister	2014-05-05	I feel like many of Cersei's and Dany's flaws are being whitewashed at the moment. I wonder if the show is going to go in a different direction with Cersei than the books? Maybe it's just me but this far into the book series I started to get the feeling she was a little nuts but in the show she seems like a master manipulator and politician.

Â 
But I don't mean only this specific episode. Remember Cersei's conversations about Joffrey, she pretty much wonders why Joffrey is the little shit he was when in books she praised Joffrey's assholery as something Tommen should be.

I feel like they whitewashed Cersei be removing her agency. Joff, not Cersei ordered Robert's vastards deaths. And Cersei won't freely decide to cancel out her debts instead she wilk be forced too since the Lannisters are bankrupt, and then there is Cersei getting raped by Jaime and being forced to marry Loras.

Â 
Very good point. I'm always bitching about how Martin made Cersei look like such a dumbass, mustache-twirling villain, so I'm kind of digging what they've been doing with the character in that regard. I only wish Lena's performance was more like book!Cersei in terms of fiery temper and bitchy snark. She's too cold and serious and reserved, but she's being like that since the pilot so I guess I'll have to accept it.Â

Â 
I mean I agree, she has definitely been toned down and made more sympathetic in the show, but her crazy side is still there in the show too and getting worse and things turn to shit and she drinks more and more. There is definite change, I just still see it getting to the same place.
3215	SkaggCannibal	2014-05-05	Yes Cersei was wonderful this episode, a point of enjoyment troughout. I disagree with the opinions that book Cersei isn't clever enough to pull this off. Cersei is misjudged by people constantly, she's very capable of putting up a facade. We only got to know the real Cersei once we got chapters of her, and the show still isn't at that point yet. I'm sure we'll see more of the real cray-cray Cersei in the future, but Tywin still isn't dead yet and escaped Tyrion not lurking behind every corner.Â  We'll see enough of it eventually.

So basically she's nicer but still stupid, emotional and crazy.
I wish they had kept they had made her smarter and kept the vicious.

Â 
She is smarter in the show too, I think its more her arrogance and paranoia that leads to her "stupidity". And I still think she is pretty vicious, toned down definitely, but she is nasty in a different way (that ice cold bitchy way). I don't know any non book reader that finds her sympathetic. Everyone thought Joff was worse, but I know plenty that can't wait for karma to find its way to her.
Â 
This is also very in character with TV Cersei, its not the first time she used her true emotions as a manipulative tool to try and control people. I recall her pulling this with Ned and ruining it too by pulling a 180 and letting shit slip that she is still nasty.
3218	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-05	So basically she's nicer but still stupid, emotional and crazy.

The viciousness will come.
3219	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	Cersei less vicious? Remember how bitingly vindictive and petty she was at Joffrey's wedding feast.
Â 
If you don't Pycelle, Brienne and Sansa can remind you. Cersei was smiling gleefully during the dwarf play.
3220	Bilbo Baggins	2014-05-05	The show is going a great job of making certain characters more morally ambiguous without losing their bite.
Tywin, while never evil, is much livlier in the show. The help of seeing him outside of a Tyrion POV is good, because he's much less miserable. Charles Dance is also the fucking man, so that helps. And Cersei is a lot more... soft in the show, for want of a better word. To be analogous, book Cersei would get you in her bed and sleep with you. Then bury a knife in your gut very angrily. Show Cersei would playfully seduce you, never revealing more than she needs to, gaining your trust and making you dance to her tune, then slowly slide a blade beneath your ribs. This will change, I have no doubt, but for now I am loving it.

Agreed, I think people are making too many assumptions with this "whitewashing" nonsense. Cersei has shown plenty of pettiness, hypocrisy and signs of being a truly loathsome being (again, Witness her smiling at Joffrey's play). She might still end up causing all types of hell in the future, maybe by destroying the Lannister/Tyrell alliance.

It's definitely there in patches, I think people just have AFFC Cersei so ingrained in their minds that they forget we're not even at that point in the story yet.
3223	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	That too. AFFC Cersei is utterly insane because she A. Lost her son B. Her Father and C. Nobody is there to prevent her from doing whatever the hell she wants. That is a recipe for utter disaster.
3224	TFP	2014-05-05	Important (see affc comments) to remember that an awful lot of weight will fall on cersei's shoulders for the series after this one to be kept watchable. So important to keep cersei as interesting as possible. I think they're doing a good job. Even a slight hint that she'd quite like to trade loras in for oberyn?
3225	Trillian	2014-05-05	I think we'll see the change after Tywin's death.
Yes, for now she's a bit "softer" than in the books (today they definitely added a wee bit of a depression to her character), but I still hear a lot of Unsullied calling her a manipulative raging hooker, so things are fine. Personally, I really like Lena's portrayal of Cersei and the face she made when Margaery expressed her doubts about calling her "mother" or "sister" had me cracking.
3226	avernite	2014-05-05	The bit I found was most interesting was the clear identification of Joffrey as Cersei's first child.
Â 
It continues to amaze Catelyn didn't respond to her 'brown-haired boy' with 'Your grace, if you had a baby before Joffrey the whole realm would know' but oh well
3227	Chebyshov	2014-05-05	Cersei's scenes were the best part of that episode. The fact that people jumped on the "white-washing" train immediately was really confusing. I guess people really don't have faith in the show-runners.
3228	King Theon	2014-05-05	So many people on other threads not grasping that all three scenes were founded on judge manipulation. All three seasons were superb, Tywin calling her out on her efforts was funny too.
Â 
When do people think Loras will take the Kingsguard by the way? Next season, once Tywin's dead? Or this season? Makes more sense to save it for next season in my eyes, although without Tywin there to enforce the wedding what would be the reason for signing up to avoid it?
3229	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-05-05	Her scenes also served several other purposes. Reminding the audience of Myrcella, now that the younger Lannister children are out of Joffrey's shadow, giving some exposition of Dorne, introducing the sand snakes and the water gardens, further shoving the Iron Bank down the show audience's throats, which is something many unsullied will still completely forget about, but it's important to bring up that there must be a face to the Iron Bank, especially with the introduction of Tycho Nestoris next episode, and finally it makes sense for Cersei to propose the marriage to Tommen if she's only doing it to get Mace on her side for the trial. I'm looking forward to Cersei going full bitch-mode on the Tyrells soon though
3230	Tadco26	2014-05-05	It was a smart move by TVCersei to try and manipulate the judges, but it further distanced herself from BookCersei as a character.Â  BookCersei isn't subtle, so having an extended subtle manipulation felt wrong.Â  It's also extremely questionable how much she would have to gain from these subtle manipulations.Â  She doesn't really offer anything to the judges that they weren't lined up to get anyway.Â  Sure she plays the willing participant in her own marriage and Tommen's, but both were likely outcomes with or without her consent.Â  And if/when she returns to full protest in both areas it will be even more jarring, or if she doesn't it will further distances herself from her book counterpart.
3231	Chebyshov	2014-05-05	I love how Marg said her "sister or mother" line...a good call back to last season where Cersei said "if you call me 'sister' again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep." It looked like Marg was obviously testing Cersei here, and Cersei's face right after was priceless. Lena was really, really spot on.
Â 
It's a shame that Show!Cersei is almost definitely going to become unhinged next season. I like this plotting, passive-aggressive Cersei.
3232	Lann Casterly	2014-05-05	I like how she has been portrayed. Â She is doing everything she can to make sure Tyrion dies. Â This is temporary. Â And when everything goes down so will most of her facade.

Considering Loras has done absolutely nothing of note as a Kingsguard, they might just decide that he doesn't join. Loras joined the Kingsguard mostly cause he couldn't get over Renly, this version seems to not have that problem as much.
3234	Natalie Underfoot	2014-05-05	I felt like this was classic Cersei. Only focused on what she wants in the moment: Tyrion's Death. Â I also don't think she was being subtle at all. Cersei in the book's problem is that she was short sighted and convinced she was smarter than she was. Â She makes decisions based on emotions and so although she imagines herself as a female version of Twyin she never gets his results because she can't be detached. I feel like the show captured this Marg saw right through it and was testing her with the "sister and mother' line and gave her what she wanted. Tywin called her on it and Oberyn was looking at her side-eyed a lot. Â She thinks she's pulling off this big coup and all of them are just letting her talk.Â 
Â 
I also find show Cersei to be pretty bad. She wanted Bran killed, there is mention of her having another girl beaten when she was younger and she's pretty casually cruel. Â This is basically how I felt about her in the books too. It's not until AFFC that the prophecy and her paranoia really are unleashed.Â
3235	Sand11751	2014-05-05	Neither version of Cersei is particularly good. I used to think Book Cersei loved her children unconditionally, as with Joff, but with Tommen there's a bit of "I'll love you if you do what I want." There's no way Marg and Oberyn couldn't see through Cersei's act last night. If neither of them, they're both stupid.
3236	~No One~	2014-05-05	I have to agree with all those who have said that we haven't even got into FFC material. The cray-cray will come, oh ye of little faith.
Her "unhinging" moments in the series will be her father dying (they've played up her desire to be daddy's fave so much in the show) and then Tyrion's escape. As soon as Tywin's gone, there'll be no one to make her marry Loras.....notice how her wedding is a fortnight after Tommen's? Tywin'll never make it to then.
She's already distanced from Jamie, and her council is gonna be Pycelle, whom she hates, and who knows who else. She's already started her trip to Drunkentown, and as soon as she starts to see Marge's manipulation, she'll fully flip out. They even put in that scene where she steps between Tommy and Margey in this episode. 
Groundwork for batsh*t crazy hitting the fan is there, people. S5 will be Lena's time to shine. I for one, can't wait.
3237	Gail	2014-05-05	Can't wait for batshitcrazyCersei next season. But like what the others said, her scenes have good purpose.
1)judge manipulation
2)information dump for future episodes/seasons(IB, Myrcella, Sand snakes, Dorne)
3)better Cersei downfall.
Â 
And also, I don't believe that Cersei was obviously incompetent and crazy on GOT to SOS. Though people know she doesn't know how to control power=King Jeoffrey.

I think Atia of the Julii from HBO's Rome is closer to BookCersei. It's unfortunate that TVCersei isn't more like her.
If you haven't seen Rome, I recommend it. Here is the character description for Atia:
Niece of Caesar, Atia of the Julii is snobbish, willful, cunning, and sexually voracious. In a culture in which women lack formal power and men leave for years on military campaigns, the wives, daughters, and mothers have built powerful networks and alliances completely independent of the men's worlds. Atia is among the women who serve as the shadow rulers of Rome.
Atia is greedy and ambitious, and will do virtually anything to get what she wants. Seduction, humiliation and violence (including murder) are all tools acceptable to her; Atia's occasional hypocrisy is overshadowed by her general acceptance of her own extremely corrupt and unethical nature.
Fiercely protective of her family and their social status, Atia's motives usually involve advancement or self-preservation for the Julii. Her manipulations often extend to her own relatives; feeling that she knows best, Atia will not let even her children thwart her plans.
Â 
Â 
Replace Julii with Lannister and you get a near perfect adaptation of BookCersei.Â  TV viewers shouldn't be asking themselves who the villain is that replaces Joffrey because Cersei shouldÂ have been right up there with himÂ thru this point of the story in her ownÂ ways.Â
3239	Lord_Dustin	2014-05-05	Something to notice about Cersei this week:
Â 
She only takes two sips of wine throughout the entire episodeÂ and she doesn't finish the glass that her father gave her before leaving.
Â 
I think these scenes could become an important counterpoint to the type of plotting that we are going to see next season. Â Even last week she was drunk during her confrontation with Jaime.
3240	RoamingRonin	2014-05-05	I love how Marg said her "sister or mother" line...a good call back to last season where Cersei said "if you call me 'sister' again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep." It looked like Marg was obviously testing Cersei here, and Cersei's face right after was priceless. Lena was really, really spot on.
Â 
It's a shame that Show!Cersei is almost definitely going to become unhinged next season. I like this plotting, passive-aggressive Cersei.


Â 
This this so much this. Natalie and Lena must have good chemistry on set because they are getting better and better in their scenes together.Â 

If written well, Lena could land an Emmy for what goes down in the future. There's a lot of good material for her character. Â

Â 
Her agent nominated her, not the show.
3243	fangirl000	2014-05-06	Watching it again, the scene with Marg was really well done. The "What are you playing at?" looks she kept giving her when she was talking about Joff. You can just tell she felt she was being pulled into a trap. Then when Cercei started to suggest the marriage I wasn't sure if her eyes were going to roll out of her head or vomit the words out of her mouth. Looked like it physically pained her to do it. Then when Marg called her "siser, mother" oh man she wanted to kill her but nearly bit her tongue off.
Â 
I assume the game she is playing is buttering up the judges. Putting the marriage back on makes Mace happy, and she was clearly trying to play up Tywin, being the good daughter, and Obyern too.
Â 
My guess is her sole motivation at the moment is getting revenge on Tyrion by any means necessary, and since Jamie won't do it for her she needs to make sure the judges do it. She wants it so badly she is swallowing a lot of pride.


Â 
Oberyn: There will be a trial and we'll find out the truth
Cersei: There will be a trial...
Â 
That right there is all you need to know about Cersei's plans.Â
3244	coppersam	2014-05-06	Absolutely agree that Cersei is NOT being whitewashed. Â The only possible way you can truly believe that is to completely miss the fact that these scenes were not random conversations revealing moments of real human emotion weakness; she was manipulating the judges. Â I was shocked to see that this was missed by a lot of bloggers and writers reviewing the episode. Â My non-book reading roommate commented on how Joff's death has changed Cersei for the better. Â Um, no. Â This is Cersei being her Cersei-ist. Â She is using her loss as a tool to get what she wants. Â We are still in sneaky Cersei mode. Â After Tywin gets capped on the crapper, season 5 will shift gears into crazy Cersei mode. Â Like so many of you have already pointed out, we are not in AFFC yet (for Cersei's arc at least). Â She is right on track, and Lena Headey is doing a FANTASTIC job, might I add. Â I actually don't think I noticed just how complex Cersei's character was until this season, watching Headey do her thing.
3245	DaveyJoe	2014-05-06	Yeah, it's interesting how that scene seemed to go over a lot of people's heads, especially since the show has been criticized for its lack of subtlety.Â
3246	Emperoreddy	2014-05-06	Something to notice about Cersei this week:

Â 
You think they will play up her drinking as a big catalyst for the stupid stuff she does? I've been wondering how they will portray Cersei next season, and I feel like PW gave us some hints on how it will look. Her lashing at Pycelle, then ordering the feast to the dogs just to spite the Tyrells and flash some power. The little gleeful smile she has when its done this "I'm a bitch and I love it" look.
Â 
Also her plays this week weren't so much about giving the judges what they want, but more an attempt to paint herself as the victim and a sympathetic person. The Tyrells know Cersei was completely against Marg's marriage, but her presenting the new marriage is an attempt to show "she has changed" as well as admitting the stuff about Joff. I think Marg see's through it in the end and that is why she brought up the marriage to Loras and the digs of calling her both sister AND mother, which you could tell she LOATHED hearing. She is giving Tywin the daughter he wants, a daughter that puts "family first" by setting the dates. He sees right through it though. She is trying to come off as the bleeding heart mourning mother to Oberyn. Trying to relate and show they aren't that different.
Â 
Next week I imagine she drops the hammer just painting Tyrion as a child killer and her the poor victim mother.
3247	Chebyshov	2014-05-06	Next week I imagine she drops the hammer just painting Tyrion as a child killer and her the poor victim mother.

It does make you wonder what's up with the boat that Cersei is sending to Myrcella...is it just a motherly gift or is there something more to it?Â
3251	Widows_Blood	2014-05-06	Cersei is one of the few characters made much better on the show. She inhibits all the paranoia and vindictiveness that made her so hated in the books but she also garners some sympathy in that she isn't a complete caricature like she is in the books. People here always bitch about D&D not being able to write grey characters or that they lack subtlety, yet show Cersei is a perfect example of that. Her scenes in the last episode oozed subtlety and subtext. I loved the look she gave Margarey when she pretended not to think about "what happens next" regarding Joffs death. It was a look of pure daggers and hate. I bet if we had a window into her inner monologue she would be calling Marg a "little bitch" or something to that effect. Â
3252	lostinwesteros	2014-05-06	I love how Marg said her "sister or mother" line...a good call back to last season where Cersei said "if you call me 'sister' again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep."

Â 
It's a shame that Show!Cersei is almost definitely going to become unhinged next season. I like this plotting, passive-aggressive Cersei.

Also reminiscent of those hilarious musings of QoT at Tyrion-Sansa (TV) wedding as to the convoluted family relationships about to be forged.
3253	Tixu Oty	2014-05-07	I don't think Cersei is white-washed, but I didn't get her scenes, and apparently a lot of people didn't get it either, which to me means it could have been better done. Now I realize that yes, it was all an act, because it's the explanation that makes the most sense, but I still think it was poorly done. I think Lena Headey is fantastic, and Cersei is a wonderful villain in the show and in the books. I'm fully aware that we're not at the point where she turns batshit crazy yet, and I realize and apreciate that show Cersei is more subtle and grey than her book counterpart. Yet I still think it was poorly done.
Â 
And as a previous poster said, what exactly is the point of this manipulation?? Cersei is not offering anything new anything at all to the judges. She's just playing nice, that's all, but nothing's changed. Also, no counterpart is ever implied, Tyrion's trial is barely brought up. In retrospect I sorta can put the pieces together, but I'm still not convinced.
Maybe it would have worked better if there had been an additional scene before those three where Cersei reflects on the trial or on her absence of choice concerning Tommen's upcoming wedding. Just let us know that no, she's still not happy about it, but she gets that for now, she can't do a thing about it. Or maybe just let us know that the trial is coming before Tommen's wedding, that way we can suspect that Cersei might change her mind later?
There's also the fact that Mace remains a background character, and if those three scenes were meant to be Cersei sucking up to the judges then I have a problem with that. Maybe Cersei should have spoken to Marg AND Mace, or maybe Marg could have reported to Mace afterwards and wondered what the hell was up with that (although that sort of questioning would have worked much better with Olenna...). Or maybe just showing Mace totally buying it and making it clear that he's backing Cersei and Tywin with no question would have been enough. Come to think of it, that would have been hilarious. Just show satisfied Mace and suspicious Marg and there you go.
Â 
I mean, I like the show to be subtle, but to me this was too subtle to work. And maybe my ideas are not very subtle but hey I'm not a writer. Still I'm sure they could have found a way to make it work better.
Â 


It's definitely there in patches, I think people just have AFFC Cersei so ingrained in their minds that they forget we're not even at that point in the story yet.


Â 
It's not that, It's that show Cersei seems a little all over the place. If it's because she's putting up an act, all of a sudden, give us some kind of a hint.
Â 


So many people on other threads not grasping that all three scenes were founded on judge manipulation. All three seasons were superb, Tywin calling her out on her efforts was funny too.


Â 
Actually I've been wondering, some scenes a lot of Unsullied don't get right away because they lack background information, like the Lysa revealing that she poisoned Jon. A lot of unsullied do get it, but it's obviously easier for book readers. This time I didn't get it despite the fact that I read the book. Which makes me wonder if I didn't get it in spite of the books, but because of the books. Did the Unsullied have more or less problems getting that scene?? I know my unsullied sis hates Cersei. She hasn't seen the episode yet, but I have a feeling she's going to suspect Cersei is putting up an act because come on Cersei's evil and she can't do a thing right.
I'm confused.
Â 


Oberyn: There will be a trial and we'll find out the truth
Cersei: There will be a trial...
Â 
That right there is all you need to know about Cersei's plans.Â 


Â 
I must be really thick, I don't get that line either.
Â 


 
I have a feeling her motivation for her actions in this episode will be made quite clear next week.


Â 
If that's the case, I'll forgive it all :-p
Â 


So has Cersei stashed a Kingsguard onboard that cog to whisk Mycerlla away from Dorne?


Â 
Well I did wonder what was up with that ship.

3254	Wunhopkuendo	2014-05-07	I felt like this was classic Cersei. Only focused on what she wants in the moment: Tyrion's Death. Â I also don't think she was being subtle at all. Cersei in the book's problem is that she was short sighted and convinced she was smarter than she was. Â She makes decisions based on emotions and so although she imagines herself as a female version of Twyin she never gets his results because she can't be detached. I feel like the show captured this Marg saw right through it and was testing her with the "sister and mother' line and gave her what she wanted. Tywin called her on it and Oberyn was looking at her side-eyed a lot. Â She thinks she's pulling off this big coup and all of them are just letting her talk.Â 
Â 
I also find show Cersei to be pretty bad. She wanted Bran killed, there is mention of her having another girl beaten when she was younger and she's pretty casually cruel. Â This is basically how I felt about her in the books too. It's not until AFFC that the prophecy and her paranoia really are unleashed.Â 


I think you nailed it there, as well as pretty much every single woman character Martin writes. They are all emotional, rash, impetuous, save perhaps Arya who isn't a woman quite yet. The tv version adds so much more to Cersei and indeed all the characters because they are being played by actual human beings and have the ability to bring so much more humanity to the table.Â
3255	MoA«t	2014-05-07	Yes Cersei was wonderful this episode, a point of enjoyment troughout. I disagree with the opinions that book Cersei isn't clever enough to pull this off. Cersei is misjudged by people constantly, she's very capable of putting up a facade. We only got to know the real Cersei once we got chapters of her, and the show still isn't at that point yet. I'm sure we'll see more of the real cray-cray Cersei in the future, but Tywin still isn't dead yet and escaped Tyrion not lurking behind every corner.Â  We'll see enough of it eventually.

This! Â And this:

Oberyn's line indicates that the purpose of the trial is to discover the truth of whether Tyrion poisoned Joffrey.
Â 
But Cersei's line, by agreeing only that there will be a trial, implies that she doesn't care about the whole "finding the truth" part of the proceedings. Â In the context of her conversations with Jamie and Tywin, Cersei's mindset is clear - she is convinced that Tyrion is the person who poisoned Joff, and she is not going to let this trial have any other outcome than GUILTY.Â

Â 
I get that. But to me, saying "there will be a trial" and obliterating that last part about the truth sounds like someone who doesn't care about the truth, not like someone who feels they already know the truth. I mean yes it can be interpreted that way, and you gotta interpret it that way because you've known Cersei as a character since season 1 and we've had several scenes that establish she's convinced of Tyrion's guilt. Still, to me, the most obvious way to interpret it, is well, there's this trial, but that doesn't mean we'll get to know the truth. I think the writer just wanted Cersei to reply something seemingly witty and have the last word, cuz yeah, that does sound like her. But I find it unnecessarily confusing.

3258	We Pay Our Debts	2014-05-09	Â 
But I don't mean only this specific episode. Remember Cersei's conversations about Joffrey, she pretty much wonders why Joffrey is the little shit he was when in books she praised Joffrey's assholery as something Tommen should be.


Â 
But you have to remember that Joffrey is less of an asshole in the books as well. In the show, he treats Cersei like crap and Cersei loses control over him, while in the books, he listens to her and respects her in his own way.
3259	We Pay Our Debts	2014-05-09	Absolutely agree that Cersei is NOT being whitewashed.

Â 
Um, no. Cersei was, and is indeed whitewashed. In the show, she never tries to have Robert's bastards killed (It doesn't even make sense why Joffrey would care about Robert's bastards), she never sent Mandon Moore after Tyrion, she's far nicer to Sansa, she says she's shocked by what Joffrey did, and her relationship with Tyrion is less antagonistic. But to be fair, Tyrion is also whitewashed, and Joffrey was made a lot more evil (I personally dislike both changes).
Â 
I personally don't mind Cersei being made more sympathetic (I loath some of her characterization in AFFC, particularly Maggy the Frog), but I personally hate how she loses control of Joffrey and breaks down in front of Tyrion about how horrible Joffrey is. Book Cersei is way stronger than that. She would not stand for that treatment by Joffrey in the books.
Â 
I wish they made her more sympathetic in other ways, perhaps by playing up her abuse at the hands of Robert. But I did like how she showed concern for Myrcella in this episode. I hated how GRRM made Cersei care so little for her. I understand that she's supposed to love her children as extensions of herself, but that doesn't mean that she can't care about the well-being of all her children, regardless of where they are. I think he went too far with Cersei's evilness (the scene where she punishes Tommen was so over the top IMO), as well as with her incompetence. I understand that Cersei isn't meant to be a great leader and is not as smart as she thinks she is, but she fell out of power WAY too fast. I wonder how things would've went with Cersei if he kept the 5 year time-skip.
Â 
Â 
In the end, Cersei from aGoT-aSoS is my favorite characterization of Cersei.

3260	King Zee	2014-05-09	What the episode proved to me was that many, perhaps most bookreaders would have been outwitted by Cersei.
3261	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-09	I think you nailed it there, as well as pretty much every single woman character Martin writes.

Â 
Â 
In actual fact, Arya is one of the more emotional characters - disciplined, calculating up to a point, but she is defined by her emotions. They just aren't usually "soft" emotions, but often sharp nasty ones.
Â 
I have to disagree with the spirit of this criticism as well - I have heard this assertion made in relation to the books before.
Â 
Are the men any less emotional ? You would be hard pressed to find examples of male characters in it that are unemotional - aside from Roose (whose unique trait seems to be his lack of any), they tend to be just as emotional as the women.
Tywin, Petyr Baelish, Bran, Eddard, Jon, Robb, Quentyn Martell, Viserys, Jaime, Tyrion, Ramsay, Doran Martell, Stannis. Who rashly married some girl he slept with ? Who took Winterfell, then stayed there when all hope was gone, all to prove himself to a fool? Who poured out his years of angst to a foe who looked on him with contempt, then turned back to rescue her from a bear when he could have let her die? Who deserted the battlefield, then drunkenly stumbled into a girl's room, unclear of his own intentions? 
	Spoiler Who sailed across the world to spite the brother who always stole what was his ? Who raged up at his best friend for forgetting his honour when he put on the crown? Who slew his own father upon learning one unimaginably horrible secret? 
 The men of ASOIAF, that's who.

Â 
Really ? Â seems to me Cersei never denied those accusations, just stayed silent and let Tyrion draw his own conclusions
Â 


She said that 'Joffrey did what needed to be done' in regards to the bastards. And the producers said they changed the scene and gave the crime to Joffrey (stupid right?).
3269	We Pay Our Debts	2014-05-11	Cersei was behind it in the books? That is definite?


Â 
Neither are confirmed in the books. With the bastard killing, it makes sense for Cersei to be behind it, and I don't see how anyone else would benefit from it. People argue that she never talks about either actions in her POV, but she also never mentions other important actions from aGoT to aSoS, such as Tyrion's threat towards Tommen, and his assault of her during the same scene.
Â 
Her involvement with Ser Mandon Moore's attempt on Tyrion's life during the Battle of Blackwater is more vague, however.
3270	PhoenixFlame	2014-05-11	I loved Cersei's scenes last episode! To me she was using kernels of real emotion as playing cards. If you're being manipulative, it's easier to sound sincere when they're a little truth mixed in. Also, Tyrion's death seems to be the one thing she'll swallow her pride and play nice to accomplish. When she played the "dutiful lady," Tywin even opened up to her about the realm's finances and Oberyn and Margaery seemed unsure of what to do. If she'd gone that route way earlier, maybe she could've manipulated her way into much more authority. This isn't a "the story shoulda been written different" comment, just an observation how Cersei, as a person, really wasted and misused her potential.

3272	Chebyshov	2014-05-04	How/when are we going to get his betrayal? I'm assuming Dany has to banish him soon, but are we going to get to it this season? Could Quentyn possible be the one to bring news of his spying (seems very unlikely, but I'm not sure how else it will happen).
3273	shiola	2014-05-04	I wonder if it'll even happen at this point. Â D&D said they are fine with killing off characters at different times than their deaths in the novels, so I have my own theory that Jorah never gets banished and just kinda dies, and Tyrion finds a different way to Dany. Â I don't have a good reason for this prediction, but that's my two cents. Â 
Â 
However they reveal the betrayal, it'll probably seem contrived compared to how it goes down in the books.

Doesn't make a lot of sense to have the character disappear for a long time from a TV story-telling perspective, IMO.

I thought the reason could have been to show to the audience why JorahÂ doesn't get found out. Â If Barristan wasn't on the small council, he can't out the news to Dany.
3284	stunningsteve	2014-05-04	Next weeks preview shows how Tywin and the small council discuss that Dany is staying at Mereen. So Jorah is propably still sending letters to Varys. I guess that Ser Barristan somehow catches him while writing/sending one and reveals it to Dany.

Â 
Â 
He's definitely not still reporting on her. Â He already got the pardon-- there's no need to report because there's nothing for him to gain. Â Dany's going around burning cities and murdering slavers? Â Yeah, Westeros'll find out pretty damn quick. Â
3286	Darth Pipes	2014-05-04	This is just speculation...Jorah could have sent a letter to Varys as a way of getting the heat off of Dany and assuring them she was no risk.Â  But I can't imagine Jorah continuing to write Varys letters this late in the game.
Â 
Speaking of changes, we never got the scene where Jorah kisses Dany.

It's going to happen. We saw Dany hold Jorah back after a council meeting for more counsel. That's part of the set up for his betrayal.

Yes! And today's "counselor Jorah" scene is there for a reason as well. It's coming; just don't know when.
Â

And Lysa too, I know.
Â 
But who knows? Maybe it's in Iain Glen's contract that he's got to be in "x" number of episodes per season or something like that. It's always tricky with actors' contracts and that sort of thing.


The reason has to do with casting not the characters. Barristan and Lysa's actors were not starring cast members before their hiatus. Iain Glen is. It's the same reason we still see Theon and Bran in the show.
3288	Longspear Ryk	2014-05-04	i was under the impression Jorah kept writing to Varys......Â

That is a good point but I can't see another reasonable way for Dany to discover his treason. It was clearly stated that Barristan was not present during council meetings in the show so he they can't go the same way as in the books. Actually another way could be some warning from Quaithe. But there would be no real reason for Dany to trust her. They didn't meet in the show, did they? If I remember correctly she only spoke to Jorah.

Â 
Yep. This is exactly what I thought. Since Glen has been a regular since season 1, I think this is why he can't/won't be gone for long (assuming Dany does banish him at some point, naturally).

3295	Daenerys Must Die	2014-05-04	They did it to Barristan though


Â 
Yeah but he's old.
Â 
Also didn't Barristan say something to Jorah last season alluding to the fact that he knew about Jorah's sending information? At least it was implied.. Barristan looked to be a little peeved/gave Jorah a look when KHALEESI / BREAKER OF CHAINS asked everyone to leave except Ser jorah.. Now Barry isn't one to throw someone under the bus even if people are being burned alive but still could be something to that.
3296	A Man Is A Man	2014-05-04	Â I get the feeling that they are avoiding Jorah's banishment because they tend to avoid ANYTHING that might make Dany look unsympathetic.Â
3297	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-05	Bringing this here:

seems like next episode the small counsel learns of dany's conquest. must be through jorah... this should be the set up of the betrayal and exile. might be fun.Â
3298	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-05-05	Obviously Ian Glen is too awesome and smooth to be banished. He might not be banished at all. I wouldn't care, the guy's awesome; he just needs screen-time, that's all. But yeah, they've already made it clear Barristan can't be the one to snitch on him, and he's in pretty deep with Dany at this point, so I'm really worried they're gonna half-ass his pseudo-betrayal. I dunno if it'll happen or when, but if it does it better be good and realistic.

Did this really happen? I don't remember it. Why would Brienne from Tarth know about a Northern lord being a slaver or bring it up in conversation with Pod, who was the only character in her scenes this episode?

I agree with this. 
Maybe her refusal of the kiss will instigate him yelling something how's he's been loyal to her the longest, Barristan says no Jorah hasn't and reveals Jorah's letters to Varys, boom exiled.
3301	JonCon's Red Beard	2014-05-05	I've just realised something...
spoiler for Dance
	Spoiler Maybe Jorah still communicates with Varys because he knows or thinks Varys now actually wants or intends to help her, a way for us to know that Varys is up to and preparing us for the next season when Aegon will be known. Dany obviously, doesn't believe him. Or maybe Jorah only knows part of it. He knows he's helping but he doesn't know how.
3302	Dragon of Valyria	2014-05-05	Honestly -- who knows? I feel like they were setting it up with his conversation with her, and strange unwillingness to have her invade Westeros but they've changed enough at this point that it's hard to predict.
3303	Gneisenau	2014-05-05	With Grey Worm and Missandei talking about their origins, maybe a slave will recognize Jorah as the one who sold him/her ?
3304	CandleWisps	2014-05-05	It's too late for my mind to speculate how they're going to do it, but I'm positive that they are going to do it nonetheless. It has been set up remarkably so far imo
3305	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-05	They've been laying the groundwork for it. I'm guessing they'll want to save it for the final episode, so there's a culmination of things beginning to crumble for Dany - Hazzea's death, chaining of dragons, and Jorah's betrayal and banishment. Rather than a victorious season ending for Dany, it will be quite the opposite to what's expected.
Â 
Besides, there's a shot in one of the season previews (perhaps the Foreshadowing) where Jorah's standing at the foot of the throne while Dany, Barristan and Grey Worm all look down on him. I'll eat my hat if that isn't the scene.
3306	Tyrion1991	2014-05-05	Next weeks preview shows how Tywin and the small council discuss that Dany is staying at Mereen. So Jorah is propably still sending letters to Varys. I guess that Ser Barristan somehow catches him while writing/sending one and reveals it to Dany.


Â 
Â 
That would be a stupid move for HBO to be doing.
Â 
Jorah from the books stops doing this at Qaarth with the reports to Varys because his perception of Dany changes. Jorah in the books is a much more darker, difficult and problem character in Danys arc; he is also much more questioning of her as a leader. Plus, in the books it takes longer for him to be truly in love with Dany.Â 
Â 
There is NO character motivation for show Jorah to still be sending reports to Varys. It would make no sense whatsoever. He is clearly 100% on Danys side and they have made no effort since season 1 to shy away from that; with no indications as to why he would continue sending reports. Basically it would be super contrived and the only reason they would do this is give Dany a better reason to exile him.Â
3307	Tyrion1991	2014-05-05	They've been laying the groundwork for it.

Â 
I doubt its that scene because you see it from a different angle and Danys face almost looks amused. Plus, if she knew he was a spy then he would be in chains or restrained in some way. They would not be letting him walk about none the worse for wear.Â 
Â 
Maybe he is in the shit for some other reason.
3308	Envie	2014-05-05	This is a good debate and I've seen compelling arguments both ways as to whether or not Jorah will be banished. I think they would have to get rid of him eventually somehow because he has to end up meeting Tyrion down the road - that seems like a pretty important part of his story as well as Tyrion's, no?
Â 
As for whether or not he's still spying on Dany in the show, I say no way. Yes, he already received a 'pardon' and he's clearly 100% in Dany's camp and has been for a long time. The only thing I can think of is that belated word gets to Dany that he WAS spying on her to King's Landing later on at some point and she banishes him for betraying her even though he's been loyal to her ever since. Dany won't forget or forgive him.
Â 
Lastly, it's funny how he was 'spying' on her to Varys but isn't Varys actually on the Targaryen side anyways? I mean the guy helps Tyrion get to Pentosh and Illyrio and then has him going to find Dany anyways so when it all comes full circle, that 'spying' was actually to Dany's benefit anyways wasn't it?
3309	Tyrion1991	2014-05-05	With Grey Worm and Missandei talking about their origins, maybe a slave will recognize Jorah as the one who sold him/her ?

He has no motivation to continue spying on Daenerys. Theres a big difference between a shock revelation for Dany which we are totally aware of and a reveal which feels contrived and makes no sense. What does Jorah possibly get out of continuing to spy on Dany at this point in the story? Hes obviously devoted to her and with her army and dragons she has every chance of taking the throne. Such a reveal would make no sense and be contrived.

Yeah probably, but he could be playing both sides to ensure hisÂ return to Westeros - but that seems so unlike showJorah. Â But if Jorah dies this season, big spoilers for the ultimate fate of book Jorah as well.Â  Ahhhhh :-( .
3315	Batman	2014-05-05	I think it'll happen during Dany's last appearance this season (ep. 9 or 10). Then Tyrion finds him in that brothel midway through season 5.

Probably need to do it for Sandor too (if they don't change that too).Â
3316	SlowLoras	2014-05-05	It's going to have a bigger impact when Jorah does eventually get banished because he's a great deal more likeable and sympathetic on the show - his love for Danaerys is portrayed in a much less creepy way, too (I suppose, in part, because she's been aged up some.)
Â 
So I suspect there'll be a few scenes showing Jorah and Dany interacting, interspersed with scenes in which she grows closer to Daario, and that's when it'll happen. On what pretext, I don't know. Maybe Jorah finally gets round to declaring his love and she sends him away, but I can't see that - I think a lot of people are rooting for Jorah on the quiet and something like that would make Dany look a little ruthless and cruel. I can't see the showrunners rolling with that.
3317	Natalia Borgia	2014-05-05	Tyrion and Dany white washing is now par for the course. I tend to separate them in my mind as Peter Dinklage in cosplay and Dany/Emilia. That said their relation to Jorah will change. Dany is going to banish Jorah- the reveal is coming from who knows but for the sake of the show it will be Tyrion escaping and Jorah's banishment within the same 2 episode arc.
Â 
Just a guess based on the show vs book timelines.Â
3318	Natalia Borgia	2014-05-05	And in the books Jorah had ceased spying on her at this point- had not been an informer since Qarth but Dany will still be totally pissed- he spied on her even after she felt she could really trust him and he was her best buddy in the Khalasar.Â 
Varys knows a lot of people in the free cities- he was getting reports from them. I am guessing this of course.Â
3319	Laniki	2014-05-05	What about the Hound?

The Hound was Joffrey's dog and I don't remember him going to Small Council meetings. Last season, after Sandor left KL was the first that Joff finds out that Dany has dragons. When Joff asks Tywin about it, it seemed as if the information they had was second hand from sailors. Plot wise, for the Hound to travel to Essos to find the (I can't remember if it was the Golden Co. or the Second Sons) sellsword company, then find his way to Meereen and then be welcomed by Selmy to inform on Jorah is hard to visualize. Especially if Jorah is later to find his way back across Essos, to meet up with Tyrion. Â Maybe, as the HBO story is an adaptation of the story ASoIaF, the writers take liberty to change character qualities and who does what to appease the viewers expectations and how actors want to be perceived. By doing that they can write anything they want and as unlikely as it may be, Sandor might inform on Jorah.
3320	~No One~	2014-05-05	What if they played up the Barristan-Jorah antagonistic relationship? There is groundwork for it from S3, even though they haven't really touched on it this season. 
Or maybe the Daario-Jorah thing. Was Jorah the one to bring up Joff's death? Maybe Daario could ask him how he knew, or something. 
I'm convinced it'll happen. It's such beautiful poetic justice that the slaver becomes a slave. And also, Tyrion needs a sidekick!
3321	Onna Lewyys	2014-05-05	The reason has to do with casting not the characters. Barristan and Lysa's actors were not starring cast members before their hiatus. Iain Glen is. It's the same reason we still see Theon and Bran in the show.

Aidan Gillen is a starring cast member, and he disappeared for 6 episodes. They can do the same with Iain Glen.
3322	Hielo y Fuego	2014-05-05	Aidan Gillen is a starring cast member, and he disappeared for 6 episodes. They can do the same with Iain Glen.

If Jorah's banished in ep. 9 or 10 this season, and comes back midway through the next season (like I believe), he'd be gone for 5, 6 eps. too. Lysa and Barristan were gone for well over a season each.
3323	Chebyshov	2014-05-05	The only thing I can think is that Barry will still be the one to do it, and has simply been withholding this information (not sure how he learned it, given his lack of SC presence, but who knows).

Â

If I'm not mistaken, Barristan was present when Varys tells Ned "those birds have flown", right after Ned tells him to cancel the order to assassinate Dany. If that's the case, then it has to be for this purpose alone.

Yeah it seems to me they don't want Dany's character misinterpreted and keeping her 'reserved' for love only. In fact I doubt she kisses Hizdahr (I had to look up that spelling!) at all since it was a short-lived political marriage at most. If Dany kisses Jorah now, and then starts up her love affair with Dhaario, she'll look 'slutty' to some viewers and they don't want that at all - Dany's one of the 'pure' characters they've been building up thus far. In fact they are downplaying her mistakes a lot. I hesitate to say 'whitewashing' her character, she's always been pretty white but she has gone down the darker path in Meereen and I just don't see them taking her there on the show.
3331	Onna Lewyys	2014-05-05	I still think the kiss will happen. Likely in the episode right before she finds out about his betrayal, or even at the beginning of that same episode.
3332	King of the Road	2014-05-05	I bet he still has the royal pardon he was given in Season 1.
3333	Tyrion1991	2014-05-05	I feel like that opportunity was lost in the much-bemoaned season 2, and even season 3 somewhere (like on the ship, where it shoulda happened!). Dany is gonna be kissing Hizzle fo Shizzle and Daario. I guess D&D drew a line at Jorah.


Â 
It would be a really difficult scene to film and the show has a bad track record with ambiguity and what they meant; lacking the internal POV. Either they would make it look like Jorah sexually assaulted Dany or that she actually was interested in him.
Â 
Â 
They MIGHT, I must stress might, do it in episode 7. This is where Dany has sex with Daario by the look of the episode description. They could be trying to mirror what happens in ASOS where he kisses her but she then seeks sexual comfort with Irri (?); only instead they replace her with Daario. Or, they could have him kiss her AFTER shes already laid waste to Daario. I think Ian Glen said something at a recent premiere about picking the right moment to tell Dany something. Doing it after she is clearly with Daario would definetly count as a bad time...Â
3334	MercyTheBlindUglyLittleCat	2014-05-05	He'll be banished, the writers will want to do Jorah and Tyrion travels next season. I don't know how they'll make it work at this point. My guess will be a whole new plot reason and betrayal (unintentional) will be created, and then Barristan will reveal that he does know a bit about Jorah's deals with Robert, thus sending Dany over the edge.

See bolded part.... you don't think they'll make her follow her path to the dark side in S5? Interesting. I can see it going either way, because they love to "purify" Dany & Tyrion, but isn't this integral for Dany next series? I mean, what does she do, if not make bad decision, followed by bad decision, etc.?

Yeah I know it's a bit off topic since the thread is about Ser Jorah's part in the story but it does tie in with Dany since of course now we have no real idea what they're going to do with her plot in Meereen going forward. Everything's up to the writer's interpretation at this stage because if they stick to the books entirely then we're all left hanging. If they improvise on the story or change it in any way then everyone's assuming there's a different ending.
Â 
But no, I don't see them making Dany nearly as dark as she was in the books during her Meereen phase. They're already making her a lot more innocent and even her self questioning of how she can possibly rule comes off sounding like her circumstances are to blame and not her ability to make good leadership decisions.
3338	Stone Cold Bastard	2014-05-05	If Jorah is going to be banished, it could be possibly due to him taking the initiative and chaining up the dragons, after the farmer brings his child's bones to Dany.
Â 
That scene with Jorah and Barriston from last season seemed to indicate that Barristan knew nothing about Jorah's previous spying.

Â 
No ruler in ASoIaF has made that many good decisions so far. Absolutely no one. The one who came closest was Jon, and even he made a huge mistake by assuming that he could impose his will on veteran NW members who had been taught that the Wildlings were the enemy they were supposed to fight all along.
Â 
At least Dany's managed to stay alive, unlike Robert, Robb, Renly, Joffrey, Balon, the Old Bear and even Jon (as far as we know).

I pray to the Old Gods and the New that this isn't what happens. It's necessary to Dany's caharcter development and hopefully her continued development to chain up the dragons on her own command. Locking her children away has major repercussions for her as a ruler and a Targaryen , so I hope Jorah doesn't do it. That would make him overly anxious to please her (not that he isn't anyways though...)

Off topic but gods I hope they don't completely wash her. Her experiences all cultivate in her disappearance and wanderings in the Great Grass Sea. I want darker!Dany so, hopefully, if she does come out of the Dothraki Sea she has learned her lessons and finally gets her ass moving with the knowledge she can't please everyone.

Â 
I feel it should still happen for Jorah's characterization. Eh, it might make him look like a creeper, but even all the Unsullied watchers know he's practically head over heels for his Khaleesi, so I doubt it would shock them overly much if he makes a move. How it happens in regard to timing I'm not sure I care about much, i just would prefer it happen eventually before his banishment. It would make sense she goes to seek comfort in Daario, but she could even banish Jorah first and then go seek comfort in Daario for her 'loss'.
3342	Dornish Hen	2014-05-05	Â 
But who knows? Maybe it's in Iain Glen's contract that he's got to be in "x" number of episodes per season or something like that. It's always tricky with actors' contracts and that sort of thing.

I noticed this week in the opening credits that Iain Glen is the only main actor to be listed as "With Iain Glen".  I don't know anything about actors and contracts, but I wondered if it had anything to do with Jorah being banished.  Could that be a clue as to show Jorah's future?

A "With" or "And" credit is a special thing some actors' agents lobby for if the actor is a notable name but isn't able to be listed first in the credits. In S1 Peter Dinklage had the special "With" credit because obviously Sean Bean was listed first.

Ahhh.   It just seemed out of place to me with all the other opening credits. Almost like he wasn't equal to the other actors.  And I never noticed the season 1 credits.  I was too busy looking at the sigils.

Â 
I'm almost positive the whole Jorah banishment thing is related to Glen's contract, other filming commitments, etc. But I don't think Jorah will be gone for more than half a season (assuming Dany does banish him at all, that is).
Â 
I guess how many episodes he may be gone is entirely dependent on what D&D are planning to do with Tyrion's journey in Essos. I think it could be just 3, 4 eps. before he runs into Jorah at the pleasure house in Selhorys, and maybe another ep. or 2 in between, for a total of 5, 6 episodes in all.
Â 
At least, this is what I would do for storytelling purposes and TV time constraints.
3346	lostinwesteros	2014-05-05	Then there was that scene back in Quarth where the mysterious woman in the masque asked Jorah if he were going to betray Dany again, remember?  
Another thing that makes me wonder is that in the books, Dany found out about Barristan and Jorah at the same time, then made them wade through the sewers to get into Meereen.  But Dany knew about Barristan 'way back after he killed the Mantacore and Greyworm went through the sewers in Meereen.  Makes me worry Jorah won't be 'banished' after all, and I'm really looking forward to his and Tyrion's storyline.
3347	Onna Lewyys	2014-05-05	He needs to be banished. There are way too many people in Dany's entourage right now; it's important for her to be floundering next season without his advice; and Tyrion will need someone to travel with.
If Jorah is still reporting on Dany, it has to be because he thinks it's in her best interest (like he knows that Varys actually supports her). Then one of Dany's other men (likely Barristan) will somehow intercept one of his reports and tell Dany; Jorah will be unable to convince her that it's not a betrayal, and she'll banish him.

Â 
Â 
Unless Jorah messes with one of her babies. Â He continues to warn Dany about the dangers of her dragons, so I can't help but think Drogon has something to do with his banishment.
3349	AZAXD	2014-05-05	What if they played up the Barristan-Jorah antagonistic relationship? There is groundwork for it from S3, even though they haven't really touched on it this season.
Or maybe the Daario-Jorah thing. Was Jorah the one to bring up Joff's death? Maybe Daario could ask him how he knew, or something.
I'm convinced it'll happen. It's such beautiful poetic justice that the slaver becomes a slave. And also, Tyrion needs a sidekick!



That could be the way to do it.
Â 
I could see the two arguing over tactics with Dany then getting a bit too personal and calling each other out on stuff until Barristan brings out the big guns.
Also, I'm glad Jorah's stuck around so far but I hope there's enough time where he's gone to make meeting up with Tyrion all the more exciting. Unsullied fans will definitely recognize him instantly - especially considering it would only be what like 10-15 (very rough guess) episodes without him?Â 
God speed GRRM!!
3350	Misnthropia	2014-05-05	If Jorah is going to be banished, it could be possibly due to him taking the initiative and chaining up the dragons, after the farmer brings his child's bones to Dany.
Â 
That scene with Jorah and Barriston from last season seemed to indicate that Barristan knew nothing about Jorah's previous spying.


Â 
I tend to agree. I dont think Barriston knows he was spying, but he was more eluding to his slave trading. The way he worded it, almost saying that public opinion of him would force him to the sideline.
Â 
The man Knighted at the Battle of Pyke, Jorah Mormont second man through the doors, a well known man like Jorah being caught selling slaves would be not common knowledge but certainly out there. Him spying on the other hand, I dont think that would be something Varys nor Camp Dany would want to be known and it would only be her inner circle who would be privy to his betrayl.
Â 
Could news of Dany settling in for the long haul possibly come from the Iron Bank? They would obviously have a vested interest in Slavers Bay. We see Team Dragonstone is due for a meeting some bank executives re:massiveloan and Tywin has been setting up some massive iron bank involvement. Would it be a stretch to say a representative from the bank comes knocking in KL and Tywin tries to delay paying the loan back by saying they are under threat from the Tarygaryen girl with Dragons and the banker informs him that she is setting up shop in Mereen, you have nothing to worry about, you dont need gold give us our money?
3351	Martini Sigil	2014-05-05	Maybe Dany will think to ask, "Oh BTW Jorah, how the hell do you know what's going on in Westeros?"
3352	CandleWisps	2014-05-05	Maybe Dany will think to ask, "Oh BTW Jorah, how the hell do you know what's going on in Westeros?"


Â 
Doubt it :/ Stuff like the death of a King and the crowning of a new one are common knowledge. That's also what confuses me by people saying Varys knows whats going on with Dany because Jorah is still informing on her.Â  Varys knows whats going on because the conquering of three major slave cities will be become common and fast spread knowledge. No, Jorah's "betrayal" has to come in another form
3353	DaveyJoe	2014-05-05	It's time for Jorah to go, he hasn't done anything this season. Â I loved his heartbreak face in Rains of Castamere but he's just been window dressing in season 4. Â I kind of wish the show would shit or get off the pot with Jorah, why hasn't he kissed her yet? Â Last night's episode was a great opportunity. Â I'm okay with them putting it off for a while, but they're not even using him while he's still around. Â Give us some more "with all my heart," "until my dying breath," "khaleesi" moments or get rid of him!

Do you guys not remember the Barristan/Joran scene last season where he kind of subtly tries to figure out how much Barristan knows? Â That was there for a REASON.Â totally.

3363	Petyr Patter	2014-05-06	Well, with Danaerys currently on a "I am awesome, don't mess with me" power trip, dismissing Jorah is going to be believable for almost any reason.Â  The original reason in the book would still resonate very well.Â  He sold information of her to Robert Baratheon, which led to an assassination attempt.Â  He put her and her unborn child in danger.Â 
Â 
All they need is some plausible way for this information to come back to life.Â  Perhaps Missandei finds the original pardon.Â  Perhaps one of the Meereenese aproach and says he or she informs to Varys, and is willing to be a double agent, and proves it by providing missives.Â  These missives make it clear that someone has kept informing on her, but the who could only be Jorah.
Â 
Regardless, I'm sure he's bound for banishment.Â

Unrelated but I'd still love to know how Jorah's slave-trading was discovered in the first place.Â  Bear Island seems distant enough for a Lord to get away with such things.

I agree it would make no sense for Jorah to still be communicating with Varys.

I found the Tyrion/Jorah interacting in ADWD disappointing.Â  I think Dinklage and Glen will do much better work with the material onscreen.

You have to remember that his contract will stipulate that he's available for certain dates.. whether he's needed or not. As long as he's paid for that time period, then that's all that matters. He's free to do whatever he wants outside of this timeframe.

A heavily compressed Tyrion journey to Meereen may not need Jorah and evenÂ if it does Jorah doesn't need to be banished yet.

GOT is a show that actually allows the actors a lot of freedom to work on multiple projects at the same time. Jerome Flynn has been starring in a second TV show, Ripper Street, for the past two years. Michael Huisman (Daario 2.0) is now also appearing in the show Orphan Black, and apparently still has a recurring role on Nashville. And Kit Harington, NCW, and Peter Dinklage have all done movies in their time away from shooting GOT.
3383	SlowLoras	2014-05-09	LOL.
It always makes me laugh that they have one of the most attractive men on the show to play one of the ugliest characters.


Â 
No kidding. In the books I was like, well, there's this grumpy hairy old dude and I can sort of get why Dany's not into him, but on the show it's harder to maintain the suspension of disbelief - I mean, Khaleesi sweetheart, why are you not getting your teeth into that sandy-blonde, sultry-voiced piece of fine, fine man-meat?

3388	Envie	2014-05-09	At this point, my most pressing concern with dear Ser Friendzone is whether or not he owns a spare set of clothes, because he's looking pretty grubby these days. Still would though.

I was wondering this same thing -- dude take a bath, shave yer face and put on a clean shirt ffs maybe Dany would find you more attractive! 
Â 
But seriously, he still looks grubby even though they've been in Meereen a bit now. He should be getting pampered and preened by all those freed slave girls!Â

Me neither. Hope not. As much as I adore Sandor, and I DO, his fate seems to lie elsewhere. I don't think he's dead though.Â
3393	NaarioDaharis	2014-05-04	So, we get the epic conclusion to the mysterious Locke storyline. "Who is he? What will he do?"
Â 
1. What is going to happen with Bran & co.?
Â 
2. Will Jon and Bran see each other?
Â 
3. What will happen to Jon at Craster's Keep?
Â 
Â Let's answer these quesions
Â 
1. Oh, nothing of any consequence. Bran wargs into Hodor and kills the bad guy and goes back to where he would have been if he had not been captured in the first place with no consequences.
Â 
2.Â Nope. A forced Choose Your Own Adventure decision via Jojen causes Bran to nonsensically choose to run away, again back to where they would have been if none of this had happened with no consequences.
Â 
3.Â Nothing. He kills all the bad guys, has a boss fight with Karl (Dirk), and none of the Wildling women want to go back to Castle Black with him. So, he's back to where he would have been if none of this had happened with no consequences.
Â 
This is filler.
Â 
I know, some of you thought it was entertaining because there was a fight scene with swords and fire and such.
Â 
What is your opinion on this sort of pointless plot taking up 20 minutes of an episode, material which makes no difference at all in the story line? Does it bother you? Do you just enjoy it?
Â 
Discuss
Â 
Â 
Â
3394	Fat Trell	2014-05-05	I agree. Worse than being filler, it was futile filler. It took a grand total of 2 episodes(about 40 minutes) to solve.
Â 
Locke was decent enough for a show only character. He also provided a tie to the south for the Wall. Something this plot sorely lacks pre-Stannis. Karl was similarly somewhat entertaining.Â 
Â 
Why not keep them around, see where their characters can effect the story? Why not have the mutineers join Mance at a pivotal time to help turn the battle? Why not have them simply sit tight in Craster's and fight the Others or interact with Stannis' army in some way? Why not keep Locke around to turn on Jon at some dramatic moment?
Â 
It seems like the show can't decide if it wants to veer away from the books or maintain the plot.Â  They add things only to drop them for a contrived or blatantly obvious reason later on to tie things back to the books.
Â 
Also: WTF are Craster's wives going to do? They have no arms, just burned their only shelter, and have likely never left the keep before. Where are they going to go? Why would they not simply stay at the only place they've ever known? Or at least take the nice guy who just saved your lives up on his offer to take you to a warmer place with no ice zombies? How will they survive in the permanently frozen wasteland that is the show's Beyond the Wall? Is there any explanation even possible for what their next move is? They don't seem to want to go to Mance(who they have no way of finding besides) given they want to "make their own way."
Â 
This is such a blatant "we don't want to solve this problem we wrote ourselves into" move.
3395	JonDunn	2014-05-05	Most show only viewers now think Jon is a badass and actually.....LIKE him?
Â 
Â 
Job well done.Â
3396	Justin Danford	2014-05-05	My thoughts exactly. I'm not a book purist, I do however weigh the value of changes by their ability to advance or enrich the plot. The only thing solved in the crasters arc were the problems created by... The crasters plot. 
Why waste 30 precious minutes (maybe more) in a time-crunched series on inventing a plot line that deviated from the source book, jeopardized the integrity of a characters decision in a future book, and spoiled a yet unreleased book? Did they really hate CH that much. Here's an idea, gang, save valuable valuable minutes of screen time by introducing a wildly interesting and mysterious character who just so happens to close the men at crasters problem during his evening stroll. That should give some more time for KoTLT backstory, rhaeghar backstory, or just...more story 
It's as if the showrunners heard someone mention Cold Hands and said "Cold hands? Uh what Hands? Wait what's that ver there... Look! Swords! A giant! Firrrrre!!!" 
Great. Cold Hands cut and the entirety of Jon's raiding party/crasters wives all proven to be idiots in one fell swoop. Who satnds around watching the biggest fire the North has ever seen, when there are literally two arimies roaming around those woods? 
Can't light a fire in the daytime to burn a corpse in S2 cause Mance's scouts might see....Burns entire homestead at night and stands there watching in S4.

Why does Jon need heroic moments? He is about to fight off a Wildling attack from the South, and then hold the Wall in badass fashion while leading his decimated brothers against impossible odds.
3398	Volverin	2014-05-05	You're asking why? The answer is simple. If they wouldn't have done it then Jon, Bran and the rest would have absolutely no screen time for almost the entire season, they didn't want to rush the story too much so they invented those scenes, simple.
Â 
And they weren't bad scenes.

Â 
This. Filler is filler - so they made it the best possible filler they could without ruining the integrity of the overall story for Jon or Bran either one.
Â 
Yes it's true the show is on a time crunch to get everything in with just 10 hours of footage - but what else would they have shown for Bran - a whole lot of shivering in the cold and starving along the way? Some would argue that Coldhands could have been the true filler and probably should have been. For whatever reason they decided to drop coldhands in favor of good action packed drama with a big heart wrenching decision on Bran's part NOT to go to Jon Snow ... that's good television drama.
Â 
But I enjoyed the OP's summary. Spot on assessment and yes, it was total eye candy filler. It was good filler though.
3401	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	They could have used the time to show what the hell is going on with the Ironborn and what Roose is doing.
3402	Metopheles	2014-05-05	yap. horrible plot. And all these damn holes in it. Jon finds Bran isn't there..oh well, I don't care. Let's head home.
Â 
Why did Locke join the NW in the first place? He could never have returned from it.
How did he plan to get Bran to the Boltons, as he obviously did not intend to kill him, cause he could have done it without freeing him.
Â 
That was just bad. And as stated perfectly in the OP : A filler. an hour of an filler. And did not do anything to the plot.
Â 
Yeehaw, for extending a third of the book into 10 hours.
3403	Justin Danford	2014-05-05	Seems to me like the perfect season to start sewing some R+L backstory. Oberyn is in town and has already mentioned the Rhaegars infidelity. Working that angle (having him keep finding ways to mention it when various characters offer to strike a deal, ex: "Elia had a promise from Rhaegar and look how turned out...") would allow for some really interesting fleshing out of something that tv show really hasn't done: historic scaffolding of Martins world. 
Disrguntled Oberyn: Bran hears Knight of the laughing tree (while walking through some white walker wilding-body spin art), dany name dropping her brother his mistakes or legacy, etc....
There are many ways to make "boring" live action not boring by imbuing it with dramatic significance. And then if you really felt some spice was needed....BOOM Coldhands lays out the mutineers right as bran is captured, seems like a nice compromise

There's bad filler and then there's good filler. Bad filler = WHERE ARE MY DRAAAAAAAAAGONS!!! Good fillder = this.
Â 
Most viewers think Bran's story is boring - we can't have him literally keep walking to the tree for three seasons. This gives Bran and the gang something to do. Stannis basically sat on his arse last season and it sucked, they're going to learn from that and give Bran something to do.
Â 
Also the show due to budget constraints, is probably only going to merge the two battles for The Wall and Castle Black into one and keep it as the big battle moment of this season, That's fair enough, but they have to give Jon something to do otherwise he'll just be sitting around waiting for Stannis to show up and have the battle.
Â 
It was a good story, we got some real tension, good character moments, great action sequences, and some cool characters like Karl and Locke. Also it cleans up the question of "what happened to the Mutineers?".
3405	Adhara	2014-05-05	To a show only viewer, it's just, compelling.
Small-Pholk don't notice filler in their meat loaf
we just enjoy the yummy goodness.
Â 
Filler, is the ten months of life I live while waiting for the next friggin' season!
3406	Hippocras	2014-05-05	I think the critics pile on without trying to understand why certain moves are made.
Contrary to what was said in the OP, this served several purposes.
1. It established Jon's growing role as a leader and a fighter. This is an important thread to develop because of the vote that will happen this season, and they don't intend to show TWO battles at the Wall as happened it the books: that would not work for the show. There will be a single battle for the Wall, so Jon's leadership role needed to be established another way.
2. It reaffirmed that Jon has a certain level of respect for the opinions of both women and wildlings. He asked the women what they wanted and let them do what they would.
3. Craster's Keep is slowly setting up the role of the woman who is clearly the leader of Craster's wives. I suspect she will end up being the Woods Witch who leads the Wildlings to Hardhome. This is likely an important factor in Winds of Winter and needs to be established somehow. Watch the scenes involving that woman, and then remember Hardhome.
4. It showed for the first time what Hodor is capable of when Bran wargs him, and also how confusing and upsetting it is for Hodor when he is warged. This will also be important.
5. It allowed Bran to stay part of the story without simply showing him in endless boring scenes traveling North.
6. It gave Jon a means to reunite with Ghost.

3407	roxWolfox	2014-05-05	I didn't find anything about Craster's Keep 'entertaining', ever.Â  Not in the books, and especially not when watching the show.Â  And now that the whole Craster/Black Brother rogues abuse storyline is done, I feel satisfied in how it was handled.Â  One time where there is a rather 'happy' ending.
The women at the end of the show became more heroic to me than anyone else in the series up to this point.Â  They had been beaten and raped for most of their lives, 'walking on eggshells' so to speak, without having choice or input in any part of their existence.Â  For the first time in their lives they are given a chance to decide their own fate.Â  It spoke volumes to me.Â  They'd rather face the White Walkers and whatever other monsters there were out there having made the choice to do so, than allowing another man (boy or no) decide what was going to keep them 'safe'.Â 
Bran taking over Hodor, then Hodor seeing blood on his hands was another powerful moment.Â  There are some lines that you don't cross, yet Bran did.Â  It saved his life, but now Hodor is aware of a violation.Â  Another profound moment.
I found this episode to be very subtle in its suggestions, but powerful nonetheless.
3408	Justin Danford	2014-05-05	When there are literally thousands of pages of source material to draw from (and now presumably the thousand or so WOW pages that could fall into the show at any moment) to even be discussing a plot line that spans over multiple episodes as filler, is a failure on the writers part, in my opinion.
They can add filler and do it well (which they have as far as entertainment value goes) but that is entirely separate from whether or not it was good for the overall story. All signs point to no on that front.
3409	hollowcrown	2014-05-05	3. Craster's Keep is slowly setting up the role of the woman who is clearly the leader of Craster's wives.

Yeah I thought she would be developed into the Hardhome character - independent wildling woman wanting to chose her own fate etc.

Â 
I will agree I did like the way it ended for the women of Craster's keep. They're finally 'free' of the oppression and isolation and abuse they suffered there.Â 
Â 
I don't think they have a whole lot to worry about heading off on their own other than surviving the cold and possible starvation. I don't think the White Walkers are going to mess with them considering these are their Mothers / Sisters - right?
3411	Justin Danford	2014-05-05	Though I guess we should all be glad Jojens vision didn't include Jon Snow Weilding Lightbringer against the darkness.

That was my thought when the woman said they'd go their own way.Â  The White Walkers may know their kin (mothers, sisters), or the women may still be protected because of Craster's sacrificing his sons.Â  Either way, it was great seeing them unafraid for the first time since they were introduced to the series.Â

She was also the same woman, if you remember, who persuaded Sam to take Gilly and the baby with him last season. I don't know if Little Monster will have any future role, but some speculate he might because his brothers might come for him at the wall. If so, this could have been a deliberate move by the Woods Witch.

Oh true - hopefully we'll see her again, she's a pretty memorable character and a good actress.
3417	bubbletubs	2014-05-05	I for one really enjoyed the episode. It was like finishing a good questline in a game. I liked that they pushed forward Sansa story, the way they revealed how much of hand in the many plots littlefinger had during his reunion with Lysa. I'm curious as to where hound is heading without being injured, they certainly developed on character relationships. Even if you consider it a filler it was more time spent in the well crafted GoT universe onscreen.

Â 
Sure, while it did not serve too much of a bigger purpose, the Craster scene was, in my opinion, one of the best sequences the show has ever done... Especially the scene with Jojen's vision and then his talk with Bran (Thomas Brodie Sangster for episode MVP). That scene is now probably my favourite sequence in the entire show. What happened to Bran in this episode was definitely more interesting than anything that has happened to him in the books It made me care a lot more for him, Jojen, Meera as well as Jon and Grenn. I, for one thought it was a great sequence.

How dare you bring rationality into this.
3420	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-05	It was filler, but it wasn't bad filler. Jon doesn't do almost anything important before the end of the season the same goes for Bran. Karl was entertaining as was Locke, and for Jon it worked very well on his path to leadership.Â
3421	AnotherCrannogman	2014-05-05	And both dire wolves are present and their owners are threatened and they do not show up. They do nothing? What? Nothing?  Did the CGI cost too much?
3422	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-05	By the time Bran set Ghost and Summer free the fighting was done. The only mutineer left was Rast and you saw what happened to him.
3423	north of the wall	2014-05-05	There are things in the books I'd rather see and I was really worried about the Jon meeting Bran aspect of this deviation. But all in all it was my fav episode this season. Jon finally looks like a badass and I'm happy for that. The Bran/Jon thing isn't really ruined and I really liked other storylines in this ep so all in all I didnt mind too much.
Filler yes... but entertaining filler it was
3424	Carl Rhaego	2014-05-05	It was interesting, entertaining filler for me. Not boring filler like Qarth or half the scenes in King's Landing last season. And I enjoyed not knowing what happens as a book reader for once.
3425	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-05	Just because a scene doesn't forcibly drive a plot forward, doesn't mean it lacks any substance or character development. Look at Breaking Bad's episode Fly, or Deadwood's amateur night in Season 3. They're not vital, and could be removed without directly affecting the main plot; but then the audience misses out on something that gives a bit of insight into the broader picture and characters involved.
Â 
At Craster's we see Jon beginning to undertake his role as a leader, his kindness and respect to the wives and their decision to live free, the implications of Bran's warging, the importance of why he needs to keep going North, Jojen's visions, Jon reuniting with Ghost, and Jeor Mormont avenged.
Â 
Considering this is the halfway point of Season 4, I really don't see the harm in scenes like this; especially when it gives Bran a bit more urgency to head North, as opposed to just plodding along like in the books.
3426	AndrA©s Garcia	2014-05-05	ASOIAF fans complaining about filler makes me laugh.
Â 
You guys have read AFFC and ADWD, right?
3427	Lord_Dustin	2014-05-05	I agree with the points that Hippocras made on the previous page.
Â 
This season has to establish Jon as a leader and a character that the audience really wants to root for. Â As much as I dislike Jon as a character, I think he has been let down throughout the adaptation process (and possible due to filming location). Â He was a non-entity in Season 2, which is when he really should have been given the opportunity to develop under the Halfhand's mentorship.
Â 
Liberating Craster's Keep is Jon's 'dracarys' moment, both as a character and in the eyes of the Unsullied. Â I think that D & D did an excellent job with the new material.
Â 
We also learnt a great deal more about Jojen Reed - which is always a plus.
3428	Jinjonator	2014-05-05	Considering Jon and Bran don't actually have enough material in the books to properly carry them through the season, there was literally no choice but to make things up in order to give them something to do before the end of the season. I haven't heard any suggestions from people saying this plotline shouldn't have been included about what invented material would've been preferable (because, again, inventing new material was the only option, unless you literally believe that having both characters do absolutely nothing until the end is somehow better).

"Hey ladies I just saved, have you seen a crippled boy and a Hodor?"
3430	SlowLoras	2014-05-05	I think the critics pile on without trying to understand why certain moves are made.
Contrary to what was said in the OP, this served several purposes.
1. It established Jon's growing role as a leader and a fighter. This is an important thread to develop because of the vote that will happen this season, and they don't intend to show TWO battles at the Wall as happened it the books: that would not work for the show. There will be a single battle for the Wall, so Jon's leadership role needed to be established another way.
2. It reaffirmed that Jon has a certain level of respect for the opinions of both women and wildlings. He asked the women what they wanted and let them do what they would.
3. Craster's Keep is slowly setting up the role of the woman who is clearly the leader of Craster's wives. I suspect she will end up being the Woods Witch who leads the Wildlings to Hardhome. This is likely an important factor in Winds of Winter and needs to be established somehow. Watch the scenes involving that woman, and then remember Hardhome.
4. It showed for the first time what Hodor is capable of when Bran wargs him, and also how confusing and upsetting it is for Hodor when he is warged. This will also be important.
5. It allowed Bran to stay part of the story without simply showing him in endless boring scenes traveling North.
6. It gave Jon a means to reunite with Ghost.


Â 
All of this. In the books, these points are all brought up via long chapters in which not much actually happens (in Bran's case) or via early Wildling skirmishes which aren't going to happen (in Jon's) - bringing the storylines together and exploring all of these plot points makes sense given the time constraints of the TV show. If you're going to have filler, at least make it interesting to watch - I'd rather see swordfighting and Ghost and Craster's wives taking control of their own lives and the questionable moral and ethical decisions surrounding Bran warging Hodor than, say, "WHERE ARE MY DRAGONS??"
Â 
Us Sullied need to accept that the show is a different entity, exploring plot points in a different way because it has to. They can't spare hours of footage of Bran in the snow testing out his warging skills and chatting endlessly with Jojen about the three-eyed crow - this segment was effective in that we got how effective and dramatic Bran warging Hodor can be, and how important it is for Bran to continue his mission, foregoing a reunion with his brother. For Jon, we got a short sharp lesson in how strong a leader he could potentially be, but also how fair - he considers the Wildling women people, which is also establishing his burgeoning kinship with the Wildlings and how this will be used against him in the future.
Â 
Yes, it was filler. But it was filler which actually accomplished things in terms of key character points and foreshadowing future events. Plus, it was entertaining to watch.
3431	The hairy bear	2014-05-05	I hate the term "filler". The notion that every single moment and scene has to drive the plot forward is nonsense.Â  We need to devote time to character development, to put things in perspective, to ponder into the current situation, ... A good story is based on having the right balance between "plot advacement" and "plot sandstill", and if you don't have the later, it suffers.
3432	Lord Damian	2014-05-05	Yes, it was a filler because Bran was essentually forgotten for 2 novels. I wonder if we will get an Osha/Rickon/Shaggy scene this year, probably the last episode.
3433	Duckface	2014-05-05	Yes, yes, I totally see how making new scenes at Craster's with all Hollywood stereotypes is a good thing that developes characters. Seriously, a villain, who doesn't rape&murder but just talks until Night's Watch arrives. Then another villain instead of killing Bran takes him somewhere and gets killed. Such a strong character Jon has become by killing some scum and Bran by warging Hodor. Now we know that he can warg into Hodor, totally haven't seen it in S3.

3434	Lann Casterly	2014-05-05	I actually thought that Bran having to choose while looking at his brother for the first time in years made it all the more powerful. Â I felt bad for both Hodor and Bran after killing Locke. Â Not that it didn't have to be done, but it was pretty heavy. Â I would expect Craster's wives to end up with the Free Folk Mance is gathering, and I imagine the one in the scene with Jon at the end will be showing back up again.
3435	SoManyVows	2014-05-05	Can someone tell me why Lcke wouldn't just slit their throats when they were all tied up? Seemed a bit cartoon villainish... "I'm here to kill you, but first I must delay and take you over here by which you may devise a way to thwart me."


Â 
Two very simple explanations:
Â 
1) Roose Bolton ordered Locke to hunt down both Stark boys. That means Bran AND Rickon. Locke was successfully able to track down Bran, but once he saw that Rickon wasn't with him, he had two options - blindly traverse the entire goddamn expanse of the North looking for one kid, or torture that information out of Bran. Forcing Bran to give up his brother was going to take time - time that Locke didn't have during the attack. Much easier for him to carry Bran a safe distance away from the Keep so that he could interrogate him without risking discovery.
Â 
2) In order to grant Locke his reward of "a thousand acres and a holdfast", a practical man like Roose Bolton would probably require proof of death. That could mean Bran's body, his head, or some other token. The entire reason that Locke was sent to find Bran and Rickon in the first place is that Theon let them slip through his fingers, then let Dagmer kill two random orphans, burn their bodies, and pass them off as the Stark boys. Roose isn't going to fall for the same trick twice. Had Locke failed to track down Bran and Rickon, it would be all too easy for him to show up at the Dreadfort and say "Yeah, of course I killed them! Give me my reward now!" Then the Stark boys turn up alive later, and the Boltons have a new crisis to deal with.
Â 
I grant you that they could have done a better job explaining Locke's motivations onscreen. But I think that his logic was sound based on what he knew at the time. Obviously, he wasn't counting on Bran being able to warg into Hodor and snap his neck.

  Thank you for this. "Filler" is such a freaking obnoxious term. It just reeks of entitlement. More than perhaps any other series in the history of television, Game of Thrones has spoiled its viewers when it comes to what we should expect in terms of plot twists and general exhilaration on a week-to-week basis. Every television series in the history of the medium has devoted a significant portion of the episodes comprising the middle section of its season towards setting up future developments and developing its characters. This is to be expected, and yet when it comes to Game of Thrones, people are all too eager to label that natural development with that dreaded, entirely-too-lazy label, â<U+0080><U+009C>fillerâ<U+0080><U+009D>. In tonightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s episode, we got numerous significant developments and entertaining scenes ... including Craster's keep, for the reasons that many others have already stated. Yet the consensus people are leaping to Oh, it was all filler! Nothing really happened! Why did they change it from the book ... where even less happens?
Â 
Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s some utter nonsense.Â  I watched Mad Men immediately following Game of Thrones and was treated to a rich hour wherein, plot-wise, â<U+0080><U+009C>nothing happenedâ<U+0080><U+009D>.Â  Except, you know, character development. Tonightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s episode of Game of Thrones featured that in spades, plus a significant amount of kick-ass action sequences. And people still arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t happy. That speaks to what a high bar that this show has set.

3436	Starksmustwin	2014-05-05	You're asking why? The answer is simple. If they wouldn't have done it then Jon, Bran and the rest would have absolutely no screen time for almost the entire season, they didn't want to rush the story too much so they invented those scenes, simple.
Â 
And they weren't bad scenes.


Â 
Â 
Agreed. Â They gave Jon and Bran something to do that didn't alter anything else that's going to happen down the line. Â  very well done and very enjoyable as well.
3437	Widow's B Wailin'	2014-05-05	In regards to Locke I feel like there was no way they could have let him go free after his attempt to kidnap Bran however, I think I would have liked to see him escape and somehow make it back to Roose unsuccessful. Locke then explains that because of unforseen and uncontrollable circumstances (maybe white walkers, dire wolves, too many men to fight) that he was unable to capture Bran but knows where he's headed. Roose seems understanding but now Locke is officially a deserter of the Night's Watch and uses this pretense to get rid of him either executing him or giving him to Ramsey to play with. It'll just show another side to Roose's coldness that he would kill his own men but w/e.
It was a very typical turn out I mean I knew Bran would escape and continue north, I knew Jon & Co. would save the day and the direwolves would be freed (please explain to me how you shove a direwolf into a cage anyway?) and I was almost certain there would be no Stark Bros. reunion but I thought D&D would've found more a of clever way to do it. Suffice to say I was very unsatisfied. It was actually more satisfying seeing them get into this predicament then out of it. Jojen totally saved this sequence w/all his foreshadowing. 
When is the little back door raid going to happen where Jon finds Ygritte sprawled out across the snow and she says to him "We should've stayed in that cave" and her final "You know nothing" I figure they're going to hang on to Rose Leslie for as long as possible but she has to die. 
I assume that Jon won't be imprisoned? And I also assume, considering the big battle is Ep.9, that they're going to treat the vote like it's NBD and Jon will pretty much win by default based on his courage, bravery, and leadership skills he showed during the battle and the moments leading up to it. I bet it'll be over in 123 w/o any doubts that Jon could lose.

The problem here is... Why did Locke let the other hostages live? I mean they could have told Jon everything and he would be fucked. I understand your reasoning and I thought taking Bran made sense, but no attempt whatsoever to cover his tracks? That's just weird.

I never felt when reading like Jon could lose. His entire storyline has been pretty well telegraphed from the beginning. The only thing that surprised me was the, you know.Â
3446	The King Of Cooked Steak	2014-05-05	They had to filler it up. If they didn't, they'd finish Bran's story in 3 episodes at most. And if they did have something of importance happen to these characters, they would stray too far from the books. It was pretty much a lose-lose situation, so they went with the one they wouldn't lose much with. TBH the "boss-fight" between Jon and Karl was very predictable and I didn't care much for it.
Â 
In general, the episode was good. It was a filler episode, but seriously, aren't GRRM's recent books mostly filler too? They're obviously gonna' prepare the battle at Castle Black in a few episodes and the meeting with BR is gonna' happen at episode 7 or 8.
3447	GHOSTSTARK	2014-05-05	thought it was alright. they needed to spice Brans story up a bit and make it more obvious that Jon is becoming more of a leader in the NW. was pretty cool how Karl almost got Jon but on of the Wives slowed him in time for Jon to get his Mormont justice.
3448	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-05	Perhaps Jaime never named Locke?
Maybe he told Tywin that he was captured by a gang of men beaten and then one of them did the deed - citing that he would never recognise the man again?

A good story is based on having the right balance between "plot advacement" and "plot sandstill", and if you don't have the later, it suffers.


Â 
Agree. Again, I wonder if some call this filler only because it was not in the books. This is not filler, since it shows many traits of each character, not to mention that it advances Bran's plot in the show. If it were in the books, then people would consider it to be an important scene. Personally, I find it much more interesting to have these larger deviations. Of course, they have to be good deviations, which may not always be the case.

3451	Korgan	2014-05-05	Those Craster' scenes was good for the show and a way to come back too the book's original plot that DD was messing really bad.
3452	RhaenysBalerion	2014-05-05	I won't be popular with this, but the Craster's scenes were well made, had a point and added something to the show (contrary to many other filler scenes).Â 
Â 
1. Currently, the show is lacking villains. With Joffrey dead, there aren't really any more Lannisters to hate with Jaime maimed and Cersei so over-humanized and Charles Dance/Tywin being awesome. There's Ramsay, but we haven't seen Ramsay for episodes plus the Theon torture was the villain lead of the previous season, they can't play that card again for an entire episode. There are the Thenns, but one little scene about big bad guys attacking a village won't make you start hate the wildlings with Jon being best pals with them last season and even making out with Ygritte. But the audience needs somebody to hate. It's one thing to follow the Everybody's Gray guide line in a book and an entirely different on a tv show. And so, to be it seems absolutely logical and well based to make the Craster's black brothers the temporary bad guys.Â 
Â 
2. Rooting them out is essential to building up Jon's future NW career as well.Â 
Â 
3. Much more interesting for Wall scenes than listening to Sam raving about Gilly's safety while they are waiting for Mance Rayder's army.Â 
Â 
4. This is Game of Thrones, it needs its regular brutality dose.Â 
Â 
Capturing Bran worked out, I think. It finally brought that frustrating desperation and tragedy of "almost there" feeling to the audience the book constantly uses but the show hasn't show too much of yet. It was nicely done. It was very nice that Bran and Jon were so close but there was still no reunion. Harassing Meera... that was pretty much just a filler, but I guess it was enough of harassing random Craster daughters and they tried to go for someone the audience cares more about (and probably failed, because I doubt anybody likes the Reeds as characters).Â 
Â 
Locke whole departed secret agent story line was nicely written, added some long missed spice and they actor did pretty well too, I think. His death: Hodor got some action, Bran showed a bit of a badass side. I liked it.Â 
Â 
The battle could have been just a little bit better. But no complaints. It was still okay. Karl vs Jon. Kinda lame that Karl basically beat Jon in single combat, but it was expected that the girl would kill him (or have a part in it) since the camera focused on her too many times last time to remain insignificant. Plus, it left me with a sensation of justice. It came across as sort of a Pia story north of the Wall.Â 
Â 
And biggest advantage of the whole Craster's story line: something HAPPENED. You could be excited about something, root for the death of Karl and co, not just watch people talking and talking and talking and talking.Â

They weren't messing it up- they knew exactly what they were doing. I'm really happy with the way it turned out  The last few minutes had a feel good vibe going on, something that is extremely rare in Game of Thrones.
3454	I'll pay the iron price	2014-05-05	Jon (as good as he is) not being able to defeat Karl one on one showed just why Rast and the others were so afraid of him (Karl).
3455	boojam	2014-05-05	And both dire wolves are present and their owners are threatened and they do not show up. They do nothing? What? Nothing? Did the CGI cost too much?Yeah I expected both Summer and Ghost to get into the melee , and where the heck was Summer?
3456	Rockroi	2014-05-05	Responding to the argument that the scenes last night served some-sort of purpose:Â 
Â 
BUt before I begin I just want to ask people if they like Clam Chowder? Â What do you like about it. Â For me- call me silly- but I like the actual clams, and not the filler of the potatoes. Â 
Â 
Keep that in mind. Â 
Â 

Contrary to what was said in the OP, this served several purposes.
Â 
1. It established Jon's growing role as a leader and a fighter. This is an important thread to develop because of the vote that will happen this season, and they don't intend to show TWO battles at the Wall as happened it the books: that would not work for the show. There will be a single battle for the Wall, so Jon's leadership role needed to be established another way.
Â 

Â 
You can do all of this without including Bran.Â  Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s attack on Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s â<U+0080><U+0093> while certainly having the odor of contrivance â<U+0080><U+0093> can be explained by saying that if those men get captured they may reveal the NW true strength and they are deserters.Â  So, using it as a â<U+0080><U+009C>character builderâ<U+0080><U+009D> for Jon works, but no need to include the time-sync that is Bran.Â 
Â 
2. It reaffirmed that Jon has a certain level of respect for the opinions of both women and wildlings. He asked the women what they wanted and let them do what they would.
Â 

Â 
We already knew all that- if being tethered to Ygritte etc for an entire season didn't convince you that he respects wildings and women, nothing will.Â  We donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need it to be reinforced because we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have the time.Â  Further, you could have accomplished all this by having a scene between Jon and Gilly at the Wall; 5 minutes- done. No need to waste two episodes. Â 
Â 
3. Craster's Keep is slowly setting up the role of the woman who is clearly the leader of Craster's wives. I suspect she will end up being the Woods Witch who leads the Wildlings to Hardhome. This is likely an important factor in Winds of Winter and needs to be established somehow. Watch the scenes involving that woman, and then remember Hardhome.
Â 

Â 
Donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care.Â  The fact that they are laying back-story to a 4th-level character does not interest me.Â  Hereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s an idea â<U+0080><U+0093> why not lay the back-story of the PRIMARY characters instead?!Â  You know like Ned and Jaime and Tyrion- characters we actually NEED to know something about and not a character whoâ<U+0080>¦ is actually not a character.Â  The show does not have the luxury of that kind of time.Â 
Â 
Which is why I have a problem with it and why the OP is correct- it was filler.Â  Like eatingÂ  clam chowder- you can tell if its good or not after the first bite; if you taste mostly potatoes â<U+0080><U+0093> the filler- you know you are eating cheap stuff.Â  But get mostly clams? That's what you paid for! Â 
Â 
I paid for Tyrion; for Brienne; Dany, Jaime, Tywin, Stannis, Arya, Sansa, Jon (they made me do it) and not the "woman-who-we-sort-of-heard-about-for-like-4-total-paragraphs-in-book-five." Â I can do without that; THAT is the potatoes. Â The fact that there is a REASON for potatoes or the fact that some people may like potatoes does not change the fact that its filler. I paid for the clams, thanks. Â 
Â 
Â 
4. It showed for the first time what Hodor is capable of when Bran wargs him, and also how confusing and upsetting it is for Hodor when he is warged. This will also be important.
Â 

Â 
Again, you could have done that in an independent scene, with Bran making Hodor do something and Hodor not liking it; it could even have been killing somebody.Â  You donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need to send Bran on a magical collision-course with Jon Snow in the â<U+0080><U+009C>Magnetic-Zoneâ<U+0080><U+009D> that is CRasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Keep that just attracts every major character in the books.Â  Fuck, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m surprised we didn't find Stannis and Khal Drogo up there.Â 
Â 
5. It allowed Bran to stay part of the story without simply showing him in endless boring scenes traveling North
Â 

.
Â 
I got bad news for you: Branâ<U+0080><U+0099>s story IS an endlessly boring travel up North.Â  Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what that is.Â  You send somebody up North donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t expect that to be a â<U+0080><U+009C>page-turner.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â  And even if its boring, its better than Gerrymandering a system where two characters can kinda-sorta-but-not-really connect.Â  Another bait-and-switch.Â  We donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need that.
Â 
What we need is well developed story-arcs tethered to the foundation of the underlying narrative; not silly sidetracks and â<U+0080>¦ potatoes.Â 
Â 
6. It gave Jon a means to reunite with Ghost.
Â 

Â 
Again, have Ghost show up at the Wall like it was in the books.Â  I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know anyone who was sitting on the edge of their seats trying to figure out the complexities of â<U+0080>¦. Of â<U+0080>¦ having a wolfâ<U+0080>¦ goâ<U+0080>¦ South.Â  Wow.Â  You donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need an ultra-silly and convoluted set-up just to get Ghost back with Jon.Â  Andâ<U+0080>¦ why was Ghost there to begin with?Â  Oh, thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s right- potatoes.Â 
Â 
Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s all that was; an excuse to have the show serve us potatoes and hope we forget about the clams.Â 
Â 
Filler.Â  Convoluted, empty, unfulfilling and contrived. Â
3457	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-05	Blah blah blah. Get over it. They were good scenes.
3458	aFeastForDragons	2014-05-05	Jon (as good as he is) not being able to defeat Karl one on one showed just why Rast and the others were so afraid of him (Karl).


Â 
Yep. It showed that for all his training with Winterfell's master of arms he still wasn't a match for an experienced street fighter. If Jon wants to win he will have to stop being so honourable. Â Nice little bit of forshadowing there.
3459	Arkash	2014-05-05	Okay, as much as I would have love Locke to stay around, it didnt seem filer to me : the main point of it all was to show Jon as a competent leader and it worked !
3460	1000AcresAndAHoldfast	2014-05-05	it will happen a lot more, the narrative from the books gets even more disjointed in a feast for crows so they are going to need a lot of filler if they want to keep bran in the picture, tbh i dont really know why they have to, I wouldnt mind if Bran disappeared for a few episodes, i dont really rate the lad as an actor at all. Anyone who has read the books will know that by the end of ADWD he has only just reached the three-eyed crow and had his early initiations, but it looks like that will have happened by the end of this season.Â
3461	Bayard	2014-05-05	At Craster's we see Jon beginning to undertake his role as a leader, his kindness and respect to the wives and their decision to live free, the implications of Bran's warging, the importance of why he needs to keep going North, Jojen's visions, Jon reuniting with Ghost, and Jeor Mormont avenged.


Â 
I'm sorry but I can't agree, what exactly did they show us? Jon, losing half of his men in his first role as a leader of the Night's Watch. In any battle, in any time in history, that would be considered a huge defeat. He had the element of surprise, he was fighting men completely unprepared, drunk and yet what does he do? he attacks screaming like a mad man . Sure, that could have been a good decision, panic could work for them, help them win the fight... but it didn't. Even more so, they had that badly coreographed battle inside with Jon losing badly to some King's Lander trained on the streets with some knives. They've put this idea forward many times, especially with Bronn, that honor kills you, and so on. Right, as if the master of arms doesn't prepare young lords for that, for facing commoners on a battle field. Anyway rant over.
Â 
Rockroi, did I ever tell you how much I love your opinions? )
3462	HMR	2014-05-05	Woah, woah, hold your horses. A dude got stabbed through the mouth. Nuff said.
3463	Winterfell's Revenge	2014-05-05	Can someone tell me why Lcke wouldn't just slit their throats when they were all tied up? Seemed a bit cartoon villainish... "I'm here to kill you, but first I must delay and take you over here by which you may devise a way to thwart me."


Â 
Â 
I assumed that since he found the boys separated, he thought he needed to keep Bran alive long enough to find out where Rickon was as well. That's all I could come up with. *shrugs*
3464	boojam	2014-05-05	Responding to the argument that the scenes last night served some-sort of purpose:Â Â BUt before I begin I just want to ask people if they like Clam Chowder?

That was really bad, I thought for a second I was watching a slasher flick.
3466	Hippocras	2014-05-05	@Rockroi,
So....basically your argument is that the information that was communicated in this sequence should have been split up into several different scenes. This means you simply fail yo acknowledge the severe constraints, particularly in terms of of run-time, that the show has. They NEED to compress things together and communicate as much development as possible in as few scenes as possible. Your argument requires adding another 3 episodes just to accommodate the scenes you think should have happened instead. 
The time it would take to show a preliminary wildling attack on the wall for the same purpose of establishing Jon as a battle commander would have been about the same, but would not have advanced Bran's story or the Hardhome story simultaneously.
As for Hardhome and the Woods Witch.....seriously? You don't care? That's your argument? You do realize that the events at Hardhome are quite a big deal in Jon's future story right? Probably in Bran's story as well.
3467	Tquinn BC	2014-05-05	What we got:
Â 
1. Time for Jon to become a leader in the eyes of the Watch
2. Filler, yes Filler for Bran. I'm not going to watch Bran march around in the snow for a season. This was just fine.
3. Another close Stark reunion, but failure at the end
4. Jojen prophecy
5. Solid acting from scary as fuck Karl
Â 
Wasn't that bad of a change. Films and books are different.Â
3468	igrewupinKL	2014-05-05	The women at the end of the show became more heroic to me than anyone else in the series up to this point.Â  They had been beaten and raped for most of their lives, 'walking on eggshells' so to speak, without having choice or input in any part of their existence.Â  For the first time in their lives they are given a chance to decide their own fate.Â  It spoke volumes to me.Â  They'd rather face the White Walkers and whatever other monsters there were out there having made the choice to do so, than allowing another man (boy or no) decide what was going to keep them 'safe'.Â 


Â 
Nicely put. I appreciated this as well
Â 
To op, I actually liked the 'filler' it created suspense and heartbreak for the fact that bran will never see jon again. it reunited jon with ghost and provided a reason for his absence..
and also created an opportunity to have insight into jojen's seer abilities.Â 
plus we got carl tanner from gin alley, and what happens to crasters sons
so overall, not pointless

Â 
Rockroi, did I ever tell you how much I love your opinions? )


Â 
This.
Â 
OK, so I'm not the only one who thinks that Jon's fight scenes are really clunky and fake looking?
Â 
Â 
Also, we do not need to see Bran so many times. If nothing is happening with him, don't show him. Stannis hasn't been around for a while. Theon hasn't, the Boltons haven't. Because they're not relevant.Â 
Â 
Even the Viper has missed an episode and he only has 3 more. I would have liked to spend some more time with the Viper. Maybe mention that he is called the Viper, since they haven't yet. Maybe show something about the Viper that actually occurred in the books. How about those cool convos with Tyrion? They're probably coming up.
Â 
Yea, some people can be entertained and distracted by swords and fire. "I like the part where Jon fought with the sword, because swords are cool and Jon is a good guy and he fights with a sword and kills bad guys with a sword with a wolf's head on the handle because Jon is a really good fighter. I like swords. Then he set Craster's keep on fire because Craster's was a place of evil where he raped his daughters, raping is bad and so setting fire to it was a good thing and makes Jon a good guy because he burned a place of evil with fire. His is the Song of Ice and Fire... and swords. I like the part where the swords were fighting each other. That was cool. It was like *clang* *clang* then Jon stabbed him. And Grenn stabbed a guy too. And Edd. They all stabbed guys but no one stabbed them because they were better. Jon got stabbed, but he was ok because he is good and good guys can get stabbed in the belly and be ok. Especially if its Jon, because he has curly hair and likes wildlings. He forgot he got stabbed in the stomach and stabbed Karl in the face with his sword with the wolf's head because Karl was bad and about to hurt that lady. Jon saved the day and forgot about the hole in his stomach. Jon doesn't bleed because his is the blood of the first men and wolves. Wolves are animals and are kind of like dogs and that makes them good guys."
Â 
Bran also forced a mentally retarded fellow to brutally snap another person's neck, traumatizing him for life and then felt no remorse over it. What a noble and heroic sacrifice Bran made for the good of himself. This made Bran seem like a true hero. Honestly, though, this actor plays Bran so pompously. I want somebody to hit Bran. He is such a dick to everyone.
3470	AnotherCrannogman	2014-05-05	I liked the fight scene and thought Karl was pretty flat and over-acted.
3471	Ankou	2014-05-05	When there are literally thousands of pages of source material to draw from (and now presumably the thousand or so WOW pages that could fall into the show at any moment) to even be discussing a plot line that spans over multiple episodes as filler, is a failure on the writers part, in my opinion.
They can add filler and do it well (which they have as far as entertainment value goes) but that is entirely separate from whether or not it was good for the overall story. All signs point to no on that front.


Not if they're pacing it and have to worry about keeping characters involved. They can't use 20 pages of cake descriptions involving characters nobody knows to maintain viewer interest.Â
3472	Gail	2014-05-05	Umm... because Jon and especially Bran are already in ADWD territory, while the others are still in Â SOS.Â  
Â 
Jon and Dany are unsullied faves that's why they're giving them more screentime.Â 

					
					
							Edited by Gail, 05 May 2014 - 10:39 AM.
3473	Jairion Lannister	2014-05-05	I thought it was fairly good. People are judging it as filler from what they know of the books, but that shouldn't be the case. It should be judged from the perspective of the show and what this meant.
Â 
Jon had already made it clear that failure to eliminate the rogue NW men would mean the Wildlings would soon realise that they could easily attack the Wall and take it as they didn't have as many men as Jon had told them. From a show watchers perspective, that's the point here; they want to see whether Jon can eliminate these men and maintain the silence that the NW isn't equipped to hold the Wall. The scenes at Crasters are intended to remind us of what they're up against; of who they're facing and so we can get some satisfaction from these guys being killed.
Â 
The part with Bran is filler until he reaches the three eyed crow, but it was good filler. For a show viewer, who doesn't know whether Bran will be successful, it creates more tension. What will happen? Will Bran's group survive? Will Bran and Jon be reunited? I wish we'd have seen Coldhands, but even then this creates a lot of tension and puts our protagonists in tight stops, where we wonder if they'll survive or not.
Â 
The most disappointing part was after all of the build up, Locke was simply killed in the end when he could've served a really good purpose to the NW storyline, although apart from that most of those storyline was done quite well.
3474	Ankou	2014-05-05	I don't see why Locke taking Bran alive is so odd. He still needs to find Rickon, so he can interrogate him himself or let Roose do it. It's not like he knew how dangerous Bran was. To him he was a crippled child who had three chained up friends.Â

Â 
Filler.Â  Convoluted, empty, unfulfilling and contrived. Â 


 Â Â 
Â 
to clue you into my personal POV:Â  I read the books before watching GoT, pondered them, became almost obsessed with them, then watched the HBO series.Â  I've loved the tv version until the last 3 episodes.Â  I'm not a book purist, but I at least was looking for a show that tells the story in the books more accurately, like the LoTR movies did for Tolkeins story.Â  GRRM's storyÂ deserves no less.Â Â The divergences from the books are growing more disturbing, to the point of rendering the plot almost unrecognizable as ASOIAF.Â  While I realize a LOT of what happens in both the Bran and Jon storylines is mostly internal character development in the books, which it seems a lot of people find "boring".Â  (I don't.) Â D&D should pick the interesting parts of the books and use those for their script inventions.Â  They could've used a Coldhands scene and embellish it for example.Â  Why didn't they just drop Locke at about the same time Vargo leaves the storyline in the books... why bring himÂ to the wall?Â  What exactly did they accomplish with that?Â  There are so many interesting things to happen at the Wall w/Jon.Â  They could've just moved the Mance story up instead of inventing whole an entirely new storyline.Â  I just don't get it, and I really don't like it.Â  If what they care about is capturing the attention of the unsullied, then they should have written their own story to begin with.
Â 
ps.Â  No one is mentioning the fact the Karl gave Jon a nasty stab wound to the gut.Â  Kit hardly even gave a nod to such a nasty wound in his performance afterward, as though it were merely a scratch.Â  CouldÂ Karl have been fulfilling the function of Bowen Marsh in the books?Â  Will that wound eventually bring Jon down the way Bowen did?
Just wondering what you guys think.

That takes time he may not have, and in addition he'd probably have to do it in front of Bran and that would make interrogating him harder.Â

Â 
Why? Â Sorry. Â It's illogical. Â If he doesn't kill the 3 and they survive they will tell Jon that he took Bran and not only will "everyone" know Bran is alive but Jon will set out in pursuit of him. Â Also, not sure how killing his companions is going to make a child less able to withstand the coming torture....
Â 
I don't have a problem w/the Craster/Bran storyline per se, but it wasn't executed that well...because it has lots of logic gaps. Â The deserters are going to kill everyone or try and get ransom money for them? Â Seems like both and neither, LOL.Â 
Â 
Also, how long is it going to take to slit the throats of 3 chained up people? Â A minute?

3483	sj4iy	2014-05-05	Don't care if it was filler or not...it's the best kind of filler. Â The kind that is exciting and gratifying. Â Martin himself uses a LOT of filler that's nowhere near as fun or interesting.
Â 
Best villian death by far, one of the best fight scenes by far. Â Count me happy.
3484	I'm_Tim	2014-05-05	Why do people have to be so judgemental about everything? Especially with this show- it really confuses me.
Â 
Sure, while it did not serve too much of a bigger purpose, the Craster scene was, in my opinion, one of the best sequences the show has ever done... Especially the scene with Jojen's vision and then his talk with Bran (Thomas Brodie Sangster for episode MVP). That scene is now probably my favourite sequence in the entire show. What happened to Bran in this episode was definitely more interesting than anything that has happened to him in the books It made me care a lot more for him, Jojen, Meera as well as Jon and Grenn. I, for one thought it was a great sequence.
Â 
Why can't people be happy with awesomeness without thinking too deeply about its bigger purpose?

Unfortunately the forum has created a culture of haters. It's a message board, so it's to be expected.
A lot of Martin's story doesn't translate well to TV. These deviations are necessary. These episodes have been fantastic at character development.
The viewing audience is now engaged and interested in the North. Unfortunately, I could almost hear their collective sigh when Dany announced she's staying in Slaver's Bay. 
These next 2 seasons are really important. Not much happens in the books and they're somewhat poorly written. The show runners are going to have their work cut out to keep the viewers interested.
3485	DemiNymph	2014-05-05	I'm not opposed to this filler part. I'm just disappointed at Locke's character arc. What a waste. He could have done more to the story and they killed him off. And this isn't even a "ohh my fave character got killed" type of thing. The writers ain't GRRM. Only GRRM knows how to kill someone and make the audience really shocked and/or miss that character. When the writers killed Locke, I was like, "Eh? So they created a useless character?"
So Locke is basically another Ros, ableit, without tits. Just like Ros was a substitute for Alayaya, Locke was a substitute for Vargo Hoat. They did a terrible job with the Ros character but for a moment there I thought they did good with Locke and that he was a improvement to the story. But they created this character and used him to accomplish nothing other than to plump up Bran's part of the story. They can't even kill him off with finesse. Bah.Â
3486	King Nothing	2014-05-05	So basically "filler" in the books is called "character development". And in the shows it is just called "filler".
Â 
You have to keep in mind the unsullied did not know Bran & Jon would not meet. My friends were visibily excited for them to finally re-connect, and it was a big deal when Bran made the decision to continue North

Â 
to clue you into my personal POV:Â  I read the books before watching GoT, pondered them, became almost obsessed with them, then watched the HBO series.Â  I've loved the tv version until the last 3 episodes.Â  I'm not a book purist, but I at least was looking for a show that tells the story in the books more accurately, like the LoTR movies did for Tolkeins story.Â  GRRM's storyÂ deserves no less.Â Â The divergences from the books are growing more disturbing, to the point of rendering the plot almost unrecognizable as ASOIAF.Â  While I realize a LOT of what happens in both the Bran and Jon storylines is mostly internal character development in the books, which it seems a lot of people find "boring".Â  (I don't.) Â D&D should pick the interesting parts of the books and use those for their script inventions.Â  They could've used a Coldhands scene and embellish it for example.Â  Why didn't they just drop Locke at about the same time Vargo leaves the storyline in the books... why bring himÂ to the wall?Â  What exactly did they accomplish with that?Â  There are so many interesting things to happen at the Wall w/Jon.Â  They could've just moved the Mance story up instead of inventing whole an entirely new storyline.Â  I just don't get it, and I really don't like it.Â  If what they care about is capturing the attention of the unsullied, then they should have written their own story to begin with.
Â 
ps.Â  No one is mentioning the fact the Karl gave Jon a nasty stab wound to the gut.Â  Kit hardly even gave a nod to such a nasty wound in his performance afterward, as though it were merely a scratch.Â  CouldÂ Karl have been fulfilling the function of Bowen Marsh in the books?Â  Will that wound eventually bring Jon down the way Bowen did?
Just wondering what you guys think.


Â 
You can't be serious. Â The LotR movies diverged from the books in many, many ways and far more than GoT has done. Â And the definition of a 'book purist' is someone who doesn't want the story to diverge from the books at all, which you are saying you want. Â And he wasn't stabbed in the gut, he was stabbed in the hip (or thigh). Â Hence Jon limping afterwards.

3489	Winterfell is Burning	2014-05-05	It makes perfect sense to spend time at Craster's: in the books, it's kind of a stretch to see Jon elected Lord Commander. Here, they are building it better, showing he's already popular, and killing the men that murdered Jeor will make him even more.
Â 
Plus, it gives Bran something to do and shows him going further into the dark side.

What gets my goat is that they had to spend money to hire these actors to play, when they could have spent the money & time on Coldhands and probably gotten less grief and better reviews from critics and fans alike.
3491	protar	2014-05-05	Disappointed that Locke's story was cut short so quickly when he could have acted as a composite character for a bit longer. The only real consequence of this piece of filler is Jon being reunited with Ghost, although maybe one of the Craster's Wives (the one who stabbed Karl) will end up going to the Wall and taking the role of Val or something? Who knows?

Job well done.Â 


Badass? He got his ass kicked by a guy with two knives even though he had a huge sword made of quasi-magical steel. Any half-competent swordsman would've won this fight with ease due to the vastly superior range of his weapon.
Â 
Anyway, I didn't mind this subplot much, some good acting and impressive visuals, but too many stupid moments. The justification for Jon and company to go there was just stupid. How the hell did Locke know that this kid was Brandon Stark? What are the women supposed to do after the keep was burned? The way Bran and co got captured was just dumb, etc...

Â 
Fixed that for you. Â Range means nothing when you don't have the space to swing the sword...which Jon didn't. Â You can see how he ran into the wall and didn't have the space to use his weapon correctly. Â And Tanner was never a slouch- he was one of the best fighters and well known for it. Â I liked that they made it realistic fight where Jon isn't the best fighter of all time already. Â This isn't Star Wars- Jon still has a lot to learn.

Apparently you don't realize something Oberyn pointed out early on. A longsword isn't too great a weapon in close quarters and each weapon has it's advantages and disadvantages. Karl was clearly a lot faster than Jon and swinging a sword doesn't always go as quick and smoothly as many Hollywood flicks make it look.

I loved his lines in book five. You're right that he creates more mystery than answers, I guess I just like that. Plus a huge guy on a dead elk and we don't even know what kind of creature he is? Awesomesauce.
3498	The Kinkslayer	2014-05-05	...
Also: WTF are Craster's wives going to do? They have no arms, just burned their only shelter, and have likely never left the keep before. Where are they going to go? Why would they not simply stay at the only place they've ever known? Or at least take the nice guy who just saved your lives up on his offer to take you to a warmer place with no ice zombies? How will they survive in the permanently frozen wasteland that is the show's Beyond the Wall? Is there any explanation even possible for what their next move is? They don't seem to want to go to Mance(who they have no way of finding besides) given they want to "make their own way."
...

Craster's wives become: the MOLE MOTHERS, sending the wildings to the gods, salvation where they once found damnation.
3499	David Selig	2014-05-05	Well, if Jon Snow had two brain cells to rub together, he could've gone outside and fight there.

3501	Ankou	2014-05-05	Â 
Why? Â Sorry. Â It's illogical. Â If he doesn't kill the 3 and they survive they will tell Jon that he took Bran and not only will "everyone" know Bran is alive but Jon will set out in pursuit of him. Â Also, not sure how killing his companions is going to make a child less able to withstand the coming torture....
Â 
I don't have a problem w/the Craster/Bran storyline per se, but it wasn't executed that well...because it has lots of logic gaps. Â The deserters are going to kill everyone or try and get ransom money for them? Â Seems like both and neither, LOL.Â 
Â 
Also, how long is it going to take to slit the throats of 3 chained up people? Â A minute?


Â 
I could imagine someone getting a little panicky after months of looking for a kid.Â
3502	Night's_King	2014-05-05	Haven't read everything of this thread, I'll just just answer the OP.
Â 
I have no problem with a good filler. And this was good. I didn't like Hoats end in the books, this was awesome. We had action, we had great scenes, and especially the warging into Hodor and his shock of having someone killed finally showed how much of a crime it is to warg into humans. I also liked what they did with Jon.
Â 
What I didn't like: Using raping just to show some more tits, the last minute arrival of the NW and the fighting scenes were badly executed.
Â 
All in all a good filler. I have seen much worse (Any fellow Naruto/One Piece/Bleach/... fans here?)

It's questionable how, with all their realistic sword fighting lip service (ie from the hound), they have a guy crisscross two knives to block a downward thrust from a bastard sword. Not to mention it's Valyrian.Â
3504	northernwind	2014-05-05	Yeah it was unnecessary and could be considered filler. However I'm really glad they added it. It's given something Jon to do while waiting for the climax of this season, and obviously no one knew exactly how it would play out. It was really fun to watch.
3505	TheWeepingMan	2014-05-05	The motives for the raid are not entirely implausible, are they? Revenge for Jeor Mormont and preventing information leaking to the wildlings - seems like a legit motivation for me and stays true to the rationality established in the canon.
3506	David Selig	2014-05-05	Got to say I laugh out loud when Jon managed to penetrate the whole skull of Carl, end to end, in one thrust - like it is made of butter. Wow, that Valyrian steel must really be something else!

Craster's Keep burning is a cathartic moment that supplies a solid mid-season beat for Jon and Bran. Well done.

3531	Ser Not Appearing	2014-05-05	Firstly you've got the show's seasonal ebb and flow to consider. This gave them a mid-season bad guy and climax/resolution. Not entirely a bad thing for the show and understandable for them to seek such things out.
Secondly, and more importantly, this served to showcase Jon the leader and Jon the warrior which will make his eventual election far more believable to show watchers. It advanced his character on screen.
It was filler but it wasn't pointless filler and it was well done. We'll get over it.
3532	TheBadboy	2014-05-05	I wonder if people have read Feast and Dance...
Â 
Lets sum it up
Â 
Bran - Walks and walks till he reaches a cave in the final two chapters
Brienne- Walks and walks till she reaches UnCat in her final chapter.
Sam- Walks and walks till he reaches Oldtown in final chapter.
Arya- Walks and walks with Sandor killing evil guys , till she reaches Bravos.
Tyrion- Sails and Fucks and drinks till he reaches Mereen.
Â 
Fuckin Dany - Sits her ass in a far away continent doing nothing except solving day to day problems and banging Daario.
Â 
Â 
So BY THE LOGIC of all the people who are saying its a filler --- What purpose did the countless travelogues serve (except a few). Why not just get to the end ? We could have simply have a point of view when the leave a place and when they reach the other .Â 
Â 
The books have much more longer yet much much much more boring fillers than the show. Glad to see a change. Â AFFC and ADWD are basically fillers

3533	Miodrag	2014-05-05	NaarioDaharis (OP),
Â 
Unfortunately, this was not a filler. Behindâ<U+0080><U+0099>s D&Dâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ridiculous â<U+0080><U+009C>creativityâ<U+0080><U+009D> there is always a system, there is always some reasoning no competent writer would ever think of. Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the worst part in their incompetence. And, all this Northern mess was because of a â<U+0080><U+009C>butterfly effectâ<U+0080><U+009D>.
Â 
Now, many show-apologists hate the term, because it brings back the whole concept of context, which, actually, can produce a number of problems for incompetent writers like D&D, but the context does play a role in sagas like this one. You see, Jon indeed has to be established as a leader. And, in the books, Martin managed that. How? Well, by efficiently using Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s chapters. For example, in book two we saw how respected Jon was by one of the most respected fighters and leaders in the realm â<U+0080><U+0093> Qhorin Halfhand. After those chapters, readers practically donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need to be persuaded any more Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a leader material. That Jon was trusted by Aemon and Jeor, too, also helped. Opposite to that, in the TV show we had this:
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re even dumber than you look.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
That is what Qhorin says to Jon in their first proper conversation, after he tastes Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s manners and maturity for the first time. Funny enough, that was their last proper conversation as well â<U+0080><U+0093> soon after, they got separated (again, because of Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pure incompetence), and when theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re reunited episodes later, theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re both captured by the wildlings and Qhorinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s even more angry at Jon, just as anyone would be, considering Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s stupidity was the reason the mission went so wrong. Not to mention that TV Aemon never expressed any praise about Jon, while TV Jeor kinda liked the lad, but thought very little of him. So, basically, out of three main authority figures Jon encounters after joining NW, none was trilled with Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s abilities nor potentials, and one was openly furious at him.
Â 
Then, in season 3, weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re witnessing Jon constantly being humiliated by Ygritte, who in the show is a girl of impeccable wisdom, able to outsmart and/or ridicule Jon on any topic they happen to discuss.

3534	TheBadboy	2014-05-05	NaarioDaharis (OP),
Â 
Unfortunately, this was not a filler. Behindâ<U+0080><U+0099>s D&Dâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ridiculous â<U+0080><U+009C>creativityâ<U+0080><U+009D> there is always a system, there is always some reasoning no competent writer would ever think of. Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the worst part in their incompetence. And, all this Northern mess was because of a â<U+0080><U+009C>butterfly effectâ<U+0080><U+009D>.
Â 
Now, many show-apologists hate the term, because it brings back the whole concept of context, which, actually, can produce a number of problems for incompetent writers like D&D, but the context does play a role in sagas like this one. You see, Jon indeed has to be established as a leader. And, in the books, Martin managed that. How? Well, by efficiently using Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s chapters. For example, in book two we saw how respected Jon was by one of the most respected fighters and leaders in the realm â<U+0080><U+0093> Qhorin Halfhand. After those chapters, readers practically donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need to be persuaded any more Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a leader material. That Jon was trusted by Aemon and Jeor, too, also helped. Opposite to that, in the TV show we had this:
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re even dumber than you look.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
That is what Qhorin says to Jon in their first proper conversation, after he tastes Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s manners and maturity for the first time. Funny enough, that was their last proper conversation as well â<U+0080><U+0093> soon after, they got separated (again, because of Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pure incompetence), and when theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re reunited episodes later, theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re both captured by the wildlings and Qhorinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s even more angry at Jon, just as anyone would be, considering Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s stupidity was the reason the mission went so wrong. Not to mention that TV Aemon never expressed any praise about Jon, while TV Jeor kinda liked the lad, but thought very little of him. So, basically, out of three main authority figures Jon encounters after joining NW, none was trilled with Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s abilities nor potentials, and one was openly furious at him.
Â 
Then, in season 3, weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re witnessing Jon constantly being humiliated by Ygritte, who in the show is a girl of impeccable wisdom, able to outsmart and/or ridicule Jon on any topic they happen to discuss. While she possibly doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think Jon is â<U+0080><U+009C>even dumber than he looksâ<U+0080><U+009D>, Ygritte exposed any number of holes in Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s attitude toward life and his views on the world, and, letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not forget, she was so superior to him she actually spared his life, as Tormund explained at the beginning of the season 4.

Such vitriol. Why not simply stop watching ?
3535	Miodrag	2014-05-05	^ That would prevent me from having these rewarding debates with posters like yourself.
3536	Khaleesi did nothing wrong	2014-05-05	Locke was utterly doomed regardless of what he or Bran or Hodor would have done.Â 
Â 
Look at the conditions and possible actions he could have taken.Â 
Â 
1. If he carries off Bran alone like he planned to, Meera and Jojen tells Jon which direction he went, he then just follows the tracks left in the snow or sets Ghost/Summer on it. Locke is on foot and carrying a boy, Jon is mounted. No chance.Â 
Â 
2. If he kills all other captives and then carries of Bran, Jon sees Hodor's corpse and Summer in the pens and notices that Locke is missing, and puts two and two together. Then repeat of scenario 1.Â 
Â 
3. If he somehow sneaks away with all captives without being seen while the Night's Watch are fighting literally just a couple of meters away, Jon still sees Summer in the pens and notices that Locke is missing. Repeat of scenario 1, except even faster since Locke is dragging 4 captives instead of 1.Â 
Â 
4. If he sneaks away with all captives while magical Space Jews beam Summer up to their ship, Jon still notices that Locke is missing and hunts him down as a deserter. Repeat of scenario 1.Â 
Â 
Really, this is without even mentioning the insurmountable task of getting over the wall while carrying Bran and then escaping the Night's Watch deserter-hunters on the other side that would come for him regardless, and are very good at their job (otherwise half the Night's Watch would have deserted already). Even if he kills Bran too to be able to move faster he'll still just get hunted down. So he had no chance at all. A bit of poor writing I guess, though I must say I really enjoyed this arc anyway. As filler it is as good as it gets, and it would not be possible to keep actors off or doing extremely little during two seasons without risking them leaving the project. It also served to get some tension into mid series episodes which some people have complained about a lack of in earlier seasons, so that was also good.Â 
Â 
So yeah, I liked it anyway.Â

It's possible he planned to kill the NW unit's horses and then ride off on his with Bran, I suppose.Â  Though that still doesn't explain what he was going to do when he got to the Wall (though the books are guilty of that too, I suppose).
3538	WSmith84	2014-05-05	I enjoyed it to a degree. There were a few things though that were pretty bizarre. Like, what was Locke's plan exactly? Kidnap Bran and drag him all the way back to the Wall (because that won't leave a trail) and leave the three people who saw you do it alive? What a genius. It seems like they wasted a potentially interesting secondary character with this (although the way in which he died was pretty cool). I feel like they could have done a lot more with him. The other thing is that the NW just charged in, all guns blazing, despite being told that there were only 11 men and that there were no guards posted. Surely you'd take a stealthy approach and kill as many of them as possible before fighting them openly.Â

Yeah, that would not work in practice though. He's going to kill off at least twenty large war horses* in at most a few minutes, and without anybody hearing their screams?Â 
Â 
As you say though, he would still not get away from the rest of the Night's Watch.Â 
Â 
Â 
*Horses that are trained to fight and actually very dangerous, who will totally freak out when he starts killing them.Â

Good point. Â Whatever Locke does Jon will find out that Bran was there, which makes it bad TV plotting.

Â 
Guess we'll never know. Â Dead men don't talk too much.
3542	fangirl000	2014-05-05	I found it to be entertaining filler that doesn't damage the story being told overall. Â 
Â 
- It gave Bran's character something to do other than wallow in his hunger and misery. Â  It gave him a little more agency by showing he is CHOOSING to go North, rather than just escaping with Jojen from the situation at Winterfell.
Â 
- I really liked the hint Jojen dropped about the future. Â 
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Meera: "How will we know it's the end?"Â 
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Jojen starting at his hand, which, to him, is on fucking fire: "You'll know."
Â 
Made me wonder if they're going to cross paths with Mel at some point. Â It seems to me she would gladly burn a Greenseer for being heretic.
Â 
- Â Leading the successful raid built up Jon's reputation and faction among men of the Watch. Â Burnishing Jon's reputation this way will make it easier for the audience to believe that the Night's Watch would elect a very young man - who spent a fair amount of time among the enemy and rather famously killed the very popular Half-Hand - Commander.Â 
Â 
- I wasn't happy about the rape rape rape hut being so vividly brought to the screen, but I was happy to see the bastards who did it die. Â And now the women are making their own choices about their future.Â 
Â 
- Ghost is back! Â They provided an explanation for his absence (albeit a dumb one), and the show can move forward.
Â 
All told, yes, the whole thing was a little side trip to make the TV show more interesting. But I don't think it damages the plot from the books. Â Â
3543	AZAXD	2014-05-05	Haha I love that you referred to the Jon VS Karl scene as a boss fight. I very much had the same feeling. Plus I don't handle gore very well and was pretty certain there was gonna be some nasty stabby business (as there was!) so it heightened the intensity for me haha. Which was fun.

Personally, perhaps it didn't have many big consequences but I think it really gave Jon his first chance to shine as a leader with his speech to rally his brothers about Mormont being the Watch's father. And I guess having Locke killed at least is an ending to one of the Bolton's leads. Speaking of typing up loose ends I guess it's nice to have a solid end to Craster's place, although his daughters are gonna be running about who knows where,
Being a dog-owner I loooooved seeing Jon reunited with Ghost. Yeah I know, weird that those bloody mutineers were able to trap a direwolf but I let that slide...
Â 
I wish he got to see Bran though. That's the bit that annoyed me most actually. I was hoping for (but not expecting because, come on) a really beautiful reunion. I was ready to shed a few tears for brotherly love as the two parted ways after a quick chat. Two near-misses with Jon and Bran feels a little cheap to me. At least Bran's AWESOME kill via Hodor (Yes I DID enjoy all the action quite a lot I guess) happened, that was pretty dark. And the chance to explore more of Jojen's abilities in a really visual way what with his hand on fire and seeing the great Weirwood behind Bran was really great.
Â 
OH and the whole potential book spoilery Other baby action that stemmed from Craster's was quite something!Â
3544	Hoo	2014-05-05	Other than Sansa plot, the whole episode was fodder.
3545	Rockroi	2014-05-05	1. If we don't like part of the show, that does not make us "Book Purists;" it just means the show did not live up to a certain high standard; one the show itself has had a hand in setting. Â 
Â 
2. Analogies- you have to keep reading. Â If you like 100% filler, just put more cow-lips and hooves in your hot-dogs instead of lean beef. Â Get it? Â 
Â 
Onto specifics:
Â 
So....basically your argument is that the information that was communicated in this sequence should have been split up into several different scenes. This means you simply fail yo acknowledge the severe constraints, particularly in terms of of run-time, that the show has.
Â 

Â 
Ah, no, but thanks for playing the "Executive Producer" card here in this debate. Â I cut the show a TON of slack because they only have 10 hours a year to tell this story. Â I say, use it wisely. Â You can build Jon's character and then have a scene with Bran and NOT resort to a silly, contrived cross-over where you do both ... but the two characters ... never intersect. Â So you take all the TIME of telling two stories, but none of the time-saving (we had to constantly cut back and forth between Jon and Bran, but the two NEVER interacted so you get no scene that does everything ONCE; we had to do it all twice)." Â You can have Jon liberate the women at Craster's Keep to build his character. Â Why did Bran have to be there? Â You could just as easily have two scenes with Bran and move on. Â Frankly, I think they need to just disassociate from Bran because the story for Bran is very simple and you don't have much to work with. Â That is NOT an excuse to be silly or flippant with that story. Â 
Â 

Â 
They NEED to compress things together and communicate as much development as possible in as few scenes as possible. Your argument requires adding another 3 episodes just to accommodate the scenes you think should have happened instead.Â 
Â 

Â 
Oh God, no. Â It would take probably LESS time than what the show invested in the silly scenes we saw. Â You would not need 3 episodes; you would need about 3 total scenes, many of which would be less than what we saw AND have the added benefit of not having to figure out how a team of men were able to traverse 60 miles in a shorter span of time it took somebody to go that same distance ... in 2 months. Â 
Â 
The time it would take to show a preliminary wildling attack on the wall for the same purpose of establishing Jon as a battle commander would have been about the same, but would not have advanced Bran's story or the Hardhome story simultaneously.
Â 

Â 
WHAT HARDHOME STORY!?!?!?!? Â There's a Hardhome story? Â Where is it in the books? Â A crazy-lady takes people to die near some ice. Â In the book? Â Go crazy; you have unlimited pages. Â In the show? Â CUT. IT! Â We don't have time. Nobody- I SWEAR NOBODY- cares about that story who watches the show; it will not be missed. Â What a lame reason to detour the whole show. Â 
Â 
Bran should have 2 or 3 scenes a season; his story is notÂ interesting; stop contriving it to make us pretend that it can be interesting. Â StopÂ sacrificing quality on the alter of "Let'sÂ PretendÂ Bran is Interesting." Â 
Â 
As for Hardhome and the Woods Witch.....seriously? You don't care? That's your argument? You do realize that the events at Hardhome are quite a big deal in Jon's future story right? Probably in Bran's story as well.Â 
Â 

Â 
Or not. Â 
Â 
Seriously, that's my answer. Â We have no idea if a weird witch has ANY impact on this story ... in fact, I would bet she has ZERO impact on the story the viewers care about. Â And its besides the point: you don't need to describe it to the guidance of the show in a needless side-track to Craster's Keep. Â 
Â 
In case people don't remember there is more to the North than Craster's KLeep. Â I've been lead to believe there are like 10 maybe 15 people who don't live there. Â But going by the reactions of some EVERY CHARACTER who may be important some day maybe ... must be explained ... so put them at Craster's Keep. Â 
Â 
But fuck the ToJ; and who cares about who sent the cutthroat to actually kill Bran. Â Don't actually EXPLAIN the show or the motivations of major characters. Â But the Hardhome woman who may or may not be important - give her 4 episodes of backstory. Â And I was the one lectured on the time issues. Â I mean, if Lady Hardhome is so important- riddle me this: is Lyanna Stark important or not to Jon's Story? Â What about the ToJ? Â Guess how much story has been filled in there? Â 
Â 
But by all means, lets pretend these last two episodes have been important. Â

3546	Yelloweyedemon	2014-05-05	Just one simple question... WHY?!Â 
Â 
Is it SO HARD to just stick to the books, introduce Coldhands, and save precious time without having to worry about plotholes (which btw the episode had so many).
Â 
Instead of the meaningless 20 mins+ meaningless sword and fire scene at crasters.
Â 
Plus with the right introduction and scene, the show fans would love a character like Coldhands.
Â

Don't forget that Craters widows know about the captives in all likelyhood. I'm suprised they did not mention it before the compound was burned down to the ground. Maybe they clear this up a little next episode, I can live with it, some of it was even good but a little too much head scratching for me not to deduct a point or two.

I didn't read all that wall of text, but after seing this, are you serious? Bran has the most intresting story by FAR.

A young boy going to a trip in some undiscovered lands seeking the mystery behind the white walkers, and finding an intelligent wight, the remaining CotF and the last greenseer is NOT intresting? Yeah, maybe they should cut all that and show a 20 min made up sex scene.
3549	sj4iy	2014-05-05	WHAT HARDHOME STORY!?!?!?!? Â There's a Hardhome story? Â Where is it in the books? Â A crazy-lady takes people to die near some ice. Â In the book? Â Go crazy; you have unlimited pages. Â In the show? Â CUT. IT! Â We don't have time. Nobody- I SWEAR NOBODY- cares about that story who watches the show; it will not be missed. Â What a lame reason to detour the whole show. Â ...and considering that we haven't seen how that story ends, how are you so sure that it's pointless? Or are you just really good at guessing this sort of thing?
It may get cut, it may not. I don't see what that has to do with the story right now, though, or why you would get so worked up over something that won't happen for a long time. But they didn't 'detour' the show for that reason. In fact, this wasn't a detour at all- it was still a scene that still happened in the books, but in a different way. Replacing Coldhands with Jon and his men was not a detour.

3550	Roose Seal	2014-05-05	Locke trying to sneak off with Bran was so ridiculous and funny, it looked like a Scooby Doo villain just kidnapped Daphne while the rest of the gang runs around in circles. I half-expected him to go "myeheheh" as he ran away. What the fuck was his plan?Â 

Good lord this show is so dumb sometimes.
3551	acosta	2014-05-05	I still think there is a chance Coldhands will end up being someone we'd recognize, which would be impossible to hide on the show, and they don't want to give that away just yet. Not sure who, though, since I think Benjen Stark can be ruled out.
3552	Metopheles	2014-05-05	I didn't read all that wall of text, but after seing this, are you serious? Bran has the most intresting story by FAR.

Neither is Â he going on a trip in some undiscovered lands, nor does he find out anything about White Walkers, nor an intelligent wight(That is a speculation).

Why so? New actor + make up (probably walking dead style) along with CGI and you can't recognise anything. Plus having him completelly cut from the show usually means that he won't have an important role in the next 2 books (if any Â at all)... Why should we get a spoiler like that?
3554	Yelloweyedemon	2014-05-05	Neither is Â he going on a trip in some undiscovered lands, nor does he find out anything about White Walkers, nor an intelligent wight(That is a speculation).


The lands northen of the wall are officially un-discovered. None has ever seen a CotF and bran found them all. Coldhands is so far in the book an intelligent wight. Melisandre's vision with BR and Bran strongly suggests that bran's story is extremelly important in relation to White walkers.
Â 
You have no clue what you're talking about.
3555	Sun	2014-05-05	I enjoyed it to a degree. There were a few things though that were pretty bizarre. Like, what was Locke's plan exactly? Kidnap Bran and drag him all the way back to the Wall (because that won't leave a trail) and leave the three people who saw you do it alive? What a genius. It seems like they wasted a potentially interesting secondary character with this (although the way in which he died was pretty cool). I feel like they could have done a lot more with him. The other thing is that the NW just charged in, all guns blazing, despite being told that there were only 11 men and that there were no guards posted. Surely you'd take a stealthy approach and kill as many of them as possible before fighting them openly.Â 


Â 
Yes, this expresses my feelings about the Craster's sequence perfectly. And what was he going to do when he got to the Wall? HOw was he going to explain the crippled kid and lack of brothers?
Â 
And what a pointless waste it was, narratively speaking, to bring Locke all the way up to the wall and then kill him pointlessly with such little dramatic effect. Â 
Â 
ETA:
Â 
Locke was sent up there to find Bran and Jon, to get rid of them for Bolton. Why didn't he just kill Bran & Co. while he had the chance and blame it on the mutineers?? Why take Bran when there;s nowhere for him to go but the Wall?

3556	jarl the climber	2014-05-05	^ That would prevent me from having these rewarding debates with posters like yourself.


Its hard to really debate you on the merits of your arguements. Jons arc in the TV show has been butchered to an extent. They handled him OK in the first season but he failed to establish himself as a competent subordinate who could follow orders in season 2. Still with a few exceptions everyone on the ranging is dead so they don't know about his incompetence, it actually looks like he infiltrated the wildlings according to his orders and delivered relavent intelligence to the Watch at great personal risk. He has now become a junior officer of sorts because at least hes not a thief, rapist, mutineer or dead.
Â 
I think being dumber than he looked worked to his advantage with Ygritte. Hes like the wildling equivalent of a trophy husband. Hes really only good at one thing but fortunately for him that's the only thing he needs to be good at.
Â 
Still, here we have a guy who has become a junior officer by default, who has gotten by on luck and maybe his good looks rather than any sort of skill or intelligence. I suppose he still has 4 more epsiodes to build up his rep. They did good work at Crasters, they killed 10 to losing 4, and those guys were all hardened killers. Yeah, Jon had to be bailed out by one the women but that will help keep him humble and he won't forget that going forward and he will never discount a persons worth  . It was still a stretch for him getting elected in the books, it was really only the feud between Mallister and Pyke plus his Stark blood and upbringing that made it possible so if the same factors are present in the TV show I don't think it will be unbelievable, ecspecailly if he does well in the coming battles.

The more I think about it, they should have left Locke at the wall and found a different way for Bran to get free..because there is nothing about his actions that make sense or would have worked out unless as you say, he just killed everyone, at least that way he would have gotten one Stark out of the 3.

Well, not to justify the stupidity... But Locke did say to Jon just before they ran in - "there is a hut on the far side that had some hounds tied up that we should avoid" or something to that extent. lol
3560	Envie	2014-05-05	Well, not to justify the stupidity... But Locke did say to Jon just before they ran in - "there is a hut on the far side that had some hounds tied up that we should avoid" or something to that extent. lol


Â 
Yeah I had to wonder what Plan B would have been if Hodor hadn't snapped his neck.
Â 
He basically flat out lied to Jon before they ran in about avoiding that hut on the side because it had hounds tied up - so there's no way he was going to stay with the Night's Watch after that fight had he lived. Was he really expecting to just grab Bran and run off into the night with him 60 miles from the wall? Where or how was he going to get back across the wall and back to Roose Bolton?Â
3561	roxWolfox	2014-05-05	Yes, it was a filler because Bran was essentually forgotten for 2 novels. I wonder if we will get an Osha/Rickon/Shaggy scene this year, probably the last episode.


The only reason the long, dragged-out scene with the White Walker on horse with baby worked was because of the hint of horror/suspense.Â  We watched it unsure of what was going to happen, and some of us were quite relieved the way it did end.Â  Watching Bran and Company in that same scene (walking through the cold, stark, ice-filled landscape) over and over and over again would truly be useless filler.Â  Plus, what are they to do with the actors on contract? Give them all 20K pounds and tell them to report to duty the following year?Â 
And now I miss Rickon and Company! :sniffle:
Â 

BUt before I begin I just want to ask people if they like Clam Chowder? Â What do you like about it. Â For me- call me silly- but I like the actual clams, and not the filler of the potatoes. Â 
Â 
Keep that in mind. Â 
Â 
Â 
You can do all of this without including Bran.Â  Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s attack on Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s â<U+0080><U+0093> while certainly having the odor of contrivance â<U+0080><U+0093> can be explained by saying that if those men get captured they may reveal the NW true strength and they are deserters.Â  So, using it as a â<U+0080><U+009C>character builderâ<U+0080><U+009D> for Jon works, but no need to include the time-sync that is Bran.Â 
Â 
Â 
We already knew all that- if being tethered to Ygritte etc for an entire season didn't convince you that he respects wildings and women, nothing will.Â  We donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need it to be reinforced because we donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have the time.Â  Further, you could have accomplished all this by having a scene between Jon and Gilly at the Wall; 5 minutes- done. No need to waste two episodes. Â 
Â 
Â 
Donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care.Â  The fact that they are laying back-story to a 4th-level character does not interest me.Â  Hereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s an idea â<U+0080><U+0093> why not lay the back-story of the PRIMARY characters instead?!Â  You know like Ned and Jaime and Tyrion- characters we actually NEED to know something about and not a character whoâ<U+0080>¦ is actually not a character.Â  The show does not have the luxury of that kind of time.Â 
Â 
Which is why I have a problem with it and why the OP is correct- it was filler.Â  Like eatingÂ  clam chowder- you can tell if its good or not after the first bite; if you taste mostly potatoes â<U+0080><U+0093> the filler- you know you are eating cheap stuff.Â  But get mostly clams? That's what you paid for! Â 
Â 
I paid for Tyrion; for Brienne; Dany, Jaime, Tywin, Stannis, Arya, Sansa, Jon (they made me do it) and not the "woman-who-we-sort-of-heard-about-for-like-4-total-paragraphs-in-book-five." Â I can do without that; THAT is the potatoes. Â The fact that there is a REASON for potatoes or the fact that some people may like potatoes does not change the fact that its filler. I paid for the clams, thanks. Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Again, you could have done that in an independent scene, with Bran making Hodor do something and Hodor not liking it; it could even have been killing somebody.Â  You donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need to send Bran on a magical collision-course with Jon Snow in the â<U+0080><U+009C>Magnetic-Zoneâ<U+0080><U+009D> that is CRasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Keep that just attracts every major character in the books.Â  Fuck, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m surprised we didn't find Stannis and Khal Drogo up there.Â 
Â 
.
Â 
I got bad news for you: Branâ<U+0080><U+0099>s story IS an endlessly boring travel up North.Â  Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what that is.Â  You send somebody up North donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t expect that to be a â<U+0080><U+009C>page-turner.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â  And even if its boring, its better than Gerrymandering a system where two characters can kinda-sorta-but-not-really connect.Â  Another bait-and-switch.Â  We donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need that.
Â 
What we need is well developed story-arcs tethered to the foundation of the underlying narrative; not silly sidetracks and â<U+0080>¦ potatoes.Â 
Â 
Â 
Again, have Ghost show up at the Wall like it was in the books.Â  I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know anyone who was sitting on the edge of their seats trying to figure out the complexities of â<U+0080>¦. Of â<U+0080>¦ having a wolfâ<U+0080>¦ goâ<U+0080>¦ South.Â  Wow.Â  You donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need an ultra-silly and convoluted set-up just to get Ghost back with Jon.Â  Andâ<U+0080>¦ why was Ghost there to begin with?Â  Oh, thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s right- potatoes.Â 
Â 
Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s all that was; an excuse to have the show serve us potatoes and hope we forget about the clams.Â 
Â 
Filler.Â  Convoluted, empty, unfulfilling and contrived. Â 


First of all, it depends on what kind of Clam Chowder you like.Â  Manhattan or New England?Â  If it's New England, you don't need potatoes.Â 
I couldn't help but think of Sherlock vs Elementary when reading through this.Â  As a major Sherlock fan, I thumbed my nose at ever watching Elementary: how could you compare a 20+ episode show with an amazing 3 episode show for starters (we won't even go into the reasons they made Watson female) because the amount of filler would be extraordinary, no?
Then I started watching Elementary a few days ago, and to my surprise, I had to stop off at episode 14.Â  And not once had I been bored in that 11 hour marathon.Â  It's all in how well the acting/scenes/storylines get played out, I guess.Â  Then again, it could be a matter of 'viewer taste'.
Â 


So basically "filler" in the books is called "character development". And in the shows it is just called "filler".
Â 
You have to keep in mind the unsullied did not know Bran & Jon would not meet. My friends were visibily excited for them to finally re-connect, and it was a big deal when Bran made the decision to continue North


I just can't say how much I loved the bolded part.Â Â  
Â 


This thread: The Definition of Book Bias.
Â 
I would gladly take this sort of filler instead of Bran and Co waddling about for the second consecutive season.Â 


I agree completely.
Â 


Got to say I laugh out loud when Jon managed to penetrate the whole skull of Carl, end to end, in one thrust - like it is made of butter. Wow, that Valyrian steel must really be something else!
Â 
Funny how it was completely useless against two daggers a minute before that...


Being an avid D&D video-gamer, I couldn't help but chuckle at this.Â  
Â 


Wow, everyone's a critic. Armchair critics at that. Unless of course you've actually done sword fighting and dual wielding knife fighting in a small hut ... and sorry, that level 80 rogue in World of Warcraft doesn't count.Â  


Awww.Â  I was so geeked when Karl turned out to be a rogue.Â  I always pick two handed dagger/dirk rogues over warriors when picking a character!Â  Except in Dark Souls ... only game I've ever played where having a BF Sword comes in handy.
But yeah, a large sword in a small space is a recipe for disaster.Â

He himself probably wouldn't have gotten away with that though. I mean, he makes the rest of the Night's Watch stay away from the hut because he saw it was full of angry dogs when he scouted it, and then whooops! Turns out Jon's dead brother, Hodor and two other corpses were actually inside instead. Tough time to talk himself out of that one.Â 
Â 
Locke's role is just really poorly thought out.Â

If he kills Bran he won't find out where Rickon is.


Â 
doesn't Locke make it in the books? continuing pillaging with the mummers?Â 
Â 
i think the whole point of this sequence was
Â 
a) to tie up the loose ends of the mutineers (since NW normally behead deserters, wouldn't make sense for them to turn a blind eye to the fukrs that killed their LC) and crasters wives (since people have been seeing them for 2.5 seasons now, they would want to know what happened to them when Mance's army attacks)Â 
b ) Â show the extent of Bran's abilities (warging at will, controlling Hodor that much efficiency to be able to make him do something he didnt want to do...something as extreme as murder).
Â 
@Sun..
Â 
i felt it was awesome watching Hodor snap a grown mans neck so effortlessly!
but my pleasure aside, iv seen quite a few posts from people who were extremely disturbed by Hodor's expression after Bran "released" him...they are going as far as saying Bran seems to be developing an evil streak like Arya...i didnt feel it lacked dramatic effect...keep in mind that it was Bran doing the killing, he had no reason to hate/loathe Locke like some of the audience does...plus Bran isnt as accustomed to killing as Arya either....he was just trying to defend himself, makes sense he would do the bare minimum to protect himself. on top of that, showing that he's skilled enough to control Hodor to that extent to rip a man limb from limb might have lead the Unsullied audience to wonder why he even needs to find the 3EC (they wouldn't know that Bran's sole purpose is because he believes he can walk again)
Â 
having said all that, i do believe it was a bit pointless to kill off Locke in that way. Going back to my original point that the purpose of the scene was to show Bran's ability getting more powerful, if Hodor was required to kill someone, perhaps D&D thought it might it more exciting to kill off a known evil character than a random stranger (Rast and Karl were already destined for greater deaths)
Â 
Â 
@DaveyJoe and @Sun...
Â 
I didnt think about that...i was thinking more along the lines that maybe he wanted to enjoy his "hobby" like ramsay and torture him a bit for the fun of it (sadistic psychopath) or perhaps take him back to Roose to prove he's done the job...after all, their fake-deaths were quite convincing, Roose might have asked for actual proof this time (fits his cautious, meticulous nature)

Â 
I don't think anything is unbelievable in the show at this point. I mean, we have Hodor releasing himself... how exactly? He just pulled the chains of the wall, once Bran warged into him?! If that's not lame writing, I don't know what is. And it's just the latest drop in the sea of ridiculous cliches from the show, that goes back to the pilot episode actually ("There is no word for 'thank you' in Dothraki"), and was only growing bigger ever since. There is no logic in show universe. The success of this show basically relies on viewers not thinking too much about what they saw, because in almost every episode there are some illogical outcomes that would prove unsustainable in any believable universe. I'm not talking about surprising outcomes, like the one you mention - electing Jon as The Lord Commander. It's legitimate to find it a stretch. I don't, to be honest, because Jon was always portrayed as a brilliant young man who everybody tries to befriend or recruit. He's, like, the only one Tyrion ever addressed as a friend, right? Again, his appointment as LC is an extraordinary event, and I guess George's aware of it, because, for example, he does make Sam going through the history books to see is Jon the youngest ever. But, it also means GRRM addressed the issue, and went great lengths to explain/justify it. You can still find it unrealistic, but a story as big as ASOIAF is would probably be very shallow without some extraordinary developments that are little stretching.
Â 
On the other hand, the show is simply ridiculous too often. I'm talking TV-invented material. Just look at this sequence at the Craster's. The whole premise is moronic. What, Jon's now playing some intelligence war against Mance? Is that D&D's version of The Cold War?! It's one thing to lie Mance when he asks you a direct question, but it's something completely different to organize a raiding party in order to prevent Mance from finding out some info that he is very likely to find out anyhow. Logically, just going to Craster's to fight mutineers is more potentially more dangerous and damaging than letting them stay there. And then the whole Locke thing. I mean, last season Locke was one of the changes that didn't do any harm. I did miss Vargo and, especially in hindsight, he'd be much better for the show than Locke was, but at least Locke change didn't inflict any damage last season. The actor did a very decent job, his lines were not stupid, and he served a purpose in the story. But this season? Like, what was his mission? What was the order Roose gave him? "Go alone, with nobody else, on your own completely, without any hep whatsoever, and bring me back two Stark boys"? Does it sounds like a sane idea to anyone who thinks about it for a minute? Especially because B&R were discussed by Boltons as a pressing matter.
Â 
And then we have posters here reasoning that the change was needed in order for Jon to built his reputation. Well, the whole reason his reputation is so poor is that D&D destroyed it. And I'm not talking about his in-story reputation, I'm talking his image among viewers. Why would any viewers think Jon is a competent fellow? Did he do anything competent in the show, after Season 1? Not a god damn thing. He's alive by pure fluke, as Tormund explained.
Â 
The whole mess makes no sense at all. And just when I remember those discussions from some two years ago, when show-apologists were parroting that changes were necessary because of time or money or whatever, when it was pretty obvious from the beginning that the most damaging changes were the product of D&D's incompetence. And I really don't see what is the problem with admitting their writing's as incompetent as it gets. Why is it so hard to realize? What is this infatuation with the two of them? Is it because of their constant whining that their job is oh so hard? I don't know, but honestly, I'd advise them to stop bothering any more. Obviously, whatever they do, it's going to be welcomed by show-apologists. If stuff like this, from this season, is welcomed by the audience, everything will be.

And it's just the latest drop in the sea of ridiculous cliches from the show, that goes back to the pilot episode actually ("There is no word for 'thank you' in Dothraki"), and was only growing bigger ever since. There is no logic in show universe. The success of this show basically relies on viewers not thinking too much about what they saw, because in almost every episode there are some illogical outcomes that would prove unsustainable in any believable universe. I'm not talking about surprising outcomes, like the one you mention - electing Jon as The Lord Commander. It's legitimate to find it a stretch. I don't, to be honest, because Jon was always portrayed as a brilliant young man who everybody tries to befriend or recruit. He's, like, the only one Tyrion ever addressed as a friend, right? Again, his appointment as LC is an extraordinary event, and I guess George's aware of it, because, for example, he does make Sam going through the history books to see is Jon the youngest ever. But, it also means GRRM addressed the issue, and went great lengths to explain/justify it. You can still find it unrealistic, but a story as big as ASOIAF is would probably be very shallow without some extraordinary developments that are little stretching.
Â 
On the other hand, the show is simply ridiculous too often. I'm talking TV-invented material. Just look at this sequence at the Craster's. The whole premise is moronic. What, Jon's now playing some intelligence war against Mance? Is that D&D's version of The Cold War?! It's one thing to lie Mance when he asks you a direct question, but it's something completely different to organize a raiding party in order to prevent Mance from finding out some info that he is very likely to find out anyhow. Logically, just going to Craster's to fight mutineers is more potentially more dangerous and damaging than letting them stay there. And then the whole Locke thing. I mean, last season Locke was one of the changes that didn't do any harm. I did miss Vargo and, especially in hindsight, he'd be much better for the show than Locke was, but at least Locke change didn't inflict any damage last season. The actor did a very decent job, his lines were not stupid, and he served a purpose in the story. But this season? Like, what was his mission? What was the order Roose gave him? "Go alone, with nobody else, on your own completely, without any hep whatsoever, and bring me back two Stark boys"? Does it sounds like a sane idea to anyone who thinks about it for a minute? Especially because B&R were discussed by Boltons as a pressing matter.
Â 
And then we have posters here reasoning that the change was needed in order for Jon to built his reputation. Well, the whole reason his reputation is so poor is that D&D destroyed it. And I'm not talking about his in-story reputation, I'm talking his image among viewers. Why would any viewers think Jon is a competent fellow? Did he do anything competent in the show, after Season 1? Not a god damn thing. He's alive by pure fluke, as Tormund explained.
Â 
The whole mess makes no sense at all. And just when I remember those discussions from some two years ago, when show-apologists were parroting that changes were necessary because of time or money or whatever, when it was pretty obvious from the beginning that the most damaging changes were the product of D&D's incompetence. And I really don't see what is the problem with admitting their writing's as incompetent as it gets. Why is it so hard to realize? What is this infatuation with the two of them? Is it because of their constant whining that their job is oh so hard? I don't know, but honestly, I'd advise them to stop bothering any more. Obviously, whatever they do, it's going to be welcomed by show-apologists. If stuff like this, from this season, is welcomed by the audience, everything will be.


The show routinely making weird and inconsistent plot changes for reasons that don't seem to be economical (in which case they'd have been acceptable) has been the case from the start, though. This Craster's keep story is very mild in terms of stupid writing compared to other things they have done. Just take the thing about Lannister gold mines having dried up years ago, for an example from the very same episode. That makes zero sense and also has far greater ramifications for the plot than this, and at least the Craster business was well filmed and acted.Â

That's what I was saying, that D&D were doing it from the get-go. The only thing I'd disagree is that Craster's scene were well filmed and acted. The acting wasn't terrible, but with such lines and actions, it's unrealistic to expect from actors to save the day. I mean, Noah Taylor was usually pretty solid until now, but how is he to act this nonsense in any believable way?! How is Hodor? Meera? Only Karl and Jojen actors were good, because their lines actually did make some sense. As for choreography, I think it was miserable.

Â 
You actually don't see how different book-Jon is from TV-Jon? Those two guys are one and the same to you? Really?
Â 
As for the show trying to set up Jon as a leader, it was the show that missed every single opportunity to portray his competence. In fact, all they did was portraying his incompetence. Why would anyone trust TV-Jon with anything? He's a moron, who wasn't able to do one thing properly for more than two seasons. That being said, D&D can still make him look competent. His biggest battle is yet to come. But, if his competence and confidence and leadership abilities were the reasons behind this deviation, then they failed miserably, and the initial problem was created by themselves in the first place.
Â 
Or, on the other hand, perhaps they didn't fail, because they simply can't. All it takes is for them to whine some more in those behind the scenes videos, and all's good, it seems.

I can't say that you are actually wrong, I guess its just because I have much lower standards for this show than I do the books, since season 2 at the latest. Compared to the average quality level of the show, I think the Craster's keep business holds up very well in terms of entertainment, and is notÂ tooÂ bothersome in terms of plot holes. Compared to the books it is pretty crappy though. Â

3576	Vesemir	2014-05-05	God I think I'm gonna have nightmares from this episode's fight scenes. How the hell did they manage to fight 11 guys for like 10 minutes?? I'm not saying it's not possible when, you know, you actually form some kind of formation, but everyone in this show was fighting DUELS! That doesn't make any sense. And that Jon's bossfight, god. Why did Karl have 2 daggers, when he was using them in the same movements? He could have stabbed Jon like 30 times! This is nonsense.

If he kills Bran he won't find out where Rickon is.


Â 
Locke didn't even ask about Rickon. He didn't even check to see if Rickon was one of the others. He could have at least asked about him.Â So, no, I don't buy the he didn't kill him because he needed to find Rickon excuse.
Even if he somehow knew that Bran and Rickon were seperated, he found out about Bran from snooping on Jon, he should have assumed Jon knew where Rickon was as well.Â 
Â 
Â

@Sun..
Â 
i felt it was awesome watching Hodor snap a grown mans neck so effortlessly!
but my pleasure aside, iv seen quite a few posts from people who were extremely disturbed by Hodor's expression after Bran "released" him...they are going as far as saying Bran seems to be developing an evil streak like Arya...i didnt feel it lacked dramatic effect...keep in mind that it was Bran doing the killing, he had no reason to hate/loathe Locke like some of the audience does...plus Bran isnt as accustomed to killing as Arya either....he was just trying to defend himself, makes sense he would do the bare minimum to protect himself. on top of that, showing that he's skilled enough to control Hodor to that extent to rip a man limb from limb might have lead the Unsullied audience to wonder why he even needs to find the 3EC (they wouldn't know that Bran's sole purpose is because he believes he can walk again)
Â 
having said all that, i do believe it was a bit pointless to kill off Locke in that way. Going back to my original point that the purpose of the scene was to show Bran's ability getting more powerful, if Hodor was required to kill someone, perhaps D&D thought it might it more exciting to kill off a known evil character than a random stranger (Rast and Karl were already destined for greater deaths)
Â 
Â 
@DaveyJoe and @Sun...
Â 
I didnt think about that...i was thinking more along the lines that maybe he wanted to enjoy his "hobby" like ramsay and torture him a bit for the fun of it (sadistic psychopath) or perhaps take him back to Roose to prove he's done the job...after all, their fake-deaths were quite convincing, Roose might have asked for actual proof this time (fits his cautious, meticulous nature)


Â 
Â 
They could have set it up so that Bran kills anyone of the mutineers to escape, it really didn't have to be Locke. As the existing dramatic effect of killing Locke, there's none with relation to Bran. He was defending himself, and he has no concept of Hodor's physical strength and what it can do to a man. So, no. It doesn't have the dark resonance of Arya's killings. It doesn't change Bran tonally. It was completely justified.
Â 
Now, have Bran warg Hodor for, essentially, kicks, like he does in the book, and you have a grey and somewhat disturbing Bran.Â 
Â 
The more I think about it the more I'm convinced that the Locke at the Wall story thread was a case of poor, badly thought out, writing for the sake of time wastage. It is a real shame, Noah is a very fine actor, the thread could have born real interesting narrative fruit.Â

3579	allie4645	2014-05-05	I didn't mind the filler objectively since it did do some constructive things, I am just not entirely on board with how it was all handled. For instance, why would Karl, who is by all accounts a seasoned fighter, turn his back ON A MAN WITH A SWORD to slowly advance on an unarmed woman who he can easily kill after THE MAN WITH THE SWORD is finished off? I know he was inebriated, but come on now. How many people are actually stupid enough to behave this way mid-battle? IMO, all the super evil villains at super evil Craster's Keep who did some super evil things like rape all day every day and chain up some beloved pets and drink out of skulls (that's the worst thing I've ever seen on this show, no one will ever convince me otherwise) and torture children and the mentally handicapped were about as cartoonish as it gets. I think the directors spent too much time making sure the audience knew these guys were suuuuuuuuper eeeeeeeeevil instead of doing something more constructive. I don't understand the point of putting so much focus on guys who are just going to be dead in about 30 minutes rather than fleshing out characters who will be sticking around for a bit longer. This was a debate last week, on how Dany's story arc in Slaver's Bay was being handled, in which the actual violence of her take-over was severely diminished and glossed over. So, if D&D had to tone down SB for production and budgeting reasons, why did they have the time and money for this? There was much more that could have been done in Meereen and CK could have been taken care of in a couple of scenes rather than dragging out over the time span of nearly an entire episode. It could have been quick and efficient to establish Jon's leadership skills, reunite him and Ghost, and still maybe explore the extent of Jojen's abilities. I'm being overly critical, I know, but I think a lot of this was ultimately detrimental to other arcs in the show.Â 
Â 
Also, why didn't the women inform Jon that, "Hey, there are some kids chained up in there. Let's get them out so they don't burn to death."? It would have been a great realization for Jon to understand how close he was to seeing Bran again, but missed him by moments. Jon wouldn't have to go after him; he really couldn't, being wounded and having duties as a member of the NW, but it would have been an emotionally impactful moment and tied up his thoughts about Bran being there. Or he could at least have asked the women if they had seen a crippled boy and a giant anywhere in the area, seeing as he was obviously concerned in the episode before.Â 
Â 
Why have this plot line for Bran, but not introduce Coldhands as a guide, or talk about tKotLT? These could both still happen, sure, but there's still a lot of Bran's plot that hasn't been covered. Bran's arc isn't action- packed, but it has major implications for the rest of the series, and if they haven't introduced these things, why add filler now? I assumed they would have Bran be absent for a couple of episodes here and there, the way they do with most characters, and would have a more detailed, in-depth exploration of his powers, his training, the CotF, BR, the North, etc. And this filler did that to an extent, especially the moral crisis with warging humans, which I was more than pleased with, I'm just concerned with how the book plot seems to be pushed to the background in favor of "exciting" scenes instead of impactful ones.Â 
Â 
And I know this isn't necessarily pertaining to the OP, but I'm also confused about Arya's apparent lack of depression following the RW. She was in part a witness to the slaughter of her family, the North, and her hopes for the future. And she doesn't seem to be emotionally strained in the least. She's vengeful... and that's about it. I don't understand this, and I understand her lack of bitterness towards Sandor in not trying to save Cat and Robb even less. Also, I must have forgotten, but why has she added Beric and Thoros to her kill list? What did they do to her, other than plan to ransom her to her family, which is exactly where she was planning to go anyway? From what I remember, she got on with them fairly well.Â 
Â 
And was it just me, or did anyone else assume that Locke was going to take the place of Bowen Marsh in another stabby adventure? It was actually a shock to me that he was killed, since I figured they were going to use him further. Now I'm completely lost as to what his point was, other than to have a place in this specific, super short arc. In all, I didn't mind the filler per se, I just wish it could have been introduced and cleaned up with a bit more finesse. It did some important things, but I don't understand how this was time or cost effective in any way, and I don't understand how they managed to fit all this in but couldn't be bothered to flesh out major things such as Dany's attack on Meereen. It was entertaining to watch, and I enjoyed that aspect, but GOT could transcend simple entertainment and explore some major issues such as the morality of conquest and the problems involved with one culture dominating and imposing upon a pre-existing one, but this has been barely touched upon.Â

I respect that. I'm not trying to preach how is a TV show to be watched and why is a TV show to be enjoyed. One can like the show for any number of reasons. Your reasons for liking it are not a bit less legitimate than my reasons for disliking it. In one of this threads, I even read a post that says the show is actually better than the books. and you know what: I respect that opinion, too. It is the complete opposite of what I think about the show, but it's an honest opinion at least. It's something I can debate against. But, how's one to debate against people claiming D&D had some logistic reasons to make up Talisa storyline?
3581	Runaway Penguin	2014-05-05	Speculation here...
Â 
The burning of Craster's keep will have deeper impact.
Â 
Mance set "the biggest fire North has seen" as signal for coordinated attack.
Now there is fire, roughly in the path of Wildling army. If Tormund sees it (and he is expected to by the logic of the show)... Opens door to first Wildling attack on the Wall.
Â 
Now obviously most of NW need to get out - probably some dickish move by Thorne, leaving Jon behind as unreliable... Voila, we can jump to books again.

You bring up a good point about the giant Craster's Keep bonfire which is directly in the path of the wildling army marching towards the wall ... hence why they needed to clear out those mutineers in the first place before Mance got ahold of them. So is the Wildling army close enough to see this giant fire? Craster's Keep is supposedly about 50-60 miles from the wall but we don't know how far out the Wildling army is at this point.Â

Coldhands would have been an even bigger waste. Having Jon and his men tidy things up closes that arc, imo.

Keeping Locke there would have ruined the surprise completely.

3584	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-05	It was filler, but it was relatively decent filler
Â 
And let's be honest here, people. Bran's storyline is a drag and it needed some kind of filler
Â 
And something else: it's not as if the books are exempted of filler as well. What are Sam's and Brienne's chapters in Feast, I ask you, if not filler meant to increase the page count and stall those two characters' arcs until they reached their intended destinations.
Â 
Hell, Brienne's fight with the Mummers, both at the Whispers and at the Inn was not unlike this episode (they even took Biter's death and gave it to Karl!)
Â 
Now, don't get me wrong. I didn't love the thing. I didn't like how Locke pretty much fizzled and died anticlimatically, and I was hoping against hope that Coldhands or even a generic Wight/Other was going to show up and kill the mutineers. That would have been more "true" to canon, it would have moved the plot forward by introducing Coldhands, and it wouldn't have felt out of place taking into account last week's ending with the Others
3585	Starksmustwin	2014-05-05	So, it's 'illogical' when the show tries to set up Jon as a leader by giving him a trial to prove his innocence, then having him lead a mission to kill mutineers who could give valuable information to the enemy.
But it's 'surprising' when the book has Jon left in charge of the Wall's defense after arriving back injured after having just been with the enemy for weeks; then several coincidences save his life when his superiors try to execute him; and then is suddenly elected Lord Commander because a raven flies out of a kettle and says his name?
Your argument is flawless.


Â 
Â 
Quoting because it owned the book purists!!
3586	Miodrag	2014-05-05	You manage to write a lot of words without actually saying anything.

Answer me why that is more 'logical' than giving Jon a trial and a mission to prove not only his innocence, but his leadership qualities. Are talking ravens that persuasive?


Â 
Look, if you don't find Jon's book story believable, how can I persuade you it is? Why would I even try? I can only repeat it was written as a borderline case in terms of believability, which is why the author did bother do write the scene with Sam checking history books, most probably. As for a comparison between that and the last episode, I think it's pretty obvious which is more believable of the two. Elections, in both our world and Martin's universe, are seldom logical, and they're known to be influenced by manipulations of all kinds all he time. Doesn't mean every manipulation is necessarily believable, but in the book we at least witness the entire manipulation, so we can decide for ourselves. Charging a camp with all guns blazing is just a stupid tactics, in whatever universe. It's not one possible outcome out of three. It's just stupid. Believing Locke that hounds are in a cabin and the cabin is therefore to be avoided is stupid. Hey, it's moronic even. Mutineers have hounds, and they keep them in a cabin?! Where did they get the hounds? It's lame writing. Simple as that. It's not the matter of odds or believability. TV Jon is a moron.
Â 
But OK, let's speculate a little. Let's say that both events, Jon's appointment and TV Craster's fighting, are equally problematic. Is the show going to lose the former? Of course it isn't. Jon is going to be chosen as the LC in the show as well. So, instead of dealing with one unbelievable event in Jon's arc, the show added one more. How is that a good thing?!
Â 
And, by the way, it wasn't just talking ravens in the books. Jon did prove himself in the battle. And he was judged from the very start as a leader material, by both Aemon and Jeor (and by Qhorin, but only we readers know that). The two biggest authorities were grooming Jon for commander, and the entire NW knew that. Granted, Sam says it in the show, too, in season one, but alas, the show pretty successfully ruined Jon's reputation afterwards, so Sam's words have very little meaning in the show universe.
3587	Uldra I	2014-05-05	NaarioDaharis (OP),
Â 
Unfortunately, this was not a filler. Behindâ<U+0080><U+0099>s D&Dâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ridiculous â<U+0080><U+009C>creativityâ<U+0080><U+009D> there is always a system, there is always some reasoning no competent writer would ever think of. Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the worst part in their incompetence. And, all this Northern mess was because of a â<U+0080><U+009C>butterfly effectâ<U+0080><U+009D>.
Â 
Now, many show-apologists hate the term, because it brings back the whole concept of context, which, actually, can produce a number of problems for incompetent writers like D&D, but the context does play a role in sagas like this one. You see, Jon indeed has to be established as a leader. And, in the books, Martin managed that. How? Well, by efficiently using Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s chapters. For example, in book two we saw how respected Jon was by one of the most respected fighters and leaders in the realm â<U+0080><U+0093> Qhorin Halfhand. After those chapters, readers practically donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t need to be persuaded any more Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a leader material. That Jon was trusted by Aemon and Jeor, too, also helped. Opposite to that, in the TV show we had this:
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re even dumber than you look.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
That is what Qhorin says to Jon in their first proper conversation, after he tastes Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s manners and maturity for the first time. Funny enough, that was their last proper conversation as well â<U+0080><U+0093> soon after, they got separated (again, because of Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pure incompetence), and when theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re reunited episodes later, theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re both captured by the wildlings and Qhorinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s even more angry at Jon, just as anyone would be, considering Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s stupidity was the reason the mission went so wrong. Not to mention that TV Aemon never expressed any praise about Jon, while TV Jeor kinda liked the lad, but thought very little of him. So, basically, out of three main authority figures Jon encounters after joining NW, none was trilled with Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s abilities nor potentials, and one was openly furious at him.
Â 
Then, in season 3, weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re witnessing Jon constantly being humiliated by Ygritte, who in the show is a girl of impeccable wisdom, able to outsmart and/or ridicule Jon on any topic they happen to discuss. While she possibly doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think Jon is â<U+0080><U+009C>even dumber than he looksâ<U+0080><U+009D>, Ygritte exposed any number of holes in Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s attitude toward life and his views on the world, and, letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not forget, she was so superior to him she actually spared his life, as Tormund explained at the beginning of the season 4.
Â 
Hence, the writers really had to establish Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s competence somehow, in order for him to be any believable as the lord commander at the end of the season. After effectively destroying his competence for three previous seasons, they simply had to show heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not an idiot. The butterfly effect. Of course, I agree with you completely that the way they did it was embarrassing to watch. As Cas Stark said, it all looked like a slasher flick. And a very cheap one, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d add.
Â 
Naturally, D&D are so incompetent, eventually they didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t establish anything at all. Even a half drunk low-life like Karl would easily kill Jon, if not for a convenient plot-devise in the form of Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s forgotten wife/daughter. Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s crew was unable to take 11 renegades by surprise in the middle of the night. Jon was played like a violin by some Locke guy who, letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s face it, wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t exactly a genius. And on top of everything, if not for Branâ<U+0080><U+0099>s warging, Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s stupidity would actually enable the very same Lock to capture Bran. So no, D&Dâ<U+0080><U+0099>s plan didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t work. But, the good news for them is that it doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t matter. In fact, they didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t even need to bother. They couldâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve easily put a proper filler in these two episodes. You know, some brothels, and whores, and more whores, and some prostitutes at the end. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not like somebody would mind. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not like somebodyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going to question Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s leadership abilities at the end of the season. Actually, Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s eventual competence could very well be the twist of this season. The audience, judging by the enthusiasm among show-apologists here, is not going to have a problem with it at all. If D&D manage to stay away from non-consensual sex and wolf-slaying in the future, their show is going to be hailed as a brilliant piece of television and a faithful adaptation that, occasionally, even manages to surpass its source material â<U+0080><U+0093> whatever that may be (my money would be on some cross between True Blood and Sex and the City).


Â 
Yeah, and Nobody seems to mind that this is not the story that GRRM tells either.Â  I guess as long as you have tits and ass and blood, D&D can feel free to butcher a man's lifetime achievement with abandon.Â  Sheesh...Â  *shaking head in disbelief*Â ...Â  Nobody even cares.Â

3588	Quentyn Kartell	2014-05-05	I dont think it was important enough... story wise... for Jon Snow to go to Craster's keep. Those mutineers were long forgotten about. They didnt even have a big part in the book.
Â 
One thing I didn't understand is why would Locke at the Wall. If Jon Snow had no idea that Bran was in Craster's Keep, how did Locke know to look for them there? Did I miss something?
3589	WildBlood	2014-05-05	My problem with the filler from this episode is this: The Wildlings and The Magnar sent the little NOrthern kid running to the wall saying they were on the way... The little kid got there lickity split and the NW Crew & Jon directly head north to Craster. Where the HELL are those wildlings and why are they taking soooo much longer then the little 6 year old they sent running?

Â 
One presumes they are still raiding villages and causing mayhem as directed. The little kid gets there straight away as expected but the rest of the wildlings are busy raiding on one side, and advancing a massive 100k army complete with entire families / tribes, animals, mammoths, giants, etc etc... it's slow moving. The Night's Watch did get to Craster's awfully fast but there again you've got the magical television portal device going on.

It's more like "Not very one agrees". Â  And besides that, a lot of people realize that this is the same basic story being told two completely different ways. Â  Martin even said himself that "I have my version and they have theirs" when asked if the show would influence his writing. Â Unlike a lot of people here, he knows the difference.

Â

Â 
Â 
Is it legitimate to compare? Â Sure. Â But to completely damn the TV version because it doesn't have countless ways to tell it's story (exposition, for instance) like the books do? Â  Nope. Â That's not legitimate at all. Â  To prefer one over the other? Â Absolutely. Â Have at it. Â I personally prefer the books as well. Â And as to your last point, it's simply not possible with the limitations of TV. Â In the books, we get chapter after chapter inside of Jon's head. Â  We know exactly how he feels about everything. Â  In the show, we get 10 minutes every other week and the only things we know for sure is what we can see him do and hear him say. Â So again, it's impossible to know TV Jon the way we know book Jon. Â So, changes need to be made. Â D & D can't focus on book readers. Â They have to make sure fans that don't know the story understand it. Â Which is why they try to show Jon taking a leading role and then being heroic. Â 
Â 
On top of that, they have to take into account fan favorites. Â  The Hound, Bronn, Pod, etc are getting more time because people enjoy seeing them. Â  So, again, more deviations are required to accommodate them. Â  Plus, having a million different characters, like so many other things they have to cut, simply wouldn't work for a 10 hour per season TV series.
Â 
As long as the over all arcs stay the same, then I'll be happy. Â So far, they haven't left out anything big and at the same time, they've spruced up certain things that wouldn't have translated well to TV. Â  It's not perfect. Â But it definitely works and other than a few people on this board who never seem happy with anything, most people I've spoken with believe this show is one of the best on TV. Â  I agree with those people. Â It's a very fun and entertaining show.Â

3595	Fat Trell	2014-05-05	The problem with this scene is not that it is filler. The problem is that it isn't particularly well-thought out or relevant filler.
Â 
If the goal here is to kill time, what is the point of introducing an entire new plot thread onlyÂ to end it in 2 episodes?
Â 
What is the point of having your Vargo Hoat stand-in, who you gave the interesting assignment of tracking down the remaining Starks, die during his first conflict?
Â 
Building Jon's competence up is a decent enough motive. A motive which wouldn't exist if the show had not done everything to detract from Jon's ability and esteem in the eyes of his superiors forÂ 3 and 1/4 seasons.Â ThisÂ problem is a nonstarterÂ as well when one considers Jon is about to have a very prominent moment of glory in a few weeks. Why do we need to hammer this home anymore?Â 
Â 
There was much more mileage in Locke's story imo. Less soÂ with the mutineers but that might be the gratuitous rape clouding my judgment.

3596	sj4iy	2014-05-05	Look, if you don't find Jon's book story believable, how can I persuade you it is? Why would I even try?Because you seem to be trying to convince people that the book is better than the episode because it is more believable. That's why I said "prove your argument". It's the basis for debate.I can only repeat it was written as a borderline case in terms of believability, which is why the author did bother do write the scene with Sam checking history books, most probably. As for a comparison between that and the last episode, I think it's pretty obvious which is more believable of the two. Elections, in both our world and Martin's universe, are seldom logical, and they're known to be influenced by manipulations of all kinds all he time. Doesn't mean every manipulation is necessarily believable, but in the book we at least witness the entire manipulation, so we can decide for ourselves. Charging a camp with all guns blazing is just a stupid tactics, in whatever universe. It's not one possible outcome out of three. It's just stupid. Believing Locke that hounds are in a cabin and the cabin is therefore to be avoided is stupid. Hey, it's moronic even. Mutineers have hounds, and they keep them in a cabin?! Where did they get the hounds? It's lame writing. Simple as that. It's not the matter of odds or believability. TV Jon is a moron.Sam made it so that Jon was 'put on the ballot', so to speak. Still isn't very believable that Jon would win the popular vote when many people still believe him to be a turncloack (as we see in ADWD later on). Of course the mutineers don't have any hounds...but Craster could have- he had plenty of other animals like sheep, rabbits and pigs- why are dogs so 'ridiculous'?And name-calling (Jon is a moron) is pretty pointless when you can't seem to back up the reason why you think he is.Â But OK, let's speculate a little. Let's say that both events, Jon's appointment and TV Craster's fighting, are equally problematic. Is the show going to lose the former? Of course it isn't. Jon is going to be chosen as the LC in the show as well. So, instead of dealing with one unbelievable event in Jon's arc, the show added one more. How is that a good thing?!No, the show didn't. They changed the timing, they added the trial, and then added scenes where Jon proves his leadership skills- helping the men in the training yard, warning them of the danger the mutineers pose, asking the men for volunteers and then finally having him lead those men to kill the mutineers. None of that was in the books, and it expands Jon's character in a way that didn't happen in the books before he was elected LC. And show Jon still has more opportunities to prove his abilities in the fight ahead. You've yet to back up your assertion as to why any of that is "unbelievable".Â And, by the way, it wasn't just talking ravens in the books. Jon did prove himself in the battle. And he was judged from the very start as a leader material, by both Aemon and Jeor (and by Qhorin, but only we readers know that). The two biggest authorities were grooming Jon for commander, and the entire NW knew that. Granted, Sam says it in the show, too, in season one, but alas, the show pretty successfully ruined Jon's reputation afterwards, so Sam's words have very little meaning in the show universe.Jon proved himself in battle to less than 30-40 men who were left at Castle Black while the rest were out fighting the Wildling feints. When those other men came back, several of the men he 'proved' himself to were dead, and Jon was thrown into the ice cells to die. He was only taken out when Aemon insisted, and then given a suicide mission as a way to prove his 'innocence'...which ends up miraculously interrupted when Stannis' men sweep in and defeat Mance Rayder's forces. Jon is never given a trial, and many of the men believe he's a traitor. It was pretty unbelievable that the men would choose to elect Jon over more experienced men like Cotter Pyke when there were still lingering questions about his loyalty. The show has resolved that issue by giving Jon many other opportunities to prove himself before the big battle comes.

crasters keep is supposed to be 60 miles from Wall...and Tormund and others are even further south than that (or is it East?) ...i doubt Crasters keep is big enough to count as "the biggest fire the North has ever seen!!" Mance's one should be on a MUCH MUCH larger scale...the flames and smoke should rise significantly higher than 700 ft!! cant wait to see itÂ

3606	Miodrag	2014-05-05	Is it legitimate to compare? Â Sure. Â But to completely damn the TV version because it doesn't have countless ways to tell it's story (exposition, for instance) like the books do? Â  Nope. Â That's not legitimate at all.

Â They have to make sure fans that don't know the story understand it. Â Which is why they try to show Jon taking a leading role and then being heroic.


Â 
So, where do changes to Jon's season 2 and season 3 arcs belong? How did his flirting with Ygritte help? How did the omission of his learning from Qhorin help? How did Ygritte ridiculing him all the time help? How did Ygritte saving his life - while hitting him with three arrows - help?
Â 


On top of that, they have to take into account fan favorites. Â  The Hound, Bronn, Pod, etc are getting more time because people enjoy seeing them. Â  So, again, more deviations are required to accommodate them. Â  Plus, having a million different characters, like so many other things they have to cut, simply wouldn't work for a 10 hour per season TV series.

Â  I agree with those people. Â It's a very fun and entertaining show.Â 


Â 
But, why is it OK to take into account fan favorites from the show, while it's disregarding so many fan favorites from the books? Don't get me wrong, they have the right to give as much screen time to any character as they want. HBO payed for their right to do that. But, fan favorites from the books were cut - Strong Belwas definitely, Vargo definitely, Coldhands probably - only for some new fan favorites to be given more screen time? Not to mention how odd is the whole concept of "fan favorites" and catering to that concept.
Â 
And, speaking of Sandor, how is his TV character even comparable to his book counterpart? Practically, is there a Sandor line from the books they kept in the show (other than lines they gave to Littlefinger, and those few remarks around his combat with Beric)? Just reread any of chapters with Sandor, especially his ASOS stuff, and you'll see what brilliant material was entirely omitted, and replaced for what? Why is Sandor teaching Arya anything at all? Isn't he the cruel pragmatist? Doesn't he think Arya's going to die anyway? Why does he tutor her at all? Isn't Arya only a money to him? I mean, that's how he's portrayed in the show - a cruel, merciless, pragmatist, that has no reason whatsoever to question his cynical worldviews: so why does he even care about Arya at all, then?
Â 
And, once more, I'm not denying the show is fun and entertaining to many people. I respect that. But, debates like this, in a site like this, should go beyond that, I think.
3607	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-05	Â 
The mental gymnastics around here are entertaining.Â  People tend to make excuses for elements in the book that they would ridicule if they were show inventions.


Â 
Oh, definetely. Brienne's chapters in Feast are described (I'm not making this up) as "a profound and existentialist look at the effects of war in the common people, as well as clever world-building" while every bit of a deviation in the show is "OMG, nonsense, plot holes galore, someone kill these hacks already!"
Â 
I mean, it's obviously ok to prefer one medium to another. Personally, I like the books much more and, I admit it, I can be a bit of a purist as well. But how on earth do you expect to evaluate the differences objectively if you don't accept the books' criticisms and pretty much believe the books are perfect and impossible to improve, as people here seem to think?

3608	allie4645	2014-05-05	By that logic, the show nor the books should have emphasized Ned Stark, since he was going to be dead before the end of the first book. You might as well argue that paying Sean Bean whatever they paid him was pointless, because he just died. The screenwriters know better what they are doing than we do, so it's up to them to make those decisions.
Â 
Â 
Pretty clear that they had checked all of the tents already before it even got to that point. And keep in mind, these ladies don't trust them anymore than they trusted the other Crows.
Â 
Because it seems that Coldhands was an unnecessary character that didn't contribute to the plot and could have confused a lot of people - didn't you just argue that this whole scene was a waste of time and money? Coldhands would have been an even bigger waste. Having Jon and his men tidy things up closes that arc, imo. And the show needs all of the excitement it can get with the books that it's about to adapt.
Â 
Why would Arya be depressed? Not everyone gets 'depressed' when a loved one dies. Some hold the grief in, others get angry. Arya is angry.
Â 
Nope, I never did assume that. Why? Because then the viewers would see the betrayal coming from a mile off, and that scene is all about the surprise of it. Keeping Locke there would have ruined the surprise completely.


Except that Ned had an impact on the story. He had an arc, development, and his story ultimately set up several main arcs in the series. The villains at CK did none of that. They were bad guys everyone, including the show-only watchers, knew would be taken out. There's no way either of Bran's or Jon's story arcs were set up to end there because it wouldn't make any sense. I'm not saying that characters with build-up can't die, I'm just saying that their deaths can't be meaningless and I think it was pretty obvious two main characters wouldn't die in the middle of nowhere with no impact whatsoever. So why spend so much screen time on the mutineers raping and rambling while drinking out of skulls instead of showing something a bit more pertinent to the over-all plot? I understand that the show writers know what's going to happen in the long-term and that they know what goes into making a show, but I'm also not going to pretend that gives them a free pass to do whatever with no criticism at all. I personally think that CK could have been edited down more effectively and still have had the same impact as far as character development.Â 
Â 
I didn't realize that they checked all the huts already, but I guess that makes sense seeing as they were laying out the bodies. Also, even if Craster's wives didn't fully trust Jon, why does that keep him from asking? It's not a major issue or anything, I'm just confused about why that point was left open-ended seeing as there was some build up to it in the previous episode and it seems that closure of it in the future, if there is any at all, will be somewhat awkward since it wasn't handled immediately.Â 
Â 
And Coldhands does contribute to the plot. He leads them to BR. Bran knows he has to go North, but how does he know where exactly to go? Is he supposed to search the entire stretch of land north of the Wall until he happens to run into the specific weirwood he's looking for? I don't see how introducing one character to clean up CK and guide Bran to where he needs to get is an even bigger waste than what we've seen these past two episodes. I still think they will need to introduce CH because how are a crippled boy, a mentally handicapped man, and two teenagers, one of whom is extremely ill, supposed to get safely where they need to be (through WW, wights, wildlings, etc) without help and without a map? Also, maybe I didn't communicate this effectively, but I don't have a problem with Jon being the one to take out the mutineers. It was necessary to establish Jon as a potential leader in the future. I just think there was so much time spent on it when it could have been handled more cleanly to maintain the bulk of other relevant plot lines.Â 
Â 
And here's my problem with Arya: she just gets vengeful, but still maintains a positive attitude, which is what we've already seen from her a million times. It's even stranger because the deaths of Cat and Robb are NOT the same as the deaths of Yoren or Lommy or Mycah. How is it possible that she's suffered the worst losses of her life, but has not changed or developed since the beginning of S2? It's understandable that she's angry, but every hope that she was clinging to since Ned died were crushed, and all we get from her is a few names added to her hit list? It makes her kind of needlessly one-dimensional, IMO. (And I'm still legitimately curious about why she wants to kill Beric and Thoros. I've clearly forgotten something.)
Â 
And if Locke weren't going to stick around, why was he there? Just to serve in this teeny tiny arc that lasted 2 episodes? I assumed that he would serve a greater purpose in the arc on the Wall. I liked him and wanted to see more of him, and assumed his antics would somehow further the plot. So I was just kind of disappointed and had kind of a "Huh. That's all?" moment when he died. Obviously that's just a personal preference but there was just something kind of meh and anticlimactic about Locke's death.Â

i've chosen to see it as D&D's attempt to pull a GRRM! and didnt quite manage to pull it off wellÂ Â

I remember thinking along those very lines regarding both Oberyn (at least he didnt get a POV) and Quentyn as well....

Â 
why do you want absolutely everything in a tv show to relate to main story arcs? and have you ever considered that maybe they will have significance in later episodes?
3612	Widows_Blood	2014-05-05	Â 
I hope you realize it's legitimate to compare the two versions. I hope you realize it's legitimate to prefer the books. I hope you realize it's legitimate to think the show would be much better had HBO stuck more closely to the books.
Â 
There, you see: one can clearly know the difference and still dislike the numerous faults of the show.


I'm sure you will agree with this line of reason if the show depicted multiple seasons of brienne looking for a maid of four and ten with auburn hair, Jon counting fish, Tyrion admiring turtles, Dany fingering herself for two seasons. Or how about Quentyn? The wonderful POV that dies anti-climatically, rendering all those chapters of his useless. An entire season of Jaime diddling around the Riverlands, an entire season of Cersei going insane.
Â 
The books have plenty of filler, pointless characters, other memorable characters that disappear into irrelevance; yet for whatever reason, the show is always had to a different standard. Maybe the show wouldn't have to change so much if George kept his books to a manageable character list. Maybe the show wouldn't have to change so much if characters like Stannis weren't sitting around doing nothing for 90 percent of the book. Or if Bran was given more than a couple of chapters in the span of around 1800 pages. But i'll leave you to continue worshiping at the altar of GRRM. Â Â
3613	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-05-05	Â 
Oh, definetely. Brienne's chapters in Feast are described (I'm not making this up) as "a profound and existentialist look at the effects of war in the common people, as well as clever world-building" while every bit of a deviation in the show is "OMG, nonsense, plot holes galore, someone kill these hacks already!"
Â 
I mean, it's obviously ok to prefer one medium to another. Personally, I like the books much more and, I admit it, I can be a bit of a purist as well. But how on earth do you expect to evaluate the differences objectively if you don't accept the books' criticisms and pretty much believe the books are perfect and impossible to improve, as people here seem to think?


Â 
You have to be kind of crazy to like the show better than the books, but the amount of hypocrisy and mindless complaining is just absurd considering most of the members here are quite intelligent.Â
3614	Cas Stark	2014-05-05	I'm sure you will agree with this line of reason if the show depicted multiple seasons of brienne looking for a maid of four and ten with auburn hair, Jon counting fish, Tyrion admiring turtles, Dany fingering herself for two seasons.

Bad changes are bad. Â The fact that the last two books are chock full of filler doesn't make a bad HBO change into a good one. Â
3615	gash	2014-05-05	AFFC was a pretty weak and dull book. most will agree with that. it's hardly a stretch to suggest the tv show could make dramatic improvements.
3616	SkaggCannibal	2014-05-05	Can we all take a minute to think about how stupid Locke was? Was he going to drag Bran all the way back to the Wall, and then what? Climb over it? Go to Castle Black with the Stark heir as a captive? It is completely impossible to do that succesfully, Bran is a cripple, you have to carry him all the way back while Jon and co will be hunting you because you were stupid enough to let the other captives live. Maybe he was going to kill Bran just outside the camp, but that is still so stupid because he let the others live. All he should have done is kill all four of the captives and run for the hills. But then again he already took an oath so he was gonna be hunted for as a desserter anyway. Ugh, so stupid.
Â 
And those women, what is their plan??? Going their own way, in the freezing cold, with ice zombies, no food... That's stupidity on the same level as Locke. But at least they will die pretty quick in the cold and we will never have to see them again.
Â 
Best thing about the whole Craster's storyline was seeing Craster's Keep burn. At least this was the end and we will never ever have another boring, illogical Craster-centered storyline again. Yes I smiled when I saw it burning, a relief.
Â 
Â 


You're asking why? The answer is simple. If they wouldn't have done it then Jon, Bran and the rest would have absolutely no screen time for almost the entire season, they didn't want to rush the story too much so they invented those scenes, simple.


If only. Bran's story is an incredibly boring one, let's not flesh it out. Same for Jon pre-Stannis.

And you forgot to add "A big ass dire wolf" in your list of Bran's party.Â Â And here's my problem with Arya: she just gets vengeful, but still maintains a positive attitude, which is what we've already seen from her a million times.

I will easily admit that it could have been handled better in that respect. I have no problem with him dying, though. He was never going to become Jon's 'right hand man' anyway, because that would have been too obvious.

why do you want absolutely everything in a tv show to relate to main story arcs? and have you ever considered that maybe they will have significance in later episodes?Â 


When did I say absolutely everything had to? I'm explaining why I thought this was a lot of time to be spent on filler when so much was trimmed down in other aspects of the story. In a show that has so much time and budgeting constraints, why exactly did they make this decision when other things could have been done? It was entertaining, I'm just questioning the long-term ramifications of the choice to include so much extended material. And, maybe I'm being woefully short-sighted, but I don't see how spending so much time establishing the mutineers' jackassery could have significance in later episodes considering how dead they are right now. Jon's leadership, Bran's warging, Jojen's powers: definitely significant, and I'm not trying to say that it wasn't great to see that. Locke and the mutineers and the time spent on them? I don't see the problem in debating their significance.Â
3620	Miodrag	2014-05-05	Because you seem to be trying to convince people that the book is better than the episode because it is more believable. That's why I said "prove your argument". It's the basis for debate.
Sam made it so that Jon was 'put on the ballot', so to speak. Still isn't very believable that Jon would win the popular vote when many people still believe him to be a turncloack (as we see in ADWD later on). Of course the mutineers don't have any hounds...but Craster could have- he had plenty of other animals like sheep, rabbits and pigs- why are dogs so 'ridiculous'?
And name-calling (Jon is a moron) is pretty pointless when you can't seem to back up the reason why you think he is.
No, the show didn't. They changed the timing, they added the trial, and then added scenes where Jon proves his leadership skills- helping the men in the training yard, warning them of the danger the mutineers pose, asking the men for volunteers and then finally having him lead those men to kill the mutineers. None of that was in the books, and it expands Jon's character in a way that didn't happen in the books before he was elected LC. And show Jon still has more opportunities to prove his abilities in the fight ahead. You've yet to back up your assertion as to why any of that is "unbelievable".
Jon proved himself in battle to less than 30-40 men who were left at Castle Black while the rest were out fighting the Wildling feints. When those other men came back, several of the men he 'proved' himself to were dead, and Jon was thrown into the ice cells to die. He was only taken out when Aemon insisted, and then given a suicide mission as a way to prove his 'innocence'...which ends up miraculously interrupted when Stannis' men sweep in and defeat Mance Rayder's forces. Jon is never given a trial, and many of the men believe he's a traitor. It was pretty unbelievable that the men would choose to elect Jon over more experienced men like Cotter Pyke when there were still lingering questions about his loyalty. The show has resolved that issue by giving Jon many other opportunities to prove himself before the big battle comes.


Â 
Of course the book version is more believable, simply by not having ridiculous developments like some Locke guy volunteering for NW. How would that even work, please? His angle I'm interested in. You join the order that is for life, just to get some info, and then run away, knowing it's punishable by death? That makes sense to you? And anyway, how is he to take Bran and Rickon by himself? Where'sLocke's support? As other posters asked: what would he do with Bran? Carry him to The Wall and beyond?
Â 
Craster possibly had hounds, you say. All right, how come Jon doesn't remember that? But, even that aside: why the hell would they avoid hounds, with the tactics they've chosen? They're charging! Chained hounds are of no concern for them. So why would Jon listen Locke about the hounds?
Â 
And how does Jon look trusting Locke? What, TV Jon is just trusting a guy he just met and knows nothing about? And you find it strange I think TV Jon's a moron? And he's a moron because other characters say so. Not in so many words, but "You're even dumber than you look" comes pretty close, don't you think? Not to mention Ygritte constantly besting him in every argument they had.
Â 
All of that didn't happen in the books. You're talking about the problem the show created. In the novels, Jon is trusted and respected from the start. He's hated by some very unpopular guys, like Alliser and Janos, but, prior to ADWD, he's pretty respected by other recruits and later comrades. You're projecting his TV personality into the book story, and you're making it sound like he has some reputation issues in the books. He didn't. Opposite to the show, he was very well respected in the novels. Just recall what Aemon says to him when he handles him The Wall. Just remember Donal, a character that doesn't exist in the show. Isn't he important for Jon's credibility as a character? Of course he is. But, he's omitted from the show, while we have some Karl fellow and his mutiny.
Â 
The show created this problem with Jon's reputation and his competence. And then they tried to solve it. But they failed. Because, Jon looks not a bit more competent than before the last episode. He's as incompetent as he was with Qhorin. In the novels, on the other hand, he's always respected, and he's capable of carrying out the toughest missions, like infiltrating the wildlings - while in the show, he was effectively saved by Ygritte. I mean, in the books, it was he who saved Ygritte, which is why he saved him back the first chance she got. On TV, he didn't save her. She saved herself from him. He refused to kill her, but he didn't let her go. He didn't know what to do with her. And then he lost his brothers by chasing her. And then she lead him into a trap. Practically, she owed him nothing in the show. He didn't earn even her help. Small wonder his competence and respect had to be built from the scratch at this point. Book Jon has no such problems. Other than jerks like Alliser and Janos, brothers usually love and respect Jon, and we can see the reasons why. The show is an entirely different thing in that regard.

3621	Fat Trell	2014-05-05	AFFC was a pretty weak and dull book. most will agree with that. it's hardly a stretch to suggest the tv show could make dramatic improvements.


Â 
This a reach. Many in this fanbase list aFfC as their least favorite book(myself not included). But a quick glance through any thread on ranking the books shows that most found Feast to be very enjoyable, simply not as enjoyable as aSoS, which admittedly overshadows its sequel somewhat.Â 
Â 
ConsideringÂ the vast majority of viewers findÂ the weakest parts of the show to be those created wholesale by D&D(Qarth, Talisa, Stannis' pickled children), I would say its a stretch to say they can be trusted to conjure better television from, from your POV, weaker sourceÂ material.
3622	acosta	2014-05-05	But, why is it OK to take into account fan favorites from the show, while it's disregarding so many fan favorites from the books? Don't get me wrong, they have the right to give as much screen time to any character as they want. HBO payed for their right to do that. But, fan favorites from the books were cut - Strong Belwas definitely, Vargo definitely, Coldhands probably - only for some new fan favorites to be given more screen time?


Those characters would look stupid and cartoonish and break the realism of the show if they actually visually depicted them as described in the books. Let me go ahead and spoil the future for you. They're also going to cut the slave soldiers on stilts and the naked women fighting with snakes wrapped around them.
3623	Miodrag	2014-05-05	I'm sure you will agree with this line of reason if the show depicted multiple seasons of brienne looking for a maid of four and ten with auburn hair, Jon counting fish, Tyrion admiring turtles, Dany fingering herself for two seasons. Or how about Quentyn? The wonderful POV that dies anti-climatically, rendering all those chapters of his useless. An entire season of Jaime diddling around the Riverlands, an entire season of Cersei going insane.
Â 
The books have plenty of filler, pointless characters, other memorable characters that disappear into irrelevance; yet for whatever reason, the show is always had to a different standard. Maybe the show wouldn't have to change so much if George kept his books to a manageable character list. Maybe the show wouldn't have to change so much if characters like Stannis weren't sitting around doing nothing for 90 percent of the book. Or if Bran was given more than a couple of chapters in the span of around 1800 pages. But i'll leave you to continue worshiping at the altar of GRRM. Â Â 


Â 
Of course I think ASOIAF is a masterpiece. Why would I be here otherwise? But, it's not about me worshiping GRRM, it's about show-apologists worshiping D&D and then projecting that on others.
Â 
It can't be that both stories are the one and the same, when they're obviously very different. It can't be that both are equally good. I prefer the novels. And that's an understatement. I really dislike the show. I'm only watching it so that I can analyze the process of adaptation. Because, even a bad example is better than no example, I'm sure you'd agree.
Â 
But it's not just bad as an adaptation, the show is also very bad as a show. And it's not a secret even. I mean, Stephen Dillane doesn't even watch it.

Of course I think ASOIAF is a masterpiece. Why would I be here otherwise? But, it's not about me worshiping GRRM, it's about show-apologists worshiping D&D and then projecting that on others.
Â 
It can't be that both stories are the one and the same, when they're obviously very different. It can't be that both are equally good. I prefer the novels. And that's an understatement. I really dislike the show. I'm only watching it so that I can analyze the process of adaptation. Because, even a bad example is better than no example, I'm sure you'd agree.
Â 
But it's not just bad as an adaptation, the show is also very bad as a show. And it's not a secret even. I mean, Stephen Dillane doesn't even watch it. Ciaran Hinds was almost apologizing for accepting the role of Mance. And I'm willing to bet they're not alone in that attitude among the crew.

Â 
Okay, that's too harsh. Â It is a critical favorite, it is generally recognized for good writing, good acting and being a very ambitious show.
Â 
After last season, I finally recognized D&D for what they are. Â They're good at some things, very good, the casting has generally been impeccable, the acting is generally also very good. Â But, they also totally flake out...like the multiple Daario's, multiple Mountains, etc. Â The writing is good, but VERY inconsistent. Â D&D will always go for the OMG SURPRISE over building suspense, even at the expense of plot, logic and character. Â The show is very random, they spend inexplicably large amounts of time on meaningless BS and short change major characters and storylines. Â Many of the D&D changes definitely have the 'butterfly' effect and they have more than once written themselves into a plot corner. Â Some of the changes are impossible to understand, such as Shae being a goody goody D&D are talented but flawed.
Â 
The Craster's Keep story is a case in point. Â It mind bogglingly managed to be too long and too rushed at the same time. Â The Locke plot is totally stupid and illogical, and they gave a very good character a lame death.
Â 
They spent most of the screen time showing us that they were very, very bad men. Â Who cares? They could have used that time to do something more substantial...surely there was some more pertinent dialogue than 'fuck them til their dead' that could have been created.
Â 
Same with Bran. Â Okay, I get it, his story doesn't translate that well to TV so they wanted to have something happen. Â But, really, it was lame. Â Nobody talks to the captives, it's not even clear what they plan to do...kill them or ransom them. Â Ands, another near miss...but Bran's decision was super rushed...
Â 
Not a bad idea but poorly executed.

3625	Gus Petch	2014-05-05	Jon's and Bran's story arcs were both dragging.Â  I suppose HBO wanted to spice it up a little bit with some swashbuckling sword fights.Â Â  Yeah, it was filler.Â  On one hand, would you rather hear more of Sam whining about molestown and Jon being all depressing and gloomy?Â
3626	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-05	Those characters would look stupid and cartoonish and break the realism of the show if they actually visually depicted them as described in the books. Let me go ahead and spoil the future for you. They're also going to cut the slave soldiers on stilts and the naked women fighting with snakes wrapped around them.


Â 
Agree. Strong Belwas is a ridiculous orientalist cartoon (and pretty unfunny at that). Vargo's lisp got old after a few pages (Locke was such an improvement), and yet people eat that shit up just because they're book characters. But the show introduces an over-the-top cannibal Magnar and the world ends. The double standards are just incredible
Â 
I do think that the show has toned down some colorful characters I like from the books, though, Mance and Tormund being the most noteworthy examples
Â

Â 
See? I just can't with this hyperbole. I don't know how anyone expects objectivity from a person who considers the books a masterpiece and apparently flawless and impervious to any criticism whatsoever. This is the definition of bias and overreaction.Â 
Â 
Now, don't get me wrong. I'm liking the show less and less with every episode, almost to the point that I'm practically hate-watching just to nitpick. But there are ways to criticize objectively and then there's this kind of hateful vitriol that frankly doesn't contribute to the discussion
3627	Dudu42	2014-05-05	Â 
Most viewers think Bran's story is boring


Always bugged me.
Â 
I find the Bran's story one of the most curious one, delving in the super crazy and cool mythologies beyond the wall. Much more interesting than the more popular arcs, like Daenerys and KL. In fact, Bran and Arya arcs are the ones I'm following with most curiosity, followed closely by Jon.
3628	Yelloweyedemon	2014-05-05	Â 
Yeah, and Nobody seems to mind that this is not the story that GRRM tells either.Â  I guess as long as you have tits and ass and blood, D&D can feel free to butcher a man's lifetime achievement with abandon.Â  Sheesh...Â  *shaking head in disbelief*Â ...Â  Nobody even cares.Â  


This is sig worthy!
Â 
Although about the "butchering of the story" .. I don't think it happened without GRRM's knowledge.
3629	lostinwesteros	2014-05-05	I think the critics pile on without trying to understand why certain moves are made.
Contrary to what was said in the OP, this served several purposes.
1. It established Jon's growing role as a leader and a fighter. This is an important thread to develop because of the vote that will happen this season, and they don't intend to show TWO battles at the Wall as happened it the books: that would not work for the show. There will be a single battle for the Wall, so Jon's leadership role needed to be established another way.
2. It reaffirmed that Jon has a certain level of respect for the opinions of both women and wildlings. He asked the women what they wanted and let them do what they would.
3. Craster's Keep is slowly setting up the role of the woman who is clearly the leader of Craster's wives. I suspect she will end up being the Woods Witch who leads the Wildlings to Hardhome. This is likely an important factor in Winds of Winter and needs to be established somehow. Watch the scenes involving that woman, and then remember Hardhome.
4. It showed for the first time what Hodor is capable of when Bran wargs him, and also how confusing and upsetting it is for Hodor when he is warged. This will also be important.
5. It allowed Bran to stay part of the story without simply showing him in endless boring scenes traveling North.
6. It gave Jon a means to reunite with Ghost.

Ok, I have been pretty irritated with the whole Craster's Keep bit the last two episodes, but this post by Hippocras makes perfect sense to me, and I think these are excellent points.  Now I've rethought my opinion - still not a big fan, but think I judged too hastily and too harshly earlier.
3630	allie4645	2014-05-05	The arc of the mutineers in the show is to kill Mormont and later on showcase Jon's leadership abilities. They aren't 'pointless'.
Â 
Â 
Why would Jon ask when he doesn't know that Bran was ever there?
Â 
Â 
Â 
The entire purpose of Coldhands was replaced by Bran having a vision on where to go (remember, he said "I know where we have to go" last season?) and the Night's Watch doing the job that they should have done in the books. And you forgot to add "A big ass dire wolf" in your list of Bran's party.
Â 
Â 
If you think that Arya has a 'positive' attitude, you aren't paying attention. Her face is nearly emotionless unless she gets angry. She's not been 'happy' since King's Landing.
Â 
Â 
Â 
My problem with Locke's involvement is that we don't know what he's planning on doing with Bran or why he tries to carry him off while leaving the others alive. I will easily admit that it could have been handled better in that respect. I have no problem with him dying, though. He was never going to become Jon's 'right hand man' anyway, because that would have been too obvious.


You're right, they're not pointless, but they were given a lot of screen time in two episodes that, IMO, could have been filed down quite a bit. Did so much time really need to be spent fleshing out how terrible they are when we already knew they had to be taken out? Did Bran really have to be so involved in this plot if the mutineers' main purpose was to showcase Jon's abilities? Did an entire scene need to be dedicated to the near-rape of Meera or a one-on-one fight between Jon and Karl?Â 
Â 
Jon, in the previous episode, speculated with Sam that Bran could be at or near Craster's. Locke remembered and went looking for them. Why wouldn't Jon, as a concerned brother, take a minute to ask if any of Craster's wives had seen him wandering around? He didn't know Bran was there, but why would that stop him from wanting to know if anyone in the area had at least seen his brother alive and well? It's just an awkward hole, I think. Not the end of the world, and not a big deal, I'm for sure nitpicking, but still something that bothers me.Â 
Â 
I do think Arya has a positive attitude. That doesn't mean that she's happy, just that she's keeping her head up, staying productive, and moving forward. Look at her interactions with Sandor. Does she seem grieving to you? Does she seem to be more emotionally affected following the RW compared the fight with Amory? Because to me, she seems the exact same as she was in S2. Maybe we're just interpreting her behavior differently, though.Â 
Â 
Bran says he knows where they have to go. That's not the same as knowing how to get there. If I know I have to walk from Texas to Ottawa, I'm still going to need some help in getting there. I can't just walk north for a couple of weeks and assume, with no other direction, that I'm in the right place. If we assume that he does, in fact, know how to get there, that's fine. But Summer is still the only protection they have going through the entire north. This could be glossed over, for sure. CH could be cut. But I still don't see how cutting him is more efficient than adding nearly an entire episode of content just for the mutineers.Â 
Â 
You're right about Locke never becoming Jon's right hand man. And his motives with Bran and his all around Scooby-Doo villainry is pretty blah. So then wasn't his time in the north sort of a waste of time if he was never going to report back to Roose in the first place?Â
3631	sj4iy	2014-05-05	Of course the book version is more believable, simply by not having ridiculous developments like some Locke guy volunteering for NW. How would that even work, please? His angle I'm interested in. You join the order that is for life, just to get some info, and then run away, knowing it's punishable by death? That makes sense to you? And anyway, how is he to take Bran and Rickon by himself? Where'sLocke's support? As other posters asked: what would he do with Bran? Carry him to The Wall and beyond?I've admitted that Locke's role could have been thought out better. But if you remember, in the book, a nice dead guy riding a dead elk appeared out of nowhere killed the mutineers and led Bran to his destination. That was one of the worst examples of deus ex machina in the entire series.Â Craster possibly had hounds, you say. All right, how come Jon doesn't remember that? But, even that aside: why the hell would they avoid hounds, with the tactics they've chosen? They're charging! Chained hounds are of no concern for them. So why would Jon listen Locke about the hounds?There's not reason to believe that Jon would remember much about the Keep, or which animals Craster had. He could have easily acquired them in the time after the Night's Watch left. He may have had them and the mutineers killed them. This argument is nothing but a straw man.Â And how does Jon look trusting Locke? What, TV Jon is just trusting a guy he just met and knows nothing about? And you find it strange I think TV Jon's a moron? And he's a moron because other characters say so. Not in so many words, but "You're even dumber than you look" comes pretty close, don't you think? Not to mention Ygritte constantly bettering him in every argument they had.Jon looks like a man who needs all of the help he can get on a dangerous mission accepting the help of a man who he knows can fight. He knew the man for a few days and had no reason to suspect him of anything. Saying that he's stupid because he couldn't see what the audience has seen is a logical fallacy.Â All of that didn't happen in the books. You're talking about the problem the show created. In the novels, Jon is trusted and respected from the start. He's hated by some very unpopular guys, like Alliser and Janos, but, prior to ADWD, he's pretty respected by other recruits and later comrades. You're projecting his TV personality into the book story, and you're making it sound like he has some reputation issues in the books. He didn't. Opposite to the show, he was very well respected in the novels. Just recall what Aemon says to him when he handles him The Wall. Just remember Donal, a character that doesn't exist in the show. Isn't he important for Jon's credibility as a character? Of course he is. But, he's omitted from the show, while we have some Karl fellow and his mutiny.No, I'm saying that he has a reputation after he runs off with the enemy. That's a pretty damn hard reputation to shake, and he doesn't really do it in the books before being elected Lord Commander. It's touched upon several times in ADWD that some of the men think he's a turn cloak and don't trust him. How does Jon 'prove' his credibility to everyone before being elected Lord Commander? How does he prove his innocence? He doesn't, because he has no trial and his deeds are not witnessed by enough people.Â The show created this problem with Jon's reputation and his competence. And then they tried to solve it. But they failed. Because, Jon looks not a bit more competent than before the last episode. He's as incompetent as he was with Qhorin. In the novels, on the other hand, he's always respected, and he's capable of carrying out the toughest missions, like infiltrating the wildlings - while in the show, he was effectively saved by Ygritte. I mean, in the books, it was he who saved Ygritte, which is why he saved him back the first chance she got. On TV, he didn't save her. She saved herself from him. He refused to kill her, but he didn't let her go. He didn't know what to do with her. And then he lost his brothers by chasing her. And then she lead him into a trap. Practically, she owed him nothing in the show. He didn't earn even her help. Small wonder his competence and respect had to be built from the scratch at this point. Book Jon has no such problems. Other than jerks like Alliser and Janos, brothers usually love and respect Jon, and we can see the reasons why. The show is an entirely different thing in that regard.Stating your opinion as 'fact' doesn't actually make it true, you know. The show didn't create any problems which didn't already exist in the text."He's as incompetent as he was with Qhorin." - in both the show and the books. He couldn't actually beat Quorin in a real fight, Quorin lets him kill him both times."He's always respected" - we must have been reading different books. He wasn't respected at all in the beginning and had to build up the trust...even then, he still did things to shatter that trust (like his attempted desertion). Quorin picked him because he thought it would be more believable that Jon desert than any of his rangers who had killed Wildlings already. That was why Quorin gave him the task of beheading Ygritte- because he wanted to see what Jon would do."He didn't save her" - He didn't behead her when he could have. He saved her life, and she even admits as much when she saves him from Rattleshirt."She leads him into a trap" - they are led into a trap in the books. How is it that different?"She owed him nothing in the show" - yes, she did. And she stated it, when she said "We're even" after saving him from Rattleshirt in "The Prince of Winterfell"."Book Jon has no such problems" - So, all of those guys in the book who talk about him behind his back and question his decisions to his face aren't 'problems'?

Â 
How are we to interpret the fact that from the get-go actors are practically rewriting the scenes? I mean, Jason Momoa and Emilia Clarke did persuade D&D to change the wedding scene in the very first episode. What do you think, what kind of message it sends throughout the industry? In case you don't know, read about how really respectable guys, like David Chase, reacted when some actors were trying to influence their writing. If the writer is so insecure about his competence that he lets such changes, that's a very bad sign.
Â 
What about Marshal's interview about filming the "Blackwater" episode? You know: about a producer that says "I represent the pervert side of the audience"? You think the crew is going to respect that producer from then on? Would you?
Â 
Or what about rumors, never denied as far as I can tell, that Charles Dance threatened to quit the show before the Season 2, unless they give him more scenes? If that's true, do you think it helped D&D's reputation? And what about the infamous HBO's statement in regards to Bush's head incident? I mean, I have zero respect for D&D, and I'd never do to them what HBO did with that statement. Or the latest incident, about the "rape"? Everybody and their sister now know neither D&D nor Graves had any idea about how the viewers are going to see the scene in question. Did it ever happen to any other show that is considered a high drama? Or to any other show at all? I'm curious, honestly.
Â 
And, last but not least, what about TV professionals that read and loved ASOIAF? And I bet there are some. You can't fool these people about some budgetary issues, or some scheduling conflict that made you give Sandor's lines to Littlefinger. (In fact, that lie was a huge embarrassment on its own right.)
3633	Dudu42	2014-05-05	Still, it's pretty easy to spot whatever story the show writters stuffed in the series.
Â 
The very assault at Craster's Keep was much, much more predicable than the average book story. Jon arrives with the good nightwatch guys (Locke being an exception), kill the bad nightwatch guys. Bran takes on Hodor, who frees himself from the chains and kill the bad guy Locke. Jon goes 1vs1 with the bad nightwatchs leader and wins the boss fight. Everything so tidy, so predicable, even if you didn't read the books you could tell it was not written by GRRM.

There's A LOT of actors who don't watch movies/shows they're in. That's almost like a religious thing among many actors. I don't know why someone should draw any conclusions based on that. Of course, it's perfectly possible Dillane just doesn't like the show. So what?

Â 
over-generalization, that's what it is.
Â 
Dillane and Hinds don't watch the show = the show SUCKS!
Â 
Momoa and Clarke offered their imput at one scene back in the pilot = ALL actors are writing ALL their scenes ALL the time!
Â 
The thing about the rape and Blackwater obviously have no excuse, it's disgusting, tacky and offensive
Â 
But who gives a fuck about Bush's head? I mean, really, no one would have even noticed if it weren't for the blu-ray extras. And this is exactly my point: you're so incredibly prejudiced against the writers that you reach to every little thing to create a criticism
Â 
"Oh, my god, did you know Dan Weiss ate a chicken sandwich back when they were shooting season 1? Well, Donald Sterling ate a chicken sandwich once too. Therefore, Weiss is a racist as well as a talentless hack"
Â 
Now, I'm not defending them, not by a mile. They've ruined (yes, I'm saying ruined) my favorite character/character arc in the entire books, which is Theon/Reek, I hate what they're doing to Cersei (another favorite) and Stannis, among many others. Like I said, I find the show progressively worse from episode to episode
Â 
But if you're going to criticize (and hey, I'm all for it, let's bitch about the adaptation, I honestly enjoy it) at least talk about the writing and not, I don't know, backstage drama or rumors. Like, how is it D&D's fault that Dance threatened to walk out? Actors' contracts are a sad reality, but you have to work around that
Â 
Now, shit like giving Sandor's lines to LF, yeah, lay that at their feet. Tyrion's whitewashing, Tommen's change in characterization, Shae's entire mess, Podrick's blunder with the whores last year, that bullshit conversation between Grey Worm and Missandei, Olenna's very obvious confession, etc, etc, etc. That's the kind of changes it's worth discussing, because that's how you really evaluate D&D's strenghts and weaknesses as writers

Jon looks like a man who needs all of the help he can get on a dangerous mission accepting the help of a man who he knows can fight. He knew the man for a few days and had no reason to suspect him of anything. Saying that he's stupid because he couldn't see what the audience has seen is a logical fallacy.
No, I'm saying that he has a reputation after he runs off with the enemy. That's a pretty damn hard reputation to shake, and he doesn't really do it in the books before being elected Lord Commander. It's touched upon several times in ADWD that some of the men think he's a turn cloak and don't trust him. How does Jon 'prove' his credibility to everyone before being elected Lord Commander? How does he prove his innocence? He doesn't, because he has no trial and his deeds are not witnessed by enough people.
Stating your opinion as 'fact' doesn't actually make it true, you know. The show didn't create any problems which didn't already exist in the text.
"He's as incompetent as he was with Qhorin." - in both the show and the books. He couldn't actually beat Quorin in a real fight, Quorin lets him kill him both times.
"He's always respected" - we must have been reading different books. He wasn't respected at all in the beginning and had to build up the trust...even then, he still did things to shatter that trust (like his attempted desertion). Quorin picked him because he thought it would be more believable that Jon desert than any of his rangers who had killed Wildlings already. That was why Quorin gave him the task of beheading Ygritte- because he wanted to see what Jon would do.
"He didn't save her" - He didn't behead her when he could have. He saved her life, and she even admits as much when she saves him from Rattleshirt.
"She leads him into a trap" - they are led into a trap in the books. How is it that different?
"She owed him nothing in the show" - yes, she did. And she stated it, when she said "We're even" after saving him from Rattleshirt in "The Prince of Winterfell".
"Book Jon has no such problems" - So, all of those guys in the book who talk about him behind his back and question his decisions to his face aren't 'problems'?


Â 
We obviously read different books. In books I read, Qhorin sees a leader in Jon and tutors him. Just like Aemon. Just like Jeor. Qhorin and Jon were not lead into a trap - they were pursued and eventually caught by wildlings, but not entrapped. In fact, Qhorin chose Jon over other rangers, to stay with him until the end. Jon didn't have to chase Ygritte - once he decided against killing her, he let her go, while in the show she freed herself from him (in a rather ridiculous way, one might add). In the books I read, Ygritte isn't ridiculing Jon's worldviews so efficiently.
Â 
Also, you're ignoring what I wrote about the hounds. Why do the hounds matter at all with the tactics Jon and crew chosen? How is it possible not to see through Locke's lie because of that? How is it possible that literally nobody among the attackers checked the hut Locke was talking about? Even further, how is it possible none of the mutineers tried to take Jon's brother as a hostage as soon as they were attacked?
Â 
Re: Jon trusting Locke - if a viewer sees one man playing another like a violin, the reputation of the latter has to suffer, don't you agree? Theoretically, you could be right that not every viewer is going to think Jon's a moron for trusting Locke. But, I don't think any of the viewers is going to think very highly of Jon's intelligence after that. I mean, Locke is not the smartest guy around, and he still manages to fool Jon so easily. So, if I had to guess, I'd say majority of the viewers thought it was very stupid on Jon's part to trust that fellow. And, one more point you're also ignoring: if not for Bran's warging, Jon would actually enable Locke to capture Bran.
Â 
About his reputation you keep going back to, no, it is not nearly as damaged as you describe it. If guys like Aemon and Donal Noye put you in charge of The Wall in a decisive battle, it counts a lot. Before ADWD, is there anyone, besides Alliser and Janos (and Rast, truth be told) who dislikes Jon? I can't remember at the time, but I don't think so. It's true he's accused of treason, but then again, he did come back to The Wall to warn his brothers, and he does tell a very believable story about him and Qhorin, a story that fits the popular opinion on Jon (a popular opinion that doesn't exist in the show).
Â 
And if you have a problem with Coldhands, or the very concept of magical/supernatural elements, and you obviously don't particularly like or respect the plot, I can't help but wonder what do you enjoy in ASOIAF at all? I'm just curious.
3642	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-05	Entertaining filler is a good assessment. 
And honestly if it mean GRRM gets slightly more time to finish than he would have had, well, I'm all for It.

Lol you beat me to it.
So I'll ask other questions to all the book purists...what do except D&D to do when they catch up to the books? Pause and wait for the old coot to finish up? Or do you all intend to hate on every scene they have to make up? 
As someone posted a while back, you must begin to see the books and the shows as separate. Otherwise, stick to the one you love more and avoid the one that annoys you
3643	Joseph Nobles	2014-05-05	I'll be surprised if Locke didn't get a letter off to the Boltons explaining where he was going and why. At the very least, the stories of how the new promising recruit died such a horrible death and Jon walked back with his direwolf will reach their ears. So now Roose and Ramsey will be escalating their suspicions of Jon Snow. That's another takeaway from this episode.
3644	allie4645	2014-05-05	I'll be surprised if Locke didn't get a letter off to the Boltons explaining where he was going and why.

This is a pretty awesome point. It'll be interesting to see if/how it will play out that way, especially with Jon's growing leadership on the Wall.
3645	Onion Smuggler	2014-05-05	It was an interesting twist on the books, if they were exactly the same there would be no point watching it. What I don't get is why Locke didn't just kill Bran there and then, wasn't that what he was sent to do?Â
3646	Miodrag	2014-05-05	Dillane and Hinds don't watch the show = the show SUCKS!


Â 
Didn't say that. Just that their attitude is indicative of a general attitude, that, based on that, might be less positive towards the show than it is suggested in promotional videos many here take for granted.
Â 



Momoa and Clarke offered their imput at one scene back in the pilot = ALL actors are writing ALL their scenes ALL the time!



Â 
Wrong. In fact, very wrong. Actors are not in the writing business. At least, not when the writers knows his/her job. As I said, just read what David Chase was doing in similar cases. And it's not that they offered their input. They persuaded D&D to change the scene. That's not the same. Not to mention that, to this day, I can't fathom why did they wanted to change one of the iconic scenes of the first book.
Â 



But who gives a fuck about Bush's head? I mean, really, no one would have even noticed if it weren't for the blu-ray extras. And this is exactly my point: you're so incredibly prejudiced against the writers that you reach to every little thing to create a criticism



Â 
It's not about Bush's head, but about the attitude.
Â 



Now, shit like giving Sandor's lines to LF, yeah, lay that at their feet. Tyrion's whitewashing, Tommen's change in characterization, Shae's entire mess, Podrick's blunder with the whores last year, that bullshit conversation between Grey Worm and Missandei, Olenna's very obvious confession, etc, etc, etc. That's the kind of changes it's worth discussing, because that's how you really evaluate D&D's strenghts and weaknesses as writers



Â 
I do that all the time. And then show-apologists reply with some pathetic "reminder" that "the show is not the same as the books" or that "D&D have to operate under TV realities". And the best one: that everybody but book-purists see how wonderful a job D&D are doing. Well, to the latter, I think what I listed is a pretty adequate reply. As a matter of fact, I don't give a damn what Stephen Dillane and Ciaran Hinds think of Martin's books. Therefore, I don't see why would they opinion about the show matter. I only point to their opinion after continuously "reminded" that everyone but book-purists adore the show. In essence, I agree with you that the actual show and actual books are to be discussed, first and foremost, but there's only so much "everybody but you loves the show" argumentation one can tolerate. Believe me, it's not show-complainers that have to be reminded to talk about the actual material.
3647	LizBe	2014-05-05	I didn't read all posts on this thread, but there's still sth I want to point out.
Â 
I didn't think that Bran's arc in these two episodes were useless filler. I thought it was a chance not only to give his group more screen time, but also to develop a bit more Bran's warg powers, specially on Hodor. It'll be important some time from now, and the Unsullied viewers need this kind of refreshing once in a while. Plus, it was a good chance to remember more and better about Jojen's powers (though I suppose they should have developed also his weak body - like, what was that thing in Oathkeeper, in which he falls and we didn't get any explanation? But I am still waiting for this...)
3648	Miodrag	2014-05-05	He admitted that he didn't care for the nudity. It had nothing to do with the show's storyline.


Â 
This is the interview I had in mind:
Â 
http://www.bigissue....-naked-ruthless
Â 
Excerpt:
Â 
Fan forums debate whether Stannis is the moodiest character in Westeros. Could that mean heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s theÂ last man standing?I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know. To be honest I havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t seen the last series. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve only seen series two so Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not really up on what everybodyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s doing, but fom what I have seenÂ JonÂ Snow is pretty moody. Is moody the right word? Serious, grumpy, bad temperedâ<U+0080>¦ There are plenty of those around. Last man standing? Your guess is as good as mine.
Â 
Â 
So no, he doesn't watch the show. Does it necessarily mean the show is bad? Of course not. I couldn't care less about what Dillane thinks of the books, or if he thinks about them at all, so why would his opinion on the show mean anything to me or anyone else?! Just wanted to point that the show is not as universally loved as some here believe. And it doesn't have to be. I mean, ASOIAF books are not universally loved. Just look at how many people - you included - are ridiculing them. and this is supposed to be the site for superfans. Does it make me love or respect the books any less? Of course not. But, on the other hand, I don't respond to criticism with "The books are so loved by so many", because that is a ridiculous argument in debates like this one.
3649	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-05	Â 
Didn't say that. Just that their attitude is indicative of a general attitude, that, based on that, might be less positive towards the show than it is suggested in promotional videos many here take for granted.


Â 
It's an overgeneralization to say that the opinion of a couple of actors is an indicative of a general attitude
Â 
Â 


Wrong. In fact, very wrong. Actors are not in the writing business. At least, not when the writers knows his/her job. As I said, just read what David Chase was doing in similar cases. And it's not that they offered their input. They persuaded D&D to change the scene. That's not the same. Not to mention that, to this day, I can't fathom why did they wanted to change one of the iconic scenes of the first book.


Â 
Oh, I can argue that the change of that scene was a good one. It showed that Dany and Drogo's relationship was actually evolving and changing for the better, instead of using that disturbing scene from the books in which rape is depicted as incredibly romantic, only to be followed by later scenes of more violent rape, which makes the whole thing very misleading, not to mention disturbing
Â 
And, yeah, actors are not writers, but sometimes they can come up with incredibly good lines and improvisations:
Â 
http://screenrant.co...d-movie-scenes/
Â 
Which is why I think it's unfair to plainly dismiss any involvement they can have to the creative process. Hell, a whole branch of actor direction is based on the cooperation and dialogue between writer, director and actor, regarding how a character is going to be portrayed
Â 
Â 


It's not about Bush's head, but about the attitude.


Â 
I don't even know what's so offensive about this (I mean, unless you're a hardcore Republican). They're adapting a series of fictional books, not a memoir of a Holocaust survivor. There's no reason why they can add a bit of levity (and again, it wasn't even an easter egg)
Â 
Â 


I do that all the time. And then show-apologists reply with some pathetic "reminder" that "the show is not the same as the books" or that "D&D have to operate under TV realities". And the best one: that everybody but book-purists see how wonderful a job D&D are doing. Well, to the latter, I think what I listed is a pretty adequate reply.

Believe me, it's not show-complainers that have to be reminded to talk about the actual material.


Â 
Fair enough. I think both sides can use a bit less overreaction

3650	SkaggCannibal	2014-05-05	Well, IMO he was going to torture Bran to know where Rickon is.


Yeah I guess that's the most plausible explanation, but then still he should have killed Jojen and Meera instead of leaving them behind to tell Jon what happened. Which would, again, result in Jon & co hunting him down.
3651	Uldra I	2014-05-05	It seems somewhat pointless now to try and illustrate a point that is generally just being thrown out the window as Hater
Speak, but just once more, and I promise I'll shut up from now until the shows are all finished.
Â 
I love the shows and until "Oathkeeper" have been arguing the case for D&D's changes from the books.Â  It'd be impossible for them to capture all the detail and show all the characters in a TV program.Â  Until "Oathkeeper" the changes made sense, consolidating characters, merging plot lines, changing the timing of events, and even leaving out scenes that won't advance the overall story enough to justify the expense.Â  All that seemed acceptable to me, and wise.Â  They've undertaken a massive project which they said in an interview they probably wouldn't even have attempted if they'd had any previous experience.Â  So, please remember, my point is not to denigrate their work.
Â 
What if you spent 20 years of your 65 years in this world composing a symphony, A Song of Ice and Fire, and had people pounding down your door for the rights to turn it into a production for the screen.Â  Martin has said he had turned down numerous offers before HBO and D&D, only to go with them because it seemed to be the right people for the job.Â  I have no idea how Martin feels about the story being portrayed as written other than he realizes there would have to be some changesÂ in the interests of expense, expedience, and time.
Â 
Until the last two episodes I personally have been defending D&D.Â  The changes all made sense and didn't really change the story too much.Â  In "Oathkeeper", however, that changed.Â  D&D have written & produced material that is entirely foreign to the books.Â  Even though the changes disturbed me in "Oathkeeper", I waited until E05 to see if they had a really, really good reason to change Martin's story.Â  In the end I couldn'tÂ see a single reason for so completely changing the story.Â  I know apologists for D&D argue it was more fun than reading the books, or they are trying to shorten the time for character development with the Craster scene,Â but...Â  They could have taken the interesting parts from the "boring" travelogues and produced some amazingly interesting TV from them, all the while developing characters.
Â 
If it were my masterpiece and I saw it being thrown out the window in order to please the sex and violence addicted viewership out there, I would have become ill at my decision to trust my story to someone else.Â  Martin may not feel the same way, but as an artist myself, I know that when you create any art, let alone a lifetime masterpiece,Â it's like it contains a piece of your soul.Â  Even the small work .Â  It really is painful to see people disrespect it.Â  I wonder if when he sold the rights, he really was able to let go of his storyÂ so much that he is notÂ appalled.Â  Has anyone seen a response from Martin about this episode?Â  Bet he is too self-controlled and politic to say something negative even if he felt it.Â  But if anyone hears an interview, please post a link.
Â 
Promise, my last post ever on whether or not the show lives up to the books....Â Â just trying to throw outÂ one moreÂ reason why it should.Â  Â By the way, it is NOT the job of the books to live up to the shows.Â Â  PLEASE remember that everyone.Â

3653	Miodrag	2014-05-05	Okay, that's too harsh. Â It is a critical favorite, it is generally recognized for good writing, good acting and being a very ambitious show.
Â 
After last season, I finally recognized D&D for what they are. Â They're good at some things, very good, the casting has generally been impeccable, the acting is generally also very good. Â But, they also totally flake out...like the multiple Daario's, multiple Mountains, etc. Â The writing is good, but VERY inconsistent. Â D&D will always go for the OMG SURPRISE over building suspense, even at the expense of plot, logic and character. Â The show is very random, they spend inexplicably large amounts of time on meaningless BS and short change major characters and storylines. Â Many of the D&D changes definitely have the 'butterfly' effect and they have more than once written themselves into a plot corner. Â Some of the changes are impossible to understand, such as Shae being a goody goody D&D are talented but flawed.
Â 
The Craster's Keep story is a case in point. Â It mind bogglingly managed to be too long and too rushed at the same time. Â The Locke plot is totally stupid and illogical, and they gave a very good character a lame death.
Â 
They spent most of the screen time showing us that they were very, very bad men. Â Who cares? They could have used that time to do something more substantial...surely there was some more pertinent dialogue than 'fuck them til their dead' that could have been created.
Â 
Same with Bran. Â Okay, I get it, his story doesn't translate that well to TV so they wanted to have something happen. Â But, really, it was lame. Â Nobody talks to the captives, it's not even clear what they plan to do...kill them or ransom them. Â Ands, another near miss...but Bran's decision was super rushed...
Â 
Not a bad idea but poorly executed.


Â 
I don't know who's responsible for casting and what problems they faced there, but it's not that all the actors fit their roles perfectly. Take Mark Addy for example. Robert is nothing if no intimidating and imposing. He's a big, strong brute, even if he's past his prime. That's important for his character, too. But, Addy is not intimidating nor imposing. On the other hand, he did a very good job, and they possibly didn't have time to look for a better solution (if there was one, at all). But, he could easily be made into intimidating person, by adding some height to him. That is done all the time in film and TV. High heels, for example. Little guys like Brando and Pacino always appeared bigger on screen than they are in real life. It was easily solvable. But, nobody seem to thought about it.
Â 
What about Renly and Loras? Miscast, if you ask me.Â Margaery? Same thing. She's so miscast, D&D actually don't know what to do with her character now that they cast Dormer. She admitted as much in few interviews. And god knows why did they decide to cast her as Margaery in the first place. People that watched Tudors (I didn't) say TV Margaery is too similar to Anne Boleyn role Dormer played there; if true, I don't know what to think, honestly. Ramsay? Total miscast. Just hear the guys voice.
Â 
About D&D's writing, it's pretty bad. The thing with writing is, it's as good as the weakest link is. And in GoT, some of the links are incredibly weak. Pod's sexual escapades? Ridiculous! Whores giving the money back?! How juvenile one must be to think of something like that. Oh, and they did it one more time, with Shae returning diamonds. Qhart? Same thing. And I could go on and on.
Â 
Directing? Very sub-par, for HBO at least. But, there we have to take into consideration possible limitations we know nothing about. So, I can't hold it against them. Directors are not the easiest people in the world to deal with, and in a tight schedule, perhaps this is was the best D&D could come up with. But, some of the decisions in that regard were scandalous, like the fast-motioning of sword-fights in episodes 5 and 15. Speeding the raw footage, just like slow-motion, can never be used as a special effect. Never ever. If you use it, viewers have to know. You can manipulate the stuff behind the screen as much as you like. But, if you're manipulating the screen (e.g. if you speed up or slow down the pictures), viewers have to be aware of that. Because, the screen is theirs. and not your. That is among the basics of the theory. But, sword-fights in episodes 5 and 15 were fast-motioned! That is a blasphemy in this business. Nobody does that. Nobody uses speeding-up or slowing-down as a special effect. And D&D did it. No excuse for that.
3654	Miodrag	2014-05-05	You are continuously asking questions trying to force me to prove points which I already have already answered without backing up your own claims. Feel free to read my post.
You've yet to actually respond to my assertion that the election of Jon to LC of the Night's Watch was more unbelievable than what has happened in the show. Whether Craster had dogs is irrelevant (and unprovable by any means). Jon's opinion of Locke means nothing, as Locke is dead and Jon never had any reason to distrust him.

My problem with Coldhands was that he was a deus ex machina to help resolve some story lines that could have been resolved in better ways. I have no problem with supernatural beings in the show...I do have problems with throwing someone like Coldhands in to resolve a situation that could have been done in a better way. I believe the show did it better by changing the death of the mutineers into a dramatic event by making the story lines of two major characters converge in one spot.


Â 
You didn't answer anything. You're insisting on comparison between two events that are not comparable, if we're talking about credibility: NW elections and a combat. The only difference I can point to is this: NW elections are not unlike at least some of the elections in real life; the fight in Craster's is not even similar to fights in real life. Young people were in charge of armies throughout history. Young people were ruling entire kingdoms throughout history. it was not the standard, but it did happen occasionally. On the other hand, charges like that one don't happen, especially after Locke's effortless spying (that was also highly unbelievable), and especially if you're trying to surprise your enemy. Also, what about Craster's wives/daughters? Do they know about Bran? Most probably. But, they just happen not to tell Jon and the crew about four prisoners captured only recently? And Bran just decides not to reveal himself to Jon, even though Bran has all the reasons to expect Jon is going to find out he was there?
Â 
You know, the more I think about the scene, more and more I realize how incredibly ridiculous it was. Coldhands, on the other hand, is not deus ex machina you present him as. Bran and company weren't captured by mutineers in the books. There was no some artificial drama similar to the one from show, that needed to be resolved. I guess Coldhands killing mutineers will perhaps have some significance later on. We'll see. Martin usually have reasons for putting something in there. But, even if he doesn't mention it ever again, it was still million times better than the nonsense we've seen in the show.
3655	Osric	2014-05-05	-But what happened to Vargo Hoat after cutting Jaime's hand? he died, so after that, he apported nothing to the story 
-what the seven hells happened to ghost on his way to the wall in the books? Nothing
-does any one knows what happened to Craster's wifes in the books after the mutiny? Nobody, they got lost somewhere  
-Book's Bran was just walking(well Hodor was walking) and doing nothing but suffer.

Here Locke had a purpose: kill all the remaining Starks, and that was a nice touch and a plus to the story of Bran. If they didn't make Ghost appear, for sure viewers had forgotten him or his relation with Jon. Also I think this is a way to keep the two story lines linked.

Until now every change has had a reason, so Craster's wifes may appear somehow after as some of the women sent to Long Barrow, or related with the ww.

Also last week there was a lot of people complaining of Jon finding Bran and how bad it will be for the story, now people complains about this. Again, this is for show viewers to keep expecting the unexpected, even some of us are excited to see what's going to happen next. I don't care how much the show is diferent from the books, at the end the main plots are the same and it makes me wanna watch it again and again
3656	DaveyJoe	2014-05-05	Directing? Very sub-par, for HBO at least. But, there we have to take into consideration possible limitations we know nothing about. So, I can't hold it against them. Directors are not the easiest people in the world to deal with, and in a tight schedule, perhaps this is was the best D&D could come up with. But, some of the decisions in that regard were scandalous, like the fast-motioning of sword-fights in episodes 5 and 15. Speeding the raw footage, just like slow-motion, can never be used as a special effect. Never ever. If you use it, viewers have to know. You can manipulate the stuff behind the screen as much as you like. But, if you're manipulating the screen (e.g. if you speed up or slow down the pictures), viewers have to be aware of that. Because, the screen is theirs. and not your. That is among the basics of the theory. But, sword-fights in episodes 5 and 15 were fast-motioned! That is a blasphemy in this business. Nobody does that. Nobody uses speeding-up or slowing-down as a special effect. And D&D did it. No excuse for that.


Â 
You are just making stuff up now and I'm starting to suspect that you are some kind of troll.
3657	Miodrag	2014-05-05	^ Why don't you take one more look at Ned-Jaime fight from episode 5 and Brienne's fight against Renly's guards in episode 15, and then come back here to tell me was I making stuff up or not?
3658	DaveyJoe	2014-05-05	No, your claim that speeding-up/slowing-down footage is blasphemy, that's absurd.
3659	Miodrag	2014-05-05	It's an overgeneralization to say that the opinion of a couple of actors is an indicative of a general attitude


Â 
It is not. Every opinion is indicative of something. That's what indicative means.
Â 

Â 


Oh, I can argue that the change of that scene was a good one. It showed that Dany and Drogo's relationship was actually evolving and changing for the better, instead of using that disturbing scene from the books in which rape is depicted as incredibly romantic, only to be followed by later scenes of more violent rape, which makes the whole thing very misleading, not to mention disturbing



Â 
You read that scene in a very strange way, have to say. And I'd really dislike the way you'd adapt it. Which is why it's probably best not to change it. I mean, it wasn't written as rape. Daenerys is capable of separating the rape from not rape, at least that is clear from her chapters very early on. Some people, like yourself, are going to see at as rape, but that's not good enough reason to change the scene. For my taste, I vastly prefer the non-linear progress their relationship has in the books. To be honest, TV scene didn't ruin anything, but I'm positive it would've been much better had they left it as in the books.

Â 


And, yeah, actors are not writers, but sometimes they can come up with incredibly good lines and improvisations:
Â 
http://screenrant.co...d-movie-scenes/
Â 
Which is why I think it's unfair to plainly dismiss any involvement they can have to the creative process. Hell, a whole branch of actor direction is based on the cooperation and dialogue between writer, director and actor, regarding how a character is going to be portrayed



Â 
I'm not denying them anything. But, if the writer done his job properly, actors don't have to change anything. (And, improvisation is not the same as rewriting.) Again, perhaps actors' interventions lead to the show being better than scripted. We don't know, but it wouldn't be impossible. However, it doesn't portray the writers very nicely, does it?

Â 


I don't even know what's so offensive about this (I mean, unless you're a hardcore Republican). They're adapting a series of fictional books, not a memoir of a Holocaust survivor. There's no reason why they can add a bit of levity (and again, it wasn't even an easter egg)



Â 
I don't give a damn about Bush. I was talking about HBO's reaction. In no time, they distanced themselves from D&D by public statement. That was not a nice thing to do. If I were D&D, I wouldn't be pleased at all with such a statement.
3660	sj4iy	2014-05-05	You didn't answer anything. You're insisting on comparison between two events that are not comparable, if we're talking about credibility: NW elections and a combat. The only difference I can point to is this: NW elections are not unlike at least some of the elections in real life; the fight in Craster's is not even similar to fights in real life. Young people were in charge of armies throughout history. Young people were ruling entire kingdoms throughout history. it was not the standard, but it did happen occasionally. On the other hand, charges like that one don't happen, especially after Locke's effortless spying (that was also highly unbelievable), and especially if you're trying to surprise your enemy. Also, what about Craster's wives/daughters? Do they know about Bran? Most probably. But, they just happen not to tell Jon and the crew about four prisoners captured only recently? And Bran just decides not to reveal himself to Jon, even though Bran has all the reasons to expect Jon is going to find out he was there?Â You know, the more I think about the scene, more and more I realize how incredibly ridiculous it was. Coldhands, on the other hand, is not deus ex machina you present him as. Bran and company weren't captured by mutineers in the books. There was no some artificial drama similar to the one from show, that needed to be resolved. I guess Coldhands killing mutineers will perhaps have some significance later on. We'll see. Martin usually have reasons for putting something in there. But, even if he doesn't mention it ever again, it was still million times better than the nonsense we've seen in the show.I answered everything- sentence by sentence in several examples. And I wasn't he one who 'insisted on the comparison between these two events"...that was you when you wrote:"There is no logic in show universe. The success of this show basically relies on viewers not thinking too much about what they saw, because in almost every episode there are some illogical outcomes that would prove unsustainable in any believable universe. I'm not talking about surprising outcomes, like the one you mention - electing Jon as The Lord Commander."You wrote that what happened here was illogical while Jon Snow getting elected Lord Commander was simply 'surprising'. You've tried several times to move the goalposts and change the argument, but never have you actually answered my question of how the events leading up to Jon Snow's election is less believable than how the directors have changed those events. You've criticized Jon Snow for not knowing that Locke was a bad guy when he had absolutely no reason to suspect the man, as well as saying that he should have known about hounds that even the audience doesn't know anything about. You said that the men respect and trust Jon and in the books, but it's very clear in A Dance with Dragons that many of them don't and think that he's still in league with the Wildlings. You say that Craster's wives should have told Jon about Bran and the others...yet it's pretty obvious that they have no love for Jon or his men and they didn't say much of anything to him at all. And it's clear that if Coldhands were a significant character in the books, he would not have been cut in the show. I never said that the mutineers attacked Bran, btw...I simply said that Coldhands killed the mutineers.You have your opinion...that's fine. But none of your 'arguments' have supported your assertions here.

You failed to read my post properly. I said it's blasphemy to use speeding-up and/or slowing-down as a special effect. Meaning, if you try to hide it from the audience. That is blasphemy. And it was never ever done by anyone else. It's the basic knowledge about film-making: you never manipulate the screen while trying to hide it from the viewers.

Â 
Let's just remember that Bran fell from the tower, turned into a warg and survived Theon's assault, for example. Not that predicable at all.
Â 
But still, I'm not comparing Bran and Jon's stories specifically, but book content with content added by D&D.

Â 
Is there a point to this? As I said, don't expect me to persuade you something is believable. You don't think Jon getting elected is believable? Fine by me. I think it is. But, it isn't ridiculous. For any fight to unravel like the one from the last episode, now, that is ridiculous. As for Locke's lie about the hounds, how is it not ridiculous? What importance do the hounds have for the attack? None! To tell you the truth, it's absurd to come up with a plan Locke seem to designed: "While the battle is raging all around the camp, I'm going to sneak into the hut and take the boy with me without anyone noticing". That has to be the most stupid idea anyone ever had in the history of television. And yeah, Craster's wives are obviously not going to help the guys that just saved them. I mean, one of them saved Jon's lives, but why tell him about the other four prisoners, right?
Â 
Just like I said, more I think about the scene, more and more moronic aspects I find. And you want to compare that to Jon being elected as LC? Be my guest. About Jon's reputations, you're talking about ADWD, while I said "before ADWD" in one of the first posts about the subject. Once he became commander, of course the opinion of him changed. But, before that? He was pretty popular, save for a few jerks like Alliser and Janos.
Â 
And the thing you keep repeating: that Jon earned some kind of trust by leading this expedition. That's illogical in and out of itself. If the mission was approved, then the mission was very important. And if Jon was in charge of the mission, then he obviously has no trust issues you're referring to. Meaning, the mission itself had no significance whatsoever on Jon's reputation as a trustworthy brother. They trusted him enough to entrust him with such an important task, after all.

What? I'm...speechless right now. I don't know what film theory you've been reading, but manipulating the velocity of footage is akin to breathing when you're shooting certain action scenes.

Â 
No need for benefit of a doubt. Be flabbergasted as much as you want, but what I'm telling you is basic theory in film-making. Go watch the scenes again, and tell me if you think all was regular there. And, even better, find me a similar example anywhere. This Chris and Scarlet thing is not that, believe me. D&D sped up not the entire scene or the entire action, as is the case with high-action movie sequences you're referring to, but only small fragments. They sped-up one Ned's charge against Jaime, and one Brienne's swing against guards. The rest of the fights is in normal speed, but those two moves are sped-up. If you think that's the same as "Avengers" thing, you're wrong. What "Avengers" did is, in essence, what Charlie Chaplin was doing all the time with his funny, sped-up walk: that's showing the footage in a manner that enhances the viewing experience. But what GoT did is something else entirely. Watch the scenes in question, and you'll see the difference.
3668	Miodrag	2014-05-05	To elaborate some more on the difference: because in "Avengers" entire action scenes were slightly sped-up, you can enjoy them even if you're aware of the speeding-up. That's because they're not exactly hiding the manipulation, or, more precisely, they're 'hiding' in the open. If every move by Chris or Scarlet is slightly sped-up, there is no problem. It is not a special effect, at least, no more than Chaplin's walk was. What D&D tried to pull in those two incidents I refer to is something else, because the whole success there depends on viewers not noticing the manipulation, while, on the other hand, it's easy to notice it because the sped-up fragments do stand out.
3669	allie4645	2014-05-05	Why is it assumed that CH wasn't important just because he was cut? Is it not possible that D&D make mistakes as far as characters go? Was Ros important because she was added? Personally, I don't see how a ragtag group of kids and one direwolf are going to make it to BR plausibly w/o a guide. D&D might cover this by saying Jojen has like a map of where they need to go somehow conveniently stored in his Greenseeing powers, but how is that less of a Deus Ex Machina than CH? There are obviously differing opinions about the importance of some characters, that's fine. I'm not saying the books are perfect or that GRRM is infallible, but how can it be assumed then that D&D are infallible? The issue for me isn't that CH was cut, as many characters in a series this large are bound to be, but that content was added that has some necessary significance, but not enough ramifications or relevance to deserve the amount of time that was given to this filler arc, and perhaps CH (or something else) was cut as a result to make time for this.Â

I still think it's very possible Coldhands is someone a viewer would recognize and they don't want to give away the game just yet.Â
3672	Colonel Green	2014-05-05	But, some of the decisions in that regard were scandalous, like the fast-motioning of sword-fights in episodes 5 and 15.

That's a huge crock.Â  Why would anybody care about speeding up or slowing down footage?
3673	Jon of the (Evil) Dead	2014-05-05	I'm sorry, Miodrag, but you're wrong. Adjusting the speed of a single motion (say, a swing of a sword) is perfectly normal and sometimes even necessary to make the entire action of the scene flow better
Â 
Let's say you're filming a chase secuence, which is the most basic example. The person who's running away is running at a perfectly good speed, nothing wrong with that. But then he has to open a door. He struggles with the door knob a few seconds, and then the entire flow of the scene is disrupted. You can speed the whole thing, but there's still going to be a noticeable gap there. So you have to speed up only that motion, only the few frames of the guy opening the door. That way he "catches up" so to speak, with the rest of the action.
Â 
It's the same thing with a fight scene. One guy doesn't swing his sword fast enough, so the sparring looks forced. So you just speed up that one swing to allow his sword to meet the other one faster and the flow looks more natural.Â

This is super true. His face is hidden in the books, but that likely wouldn't translate well on-screen. In which case I still think that they need to explain how Bran will get there w/o a map where X marks the weirwood. Maybe a super fun BR dream/vision?Â

I said that Coldhands wouldn't have been cut if he had further significance to the story. However, I do think that the content added here (Jon going to take care of the mutineers himself) is very significant to the story. It does several things:1. Adds the drama of a possible Stark reunion (even though it didn't happen in the end)2. Makes Bran choose to go North over staying with his brother3. Sets up the fact that Jon's superiors are scheming to get rid of him because they fear what will happen if he is elected4. Finally gives Jon Snow a chance to show his leadership quality...something he hasn't done until now5. Closes an arc that started with Sam and Jon wanting to help the women at Craster's Keep and being unable to because of Mormont's orders6. Gives the audience an exciting dose of action in an otherwise talkative episodeI agree that Locke's arc didn't quite work- but other than that, I think it was an improvement over what happened in the book. I am not saying they are better writers than Martin, or that that's always the case, but I think this worked better than adding Coldhands in would have.
3676	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-05	The arc with Craster's Keep accomplished several things, important to both the narrative and the characters involved, so - by definition - it is not filler. Something is considered filler when it has no bearing on... Well, anything to do with anything. It could be lifted out of the story entirely, and nothing would have changed. This story line...
Â 
- Resolved the issue of the mutineers becoming 'allies' of the wildling army.
Â 
- Provided resolution (read: death) for one character who had been around since the first season (Rast), and two characters who had been around since the third season (Locke & Karl). Whether you liked that resolution or not is entirely subjective, of course, but it doesn't change the fact that it isn't filler.
Â 
- Showed that Jon is becoming a leader among his brothers, and that his time with the wildlings has provided the Watch with an invaluable benefit.Â 
Â 
- Further fleshed out both Jojen & Meera's purpose (particularly the former), and firmly established that Bran's ultimate destination is the great weirwood tree both he and Jojen have seen in their respective visions.Â 
Â 
- From a thematic stand-point, the fact that Bran uses Hodor (through his warging ability) to kill Locke will almost certainly come up again down the road.Â 
Â 
- It answered the question that many had concerning what, exactly, was happening with Craster's sons.Â 
Â 
This is all to say nothing of the fact that this arc provided some much-needed dramatic content to Bran's story line, as well as some great action.Â 
Â 
On the topic of Coldhands: If he was important, he would've been included. Saying that the time spent on this arc could have been used to introduce and establish that character is a bit disingenuous. There's no 1:1 correlation there. I liked the change, and I liked that it set up another possible Stark reunion, but that it didn't keep them separate due to circumstances outside of their control. It gave Bran some trueÂ agency (since we all know how much this forum likes their buzz words). As for Jon 'giving up' on Bran - he didn't know, for a fact, that Bran was even there in the first place. It was just an assumption, based on the location of Craster's Keep.Â

Listen, before you start calling me names and judging me, perhaps you should learn to read posts you reply to properly. I think I explained the difference between the examples you provide, and what D&D did in the show. What you're providing are the examples of using screen-manipulation in "artful manners". Meaning, a viewer is supposed to realize the screen was manipulated. And yes, that is very common in movies. I never denied that. The "Avengers" example is even better for this discussion, because it's not as open a manipulation as these examples you provided, but, on the other hand, it isn't dependent on viewers not realizing some manipulation took place. Meaning, you can know action scenes from "Avengers" were somewhat sped-up, and still enjoy those scenes. Just like, to get back once more, everybody was aware Chaplin's walk was sped-up, and there was no problem at all.
Â 
What D&D did is a rather different thing, because once you realize they manipulated the screen, the scene looks ridiculous, cheap, artificial. It can't help, because various fragments of the same scene are showed in different speeds. If a viewer doesn't realize it, no problem. If a viewer realizes it, well, than it's a huge problem. And that is why nobody ever did anything similar. Nobody with any knowledge about movie-making, that is.
Â 
That's the best I can explain in English. I don't think it's too hard to understand it, even without my explanation. Manipulation viewers may realize = legitimate. Manipulation viewers aren't suppose to realize = very bad. Your examples and "Avengers" and every other screen manipulation falls into former. GoT falls into latter. Do the math. And calm down a little, OK?

3679	Miodrag	2014-05-05	I'm sorry, Miodrag, but you're wrong. Adjusting the speed of a single motion (say, a swing of a sword) is perfectly normal and sometimes even necessary to make the entire action of the scene flow better
Â 
Let's say you're filming a chase secuence, which is the most basic example. The person who's running away is running at a perfectly good speed, nothing wrong with that. But then he has to open a door. He struggles with the door knob a few seconds, and then the entire flow of the scene is disrupted. You can speed the whole thing, but there's still going to be a noticeable gap there. So you have to speed up only that motion, only the few frames of the guy opening the door. That way he "catches up" so to speak, with the rest of the action.
Â 
It's the same thing with a fight scene. One guy doesn't swing his sword fast enough, so the sparring looks forced. So you just speed up that one swing to allow his sword to meet the other one faster and the flow looks more natural.Â 


Â 
It is not normal. You can repeat it million times, but the fact remains nobody does that. There are action scenes wherever you look, and nobody does it GoT way. It is wrong, and if you don't see why, just watch the damned scenes again. Because of what they did the sparing looks forced, not the other way around.

Â 
I actually did watch the scenes on Youtube. Guess what? There's really nothing that jumps out as clunky or clumsy, so I think you're just seeing what you expect to see.
Â 
You obviously don't have to believe me when I say it, but speaking as a film major (though I'm just an intern at this point) I can tell you this technique is as common as it gets.Â 
Â 
In fact, I remember when you first published your critique of the "speeding catastrophe" and no one agreed with you then (as far as I remember) and no one is agreeing now. What does that tell you?
Â 
Also, I have to say it, with so many noteworthy and arguable points to criticize in this show, you focus on the speeding up of a single frame in an action secuence shot more than two years ago? Jeez
3684	Miodrag	2014-05-05	That's in no way a response to the substance of what was noted.


Â 
But, this definitely is the time to leave all you fine gentlemen. I've been down this road too many times. It's pointless to continue this discussion. Some of you are evidently disturbed I'm talking about an obvious embarrassment of the show. You'd rather argue with me all day long, instead of checking out the scenes yourself, or checking my claims that it is never to be done that way, just like it never was.

Yeah, a technique is so common, it's never used actually. What does that tell you? All those examples you and other posters are listing, aren't the same thing I'm talking about.Â And, since you're a film major, just ask your teachers about those two scenes. Let's see what they're going to say. I mean, one of us is definitely seeing what he expects to see, and perhaps your teachers can indicate who is. In the meantime, goodbye.

I think we can all agree that accusing someone of trolling is tantamount to calling him a name (namely, a troll).
Â 
I thought the sword fight in 1.05 was superior to any action we've seen in Season 4, so whatever blasphemy they committed I personally wish they'd recreate it. Â I had trouble following the fights at both Craster's and the inn due to the choreography, blocking, and editing. Â If there was a speed issue, I didn't notice it.

I think shooting the fight at Craster's as a night scene wasn't the greatest idea they've had.  The lack of light makes it difficult to distinguish characters, especially since pretty much everyone is wearing black.
3689	StrollofShame	2014-05-05	Why so? New actor + make up (probably walking dead style) along with CGI and you can't recognise anything. Plus having him completelly cut from the show usually means that he won't have an important role in the next 2 books (if any Â at all)... Why should we get a spoiler like that?

I admit I do not get this desperation to have Coldhands in the show. If he had been recognizable as ANYONE, this information would have been delivered by now in the books. His purpose in the books is pretty much served...he got the kids to Bloodraven. Why do so many think he has any other function? What, in the story, would lead ANYONE to think he is of any future importance? If he WERE of any "endgame" importance, he would have been introduced in the show either before now, or in last night's episode. Coldhands is not going to be introduced in the show, and he has served his purpose in the books. Anything else regarding him is book fan projection and wishful thinking. I know you thought he was cool. It's over now. Move past it, please!

Around 2:16, Nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s charging in a circling manner. That swing was sped up. It rolls on a different speed than the rest of the scene.
Â 
https://www.youtube....h?v=Knq_7MfHO0o
Â 
Around 2:14, Brienne swings downwards. Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s her last swing, before executing the guy. And itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s also sped up. Not as obviously as Nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s, but it is. Possibly some of her earlier swings are sped up as well, but this one definitely is.
Â 
Now, thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a viewer perspective to this, and thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a professional angle. As a viewer, one doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t necessarily have a problem with speeding up, especially if one doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t notice it. And the vast majority of viewers obviously didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t notice, nor cares. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s only natural. Viewers usually donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t pay attention to such details. But, speaking from a professional perspective, what GoT did was a blasphemy. It goes against the principles of making motion pictures. One fragment of a footage was covertly sped up, in order for the scene to be more effective. Not the entire scene, but only one fragment. In editing business, that is blasphemy, indeed. And, to my knowledge, nobody ever did anything similar. In no TV show or a movie Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen anything like that, and I watched a lot of those. That is not usual screen manipulation. Examples other posters provided represent usual screen manipulations, which arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t dependent on being unnoticed by viewers. These two scenes, however, depend only on that. Because, once one notices fragments of the scene are rolling on a different speed than the rest of it, the scene is probably going to loose itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s credibility.
Â 
It doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have to. Everyoneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s perfectly entitled to like the scene, even with noticing the speeding-up. When it comes to matters of liking or disliking, a viewer is entitled to a lot. But, from a professional point of view, the editing of those two scenes was really blasphemous. Now, had it happen only one time (Ned-Jaime), Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d think it was an accident, unintended mistake. No problem. But, because it happened twice, it shows tendency. And that is all kinds of wrong, regardless of the amount of footage that was manipulated. The amount is microscopic, indeed, but Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m talking about the attitude. Simply speaking, editing isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t supposed to be about that. Nobody does that. You donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t speed-up parts of the footage in order for them to be more effective and hope viewers wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t notice. That is not the special effect, that is messing with the screen, which is a separate layer in any viewing experience. For the viewers to believe in what they see on screen, they must have complete trust in the screen itself. That is why the screen is never to be manipulated without the viewers realizing it. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just wrong to use the screen against the viewers, which is what GoT did in these two instances.
Â 
Show-lovers tend to ignore any tendency whatsoever. Before Marshal gave that interview about a producer that "represents the pervert side of the audience", show-lovers attacked anyone who talked about the tendency of the showrunners to have as much nudity on screen as possible, even though the tendency was very obvious. And it's not much better even nowadays, even after Marshal's interview. And, this tendency about editing is less obvious. But, I'd really like for any reporter to ask anyone from the crew about these editing incidents. I'm positive no professional editor would ever say it's acceptable.

3701	Dudu42	2014-05-06	The thing is, this short arc was harmless plotwise. The intention was clear to me, provide something extra for show watchers whie keeping the plot intact to please the book readers.

And still, some book purists make a big deal about it.

My only complain is that it was very predicable, but I think that's the price you pay to don't harm the main storyline, so I'm ok with that.

I'm not a big fan of the show and I give it a lot of flack myself but, good lord, this is probably the most ridiculous complaint I've ever read about anything, seriously.
Fight scenes are by definition illusions, they are designed, choreographed and edited to trick the audience into thinking there's an actual fight going on and not two stunt guys hitting each other with foam swords. If they need to speed up the scene a little to make Sean Bean look like a competent fighter, who the hell cares?
There's a lot to criticize about the show but speeding up literally a tenth of a second of a fight scene to make it more exciting is not one of those things.

3703	SeventySeven	2014-05-06	It was filler-ish, and I think every book reader could have guessed Jon and Bran weren't going to meet, but seriously we've had much much worse filler than this. In fact, I quite liked the scene, I even went back and watched it again. If all the filler scenes were action packed sword fights, a near reunion, Jon Snow impaling a dude through his skull and burning stuff down, my general satisfaction with the show would be much higher.
Â 
I thought Locke's arc was pointless though. It was anti-climatic, I don't know what they were thinking when they wrote it.

Yeah, either they gave him an actual plot with the NW and Jon which I would have been ok with if it was good, or he should have met with Brienne. She could have cut off his hand and take revenge like in the books "that one was for Jaime", or like you say the ear like she did with Vargo.

It's almost as if they don't actually want to cut off people's heads to film the scenes.  How cheap of them!
3708	Darryk	2014-05-06	Crasters Keep was a really good addition by the writers. Don't know why people are complaining about it so much.
Â 
Gave them the chance toÂ 
Â 
a) show Jon's emerging leadership abilities, and justify his increasing popularity with younger members of the NW
b ) flesh out Jojen and Bran's storyline, and show Bran's developing abilities
c) give Burn Gorman more screentime
Â 
All in all, one of the best changes they've made IMO.

3709	Rockroi	2014-05-06	Miodrag:
Â 
We obviously read different books. In books I read, Qhorin sees a leader in Jon and tutors him. Just like Aemon. Just like Jeor.
Â 

Â 
I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t really have a dog in the fight about whether or not speeding up the film is a good idea or why Stephen Dilante doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t watch GoT (it seems pretty harmless to me); I think your opinion of the show is more critical than my own (and thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s refreshing in itself) and you and I both look at the Craster Liberation with severe incredulity. Â But to you, Craster's Keep represents a continuation of poor execution and bad decisions for the show, while to me it represents a departure from a relatively well done show until now. Â I think the season so far has been the weakest of the series, but its only half-way done AND its still better than 90% of what passes for TV nowadays. Â And while I completely agree that Jaime's rape of Cersei may be the biggest mistake the show has made, I think it can recover. Â Regardless, I don't think this is a case of either of us being "book purists" (as we are accused), but rather looking at the problems of the series in a certain way. Â 
Â 
However, you may be- just a tad â<U+0080><U+0093> over-protective of the books.Â  Look, I get your argument on Jon Snowâ<U+0080><U+0099>s election as LC of the Watch; Martin at the very least lays the groundwork for the election (even though â<U+0080>¦ I find it very hard to swallow how nearly 1000 men voted for somebody 2/3 of them had never met- AND who did not seek their votes. Â Why would anyone vote for a man who didn't seem to want the job?).Â  Regardless, your point was that being believable v. non-believable requires some grounding in either reality or laying a proper foundation ahead of time.Â 
Â 
The problem is that while you are critical of the show, you have a tendency to gloss over similar events on the books .Â  Here is an example:
Â 
In books I read, Qhorin sees a leader in Jon and tutors him.
Â 

Â 
Okay.Â  Lets break this down:

Jon hailed him. â<U+0080><U+009C>Lord Commander Mormont would see you at once. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll show you to his tent.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
Qhorin swung down from his saddle. â<U+0080><U+009C>My men are hungry, and our horses require tending.â<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+009C>Theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll all be seen to.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
The ranger gave his horse into the care of one of his men and followed. â<U+0080><U+009C>You are Jon Snow. You have your fatherâ<U+0080><U+0099>s look.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Did you know him, my lord?â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>I am no lordling. Only a brother of the Nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Watch. I knew Lord Eddard, yes. And his father before him.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
Jon had to hurry his steps to keep up with Qhorinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s long strides. â<U+0080><U+009C>Lord Rickard died before I was born.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>He was a friend to the Watch.â<U+0080><U+009D> Qhorin glanced behind. â<U+0080><U+009C>It is said that a direwolf runs with you.â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â

Â 
And thus ends every word spoken between Jon Snow and Qhorin Half-hand before Qhorin chooses him for the mission.Â  Literally, about 35 seconds of interaction.Â  After that, Mormont appears, the men talk, Jon leaves to get breakfast for the two men, returns to the tent (taking all of maybe 5 minutes) â<U+0080><U+0093> he returns to the tent and â<U+0080>¦ Qhorin drops the bomb that he wants to take Jon on the mission North, which leaves Mormont perplexed.Â 
Â 
What was it in there wherein Qhorin Halfhand saw â<U+0080><U+009C>a leaderâ<U+0080><U+009D> in Jon?Â  Did he â<U+0080>wrastle-up the bacon in a particularly heroic manner? Now, I get some of the context- Qhorin knows OF Jon Snow- the direwolf comment and he knows the family-line.Â  But what was it about Jon Snowâ<U+0080>¦ saying â<U+0080><U+009C>hiâ<U+0080><U+009D> that made Qhorin see a leader?Â  And why was Jeor so caught off-guard if it seemed natural that Jon was such a leader?Â 
Â 
Here is my point: there is questionable writing in the books as well.Â  At times is shallow; Martin uses some short-hand to move the story along.Â  There are times were characters draw conclusions quickly and do things that require more explanation than given. I mean, - again using Jon as an example- the Lannisters are the richest family in Westeros, yet they lack a Valayrian Steel sword. Â Jon Snow? Â He gets one after being in the NW for all of 3 months. Â 
Â 
In other words, its not just the show that tries to gloss over things or take short-cuts. Â Martin did to.Â 
Â 
Now, I am going to briefly address some of your other points, but for brevityâ<U+0080><U+0099>s sake I am only going to dedicate a few words; that and remember that I ultimately agree with you on Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Keep, especially your biting point that AFTER the liberation is over â<U+0080>¦ how come none of the wives mention to JS that for a few days there were three highborn people in the camp along with a giant?Â  That, ah, seems relevantâ<U+0080>¦
Â 
On the subject of Ygritte:
Â 
Â 
Jon didn't have to chase Ygritte - once he decided against killing her, he let her go, while in the show she freed herself from him (in a rather ridiculous way, one might add). In the books I read, Ygritte isn't ridiculing Jon's worldviews so efficiently.
Â 

Â 
I agree with the first point, and quibble with the second.Â  Ygritte is ridiculing Jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s world view in the books, but she has more time to do it; it takes the form of narratives and long stories because, well, we have the time.Â Â  I also thought Jon defended his world â<U+0080><U+0093>view better in the show than in the books. And overall- I kinmd of like Ygritte's jibbing of Jon Snow - she even seems to be making fun of book-Jon Snow (her mockery of how he has slain men and WW but he's afraid of a naked girl). Â I think that Ygritte's humor and style- edgy, rough, mocking- is refreshing in a world so dour. Â 
Â 
Though, to be fair, there was nothing worse than the season 3 finale where Ygritte- a woman with no riding experience and no knowledge of the North -somehow was able to track down Jon Snow â<U+0080><U+0093> an experienced rider with ample knowledge of the terrain.Â 
Â 
On Dormer as Maergery and Renly:
Â 
You made the point that both were miscast.Â  I disagree on both.Â  Maergery and Renly are- for better or worse- different characters in the show than in the books.Â  Maergery is far more prominent and Renly, sadly, far different.Â  Dormerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Maergery is really fun to watch. She is power-hungry and scheming, which makes her more compelling. Â Is she the same as her character on the Tudors?Â  Yes and no, but ultimately thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a far greater indictment of the Tudors than it is of Dormer â<U+0080><U+0093> the show did very little with ANY of their female characters (outside of Henryâ<U+0080><U+0099>s first, Spanish wife) and Dormerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Ann was fine, but- as you said yourself â<U+0080><U+0093> sometimes actors cannot get away from bad writing. I think she puts a lot more polich on her acting; gives it more zip, more life and definitely more edge. Â 
Â 
Renly was just poorly written.Â  IN the books, Renly is a dashing, charming knight with a deep understanding of what he is doing and why.Â  In the show, he has been replaced by a wishy-washy, unsure and uninspired little man who is a puppet of a greater house; that charming ersatz-Robert is gone and replaced by â<U+0080>¦ franklyâ<U+0080>¦ a clichA©.Â  I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t blame the actor; I blame the part.
Â 
And maybe the show-runnersâ<U+0080><U+0099> greatest fail has been Stannis and their belief that Renly would â<U+0080><U+009C>unquestionablyâ<U+0080><U+009D> be a better King than Stannis.Â  It boggles the mind that they actually thought that.Â 
Â 
On Dilante not watching the show and DanceÂ demandingÂ a bigger part:
Â 
In the Huffington Post piece that was linked, Dilante seems to really like the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s story and speaks of it very highly; in the story you linked, he only says he does not watch; he does not seem to be making a judgement on its quality.Â  As others have stated, this can be for many reasons, butÂ  Dilante would not be the first actor who did not watch themselves on TV or film (IIRC, the woman who played Cat also never watched herself).Â  Its not a rare thing and certainly not indicative of a man who hates the show heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s on. Â And pays his bills. Â 
Â 
The rumor that Dance threatened to leave if they did not write him more stuff?Â  Mehâ<U+0080>¦ may be true, may not. Â I find it hard to believe considering Dance must have known he would have a small part in Season 1, so why would he wait until before Season 2 to start complaining?Â  Chances are they told Dance that the part would grow bigger and Dance â<U+0080><U+0093> to one degree or another- kept them to their word. Â I have heard many interviews from Dance that he thinks the writing is great.
Â 
Also, there are a variety of stories out there that the actors love the show and many do more publicity than you would think if they did not. Â Now, this does not prove anything, but its a counter to the point that its a sign f how much the actors have control over the show. Â 
Â 
On HBO not backing D&D during the â<U+0080><U+009C>George W. Bushâ<U+0080><U+009D> head thing:
Â 
I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see a rift between HBO and D&D because they distanced themselves from the revelation (the â<U+0080><U+009C>revelationâ<U+0080><U+009D> was on the DVD commentary; it did not hit the mainstream media for many weeks later).Â  I think that HBO could think D&D are the greatest, most superior writers of the last 4 generations and they STILL would have done that action.Â  Why?Â  Because thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s how corporations act: they do not want controversy or glitches in public perception to ruin or interfere with the â<U+0080><U+009C>Goose that is Laying the Golden Egg.â<U+0080><U+009D>Â  HBO- up until GoT- was riding a string of losers and missteps (Big Love, Bored to Death, The Comeback, Enlightened, Hung, Luck, In Treatment, No 1 Ladies Det Agency) â<U+0080><U+0093> even their successes (Rome, Deadwood) had been pulled for costs or difficulties with writers.Â  Even their â<U+0080><U+009C>hitsâ<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+0093> Boardwalk Empire for instance- were pedestrian, or not popular with audiences (the Wire- while a critical success- never caught on with the general public).Â  GoTâ<U+0080><U+0099>s trajectory had no ceiling after that first season and HBO was not going to let a small controversy over a fake, ex-Presidentâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head get in the way.Â  That really has nothing to do with support or difficulty with D&D.
Â 
Now, other issues you had, frankly, I agree with- the â<U+0080><U+009C>pervertâ<U+0080><U+009D> line; the Jaime-rape scene, etc and I do think they show some problems with the show. At the same time- this is D&Dâ<U+0080><U+0099>s first work on ANY TV show (and, I guess to you, it shows).Â  I think they have done pretty well so far.Â 
Â 
To me, I think the source-material is a major reason for the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s success; but that is by no means a guarantee for success in TV/film- look no further than Bonfire of the Vanities and any Shakespeare adaptation. Â Further, the show has added in a lot of scenes and ideas and stories that HAVE been really fun to watch (mostly character-interaction not addressed in the books: Tywin-Arya, Robert-Cersei etc). Â And to me, that makes Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Keep such a disappointment, while to you its more of â<U+0080><U+009C>what did you expect?â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
I expect more.Â  I think the show that can deliver Blackwater and the Red Wedding and Tywin Lannister talking and Maergery Tyrell eating up the scenery and Tyrion and wit, sarcasm and charm- I think THAT show has to do a better job Â and NOT do shorthand like they did at Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Keep.Â 
Â 
Otherwiseâ<U+0080>¦ we are Lost. Â
3710	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-05-06	Karl and Locke made it much better than the dragon-stealing clusterfuck of season 2.
3711	Chebyshov	2014-05-06	Crasters Keep was a really good addition by the writers. Don't know why people are complaining about it so much.
Â 
Gave them the chance toÂ 
Â 
a) show Jon's emerging leadership abilities, and justify his increasing popularity with younger members of the NW
b ) flesh out Jojen and Bran's storyline, and show Bran's developing abilities
c) give Burn Gorman more screentime
Â 
All in all, one of the best changes they've made IMO.


Â 
This is how I feel. I think half the problem is that they are hell-bent on having episode 9 be the Battle of Castle Black, which is too late in the time frame (IMO the part that comes afterwards is more interesting), so all Jon would have to do otherwise this season is sit and mope in an ice cell. Meanwhile, Bran is just an utterly boring character on screen (and in the books, according to some). His story is so difficult to portray in any sort of engaging way through the television medium.
Â 
The Craster's plot addition did just what Darryk pointed out, and did so in a way that really didn't alter the story in a major sense. It also allowed for Jon and Ghost to be reunited, when we didn't see Ghost for nearly all of Season 3, and people would be confused why they weren't together in the first place. And it tied up the mutineers loose end, which given the absence of CH, needed to be handled some how.
3712	The Boar of Gore	2014-05-06	Because, GHOST man, GHOST!
Â 
Seriously, I think that is all we're getting out of this.


Â 
Yeah but it made no sense for Ghost to be locked up there in the first place. He could have been ranging on the other side of the Wall and met up with Jon the next time Jon went across, just like in the books.
Â 
I don't mind them deviating from the books if the writing is good, but if it's just going to be humdrum I'd rather they stuck with the GRRM story. Or at least write something that makes sense and doesn't go nowhere.

3714	Chebyshov	2014-05-06	He's still a wolf. He's not a god.


Â 
Yes, he's able to be captured. But why in Seven Hells would the mutineers have kept him alive?
Â 
IMO, the show audience needed some kind of explanation of where Ghost was this past season, so his being caged was really just to that end. I really hope they focus on the direwolves more moving forward (and maybe some Nymeria dreams, please).

But it led to Rast becoming dog chow, so I can accept it XD

Â 
Love the "fooking legend" 
Â 
This is also why I didn't mind these scenes. Ghost eating Rast was an awesome payoff, and I screamed when Bran!Hodor broke Locke's neck. It was nice to be surprised. And much nicer than the Talisa-stabbed-in-stomach surprise from last seasonÂ
3717	Victorian Beckoy	2014-05-06	Craster's wives' decision to 'find their own way' would have made much more sense if they had shown the NW emptying the larders before burning the place down. At least Ghost feasted on Rast before appearing all satiated to Jon, otherwise a season-long diet of chicken drumsticks might have prompted him to be cremated inside whilst sucking the fat out of those pigs Craster had valued so much.
3718	Ankou	2014-05-06	Â 
Yeah, and Nobody seems to mind that this is not the story that GRRM tells either.Â  I guess as long as you have tits and ass and blood, D&D can feel free to butcher a man's lifetime achievement with abandon.Â  Sheesh...Â  *shaking head in disbelief*Â ...Â  Nobody even cares.Â  


They didn't light his books on fire. Even if they butcher his story on the show it has nothing to do with GRRM's achievements, except for episodes he writes.Â

Around 2:16, Nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s charging in a circling manner. That swing was sped up. It rolls on a different speed than the rest of the scene.
Â 
https://www.youtube....h?v=Knq_7MfHO0o
Â 
Around 2:14, Brienne swings downwards. Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s her last swing, before executing the guy. And itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s also sped up. Not as obviously as Nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s, but it is. Possibly some of her earlier swings are sped up as well, but this one definitely is.
Â 
Now, thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a viewer perspective to this, and thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a professional angle. As a viewer, one doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t necessarily have a problem with speeding up, especially if one doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t notice it. And the vast majority of viewers obviously didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t notice, nor cares. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s only natural. Viewers usually donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t pay attention to such details. But, speaking from a professional perspective, what GoT did was a blasphemy. It goes against the principles of making motion pictures. One fragment of a footage was covertly sped up, in order for the scene to be more effective. Not the entire scene, but only one fragment. In editing business, that is blasphemy, indeed. And, to my knowledge, nobody ever did anything similar. In no TV show or a movie Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen anything like that, and I watched a lot of those. That is not usual screen manipulation. Examples other posters provided represent usual screen manipulations, which arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t dependent on being unnoticed by viewers. These two scenes, however, depend only on that. Because, once one notices fragments of the scene are rolling on a different speed than the rest of it, the scene is probably going to loose itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s credibility.
Â 
It doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have to. Everyoneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s perfectly entitled to like the scene, even with noticing the speeding-up. When it comes to matters of liking or disliking, a viewer is entitled to a lot. But, from a professional point of view, the editing of those two scenes was really blasphemous. Now, had it happen only one time (Ned-Jaime), Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d think it was an accident, unintended mistake. No problem. But, because it happened twice, it shows tendency. And that is all kinds of wrong, regardless of the amount of footage that was manipulated. The amount is microscopic, indeed, but Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m talking about the attitude. Simply speaking, editing isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t supposed to be about that. Nobody does that. You donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t speed-up parts of the footage in order for them to be more effective and hope viewers wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t notice. That is not the special effect, that is messing with the screen, which is a separate layer in any viewing experience. For the viewers to believe in what they see on screen, they must have complete trust in the screen itself. That is why the screen is never to be manipulated without the viewers realizing it. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just wrong to use the screen against the viewers, which is what GoT did in these two instances.


Â 
For the record, I am a professional video editor and this argument is total nonsense.

Â 
What a surprise.
3721	DormeDwayne	2014-05-06	And still, some book purists make a big deal about it.


Â 
That's a bit unfair - I disliked the inclusion of the arc, but not because I'm a book purist (even though I'm an 'old' book reader). There have been several deviations, inclusions and omissions that I really liked. This one simply served no purpose, eliminated a future internal conflict I was really looking forward to and was not even entertaining or even interesting to watch. That's just my opinion, of course - I understand many viewers may have found the scenes entertaining, and their opinion is perfectly legit - but so is mine. That's not a book purist making a big deal about it, that's a show viewer who happens to also be a book reader expressing their own, subjective personal opinion.
3722	Colonel Green	2014-05-06	Simply speaking, editing isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t supposed to be about that. Nobody does that. You donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t speed-up parts of the footage in order for them to be more effective and hope viewers wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t notice.

"Against" the viewers?Â  What on earth are you talking about?Â  Why would anybody care about using editing to create an impression, and why would that be any different from any other effect?Â  Because the sacredness of "the screen"?
Â 
I criticize this show plenty on my own, so I'm far from an automatic defender of it.Â  But this is one of the silliest criticism I have ever seen, not just about this show, but about any show.

Yeah, I already talked about this, but as a film major (and a human being) I'm seriously shell-shocked at Miodrag's argument. I mean, rarely do I see someone being so wrong about something and refusing to accept it. And the sheer hyperbole of it: calling it a blasphemy (really?) and saying that no one has ever done it before (even if that editing technique is literally used in virtually every action sequence).Â 
Â 
But I'll let it go, even if Miodrag won't (seriously, this was more than two seasons ago, get over it!). There are lots of other things to nitpick about this show, and this isn't even a nitpick

3725	superdeluxe	2014-05-06	Great Filler:
Â 
Viewer Complaints: Bran's journey is boring - Craster's gave him something to do, plus HODOR.
Â 
Jon Snow: Not believable as a leader of men, kind of a coward - Craster's rally troops to his side to go and get traitors, shows he can lead men and kick A.
Â 
So yeah technically filler (But then again most of Game of Thrones is 'filler'), but serves its purpose.
3726	jakmanuk	2014-05-06	I agree. Worse than being filler, it was futile filler. It took a grand total of 2 episodes(about 40 minutes) to solve.
Â 
Locke was decent enough for a show only character. He also provided a tie to the south for the Wall. Something this plot sorely lacks pre-Stannis. Karl was similarly somewhat entertaining.Â 
Â 
Why not keep them around, see where their characters can effect the story? Why not have the mutineers join Mance at a pivotal time to help turn the battle? Why not have them simply sit tight in Craster's and fight the Others or interact with Stannis' army in some way? Why not keep Locke around to turn on Jon at some dramatic moment?
Â 
It seems like the show can't decide if it wants to veer away from the books or maintain the plot.Â  They add things only to drop them for a contrived or blatantly obvious reason later on to tie things back to the books.
Â 
Also: WTF are Craster's wives going to do? They have no arms, just burned their only shelter, and have likely never left the keep before. Where are they going to go? Why would they not simply stay at the only place they've ever known? Or at least take the nice guy who just saved your lives up on his offer to take you to a warmer place with no ice zombies? How will they survive in the permanently frozen wasteland that is the show's Beyond the Wall? Is there any explanation even possible for what their next move is? They don't seem to want to go to Mance(who they have no way of finding besides) given they want to "make their own way."
Â 
This is such a blatant "we don't want to solve this problem we wrote ourselves into" move.


Â 
I think they did this because they've given up on life really, I'm not sure :/

Let's not feed the troll.
3728	Blazfemur	2014-05-06	Definitely a filler episode, Jon uniting with Ghost was a note of importance, and Bran's disregard for warging into humans becomes more apparent (it's supposed to be considered "wrong," and an "abomination")
Â 
I dont see why Bran couldnt attempt to force himself into Karl to begin with, it wouldve saved a lot of time. Sure there wouldve been a struggle, but you never know, Bran mightve overtook him.
3729	King Cheops	2014-05-06	As someone who hates <sneer>Lord Snow</sneer> and Bran in the books and on the screen this arc was much more enjoyable than just about anything related to those two. Â I really hope that Brienne or Jaime get to kill these two.

This has to be the most thoughtful and most serious disagreement with myself I ever encountered on this site, and I encountered any number of those. I thank you for that. I appreciate it big time.
Â 
Now, to work. First, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m a book-purist. People here treat it as some kind of disease. It is not. It is a general stance on adaptations, meaning: if it was on me, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d always try to stay as close to the source material as possible. That is neither a fault nor a virtue on its own, but my preference. And honestly, I think itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s among the most logical one. Why would I want to change something I love and respect? Example: I dislike â<U+0080><U+009C>dracarysâ<U+0080><U+009D> moment from the books. For my taste, it was too predictable and too easy, in short â<U+0080><U+0093> too convenient. It wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t terrible (I like the prose in that chapter), but itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bellow the standard GRRM himself set. But, if I was to adapt the books into TV show, I wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t change it, because I know readers predominantly love the scene. In fact, it is one of the most iconic scenes in Danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s entire arc, according to readersâ<U+0080><U+0099> reactions. And that â<U+0080><U+0093> the reward it brought to so many readers â<U+0080><U+0093> would be the most important thing for me. I would never try to â<U+0080><U+009C>improveâ<U+0080><U+009D> that in adaptation, because Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d trust the general results GRRM achieved more than Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d trust my own opinion on a particular scene. Like, if my own creativity is the most important thing for me, then what the hell am I doing with another manâ<U+0080><U+0099>s work?! That is the way Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d treat any work I respect. But, I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t expect everyone to think like me. That would be ridiculous. So no, I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t deny D&D the right to change things from the source material. It is between them, GRRM and HBO to decide how much theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re going to change. On the other hand, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m still going to have an opinion about each of their changes. Why not? However, that opinion isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t clouded by my purism. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s utterly arrogant to think that criticism of the show may stem only from book-purism, like many show-lovers argue constantly. That ridiculous accusation is usually delivered by posters who themselves have opinions clouded by any number of things: visual medium that inspires so-called â<U+0080><U+009C>passive consummationâ<U+0080><U+009D>, advertising campaign, promotional videos, interviews, and even by other posters. The level of conformism in our day and age is alarming, and this forum is, sadly, not an exception.
Â 
I repeat: none of the issues I have with the show is in any way related to my purism. I manage to separate impressions from opinions quite fine. Therefore, I know there are changes and there are changes. Even bad changes differ among themselves: some are damaging on the long run, some are damaging only short-term, and some are utterly pointless but not damaging. Behind some bad changes there was a good idea, but the execution went wrong.
Â 
Letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s focus for a moment on Tywin-Arya scenes. Majority thinks those were some great scenes. But, when you challenge that notion, it always boils down to this: it was great to see Dance and Maisie together. And they both are quite powerful on screen, indeed. But, is it a good enough reason for the change? I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think so, because Roose is also played by a very good and charismatic actor, and Rooseâ<U+0080><U+0099>s conversation with Arya wouldâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve been more instrumental. In ASOIAF universe, Roose is simply more important for the story than Tywin is (though both are very important secondary characters). So, story-wise, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s more rewarding to flesh Roose than Tywin. Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what George did in ACOK. And besides, putting scenes just so that two actors can work together is somewhat shallow. Like, what wouldâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve happen if Dance was cast as Yoren, for example? Would the show extend Yorenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s storyline, so that he and Arya can have more screen-time together? This â<U+0080><U+009C>actors first, writing secondâ<U+0080><U+009D> approach is not my favorite, to tell the truth. But, all in all, Tywin-Arya scenes ruined nothing. It achieved very little, and the general story lost much by omitting Roose-Arya scenes, but, in show universe, it was not bad. Like I said, how much potential of the source material will D&D use is on them, HBO and (to a lesser extent) GRRM.
Â 
But, what I find an exaggeration of the highest order, is this notion that Tywin-Arya scenes were an improvement of the source material. Oneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s perfectly entitled to think it really is an improvement, but Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m also perfectly entitled to view that notion only as a result of misunderstanding or misremembering Aryaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ACOK arc. And when I say that, those aggressive show-lovers tend to accuse me of purism. And like, yes, I am a purist, but that has nothing to do with how superior book story is to the show story in that case. (Or in any other case, for that matter. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m still to hear about any improvement the show made on the books.)
Â 
And then, there are simply bad changes. Not because theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re changes, but because theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re badly scripted scenes. Like Amory nonsense from season two. Like whores giving the money back to Pod. Like Shae angrily refusing diamonds from Tyrion, only to be not angry at all in the very next scene two of them have together. Like Jaime killing Alton for no reason at all â<U+0080><U+0093> yes, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s also kinslaying, but, in the show universe, kinslaying was never established as a grave sin; but, killing the one person whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s willing and capable of helping you in your escape is simply bad writing. Like having Brienne carry two swords, so Jaime can conveniently grab one (which couldâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve been avoided by moving the scene from season two finale, in which Brienne kills Stark soldiers, to season three â<U+0080><U+0093> however, that would require some long-term planning). Like Theon being knocked down not before he delivers the speech. And so on...
Â 
It doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t mean books are perfect. But, nothing ever is perfect. People seem to think that if a work didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t achieve perfection, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a good enough justification to â<U+0080><U+009C>improveâ<U+0080><U+009D> the said work. Funny enough, those same people often bitch when someone criticizes something they love (the show), but it goes beyond hypocrisy. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pure disrespect for creativity. Just look at how often production difficulties are discussed here. And, truth be told, this show is very challenging production wise. Possibly the most challenging show ever in that regard. But, no production difficulties can match the biggest difficulty in any creative process: starting from a blank page. Creation of deep and engaging characters that go through the rich plot that also emphasizes and examines rewarding themes â<U+0080><U+0093> that is the most difficult thing in storytelling, regardless of the medium that delivers the story. If one fails to realize that, oneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hardly fit to discuss creative decisions, regardless of their actual quality.
Â 
Even with imperfections, the novels stand those endless tests theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re put to, in discussions on this and many other sites. The reason is, theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re never ridiculous. There are scenes you or I find sub-par. But, in each of those scenes, we can at least figure out whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going through the heads of characters involved. You think Qhorinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reasons for choosing Jon are underexplained, which is a legitimate remark, but, as you noticed, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s easy for a reader to come up with some explanation that sounds reasonable. Opposite to that, what was going through Lockeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head when he tricked Jon and the crew into avoiding the hut with Bran and company? â<U+0080><U+009C>Everythingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going to be OK if they stay away from the hut, because Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m gonna take the boy and run, and nobodyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going to catch meâ<U+0080><U+009D>?! Or when he joined NW? â<U+0080><U+009C>Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll take the oath that is for life and breaking of which is punishable by death, because someone there must know something about those Stark boys nobody heard off recentlyâ<U+0080><U+009D>?! What can possibly go through Talisaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head when she asks a king she just met for the first time about his ultimate strategy and political goals?! What can possibly go through Talisaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head when she asks Robb is he angry at her because sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pregnant?! What is going on through Pyat Preeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head at any given moment?! Why is Tywin at first saving prisoners because, as he says, Lannisters need every single body, but then starts executing his own soldiers (not the prisoners, mind you) when Amory is killed?! By the way, what happened to the said investigation that was more important than lives of Lannister soldiers?! And how come no Lannister soldier remembers the girl Amory was chasing not long ago and right before he was killed?! Rattleshirt is releasing Jon... why exactly?! One of my favorites: whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going through Margaeryâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head while sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s suggesting the threesome with Loras?! Is she having an incestuous relationship with Loras? Did she just revealed it to Renly? Or is she willing to have sex with her brother just so Renly can get excited? What is going through Littlefingerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head when he decides to carry Nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bones to Renlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s camp?
Â 
And I could go on, but you get the point. Purism has nothing to do with my biggest complaints. As for the books, I gladly discuss other peopleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s complaints on them, but not when booksâ<U+0080><U+0099> possible imperfections are brought up just so the show-lovers can â<U+0080><U+009C>defendâ<U+0080><U+009D> D&D. Now, there is one possible weak spot of the books that the show exposed: when in season one Shae tells Tyrion that no girl would go to bed with him only hours after she was almost raped, it does sound correct. Granted, weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re still to find out what exactly happened with Tysha, but, for now, TV Shaeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reasoning sounds more solid than Jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s final confession to Tyrion in the books. Also, Ned seeing Arya and directing Yoren toward her was a nice addition: wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t call it an improvement, because the chapter with Nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s beheading hardly needs an improvement (and I canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see how this addition could be added without ruining Aryaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s POV, which would be a crime), but for a TV show that isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t told through POVâ<U+0080><U+0099>s it was a nice addition. And, Theon burning the letter was a good adaptation, considering the show does lack both time and the insight into Theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head to convey his inner hysteria from ACOK properly. So, you see, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not clouded by my purism.

Wow. I never thought there would be a real person who hates Jon. Humanity never fails to surprise.
3733	Blazfemur	2014-05-06	Wow. I never thought there would be a real person who hates Jon. Humanity never fails to surprise.


Â 
i like what he's turning into, i like where his character's evolution was headed. hated beginning Jon. and i still cant stand bran
3734	Indigocell	2014-05-06	Even though this never happened in the books, I don't think it is fair to call this filler.Â  I know filler from when I used to watch anime... It was terrible, never added anything to the overall story.
Â 
I'm sure the point has already been made, but this episode served a basic purpose of character development for both Jon and Bran.

Â 
Most viewers think Bran's story is boring - we can't have him literally keep walking to the tree for three seasons. This gives Bran and the gang something to do. Stannis basically sat on his arse last season and it sucked, they're going to learn from that and give Bran something to do.
Â 


Â 
I agree with this.
Â 
I hated reading Brans chapters.
Â 
Has anyone seen Clerks 2 and seen the summary Randal gives about LoTR? Apply that summary to Bran. 3 books of walking.
Â 
Atleast we had Coldhands in the books to keep us occupied, Im not overly fussed with his disappearance in the show, hes a glorified tour guide, but he was there to break up the mundane. For the most part, Unsullied have no idea and very little interest in the more mystical part of this world. The show needed something to get the viewers interested in whats happening beyond the wall.
Â 
This filler, did that. Weve been introduced to a massive WTF from the Nights King (if indeed that is who he is), theyve had a bit of a side story and given Jon something to do while Stannis is filling out a loan application.
Â 
Also, with the threat of the books catching up to the show and characters running out of chapters, theres going to be a lot more filler in the future.
Â 
I just hope it doesnt have as many facepalm plot holes as this one did.

I bet Stannis' credit score took a dive after Blackwater.

Â 

Â 
But thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not â<U+0080>filer.â<U+0080><U+0099>Â  The show never intended it to be â<U+0080>filer.â<U+0080><U+009D> My complaint for â<U+0080>filer;â<U+0080><U+0099> is not merely a divergence from the books.Â  â<U+0080>Filerâ<U+0080><U+0099> is basically empty-time in the story that in no way develops to a final conclusion.Â  Â The book has some filer; the show is getting more and more filer.Â  Obviously, the reveal of the Night King is a huge moment and is fine for what it is; whether I liked it aesthetically etc is not the point.
Â 
Bran at Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s?Â  Grade-A filer.Â  Cow lips and hooves in my "all beef" hotdog; the baking soda in my cocaine. Â Has no value to the story and zero value to the underlying narrative.Â  Even the biggest supporters of the scene all say- in effect- the same thing â<U+0080><U+009C>Well, in the books, Bran is boring so they had to make him do something!â<U+0080><U+009D>Â  Yeahâ<U+0080>¦ filer; doing something just for the sake of doing it.Â  Have him wander to Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Keep and doâ<U+0080>¦ nothing.Â  Literally nothing; have him get near Jon, but GOOD GOD donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have them interactâ<U+0080>¦ Â 
Â 
Filer is NOT merely a change in the actual story; they can do that all they want.Â  Filer is empty space that does not add anything.Â  In fact, with Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Keep it actually seems to be detracting from the story.Â  NOBODY can explain 1) why Bran is not 300 miles away from the Wall, but a mere 60; 2) why they got there as opposed to "everywhere-else-in-the-North," 3) how the deserters captured Ghost; 4) why they kept him, (best answer I heard: they were starting a zoo), 5) WTF was Lockeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s plan, how did he intend to carry it out, 6) how come the women at Crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s - after they were rescued -never bothered to mention â<U+0080><U+009C>Hey, where did that cripple boy, the two high-born kids and that Giant go? Weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve been with them for the last few daysâ<U+0080>¦â<U+0080><U+009D> etc etc etc.Â 
Â

Â 
theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve had a bit of a side story and given Jon something to do while Stannis is filling out a loan application.
Â 

Â 
And thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s my problem- why not just have Stannis do what he did in the books?Â  Have him rescue the Wall, be the 100% bad-ass that he is (Perish.The.Thought.) and have him THEN be a PITA for everyone for 2 episodes? IN the build-up have the battle at the Wall with the anguish of a long siege etc. Â How great would that be?Â  Unleashing bitter, resentful Stannis onâ<U+0080>¦ Alister Thorne and Jon Snow?Â  I would watch that for a year.Â  We saw it in the books?Â  Why not give us that?Â 
Â 
Instead of â<U+0080>¦ Branâ<U+0080>¦ hereâ<U+0080>¦ but not doing anythingâ<U+0080>¦ and not interfacing with â<U+0080>¦ anyoneâ<U+0080>¦ hooray?Â

Â 
Bran and his group had a fuck ton of character development in that episode.Â 
Â 
Bran: chooses his mission over his brother, wargs into another human being and forces him to kill someone
Â 
Jojen: we see a hint about his death and understand about his green seeing more
Â 
Hodor: We see that Hodor is absolutely horrified to see what Bran made him do. Â I expect it to be a plot point later on

Bran's journey is one of my least favorite things in the books (with Mereen being dead last), but I thought this story was a great improvement over the books.

3739	Frey Pies	2014-05-07	Crasters Keep was a really good addition by the writers. Don't know why people are complaining about it so much.
Â 
Gave them the chance toÂ 
Â 
a) show Jon's emerging leadership abilities, and justify his increasing popularity with younger members of the NW
b ) flesh out Jojen and Bran's storyline, and show Bran's developing abilities
c) give Burn Gorman more screentime
Â 
All in all, one of the best changes they've made IMO.


Â 
Agreed on one of the best changes, which, for me, is extremely impressive, since I've liked almost all of their changes except the beast Qhorin Halfhand scene from the books being not as clear as it was in ACoK. That one still makes me angry occasionallyÂ

3740	Rockroi	2014-05-07	Bran and his group had a fuck ton of character development in that episode.Â 
Â 

Â 
Actually hardly any. Â Ban was upset because he had just been captured- something we see once season at this rate. Â Jojen explained more of the Supernatural element of everything ... actually., no he didn't. Â He actually merely repeated lines that Bran had already seen in his own vision; Jojen told us nothing we did not already know about Bran. Â Jojen did say he has the Green sight, something he could have said- literally- at any moment during the last season and a half; would have taken all of 8 maybe 10 seconds. Â Thankfully, there was a walking cliche there to say "Hey, I saw you die" so there was that. Â 
Â 
Bran: chooses his mission over his brother, wargs into another human being and forces him to kill someone
Â 

Â 
We already saw Bran warg into Hodor. Â We didn't see him kill anyone... but that's not character development, that's just killing somebody. Â I will readily admit that the philosophical ramifications of Bran doing this COULD be interesting. Â Don't mistake my distaste for that scene as a damnation of the ONE thing good that could come out. Â I do agree with you that Bran's future interaction with Hodor over these action could be very powerful, meaningful and deep. Â 
Â 
But there is 100% no reason for them to be at Craster's for that long-winded bait-and-switch to get us there. Â Fuck, just wander across some wildlings and you could have done the same thing. Â Maybe a 1.5 min scene.
Â 
Jojen: we see a hint about his death and understand about his green seeing more
Â 

Â 
Or... or not...Â 
Â 
Hodor: We see that Hodor is absolutely horrified to see what Bran made him do. Â I expect it to be a plot point later on
Â 

Â 
Or... or not. Â 
Â 
Bran's journey is one of my least favorite things in the books (with Mereen being dead last), but I thought this story was a great improvement over the books.
Â 

Â 
Okay, what part of that do you not realize is still filer? Â You understand what filer means, right? Filer means "Doing stuff just for the sake of doing stuff." Â And that was Sunday night. Â We could have done ALL THAT with one or two scenes, avoided the grand-stupidity of what we saw AND saved a butt-load of time (you seem to think Jojen saying "I see stuff before it happens" would have added 6 episodes to the series).
Â 
Its pretty crazy when people who defend the scene say "Its better than what was in the book" and believe that that somehow means it was not filer. Â I know it was not in the book. Â The book has a relatively tight story-line wherein the more pressing and important material is covered and a boy trudging through the snow is not. Â Simply by saying, "Look, we don't want to change the underlying story BUT we want Bran to do something.... Let's get him into a fight that does not resolve anything OTHER THAN the very fight we ourselves concocted for Bran! Â YES! Â We will... have him... just sit there and when all is said and done... NOTHING WILL CHANGE! Â My GOD! Â The scene practically writes itself." Â 
Â 
That's filer. Â 
Â 
Now, again- getting back to Hodor. Â Let's say the show adds in a very meaningful interplay between Hodor and Bran about the killing and Bran's inhumane treatment of Hodor by using Hodor as a means to an end. Â I can definitely see the value in that and the growth in Bran's characterÂ 
Â 
That's NOT filer. Â 
Â 
But you don't need to have that convoluted, nonsensical, contrived interaction at Craster's in order to get us there. Â
3741	ChrisSnow77	2014-05-07	I get it, they can't just haveÂ a season and a half of Bran & co walking through the snow starving.Â  So call it filler if you want but I think it was for a good reason.
3742	Envie	2014-05-07	Why can't it be considered filler AND good content both?
Â 
For all the arguing I've seen - overall most everyone liked the scenes added and there's another thread which the OP gave a lot of good points arguing why the scenes were good for the progression of characters on the show.Â

Just wondering, what is your actual definition of character development if it is not "revealing traits about the character through various ways that allows the audience to make their own judgments"? All of those above FIT that definition. We see them do things that they haven't done before. It's character development. Just because you don't like the storyline doesn't mean that it's not relevant. I don't like the Mereen storyline at all, but even I would admit that there is character development in it and therefore it isn't completely filler. And I don't care if it's 'filler'...it REPLACES 'filler' from the books and does it better.

3745	Fat Trell	2014-05-07	Jon Snow was picked to range with Qhorin because Jon appeared to be special at the time.
Â 
He was basically a Stark. Jon had already been handpicked to lead by Jeor. HeÂ was a competent warrior.Â He had a goddamn direwolf as a personal pet.
Â 
Qhorin choosing Jon to come on the ranging isn't an example of bad writing.
3746	wandering	2014-05-07	Yes because everything in the books is vital information that furthers the plot.

I am still saddened by the change in the Halfhand.Â  He was my fave Black Brother in the books, and I had to squint really, really hard to see any resemblance when watching his scenes.Â
3749	The Eunuch	2014-05-07	This whole conversation doesn't make any sense. This is entertainment, guys. Everything is filler.
If you want something that's not filler, I present you "Game of thrones, the movie" :
-Prologue : The King of Westeros is killed during a rebellion. His baby daughter is hidden in a foreign country.
-1st part : 15 years later... Daenerys gets dragons and wants revenge.
-2nd part : 5 years later... Ice monsters and zombies attack Westeros, while nobody in the Kingdom seems to be strong enough to resist. When everything seems to be lost, Daenerys arrives with her dragons and saves the country.
-3rd part: 1 month later... Daenerys is crowned queen of Westeros. THE END.
Now you have no "filler". I hope you enjoyed your 5 minutes movie.
I don't know about you, but I prefer a thousand-pages book and a series that last hours, with "filler" situations, characters, cities, landscape (and food) descriptions, battles, love stories, travels, plots... Because that is entertainment. And it is all these "filler" elements that make this series so enjoyable!

There will be no throne for Daenerys to be crowned on when the war is over, eunuch. The seven kingdoms, will become just that -- seven kingdoms.

3753	ground_control	2014-05-07	There is more than one type of filler. Â There's at least "we have 40 minutes of a 55 minute show and we need *something* else filler" and "we need to give these actors/characters more screen time" filler. Â I think the North scenes in the last two episodes were the latter kind of filler.
Â 
In these definitions, "filler" is more of a motivational description, not a quality description.
Â 
In terms of *quality*, I think the recent North scenes were abysmal, and almost painful to watch. Â In other words, the scenes were *filler*, but not *filling*.

I agree with this 100%, very well said Eunuch.
3755	Envie	2014-05-07	Oh I agree too with "The Eunuch" on this - I had my reservations when they announced it was being produced by HBO 4 seasons back (even though HBO has so many great series) - but they quickly proved they had the budget and casting power to create a visually entertaining 'feast' for all of us. It's obviously wildly popular and doing very well so I have no quibbles at all about 'filler' material being put into the show. There are clearly people in this debate who felt the Craster's Keep extended story arc was badly done and a terrible addition to the show but that's just their opinion as much as it's ours to argue it was 'tasty filler' instead of crap.
3756	Blazfemur	2014-05-07	the purposes of the northern scenes served as the following:
Â 
without craster's keep, we never would have witnessed the baby turn, and the social hierarchy and reveal that the leader is the nights king.
Â 
on a lesser note, Jon reunites with Ghost. however,
Â 
the purpose of the craster's keep episodes, were to show jojen dying, and give leeway into the purpose of crasters bastards (  )

Yep it is only filler to someone who has read the books and considers any 'non' book material to be filler.Â 
Â 
On the show it progressed the Bran, Jon and white Walker storylines in a meaningful way and hence was not 'filler'
3760	SlowLoras	2014-05-08	Even if it was filler - and filler needn't be aÂ bad thing if it's entertaining - it was some tasty filler indeed. Suits me just fine. Much better than 'Bran trudging endlessly through the forest while Jojen slowly dies' type filler as served by the books (I actually liked Bran's arc, but it was never going to work on TV.)
3761	Yojimbo	2014-05-08	Am sorry but the whole "Assault on Craster's Keep" was just poorly written. Look at the whole exchange between Jon and Locke with the "hounds"
Locke "There's a hut on the westside of the keep and we should stay clear of it"
Jon "Why?" (very good question John, why indeed should you stay clear of it)
Locke "They have some hounds chained up inside, the closer we can get without the hounds sniffing us out, the better" (ok fair enough point Locke, being the competent leader Jon is, he would want to minimise the risk to his men, so a nice sneaky approch will be used for the assault"
Â 
Assault scene
*The nightwatch charge in like a pack of viking raiders, alerting ever one in Craster's Keep and loses half their men in the process*Â 
*Am face palming the whole time and thinking "why would any one at the nightwatch want Jon as the lord commander, I would rather have Sam's socks in charge than tvs "no nothing Jon Snow"*
*Not to mention after the fighting is done, no one seems to care there is no hounds, no one asks "where are these hounds Locke was talking about?", no one asks crasters wives "where are the hounds in the hut?", craster wives don't say "there no hounds in the hut, just some prisoners, a giant of a man, and three highborn kids one of them being a cripple" Nope, all we get is, "We are going to make our own way Lord Crow, now burn done the keep and let ever whitewalker and wildling in the north see a nice burning fire*
Â 
The only thougths I got out of Craster's Keep arc was, "Hmmmm, D&D claim they got to cut characters out the story because of show time restriction, but they are more than happy to dish out 40 minutes or poorly written filler tripe"

Â You may have thought it was poorly written, which is debatable. But the fact is that this is the biggest action Jon has taken on the show to justify being voted LC.
Â 
He led a successful raid that killed all the mutineers and avenged the death of Mormont and personally killed the ringleader. You can easily see his actions being spoken of approvingly by the rest of the nights watch and that, combined with the fact he is a bastard Stark, makes it feasible they would elect him.
Â 
It is also a big development for the character who has gone from a emo boy looking gormlessly at Ygritte to a leader of men.
Â 
You may not like the scenes but what, aside from the fact it is not in the books, makes it filler?

3765	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-08	When did Jon or Locke or any of them say that the plan was to sneak in and attack the mutineers? Waiting for cover of night doesn't mean that you're going for stealth, just that you'd prefer they didn't see you approach until you meant to be seen. Avoiding a pack of hounds seems like a logical thing to do, whether you're going in sneakily or not.Â And since we hear the mutineers yellingÂ beforeÂ Jon and the rest of the guys have started their attack, perhaps they were even spotted on their approach...?Â 
Â 
Seems to me they were itching for a fight, and had a score to settle, though. Don't see the issues of logic here.Â

Â 
Ok then and after the fight? Not one member of the nights watch thought, "I wonder why I can't hear barking? I wonder why the traitors never unleashed the hounds? Ok, if there are no hounds, why did Locke say there was?". Whats more how did Jon prove himself as leadership material? Going out with 10 men and coming back with 5, when the nigths watch are already pressed for men and will need ever single one for the coming conflict. Oh that right they where, as you say, iching for a fight, to hell with the bigger picture, it not like a leader needs that as a virtue..................he just needs to charge in and almost get killed by a lowborn from flea bottom, perfect leadership material if I ever saw it...........................
3767	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-08	You seem to have missed the whole point of going back to the keep in the first place, which tells me that you weren't paying much attention. And since we barely saw any of the aftermath, I think it's a little early to assume that we've heard the last about Locke (though I wouldn't expect much more than a passing mention). Do they need to explain to us that Jon now understands that Locke was lying? Are we not able to assume as much, based on the fact that he knows there were no hounds chained up at the keep?Â 
Â 
Jon proved himself a leader because he was willing to undertake a dangerous mission with the best interests of the Night's Watch in mind, while simultaneously avenging Commander Mormont. You just seem to be taking incidents in isolation, and ignoring the context of what has previously been established in the show.Â

3769	Joseph Nobles	2014-05-08	Why didn't the Night's Watch wonder where the hounds were? Maybe when a giant direwolf walked up and greeted Jon, they thought that's what Locke wasÂ on about.
3770	DaveyJoe	2014-05-08	Not too mention they're all hopped on adrenaline after being in a fight and killing a bunch of men. Â We have the luxury of hindsight and are able to reflect on all of the details while these men are in the heat of the moment, a chaotic moment, and their blood is up.

Â 
You mean the whole weak plot line of not allowing the wildlings finding out about the nightswatch actual strength? Pray tell, how would it make the situation there in any worse if Mance actually found out? What because Mance now knows they have around 100-200 men instead of a 1000 he now has the keys to victory? Infact isn't that the whole idea behind the raiding party? That Mance doesn't have to use his main force to break through the tunnel because he knows it would cost his wildlings too many lives, but if he sends a small raiding force to take Castle Black unawares then he and his wildling horde can just march through the tunnel unopposed?Â 
Or do you mean the other can of worms the writers opened up when they decided Sam couldn't keep his mouth shut and he spilled the beans to Jon that Bran is still alive? So Sam and Jon are looking over a map and Jon deduces the only place Bran could possibly go for shelter beyound the Wall is Craster's Keep?
Â 
Or the fact that Jon has to prove his leadership qualities at all? Because the writer's decided for the last 3 seasons "Jon Snow knows nothing"? Infact isn't Jon going to prove his quilty when he defends Castle Black from the wildling raiding party attack to open the tunnel? Oh never mind, because the writers decided to open another can of worms when they saw fit to have Alliser and Janos show up to Castle Black before the wildling suprise attack took place.
The writers of the show have decided to write themselves into this mess and now they are doing a poor job of writing themselves out of it. The "butterfly effect" that is taking place, I've got say, is a very nice sight to see though

But then again what do I know right? Am the one who is not paying attention..............

Â 
And in the book, about 30 crippled or young men were able to defend the Wall against Mance Rayder's Army. Â Mance knows that even a few men can defend against thousands of foes; if he thinks that there are 1,000 men, he's going to wait until he's sure he has an advantage by coming up with different plans of attack, which gives the NW time to plead for help from the rest of Westeros and fortify their defenses. Â If he knows that there's only about 100, he will strike sooner and that gives them less time.
Â 
The writers of the show know what they are doing.

Â 
And why is there only around 30 men to defend Castle Black tunnel? That right, because Bowen Marsh (who sadly seems to have been cut from the show since the 1st season) as acting Lord Commander take all the able bodied men to West Watch because Mance tricks them into thinking that where the main force of Mance is going to attack. Leaving Castle Black under maned making it possible for the raiding party to take the tunnel, but Jon was able to stop that from happening, forcing Mance to attack. Again, just another minior change by opmitting Bowen Marsh, lending to vastly different consequences.

The raiding party is still going to attack.
Â 
Ygritte will still die.
Â 
Mance Rayder is still going to attack.
Â 
Stannis is still going to sweep in and save the day.
Â 
Jon will still be elected Lord Commander.
Â 
Jon will still be stabbed.
Â 
So, what are these 'vastly different' consequences you speak of?

My arguement is not that the show has changed any major plot points (even though it going to happen, less you think George is going to allow the show to spoil major plot points before the books) it that the events leading up to these major plot points have been changed, and IN MY OPINION the writers have done a poor job at it.

The writers of the show have decided to write themselves into this mess and now they are doing a poor job of writing themselves out of it. The "butterfly effect" that is taking place, I've got say, is a very nice sight to see though 
Â 
But then again what do I know right? Am the one who is not paying attention..............


Â 
Jon says himself, "Mance has all he needs to crush us - he just doesn't know it yet." What he's saying is that they need time. The men need to be further trained, the defenses need to be shored up, and a plan needs to be implemented. Mance already has the key to his victory, essentially, but there's a big difference in how to approach this battle if the Watch has 1,000 men versus 100 men. We can assume Mance doesn't want thousands upon thousands of his people to die, if it can be avoided.Â 
Â 
Also, you don't have Mance's tentative plan right. The plan for the raiding party isn't "to take Castle Black" in the show. The force isn't large enough. Based on what has been presented, it seems to me that his plan is to arrange his army near the Wall, and light "the biggest fire the north has ever seen" in order to focus the attention of the Watch away from the south. Which is why both raiding parties have had a warg with them; so that the bird can alert the raiding party to make their assault from the south, with the obvious intention of catching the Watch unaware and opening the gate from their side. With Jon having escaped, the plan was altered, which is why the wildlings are attempting to draw the Night's Watch out of Castle Black by attacking villages south of the Wall. The overall plan seems to be the same.Â 
Â 
And Jon doesn't deduce that Bran is, in fact, at Craster's Keep. Just that it is the only place they could logically have found shelter, since the rest of the wildling villages are abandoned (which has been mentioned several times). If Sam traveled south from Craster's and ended up at the Nightfort, an obvious assumption could be made that Bran and his party might run into the keep by traveling north along that same path. Neither one is sure, or even alludes to truly believing that Bran could be there, based on the dialogue. Jon may have, in some ways, hopedÂ that he was, but none of his actions or dialogue make it seem like he was counting on it.Â 
Â 
As for Jon beginning to show the men of the Watch that he could be a suitable leader... Your complaints here don't really make sense (shocker). Leading the assault on Craster's Keep quite clearly displays his leadership qualities in a way that makes his election believable. It's a progression. One moment at the gate is enough, in your eyes? Because, for the past two seasons (for the most part) Jon has been with the wildlings. ...I mean, this is self-explanatory. Saying that there's no need to show Jon blossoming into a true leader is just silly.Â 
Â 
Thorne & Slynt being present provides some much needed conflict and dramatic tension. Getting more screen-time for these two doesn't seem like a bad idea at all, in my eyes. And it certainly doesn't create any mess. The context of the show is independent of that of the novels, so it seems to me that your complaints mostly stem from trying to apply the logic of one scenario onto a (mostly) different scenario entirely.Â
3781	Arkash	2014-05-08	Yes, and Jon lose's his Lord Commander materialship moment because it going to be Alliser leading the watch, not him.
Â 

Â 
I'm quite sure Alisser will die during the battle and will be the one to say "The Wall is yours" to Jon who will then lead the defense.

We can assume Mance doesn't want thousands upon thousands of his people to die, if it can be avoided.
Â 

Â 
1000 men or 100 men the only way Mance is getting through that wall is through the tunnel, how much time does the Night Watch need to work this out? Not like they been there as a order for 3000 yea............never mind. How much training does the night watch need to drop barrels of ice and stones of the top of the Wall? But of cource am edging my bets that the Night Watch will do a "300" stand off in the tunnel and get saved by Stannis in the nick of time. And your quite right Mance (book and show) doesn't want thousands and thousands of his people to die, just book Mance had no choice when the raiding party failed.
Â 
Also, you don't have Mance's tentative plan right. The plan for the raiding party isn't "to take Castle Black" in the show. The force isn't large enough.

The overall plan seems to be the same.
Â 

Â 
Sorry I forgot, the Brothers of the Nights Watch have the mentalities of moths right? Can see it now;
Â 
Sam: "Maester Aemon you should see the fire the wildlings have lit! It the biggest the North has ever seen!"
Aemon "My nephew would have loved this..........."
Sam: "Maester Aemon?" *Sam turns around to see Ygritte pulling her axe out of Maester Aemons head*
Â 
What's more don't you think Mance, you know a former Brother, wouldn't think the remaining brothers at Castle Black will be defending that gate to the tunnel more tightly than "Cersia guards her ****"? What does he think 20 (say 50 now that the cannibles have shown up) are going to really do except get butchered?
Â 
And Jon doesn't deduce that Bran is, in fact, at Craster's Keep. Just that it is the only place they could logically have found shelter, since the rest of the wildling villages are abandoned (which has been mentioned several times).

Jon may have, in some ways, hopedÂ that he was, but none of his actions or dialogue make it seem like he was counting on it.
Â 

Â 
Where did I say Bran is at Crasters Keep? Jon thinks he may have gone there for shelter, you would at least think Jon would have asked one of crasters wives if they have possibly seen three children and a giant of a man...........no we get............we make our own way in this waste land.............and...............burn it down
Â

Â 

Â 
Yes, by showing the watch that only losing 5 men, to the 10-15 men at Craster Keep, is in the same league as, holding of a attack of 200 wildlings by mustering up a defenese of the young, old and crippled. And hell in the books that was still not enough to swing things in Jon's favour. And am not saying they shouldn't show Jon blossoming into a true leader, am saying the show has not shown it enough.
Â

Â 

Â

3784	Fat Trell	2014-05-09	Filler, in the context of an adaptation,Â is additional material that exists outside the story arc to pad out source material.
Â 
It is not simply show time where the plot isn't moving forward.
Â 
aFfC, aDwD, "The Fly" from Breaking Bad are not examples of filler. They are source material. If you want to argue they are non-pertinent parts of their narratives that's a different discussion.

Â Agreed the requirements of the show are to make Jon Snow a believable LC. A successful raid on Craster's keep, which killed all the mutineers is a start in this. They don't have to follow every narrative step in the books, just end up at the same destination.
Â 
Now when the wall is under attack and Thorne perhaps wounded or dead it will seem natural for Jon to step in to lead the defence.
Â 
It all begins with Craster's keep which is why it is certainly not filler but the first stepÂ to achieve the same eventual outcome as in the books. I do wish book purists wouldn't call any change to the source material 'filler'.

Â 
On that note...
Keep calm.
3788	Miodrag	2014-05-09	Yeah, I already talked about this, but as a film major (and a human being) I'm seriously shell-shocked at Miodrag's argument. I mean, rarely do I see someone being so wrong about something and refusing to accept it. And the sheer hyperbole of it: calling it a blasphemy (really?) and saying that no one has ever done it before (even if that editing technique is literally used in virtually every action sequence).Â 
Â 
But I'll let it go, even if Miodrag won't (seriously, this was more than two seasons ago, get over it!). There are lots of other things to nitpick about this show, and this isn't even a nitpick


Â 
Believe me, I'm even more shocked that you, as a film major, can't tell the difference between those two scenes and special effects. What's more, you're trying to say that I'm complaining about any speeding up or slowing down of a footage, which is a poor manipulation of my words. Am I complaining about Bran's visions? Of course not. Because, there's nothing to complain about - even though the same editing technique is used for Bran's visions. But, instead of thinking about what could be the possible difference between using the technique for Bran's visions and using it for the concealing of poor choreography, you go on and on about how shocked you are at my arguments. And you're shocked not only as a film major, but also as a human being, and yet, you found it fit to accuse me for a hyperbole!
Â 
For the record: the only reason for speeding up the fight footage was to conceal bad choreography! If editors/D&D thought the choreography was satisfying, they wouldn't speed it up. Why they didn't use the same "technique" for other fight scenes? Because they weren't unsatisfied with the footage. And it doesn't necessarily mean the Ned/Jaime footage was bad really. But, the editors/D&D obviously thought it should've been better or more exciting, and tried to "improve" it - by speeding up the footage and hoping the viewers aren't going to notice it.
Â 
Had anything like that happened in The Sopranos or The Wire or True Detective or Breaking Bad (which also manipulated the speed in some action sequences, but never in the "hopefully viewers won't notice it" sense), or in any other respectable TV or film production, someone would be fired.
Â 


I'm not a big fan of the show and I give it a lot of flack myself but, good lord, this is probably the most ridiculous complaint I've ever read about anything, seriously.
Fight scenes are by definition illusions, they are designed, choreographed and edited to trick the audience into thinking there's an actual fight going on and not two stunt guys hitting each other with foam swords. If they need to speed up the scene a little to make Sean Bean look like a competent fighter, who the hell cares?
There's a lot to criticize about the show but speeding up literally a tenth of a second of a fight scene to make it more exciting is not one of those things.


Â 
That's the thing: the scene possibly looks more exciting only if you don't notice the speeding up. Once a viewer notices what they did, the scene just can't look like an actual fight any more, and Sean Bean doesn't look like a competent fighter any more. That is not to be confused with a special effect. And the amount has nothing to do with it. Again, Bran's visions are also sped up, the entirety of them, but there is no problem, precisely because the continuity isn't broken. These two scenes I complain about are an entirely different case. When you speed up only some parts of the footage, you inevitably break the continuity. You can do that for, say, artistic reasons, just like it's done sometimes, and it doesn't mean the credibility (for lack of a better word) was broken, because viewers are supposed to realize what you did and enjoy the artistic value of your decision. That's what Chinese directors do with fight scenes all the time. There's a borderline case: what Cameron did in Terminator 2 - those fights between two terminators are all speed up, but: 1) the action itself is supposed to be inhuman because it involves superb fighting machines, and 2) the entire action is sped up, because otherwise it would look unacceptably clumsy and it would break the continuity and credibility of viewing experience. However, if one does that GoT style, meaning, just to "improve" the effect parts of the recorded action are supposed to have on viewers, then it's messing with continuity and credibility of the viewing experience.
Â 
Regardless of how many film majors and professional video editors here claim it's a standard technique, the fact remains they aren't able to provide any example of a respectable production that done what GoT did.
Â 


For the record, I am a professional video editor and this argument is total nonsense.


Â 
For the record: total nonsense is the comparison you made, between the scenes I'm complaining about and "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"/"The Lord of the Rings". Especially if you're a professional video editor, you should've never make that comparison. Because, whether in agreement or disagreement with me over GoT scenes, a professional editor would immediately see the essential difference between those scenes and examples you provided.
Â 
Oh, and, here's some free advise about GoT editing you defend so aggressively: don't ever do that in a serious production in real life, because you'll only loose the job.
Â 


"Against" the viewers?Â  What on earth are you talking about?Â  Why would anybody care about using editing to create an impression, and why would that be any different from any other effect?Â  Because the sacredness of "the screen"?
Â 
I criticize this show plenty on my own, so I'm far from an automatic defender of it.Â  But this is one of the silliest criticism I have ever seen, not just about this show, but about any show.


Â 
Yes, screen is the separate entity from the material you're watching via screen. You see, screen is for visual material what page is for books.
Â 
Â 
David Selig,
Â 
I'm done here. Don't want you to have a heart attack or something.

Â 
You're missing the point - they've already changed relatively big plot points. One big plot point was that Mance tricked Bowen Marsh into taking the Night's Watch forces in the wrong direction, leaving the Night's Watch in a far weaker position. But Jon's leadership allows them to defeat the raiding party.Â 
Â 
In the show, the NW is still going to defeat the raiding party... but it will be under very different circumstances.

Fly is one of Breaking Bad's most critically acclaimed episodes, even if it was not exactly popular with the audience. It's a bottle episode, but I wouldn't necessarily call it filler.

Â 
FlyÂ is a fantastic episode. And yeah, it's pure filler. Just shows you what a loaded term that is. Best drop it.
3791	DaveyJoe	2014-05-09	For the record: total nonsense is the comparison you made, between the scenes I'm complaining about and "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"/"The Lord of the Rings". Especially if you're a professional video editor, you should've never make that comparison. Because, whether in agreement or disagreement with me over GoT scenes, a professional editor would immediately see the essential difference between those scenes and examples you provided.
Â 
Oh, and, here's some free advise about GoT editing you defend so aggressively: don't ever do that in a serious production in real life, because you'll only loose the job.


Â 
Ang Lee sped up the shot of Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi twirling around as a means of manipulating the screen to fool the audience into thinking those moves were faster than they were when filmed. Â It's the same exact technique used in the Ned Stark/Jaime fight. Â Thanks, but I'm doing perfectly fine in my career without taking advice from somebody on the internet who has no idea what they're talking about. Â In fact, I'm accepting an award next month, and that after years of manipulating the screen to fool the audience without "loosing" a job.

Ang Lee sped up the shot of Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi twirling around as a means of manipulating the screen to fool the audience into thinking those moves were faster than they were when filmed.


Â 
is a complete nonsense, because you're forgetting Lee not only sped-up some parts of the scene, but also slowed-down some other parts. Practically, that fight scene is made of parts that are either sped-up or slowed-down. According to your logic, by slowing down some parts Lee wanted to fool audience into... what exactly?!
Â 
Actually, Lee doesn't try to hide the technique from the audience. He's really not trying to fool anybody. It takes a moron to think actual fights look like the one we're watching in Lee's movie. He wasn't trying to depict realism. And that's the whole difference. Yeah, both Lee and GoT were using the same technique, but Lee used it for artistic impression, while D&D used it to increase the excitement in a supposedly realistic scene. If you want to continue with comparing the two, while accusing myself of "having no idea what I'm talking about", perhaps it would help if you have an idea what you're talking about.
Â 
As for your award - congratulations, honestly. Win a hundred more, for all I care. Your aggressive need to defend GoT's embarrassments is what troubles me, not your professional success.
3793	Rockroi	2014-05-09	Name a show that doesn't have filler...I'll waitÂ Â  
Even Breaking Bad, almost universally recognized as the pinnacle of TV excellence, had filler EPISODE--not justÂ scenes. "The Fly"...BRUTAL.Â 
I personally like that D&D wrap up certain unfinished business in the books, I.E., Robert's bastards, Crasters, etc.Â 
IMO, filler is okay, so long as it's of the entertaining variety.Â 
Â 
Â 

Â 
Deadwood. Â The Wire. Â Rome. Â Hardly any filler.
Â 
Your example of the Fly episode of Breaking Bad is wrong. Â This is not a BB post, so I don't want to get into it, but the fact that you think the Fly episode was "filer" hows you don't know what filer is. Â Or you didn't know what was going on in BB. Â Either way, its not helpful. Â 
Â 
Now, in shows (like the ones I mentioned above) was there SOME filer? Â Yeah, probably and I bet I didn't like it (Deadwood's closest brush with filer was the Brian Cox acting company and that provided some cultural context of the world of 1878).
Â 
And filer IS NOT merely stuff that was not in the books. Â Filer is material that does not advance the underlying story-line or narrative. Â And even THEN I can swallow some filer if its done well. Â Nothing at Craster's was done well that involved Bran. Â Bran's inclusion made no sense, Locke's reaction to Bran made no sense, looking for Bran at Craster's made no sense, Locke's plan to get Bran OUT of the North makes no sense; Ghost being there makes no sense; the fact that the women who were rescued make NO MENTION of the three high-born kids they had and the GIANT that they LITERALLY HAD CHAINED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YARD!Â 
Â 
BUT... the argument is "But I LIKED IT! Â So it was GOOD!" Â No. Â I like ice cream to; its still not something to make a whole meal out of (or clam-less clam chowder for all of you who can follow).Â 
Â 
In the book, Bran does very little and because they tossed out CH (for whatever reason) the writers feel like they had to do SOMETHING! Â And if we know one thing from season 4 its that the Showrunners are more embolden now to go more and more off-script. Â And with mixed results AT BEST (this is what happens when people start believing their own press; they start having Jaime rape Cersei and having very bad scenes at Craster's). Â And to a degree, its understandable as AFfC is a terrible book. Â 
Â 
My counter? Scrap Bran. Â he already looks ridiculous (sorry, the actor looks like he's 19). Â You have him get to where he needs to go and replace the actor in a few years; right when Bran matters again (whenever that may be). Â Or, give hima Â worthwhile story. Â Either way, stop using the geographic method of story-telling (Well, the characters are close by so lets put a story together with them). Â That's bad story-telling....Â 
Â 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Â 
Â 
Okay so... let me come back around and give an addition to the "Pro-Craster Scene" argument. Â 
Â 
First, we have Jon's development as a leader, which I think is vastly overblown. Â HE so going to still lead the Wall in a few episodes; you don's need the silliness we saw. Â There is also the Hodor story-line which could make for some compelling discussion and TV viewing (Or... or not, as I have said). Â 
Â 
But there is a third. Â 
Â 
I spoke to a friend last evening about the episode; before we spoke, he actually liked the episode. Â After? Â While he did not come right out and say the episode was bad, the things I said above gave him pause and he was re-evaluating how he felt. Â BUT, during the talk he did discuss something he observed in the episode that I had glossed over. Â And its something to consider in this discussion.
Â 
When Bran sees Jon and Jojen advises him of how Jon will react, Bran has to made a very tough, very big decision. Â And its, possibly, the first time Bran has had to make such a tough decision. Â In fact, its possibly the first real decision Bran has made in the series so far. Â Bran has to decide to reunite with Jon OR continue to go it alone. Â And Bran decides. Â 
Â 
Its interesting when you think about Bran and how similar he is to Sansa - both are relatively helpless in where they are: Sansa is in the belly of the beast at KL and now with LF; Bran is a cripple who has little say in his life. Â Sansa had no say or hand in what is happening at KL; no say in Ned's death, Joff's death; no say in her own marriage; no say in her own escape. Â Bran did not make any decisions after he awoke; he had no say in Robb leaving, in Ned leaving, in Cat leaving; he was lord of WF for such a short time before Theon dropped a load in the middle of the courtyard. Bran had no say in Maester Lewin's life or death; he had no say in his escape from WF. Â Even Maester advises Osha to hide from Bran the identity of the crofter's boys who were slain to hide Bran's "escape." Â 
Â 
Even when Bran is out of WF- he has no real decisions to make: he is on the lamb. Â Its only in warging that he can take some control over his life, and even there is reminded how much he should NOT do that. Â Even his decision to rescue Jon is muted. Â HE has little, if any, say in his parting with Rickon, just as Sansa has no say in her parting with Arya. Â 
Â 
When Bran sees Jon at Craster's its an emotional moment for him (here let me add: it SHOULD have been an emotional moment for the audience, but the writers did such a terrible job, few here barely noticed it). But the upside is that Bran made a choice and he made it for all the right reasons. Â 
Â 
But ....
Â 
For starters, as I stated, this was such a powerful moment that even here on this thread, the scene's most ardent defenders failed to take any notice of it. Â Second, Bran ALREADY MADE this decision when Sam found him on the Wall; Bran chose to go ahead and not go back with Sam. Â So in many ways, we didn't need to see any of that at Craster's; we already saw that scene already. Â IN fact, in the books, Bran's decision plays far better and is clearer than in the show. Â 
Â 
That's the best I can do in defending that terrible, cliche, contrived scene. Â
3794	Raffles	2014-05-09	My counter? Scrap Bran. Â he already looks ridiculous (sorry, the actor looks like he's 19). Â You have him get to where he needs to go and replace the actor in a few years; right when Bran matters again (whenever that may be).Â 


Â 
I'd agree with that. He looked about 25 years old the way he was laying there with his long legs sticking out! It's a shame he's grown so tall.. but to be fair, he did look like he would be short in stature as he aged, when he was first cast.

Â 
Sorry, I have to ask, are you suggesting they should... plan?! Like, make plans? Long-term plans? In advance?
Â 
But, that is not good television. Good TV means: no planing at all, unreasonable sub-plots, meaningless dialogues, beautiful actors that aren't necessarily good in their job but they nevertheless get overpayed for few scenes per season (that's what passes for character development these days), overused soundtrack, clumsy choreography, and, above else, constant whining about how hard it is to make the show. That is what good TV is, mister! Not your glorified planing!

Seven Samurai by Akira Kurosawa, in this action scene you can see several shots that have been sped up, no slow motion either, this technique is used to make the action seem faster:

I can't find a clip of the fight as it appeared in the movie, but if you've seen it, you know they sped it significantly.

Â 
To have him showcase all his leadership skills in one battle would be a bit daft - especially when last season saw him out of his depth, being constantly reminded of how little he knows. IMO it's more organic to have the fact presented to us before the wall - and solidified during that battle. Nobody can say it was a fluke, he's led a successful battle twice. (This happens in the book too - only with wildling skirmishes instead of mutineers.)

Â 
About Seven Samurai clip, I didn't see any speeding-up. Perhaps I missed it, but then again, those guiding captions don't mention it either. It's all about cutting and editing, nothing about undercranking. And besides, we're talking about 60 years old movie - even if there are sped-up (undercranked) parts in it, Kurosawa still did a better job than a 21th century production worth dozens of millions, because his sped-up shots are at least not jarring enough for me to spot it right away.
Â 
As for other examples, they're all taken from martial arts flicks. Definitely not something that is regarded as serious productions. And, once more, it seems they've done better job than GoT, because at least they used an audience as a background in order to strengthen the sense of unbroken continuity, while in GoT those Ned's and Brienne's swings look jarringly discontinuous to the rest of scenes. Speaking of examples, already mentioned Terminator 2 is an interesting case, because Cameron didn't try to hide the footage is sped-up: he probably didn't have to, since the fight isn't supposed to be entirely realistic. But, as far as I can remember, there was one tiny shot with a compromised continuity because of speeding-up. Like, while two machines are fighting, humans standing in background can be seen, and moves of those humans look unnaturally rapid. Can't be certain, but I think it's in one of Terminator movies, and my bet would be on the second one. It was more than 20 years ago, but I seem to remember it was brought up in film courses I attended at the time.
Â 
The piece you linked contains the line I find crucial:
Â 
Generally, the frame rate isn't lowered to less than 21 frames per second, as anything beyond this makes the effect too glaring.
Â 
Underlined part is the essence of my complaint: this technique is to be used only when the effect isn't going to be too glaring. Meaning, it will either not break the continuity (for example, car chases), or the breaking of continuity is irrelevant because of artistic reasons ("Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", "Hero", "House of Flying Daggers" and other Oriental movies that aren't marshal-arts flicks). What GoT did is the opposite, because it can't help but break the continuity. Those sped-up swings do stand out, and not in a good way.
Â 
Anyway, looks like editors/D&D learned their lesson, because after Season 2, they didn't speed up any footage, even though they had a number of opportunities for that.

Â 
And who where the ones who wrote Jon into this this situation? That they had to make a ham fisted attempt of Jon actually having to do something because as you said, all we got last season was "you know nothing Jon Snow".
Â 
And to compare muntineers attack with the Battle for Castle Keep. Honestly lets break it down;
Â 
Mutineers Attack 
Â 
Â Jon wants to go clear out Craster's Keep because "OMG WHAT HAPPENS IF MANCE FINDS OUT OUR ACTUAL NUMBERS! WE ARE DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDD!"
Alliser says No............... (wow some one actually giving a order, to bad it not Jon)
Alliser has a change of heart, when Janos thinks this will be a good way of getting rid of Jon. Alliser gives Jon permission to ask for volunteers, (remember the number because it a nice shining example of how "good" this shows writing is) who are Grenn, Edd, Locke and three other random Brothers, so six volunteers and Jon are going to Craster's Keep. (yes the hallmarks of a good leader is asking, not telling..........)
Next time we see the Brothers is when Locke is infiltrating the camp to find out they have no guards posted, most of them are already drunk, there are 11 mutineers and there is a "hut with a pack of hounds they should stay clear off" (would have been nice to assume Jon give Locke the order to go scout, but it could have been Moon Boy for all we know)
Next thing we see is a full frontal assault lead by Jon (omg Jon is actually leading at something), against a foe who out numbers them (ohhhhhhhhh  )
Jon get into a "boss fight", almost dies and is saved by the help of one of Craster Wives (I can see why Alliser doesn't want show Jon training the recruits now)
After the "battle" Jon finds out they have lost 4 Brothers, only to find out from Edd it 5 (yes such great writing they can't even get a single digit number straight between two episodes  ), He also counts they have killed 10 of the 11 muntiners. (Not bad Jon only losing 2/3 of your men against a group of men who where drunk and you had the element of suprise on and who is the Wight? Grenn or Edd..........  )
Next we see Jon asking Crasters wives if they want to come to Castle Black with them
They say No............they would rather make their own way in this barren frozen waste land and they want the keep burned down (Jon thinks this is a spiffing plan and goes along with it)
Yep I can see Jon is just oozing leadership material, give that man a talking raven already and make him Lord Commander

I must be watching GOT wrong, I watch to be entertained and follow the story, sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised,  sometimes I'm not overwhelmed. It must be exhausting having to watch and scrutinise every single scene. Do you receive some sort of qualification at the end of the series, like an A level in game of thrones?

Â 
Pretty much with you on this. It's entertainment. It's fun. It doesn't all have to mean something deep and profound. Jon's a kid out of his depth learning how to lead men, and how to fight outside of the training yard. I think the scene pretty much expressed those things. Therefore, it worked for me.

Am sorry I thought this forums was a place for discussion and debate, not just a place where fans can come to scream about "omg I love khaleesi and her dragons!". And yes I watch this show to be entertained aswell, I was not entertained, here are the reason why I was not entertained, I've already been accused in this thread of "not even paying attenion to the show" and now am be accused of "over scruntinsing" it? Maybe from now on this forum should should only allow members to post a question as thread titles, and all other members are only allowed to write "Yes" or "No" in response........................better yet I think I will just not use that muscle known as the "brain" when I watch this show from now on. Then all I will care about is when I see tits, blood, swords and dragons.....................or maybe not.

And yes I watch this show to be entertained aswell, I was not entertained, here are the reason why I was not entertained, I've already been accused in this thread of "not even paying attenion to the show" and now am be accused of "over scruntinsing" it? Maybe from now on this forum should should only allow members to post a question as thread titles, and all other members are only allowed to write "Yes" or "No" in response........................better yet I think I will just not use that muscle known as the "brain" when I watch this show from now on. Then all I will care about is when I see tits, blood, swords and dragons.....................or maybe not.


Â 
the thing is, there's thinking about the show & analysing the scenes, and then there's picking the show apart stitch by stitch, and to me this thread seems a case of the latter, at least from a few posters - and I mean that on both the 'pro' and 'anti' side. Nothing wrong with thinking about a show & discussing it, but there comes a point where it gets overly pedantic. Just saying.
3807	Uldra I	2014-05-09	Â 
You mean the whole weak plot line of not allowing the wildlings finding out about the nightswatch actual strength? Pray tell, how would it make the situation there in any worse if Mance actually found out? What because Mance now knows they have around 100-200 men instead of a 1000 he now has the keys to victory? Infact isn't that the whole idea behind the raiding party? That Mance doesn't have to use his main force to break through the tunnel because he knows it would cost his wildlings too many lives, but if he sends a small raiding force to take Castle Black unawares then he and his wildling horde can just march through the tunnel unopposed?Â 
Or do you mean the other can of worms the writers opened up when they decided Sam couldn't keep his mouth shut and he spilled the beans to Jon that Bran is still alive? So Sam and Jon are looking over a map and Jon deduces the only place Bran could possibly go for shelter beyound the Wall is Craster's Keep?
Â 
Or the fact that Jon has to prove his leadership qualities at all? Because the writer's decided for the last 3 seasons "Jon Snow knows nothing"? Infact isn't Jon going to prove his quilty when he defends Castle Black from the wildling raiding party attack to open the tunnel? Oh never mind, because the writers decided to open another can of worms when they saw fit to have Alliser and Janos show up to Castle Black before the wildling suprise attack took place.
The writers of the show have decided to write themselves into this mess and now they are doing a poor job of writing themselves out of it. The "butterfly effect" that is taking place, I've got say, is a very nice sight to see though 
Â 
But then again what do I know right? Am the one who is not paying attention..............


 Â Â 
Once again going to start with the statement, I sincerely love the shows. The writers, cast, crew, artists, directors.... everyone involved with the shows have done an amazing job!Â  Can't even imagine how they do it all.Â  'Brilliant' is the word that comes to mind when I think of all the amazing talents that have lent their hands to the production of the entire series.Â  Also realizing there are changes that have to happen because of the difference in mediums.Â  IMO until the last two episodes, the changes seemed necessary and wise, but not ones that really change Martin's story too much.Â Â  My apologies, because I promised I'd not speak about this again, but I just can't help myself.
Â 
Realizing that most people who post on internet forums are much younger than I am, I suppose the action scenes would probably suit their tastes better than intrigue and character development so I can somewhat understand the overwhelming love of the Craster's Keep scenes in the last two episodes.Â  The more blood and sexual violence the better, right?Â Â Â  OTOH,Â In the books Coldhands is a much beloved and very mysterious figure.Â  He was our first realÂ introduction to "others". Â  There could have been a couple of interesting scenes with him to flesh out the Bran arc a little.Â  CH could have even included the scene where he killed the mutineers (who are wights by then) in an off the scene moment from the books, & there would be the fight with the wights in order to get Bran into the cave... a very exciting scene, but didn't include rape or even nudity, a limitation for some, I know.Â  Jon has lots of negotiating and relationship building to do at the wall.Â  There are lots of things in the books that could make this storyline interesting enough for the show... still no violence or even nudity,Â  sorry to say.Â  Why did D&D have to go for "filler"?.
Â Â 
Just gotta say:Â Â  If they are going to write a new story, then D&D and whoever else is in charge of the storyline should at the very least stop implying they are trying to bring GRRM's story to screen.Â  They should just change the name of the series, and give GRRM credit for being an inspiration, and go their merry way with the rest of the story.
Â Â Â 
I cannot agree that what ever they make up between the beginning and the end of GRRM's series is acceptable as long as they reach the same end point.Â  What an absurd and ridiculous argument.Â  It will not be the same story if they tell a different story. Period.Â  Not saying the show is FUBAR yet, but just saying, this kind of disregard for the original story is playing it awfully close to that edge.

I agree, but what other response could I give other than "This arc was pure filler, the writing was shit and books version was just better /thread". That would (imo) be far more unfair of a response than, the one I've given. And am glad you used the word pedantic, because this is where I feel most people who disliked this arc are coming from. It was the show writers who thought "minior" details could be changed/cut and end up at the same satisfying conclusion, the trouble is (again I can't stress this enough) imo the books did a far better job at arriveing at these conclusions because they where better written, better rationalised and felt far more organic than what the show is attempting todo. The only "sin" I think that every one in this thread is commiting (myself included) is over speculating on what future episodes will bring, just from my pov I really can't see it getting any better from the evidance I've seen from the show so far. But of course I would love to be proven wrong and my only punishment will be watching a entertaining show which I will enjoy, then again it most likely the "anti" camp will find something wrong and we will continue our head butting matchs next week

relax man it's all in good fun. but seriously, youre gona get episodes that require some time to elapse. everything cant be blackwater. this episode sets in motion (ill repeat what i posted earlier) jon reuniting with ghost, and, the reveal of the others and what they do, and their social hierarchy, and of the like. this episode had to happen, to get that inside look, at how The Others operate.
Â 
there is purpose here, it isn't filler.
Â 
now, Locke joinging the watch and then getting killed in the very. next. episode. THAT, was filler. it served no purpose as he didnt accomplish anything.
Â 
but craster's keep needed to happen. if not to reunite Ghost with Jon, but also to get an inside look at the inner working of The Others. without craster's keep, no sacrifice.

Â 
And as I said, am not having a go I was just curious. From what I've oberserved on this forum some people (from all over the camp) can be way too over sensitive with the show and books. But being as you where just having a little harmless troll, who could say they are not guilty of that (I know I couldn't  ) But being as you brought up some intresting points, let begin to bash each other over the head till one of us is right. 
Â 
Of course I am not expecting a "Black Water" ever episode and any one who would be would only be setting them selfup for disappointment. And yes, Jon reuniting with Ghost was story progession, to learn about there something more to the Others was also story progession (am not going to bring that whole debate up here). But thats it? It took almost 40min for such minior story progress, in a show that is always claimed to be striped for time, hence why they need to cut *minior* characters.
And I disagree that Locke was filler, infact that was huge character/story progression, his story is done. You can't progress a character/story any faster than that. And to me it progressed fine, he had a mission from Ross to go to the wall and find out if Jon has infomation about Bran, over hears Sam and Jon speaking about Bran (hence why he had a idea in the first place Bran was there), finds Bran, try's to take Bran and gets killed. Now the character progression is fine, the method/the way they went about it was horrible and speaks of sloppy writing. (imo ofc) Because look what had to happen in order for Locke to get killed;
Â 
Sam had to spill the beans to Jon that Bran is alive (so Sam is not just full blown caraven in the show, he can't seem to keep his mouth shut aswell, so the show writers had to take away any redeaming features from an already underdelvoped character)
Bran had to be captured by the mutineers (pure filler Bran was this entire arc, just a rehash of things we already know from last season aka Bran can wrag into Hodor, they are going north to see the three eyed raven)
Jon had to go on out to kill the mutineers, so Locke could come along (I've already covered why his explanation seems silly and pedantic already)
Snow got captured by the mutineers (never explained) just to have him meet up again with Jon (shoddy writing)
So 40mins to have a minior character die, a small bit of infomation about the Others and for Jon to meet up again with Ghost, not to mention two main characters had nothing but filler episode?Â  And people wonder why people can think this was a crap episodes/arcs and was poorly written? But it is pure speculation on my part that these two episodes where tripe because I don't see the writer fixing this in the episodes to come. Because after all, it seems to me the writer tryed to "kill to many birds with one stone" in this arc and failed at it.

Okay, this is embarrasing to ask but... where exactly is this "stop following thread" located?
3821	Uldra I	2014-05-10	oops... I meant to say "Unfollow this Topic."Â
3822	ground_control	2014-05-09	Not sure if there is a better place for it, but after rewatching this episode and having seen Stannis's Iron Bank loan application, I thought I'd share Podrick Payne's resume:
Â 
http://imgur.com/jQvfDNJ
3823	hollowcrown	2014-05-05	All in all a decent episode apart from the Mereen scene.
Â 
Â I get Emilia puts on that regal voice when being a harsh queen which we've been seeing for a while but when she's talking to her trusted advisor and good friend Jorah...can't she show a bit of emotion? A bit of humanity? She has no range and I'd really like to see some. I'm getting quite sick of shouting emotionless Daenerys.Â 
Â 
How does everyone else feel about this?
3824	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	First of all, I love your av.
Â 
Second, we're 4 seasons and IMO she peaked as an actress in season 1 and showed some flashes of being good in season 3, but to answer your question, NO.
Â 
When Danaerys came across the child on the cross on the way to Meereen, she sounded about as emotional as Stephen Hawking while depressed. She can ham it up for the crowds, but it's obvious she is indeed a stage actor and not nearly as potent on tv.

					
					
							Edited by Red Tiger, 05 May 2014 - 03:12 AM.
3825	SnowQueen232	2014-05-05	I totally agree.
If Emilia was asked to portray Daenerys like a child acting as a queen in a high school production she would be hitting the nail on the head! The 24/7 fake regality is just too much......Â 
But yes, I liked the episode too.Â
3826	Newstar	2014-05-05	Something about her reading of "as planned" was particularly awful to me. I can't even articulate why, but it was so...off. Too mannered, maybe?
3827	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-05	I agree she needs to turn it down a bit. The put on works when she's giving speeches to crowds because she's supposed to be this larger than life figure, but when she's just talking to Jorah or Barristan it's like "Chill the fuck out for a second Khaleesi, I just want to talk."
Â 
That said I don't think she's a bad actress. She was really good in season 1 and showed she knows how to play it subtle when the material is there.

3828	hollowcrown	2014-05-05	Season 1 she was great but she's been so wooden since then.
Â 
Seriously she's talking to Jorah who's been with her from S1E1, through the Dothraki Sea, the Red Wastes, Qarth, Astapor, Yunkai and Mereen. He's her most trusted advisor, can't we have some frankness, some vulnerability and uncertainty from Dany. She sounds like a bloody robot when talking to her inner council. Fair enough when she's holding court but to all her most trusted men? No way, tone it down Emilia please.
Â 
Not sure if it's her fault, the writers fault or the directors.
Â 
And yes "Just as planned" was a completely awful line.
3829	clawson24	2014-05-05	She turns an already rather grating book character into someone I just want to repeatedly punch in the face on the show. So many faux bad-ass one liners. So little range. Drives me crazy how many show watchers are in love with her.
3830	lelele	2014-05-05	kind of hammy
3831	igrewupinKL	2014-05-05	i thought she was good this episode, agree that she peaked in season 1
3832	Petyr Patter	2014-05-05	I think this was the first episode I actively hated Emilia Clarke's performance.Â  I think I can trace it to one line, "It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned."Â 
Â 
How about, "What the hell went wrong, Jorah? Did I just wage war for nothing?"Â  You know, emotion.
Â 
Even before that, there was just something stiff and forced in even the way she stood.
Â 
Honestly, I think she might have been high when she filmed this scene.Â  OK, that is probably not true, but man, Emilia is just not acting.Â  Hey, can we recast that older wife of Craster as Danaerys?Â  That woman got like three sentences and was able to sell pain, anger, regret, and resolve.Â
3833	Sun	2014-05-05	Emilia's range is about 2 cm either side of a stern look. The woman is a hopeless actress.Â
3834	hollowcrown	2014-05-05	Dany's just so unlikable and idiotic like when she started bitching out at Daario for taking Mereen's fleet. How is that a bad thing? Are they going to just leave the fleet unattended? Why would she be upset at Daario for taking a fleet for her when a fleet is what she wants and needs?
3835	graaf_x	2014-05-05	WHERE IS YOUR RANGE???
Â 
But seriously, she needs to step up, because scenes where she could simply say something badass in High Valyrian (and it would be enough for viewers) are drying up.
3836	Dany's Golden Fleece	2014-05-05	I think this was the first episode I actively hated Emilia Clarke's performance.Â  I think I can trace it to one line, "It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned."Â 
Â

Â 
Emmm I don't think Emilia writes the show.Â  Actors usually can only do was is given to them, they can suggest to the director for a different way to say a line or rewrite the line completely but director has final say usually.
3837	Roose Seal	2014-05-05	In s1 she had good material and she barely made it work. Since s2 however, her lines have ranged from horrible to horribler.Â 
Her chapters in the books are not my favorite, but i don't mind her. In the show I actively dislike her with a passion. Her face has zero expressions, she looks constantly stoned, she barely puts more expression in her delivery than Siri and her lines are just awful.
I cannot for the life of me understand how anyone can like the screen version of this character.
3838	Carl Rhaego	2014-05-05	She showed plenty emotion in season 1 when she got the chance to, so she's capable. She's just been getting shitty material since. Her dialogue feels like it was written for the trailers rather than for the scenes. In episode 4 her story got 10 minutes of screentime and she said a total of three lines, one was a 'badass' one-liner that was used in basically every trailer. I think she can play both the vulnerable, insecure Dany and the strong queen, they just have to want to show it. In the books, she still is very insecure she just puts on a facade in front of her people to appear strong. That's the Dany I like, she's very one-dimensional on the show, they are not doing the character justice.
3839	voodooqueen126	2014-05-05	Well, she is a queen, so she probably shouldn't be a wet blanket.
3840	AndrA©s Garcia	2014-05-05	She's not a great actress and she's not a horrible actress.
Â 
She's just okay. Don't expect more from her than adequacy.
3841	Nictarion	2014-05-05	I think Emilia is fine. I thought she was great in S1 & S3, S2 didn't give her very good material to work with. She's beenÂ decent so far this season imo. As far as range, some upcoming events should let her showcase more than beingÂ the stern queen, which is all we've really got so far this season.

Did you even watch S1?
3845	The hairy bear	2014-05-05	I think the main problome lies within the directors. In S1 Clarke proved that she can show some range, and appear human-like and vulnerable. The conversations with Jorah was really oddly acted, and they are making her someone really hard to relate to.
Â 
I hope that when things start going bad for her in Meeren she'll act again as the young clueless woman she is supposed to be.
3846	Velociraptor	2014-05-05	Meh, Daenerys scenes in season 3 and 4 have been just painful to watch. I didn't like her before, but now I just openly hate her character. Whenever she's speaking to someone without an army at her back or dragons by her side, I find her regal tone absolutely ludicrous. All I see is an angsty teenage girl thinking she's the queen of the world. Not sure if that's the actress' fault though. She's shown that she's capable of emotionally diverse scenes in Season 1, maybe it's just the director instructing her to speak that way, I don't know. All I know is that her scenes annoy the hell out of me whenever one comes up.Â
3847	Batman	2014-05-05	Did you even watch S1?


Â 
I liked her in season one, but that sort of kills the one liner. Also that was years ago. Al Pacino was an all time great, but recently we have "Two for the Money" and "Jack and Jill". Doesn't ruin "Godfather" but I have no hope for the future.Â
3848	MoIaF	2014-05-05	I think Emilia is fine. I thought she was great in S1 & S3, S2 didn't give her very good material to work with. She's beenÂ decent so far this season imo. As far as range, some upcoming events should let her showcase more than beingÂ the stern queen, which is all we've really got so far this season.


Â 
Emilia is a decent actress but she's not experienced enough to make crappy material seem decent. Kit has the same problem.
Â 
She absolutely has range, we've seen it before, but whatever direction they gave her this episode was off. I like Emilia and I like Dany but the tone was not right especially when Jorah gives her the news about Yunkai and Astapor.
Â 
Hopefully, she'll begin to show vulnerability again when things start going south in Meereen.
3849	Lord_Dustin	2014-05-05	I think the main problome lies within the directors. In S1 Clarke proved that she can show some range, and appear human-like and vulnerable. The conversations with Jorah was really oddly acted, and they are making her someone really hard to relate to.
Â 
I hope that when things start going bad for her in Meeren she'll act again as the young clueless woman she is supposed to be.


Â 
I think you could be on to something here. Â I have been very disappointed with aspects of Michelle MacLaren's episodes in both S3 and S4. Â So many of her scenes lack emotional depth, particularly when it comes to Dany. Â It is almost like MM has watched the Alex Graves' Dany scene from 'And Now His Watch Has Ended' too many times and is using that as a method of portraying her!
Â 
There was absolutely no conflict within Dany during the crucifixion scene. Â She seems to have lost all depth as a character, unless it is a deliberate choice to play up this aspect so that future scenes involving the dragons can bring her back down to earth?Â 
Â 
What happened to the Dany that we see in the S2 finale when she enters Drogo's tent? Â 
Â 
The highlight of the Dany scenes this season has been Grey Worm!
3850	Night's_King	2014-05-05	Emilia Clarke is Game of Thrones' Kristen Stewart.
3851	Daenerys Targaryen's slave	2014-05-05	She's not a good actor. Seems like she has to be overly dramatic even in regular situations.
3852	Rooseman	2014-05-05	I think the main problome lies within the directors.


Â 
This.
Â 
Most of the time when people blame the actors, they should really blame the director. Emilia Clarke is not too stupid to play emotion and vulnerability, but what is she supposed to do if they only give her those trailer lines and give her crappy directions on how to deliver them?

Aidan Gillen is another example of this. Everyone who has seen him in The Wire knows that he's a very capable actor and could give us a great Littlefinger if given te possibility. But since they made him talk like a mustache twirling villain, there's nothing much he can do about it.
3853	DemiNymph	2014-05-05	I've never thought she is a good actress. Pretty, but, that's it. She's lucky that Dany's character has so much going on that it can help to obscure most of the audience from her not very good acting skills.

This.
Â 
Most of the time when people blame the actors, they should really blame the director. Emilia Clarke is not too stupid to play emotion and vulnerability, but what is she supposed to do if they only give her those trailer lines and give her crappy directions on how to deliver them?

Â 
Sansa is a character who has been torment throughout the show's run. Â Her entire family (as far as she knows) is dead. Â Sophie has been given a great deal to work with. Â While she may not have been given a lot of dialogue, her character has been through hardship. Â One of the more poignant moments of this season was that 20 second clip of Sansa during the 'Purple Wedding' where the dwarf is mocking her brother to the Stark theme.
3860	MoIaF	2014-05-05	This is what D&D said about the scene:
Â 

Â 
D. B. Weiss: This scene shows Dany learning a lesson that I think all revolutionaries learned at one point or another, which is that conquering in many ways is a whole lot easier than ruling.David Beniof: This is a pivotal moment for Daenerys because for so long, her sole goal was getting back to Westeros, conquering Westeros, sitting on the Iron Throne, and becoming the queen that she believes she has every right to be. And now she has the opportunityD. B. Weiss: Sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s driven by a kind of a deep empathy â<U+0080><U+0094> a much deeper empathy than probably anybody else on the show. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s something that makes her as charismatic as she is to people because they can sense the sincerity of it. Her empathy allows her to look at the people of Westeros and say â<U+0080>Why the hell would they ever follow me if I havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t proven myself through my actions to be somebody worth following? Why would they let me rule if I hadnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t proven myself to be someone who has ruled well somewhere else?â<U+0080><U+0099>

3867	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-05-05	I think a large part of the problem is the writing. Emilia Clarke is an okay actress, she's definitely not one of the better ones on the show and they have some excellent actors on this show. But the writing for the Mereen storyline so far has been really bad, especially this episode. Â I think it's a 50/50 problem. 50% her acting b/c there are actors who can do so much and say nothing (Lena Headey, G. Christie) and the other 50% is the writing. Â They have barely even given Jorah more than 2 lines an episode and Iain Glen is one of the better actors they have on this show. He's being seriously underused so far this season and we are halfway through it. Â

I hope that when things start going bad for her in Meeren she'll act again as the young clueless woman she is supposed to be.

Â 


I think you just nailed it. Imo that is there intent, they make her distant and regal, hard to relate to and then they bring it all crashing down and make her fully human again.
Â 
Emilia Clarke is more than up to that task I'd say.

3871	boojam	2014-05-05	All in all a decent episode apart from the Mereen scene.Â Â I get Emilia puts on that regal voice when being a harsh queen which we've been seeing for a while but when she's talking to her trusted advisor and good friend Jorah...can't she show a bit of emotion? A bit of humanity? She has no range and I'd really like to see some. I'm getting quite sick of shouting emotionless Daenerys.Â Â How does everyone else feel about this?I thought she did fine up until 'rule' line.At times she seems to need a Actor's Director.I think she does fine with good dialog.Knocks it out the park when speaking Valyrian.

3872	BeornJ	2014-05-05	Watching that scene I thought she was going for 'would-be-queen who is out of her league' but it came off more as her weakly acting as a powerful queen.
3873	RhaenysBalerion	2014-05-05	I don't have any problem with her acting. She is the perfect Daenerys, whatever people say.Â 
Â 
In intense moments she always does a great job, in my opinion, and in average moments like now, she doesn't make an expression because there's no expression to make. What should she look like when she says she'll stay and rule. I don't think that was ever meant to be a dramatic scene. Neither in the books, nor in the show.Â
3874	Cyvasse Khal	2014-05-05	I think the reason she was so impressive in season 1 is no-one had really heard of Emilia Clarke before, and right away she is getting thrust into an uncomfortable nude scene with Viserys, she does really well with the confronting sex/rape scenes with Drogo, she had to essentially learn a made up language and then act while speaking it throughout the whole season, and we definitely see the transformation from vulnerable child to the reborn Mother of Dragons by seasons end. It was a deserved Emmy recognition.
Â 
Problem is: in 1 season we have massive character transformation, the following 3 seasons there is virtually none. Picking up little nuggets of wisdom on how to be a good Queen along her travels doesn't qualify as evolving the character, and so it has really felt like Emilia's acting has been pretty stagnant and same as, but it's mostly because her character is.
Â 
Having said that, her delivery of lines has been irritating me of late. Like others have said in this thread, she used to be pretty casual talking to Jorah, felt like a normal conversation. These days, no matter what the setting, who's around, whether it's positive, concerning, threatening, it's all getting delivered in that same attempted confident regal tone.
3875	Mia B.	2014-05-05	She's just been getting shitty material since. Her dialogue feels like it was written for the trailers rather than for the scenes.Â 


Â 
That is exactly it!! And her lines seem so choppy there's no flow to itÂ 
Â 
In Emilia's defense, I don't think she's doing a bad job, I think she's just trying really hard to make Dany into the strong and ruthless ruler that just isn't similar to book Dany
3876	Night's_King	2014-05-05	The fault is definitly not with the writers. At least, not for the most part.
Â 
Her acting is just stiff. Good actors seem natural in there roles. Emilia clearly doesn't. You look her acting and you really notice the moments she thinks "Oh, I have to smile now, I must not look into the camera!"
Her face when she is "worried" about Daario in the second last episode just looked so forced and bad.
Â 
Can anyone tell me why you think she is a good actress?
3877	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	How can people simply say "it's the directors"? Shouldn't it be the job of the actors to get the most out of their lines and the ensuing scenes? Aiden Gillen was solid on the Wire but keep in mind he was also basically playing a good guy who could not longer handle the pressure. Here's he's portraying a diabolical mastermind from the start.
3878	Thelastactionhero	2014-05-05	I actually rather liked Clarke's performance in this episode. That whole "I will rule" line was cringe worthy bad though.

You would never think Charles Dance can't act, no matter what kind of direction he got. Â But, actors who aren't very talented are more dependent on good direction, with poor direction their flaws are much more noticeable.

Seriously, this. Stephane Dillane's script sucks half to time and he still kills any scene he's in. I don't think Clarke is quite as bad as everyone thinks though. Not great, but not irredeemably awful.

It's basically everyone's fault - but Tywin can say really cool lines and not sound like he's reading a script at a school play.
Â 
From this episode I was hoping for a frank discussion between Jorah and Dany. Ian had some great conflicted acting before everyone else left the room but it's all overwhelmed by Emilia's "cool trailer lines". She should've been more sincere and emotional, and tender seeking advice from her closest friend.Â 
Â 
Daario wasn't there and neither was Grey Worm - she didn't have to go all bitch dragon queen on Jorah. Probably Emilia and the writers/directors are at fault.

3884	AnotherCrannogman	2014-05-05	Actually I take the bad writing comment back as the Pod and Brienne, Lysa and Sansa , cersei   and Tywin scenes were all well written and we'll acted.
3885	Sun	2014-05-05	You can;t blame the director, because she's been sucking through 3 seasons with all the different directors. You can't blame the script, because her delivery is the same no matter what words she's speaking, and what the emotional resonance of the scene. Even when she saw a crucified child, her face held the same expression it does when she's looking at her CGI dragons.
Â 
An actor gives resonance to the lines, even bad lines, with delivery, with tone, with facial nuance, with feeling behind the eyes... Emilia gives nothing. Â Â

Â 
I really don't think Emilia's as bad as everyone says. I think the writer's just have this tendency to change moments that should be solemn, and try to make them sound triumphant and regal in the end (like with the Mysha scene).
Â 
Her explanation that she can't rule seven kingdoms if she can't rule slaver's bay was handled well. It was just that last line. Unfortunately it was the last line she speaks, so it's what sticks with people.

I take back part of what I said about Emilia's acting being mostly the director's fault. Some of you have made good arguments, that other actors on the show still manage to pull off impressive performances, even though they're given shitty dialogues. Stephen Dillane is a prime example of this, he's fantastic as Stannis with or without good lines.
Â 
And I find that Lena Headey gives us a very subtle performance of the Show version of Cersei. You might not like what they have done with her character, but her acting is good.Â 
Â 
I don't think Emilia is as bad an actress as her line delivery suggests. Instead I'd classify her as an average actress who can't really lift the material to a new level. Combine that with the trailer-dialogues Â she's given and you have a bad performance.

3903	PhoenixFlame	2014-05-05	Not a bad actress; Nina Gold is a very good casting director.
Â 
But, Emilia's young when it comes to acting. Some directors are great at getting actors to perform their best but others it's just not their forte. MacLaren's strength, in my opinion, is her attention to detail and framing. Gorrrrgeous shots. I think Emilia has plenty of potential but could benefit from a more attentive director. I'm not saying this is the director's fault either. She's not bad but some of her lines some off really stiff and stagey. A veteran actor can take that idea and give it a ton of nuance, like how Headey takes Cersei's ice queen persona and shows you all the cracks. Emilia's performance doesn't quite have that depth.Â 
Â 
Regarding Kristen Stewart, I'm not a big fan of her as an actress but in real life she's very shy and it can make her come off as cold. She's not mean though.Â

So are Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner, and they nail every scene they're in.
Maisie Williams was, what, 14 years old and had been acting for barely a year when she held her own (and then some) opposite Charles Dance.Â 
Emilia Clarke is a bad actress who isn't helped neither her lines nor the directors.Â 
Directors are supposed to bring out the best in their actors: I'm sure with actors like Dance or Headey, there's minimal director involvement cause they're such pros and probably don't need much direction, but when the initial performance is dodgy, a good director will intervene and try to make something out of it.Â 
So with good lines and a talented actor director, I'm sure she could be passable, but as it stands, she is bad to the point of irritating.Â 
After 4 seasons of being bad (she was barely acceptable in S1) under I don't know how many directors though, I think it's safe to say that her monotonous and try-hard delivery is the problem.Â 
I'm sure she is very nice person, but lets call a spade a spade, she's just not good at acting.

3905	Seneti	2014-05-05	She turns an already rather grating book character into someone I just want to repeatedly punch in the face on the show. So many faux bad-ass one liners. So little range. Drives me crazy how many show watchers are in love with her.


Â 
This.
Â 


Meh, Daenerys scenes in season 3 and 4 have been just painful to watch. I didn't like her before, but now I just openly hate her character. Whenever she's speaking to someone without an army at her back or dragons by her side, I find her regal tone absolutely ludicrous. All I see is an angsty teenage girl thinking she's the queen of the world. Not sure if that's the actress' fault though. She's shown that she's capable of emotionally diverse scenes in Season 1, maybe it's just the director instructing her to speak that way, I don't know. All I know is that her scenes annoy the hell out of me whenever one comes up.Â 


Â 
Agreed. Season 1 had so many moments where Emilia just nailed it... making it all the more shocking to watch the decline in quality that followed.
Â 


You can;t blame the director, because she's been sucking through 3 seasons with all the different directors. You can't blame the script, because her delivery is the same no matter what words she's speaking, and what the emotional resonance of the scene. Even when she saw a crucified child, her face held the same expression it does when she's looking at her CGI dragons.
Â 
An actor gives resonance to the lines, even bad lines, with delivery, with tone, with facial nuance, with feeling behind the eyes... Emilia gives nothing. Â Â 


Â 
Actually, I blame all of them a little bit. I blame the writers for giving her too many cheesy one liners. I blame the directors for not encouraging her to emote more. But most of all I blame Emilia for playing this character with a permanent "deer in the headlights" look that strips any scene of all emotion.
3906	Cas Stark	2014-05-05	Â All of her scenes now give me a sense of her thinking "If I look back I am lost"...they are totally one note.
3907	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-05-05	I'm still torn as to how much is bad acting/lack of range compared to bad writing/editing/directing.
Â 
A great performance still needs to be 'worked' into a great final product, and part of the directors' job is knowing when they've captured the best 'raw' shot to achieve that end. Â Having said that, it seems that everyone else in Emilia's scenes is making it work while she consistently comes up well short, so...
Â 
I thought the conversation between Peter and Jack in 4.02 was incredibly wooden and awkward (reminiscent of basically all of Emilia's scenes) and I consider the two of them to be extremely talented actors. Â Is it possible the producers are trying for "wooden and awkward" with her?

Â 
This is stated perfectly, I almost get embarrassed for her watching some of her scenes.
3909	sj4iy	2014-05-05	I think she was trying to sound confident, but it didn't quite come out right because the look on her face didn't match the words that she said.Oh, well- all of the actors have some good days and bad days. I just hope that they find a way to make her storyline interesting.

3910	direwoofwoof	2014-05-05	She was great in season 1- the fear of her brother, marrying the Khal, falling in love with him, becoming Khaleesi, and then becoming the mother of dragons. Since then, her scenes seem to be more about the scenery than her. Now that she is in the "I'm just gonna stay here and lead for a few years" it's almost like she has pushed the pause button on that role.
3911	Natalie Underfoot	2014-05-05	I feel like her acting has just dropped so much and so I believe it's the quality of the writing. Â If she was given more to work with other than righteous indignation and declarative sentences it would be great. Â We get it, she found her spine that's great, but she's still a kid in a world she knows nothing about who has had a lot of people kiss her ass for awhile but some uncertainty would be good. Â I actually like her better when she's either a) not talking or  interacting with Daario as that's the only place that seems natural. He's not a yes-man, a bad guy, or a worshipper which is basically the only people she's been surrounded by since Drogo died. Â Just goes to show that the depth of the characters in her part of the world has been neglected to make her look ascendant.Â
3912	marsyao	2014-05-05	Â 
I don't think Emilia is as bad an actress as her line delivery suggests. Instead I'd classify her as an average actress who can't really lift the material to a new level. Combine that with the trailer-dialogues Â she's given and you have a bad performance.


Â 
To be fair to her, Danny is a very annoying character to begin with in the novel, soÂ it is very hard to make her likable in the TV
3913	C0bR	2014-05-05	Turn her back to Jorah.
Look off into the distance.
Make sure not to make eye contact with camera.
Deliver line.
Pause for suspense.
Turn around and look at Jorah.
Calmly deliver line with inflections on certain syllables.
Â 
Nailed it.


David Caruso school of acting
3914	Colonel Green	2014-05-05	Clarke isn't the best actress on the show by any means, but the writers seem to have largely reduced Dany to the imposing queen figure; various moments where I thought a bit more emotion and/or doubt could have been put into the writing (like with the slave children or the crucifixion order reprisal, or in this episode) she was still just written in conqueror mode.
Â 
Also, some of the dialogue she's been given lately isn't great, like the bizarre exchange with Daario about why he took control of the Meereenese navy.Â  Because it would be useful to your cause, maybe?
3915	gash	2014-05-05	she's a terrible actress. she was just about passable as a naive young girl but acting like a queen is way above her pay grade.

Â 
I wasn't bothered by the lack of emotion at the children, I thought Stoic Emilia was appropriate there.
Â 
But she now speaks in the same regal tone of voice with the same bearing whether she's standing before thousands of troops or talking to 3 people in a small room. Â That is bad acting that was enabled by feeble direction.
3918	A Man Is A Man	2014-05-05	Â She's pretty bad. Everything she does comes across as artificial. Even when she smiles, I don't ever believe she's smiling, it's like she's thinking: "okay, now just stretch the sides of my mouth up to form a smile, I'm saying something nice to one of my advisors...."
3919	Autumn is Coming	2014-05-05	I've thought this for a while, but I usually just tend to let it go. Emilia's a stage actress, so she's used to having to project her voice rather than focus on her facial expressions.
(That said, she sometimes seems to have problems emoting with her voice, as well  )
3920	El Guapo	2014-05-05	The delivery on the "I will do what queens do ..." line was very cheesy, but the rest of the scene wasn't bad.
Â 
Her interaction with Daario, for instance ... the very subtle irritation she displayed was spot on.
Â 
I really don't think Emilia's as bad as everyone says. I think the writer's just have this tendency to change moments that should be solemn, and try to make them sound triumphant and regal in the end (like with the Mysha scene).
Â 
Her explanation that she can't rule seven kingdoms if she can't rule slaver's bay was handled well. It was just that last line. Unfortunately it was the last line she speaks, so it's what sticks with people.


Â 
I agree with pretty much all of this.
3921	PatrickStormborn	2014-05-05	I thought both Emilia and Iain Glen were very disappointing in their scene together... They honestly both looked stoned.Â  
Â 
The scene was far too rushed, the dialogue was weak and completely lacked the severity that the book scene had, the directing was poor, and it seems like the showrunners don't know what they're doing with the characterisation of anyone in Dany's retinue.
Â 
Most of these problems would be resolved if they stuck closer to the book dialogue and spent more time on Dany's scenes instead of wasting it on pointless filler. Dany has felt like an after-thought in every episode this season with the exception of episode three. Considering she's THE iconic character of the show, it's a very strange decision (particularly in an episode without Tyrion, the other iconic character).
3922	Pib_Juju	2014-05-05	I think she's a capable actress, and proved as much through seasons 1-3. Her character changes a lot over that period and she portrayed it well (along with the writers and directors).
Â 
I think the problem with her scenes this season is a lot deeper than a performance. It's the show writers and directors doing not-so-hot work with not-so-hot source material. Dany's story is a snooze fest, imho, from Astapor onward.
3923	Nami	2014-05-05	Emilia was at her best in season 1
Though I think part of the problem is the directing, because almost everyone is not as good as they were in season 1.
3924	Nami	2014-05-05	Â 
Â 
Seriously! Emilia is beautiful. Granted she does look better as a brunette.
Â

That's because that wig and dark eyebrows are ridiculous. How hard is it to dye her eyebrows lighter? Jfc it was lighter in the first season
3925	sj4iy	2014-05-05	Emilia was at her best in season 1Though I think part of the problem is the directing, because almost everyone is not as good as they were in season 1.She was at her best in Season 1 because she actually had something to do other than ride around on a horse shouting orders. I would say it's the fault of the story more than the fault of the actress or director.
3926	Wayfarer	2014-05-05	The problem is some people want to see more emotion from her but she doesn't write the script.Â  When she was alone with Ser Jorah the script writers should of had a more personal Daenerys come out instead they stuck with the cold stoic ruler figure they want her to be.
This is the problem, I find the direction is confused when it comes to Daenerys, shes blonde, slender a gracile figure and soft on the outside and they want to keep that side of her while at the same time they want this natural ruler of Tagaryn stock in the Dothraki style.Â  In the first series where she didn't have the ruler persona she done well portraying this innocent girl caught up in a bad world, when she addresses her men she can be the strong leader, but when the directors want her to be both at the same time poor Emilia doesn't know what to do and the directors aren't much help either.Â 
My advice to the show producers, flesh her character out, let her be the gentle girl in a brutal world when shes being herself and let her be the strong ruler when she needs to be, don't try to make her both.
Also to some of the haters on here, wow your blaming her for things entirely out of her control, hate the character by all means but the actress behind it can only do what she given with and perhaps you need to look inside yourselves to see where the hate is really coming from.Â  Emilia Clarke has shown she can play the character brilliantly so it is not her acting abilities that are to blame here.
3927	Tori Targaryen	2014-05-05	I think people are confusing Daenerys' acting for Emilia's.... Dany IS acting, she's playing a role, it's obvious that she is. Where Emilia works is in the eyes. I can call out several GOT actors I'd consider below par, but Emilia isn't one of them.
3928	Mother of Flagons	2014-05-05	I think people are confusing Daenerys' acting for Emilia's.... Dany IS acting, she's playing a role, it's obvious that she is. Where Emilia works is in the eyes. I can call out several GOT actors I'd consider below par, but Emilia isn't one of them.


Which actors? Just curious!
3929	Fat Trell	2014-05-05	I would like to see Emilia explain her portrayal of Dany. I was surprised to find out she was one of the only actors on the show to have read the books, and that she consults them regularly. I wonder if she is trying toÂ show Dany'sÂ queenly mask(her bunny ears as well), and trying to keep her internal doubts just that.Â Â
3930	bobbybuilderton	2014-05-05	I think people are confusing Daenerys' acting for Emilia's.... Dany IS acting, she's playing a role, it's obvious that she is. Where Emilia works is in the eyes. I can call out several GOT actors I'd consider below par, but Emilia isn't one of them.


It thoroughly irritates me when someone tries to tell me why I think a certain way.Â 
It is possible to portray that your character is putting on a show without it being obvious that you yourself are putting on a show. Do you know what that requires? A talented actress, which Emilia Clarke is not. For example, Tywin talking to Tommen after Joffrey died. It's obvious that Tywin is trying to mold him. It is not obvious that Charles Dance is acting as Tywin trying to mold him. You claim Daenerys is playing a role, fine. But it's also extremely obvious that Emilia is playing Daenerys.
Â 
The issue for me, if I had to summarize it, is that when I watch her act, it's very obvious that I'm watching Â someone act. I never had much of a problem with Kit because even though he was a one note portrayal, I still could buy that he was that character. Mopey kid who went to the wall to be grumpy. With Emilia I find it more and more obvious that this is a person reading lines. I have the same issue with Shae.
Â 
My description of the problem also explains why she's generally better when speaking made up languages. Mannerisms and inflection can change quite a bit in other cultures, so we naturally don't think much of it. You know this if you have a friend who doesn't have much of an accent, but then they speak another language when talking to a relative and you're like ":O was that really her?"
Â 
Now if this is the fault of Emilia, the writing, the directing, or a combination of all three, I don't know for sure. Â Leaning towards mostly writing and Emilia though. "All men must die but we aren't men am I right?! Burn ALL the bras! Look at me I am a strong female character who only knows how to portray confidence by exaggerating everything I do!"
Â 
For the show in general, the writers are trying too much to write things that sound cool. This was not the case in the first season. Watching a conversation in this show now is like hearing two people compete for who can get the most trailer time. If they would write dialogue that actual people would say, it would increase in quality dramatically. This isn't an issue limited to Daenerys's story, but it shows up most often there. It's very apparent you're watching people act. Little things like "kill the masters" written in English break your immersion and make you aware of the experience.Â

Â 
I agree that the scene felt rather rushed. That is honestly one of my favorite Dany moments in the whole series. As well as one of the most important decisions she has made in her entire arc. It felt too casual; like Dany was explaining to Jorah how they would be having goat, not horse for lunch.
3933	Nami	2014-05-05	The directors are not doing the directing. I thought it was obvious by now and we even have a scene that was supposed to be something but it came out another thing to the audience.
3934	jabulaniman	2014-05-05	Totally. I'm not sure if it's Emilia's fault, but I'm so sick of the ridiculous melodrama. "Who told you to take the navy?" "Ill do what a queen does. RULE!"
I just rolled my eyes and shook my head. 
Cant stand the direction Dany and Cersei have gone in the show. The rest if the ep was awesome though, as usual.
3935	Cas Stark	2014-05-05	Yeah, who told you to take the navy...oh, right, I might need it, nevermind was really, really bad on all levels, writing and delivery.

I think that's the part that bothered me the most. She acted kind of blasA© about it, when in the books it's a big deal. She needed to be more contrite especially when she was talking with Jorah alone. The last line really bothered me in the deliver (the it will rule), this was the right decision but it should have been a hard decision.  
I don't know if I already posted this from D&Dnnnit clearly shows they get it, but somehow it's not translating on screen:
D. B. Weiss: This scene shows Dany learning a lesson that I think all revolutionaries learned at one point or another, which is that conquering in many ways is a whole lot easier than ruling.
David Beniof: This is a pivotal moment for Daenerys because for so long, her sole goal was getting back to Westeros, conquering Westeros, sitting on the Iron Throne, and becoming the queen that she believes she has every right to be. And now she has the opportunity.
D. B. Weiss: Sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s driven by a kind of a deep empathy â<U+0080><U+0094> a much deeper empathy than probably anybody else on the show. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s something that makes her as charismatic as she is to people because they can sense the sincerity of it. Her empathy allows her to look at the people of Westeros and say â<U+0080>Why the hell would they ever follow me if I havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t proven myself through my actions to be somebody worth following? Why would they let me rule if I hadnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t proven myself to be someone who has ruled well somewhere else?â<U+0080><U+0099>
3937	lostinwesteros	2014-05-05	I actually had a hard time with Dany's POVs from the beginning.  I thought her chapters were too long and pretty boring when compared to the others. I do know that some of that results from my strong preference for Westeros and the action there, but nonetheless I just found her storyline a bit disjointed. By the time I got to Book 5, it was really, really hard for me to get through her chapters.  
That said, I'm not sure I can be terribly objective about the actor's portrayal of her, even though I know they're two separate things. I will say that I have liked Emilia's portrayal of her somewhat better than I liked the character in the books, but by the time I got to the Mysa episode last season, I was ready to throw up.  Things haven't improved for me this season.  It's like listening to the same note being played over and over.  I think 4.05 was the second worst so far.
3938	Ella Dendron	2014-05-05	She was tolerable in season 1, especially when Harry Lloyd was around (he totally stole her spotlight - I was always more focused on Viserys than on Daenerys when they were both on screen). Once his character died there was nothing but dead eyes from Emilia. She is always staring into an empty space with no expression whatsoever. Once she became "queen" she added her "commanding voice" to the mix and the result is almost unbearable. There is no story behind her facade, she is like an empty human being with no emotional depth. It's almost like Drogo and all the other shit didn't happen at all or happened to someone else. Sophie Turner is not the best actress on the show (far from it) but you can actually see all the emotional suffering she went through on her face even when she is talking about lemon cakes. It would be nice to see that Daenerys is actually a person with real feelings one of these days.

Â 
I think Sophie Turner does a very good job, actually. Â She can show emotion just through her eyes and her bearing, that to me is a sign of a real actress. Â Emilia Clark, all she can show with her eyes is "steely determination/stoicism" and she's lost whatever ability she had to convey any emotion through inflection or anything else. Â She's like a robot.
3940	Ramsay Gimp	2014-05-05	"I will ruuuuuule" and then the back turn made me want to hurl. I'm this close to just fast forwarding through her scenes this season

That's what I said. I am not criticizing Sophie I am actually praising her. I just said that there are better actresses on the show than her (Lena, Michelle, Gwendoline).
3942	ipsuel	2014-05-05	I honestly don't like Dany's storyline past GoT (it's getting better for me in ADwD, though)... but...that being said, I think Emilia Clarke has taken way too much heat for her portrayal of Dany.Â 
Â 
I think people really need to lay some blame at the writers/directors here. For example, when she tried to pull off her regal voice this episode (and failed miserably) -- why didn't the directors say, "Hey, I see what you're trying, but remember, Dany's a young girl and still learning -- Â don't try to sound like Queen Elizabeth. It's inauthentic."
Â 
Did they not hear what we all heard? Of course they did -- why didn't they make her re-shoot it? Because they clearly LIKED it.Â 
Â 
So... who, ultimately, is to blame? The young actress trying, or the people who are putting out sub-par performances w/o having them fixed?
3943	PhoenixFlame	2014-05-05	So are Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner, and they nail every scene they're in.
Maisie Williams was, what, 14 years old and had been acting for barely a year when she held her own (and then some) opposite Charles Dance.Â 
Â 


Â 
Maisie and Sophie are more naturally gifted. They were brilliant finds.Â 
Â 
Certainly, Dany's putting on the face expected of her, but a better actress could convey more of what was going on underneath, or show the effects of having to wear a mask so much. Take, for example, Kevin McKidd in Rome. His character is a legionnaire who's outwardly cold and traditional, but there are small moments throughout S1 where he shows more passion and tightly-bound emotions. Therefore, when he apocalyptically loses his shit in the season finale, it feels awesomely believable.

They could do as much reshooting as they want but if she can't deliver the lines then they've got to take what they've got.
Â 
Ian Glenn just completely out-acted Emilia in this scene with his single look of "No we don't have enough to take Westeros but I'm going to have to say maybe to please you". That one look had more feeling and emotion in it that all of Emilia's acting this season.

Â 
I disagree - when you're putting out a poor product, you find a way around it -- change the lines, if you must. Pan the camera elsewhere. Whatever. (Obviously, I'm not a director lol).
Â 
Regardless, when the same complaints are voiced (loudly) over and over (and over!) again -- and you keep putting it out there, you are to blame. This isn't one movie, it's 10 episodes a year... meaning they have 10 eps a year to improve/alter/work around in order to find the best way to have Emilia portray Dany.Â 
Â 
Her regal voice being a prime example of when a director should MAKE SURE she tones it down. Clearly, they liked it so they kept it.Â 
Â 
Ultimately, D&D are responsible for what we see.Â 
Â 
ETA: Agree 100% about Ian Glenn.Â

I agree. Â I do think that better direction for her is needed, because she is capable of doing better, she's really regressed this season, and last night was off the charts, almost into Conan the Barbarian bad camp. Â She can be believable, because she has been bettter in the past.
Â 
However, you are correct that D&D are putting it out there so they must approve of it.

Â 
:-) Â Funny thing is, I'm not even a fan of her storyline, so I don't care too much -- it works ok for me.
Â 
But, like you just said, she can do better, we've seen it. I mean, even the greatest actors/actresses of our time say how important it is to have great direction -- getting guidance towards what they're (the showrunners) looking for is everything. And that's not on her, it's on them.Â
3948	Nictarion	2014-05-05	Â 
Sometimes it is the direction...but I think you only notice it with actors who aren't that good. Â 
Â 
You would never think Charles Dance can't act, no matter what kind of direction he got. Â But, actors who aren't very talented are more dependent on good direction, with poor direction their flaws are much more noticeable.Not really a fair comparison, Dance has been acting longer than Emilia Clarke has been alive.

3950	Dreams Of Spring	2014-05-05	I think Emilia is doing very well and I feel like her character has "grown" since season one. However, I do feel like some scenes this season with her have been sort-of rushed though and that could be why she seems un-emotional.
3951	darksellsword	2014-05-05	I must have watched an entirely different episode because I thought it was one of her best performances. Yes she does use this regal tone at times but in this episode she was smiling at Jorah and very warm demeanour and the line Â "it appears my liberation of slavers bay hasn't gone quiet as planned" I took as being self deprecating. I understand how people feel about her character but we don't have Daenerys inner thoughts like we had in the books to show us her self doubt and good intentions it fleshes out her more pompous comments. Emilia Clarke is great at portraying Dany on the show in my view.

Â She and the woman who plays Shae are hands down the weakest acting links/IMHO the only bad actor on the show is the actress that plays Shae. Nina Gold did a brilliant job casting this show. And when proven actors aren't as good as they usually are (Aidan Gillen,  Ciaran Hinds for example) I wonder if the problem is more the writing and direction.
3956	MoIaF	2014-05-05	I couldn't disagree more. I don't get all the fuss over Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams otoh is brilliant.


Â 
Agree. Sophie has done better with each season but Maisie is absolutely amazing. I don't think you can compare the two.Â 
Â 
It's difficult to see these criticism of Emilia being a bad actress the entirety of the series when you have scenes like Dracarys, which must be one of the best in the entire series. She was excellent in season 1 (along with mostly everyone else) because the writing and directing was much better.Â
3957	Cas Stark	2014-05-05	IMHO the only bad actor on the show is the actress that plays Shae. Nina Gold did a brilliant job casting this show.

Â 
Kit Harrington is kind of dodgy as well, but he's improved this year, where to me Emilia has gotten totally stiff and regressed to her season 2 form.
Â 
I have no answer for WTF goes with Gillen, though the batman voice seems to have been toned down the last two episodes.
Â 
Hinds wasn't 'bad' he just wasn't Mance...and that is definitely direction.
3958	sastelise	2014-05-05	Emilia's performance in past scenes/seasons made me appreciate Dany more than I had appreciated her in the books. I think the highlight was last season's Dracarys scene, though it could have also been the brilliant music accompanying that scene. I do agree that she's becoming a bit of a one trick pony, but that could also be due to the writing and Dany's situation in general. I only began liking Dany at the end of book five when she's all alone in the middle of nowhere . Book 5 made her seem more human, and her trek (back to civilization I presume) showed that she has endurance and courage. I'm willing to give the actress a chance and look forward to seeing what she can do when given better material.
3959	Mordos_Kull	2014-05-05	I found it amusing how Emilia turned away from Jorah rather stiffly, said one sentence of dialogue, turned back round stiffly, said another line, and then turned stiffly back for the closing moment.
Â 
As an actor, i found her choice of movement very theatrical.

Â That was the fault of the writing though, S2 was not kind to Dany's storyline. I mean stealing her dragons ffs, c'mon. But we will just have to agree to disagree on Emilia, I think she's fine, not great, but no where near as bad as some suggest.
3961	The BlackBear	2014-05-05	Eh, Aiden plays a good Petyr. Not sure why people complain about him.


Aiden's Petyr, be it acting decision, writing or direction, is far to blatantly evil. Littlefinger works in the books because he seems trustworthy, people trust him to do things, like run the finances, broker the Tyrell match etc. They underestimate him, and he rarely reveals his hand. But from S2 onwards it seems to me and increasingly moreso, Littlefinger might as well be wearing a flashing neon sign, declaring him to be a self-centred asshole.
Â 


Oh, and show tits every once in awhile.Â 


Whilst not defending her acting at all, I take issue with this statement. Emilia Clark is one of the few actresses to stand up to D&D about the ridiculous and gratuitous use of female nudity on this show. She's refused to appear in breast baring scenes. I can't remember when this decision came into force, but it was clearly after season 1.
3962	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-05-05	I think people are confusing Daenerys' acting for Emilia's.... Dany IS acting, she's playing a role, it's obvious that she is. Where Emilia works is in the eyes. I can call out several GOT actors I'd consider below par, but Emilia isn't one of them.


Â 
So basically, Dany is a low-functioning sociopath and Emilia Clarke is a brilliant actress?
Â 
If Emilia is playing a bad actress then she's doing a hell of a job, because every scene she's in in absolutely horrible. Â I would need some sort of justification before accepting the idea that Dany never let's her guard down and is always "playing" whatever emotions she is "exhibiting". Â It's one thing when she's trying to appear strong for her people or to an enemy, but it makes little sense for her to do it behind closed doors.
3963	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-05	i just posted a bit about this on another thread...i was disappointed with Emilia's performance this ep...seemed like her heart wasnt in it...only one moment when she looks at Jorah before he admits it could be possible to take kings landing was good...rest? all her lines delivery seemed weak...i mean such a huuuuge decision to give up on Westeros and focus on slavers bay...bah!Â
3964	Tyrion Lannister	2014-05-05	Whilst not defending her acting at all, I take issue with this statement.

I can't remember when this decision came into force, but it was clearly after season 1.


She was topless last season, so unless this is something that happened within the last year, I'm not sure where you're getting that from. Â And her being willing to do those kinds of scenes when the script calls for it certainly isn't something she should be criticized for anyway.
3965	Zman1863	2014-05-05	She definitely came across as unnaturally wooden in this episode, especially given that this scene was a closed door meeting with her advisers and then Jorah alone. It was like watching a female George Washington or Darth Vader. It's partially Clarke's performance, but a lot can be blamed on the writing and direction.Â 
Â 
I think the show has never fully captured the sort of youthful vulnerability that Dany has in the books. They have shown vulnerability, but it manifests in ways that are out of character for the book counterpart- the WHERE ARE MY DROGONZ subplot is the prime example. In the books Dany is a privately insecure person who makes things up as she goes. In the show she looks a lot more confident in her own identity and this takes away from the internal struggle that dominates her ADWD arc particularly.Â
3966	Hodor's Dragon	2014-05-05	You know, I agree that Clarke was a bit over-the-top in the "I will rule" scene, but over-the-top and stiff are two different things. Â Stiff I didn't see. She was channeling Cate Blanchett - "I am my father's daughter" - but didn't quite get it, I don't think.
Â 
Generally, though, I think she's a very talented actress who is still growing in her craft and does some things better than others. Â She was hired because she was able to play the scared young girl the show began with and also transition into the conquering dragon queen. Â As D.B. Weiss put it:
Â 
Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a role that demands a huge range of emotion. She starts out as a helpless little girl and she ends the first season in a very strong place. For the scared part, there were a number of people who could do the beginning stuff very well, but finding somebody who could switch into the gravitas that was necessary for the end of the season â<U+0080>¦â<U+0080><U+009D>
Â 
IMO she was on the money as "helpless little girl," and as for "dragon queen," any discussion of her acting abilities has to take into account the way she bloody nailedÂ easily the best sceneÂ in the show's 4 years. Â That scene was well done for any actress to handle, but she frickin' destroyed it.
Â 
"Helpless little girl" and "dragon queen" are her strengths, and sometimes she struggles in between. Â But she has stage presence, intelligence, and an expressive face. Â She's an excellent choice for the role, and is struggling slightly as her plot drags through the mid-story lull. Â I have a feeling she will have more excellent material at the end.
Â 
But anybody who can take your best material and make it sing is a force to be reckoned with. Â If you don't like Emilia Clarke as Daenerys, then you're just gonna have to deal with it.

3968	Travy1991	2014-05-05	I've generally really enjoyed Emilia's portrayal of Dany but I agree that she came across unnaturally wooden in this week's episode. But in every other episode, I don't see what a large majority of the audience is seeing. Ranking her within the cast, she would be fairly low but I do put that down to youth. Kit Harrington and Richard Madden have had similar times when they've come across rather wooden. Kit gets enough flak on this site but in the Red Wedding scene, Madden had very little expression on his face when he was looking at Talisa's body. Michelle Fairley acted circles around him in that scene. Hell, the 5 seconds of shock on Oona Chaplin's face when she was stabbed in the belly outacted Madden. But ultimately, I find it forgivable. Not everyone is expressive and radiating gravitas all the time. Some peoples' faces may say one thing and their inner-conscious another. Madden, Harrington and Clarke, in my opinion, are solid for the most part and have each pulled off some really strong performances from time to time while they've had underwhelming moments too. They don't have the gravitas and experience of Sean Bean, Mark Addy, Michelle Fairley and Charles Dance. Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams are two naturally very gifted actors whereas Madden, Harrington and Clarke have to work at it a little more. Isaac Hempstead-Wright is similar to these guys, he's never been spectacular, but I can't recall any outwardly bad deliveries either.
Â 
Sibel Kekilli is probably the poorest actress on the show but I feel the need to defend her too. I've seen some of her German films and she's very good in them. I think she lacks fluency in English and so some of her line readings are a poor because of this. It doesn't help that the writers have made Shae so unlikeable and petulant - essentially a caricature of a jealous girlfriend. If you go back in Season 1, Kekilli radiates a sort of sexy mysteriousness even though a more understated petulance is there too. And I believe it was Kekilli who said "no" to further nude scenes as Emilia got naked at the end of Season 3.
Â 
Kit and Emilia are probably the two biggest book fans in the cast so it's interesting that they underwhelm so many fans. Watching interviews with Emilia, she always comes across so smiley and dorky. It's a pity they won't allow Emilia's natural personality to sink into Dany's character a little more.
3969	Batman	2014-05-05	I think Emilia should always speak in either Dothraki or High Valyrian, for some reason she's a lot better when using fake languages than english XD


Â 
The Mel Gibson technique?
3970	cade	2014-05-05	I think Emilia Clarke has been outstanding, showing exceptional range in how much her character has changed, but unlike so many others I don't present myself as an acting expert here to deliver objective truth. I recognize it's a highly subjective matter. Even her work in 3x04, one of the most acclaimed performances of the entire series, has been criticized by some and I never say they're wrong. As with so many things discussed on this forum, it comes down to personal preference, not a black and white contest over right and wrong.
Â 
What is provably wrong, though, is to say Emilia Clake's "delivery is the same no matter what words she's speaking." Even in the very scene that's been so heavily criticized here, she very clearly changed her delivery when saying, "How can I rule the Seven Kingdoms if I can't control Slavers' Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?"
Â 
You can say she didn't pull it off, but her facial expression and tone of voice are objectively different in that moment, and it's being completely ignored. I think she expressed Dany's doubt and fear of inadequacy very well, and I like how she transitioned from that to her realization that she needs to be better, though as usual I wish the writers had given her more to work with. It often feels to me like they're trying to rush through her scenes so they can get back to the politicking in King's Landing.
Â 
Here is director Michelle MacLaren on the scene:
Â 
We got a brief but very powerful scene with Dany. What was the key to getting that right?
"It was really important to see that moment where she realizes that she needs to become a queen in the true sense of ruling her people. She needs to rule by example. Right before she says "I going to do what queens do. I'm going to rule," there's a calm confidence that comes over her. In that moment, I really think she steps up to a whole new level of being a queen. It was really important to feel that she's a ruler. It's pretty impressive. She's very determined in that moment and very queenly."
Â 
And Alex Graves on episode three:
Â 
The Daenerys stuff was pretty crazy too. It calls back to the scene with the Unsullied you directed last year.
That was when I was done prepping the Purple Wedding. I went home, and instead of sleeping I had to plan that. I always called Meereen my 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. part-time job. If you get into the marrow of that daily storyline it is always, always Emilia (Clarke). She is the most motivating, stimulating young actor of many I've worked with. She is utterly old-school professional. She carries around a ripped up, wrecked, ruined version of the book we're shooting, because she is one of the only people who reads the books. And behind all of that, every time you say action, you watch this performance occur that is Nirvana.What was she like shooting the episode's big Daenerys finale?
You're in a rock quarry with like 500 smelly guys, and the crew is exhausted, and everybody is on edge, and Emilia comes on set and all of a sudden the whole crew is like (in a sing-songy voice): "Emilia! Good morning, Emilia. How are you?" It brings out the best in everybody. It's like Audrey Hepburn has just walked onto the set. And nobody is more gracious than she is on the set. It's just great. She is a good example.

No, he's pretty much that way in the books. Â Only Ned, Cat, and Lysa have trusted him.

What the show has done a bit differently is to make it clear that he'll be happy to rule over a kingdom of ashes (the chaos ladder monologue, which I liked, and "I'd risk everything to get everything." Â But Aiden has (presumably) little to no control about how the character is written.

3981	hollowcrown	2014-05-06	hollowcrown
I would like to get your take on this.
Last sequence Season 3 Episode 4, so called Dracarys scene.
I thought Emilia Ace-ed it.
Your take?


Â 
Dracarys scene was awesome, because she was acting as a powerful, stoic, badass warrior queen.
Â 
However the problem isn't with that, the problem is her acting like that in every single scene even when it doesn't make sense. You don't speak to an army in the same way as you speak to your close friends and that's what lets her down.
3982	BlackTalon	2014-05-06	I wonder if she intentionally seems a bit wooden? I imagine that might very well be how a insecure young girl acts who has been saddled with the responsibilty for thousands of Unsullied and tens of thousnds of freed slaves and who is desperately trying to seem regal and self assured all the time.
3983	Sun	2014-05-06	One thing Emilia can do is give orders in a loud voice. Just because she sounds sexy speaking a fictitious language heavily vested with rolled R sounds does not mean she can act, especially when that's the only thing she seems capable of.
Â 
Â 
ETA:
Â 
At least Harrington is showing some improvement, not much, but some.Â

3984	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-06	Ive been an emilia defender all the way through but she really let me down this episode, we get the cold queen act with cersei and its 100 times better, emilia is fantastic acting in other languages, especially her valyrian but where is the confused young girl!?!? All we are seeing be right now is a cold, haughty regal dany without any of the uncertainty and naivity - we had one nuanced moment when her face dropped upon hearing whats happened to yunkai and astapor - was it really too much to have one vulnerable line following ???
3985	Bayard	2014-05-06	How can people simply say "it's the directors"? Shouldn't it be the job of the actors to get the most out of their lines and the ensuing scenes? Aiden Gillen was solid on the Wire but keep in mind he was also basically playing a good guy who could not longer handle the pressure. Here's he's portraying a diabolical mastermind from the start.


Â 
Go watch Lorna Doone, where he is the villain and completely steals the show. To me directing can be a big problem in the format of the series. They have multiple directors, who really don't know the complete story, so they don't have huge powers on set, so they can't be too rough to the actors if they aren't up to par.
3986	sj4iy	2014-05-06	She tried to act "regal", didn't pull it off.
There, summarized the problem.
3987	Ice_and_Fire	2014-05-06	She was particularly bad in this scene. I cringed so much at the 'I will rule' line. Problem is every time she tries to act 'regal', but this has been a consistent problem that hasn't improved over the series. TV Dany is so wooden and bland, I don't see why the unsullied love her so much, maybe most people just see the cute girl and cool dragons. I am so hoping that the directors will step in and help her, but if it hasn't happened yet I don't think it will :-/
3988	Gogossos	2014-05-06	It is no secret that Dany has few fans on this board and I think a lot of people here are conflating their Dany disappointment with Emilia's. In my view, she's a top actress, just like Sophie and Maisie. But they play different characters, so requirements for Sansa are different from Dany's or Arya's. It's a similar thing with Kit, people are saying he is better this season but it's because the material has changed: Jon is more assertive, he's aware of the threat and is less concerned about the likes of Slynt. So that mopping around? That was Jon, and Kit intentionally played it so - a good sign of an actor nailing his scenes.
Â 


I don't have any problem with her acting. She is the perfect Daenerys, whatever people say.Â 
Â 
In intense moments she always does a great job, in my opinion, and in average moments like now, she doesn't make an expression because there's no expression to make. What should she look like when she says she'll stay and rule. I don't think that was ever meant to be a dramatic scene. Neither in the books, nor in the show.Â 


Â 
Exactly. The only problem I see is that sometimes the tv script simplifies the book scene and at that point it's up to the actress and director to portray the removed layers. It seems that some wanted to see a S1 Dany when she was alone with Jorah but both aren't the same people at this stage. Jorah has gotten more lustful and she's now his queen, the relationship needs to have a slightly uneasiness to it and I think they're nailing it.Â 
Â 


I thought both Emilia and Iain Glen were very disappointing in their scene together... They honestly both looked stoned.Â  
Â 
The scene was far too rushed, the dialogue was weak and completely lacked the severity that the book scene had, the directing was poor, and it seems like the showrunners don't know what they're doing with the characterisation of anyone in Dany's retinue.
Â 
Most of these problems would be resolved if they stuck closer to the book dialogue and spent more time on Dany's scenes instead of wasting it on pointless filler. Dany has felt like an after-thought in every episode this season with the exception of episode three. Considering she's THE iconic character of the show, it's a very strange decision (particularly in an episode without Tyrion, the other iconic character).


Â 
I agree with you almost all the time but I have to disagree that Emilia and Iain were disappointing, or that they looked stoned. In fact, they looked like they've taken their first baths in ages, as they must have. The scene wasn't weak per se but it wasn't as strong at it could've been. I really, really wanted to hear Dany bringing up Eroeh, the Lhazarene girl she rescued from rape only for her to be raped later on. In the book she keeps that thought to herself when she hears of Astapor. It doesn't surprise her that things got worse after she left Astapor but it shakes her nonetheless. More poignantly, she had just discovered Jorah's betrayal (which hasn't happened on the show yet). So it is a mixture of sadness, disappointment and a sense of failure but rather paradoxically not surprised. After the triumphant Daracarys scenes, Dany is outwardly successful but on the inside she feels like a failure but determined to make it right.Â 
Â 
Like you said Patrick, the book scene was more powerful, and its dialogue wouldn't have taken much longer time either. In it she mentions "Aegon the Conqueror brought fire and blood to Westeros, but afterward he gave them peace, prosperity, and justice. But all I have brought to Slaver's Bay is death and ruin" as part of her logic. I totally agree that they're rushing too many of Dany's scenes. She was raging angry when she nailed the masters but haunted by the act afterwards, even though she doesn't regret it "Harsh justice is still justice".Â Most of Dany's scenes lack this complexity: we don't see her having bad dreams, we don't get the sense she trusts no one but I still hope they do justice to the Jorah betrayal.
Â 


I think people are confusing Daenerys' acting for Emilia's.... Dany IS acting, she's playing a role, it's obvious that she is. Where Emilia works is in the eyes. I can call out several GOT actors I'd consider below par, but Emilia isn't one of them.


Â 
I agree, Emilia works with the eyes so well, just like Lena Heady. You can tell when she's flirting with Daario, or that she trusts Jorah or when she's playful when she catches Grey Worm and Missandei flirting. All this without any other bodily differences, except the eyes. She's a good actress.Â

3989	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-06	Im just confused how much of this characterisation is the directors fault now and how much is emilia's and ive always been a massive defender of her. This haughty ice queen stiff as a board bollocks is really, finally starting to annoy the hell out of me.

It would have to be both, right? Â It's clear the show sees her as Targaryen Jesus and I'm coming to the realization that my personal negative view of Ms. Targaryen may not be shared by GRRM and she may end up the savior figure afterall...so, if they're vested in this view of her, they are more likely to be okay with the Regal All The Time personna. Â Otherwise, they would give her different direction.
Â 
A better actress would probably be able to imbue those scenes with more depth without different direction. Â I'm always amazed at how Dance kills Tywin and hasn't read the books, yet he still evokes that arrogance and ruthlessness without making him a one note villian perfectly.

3992	Queen of Whores	2014-05-06	She may as well have just been smoking a joint when holding that council by how passive and out of it she was acting. My goodness, you'd think she was talking about how boring her day at the office was rather than discussing the impacts of her war campaign based off how completely non-emotional she was. I blame the writing for most of it, but Emilia could maybe try to emote a bit more. We've seen good actors make bad lines good in the past.
3993	Travy1991	2014-05-06	LOL at the "Maybe she was high..." comments. Emilia strikes me as the consummate professional. I don't think she (or any of the actors) would show up on set drunk or stoned.
Â 
Â 



Â 
Ohhhhhh, have you????Â  

Â 


Â 
Haha, Sibel has appeared in non-pornographic movies too. They're the ones I'm talking about.
3994	Bearson	2014-05-06	One thing I kept thinking about after reading the books after the first season of GoT aired, was how the show creators, writers, actors, etc. actually conveyed the book's PoV chapters.
Â 
Dany's chapters in the book reveal a teenage girl that blunders through life, not having the slightest bit of understanding for the world around her and although she's learning, she's still rather reluctant to have certain views (like critical ideas about her father) challenged or even considered. I'm probably one of the few who, after cringing at the "Myhsa! Myhsa!" scenes, thought they were needed.... as long as they are there to convey the same sentiments in Dany's PoV chapters in the book. As in, Dany seeing herself as a heroine, a savior, that people look up to her. Hopefully, the show will challenge her naivety, just as the characters around Dany in the book try and educate her when they can.
Â 
I think Clarke, perhaps unwittingly, pulls off Dany as a girl belonging to a caste (the dragonlords) who never fully "belong", connect, or understand the human world around them just fine. The Valyrian dragonriders (and just them, not the Valyrians in general) are like a seperate species, like the WW, the CotF or the giants. It may be bad acting, but I think it fits with the book.

I never had any problems with EC's acting (I think flawed acting performances never burst any quintessential bubbles, they simply derail a specific fictional universe toward a different trajectory). And cringing at the 'mhysa' stuff as well as the triumphalism is definitely necessary, the same way pessimism towards ideology and grand narratives is always required.

Â 
speaking of her nude scenes...im remembering the last one where she was nude with Daario and demanding his allegiance...i rmr that being a very weak moment for Emilia's skills as well...
Â 
same goes for when she was looking at the crucified kids...
Â 
infact, other than her meereen yelling speech (think we can all agree, shes at her best speaking a foreign language) her 2 really notable acting moments this season wereÂ 
1) when she was playing with drogon and he snaps at her (not easy to accomplish considering CGI), felt her expression was sincere
2) when she tell Barristan "i will answer injustice with justice"...perfectly delivered IMO
Â 
cant say if its poor direction, lines or acting...but director would have kept doing re-takes if he wasnt happy...so seems like they were all fine with the way she was portrayed, i.e it was intended to look like that....
Â 
which makes me think that perhaps all of them were high, not just EmiliaÂ  Â
3998	AnotherCrannogman	2014-05-06	I was thinking of the bath scene when she gets out of the bath and has a complex conversation. Was that last season? My memory of her acting in it was good at least.

3999	Ankou	2014-05-06	Aiden's Petyr, be it acting decision, writing or direction, is far to blatantly evil. Littlefinger works in the books because he seems trustworthy, people trust him to do things, like run the finances, broker the Tyrell match etc. They underestimate him, and he rarely reveals his hand. But from S2 onwards it seems to me and increasingly moreso, Littlefinger might as well be wearing a flashing neon sign, declaring him to be a self-centred asshole.
Â 
Whilst not defending her acting at all, I take issue with this statement. Emilia Clark is one of the few actresses to stand up to D&D about the ridiculous and gratuitous use of female nudity on this show. She's refused to appear in breast baring scenes. I can't remember when this decision came into force, but it was clearly after season 1.


What proof do you have of that? I take issue with the statement because it presumes there's something wrong with doing nudity. Why don't you get on Alfie Allen's case for whipping his wiener out in season 1?
4000	boojam	2014-05-06	Â 
Dracarys scene was awesome, because she was acting as a powerful, stoic, badass warrior queen.
Â 
However the problem isn't with that, the problem is her acting like that in every single scene even when it doesn't make sense. You don't speak to an army in the same way as you speak to your close friends and that's what lets her down.


First she is awesome.
Then she does awesome each time.

Â 
TheBlackBear is speculating because at some point last year, mid-way through Season 3, Oona Chaplin said one of the actresses on the show refused to do nudity although she had previously done nudity on the show before. It became a news story and people were assuming it was Emilia because she hadn't been naked since Season 1 at that point. But then she got her kit off in 3x08 so it probably wasn't her.
Â 
It was most likely Sibel Kekilli. I've seen some horrible slut shaming comments about Sibel online. People saying she should go back and do porn because that's all she is good for. And you might not think Kekilli is a great actress but some of these comments were way out of line. I think TheBlackBear was also criticising the fact that female nudity is favoured more on the show overall than male nudity and there's an imbalance there (which TheBlackBear is not wrong about). He's criticising the sexism of it, not the actual nudity itself.
4005	DaveyJoe	2014-05-06	Yeah there's no proof that Emilia is the one who made those comments.Â  I think it's unlikely considering she did nudity later that season.Â  Shae or Ros makes more sense.

Two things, I heard it was EsmA© Bianco and it's why they killed her character.
Â 
Another, female nudity is more prevalent because we count breasts. If we meant genital exposure, I think men are ahead, if we count shirtlessness generally, men are clearly ahead. Â 
Â 
As a last unrelated note, it's really nasty how people do slut shaming ever. I think besmirching the actor's choice to do nudity, however, is on the same wavelength and just as bad.
4007	salmonsnake	2014-05-06	I for one welcome more gratuitous dick footage on the show. Not for reasons of arousal, but for the organ's inherent comedic merit

Â 
The problem with this statement is that women are essentially property- that's how it was. Â Trying to make the show less 'sexist' and more PC would completely undermine the struggle of the women in that world. Â Characters like Daenerys, Arya, Cersei and Ros are trying to break free from all of that and be players in a man's world. Â When people say "it's not fair to the women!", well, that's the point. Â It wasn't fair and wasn't supposed to be fair.

Usually when the actor can't pull it off, the director stop the scene and give tips. Maybe Emilia even tried to tone it down the badass pose but the directors told her to keep doing it.
But like another user said, there are many directors and just very few have read the books and knows what that character is like.

4019	Cas Stark	2014-05-06	Can someone remind me...what season did Emilia get nominated for an Emmy and does anyone know what scenes they sent as part of the process?
4020	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-06	I think you're probably right which is a damn shame because shes shown that she can be awesome in the shouty commanding bits and vulnerable and innocent in season 1 so why is she so one note now.


Â 
I think she's trying to portray Dany in a Stiff Upper Lip sort of way, i.e. Dany is trying to be stoic and Never Show Weakness in front of people.Â  Which is fine for the other characters but unless the audience can see the character letting their mask slip/crack now and then, they'll think it's just the actor.
Â 
A little bit of her lightening up when it's just Dany and Missandei (or just Dany and DAAARIO~!  )Â  and even just one line about not wanting to look week [maybe even at last dropping the If I Look Back I Am Lost on the show] would go a long way.
Â 
Or just let her shout in fake languages more often because she hams it up in a good way when she's doing that.

She did not receive an Emmy nomination in Season 1, only Peter Dinklage received an Emmy nomination that year. Emilia received an Emmy nomination in Season 3 for "Now His Watch Is Ended" (3x04) for the "Dracarys" scene.

Then she turned out to be the equal of many of the pros, in fact quite good.She was an invented character so could not see her lasting.Glad they at least Red Carpeted her once!

Come on "I heard you liked ships" line was great. Now if only Emilia started to improve her acting I might even enjoy the Meereen arc. Hell I didn't like Kit Harrington's acting for the three first seasons, but during this season he has been one of the highlights. The least that Emilia can do is the learn to control her lips and her eyebrows.
4034	Stannis Eats No Peaches	2014-05-06	Her writing has been a bit crap, but I also find her too stiff. It's fine to be stiff and authoritative when talking to her council, but when it was just her and Jorah I was expecting her to show a lot more vulnerability. Nope.

Having her find out that both Astapor and Yunkai have gone back to slavery, maybe something that important might have merited more than 2 or 3 lines between the two of them. Â Maybe she sits down? Puts her head in her hands, or, at least a change in her tone of voice?????

So, that puts it about 50/50 on the show and Emilia for a very unrewarding scene.
4038	The BlackBear	2014-05-06	What proof do you have of that? I take issue with the statement because it presumes there's something wrong with doing nudity. Why don't you get on Alfie Allen's case for whipping his wiener out in season 1?


I have no problem with nudity if there's a reason for it. Simply put there is a hell of a lot more female flesh on show, and a lot of the time there's absolutely no point behind it. It feels like they're insulting the intelligence of the viewer, like we won't keep watching unless we get a pair of breasts an episode.
Â 
Â 


TheBlackBear is speculating because at some point last year, mid-way through Season 3, Oona Chaplin said one of the actresses on the show refused to do nudity although she had previously done nudity on the show before. It became a news story and people were assuming it was Emilia because she hadn't been naked since Season 1 at that point. But then she got her kit off in 3x08 so it probably wasn't her.
Â 
It was most likely Sibel Kekilli. I've seen some horrible slut shaming comments about Sibel online. People saying she should go back and do porn because that's all she is good for. And you might not think Kekilli is a great actress but some of these comments were way out of line. I think TheBlackBear was also criticising the fact that female nudity is favoured more on the show overall than male nudity and there's an imbalance there (which TheBlackBear is not wrong about). He's criticising the sexism of it, not the actual nudity itself.


I recall reading it in a newspaper, presumably that's what it was.
Â 
Â 


...yet she doesn't seem to have a problem with her character ordering the crucifixion of 163 random people.
Â 
But of course, nudity is worse.


Just because a character is the type to order mass slaughter, doesn't mean they're also the type to just whip their tits out for no reason at all.

4040	AnotherCrannogman	2014-05-06	This is HBO. People watch for some skin.
4041	Alayne's Shadow.	2014-05-06	My opinion is that Emilia is certainly to blame, but the writers/directors are not helping her, at all. For one, they seem obsessed with "Dany is this badass even in private" which simply does not work. It gives an odd pacing to the scene. Where is Dany's self-doubt? Her emotion at knowing what happened to Yunkai and Astapor? Emilia tried to convey that, even for a bit, but it just seemed the script was pushing for "Stoic/Regal Dany". That said, Emilia seems so wooden in those scenes. I had at first found extremely awkward Dany's reaction to the slave children crucified, and she uses almost the same expression for this scene.
4042	KhalDrewby	2014-05-06	This is my first TV season after finishing the books (I read them before Season 3 and 4). I can say that Danaerys went from my favorite character (on screen) to my least favorite (on screen). I don't mind her book character but the TV show character is just so rude and snappy compared to the book character, merely a young girl.Â
4043	Ser Oromus Locke	2014-05-06	Pretty much..Same goes for Kit Harrington


Â 
While I agree with the majority here and find utter disgust of Emilia's performance in this episode and a few ones back as well, I must disagree with Kit Harrington having equally bad delivery. He's better then okay, just not spectacular unless the material is right.

Bear in mind in the books, you have the benefit of Dany's thoughts, you see all the doubts etc she has. In the show that is harder to convey, if the writers/directors have chosen to at all.And regardless of what you think of her, Dany in the books is hardly a young girl by the Meereen chapters. It's the tragedy of her character, that such a noble act, has such unproductive and dangerous results.

4046	AnotherCrannogman	2014-05-06	LOL. Your intelligence may be insulted but for most a bit of titillation adds to the show. Deadwood was one of the best written shows ever on TV but it likely would have ended sooner if a large part of the storyline did not center on whorehouses. Sex is a primary genetic drive for mammals and you are a mammal as are all the other viewers.

It's only 'insulting to one's intelligence' if you start with the belief that nudity has no place in the story except to attract attention.

If you don't start with that belief, then it's not insulting at all.

That was one of his best scenes. That said, Kit is certainly not a good actor. Season 2 and 3 proved that. But I think he's passable. Maybe now he's better because he's older and more experienced.

Â 
o Dany really did seem like she had been spending some time with Prince Valium
Â 
o The best Daario can do is, "I heard you liked ships" -- and why was that even a conversation? Â Newsflash, Dany: you just took over a city, part of that means taking control of its military, and part of that is it's navy.
Â 
o Barristan thinking attacking King's Landing with 10K foreign troops is a good idea?

4052	Addam of Hull	2014-05-06	I think Harrington is about as good as the material he gets.Â  In season 2 and much of season 3 his material was pretty crap, so that was a problem.

Yeah, I think that's fairly accurate.  Season 2 is especially bad.  Jon has one of the weaker storylines in Clash to begin with, which isn't an inherently bad thing, but a good chunk of the alterations made it significantly weaker.  It's also worth noting that Jon, as a character, isn't meant to be particularly expressive and he's a fairly passive character for a good chunk of the story which do contribute.  Kit's not a terrible actor, but he also wasn't stellar enough to deal with some of the weaker material he's given.
4053	Gendrys Forge	2014-05-06	I once saw a collage on here of about a dozen pictures of dany from different episodes with the same facial expression, does somebody know what im talking about?Â  Could you post it, ive tried finding it with no luck.
4054	Nictarion	2014-05-06	Â 
It would have to be both, right? Â It's clear the show sees her as Targaryen Jesus and I'm coming to the realization that my personal negative view of Ms. Targaryen may not be shared by GRRM and she may end up the savior figure afterall...so, if they're vested in this view of her, they are more likely to be okay with the Regal All The Time personna. Â Otherwise, they would give her different direction.
Â 
A better actress would probably be able to imbue those scenes with more depth without different direction. Â I'm always amazed at how Dance kills Tywin and hasn't read the books, yet he still evokes that arrogance and ruthlessness without making him a one note villian perfectly.
It's definitley not shared by GRRM, see the 2:18 mark of this video.http://www.youtube.c...h?v=EHFOepy7rJw

4055	TheRatCook	2014-05-06	I agree with what another poster said...she is a stage actress, who hasn't adequately made the leap to TV.
4056	Caerl Targaryen	2014-05-06	Actors can only do so much with the material they're given. Other than her season 1 material and some material from last season, they haven't exactly been giving Emilia the strongest material or many scenes to work with. They also have a habit of giving her some of the dumbest lines (e.g., "Yes, all men must die. But we are not men.")Â and over-the-top scenes in the series (e.g., the Yunkai slaves lifting her into the air) that would have been drastically improved if they had just stuck to the source material and not tried to Hollywood-ize it.
Â 
I think she's doing fine with what they're giving her. When they actually give her good material, she really excels. When they don't, she does decently enough.

That's why our brains have the ability to detect when someone is displaying their own opinion. It's unnecessary to begin every statement with "in my opinion." It should be implied.
4063	Night'sQueen	2014-05-07	Hodor's actor can say only one word...... and yet manages to but so many different emotions into that word.

4064	MadQueenAmberTargaryen	2014-05-07	I personally, agree that she peaked earlier though I also think a lot if it had to do with the directing as well. Are they dead and blind?? I won't lie, sometimes Emilia gives me chills and brings a good representation but sometimes I just want to fly out to location and do it my damn self lol
4065	Natalia Borgia	2014-05-07	She has the range of Shaquille O'Neil. Â 


Don't be hard on Shaq! Shazzam was awesome.Â
4066	Night'sQueen	2014-05-07	I agree with those who have said Emilia is being given shitty material and perhaps lacking good direction. Kit suffered the same problem, but this season his acting is miraculously improving because the writing for his character is better.
Also, both characters have many POV chapters where they don't get to express their true selves to those around them through dialogue, only to the reader through inner monologue. It's challenging to flesh them out fully on screen to the satisfaction of readers. The non-book people I know who are fans of the show are generally fans of both Dany and Jon and have no complaints about the acting. 
Has anyone seen Emilia in anything else, by the way? Or Kit for that matter?
4067	Night'sQueen	2014-05-07	Don't be hard on Shaq! Shazzam was awesome.

Â 
The issue isn't detecting a display of opinion, but rather whether people who make assertions about subjective matters realize they're expressing opinion, not reality. It's extremely common for people not to realize that, so to assume otherwise is to my mind irrational. Critics have built an entire profession out of false objectivity. A massive awards show industry revolves around it. Sure, some critics, voters and viewers realize it's all subjective, but in my experience a vast majority do not. When I see assertive, haughty derision directed at a creative effort, and with zero expression of humility, I'm inclined to take people at their word.

Emilia did fine in Season 1 ( all of her scenes with Harry Lloyd were great) I don't think there is another actor who has the same chemistry with her as Khal Drogo ( I can't remember the actor's name it is early and have had no coffee) and Viserys which has affected her performance immensely IMO.Â

No I am not an actor but I have watched Inside the Actors Studio for years and did plays until high school. Am I qualified to critique her cringe worthy performances?Â

Her range is as limited as Dwight Howard's offense. And Shaq's jump shot range if given sub par material- she also seems to be an actress who needs to play off others ( solo scenes not her deal) because her facial expressions can be too wooden as she is playing super awesome badass Khaleesi.Â

Other I read somewhere was that EsmA© Bianco did her share of nudity season 1, maybe 3 or 4 or more times.
She did not want to die in the nude in season 3, they accommodated her.
I miss Bianco, at first I thought she was a third string actress who would do the sexposition scenes... but even in season 1 I noticed she could act. Then she turned out to be the equal of many of the pros, in fact quite good.
She was an invented character so could not see her lasting.
Glad they at least Red Carpeted her once!


Red carpeted is a euphemism?

4090	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-07	Emilia has been cast in the new Terminator movie, which would have to be pretty awful to be received worse than Pompeii.


Â 
If she's one of the Terminators this is actually brilliant casting.
4091	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-07	Schwarzenegger seriously used to mention in interviews that the Terminator role was challenging in the sense that it was supposed to be monotonous and unemotional.Â  Normally being wooden is a bad thing for an actor and directors/coaches are going to try and break you of that bad habit but suddenly here's one role that requires you do what you're always being told not to do.
Â 
So everything about Emilia's portrayal of Dany we're bemoaning here would be advantageous when portraying a murderbot.
4092	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-07	Isn't she playing Sarah Conner?
I find Dany in the show a bit hideous to watch. 
Permanent thousand yard stare. 
Constantly giving monologues. 
Never really listening to Ser Grandfather. 
Maybe she is gonna be the Mad Queen after all. I hope so. 
Be brilliant watching the Unsullied hero become a bad guy. Wonder how the show will handle it? If it happens obviously.
4093	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-07	She was at her best in the one Dany scene I really cared about seeing translate well from book to show (Dracarys!) so I don't have as much of a problem with her performance as my participating in this thread implies 
Â 
But I do think we're at the point in the story, with Dany settling in to rule -- and learning the hard way recurring theme of this story, that Winning isn't the same as Ruling and being good at one doesn't automatically make you good at the other -- where Dany starts to get really interesting.Â  It stops being easy for her.Â  She starts having to make hard ruler decisions.Â  Unpleasant compromises.
Â 
I've repeatedly mentioned that I really like Kit Harrington's run as Jon because he seems to be hitting his stride right at the same time Jon Snow starts to really be interesting (whereas in the first couple seasons/books he doesn't interest me as much).Â  He was, as the internet joke goes, just standing around with his mouth hanging open.Â  Now he's actually getting to do and say stuff!Â  I think -- I hope, anyway -- that a similar thing is about to start happening with the Dany role.Â  That it's about to start demanding more, and thus become a lot more fun to play.Â  Especially if, as you and others guess, Dany is ultimately making a slow heel turn.Â  Descent Into Madness/Villanry is hella fun to play, from what I've heard actors in general say [MacBeth!] so I want to think she's possibly on the verge of hitting her stride, too.
Â 
Also, due to the dragons she has to interact with CGI/stuff that isn't really there more than anyone else on the show.Â  I hadn't really thought about that before (or seen it mentioned here, maybe it has and I just missed it) but it's hard to have a natural looking, emotionally-engaged reaction with something that isn't really there.Â  Particularly since she started as a stage actress, and reacting/interacting with other performances and the audience is what it's all about.Â  Maybe that's a factor.
4094	Sirar Salih	2014-05-07	For some reason, the only time I liked DaenerysÂ was in the first season. Innocence fit her much more in my opinion.
4095	Gogossos	2014-05-07	I think there's a lot of mixing up of Dany's character with Emilia's talent in this thread. What exactly do you expect Dany to be doing in these scenes? With Viserys she was terrified, vulnerable and fearing for her personal safety. And Emilia showed that. Now Dany doesn't exactly fear anyone, injury-wise, because she has Barristan, Jorah and her bloodriders always protecting her person. So you're never going to see that kind of vulnerability in Emilia's performance. Many have mentioned how good she's been when commanding the Unsullied, well doesn't learning a fake language and acting it out prove the actress's talent? There's a lot of criticism of her voice tone, but given that she's already proven her range, don't you guys think this is a deliberate choice on Emilia's part? So the question should be, is that the right choice? Slating her abilities as an actor, whilst conveniently ignoring what she's done in S1 in particular, I think it's a tad too unfair.
Â 
Obviously a wrong choice was made in S2, when they had Dany huffing and puffing, shouting loudly at every given opportunity that she's the mother of dragons to a very dismissive Qarth audience. That wasn't the impression I got from the books, where even though she still asked for ships and money it still read as a verbal sparring, playful banter with men who easily shed a tear. Â Last season and this, mainly because of the "myhsa" scenes, they toned down her "I'm the blood of Valyria" declarations. It's not needed anymore (and I argue it was never needed).
Â 
I've just rewatched the scene from this episode that everyone's criticising. It's funny coz since I was now paying close attention to her performance I caught some of the subtler aspects of it. She starts the whole scene playfully but respectful, receiving news of Joffrey's death and questioning her counsellors of the available options. She uses a fake stern voice at Daario's capture of the boats, then looks away from him, smiling just a touch, when he responds. (In the books, at this stage, she likes him but knows she shouldn't - this season her interactions with Daario have had this undercurrent. Like with the flower scene a few episodes back). Her whole demeanour changes when Jorah tells her news from Astapor and when everyone else leaves, she maintains a seriousness - and sadness - and at how her freed people seem to be backsliding into slavery. When Jorah tells her "she's the mother of dragons" she doesn't seem to take pleasure in that, insisting she needs to be more than that. The conclusion from my little rewatch is this: Emilia is talented, but many readers don't seem to like Dany at all and therefore don't pay attention to either EC's performances or Dany's various inner turmoil from the books. But not liking a character shouldn't mean dissing the talent of the actor portraying that character. Those are two separate things.
4096	Adam_Up_Bxtch	2014-05-07	To be fair when Dany is told of Joffrey's death her facial expression seemed to be of her pretty much thinkingÂ "that isÂ good" it would of been really weird and not like her to give a huge stoic creepy smile after Jorah says "King Joffrey is dead". Although I feel Emilia is trying to play Daenerys off as a stern queen that's what I get from seeing her use not as much emotion. Although I'll admit some stuff she says is cringe worthy. Before she catapults those slave collars in Meereen when she isÂ thinking of who should be her championÂ the line she says to Jorah was a little weird and felt too forced in my opinion. Still my 2nd favorite character in the series.....
4097	sj4iy	2014-05-07	Well I'm curious why everyone ignores there is in fact a lot of male nudity on the show as well. It's not like it's just women.Because it's a double standard. If a woman is naked, it must be degrading and insulting...but if a man is naked, it's not.I find it ridiculous myself, tbh. I actually find it more insulting that other people feel the need to tell me what I should be insulted by. I'm not bothered by nudity, sex or even rape in a fictional show. I save my outrage for the real thing.
4098	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-07	I think there's a lot of mixing up of Dany's character with Emilia's talent in this thread. What exactly do you expect Dany to be doing in these scenes?

Â 
You know, now that you mention it, that's probably it.Â  Dany (the character) has less emotional range now than she did in Season 1.Â  So that creates the illusion that Clarke's performance range is regressing when it actually isn't [again, she's going, at least I think she is, for Stiff Upper Lip At All Times, which suits Dany right now because she's trying to be a queen and that means looking strong and being in charge and not looking weak/making excuses.Â  She can't show the mask cracking if the writers/directors don't give her any If I Look Back I am Lost s to deliver.]Â  Particularly when contrasted with Kit Harrington and Sophie Turner, whose characters are doing (and need to do) the opposite over the past couple years [and I rave about them on here for it].
Â 
So yeah, fingers crossed that as Dany struggles to rule Clarke will get to do more than Just Be Stoic, and it's all just around the corner.

That's because that was the only time she wasn't one dimensional.
4100	Gogossos	2014-05-07	Thank you Sour Robin, that succinctly puts across what I was trying to say. Dany - outwardly at least - has less range to show now than at the beginning of the series. Of course, she will have more turmoil as ruling becomes difficult and she grapples with compromises she doesn't like. So Emilia should have more fun with that.

Â 
That's a pretty big assumption, as if you're trying to dismiss the opinions of those who aren't Dany fans.Â  It's also an assumption that does not work if you read the thread;Â  there are vocal Dany fans who disapprove of her acting this episode.

4103	HelenaExMachina	2014-05-07	Emilia isn'tÂ  bad actress imo. Wasn't a massive fan of her this episode, but she wasn't awful. Could have been because of the lines etc she had to deliver. However, I was very impressed with many of the other actors and actresses in this episode, so maybe I am just judging her harshly based on that.
Still, as long as I find her better than Aidan Gillen she is in the safe zone. He's pretty appalling this season imo
4104	The Fenris Wolf	2014-05-07	I don't think that she's a particularly good actress, and I think there's no reason that I can't make that subjective statement. Â I've been watching movies and television my entire life and I would think at this point I can tell the difference. Â No one gets in an argument over Chuck Norris' acting, or Paris Hilton's. Â How ridiculous would it be to get all defensive any time someone said that Paris Hilton's acting in House of Wax was terrible? Â It just was, by any legitimate standard. Â I mean she was able to stand in the position required, and presumably she remembered her lines well enough to repeat them on camera. Â Beyond that I couldn't detect any skill or craft whatsoever.
Â 
I should not have to watch scenes with her two or three times to pick out the overly subtle emotions she's trying to bring across. Â That's her job as an actress, to bring those emotions across to me, the viewer. Â Is some of it the fault of the writing team and the director? Â Of course. Â Not being an industry insider I can still assume that there are lots of folks responsible for each scene coming to fruition. Â But again to use my Paris Hilton example, no one blames the director of the movies she's in for her performance.
Â 
The episode before last had a great example. Â The Daario Naharis (sp?) character had a scene with her, where he was showing her all these flowers he had picked for her and was flirting with her. Â She came across like a robot with a stick up her ass. Â Why? Â Would it be so terrible to show just a little emotion? Â At no time do I ever lose myself in any of her scenes. Â I'm just gritting my teeth waiting for them to end. Â Such a shame too, it's not like there aren't a million and one starving actresses out there.
4105	Newstar	2014-05-07	Still, as long as I find her better than Aidan Gillen she is in the safe zone. He's pretty appalling this season imo


Â 
I never know if my problems are with Aidan Gillen's acting or just with his ever-shifting accent. On the other hand, he's hardly the worst offender in the accent department--although I guess you could say Peter Dinklage is at least consistently sticking with one accent, no matter how atrocious it is--so it seems unfair to single him out for blame for the accent alone.
Â 
On another note, I do think it's possible to be a subtle actor and convey one's acting abilities even with unsubtle or even horrible writing, though. I don't know what defence it is to blame the writing for bad acting. There's been a lot of questionable writing to go around in this series, and Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington are hardly the worst off in the writing department; the mark of quality is who can sell it and who can't.
4106	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-07	My opinion is that Emilia is certainly to blame, but the writers/directors are not helping her, at all. For one, they seem obsessed with "Dany is this badass even in private" which simply does not work. It gives an odd pacing to the scene. Where is Dany's self-doubt? Her emotion at knowing what happened to Yunkai and Astapor? Emilia tried to convey that, even for a bit, but it just seemed the script was pushing for "Stoic/Regal Dany". That said, Emilia seems so wooden in those scenes. I had at first found extremely awkward Dany's reaction to the slave children crucified, and she uses almost the same expression for this scene.Yeah,where is the vulnerability and self doubt??
4107	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-07	As an aspiring actor I am very very nitpicky when acting is concerned so whoever told me that directors guide actors...umm, yes, I know that...everyone knows that. However a better director/writer for her character would tell her to show more emotion at the childrens death, the killing of masters and hearing the news of yunkai and astapor, but really...we are seeing an ice queen. And a better actress, would incorporate these things without having to hold the directors hand.
4108	Jorah the Explorer	2014-05-07	Emilia Clarke hit the jackpot, I think. Â There are a lot of stars that aligned to get her to where she is now: on top of most desirable lists, etc. Â First the series had to be conceived, then the original pilot had to fail to meet HBO's expectations, then the recast pilot with her as Daenerys had to be given the green light, then the show had to become a huge success. Â This despite her having questionable acting skills, as evidence by this thread. Â She does look fantastic in a blonde wig and tanned skin though, I'm sure that is an objective viewpoint.
4109	avernite	2014-05-07	I rewatched the episode on HBO go, and I think it's actually more that (apart from the atrocious discussion about the ships) we only remember the catchy lines. There IS some doubt and even vague hints of despair when she first talks to Jorah, only later moving into her putting her queenly mask back on.
Â 
Of course, it's obviously not memorable (I only noticed because I was deliberately looking out for it), so it could (should?) improve, but it's not all one emotion only.

Â 
Yes, a few others noted this previously. I even posted the specific dialogue and a time-stamped clip of her expressing doubt and a fear of inadequacy, but it was completely ignored because it doesn't fit the narrative of her "overacting" and having a "delivery [that] is the same no matter what words she's speaking." Whether she sufficiently expressed vulnerability is subjective but it's objectively true that her delivery in that moment was different from her transition back toward the steely resolve of a queen.

Aidan Gillan has been fantastic in pretty much everything he's been in. I don't think it's his ability that's the problem. You just don't, as an actor change your accent on a personal whim. It must be a command from on high. Probably the show runners rather than directors. I'm surprised that they haven't thought to include one line of dialogue to explain it though.Â  How hard would it be for Sansa to casually question the change and for him to give a one line explanation. 5 seconds of screen time? I don't know why they didn't do that.Â 
Â 
I quite like Peter Drinklage's accent. He reminds me somewhat of Ronnie Corbett . And not just because of the height.

While im not an actor myself, i appreciate truly good acting more than a lot of people. Im also one who thinks a little bit of ham and cheese is acceptable. However, i agree with you completely. Emilia Clarke is entirely tooÂ forcedÂ and doesnt seem to know how to convey what Dany is feeling. I thought it was because she didnt understand the character very well, but that really isnt true. Shes read the books, she knows what Dany is thinking and feeling during these moments. She justÂ doesnt have the fucking chops to convey this!Â Harington has the chops to convey what Jon is thinking and feeling. We are seeing that much and that he was the victim of the writers. But Dany has had prime material for many seasons now. Theres no excuse for the mediocrity that we are getting from her.Â She stays afloat by being hammy in scenes that call for it. But the scenes like the one in this episode, shes a fucking dead fish.Â 
Â 
What are the directors doing? Saying "its ok, good try. We'll print." and patting her on the back for being dry as a bone?Â
4113	Nami	2014-05-07	My problem with him is his batman voice, not the accent.
4114	Gogossos	2014-05-07	Â Such a shame too, it's not like there aren't a million and one starving actresses out there.


Â 
And how many of them have Emmy nominations? Lord knows we are dealing with subjective opinions here but I find the comparison to Paris Hilton bizarre to say the least.Â 
Â 
The episode before last had a great example. Â The Daario Naharis (sp?) character had a scene with her, where he was showing her all these flowers he had picked for her and was flirting with her.

Â I'm just gritting my teeth waiting for them to end.
Â 

Â 
That stiffness (or aloofness) you talk about? That was deliberate. At this point in time, Dany likes Daario well enough but she's not about to admit that to him. She's not going to be laughing at his jokes and touching his chest, yet. That's why I think they recast the role, because Daario 1.0 was basically eye-fucking her whereas I think they've now opted for a more muted route. Daario 2.0 charms her, with a twinkle in his eyes. I likened it to an undercurrent because it's not meant to be too obvious, at least for now. In my opinion, of course.
Â 
I should not have to watch scenes with her two or three times to pick out the overly subtle emotions she's trying to bring across. Â That's her job as an actress, to bring those emotions across to me, the viewer.
Â 

Â 
I noticed it because I was looking for it. That's the definition of subtle, it's there but partially hidden, not in full view. It's an actress putting little layers to her performance that reward a second or third viewing. When GRRM does it in print form we call him a genius. When Emilia does it on screen, well "she's not doing her job well enough".Â

On the other hand, there are actors like Michael Cera who always appear to be the exact same character no matter the role.Â  I don't know if they are just "acting themselves," or have a schtick and are sticking to it.Â  Of course, I've found Mr. Cera to be pretty entertaining in Arrested Development and Scot Pilgrim, so this isn't necessarily a bad thing.Â 
Â 
For example, Chuck Norris doesn't really act or show emotion, but he can roundhouse kick and has a certain gravitas about him: https://www.youtube....h?v=VsabFEisZ2Y .Â

Or, there is the Arnold Schwarzenegger route, skirting on sheer charisma.Â  Guy mispronounces half the English language, but everyone just likes him.Â  He seems like he's having fun and it is infectious.Â  Plus, muscles, I guess: https://www.youtube....h?v=pDxn0Xfqkgw .Â  Guy was one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood, but I don't think anyone would ever put him into a serious, or any movie that aimed for realism.Â

Â 
Which brings me to Emilia Clarke.Â  When you need angry shouting, she can deliver.Â  This season, however, when asked to have a conversation she just reminds me of Dean Lerner.Â  It doesn't sound like a conversation, it sounds like somebody reading off a ophthalmologist chart.Â  She doesn't have to be a great actress to give a great performance, but there is just something "off" about her.Â  Like she's playing to much attention to stage directions.Â  Or, that she's high.Â  I suspect for some people, she has that charisma that lets beautiful, outgoing people succeed even when they aren't really doing anything special.Â

A.G. was outstanding on, "The Wire" and other projects he has appeared in. Â In his case I think Littlefinger may not be the correct role for him. Because he's a better actor than he has been on all 4 seasons on this show. I don't know if it is D and D or the directors, who knows?
4119	RoamingRonin	2014-05-07	Emilia is pretty one note. It's quite vexing because she isn't a terrible actress. I can't say it's the script or the directors because other actors are doing more with less to work with. Take Lena Headey for instance. She does so much when she has only a few lines. Both Emilia and Lena have a great understanding of their book counterparts but Lena is incredible while Emilia leaves so much to be desired.Â 
The scene where she decides to stay in Meereen was awful. No emotion regarding the Butcher King. No emotion about declaring herself queen. This was a pivotal moment and... *raspberry* it fell flat.Â

Since film captures every little detail I guess that it would be harder to convince the audience that the emotions the actor displays are genuine. On stage you can use your voice and gestures, nobody (maybe except people sitting in the front rows?) are really upclose judging every facial expression of the actor.

4129	Domonju	2014-05-08	You know I wouldn't limit this to just Emilia Clarke. I think the performances from many of the actors have gotten worse as the seasons have progressed. Season 1 was the highlight season. Now as the show gets ever more popular, it seems that a certain level of complacency has kicked in.
Â 
Be honest, why has GoT made the news this year? Is it because of great acting? Peter Dinklage getting rave reviews? No. It's been all about whether Jaime did or did not rape Cersei.

But i don't think you can heap all the blame the actors for this. It is ultimately down to D&D. They OK all the scripts, they OK all the scenes, they OK the final product. This show is THEIR vision. Anything you see on the screen is what they ultimately thought would be the best to portray to the audience.
Â 
Granted, some actors can make even their subpar dialogue seem more interesting, but as a whole I believe that the material that is being produced has been getting weaker season after season.
Â 
I also believe that as the fantasy element within the story increases the show will get even worse because D&D just suck at fantasy. They become like Michael Bay disciples.Â
4130	PatrickStormborn	2014-05-08	As an aspiring actor I am very very nitpicky when acting is concerned so whoever told me that directors guide actors...umm, yes, I know that...everyone knows that. However a better director/writer for her character would tell her to show more emotion at the childrens death, the killing of masters and hearing the news of yunkai and astapor, but really...we are seeing an ice queen. And a better actress, would incorporate these things without having to hold the directors hand. 


Â 
I mostly agree with this... But I think the problem is that the showrunners/directors want a specific Daenerys - a badass queen and little more.
Â 
We know that Emilia has read the books multiple times and even brings them onto the set with her. In the scene from the latest episode it's even possible to see exactly where she's taken influence from the book; the "turning away and speaking, turning back, turning away again" is what she does in the book, for example. And when Jorah tells her of the fall of Astapor, her expression is exactly the same as book Dany: she's totally unsurprised - it's just another Eroeh all over again. But the problem is that the show doesn't convey this - and although Emilia's performance is extremely important, nuances like this can't be conveyed by just acting alone. Would it have been hard for the showrunners to find an extra 30 seconds for this scene, during which Dany could explain how she feels. Why not reference the Lahazereen women who she tried (and failed) to save? Why not mention the Red Waste and how she couldn't protect her people (one of the reasons she doesn't march)? After they altered the Qarth storyline, why not mention her inability to save those who died there?Â 
Â 
TL;DR... I think we can all agree that Emilia is far from the best actress on the show. She can be weak at times, but she can also be good. But I also think that Emilia brings it to another level - she knows the books, she understands the character. The directors and the showrunners should be using this to their advantage instead of ignoring it. IMO part of the reason her performance looked weak in this episode is because she was trying to convey more than the script was allowing her to. I know people have compared her performance to Iain Glen's, but that's not really fair - the writing allows him to convey everything he needs to (jealousy, pride/possessiveness, treachery, love). But what exactly did the script allow Emilia to convey? Self-doubt and Badass Queen. That's it. And that's all they've been going for since season two.

4131	Woel	2014-05-08	I really don't see why people pick this particular episode to complain on her acting. I think she conveyed a lot of emotion, although subtle, when getting the news from Yunkai and Astapor. Look for example how she turns away as to not show her reaction, which I think conveys a lot of restrained sadness and frustration. "My liberation of Slaver's Bay..." was maybe a tad too ironic for Dany's personality, but I think there is tiredness and grief in the way she delivers the line.
Â 
Regardless, I will admit that the last line with "I will rule" at the end was really cheesy, and that she sounds like she is in a commercial for LancA´me or something. It was a bad line, and the delivery was weird, but it is just one line of many. I can see how a final line affects how people view the scene as a whole, but I don't think it should.
Â 
I think a lot of this comes down to peoples' expectation on women. If we had a male character liberating Slaver's Bay and receiving news of how wrong it had gone, how would you expect him to react to those news in a serious meeting? Would you expect him to look heart-stricken and on the verge of tears? For some reason I don't think so.

4133	sj4iy	2014-05-08	You know I wouldn't limit this to just Emilia Clarke. I think the performances from many of the actors have gotten worse as the seasons have progressed. Season 1 was the highlight season. Now as the show gets ever more popular, it seems that a certain level of complacency has kicked in.

Â 
Â 
It might only be boring to us? The TV only viewers may not care that she's the badass fire queen all the time. Â But, sooner or later the utter stiffness and sameness of the recent performances where she has exactly the same demeanor and voice intonations no mater where she is or what she's taking about will register with the entire audience and this is especially true because she gets so much screen time. Â Bran doesn't necessarily need to be a great actor because he doesn't do much in terms of emotion...he slogs around the North, that's about it, much less demanding. Â Kit and Emilia's characters call for a lot more range.
4135	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-08	I always defended Kit as well, lol, and still think hes doing a good job.

Â 
Â 
He's improved a lot this season, maybe his feature film helped him w/his skill set. Â He, too, I thought was good in the first season, and then dropped in quality.
Â 
My other theory about the show and how some people's acting has declined or gotten glitcky since season 1 is that they had a lot more time with it and that with the disparate locations, logistics and everything else now in the later seasons...some of the basics...have suffered.
Â 
I can't either quite figure out how the "director" is directing everyone...is she really going from Croatia to Ireland to Iceland or are what we're really seeing is the second team doing the camera work and the director cutting at least some of the segments? Â Same with the wrting..we see all the time that GRRM wrote X episode but then it comes out that he didn't write "all" of the segements...which if they do this all the time no doubt accounts for a lot of the inconsistencies we see. Â But, I don't know, this is pure speculation.

I agree with you about Kit but I think season 2 saw a drop in a lot of actors abilities, which upon seeing their ability back again I can only really attribute to poor writing or directing. How many directors work on this show? I know they only list one director per episode but I dont think its true that there IS only one director considering all the different locations that can be found in one episode alone.

Are you joking with this comment? None of what I've read regarding this scene or Emilia's acting in general has come down to our notions on how the different sexes would react. You're the first person I've seen try to bring this up, and frankly it's ridiculous. You do realize a lot of the posters here are women as well, right? When they are also critiquing Emilia's performance your argument about perceptions of women kind of fall flat. This is not an issue of gender expectations, nor should you try to make it one.

4139	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-08	Traditionally the difference between stage acting and small screen acting is that stage actors tend to make sweeping gestures and exaggerated facial movements so that the audience sitting in the theater can better see what's going on. This is usually known as ham acting or hammy acting and doesn't come over well on the small screen with close ups.Think Alan Rickman in Die Hard or Robin Hood or Lawrence Olivier in especially some of his early films. Just watch their faces, they're all over the place.
Â 
Wooden acting, barely changing your expression or tone of voice is like the opposite of stage acting. It's underplayed. It can I suppose be the result of a stage actor trying consciously NOT to do stage acting but I'd say it's more the result of laziness or not really being into the part.
4140	Cas Stark	2014-05-08	I've often wondered about the logistics of that as well due to all the different locations. I agree with you about Kit but I think season 2 saw a drop in a lot of actors abilities, which upon seeing their ability back again I can only really attribute to poor writing or directing.

Â 
Yeah, it seems impossible that one "director" would be flying to every location and directing each segment. Â It has to be that the second unit is doing some/most of the shooting in at least some locations. Â It would be interesting to know how they work it though.
Â 
I thought almost everyone's acting in the NW segments dropped off when they went to Iceland, that was in hindsight a poor choice all the way around, probably not worth the expense and the toll it took on the actors. Â 
Â 
And with Emilia, she was, I thought, a lot worse in season 2, then she was pretty good last season, and this season, eh, she's not bad, she sort of now is what she is, just very one notish. Â I rewatched her segment and it wasn't as bad the second time around, but still a bit jarring in several places and also really rushed for the level of importance of what they're conveying: Â her liberation campaign has gone to hell, that should be worth more than a handful of lines of dialogue.
4141	DaveyJoe	2014-05-08	The producers have stated that they try to have each director direct all of the scenes for their respective episodes. Â Sometimes scenes get shifted around in the editing process, but this helps maintain a consistent tone for each episode. Â So a production schedule might look like Alex Graves in one country filming all of his Night's Watch/Northern scenes of the season, then fly to the next location for all of the King's Landing scenes, and finally to the third location for all of the Essos scenes. Â It's just like a movie, where they shoot scenes out of chronological order.

4142	Gogossos	2014-05-08	At the risk of repeating myself, how else did people expect Dany to react in this scene? Smiling gleefully when told of Joff's demise? Outrageously flirting with Daario? And blowing her top at the news of the butcher king? That sounds like Viserys to me. I guess some of you are expecting to see the Mad Queen but I don't think that's the interpretation Emilia's going for.
Â 


Â 
We know that Emilia has read the books multiple times and even brings them onto the set with her. In the scene from the latest episode it's even possible to see exactly where she's taken influence from the book; the "turning away and speaking, turning back, turning away again" is what she does in the book, for example. And when Jorah tells her of the fall of Astapor, her expression is exactly the same as book Dany: she's totally unsurprised - it's just another Eroeh all over again. But the problem is that the show doesn't convey this - and although Emilia's performance is extremely important, nuances like this can't be conveyed by just acting alone.

After they altered the Qarth storyline, why not mention her inability to save those who died there?Â 


Â 
Basically, this. It's known Emilia is a consummate professional and one of the few "POV" actors to use the books to aid her performances. Now, tv/movie scripts don't tend to get published and read by millions, so an actor's performance becomes the only necessary interpretation of that character. But in a series like this, based on published books with multitudes of fans already in existence, the actor's interpretation is not the only one that exists. But as far as the tv show is concerned, it's probably the most important one, certainly the only relevant one in any case. So Emilia has studied the books, as much as the most ardent fan in here but her interpretation of Dany isn't the Mad Queen. She's nuanced and more muted, as PatrickStormborn has demonstrated. And I think that is jarring to some readers/viewers on this board, many of whom are wedded to the Mad Queen interpretation.
Â 


I really don't see why people pick this particular episode to complain on her acting. I think she conveyed a lot of emotion, although subtle, when getting the news from Yunkai and Astapor. Look for example how she turns away as to not show her reaction, which I think conveys a lot of restrained sadness and frustration. "My liberation of Slaver's Bay..." was maybe a tad too ironic for Dany's personality, but I think there is tiredness and grief in the way she delivers the line.

It was a bad line, and the delivery was weird, but it is just one line of many. I can see how a final line affects how people view the scene as a whole, but I don't think it should.


Â 
I totally agree. Emilia's not wooden, or one note, as is the apparent popular opinion on this thread. Subtle, nuanced? Yes; with quite a range of complex/conflicting emotions portrayed in one scene. But it is a quiet scene, with no music until the very end, she's not angry at anyone or ecstatic about something. The "I will rule line" is essentially the same in the books - it shouldn't come off stilted or weird or arrogant because really there's tiredness, and humility in a way, when she decides to stay.Â
4143	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-08	IMO, her lines were delivered with very little sincerity...not to sound cheesy, but Emila's performance did not make me believe that Dany actually made the sacrifice play of giving up westeros to rule meereen. it looked like Emilia was having an off day, so just did her lines as was expected of her...
Â 
i agree with the comment about Emilia generally being a consummate professional...maybe she just didnt agree with Dany's decision on this course of action and so couldn't pull if off sincerely? Â Â
4144	Nami	2014-05-08	Emilia is pretty one note. It's quite vexing because she isn't a terrible actress. I can't say it's the script or the directors because other actors are doing more with less to work with. Take Lena Headey for instance. She does so much when she has only a few lines. Both Emilia and Lena have a great understanding of their book counterparts but Lena is incredible while Emilia leaves so much to be desired.Â 
The scene where she decides to stay in Meereen was awful. No emotion regarding the Butcher King. No emotion about declaring herself queen. This was a pivotal moment and... *raspberry* it fell flat.Â 


Lena Heady? Really?
Since the first episode of season 1 she has the same acting in every scene.
4145	Hodor's Dragon	2014-05-08	You know I wouldn't limit this to just Emilia Clarke. I think the performances from many of the actors have gotten worse as the seasons have progressed.

I also believe that as the fantasy element within the story increases the show will get even worse because D&D just suck at fantasy. They become like Michael Bay disciples.Â 


Â 
Boy, I could hardly disagree more. Â I think the show was a little better in season 2 than season 1, a little better in season 3 than in season 2, and a LOT better in season 4 than in any previous season. Â The show has progressed by leaps and bounds this year in everything that makes for quality visual story-telling: better writing, better direction, better acting, better sets. Â Every week it is riveting.
Â 
The only thing that made this show popular the first year or two was a fantastic story that was hand-delivered to the producers with a bow around it + tits. Â They've still got the story, but they've upped the quality in every area of story-telling that can make a bad story good or make a good story great. Â They don't really even need the nudity any more, it's just a little extra ratings sauce.
Â 
I watched the first two episodes of season 1 recently. Â If you had read the books and already knew the story, there really wasn't all that much to recommend the show, at least unless you were a totally obsessed ASOIAF nerd like me and just wanted to nerd out on anything related. Â But now it is excellent TV, worthy to be considered with the best continuing shows in this Golden Age of television.

Agree 100% with this.
Also because season 1 we had a lot of actors "saving scenes". Mark Addy, Sean Bean and Harry Lloyd, for instance.
We had better actors stealing the scenes from not so good actors (aka saving scenes). Ie: Maisie Williams in the same scene with Kit Harrington.
The good actors are getting fewer and fewer.
Tbh, sometimes I think the Daenerys role is too much for Emilia to handle. That's what she's been showing, at least.

Sandor, Arya, Lysa, Sansa, Margaery, Tywin, Davos, SweetRobin, Theon, Ramsay, Jamie, Brienne, Olenna, Varys, Jojen,Meera, Bran, Locke, Karl....

4152	chrisdaw	2014-05-08	She's been shithouse for four and a half seasons, was anyone really expecting her to get good?

Â 
Anyway, regarding the point I was trying to make, I don't think you can blame the actors for everything. If they are getting bad material, they won't be able to make it good unless they are outstanding actors. Luckily a couple of actors (mostly Kit Harrington) seem to be growing into their roles, but others don't live up to it. I know there will be people who disagree and others who agree, but the discussion is interesting either way. :-)

Woooow 

Â 
Tbh, sometimes I think the Daenerys role is too much for Emilia to handle. That's what she's been showing, at least.

the impression i get. This is it. Cuz really, we are seeing Sophie Turner roflstomp as Sansa. In episode 2, she freaking destroyed and she had like maybe two lines. Sansa is a pretty damn nuanced character and Sophie plays her like her book counterpart. (albeit slightly more vocal) So i see Clarke and she looks like shes trying real hard now that shes read all the books, but it still looks like she bit off far more than she can chew. The directors look to be a bit inconsistent with how to handle her as well. Combo = a dry ass Dany.
4158	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-09	Simply not true at allAgreed. Lena is fantastic.
4159	Red Tiger	2014-05-09	I really wish Natalie Dormer was cast as Danaerys.
4160	Raffles	2014-05-09	I'm wondering.. the people here who're critisizing Emilia's acting ability.. do they actually have the acting/production background to do so. It just strikes me as being very immature... akin to playground bullying. Kudos to those who support her, as well as the other actors.
4161	Tyrion1991	2014-05-09	OP
Â 
I don't think people are being quite fair in judging the scene and theres a bit of misunderstanding about certain scenes.
Â 
Â 
For example, the bit where she says "so why did you do it?". The point isn't to show Dany as a strong or stern leader following on from the previous episode. The point is to set up Daario's funny "I heard you like ships" joke. Emilias uncertain delivery represents that he is challenging her and shes not quite got a handle on him as he does things unexpectedly.
Â 
Then, the bit where she says "It appears my liberation of slavers bay isn't going according to plan". I actually felt she was being sarcastic here. Shes asked them to leave because she doesn't want to admit weakness in front of them, but is comfortable saying so in front of Jorah; however limited an admission. The sarcasm is that there is no plan. Notice how she turns away from her council when she learns that Yunkai and Astapor have fallen; shes not entirely comfortable admitting that she done goofed. So I think that explains her response.
Â 
Overall, she doesn't come across as being as friendly with Jorah and it turns into a speech towards the end. Part of the reason for that is that this IS a momentous decision that has huge ramifications for the entire series. The show makers have to be explicit about Danys motivations for staying in Meereen as they lack her internal POV and stress this as a big moment. Its further complicated by the fact that this decision is the final Daenerys chapter and is quite dramatically delivered to her council in that scene. So I think they wanted to lend a sense of moment and drama to it; even if that did compromise the other objective of stressing that she is close to Jorah. It does turn into a speech directed at the audience over why she is staying at Meereen rather than a conversation with one of her closest friends.Â 
Â 
Â 
So I don't think the problem is Emilia Clarkes acting at all. She has some quite good moments in this scene and I quite liked when Barristan describes them going to attack Kings Landing and she glances over at Jorah with that "Yes, lets do it. This is it; finally". look. I think its partly because in season 3 and 4 they have tried to focus on Dany as a Queen and this other worldly figure. IMO in season 1 and 2 where they show her more uncertain, vulnerable and prone to bouts of anger is a lot closer to where the character actually is in the books. They make her far too self controlled and aloof in the TV series. I don't even think she has ever given a speech in the books and far from being high spoken n polite shes actually kinda foul mouthed n blunt "its his city I want not his meager manhood" "I intend to drink wine of victory from the skull of the usurper".

4162	Sirar Salih	2014-05-09	I'm wondering.. the people here who're critisizing Emilia's acting ability.. do they actually have the acting/production background to do so. It just strikes me as being very immature... akin to playground bullying. Kudos to those who support her, as well as the other actors.

Oh, give me a break. Does it take a professional to see that someone is a horribly non-convincing character on a show?

Â 
That's a two-way street. Do the people applauding it have the necessary background? The people lukewarm towards it? If you can't judge an actor because you're not an actor yourself... then you can't judge the actor, good or bad.

Must we be chefs as well to judge the quality of food?
4165	Cyril	2014-05-09	I'll say it again:
It is the actor's job to convince the audience that the actor is the person whose role they're playing. The audience is meant to be the judge.Â  You do not need to be a professional to judge an actor, that entire argument is ridiculous.
Â 
If the audience does not find the actor sufficient, the actor is not doing his job.Â  Most humans are capable of reading voice, body, and facial expressions, as well as vocal tones, in milliseconds without even realizing they do so.Â  Anyone capable of this can judge an actor,

Since Natalie Dormer seems to be D&D's favorite ASOIAF character, I think it would've been a bad idea. We'd probably see Dany suggesting a threesome to Drogo, seducing his bloodriders, flirting with MMD, visiting Jorah at night, and so on.

Are you kidding me? Since when is criticizing someone's workÂ that is meant to be viewed and judged,Â discrimination? That's an insult to real forms of discrimination. You seem to completely miss the point of everything everyone is saying. SHE IS PAID TO BE IN THIS SHOW! SHE EARNS MORE MONEY THAN NEARLY ALL OF US EVER WILL. SHE SHOULD BE DAMN GOOD. If she didn't want to be put up to be judged on her ability, she shouldn't have agreed to be on a hugely popular TV show. Your arguments are ridiculous, and honestly, yes, you are wasting your time by saying this.

I can't be the only one who thinks this would make better TV than what we're probably going to be getting out of Dany's arc next season (sans her last scene). . .right?
4172	Frey Pies	2014-05-09	Why are book readers always the ones to criticize her? I've never seen unsullied say bad things about her acting. Emilia Clarke is great, in my opinion- she is coming off as arrogant this season, which is what I think she's supposed to do. They're building up her overconfidence really well. Her speech in Breaker of Chains was amazing!
Â 
Also, it seems to me most of the Dany hate comes from what happens to Dany in Meereen in the book. Well, GRRM royally screwed that up, not D&D. I can easily see them making a compelling arc for Danaerys in Season 5- her season 4 arc seems just fine  Also, the Unsullied will probably be excited about the convergence of Tyrion, Victarion, everyone else, etc who is going towards Dany next season (along with Daznakh's Pit), so I don't expect too much hate.Â

You're definitely not the only one. Many readers apparently have huge problems with Dany's ADWD chapters. I happen to be not one of them. Exactly the opposite: Dany's ADWD story fascinates me, both in ambition and execution - thematically, philosophically, characterization wise, plot wise... Production wise, it would be a challenge to film it, but dramatically it would be a delight to watch (for examples, dialogues are perfect there, in my opinion). But, if you dislike her ADWD arc, needn't worry. Knowing D&D, they're going to change it big time. And, regardless of the results, show-apologists are certainly going to hail it as yet another triumph of the show.

Margaery is in a position where her night visits to Tommen, her willingness to do anything to get a child by Renly etc., all serve to offer her and her family an advantage in the game. Benioff and Weiss have not always been perfect, but please, they deserve more respect than that.

We'd probably see Dany suggesting a threesome to Drogo, seducing his bloodriders, flirting with MMD, visiting Jorah at night, and so on.Well that true, Dormer just did not fit the character for season 1.Clarke was on GRRM's Dany wavelength season 1, I don't think Dormer could have done that, even tho I think she is a better actress.Trouble with Dany and season 2, is George's story in the Essos is very 'inner'. Lot's of thoughts and then visions and prophesying. They introduced Quaithe and then didn't know what to do with the character.All in all I don't think D&D were interested in Qarth and should have sought out a writer who could have solved the dramatic narrative , if such a writer and solution could have been found! It would have not been conventional story telling , I mean there would have been some non-linear-ity to it, don't know TV audiences are up to that.I enjoyed Dany's chapters in CoK but all the conventional story telling was in Westeros.Except E1, E2 and E10 they gave Clarke some awful dialog.... an actress like Eva Green could have spun that into something but, alas,Green does not fit the Dany role.In SoS , interestingly enough, GRRM shifted Dany into Alexander the Great mode, D&D finessed the events at Astapor better than George did, within the confines of fitting the story into the limited 10 episode constraint they have.I still think Clarke hit it out of the park with the Dracarys scene in episode 4.(One can always tell when D&D's turn their burners up, a chapter or scene of GRRM's that captures them.)All in all Clarke is just fine in the rest of season 3 except that GRRM had her plan the conquest Yunkai , while on the show she seems to just ok the infiltration plan.This season , seems the ploy of the conquest of Meereen was hers... and it's clever enough, but obviously budget driven, in the book , tho short, much more military action. However even in the books GRRM did not have her leading the troops Jeanne d'Arc style, still the Daenerys Targaryen of the books seemed like a quasi-Napoleon with a inexplicable talent for military success. Still , even in the books, George did'nt turn her into a character Eva Green should have played!(Or Cate Blanchett! Who just knocked me out with Elisabeth in 1998... o, well.)

Â 
They made her infinitely more manipulative, but not in a believable way. She is willing to have sex with both her husband and her brother simultaneously - AKA: a threesome - as soon as she saw the husband isn't aroused. Repeat: threesome with the husband and the brother. That's not only manipulative, that's disgusting. And anyone that disgusting is not really manipulative, because such caricatural perversion can't help but turn people away (except in badly written shows, of course).

I'm not talking about TV Marg's possible motives, but about what she actually suggests to Renly. Now, for comparison sake, just imagine Renly's having an affair not with Loras, but with Brienne. And then, one night, Margaery suggests to Renly to invite Brienne in, to help them with sex. Would it be disgusting? Most probably. I mean, not only that she doesn't mind him having an affair, but she's also willing to use his mistress and himself in some agenda of hers. Any real-life Renly would run away from the bitch as far as possible and as soon as possible. And now, just imagine how infinitely more disgusting Margaery's proposition becomes if, instead of Brienne, Margaery's brother is Renly's lover.
Â 
It doesn't get sicker than that, I'd say. And, speaking of the respect D&D deserve, I'm pretty sure they wrote Margaery's suggestion without ever realizing how disgusting it is. It's very telling of their writing competence. And I'm pretty sure TV Dany's better off without that kind of "adaptation". (Not that D&D are doing a good with TV Dany anyway.)

I think GRRM threads the spinning wheel too much. just talking written narrative here, but GRRM just nets me every-time with his story telling. Translating all that material into interesting visual narrative , I don't know. One is back into that problem they have had all along , even being economical, pounding 30 episodes of story material into 10 episodes.ADWD ends with a George ZINGER , but we can't get to that too fast, and if they get there half way through season 5, I sure hope Winds is finished by the end of this year!
	Spoiler I note something odd, this season, if a whole raft of unarmed slaves can overwhelm all the slave masters and their army (the Meereen army is not that clear in the books either!)... why can't they be empowered to do it again when there is a tread of revolt from within? Only a fraction of the slaves , even in the books, seemed to have turned on her.

Hmm, I don't know if I'd classify it as an affair when all parties are aware of it. So, is every threesome irl cheating on your partner, even if they are actually there and participating? Not really, honestly.

Real life is real life, but the way R+M+L was filmed, it seems Renly and Loras kept their relationship a secret from Margaery.

If you're not disgusted by it then you'd be a creep. Nevertheless I think it shows that Margaery is willing to do anything to beÂ The Queen.

As for the Brienne one, this one isn't reallyÂ that creepy. Margaery is fine with her husband having an affair, their relationship was hardly one built on love anyway. She's willing to use her husband's mistress as part of her agenda? Well see my previous comment, Margaery will do almost anything to advance her family's position. As for Renly, he can't run the other way, he needs the swords and money that come with Margaery's hand.

So we're suddenly supposed to accept mediocrity because 'it's her first shot' or something? That's no excuse. For the money she gets paid, and the very rare opportunity she has been given over many other young aspiring actresses, one would assume she would be great for the role. Â

Well, this is the dialogue that ensues once Renly can't proceed with the intercourse:
Â 
Margaery: Do you want my brother to come in and help?
Renly (shocked): What?!
Margaery: Or he can get you started? I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.

Now, I don't know if it's just incompetent writing, or perhaps D&D wanted for the audience to see Margaery as a despicable manipulator to whom literally nothing is sacred (which would've been an incompetent storytelling, considering what they've done with Margaery later on), but this scene can't help but paint her as a sick individual. And yes, at first she does suggest for Loras to join them. Her second sentence: "Or he can get you started?", means Loras would only get Renly excited and then leave. Now, I'm not sure it's practically possible, but OK, let's say that was on her mind. But, in that light, her first proposition means only one thing, as far as I can see. Her possible motives and ambitions help her in no way. I mean, Cersei's ambitions doesn't absolve her of anything, right? Why would Marg's absolve her, then?
Â 
As for Brienne, I already said it isn't that creepy, because she's not related to Brienne in any way. But, according to this dialogue, Renly is clearly surprised and disturbed his affair is known to Marg. And it's only natural he's disturbed. Whether his affair is with an unrelated woman or with his wife's brother, makes no difference in that regard - she's still playing with his emotions in a very cruel way.
Â 
(Not to mention the stupidity of Marg tutoring Renly about the ways of the court! How can TV Renly look like anything but a moron at that point? Like, wasn't he living in the court before the war, and not Margaery?!)
4192	Adam_Up_Bxtch	2014-05-09	Â 
Yeah, and that "different" is wrong.


Not really, what you guys expecting her to be the Mad Queen? Really? I don't think that's the kind of Queen she's trying to portray. and if she was to react with more emotion it just would of felt weird like when Jorah tells her of Joffrey's death if she was toÂ giveÂ a big smile it would of been both unnecessary and creepy, she just gave a little smirk which I accepted, because she's playing a stern queen, if she was to show a lot of emotion it just wouldn't seem right at all,
Â 
Jorah: King Joffrey is dead Khaleesi....
Dany: OH HAPPY DAY PRAISE THE GODS!!
Â 
no it just wouldn't of work so I think she did good with what was expected of her in the scene
4193	Miodrag	2014-05-09	As for Emilia, I'm not a fan of her acting abilities, but I have to give her some slack. With lines D&D keep writing for the character, no actress would shine. Just look at the ending scene of this season's episode three, when Meereen's champion comes out to challenge hers. The guys starts pulling his equipment out to take a leak, and she asks:
Â 
"What is he doing?"
Â 
What is he doing??!! Well, take a wild guess, sister! He is: A) about to send a raven; B ) flirting with Jorah; C) insulting your army by pissing in your direction. Take your time, khaleesi!

4194	targarayen	2014-05-09	I agree so much. I'm sick of Daenery's scenes. They're all just her shouting 'justice, justice'. We don't see any emotion like we do in the books. You don't see how she feels frightened and lonely, how she opens up to Jorah. It's all just too much. I don't know how they're going to do the scene where Ser Barristan reveals Jorah's original intentions, because he was never 'Whitebeard'. So that'll be interesting to see, I guess
4195	starklinson	2014-05-09	If anything, I actually think she overdoes her acting. She would be great on stage, but not really for screen. When she's supposed to be yelling/asserting/commanding she opens her mouth as wide as possible to do so. And she overdoes the "regal" thing and the "serious" face and when she's walking through the crowds in Meereen I get a more "most popular cheerleader in high school" as opposed to queen.
4196	Roose Seal	2014-05-09	Exactly, do these people not realize this is Emilia's FIRST big role in career? She's not even beenÂ acting that long Jesus Christ and people are acting like she's been acting like 20 years....Â I think she's doing fine, I've seen WAYYY worse actorsÂ  and I've seen a lot of movies and tv shows, I'll be going to school for acting real soon, and whileÂ I'll admit some stuff she says is cringe worthy, these guys are comparing her to people with 20+ years experience(Lena Headey) in the industry and expecting her to be as good it's ridiculous....Â 


Actually, upthread we were comparing her to Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner, neither of which had ever acted professionally prior to Game of Thrones and who have been consistently knocking it out of the ballpark since s1.Â 
Â 
Would you expect a baseball rookie to play poorly because it's his first season?
4197	boojam	2014-05-09	Nearly 20 entries here for a ship that has sailed.Emilia is there till the end.I am guessing Dany's story will carry through to novel 7.

This isn't really the thread for this, but I actually liked this change, and I saw it as a positive for Margaery. What's best for Renly is to get an heir, she accepts that he's gay and instead of judging him for it and trying to change him, she accepts it and tries to make it easier for Renly.
We clearly just read the scene in different ways (or I'm misunderstanding your point.)

Â 
But, a couple of episodes later, while talking with Littlefinger right by Renly's corpse, she says that next time around she want's to be The Queen. In hindsight, it hardly means she was thinking about Renly at all. But, if you ask me, we don't even need a hindsight, because the scene with Renly should be enough: talking so openly and in such a utilitarian manner about things Renly holds sacred (his relationship with Loras) is not the sign of a sympathy.
Â 
We agree on two points, though: 1) everyone's entitled to interpret the scene as one wants, and 2) this is too big a derail.
4201	Raffles	2014-05-09	We've gone off topic with Marg and Loris, regarding Renly.. but I'd like to add that I presumed brother and sister would BOTH be in there, with Loris getting things started and Marg finishing him off, with the overall intent of her getting pregnant. I took her agenda to be one of "ok.. my husband is gay, but we DO need a child.. and fast!!" which is honourable of course. Also, to call her sick would be to forget about the Targaryan's and their antic's through the ages, as well as good old Cersei and Jaime. They're all at it, all deviant.. so let's just sit back and enjoy the show
4202	Cas Stark	2014-05-09	It is an odd quirk that in a show full of great acting, two of the weakest actors in the show, Kit and Emilia, are in for the long haul.

I feel this is a bit of a cop out response tbh. As I explained in post 317 . It did used to be very true that stage actors could struggle on screen. But not in the way that Emilia Clarke seems to be. I don't think it's as true now with the medium of television and cinema having over taken stage plays for a long time now. Someone who has been to drama school would have been trained in both genres. The short version of what I said in 317 is that stage actors tend to exaggerate rather than underplay their parts. I don't think Emilia is over acting her part. Unless you think that she is overplaying the part?

She isn't overplaying or underacting, she'sÂ playing the part how I expect her to, she's a Queen andÂ Queen'sÂ are suppose to be primÂ and proper and not overly emotional. Â She may not be on the Iron Throne(yet ) but she is still ruling over cities, so her acting is what I expect I guess others(most of the people in this thread)Â didn't expect it and that's why they don't think she is good.
Â 
Season 1: 14-year oldÂ exiled Targaryen, living in her Brother's shadow
Season 4: A Queen with her own army and Dragons
of courseÂ the way she actsÂ is changing because her character is

4205	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-09	I think it may be a combination of not great writing for the character. Her scenes getting cut. We don't know how much of her scenes get left on the cutting room floor. And the character being aged up. I think Book Dany starts at 13 or just 13 and show Dany starts at 15 turning 16. Perhaps the fact that the character is older attributes to some of the changes from the book i.e. less self doubt more confidence.
Â 
But my point in my last post was that I don't think it's true to blame it on her having a background mainly on stage.

4207	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-05-09	I actually don't think she's that bad, people are just expecting one thing from her while she gives somethingÂ different...Â

Yeah I think the Tower of the Hand review sums it up quite well.
Â 
"Speaking of things nobody cares about, Daenerys has a council meeting in Meereen this week. A council meeting? Really? In a brand new council chamber? My excitement, truly, cannot be contained (although, sarcasm aside, the new set, presumably the interior of the Great Pyramid, actually looks really good). The scene was wonderfully entertaining, if you're one of the legions of people who can, apparently, only be entertained when they're bitching about Emilia Clarke. Seriously, folks, there's not much you can do when Jorah Mormont is projectile-vomiting exposition in every direction and your solitary scene is completely devoted to the process of deciding not to do anything. If the Meereen storyline stays true to the books, Clarke is in for a rough year. Here's hoping Xaro Xhoan Daxos manages to scratch his way out of that vault."

I wonder if that was written after reading this thread
4209	cmm426	2014-05-09	I wonder if she intentionally seems a bit wooden? I imagine that might very well be how a insecure young girl acts who has been saddled with the responsibilty for thousands of Unsullied and tens of thousnds of freed slaves and who is desperately trying to seem regal and self assured all the time.


Â 
I agree, seems intentional.Â  Its almost likeÂ she is holding everything in, trying to be a "Queen," and hiding her emotions.Â  It is like she is constantly trying to figure out what to do.Â

They are pissing on slaves, to show how little they fear us ... They would never dare such a thing if it were a Dothraki khalasar outside their gates.

I understand it's difficult to portray Dany on screen considering that she's so introverted, but the writers sometimes make it look like she's not even thinking at all.

It's a fair point that Emilia's material isn't great, but the sequence with the hero's willy is a good example of her being asked to do very little (play the "feed") and still managing to come up short. Â Failing at playing the "straight man" is a pretty poor argument for deserving the part of the "comic".
Â 
I honestly wonder if the fuss made over Sean Bean in Season 1 hasn't adversely affected some of the younger actors on the show. Â After hearing so much about emoting coming from "behind the eyes" I feel like Emilia (in particular) is trying (and failing miserably) to emulate a more minimalist approach. Â There was a period where Maisie had a similar affliction but she seems to have found her way out of it.
Â 
It's a fine line between brilliance and failure, and unfortunately Emilia has been on the wrong side of it almost exclusively since those eggs hatched.Â

If and when she nails later material I'll be happy.

Â 
I honestly don't see the slightest difference between her performance in Season 3 versus 4. Â If all she can do is "wooden, emotionless b*tch" and it's up to the writers to make that 100% of her scenes, I don't see how she can be considered anything less than a abject failure as an actress.
4216	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-09	But she was so completely different in season 1, she was unsure of herself, frightened, wistful etc. She's not a 'failure' as an actress, but she and the writers/directors do need to come up with some material to illicit a much different response from her soon otherwise she's in danger of appearing stale.
4217	Mark Antony	2014-05-09	She can do more than "wooden emotionless bitch"

Exactly. And it happens too damn often in this show, with all the characters. For half the time, I couldn't really tell what is going through the heads of those characters I'm watching, if anything goes at all. An example from another thread, about Craster's: what can possibly go through Locke's head while he's making his "plan" to capture Bran? How is anyone to play that part with any believability and credibility? I mean, possibly the most important part of acting is to get into the head of a character you're playing. But seriously, how is anyone to go into the head of TV Locke in last episode?! Now, Emilia can't be entirely excused like that, because she does have books (and the example you provided does show she can find a lot of help there), but, truth be told, her TV lines are so terrible, I wouldn't be surprised she gave up on trying to understand her part at all. Again, she doesn't fascinate me with her acting abilities, but she's far from the biggest slayer of TV Dany.

Â 
It's interesting that Emilia actually has read the books (and is a very big fan of them)... and that's actually evident sometimes, particularly in this episode in her reaction to the news of Yunkai and Astapor. Like book Dany, she's completely unsurprised; her reaction is actually perfect - it looks exactly like she's thinking of Eroeh and the Dothraki who followed her into the Red Waste and perished for it. The problem is that the script doesn't work with this. There's no Eroeh, for example, the perfect symbol of Dany's failure to protect the people she "saves". But that could be avoided by adding a line or two to explain why she's unsurprised. "It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going as planned" is just a terrible line, and there's absolutely no excuse for it when there is SO much to work with. They could have had Dany reference her failed attempt to save the Lamb women, the deaths in the Red Waste, or her failure to protect her people in Qarth.
Â 
To cut a long argument short: I think Emilia has a good understanding of Daenerys. The problem is that Benioff and Weiss just... don't. Or at least they don't know how to portray her correctly. I mean, before anyone jumps in and attacks me for that assertion, I have to say this: Weiss has been on record as saying that he thinks Dany didn't know what would happen in Drogo's pyre... Apparently her line "I am Daenerys Stormborn, daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons. Don't you see? Don't you SEE?" just wasn't explicit enough for him.

Â 
Didn't know this. It's very interesting. Practically, it means that the pyre scene in season one was saved by Emilia and Iain Glen: when he tried to persuade her not to enter the pyre, she did look like a woman who knows what she's doing, and after her response he did look like someone who recognized that. That's why the scene worked at the end, if you ask me. Well, at least now we can figure out whom the two of them didn't consult with about that scene.
4221	Seneti	2014-05-09	This isn't really the thread for this, but I actually liked this change, and I saw it as a positive for Margaery.

We clearly just read the scene in different ways (or I'm misunderstanding your point.)

We've gone off topic with Marg and Loris, regarding Renly.. but I'd like to add that I presumed brother and sister would BOTH be in there, with Loris getting things started and Marg finishing him off, with the overall intent of her getting pregnant.

They're all at it, all deviant.. so let's just sit back and enjoy the show 


Â 
Agreed. Margaery struck me as utterly pragmatic in that scene, which is in character for the Tyrell family. But different strokes for different folks, I guess. I don't want to derail the thread.
Â 


Â 
So we're suddenly supposed to accept mediocrity because 'it's her first shot' or something? That's no excuse. For the money she gets paid, and the very rare opportunity she has been given over many other young aspiring actresses, one would assume she would be great for the role. Â

Â 
Speaking of D&D's range, and before show-apologists storm here attacking you or me: is there any major character D&D managed to translate from book to screen in a way that undoubtedly means they actually understood that character? At the moment, I can't think of any, truth be told, besides Davos who, while a brilliantly designed character, is brilliant precisely because he's simple and easy to understand - though, that dynamics may change with his ADWD material, and, considering his TV tolerance toward actions against The Seven, it's not D&D didn't try to misunderstand him, too.

"Hey, you know that thing I've implicitly promised with my final scene every season?Â  Yeah, not happening.Â  Put on some sunglasses and DEAL WITH IT."
Â 
Rather anticipating how the show-only crowd is going to react to that as they pick up on the implications of her Just Saying No to her long-assumed plot arc.
4236	P. frontalis chiripepe	2014-05-05	Right?
Â 
It's like they were trying to make the TV viewers even more frustrated.

Â I agree, but at the same time she is very wise for not wanting subordinates who go on dangerous missions without her knowledge or consent. That type of thing can bite you in the ass as often as it will benefit you.
Â Â  Another good line was Margaery asking if she should call Cersei 'sister....or mother?'......

This. The Hound and Arya dialogues are always good for a laugh.

Â 
Arya is not as good as she thinks she is, not yet anyway ... and I loveÂ it every time someone reminds her of that fact (like when Thoros disarmed her like it was nothing.)
Â 
Also ... finishing her prayer after you think she's done with "The Hound" was a nice touch.
Â 
And every single line Lysa Arryn had. That woman is cray cray gold.

4244	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-05	"Everywhere in the world they hurt little girls."
Â 
Loved it. For a season that hasn't shied away from sexual violence and cruelty, this quote (and another from one of Craster's wives) acknowledges just how aware these characters are of the treatment of woman in that world.
Â 
Though my favourite probably is:
Â 
"I missed you, boy."

Yeah, this Arya / Hound stuff is pretty good. Mind you, nothing jumps right out there as a wicked line. (Unless you count her being belted in the head for trying to stick him with the pointy end.)
Â 
Â 


Â 
When Marg called her mother it looked like Cersei vomited in her mouth a bit. Loved it.


Â 
Â 
Cersei was being uncharacteristically reasonable with Margaery this time around - she's clearly up to something.
Â 
Â 


"Everywhere in the world they hurt little girls."


Â 
This was pretty good too. Calling Oberyn out on his bullshit, a little bit.Â

4250	ToTheWolves	2014-05-05	Also did anyone think that whole debate about  syrio being alive or dead  between arya in the hound was a nod to readers??  Or something like that?
4251	Zoe_H	2014-05-05	Pod regaining some lost aplomb during the "Combat Experience?" segment of his job interview:

4252	Velociraptor	2014-05-05	Just about anything that came out from the Hound's mouth. Man, everytime I think I couldn't love the character any more, he delivers something that one ups his previous lines.
Â 
"THE GREATEST SWORDSMAN EVER LIVED DIDN'T HAVE A SWORD?! :D" And that laugh at the end. Had to replay the scene just to hear it again.
4253	Meemaw	2014-05-05	Also did anyone think that whole debate about syrio being alive or dead between arya in the hound was a nod to readers?? Or something like that?

Why? Â Because show watchers are too stupid to consider that he may still be alive? Â We book readers are the only ones who possess the requisite intelligence to make such a fairly straightforward guess?

Yeah! :'''D
4282	Faceless Man Friday	2014-05-05	While not lines per se, Maise Williams does an excellent job conveying Arya's thoughts through body language and facial expressions. Â So my favorite line was her initial reaction when Needle did not pierce the Hound's armor, before she got slapped by the Hound.Â
4283	iknownothingjonsnow	2014-05-05	What is Syrio other than a bag of words and fan fiction?
Â 
Hound was right.


Â 
My point is, Syrio is a fan favorite in both the books and show, and any potential developments involving his character wouldn't be a 'nod to book readers'. Â If anything, there is more evidence in the show that he may have survived his encounter with Trant (the last thing we hear is the sound of metal hitting the ground followed by screams from multiple sources). Â I don't know whether the awesomeness of bothÂ Miltos Yeromelou and Tom Wlaschiha caused show watchers to speculate whether Jaqen is Syrio, but there's nothing more in the books to support that speculation than in the show.
Â 
I guess I'm just a little sensitive to this idea of 'nods to the book readers' because (1) they usually constitute absolutely nothing at all and (2) they usually imply that the book readers are fundamentally superior to the show watchers.
Â 
Sorry for getting OT...
Â 
Â 


I like that they had Dany at the beginning to get her out of the way. Â I hate it when you look the clock and realize that it's 45 minutes past the hour and you just know they're going to close out with Emilia making some boring diatribe with that stupid smug look on her face... - 'iknownothingjonsnow'
 


 
Â 
Â 
EDT: Back on topic, Lysa and Robin Arryn (both of whom I hate in the books) were quite wonderful.
Â

Â  As an aside, I do like subtle comic relief in shows like this, but I felt they were laying it on a bit thick with the Brienne/Pod routine. Too much comedy can appear misplaced in this genre. I liked this pair in the books better, and the way they met in the books flowed more naturally.
Â

Small Unit Tactics by The Hound:

c (chickens) = number of chickens in a room
t (trants) = number of Meryn Trants the people with chickens in a room could beat

4314	Talking Hodor	2014-05-08	Â

And just when Daario finally got her that ever-elusive fleet, too...


Yeah, and where does she get off becoming so angry at him for that?! She's behaving like a pre-teen who expresses like for a boy via cruelty.Â  What else are they going to do with the Mereenese navy, let it go its merry slaving way?Â  Of course they're going to capture it!
4315	Talking Hodor	2014-05-08	"Hodor" as hodored by Hodor while being warged by Bran, shortly before killing Locke.

Â Â  Yeah.
4320	Pod The Impaler	2014-05-08	This is not a line, but I have to add, when Cersei intrudes on that nice look between Mergaery and Tommen.Â 
Or as someone else described it:
Â 
Margaery, heeding the wise words of her grandmother, smiles back brilliantly and eye-fucâ<U+0080>¦ erâ<U+0080>¦â<U+0080><U+009D>snuggles him with her eyesâ<U+0080><U+009D> until an imposing looking Cersei steps directly between them to literally C-block the action. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s all very ominous, especially when she slowly approaches Margaery like a lioness stalking a tender gazelle.

Â

4321	Le Cygne	2014-05-08	I didn't think Dany was angry at Daario at all. Look at her little smile as she turns away.

4323	Le Cygne	2014-05-09	I think they are going for sexual tension. He didn't seem bothered by it at all.I agree it could have been done better, but so could a lot of the things they changed on the show.
4324	Lord Spark of House Spark	2014-05-03	The episode titles usually refer to more than one thing.
King Tommen first of his name is the obvious one, the only others I could think of are maybe Jon Snow as LC, or possibly Hizdar as king of Meereen.

Its not long after she marries him that she goes to the fighting pit.Â

I think we will see his first proposal this season and maybe the start of the Harpy; but this is largely just to ease the transition into season 5 which has a lot to get done character wise.Â

Â 
Â 
Im fairly sure the season is going to end with NW Stannis vs ManceÂ Â  in the NW plot.Â 
Â 
The whole reason there doing this Jon saves Bran mission is because Jon showed up back at the wall to early last season. And there stalling.Â Â  Its just bad writing.

4334	HTN02	2014-05-04	Stannis need to go do something. he has to be at at the wall in episode 09, and he has a stopover in braavos before that... he need to be gone from dragonstone by this episode i think.

4343	Hoo	2014-05-05	Aleyne Stone is the first of Belish of Harrenhal name?
4344	Aerys Blackfyre	2014-05-08	I appreciated that during the coronation they simply called him Tommen of the House Baratheon,Â first of his name
what the hell is a "Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon"?
4345	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-08	Never understood that much, myself.
4346	'96Buck	2014-05-08	I appreciated that during the coronation they simply called him Tommen of the House Baratheon,Â first of his name
what the hell is a "Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon"?


An interesting choice there...using both is equally correct/incorrect for Tommen as for Joffrey, so one of them is a breach of protocol.Â  And a pretty serious one, given the subject and setting.Â  Obviously the norm would be that Cersei would abandon Lannister and take Baretheon, but she hasn't really done that.Â  Recall that Prince Joff had quartered his arms Baretheon and Lannister...that is obviously Cersei's doing or influence.Â 
Â 
It seems likely that Joffrey, "hungry for honors," added "and Lannister" over the objections of the protocol people and Cersei didn't stop it.Â  If Tywin even knew, he didn't stop it either, he's hungry for Lannister honor, too.Â  The wedding choices certainly played up House Lannister, though much of that was probably Cersei.
4347	TheKitttenGuard	2014-05-08	I appreciated that during the coronation they simply called him Tommen of the House Baratheon,Â first of his name
what the hell is a "Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon"?

My take is Lannister-Baratheon was a apex of power and arrogance proclaimation.
Now that their position is weaker they need to go back to the claim that Baratheon gives them.
4348	King Cheops	2014-05-08	The whole "Joffrey is born of Jaime and Cersei's incest" thing hadn't had time to make the rounds by that point either. Â Better to drop the Lannister part from Tommen's titles so as not to remind people...
4349	lostinwesteros	2014-05-08	My understanding is that only kings/queens are given titles which include "First of His/Her Name."Just parenthetically, other episodes, too, have been titled in reference to a specific event/character; however they have, as do all episodes, consist of multiple events/characters of focus, e.g., "Mhysa".
4350	shiola	2014-05-04	What did you love about this episode? Â From the smallest background detail to an obvious character moment, everything is fair game! Â This is a hate-free zone to shamelessly gush over everything you love about the series.Â Â NO PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE NEGATIVITY OR BACKHANDED COMPLIMENTS.
Â 
And, for the love of the Mother, remember..
Â 
NO SPOILERS MEANS NO SPOILERS
- no hinting
- no predictions
- no vague statementsÂ 
(UNLESS IT IS UNDER A SPOILER TAG)
Â 
This is an oasis of love and fangirling/fanboying/fanpersoning.
4351	shiola	2014-05-04	I'm gonna kickstart this bad boy off by saying THOMAS BRODIE-SANGSTER'S ACTING.
Â 
I was just crazy for him this week. Â When he was telling Karl how he saw him die, his voice got so low and dark. Â His eyes were lethal and he was justÂ so pissed off.Â 
	Spoiler  And on the complete flipside, he has also been showing that he is getting weaker and sicker without it being spelled out for us.
 Â AND, finally, the far-away sort of quality to his voice and expression when he's greenseeing (is that a real term?). Â The Sight is some heavy shit for a young man to deal with, and I think he shows the weight of it very, very plainly and honestly.
Â 
On that same train of thought, him seeing his hand burning and answering, "You'll know" was cool and ominous and creepy as fuck. Â The dark tone to Bran & Co's storyline is one of my favorite things of the show at the moment.

The show's ability to make me laugh out loud in between scenes that are so tense I want to throw up is just magical and wonderful. Â The poor boy stomping on the rabbit! Â I have such a soft spot for these two. Â Their scenes are so cute.
4354	Newstar	2014-05-04	Sweetrobin cheerfully tossing Petyr's gift out the Moon Door was so perfect. I can't even...that was amazing.

We know Jojen is sick and we know he saw his death without it being told straight away by the show ! And he delivered his speech to Karl perfectly !

I loved the Craster's Keep scene. Â You know why? Â People that haven't read the books ACTUALLY LIKE JON NOW. Â It worked!
4358	shiola	2014-05-04	Sweetrobin cheerfully tossing Petyr's gift out the Moon Door was so perfect. I can't even...that was amazing.

4362	Krutoon	2014-05-04	I thought Oberyn and Cersei's conversation in the garden was delightful. It was some good characterization for both of them.
4363	Newstar	2014-05-04	Â 
There are some small moments or short lines thatÂ completelyÂ summarize the characters without being glaringly obvious or heavy-handed and I think this was definitely one of them. Â It was awesome.Â 


Â 
Yes! Exactly. I can't even articulate how elegantly that little moment captured Sweetrobin's character. That's pretty much all you need to know right there.
4364	Florina Laufeyson	2014-05-04	Tommen making cute googly eyes at Marg. "Yer my BEST friend! My best friend!"Â 
Â 
Sand Snakes got mentioned! Woop! Oberyn being more than a lovable sex maniac.
Â 
Eyrie. All of it. I missed Lysa's nuttiness. Robin tossing the glass birdy out the Moon Door in order to show off for Sansa. Lysa trying to eat Littlefinger...oh man. Lysa making noises made me fucking roar. Sansa's all "omg...really?Â Really?" I liked how she didnt look prudish about it, just annoyed.Â 
Sansa's expression when Lysa drops the bomb about her marrying Sweetrobin. It was like "You are fucking kidding me..."
Â 
Dany's expression when she realizes she done fucked up. Nice to see her in a change of clothes too.
Â 
Arya's list.Â 
Â 
Pod the Bunny Cooker. I think im going to enjoy the Pod/Brienne scenes a lot.Â 
Â 
Jon being a badass. Good gods he looks great in that black without the cape.Â  

Jojen being awesome.Â In your face, Jojenpaste!!! And Hodor Smash! I loved how Locke got Hodor'd.Â 
Â 
Karl being really dangerous.Â 
Â 
The girls of Craster's Keep fighting back.Â 
Â 
Longclaw through Karl's dome and Ghost finally getting to gnaw on someone's dome. Rast had it coming. He was mean to Ghost.Â
4365	Merysa Serrett	2014-05-04	Pod and Brienne - my favorite new pairing. Very much looking forward to more of them. Hopefully Pod learns to control that horse.
Â 
Hodor hodoring it up. I cheered. So happy that Hodor finally got to do something other than push Bran around in his cart.Â 
Â 
Jon is a boss. He is bringing it this season. His showdown with Karl was satisfying. So happy to see Jon and Ghost back together again.Â 
Â 
Arya's water dancing. That was lovely to watch. And the Hound just made it better. Plus, Syrio mention - made me hopeful that maybe the First Sword of Braavos made it out alive after all.Â 
Â 
Lysa, Lysa, Lysa. One second she's a loving wife, mother, and aunt, and the next second she's Satan. Just fabulous. 
	Spoiler I hope they show more Lysa craziness before she goes flying.

4367	Salad Days Saan	2014-05-04	Locke gave a completely plausible cover story (or at least, one that the NW rangers could find plausible) to lead Jon away from where Bran was being kept.Â  And Bran chose his own path, away from Jon.Â  Reunion Avoided without making it look like either party was a moron for doing so/too much contrivance.
Â 
Hodor's staring at his hands and terrified whimpering after Bran left and he realized that he had killed Locke was great, too.Â  And his hesitation/initial refusal to follow Bran's orders after that.Â  Really effective emoting by Nairn, speaking to the audience without true dialogue (as must be the case with Hodor).

Â 
Yes.Â  You get the impression just about ANYTHING can set her off.Â  Good thing Sansa's got plenty experience in walking on eggshells and not saying the wrong thing, cuz that's apparently still an Important Survival Skill where she's living.Â  The swing from "I AM GOING TO BREAK YOUR FUCKING HANDS" to gently cradling Sansa's head was wonderfully quick.
Â 
Also on the Sansa front:Â  Sophie's exasperated "are you fucking serious with this shit?" look when she's unable to sleep because of Auntie's O-Voice.Â  This was a particular scene I was really looking forward to, and once again the show has absolutely delivered on one of my Most Anticipated Scenes.Â  Bravo.
4371	Oberyn2cool4Westeros	2014-05-05	I dug Jojen's little speech about how they're all gonna die and burn in righteous fire. Also thought his nod and Bran using it as a signal to warg-out was pretty awesome.

Hue! I was shocked that they even included that. When i realized what was going on, i just died laughing. My mother was all "umm..." cuz mental image of Littlefinger and Lysa naked is just..looool.Â Ill be honest, i was a wee bit nervous that HBO would show full on Lysa/LF action. So glad they didnt. Im loving how Sweetrobin is already trying to show off for Sansa. A nice clue!

It's like we're attached at the hip tonight! I don't even have to comment. You've pretty much summed up everything I think/feel tonight (in every thread).
Â 
Also...the kid who plays Jojen. WOW! Knocked it out of the PARK tonight! I was BEYOND impressed. 
And Jon killing Karl....my brother and I were Â  about that one. "Epic" only scratches the surface of what THAT was.

Â 
Oh my god, I hadn't even noticed that! That is brilliant!
Â 


Just didn't understand this resigned Cersei. Accepting Margery and Tommen's wedding, and hers with Loras? There must be something up...


Â 
I still stand by the believe that half the things Cersei says on the show (including her story about her baby with Robert) are lies she tells in order to manipulate people.
Â 
As for this episode, I really loved:
Â 
- Cersei unsuccessfully goating Margaery into ditching the demure, mourning widow disguise
- Missandei and Greyworm
- Daario being Daario (and getting chewed out for it)
- all the truth about Astapor and Yunkai being included, showing how flawed Dany's approach is so far
- Petyr lampshading the hairshade and his introduction of Alayne. At first I thought introducing her as his niece was stupid, but now that he has married Lysa, it's as actually closer to the truth (technically, Sansa is his niece now) and the closer a lie is to the truth, the harder it is to spot
- Katie being a wonderful Lysa - she was born to play this role
- Lysa's look when Robin said "they killed my father, too"
- Petyr's face when he sees the septon and Lysa's screaming (actually helped me cheer up my crying roommate, so double win here)
- the reveal that the Lannisters are out of gold made me go whoaaa
- Sandor's entire convo with Arya in which he once more robbed her of any and all unrealistic approaches to the world
- Walder Frey is in Arya's prayerÂ  Â 
- how quickly the convo between Lysa and Sansa changed from nice to hostile and back to nice
- Pod doesn't know how to handle his horse... I'm not even gonna go there
- The hound teaching Arya, though I guess Syrio really did die after allÂ  Â 
- Convo between Oberyn and Cersei - does this mean that all the sand snakes are in?
- Brienne's look of desperation at seeing the burning rabbit was priceless
- "help me with these straps" - dawww
- Jojen's burning hand - death by fire?
- Locke steering Jon away from Bran with a very good excuse
- I love to hate Karl
- Bran warging Hodor and poor Hodor's reaction after he kills Locke
- one of Craster's wives stabbing Karl
- Rast becoming Ghost chow
- Ghost's reunion with JonÂ hit me right in the feels
- the burning of the keep
4379	Lady Lurksalot	2014-05-05	Loved Jojen this time around!  Thomas Brodie-Sangster was amazing in his delivery tonight.  I also thought it was great seeing Hodor do something other than push a cart or carry Bran, and Kristian Nairn (sp?) did exceptionally well getting Hodor's horror and reluctance across without any dialogue.
4380	Duron Qel-Droma	2014-05-05	Some time ago, someone on the forums joked about the preview of Sansa lying in her chamber sleepless means she hears her aunt and Petyr making love. I laughed so hard as this turned out to be true!
Â 
I most liked the skirmish at Crasters on this episode. All there got, what they deserved. Anyone think, THAT scene was Jon driving his sword through Karls mouth?

And last: At the crowining ceremony there was a old man wearing a Lannister armor in the crowd and he later was shown again speaking with Mace Tyrell. Someone else thinks, this was indeed Kevan Lannister? I would love to see him back in action after they had most of his storyline cut.
4381	Cyril	2014-05-05	Everything with Lysa.Â  Everything. She's so perfect.Â  It blew me away.Â  The entire Eyrie section, really.
Â 
Sweetrobin being Sweetrobin.Â  He's so obnoxious, I love it.
Â 
Petyr's face when dealing with Lysa saying "let's get married now" and seeing her bring in the Septon.
Â 
Sword through the mouth was wonderfully brutal.
Â 
Meryn fucking Trant.
Â 
I ended up liking the episode more than I thought.Â
4382	Bilbo Baggins	2014-05-05	Cersei really stole the show this episode, all her scenes were great. Yet again proving that she isn't just a villainous, heartless bitch. Just 99% a villainous, heartless bitch.
4383	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-05	Jon and Karl's fight, easily my favourite of the series thus far. Loved that one of Craster's wives stabbed him in the back as justiceÂ 
Longclaw through Karl's head mirroring Pod's description of his first kill (seriously, how brutally awesome was that death?).
Pod and Brienne. I was sad to see the end of Jaime and Brienne's interactions for now, but this is shaping up to be just as good. Adorable and charming.
Cersei's trying to manipulate all three judges.
... And the veiled bitch-fight between her and Marg.
King Tommen! Long may he reign!
The Sandsnakes exist!
Talk of Myrcella, and Cersei's worry for her.
Jojen's greendreams. Loved it.
4384	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	I knew there would be SOME of Oberyn's daughters, but im surprised they adapted all 8 to the screen.
Â 
I was grinning like mad when Tywin told Cersei about basically being broke.
Â 
Lysa was responsible for Jon Arryn's death, just like the books.

My second fave scene was Arya poking Sandor in the chest with Needle. I couldn't help but laugh at his expression, then hers.Â  Until he hit her, of course.Â  Then I was very  .

He is so adorable goofy. "Son, daughter! Look what I did! Isn't this awesome? It's totally awesome, right?"

All the while Loras has his "plz kill me now" face on (he was also the last one to applaud after Tommen being proclaimed) and Marg is busy holding eyecontact with Tommen.

The second was a very deep scene for me. For multiple reasons.
Â 
Sandor points out how unskilled Arya truly is. THe Braavosi way of fighting may all be well, but a war is different from say a duel. Also you have to be pragmatic (the armour).
Â 
Then him slapping her is a wake-up call, the world is harsh and does not give a fuck if she is a girl or of nobility, harsher men then Sandor exist and they will kill her (matter of fact almost every other soldier in Westeros would have killed her after she tried to poke Sandor).

4390	roxWolfox	2014-05-05	The second was a very deep scene for me. For multiple reasons.
Â 
Sandor points out how unskilled Arya truly is. THe Braavosi way of fighting may all be well, but a war is different from say a duel. Also you have to be pragmatic (the armour).

Oh, I understood the scene alright.Â  It's just the sight of a huge man like the Hound slapping a little girl.Â  Just wakes up the mama tiger in me, is all.Â Â  If nothing else, it underlined why his name is on Arya's 'list'.Â Â
4391	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	Oh, I understood the scene alright.Â  It's just the sight of a huge man like the Hound slapping a little girl.Â  Just wakes up the mama tiger in me, is all.Â Â  If nothing else, it underlined why his name is on Arya's 'list'.Â Â  


I understand. Hurting kids and women doesn't sit well with me either. Which is why I wish a most vicious death on Janos Slynt for how he led the slaughter of those babies.
4392	binga	2014-05-05	Good performances by supporting cast saved the episode for me. In particular the actors for Lysa and Jojen were fantastic.
4393	Bleiz	2014-05-05	Did anyone else love that we got a Brandon Stark reference!
4394	Mark Antony	2014-05-05	Lena Headey  love her
4395	igrewupinKL	2014-05-05	Oberyn's weird look seeing cersei share a tender moment by herself about myrcella
Â 
Jojen's visions
Â 
Hodor's first kill
Â 
Jon + Ghost reunion
Â 
Lysa's scenes. she is perfect crazy
4396	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-05	I really liked seeing Jon from Bran's point of view, knowing full that that's probably the last time he'll see him or any of his family in person.
4397	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-05	I really liked seeing Jon from Bran's point of view, knowing full that that's probably the last time he'll see him or any of his family in person.


Â 
So did I. Seeing Bran actually crawl towards Jon and yell out his name was quite sad (I actually thought Jon heard him for a second, but unfortunately not).

4399	BillBones	2014-05-05	my dude jon snow sticking karl with longclaw right in the mouth and reuniting with ghost


Â 
This!!!
Â 
Found myself laughing hysterically when it happened. Now feeling like a psychopath.
4400	ToTheWolves	2014-05-05	"Seven hells!...I missed you boy!" Jon to ghost
4401	lostinasia	2014-05-05	I'm not sure what else I can add ... some good lists here.
Parallel between the Hound and Karl mocking a Stark for fancy impractical fighting.
That one of Craster's wives knifed Karl - perfect! I think that was the only scene that got an audible cheer from me. And the women making their own way is cool, as absurd as it probably is.
Locke looking badass again as a scout.
Pod being Pod with the rabbit and the horse. And then how wonderfully he refused to show any pride in killing a Kingsguard, and Brienne's unspoken reaction.
Being surprised that both Karl and Locke died this episode. I really thought Locke would linger on as a threat to Bran for a while.
The perfect, perfect look of horror on Hodor's face as he tried to figure out what his body had done.
Imagining one of the Blood Gate (?) men with arrows pulled back accidentally letting loose and putting an untimely end to all of Littlefinger's plans.
Tommen's look of nervousness - I have no idea how the old kid would have worked out, but thus far the new one is doing great.
The "WTF?!" moment when Cersei talks to Margaery. And ditto when she talked to Oberyn. I'm not entirely sure where they're going with her, but I like being mystified.
Daario looking cocky again.
Jojen's gaze at his burning hand.
Sansa obviously thinking that Tyrion isn't THAT bad, but she knows this is neither the time nor the place to say so.
Oberyn writing a poem to his daughters, and Cersei remarking that he's one of the most feared warriors in the Seven Kingdoms. I'm glad they're bringing forward his Renaissance Man qualities.
"Wow Arya - you really are becoming a bit psycho, aren't you?"
4402	Wsaharan	2014-05-05	Jon making Karl shut up in the most effective way possible.
Â 
Nice to be back in The Vale, I love Kate Dickie's portrayal of Loonie Tully. Oh god the screams. It killed me.
Cercei's more subtle intriguing and her genuine longing for her daughter.
4403	Wsaharan	2014-05-05	Did anyone else love that we got a Brandon Stark reference! 


Â 
Oh yes!!!
4404	Brother Walfrid	2014-05-05	I'm glad they emphasised Hodor's utter revulsion at having his mind violated and forced to go against his non-violent nature.
Â 
It's not cool to do that, people.
4405	MyLittleFinger	2014-05-05	Lysa turning up the acting was nice, she and Petyr were good...Sansa didn't do it for me this episode, but Lysa carried it, man she was great.
Â 
Sweet...crazy...sweet...crazy....super crazy...nah I'm sweet don't worry...but if you mess with me!Â 
Â 
I loved the "Hey bitch stop telling my secrets, here kiss me!" moment. Exactly what I pictured.Â 
Â 
Loved Jojen being given some lines, he nailed it, loved the foreshadowing and finally a use for his greensight.Â 
Â 
Hodor the gentle giants look of horror at what he was forced to do was so subtle, but so good. It speaks to what he really is and how if he did have "a brain" as it were, nobody could stand against him kind of deal, but it's his simplicity and sweetness that make him who he is.Â 
Â 
Â 
Â
4406	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-05	I had one particular bit that made me laugh. Tyin/Cersei scene
Â 
goes something like this
Â 
Cersei: we'll have to wait the appropriate mourning time for Tommen to mourn his brother and Marg to mourn her husband
Â 
Tywin: A fortnight?
Â 
Cersei: That seems reasonable
Â 
That had some awesome comic timing in what was a fairly tense and serious scene. SHowing just how mercenary and cold they are. It was just perfect delivery.
4407	Korgan	2014-05-05	Arya finishing her list after Sandor let her say: "Just one more name: THE HOUND.". Love it!
4408	Chebyshov	2014-05-05	I loved just about all of it, but Cersei the Judicial Manipulator was definitely top of my list.
Â 
Pod makes me want to hug him and feed him soup.
Â 
Oh and Lysa was just perfect.
4409	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-05	Â 
- Lysa wasn't psycho enough
Â 


Â 
Â Really? i have no idea how she could be more psycho.Â
4410	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-05-05	was just thinking during the lysa/sansa scene "lysa doesnt really seem that cra-- oh, there it is" she was great
4411	starklinson	2014-05-05	The Eyrie completely stole the episode it was done just perfectly.
4412	rmholt	2014-05-05	Arya's water dancing. I imagine that represented a lot of work.
4413	Janicia	2014-05-05	I really liked that Hodor's sense of violation and repulsion was shown and that Bran completely ignored it. Â Bran also had no hesitation about killing a person - isn't this his first murder? Â Definitely self defense, but murdering somebody would have really shaken the Bran from a few years ago. Â And Arya telling Sandor that she still wanted to kill him when he's sticking his neck out protecting her over and over. Â If Sandor was acting selfishly, he'd have turned Arya over to the Lannisters and gone to join the mercenaries rather than trying to get Arya to the Vale. Â The way they're showing Bran and Arya get darker really works for me, and its also good to see Sansa come into her own. Â 
Â 
I also liked Cersei forcing herself to play nice with Margery, Tywin, and Oberyn. Â I wondered why Margery brought up the sister bond, since she knows that sets Cersei off, but it makes sense that she knew Cersei's almost friendliness was forced and Margery decided to lob a barb at Cersei. Â
4414	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-05	The Eyrie completely stole the episode it was done just perfectly.


Â 
Yup. They did it exceptionally well. The set, the storyline, the actors (Sophie, Kate and Aiden were all great!)
Â 
and Robin of course

Arya was just starting.  So it's more a statement of her vulnerabilities, not the fighting style per se.
We may see that armor can be a hindrance.

Â Bran also had no hesitation about killing a person - isn't this his first murder? Â Definitely self defense, but murdering somebody would have really shaken the Bran from a few years ago.


Â 
Yeah, this was a great scene and it showed for the first time that warging a person is something bad.
Â 
(I actually made a thread about it, but somehow no mod wants to give his ok for it...)
4417	OberynMartelll	2014-05-05	Tywin's line:
Â 
"He used to pat me on the back alot."
4418	rmholt	2014-05-05	I thought it was very weird that helicopter mom Lysa let Robin scamper about the Moon Door. I got vertigo just watching that.
4419	sj4iy	2014-05-05	I loved that, just once in the show, even if it never happens again...we got a moment to cheer for, something that we all wanted and was a small victory for the good guys. No, I wouldn't want to see it all of the time, but I think it breaks up the bleakness and keeps the show fun.
4420	Jairion Lannister	2014-05-05	Tywin's line:
Â 
"He used to pat me on the back alot."


 Â I was coming in here just to stay that. Tywin's tone when he says it is perfect, and it's such a Robert thing to do and an un-Tywin thing that you can see why he'd be annoyed by it. Great delivery.
4421	CrypticWeirwood	2014-05-05	Way cool that we finally learnt that Elia, Oberyn and Ellariaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s eldest daughter, really was named after his late sister. Â 
Â 
Even though it did blow apart the cute fan-theory that she was actually named after Ran. Â
4422	sj4iy	2014-05-05	Jon making Karl shut up in the most effective way possible.

That whole scene reminded me of a quote from "Men at Arms" by Terry Pratchett:â<U+0080><U+009C>Something Vimes had learned as a young guard drifted up from memory. If you have to look along the shaft of an arrow from the wrong end, if a man has you entirely at his mercy, then hope like hell that man is an evil man. Because the evil like power, power over people, and they want to see you in fear. They want you to know you're going to die. So they'll talk. They'll gloat.
They'll watch you squirm. They'll put off the moment of murder like another man will put off a good cigar.
So hope like hell your captor is an evil man. A good man will kill you with hardly a word.â<U+0080><U+009D>
4423	Gail	2014-05-05	Everything LysaÂ
4424	greywindsrage	2014-05-05	I'm gonna kickstart this bad boy off by saying THOMAS BRODIE-SANGSTER'S ACTING.
Â 
I was just crazy for him this week. Â When he was telling Karl how he saw him die, his voice got so low and dark. Â His eyes were lethal and he was justÂ so pissed off.Â 
	Spoiler  And on the complete flipside, he has also been showing that he is getting weaker and sicker without it being spelled out for us.
 Â AND, finally, the far-away sort of quality to his voice and expression when he's greenseeing (is that a real term?). Â The Sight is some heavy shit for a young man to deal with, and I think he shows the weight of it very, very plainly and honestly.
Â 
On that same train of thought, him seeing his hand burning and answering, "You'll know" was cool and ominous and creepy as fuck. Â The dark tone to Bran & Co's storyline is one of my favorite things of the show at the moment.


Â
4425	Seneti	2014-05-05	For some strange reason, Craster's woman saying that they'd been beaten by Craster, beaten by the Black Brothers and they'd be fine in finding their own way.Â  Then she spits on the ground and tells them to burn the keep and the dead.Â  Just .... wow.Â  That was such a moving scene, for me.Â  I loved it.


Â 
Agreed. That scene was really powerful and I appreciate the fact that there was no arguing about it. Craster's Wives made their choice, assured Jon that that's what they really wanted. End of discussion. No "but what if..." or "but you'd be safer". It also meant that Jon has finally come to terms with the idea that, yes, his "Brothers" are a rag-tag bunch of misfits that consists in great part of thieves, rapists and murderers. No more illusions. Jon has come a long way from season 1.
4426	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-05	The Stark love-
Brandon Stark being mentioned
Bran shouting for Jon to come and save him showing the love and respect he has for him- he thought Jon could save him! That would have beenÂ my ideal reunion as well.... 
The parallels between Bran and Jon having to put their duty before their family/love with Bran deciding not to seek out Jon.
Arya adding Walder Frey to her kill list! She wants revenge against those who wronged her mother and brother...and he represents House Frey!
"Come here boy" 
Â 
Craster's wives/daughters saying f*ck off to everything with a dick.
Â 
Jojen being a badass rather than a passive background character!
Â 
Littlefinger and Sansa with their comedic annoyanceÂ at Lysa- The "Oh shit" look from LF at hisÂ rapidly approaching wedding and Sansa with her 'urgh...really?' expression while hearing her aunt scream.

					
					
							Edited by ~DarkHorse~, 05 May 2014 - 01:52 PM.
4427	Asshai by the Shadow	2014-05-05	My favorite moments:
Â 
1. Jon/Bran almost reunion. I got a little teary eyed.Â 
2. Jon/Ghost reunion
3. When Jojen tells Karl his fate and then the NW comes. Very good timing.
4.When Arya says the last name on her list 'THE HOUND'. That was an epic moment.
5. Lysa/Sansa/LF scenes. I love crazy Lysa
4428	gotgrrrl	2014-05-05	Best bits for me.Â 
Arya water dancing and Syrio being mentioned. Maisie's handling of Needle is awesome.Â 
Sweet Robin's return.Â  I was surprised they kept the original actor.Â  I think he nails the part.
Sansa's reaction to the idea that she's to marry Robin once Tyrion is executed.Â  Poor girl just doesn't have any luck in the marriage department.Â 
Craster's wife stabbing Karl (and essentially saving Jon) and then the lot of them going on their own way.Â  No way would I trust any men at that point.Â
4429	The Kinkslayer	2014-05-05	Sansa finally got more lemon cakes.
4430	The Kinkslayer	2014-05-05	The wrath of Hodor!!
4431	NightStark	2014-05-05	The guy who plays Grenn is pretty much exactly as I imagined him, the blow he hit the guy just as Jon emerged from the hut was monstrous haha
4432	Dragonstoned	2014-05-05	Liked the Margaery & Tommen interaction (the look). Â Think they would make a cute couple if they ever get that far.
4433	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-05	Mace bumbling around in the throne room.
The soldiers of the Vale look pimp.
Tywin not liking that Robert patted him on the back.
Myrcella mentioned.
Everything in King's Landing has a fortnight time limit break.
Meryn Trant mocking.
Almost everything that: Pod, Arya, the Hound and Hodor said.
4434	lostinwesteros	2014-05-05	Pod and the rabbit, then Brienne learning a newfound respect for Pod.  
The Hound hearing that Arya's "one more name" was his (and everything else in their scene, as always).
Watching LF struggle with revulsion as Lysa slobbered all over him.
Jon's reunion with Ghost!!!
Pretty happy that the Lannisters are broke.
4435	Bowen	2014-05-05	Wow after weeks of complaining I thought they got this one bang on,so many good scenes with the pay off at Crasters,cool stuff going on with Jojen with the flaming hand what's that about?
4436	rmholt	2014-05-05	Pod and the rabbit, then Brienne learning a newfound respect for Pod.  
The Hound hearing that Arya's "one more name" was his (and everything else in their scene, as always).
Pretty happy that the Lannisters are broke.

She's been actively trying to kill him so it couldn't have been a massive surprise. Still, zing!  Then a lesson in the morning on prayer vs reality.
4437	Skeksi	2014-05-05	Lots of little things to like in the episode:
Â 
- Karl being taken down by one of Craster's wives (let's face it, even if Jon hadn't finished him off, he'd have died from that wound sooner or later). I get that with Jon being a major character it sucks for his fans to see him getting knocked about and nearly killed by "Villain of the week" Karl, but given that Craster's daughters have spent the last however many months being beaten and raped by Karl and the gang, it was a hell of a lot more satisfying seeing her stick a knife in his back than it would have been to see Jon-the-all-conquering-hero cut down Karl for justice. Same for the daughters going their own way and burning the keep, rather than just going along with the Night's Watch.
Â 
- Jon reunites with Ghost- I actually thought this was quite sweet.
Â 
- Pretty much everything with Lysa, LF and Sansa. I liked LF's facial expressions when he and Lysa were alone, particularly the "I'll call on the Septon" *doors open to reveal Septon* moment. I liked Sansa and Lysa's scene where Lysa turns on a dime from indulgent aunt, feeding her niece lemon cakes and sharing stories about her mother's childhood, to jealous and irrational and violent, back to comforting again. The Jon Arryn reveal was a lot earlier, but I think that maybe this gives viewers time to digest it, given that it's quite a while since Jon Arryn's death was a plot point. Don't want it getting lost in all the drama that is sure to unfold later in the series. It might be one that pays off more on rewatch for the show only viewers, when they rewatch S1 with the knowledge of who was actually behind it all.
Â 
- Mentions of Myrcella and the Sand Snakes.
4438	ipsuel	2014-05-05	We're going to Dorne, we're going to Dorne!


Â 
This ^^ Â Aside from (or along with) the Jon/Ghost reunion, this made me happiest. Cannot wait for Dorne!Â
4439	Mad Monkey	2014-05-05	Lysa is perfect. She really nails how the book character vacillates between being kind and sympathetic to Sansa and hysterically jealous at the drop of a hat. The Catelyn backstory was a nice touch too.
Â 
It might be one that pays off more on rewatch for the show only viewers, when they rewatch S1 with the knowledge of who was actually behind it all.
Â 
Agreed. Lysa played her role perfectly in Tyrion's trial, seemingly genuinely enraged at him for a crime that she herself committed.
Â 
It was neat that they gave Oberyn Martell a scene where he wasn't buried under a mountain of writhing, naked bodies. I really like the actor and the portrayal and it's nice that the showrunners are letting him have some range.Â 
Â 
The Daenerys scene was good too. I liked Dany's argument that, if she just abandons her subjects whenever their problems become inconvenient for her, then how can she convince anyone else to ever bend the knee to her again? It's kind of my go-to response for whenever someone suggests that it would be easier if she just disappeared and left the Dothraki, Ghiscari, etc. to their doom after she began her Slaver's Bay campaign and it was nice to hear her voice it.Â
4440	Moon-Pale Maiden	2014-05-05	my dude jon snow sticking karl with longclaw right in the mouth and reuniting with ghost


Â 
I sat up and screamed in delight when that sword went through Karl's mouth. Â And can we all give an extra hand to the actor portraying Karl? Â He was so excellent, so villainous, so deliciously evil. Â And pretty darn good with those knives!
4441	shiola	2014-05-06	I am so happy that people seem to enjoy this thread so much, and I love all the contributions. Â My goal is to have everyone enjoy the show as much as possible! Â 
Â 
However, when I make this thread every week, I say no spoilers for a reason. Â I've had to go through and report a lot of comments in here. Â Please tag stuff from the books, guys; it's not fair to the few non-readers among us.
4442	oierem	2014-05-06	Lots of little things to like in the episode:

Same for the daughters going their own way and burning the keep, rather than just going along with the Night's Watch.


I agree. I really believed that Jon would kill him, so this was a surprise, but it works better. Jon will have another moment to shine in episode 9 (when I hope he does kill Styr).
4443	BlackTalon	2014-05-06	been mentioned once before, but I too loved how Littlefingers expression changed when he noticed that Lysa had had her septon waiting outside the door the whole time. She is totally nuts.
4444	Sun	2014-05-06	I loved Lena's performance in this episode.Â 
Â 
I loved Lysa's scene with Sansa. Both Kate Dickie and Sophie performed beautifully.Â 
Â 
Brienne is always a a pleasure.Â 
Â 
Burn Gorman is wonderful.
4445	Mr Fixit	2014-05-06	The Daenerys scene was good too. I liked Dany's argument that, if she just abandons her subjects whenever their problems become inconvenient for her, then how can she convince anyone else to ever bend the knee to her again? It's kind of my go-to response for whenever someone suggests that it would be easier if she just disappeared and left the Dothraki, Ghiscari, etc. to their doom after she began her Slaver's Bay campaign and it was nice to hear her voice it.


Â 
Yes, Dany scene was very good indeed. I feel that the show sometimes tends to skimp on worldbuilding, so it's very gratifying to hear about the recent developments in Astapor and Yunkai as well as Dany's inner circle offering their opinions on Westerosi state of affairs.
4446	House Lunny	2014-05-06	I loved Hodor breaking Locke's neck but what really made it was Hodor's reaction when Bran stopped Warging him. Thought it was heartbreaking.
Â 
Littlefinger's expression when the septon was waiting outside the door was priceless.
Â 
Sophie Turners performance was wonderful.
Â 
Jon & Ghosts reunion
Â 
The Karl/jon fight was epic

4447	Corvinus	2014-05-06	- The Hound talking about Meryn Trant
- Jon vs. Karl - Jon is good, but he has still plenty to learn until he becomes the best swordsman in Westeros
- Pod and Brienne - the burning rabbit especially
- Bran warging into Hodor
- Rast's end
- Lysa and Sansa with the lemoncakes
4448	Ice_and_Fire	2014-05-06	Loved all the Eyrie scenes, they were perfect!!!Â 
Seeing Oberyn away from a brothel, and getting some lovely subtlety to his dialogue (FINALLY!), and the mention of the Sand Snakes.Â 
And I was really impressed with Thomas' acting with the visions, very cool.
4449	Mother of Mini Dragons	2014-05-06	For me, even though it didn't add much to the story, I absolutely loved Pod and Brienne's scene. The actor who plays Pod gets better and better and he just makes me smile.
Â 
Jon Snow!Â  
Â 
Lena Headey - don't like Cersei but LOVE her acting and she and Pedro have amazing chemistry. I'm also really loving new Tommen, he's pretty darn good.
Â 
After re-watching the Eyrie stuff, I really loved almost all of it. There's some nitpicks, but those belong in a different thread. What I loved was Sophie's acting and AG's as well. I liked watching how Sansa goes from joy to terror to WTF by the end of her scenes with Lysa.Â 
Â 
Arya and the Hound - they are amazing in every scene they have with one another.
Â 
Also, I loved Bran warging Hodor and him Hodorizing Locke!

Â 
Including that "Cat was getting fat" story - a nice littleÂ the "nod" to book readers in since of course it is book Lysa is the chubby one
4451	Osric	2014-05-06	I love the little details extracted directly from the books in several scenes, like the lemons to make lemon pie and, more exciting for me, I think that in that very same scene where Sansa is talkin with Lysa and eating lemon pie they're drinking what I think is Arbor Gold.... That made me very happy

4455	Ingelheim	2014-05-07	Burn Gorman's acting was extraordinary again.
4456	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-07	I really love the little connections that the show makes between characters, that tie them together despite their distance. For instance, in this episode both Arya and Jon are taught a lesson about 'fighting fair'.Â
4457	HairGrowsBack	2014-05-07	- Everything at the Eyrie was amazing : Lysa deliciously bat-shit insane, Sansa subtly manipulating her, Petyr's faces and Sansa's reaction to that
Â 
- Cersei buttering up the judges.
Â 
- How everyone cheered for Tommen not being Joffrey basically.
Â 
- Arya and The Hound finally getting out of the comedy routine for some serious, relevant stuff (mostly)
Â 
- Brienne and Pod kind of replacing them I guess, but with some bonding as well.
Â 
- Stuff at Craster's was better than last week ; enjoyed the women standing up for themselves.
Â 
- Jon and Ghost reunion
Â 
- Everything Jojen : amazing acting here.
4458	Rapsie	2014-05-07	The way Sandor Clegane said Westeros. Completely right pronunciation of Wester Ross and in nearly the right accent.
4459	The Fenris Wolf	2014-05-07	I loved the knife play by Karl, especially him knocking the knives together while advancing on Jon. Â Very menacing and flashy, exactly like my imagination tells me a King's Landing assassin would have taught himself to fight.
Â 
For some reason the actress playing Brienne has really captivated me. Â I just love her scenes, all of them. Â She looks quite different than I had imagined her in the books, but the actress does a perfect job portraying the earnestness and fundamental goodness of Brienne. Â Awesome stuff.
Â 
I thought the vision we got of the Bloody Gate was fantastic. Â I can see how an army trying to take that would just throw their hands up in the air and say 'fuck it, let's go home'.
4460	Newstar	2014-05-07	One great moment with Kate Dickie (Lysa) among many great moments in this episode is the way that she gives Sansa that sweet, fake smile when she holds Sansa's face, and once she's hugging Sansa and her face is hidden from Sansa, she drops the smile immediately. Fabulous.
Â 
Also loved the plummy accent and great voice of the High Septon performing the coronation ceremony. "Long may he reign!" never sounded so good.

 Â
4463	Grail King	2014-05-07	I liked both scenes between Lysa and Sansa esp. the lemon cake one where Sansa put Hound/ Baleish and her words to Margery about liars and stupid girl to her aunt to get out of that torture.

My wife caught that quickly also.
4465	Adam_Up_Bxtch	2014-05-08	Jon stabbing Karl in the head was the most amazing kill I have ever seen in the show, Karl was also one of my favorite villains in the show as well, sucks to see him bite the dust already..
4466	Grail King	2014-05-08	Liked the Cersei, Margery head screwing.
Â 
Really, really liked Lysa Sansa and Petyr dance, Lysa all sweet to her own flesh and blood and as she hugs her the daggers are shown from Sansa's backside, and Sansa redoing the lines from speacking with Baleish and Margery to get herself out of a bad situation.
Â 
I thought I was the only one who picked up on the Jojen nod to Bran, liked it but really felt bad for Hodor; but they had to save themselves some how.
Â 
Rast, Karl and Locke ( though I wished Locke lasted a bit longer ) loved their deaths.
Â 
Arya's water dance was nice to see.
Â 
I chuckled over Pod, and Robin letting the little bird fly.
Â 
Danny stuff was ok, KL was far better
4467	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-05-06	Does anyone else think that Jojen saying rather than him having a vision of falling snow in any way also correlate to the previous Bran/Dany vision of Snow on the throne/throne room and another subtle hint r+l is true? Keep in mind that grrm stated in rolling stone that d+d did get Jon's mother correct and d+d are also given the info about the entire broad strokes of the story.
4468	Korgan	2014-05-06	I think that snow is a very common thing in Westeros mostly at north, so Jojen seeing falling snow don't meaning anything.
4469	evita mgfs	2014-05-06	Hmm.Â  I must keep reminding myself of the many ways Martin and D&D like to make good use of puns.
4470	ovis alba	2014-05-06	I don't know, I had to smile when he said that "snow" is going to cover his bones (or something like that), because with Jon on the way it just made a lot of sense 
And I actually also had to think of the Throne Room scene, although I'm not sure if it's indeed hinting something concerning Jon.
4471	Envie	2014-05-06	I think it was a Metaphor for Jon Snow killing him and was also meant literally that after Craster's keep was burned down, snow would cover his bones. It's both literal and metaphorical and is just a teaser to the audience because at that point in the scene we already know Jon and co. are on their way to kill Karl and co.
4472	Indigocell	2014-05-06	I immediately thought of Jon when he said that, I don't think that was unintentional.
4473	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-06	I think it was a Metaphor for Jon Snow killing him and was also meant literally that after Craster's keep was burned down, snow would cover his bones. It's both literal and metaphorical and is just a teaser to the audience because at that point in the scene we already know Jon and co. are on their way to kill Karl and co.Yep. Basically this. Don't see anything else to it.

Â 
totally agree

Me, three.
4476	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-05-07	Well it has been speculated that we will get Jon's parentage from Jojen, Bran, or Howland. Also in Mel's visions in adwd iirc she also sees snow when she asks to see AA. Personally, I think that they, D+D are playing a little with the readers and giving subtle hints to observant viewers. Of course it's both metaphorical and literal, that's what makes every vision I gave ambiguous, bc if they hit everyone over the head each time ( looking at you LF and QoT ), it would give away the surprise. Also I think it's their way of giving the hints that we get in the books but won't reveal until twow come out. I'm sure grrm knows he can't hold off on something like that till ados since the show will be down way before 20xx but I think D+D will give him that respect to reveal it himself.
4477	dbunting	2014-05-07	I would have to say that mentioning snow was absolutely intentional and a reference to Jon. The books and series are full of hints and prophecies so why ignore this so quickly?
4478	The Prince of Newcastle	2014-05-07	To me, it seemed like forshadowing of the imminent death he suffered.
4479	Envie	2014-05-07	I would have to say that mentioning snow was absolutely intentional and a reference to Jon. The books and series are full of hints and prophecies so why ignore this so quickly?


Â 
Because anything from here on out is going to be purely speculation. We've now entered territory that hasn't been written going forward for a lot of the character's future and the show may or may not be representing things accurately. They tend to add things that weren't in the books if you haven't noticed yet. So anything you glean from it (ie the scene with the baby / White Walker sacrifice) has to be speculated about pretty broadly because we have absolutely no idea whether or not the material they're creating is true to the books or simply great looking footage and dialogue the show writers created themselves. For a fact we already know the entire Craster's Keep Bran / Jon Snow story arc was entirely made up so anything within that story arc has to be taken with a very large bag of salt, not just a grain.
Â 
While I do agree the show writers enjoy putting hints into the show specifically for book readers, I would not get too hung up on 'prophecies' or read too deeply into something as vague as "falling snow" if I were you - you are likely setting yourself up for frustration, disappointment, or both. The show isn't as deep in prophecy territory as the books and we don't have new book material beyond ADWD yet. I'm keeping myself purposely skeptical and with a wait-and-see attitude about pretty much any / all scenes in the show which touch on territory we have zero book information to back up our theories.
4480	dbunting	2014-05-07	Yes. But to summarily dismiss it seems premature
4481	Envie	2014-05-07	Yes. But to summarily dismiss it seems premature


Â 
Speculating on things that weren't in the books (fabricated by the show writers) and the future that hasn't occurred in the books is also premature as well as frustrating unfortunately. I'm not trying to shut anyone down - speculate away if you like. Â 
Â 
My initial response to the OP was just a simple analysis where I thought the meaning of "falling snow" was both a metaphor for John Snow killing Karl and a literal translation of snow covering his bones after Craster's Keep was burned down. Both of those things were absolutely true and we have no way to fathom how else that could be taken as a prophecy at this point.Â 
Â 
What kind of prophecy given to a walking dead man (Karl) by Jojen would make any sense with that line from the show?Â 
Â 
My remark was only meant to point out we have nothing to go on from the books yet and the scene was fabricated so we also have no idea if the writers made it up or it's actually a reference to written material we don't have yet. Either way it's frustrating to speculate on.
4482	dbunting	2014-05-07	Agreed. ..These forums wouldn't exist if we couldn't speculate though
4483	Envie	2014-05-07	Agreed. ..These forums wouldn't exist if we couldn't speculate though


Â 
True, and there are a lot of great theories out there on various characters and what happens to them. I prefer to stick to the theories based on actual material from the books though. When one crops up that ties in 'hints' from the show that also correlates with material from the books, then speculating gets fun. Unfortunately this particular scene wasn't in the books so I don't enjoy speculating about it as much because I don't trust D&D one inch anymore. I love their work and they are very creative writers, but they are fabricating things that aren't happening in the books and I think it's setting up a lot of readers for disappointment when George doesn't write the same thing later.
Â 
Another reason I wish he'd hurry up and finish the book!Â
4484	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-05-07	Trust me, taking anything away from a fabricated scene and expecting it to happen in the books is far from what I'm doing. What I am in fact doing is, since I realize that tv is a different media, and there obviously has to be some changes, espeacially if making something subtly written becomes very obvious when shown, looking for things that the writers who are very aware of what happens even if only the broadest of strokes dropping clues that are slightly different but do however correspond to things within the books. Perfect example, the toj scene, if they showed Lyanna dying in Ned's arms, and she bears a very striking resemblance to Jon, where's the surprise to the audience? None, but when you read the books, you have to visualize yourself what she may or may not look like.

haha true! I know this should make me feel better - but it doesn't ... just read it on a Mashable article called "7 Authors who wrote more slowly than George R R Martin" (haha) ... this entry for J R R Tolkien:
Â 
"Tolkien's epic trilogy (each roughly about 450-600 pages) about hobbits, elves, orcs and dwarves took about 16 years to write. In comparison, the first three books ofÂ A Song of Ice and FireÂ are roughly between 700 and 1,000 pages, and Martin wrote and published them within nine years of each other."
Â 
Sigh.Â 
Â 
Like I said - didn't make me feel any better to know George is at least writing faster than Tolkien did.Â

I'm not sure they two are really fair to compare.Â  Tolkien started writing the trilogy almost right after the Hobbit was published, 1937.Â  However, this was a side job for him, and he worked full time as a university examiner.Â  Then, World War II happened.

Â 
Sure, it's probably not fair to compare how long it took Tolkien compared to Martin but the two are often compared as 'epic' fantasy writers with GRRM being the modern version. I only thought it was interesting trivia that tied in to the previous convo about how long it was taking George to write the next sequel while the show is quickly catching up. Once the show passes ADWD material fully, I am going to have to stop watching. I'll go nuts!!
4489	Twatbeards conspiracy	2014-05-07	But if the stuff may or may not be in the book, why stop watching?
4490	Grody Brody	2014-05-05	Watching again that amazing scene between Arya and the Hound ("I bet his hair's greasier than Joffrey's cunt" is the greatest line ever), I got to thinking:
Â 
In their scenes this season, (which have been some of the show's best, and another great pairing of characters featuring Arya - the actors are smashing it out of the park, but I digress) the Hound has been teaching Arya some harsh lessons about how the world works: mainly that big men with big swords can get what they want whenever they want it. In this scene, the advice is very practical:
Â 
"The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword!?" - i.e., always be armed and ready and on guard, and:
Â 
"Your friend's dead, and Meryn Trant's not, 'cause Trant had armour and a big fucking sword."
Â 
And it's this line that I wonder might be pointing towards her time in Braavos: this season she's learning her limitations, having been very lucky in previous times. With no Jaqen H'ghar or Hound to save her, she's just a little girl with a little sword that can't even pierce leather armour. If she wants to start knocking names off that list, she's going to have to learn some new skills that work within those limitations, or rather, play to her strengths (something Littlefinger talks about as well).
Â 
I know some people thought that maybe the show would skip her time in Braavos, but it seems like with all the mention of the Iron Bank that a trip to Braavos will eventually be on the cards, and perhaps we'll get to see her training to be an assassin after all.
Â 
Thoughts?
4491	Gurthnar	2014-05-06	Well we got a glimpse of Titan of Braavos in trailer for episode 6. I do not think they are going to waste time on envoys from Tywin or Davos (which are both possible based on what we have seen in the show up to now).
Â 
I think there is a good chance Arya is getting to Braavos in the next episode, which would be quite cool.

Arya is likely to not go to Braavos until episode 10.
4493	Gurthnar	2014-05-06	I doubt it is Davos and Stannis, since in the show it was made clear Davos is trying to contact Iron Bank behind Stannis' back. Furthermore, since he wants to make contact in secret, it is doubtful he will go in person. I think Stannis would question, why his Hand is sailing to Braavos in such troubled times. It could still be an envoy.
Â 
But I think our opinions are good as any, since the show is making departures from storylines and timelines of those storylines that remain more or less intact.
Â 
I agree that it would be a big jump in story for Arya (getting rid of Hound, getting to coast, booking a ship, making the journey) but I guess we will see.

It is absolutely Stannis and Davos, the same preview shows them in the bank with Mark Gatiss, who's cast as Tycho Nestoris of the Iron Bank. It is not a matter of opinion.

Sometimes I do not catch the dialogue and do not give it much thought until the whole episode comes out. Rewatched and you are absolutely right.

"the greatest swordsman alive got killed by Meryn fucking Trant?"
"any boywhore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants"
Â 
I wouldn't pay much heed to Sandor's assessment of Trant's skill. The latter may in fact be a very bad swordsman by historical KG standards but everything in The Hound's expression suggests he's doing a kind of a humblebrag
Â 
Regardless, I do believe Syrio is alive
4498	Theda Baratheon	2014-05-06	I definitely think this was a little taster of her combat skills and a hint that she will be going to braavos and the FM after all.

The latter may in fact be a very bad swordsman by historical KG standards but everything in The Hound's expression suggests he's doing a kind of a humblebragI do like the Hound's fighting style, in the tavern brawl it was like I would I imagine, no one is trying to score fencing points everybody is just trying to kill him and he's a better brawler than they are. He does not even use his sword that much , it's all chaos, Sandor coldcocks a couple of palookas before giging them. That's a real bar fight!
4500	Ice_and_Fire	2014-05-06	I've not seen any theories that the tv show would omit her Bravos story, I don't see how they could possibly do that! Haha I mean that IS her story arc.Â 
I do think they are reminding tv viewers of Syrio and her link to Bravos through him so it won't be completely out of the blue when she leaves... although if that is the case I imagine they will need to show her with her coin in an upcoming episode to refresh that as well.Â 
Also I think this scene is as good as proof that Syrio is alive ;-)
4501	Fat Trell	2014-05-06	Syrio is dead, he's dead. He's been dead, he will remain dead. He served his narriative purpose, he had an excellent death. Bringing Syrio back would serve no purpose what so ever. 
I rather liked this scene as establishing that for all of Arya's fancy footwork, she is not a fighter. She needs to find her own lane to kill her enemies.

Â 
spoiler:Â  Doesn't she skewer Raff with Needle?Â  She apparently retrieves it for her internship with the Gate mummers.Â  But this may not be the answer to what you are asking.
Â 
I DEFINITELY agree that the FM know all about Arya - and that she is guided to Braavos for a purpose - I mean, the kindly man - I think - knows she is a warg and skinchanger.Â  Arya's FM traiing has coincidentally drawn forth the powers innate to her blood of the First Men.Â  The FM most certainly know about Needle.Â  I also agree that Arya is destined to be much more than a FM assassin

4503	Bastard of the Dreadfort	2014-05-06	Braavos has been mentioned that many times this season that I have no doubt Arya will end up there by the end of episode 10 (at the earliest).
4504	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-06	The other thing that changed for Arya or at least was revealed is that she has added Thorros and Beric to her list. Two characters who have been portrayed as being more on the good side than the bad side of things. This brings Arya into a greyer area than she was before. Also keeping the hound on the list shows that whether or not a character has redeemed themselves or is on the path to redemption means nothing to her. She is without mercy. The world is very black and white to her now. If she feels you have wronged her or those she cares about she will find you and she will kill you (in a liam neeson-esque voice).
4505	Grody Brody	2014-05-06	Syrio is dead, he's dead. He's been dead, he will remain dead. He served his narriative purpose, he had an excellent death. Bringing Syrio back would serve no purpose what so ever.

Â 
Exactly. The point the Hound was making is not that Meryn Trant was shit and Syrio was awesome, therefore Syrio must have survived - it's that being the so-called greatest swordsman who ever lived means nothing if you're unarmed and up against an armoured knight with a "big fucking sword".
Â 
And if that's how it works for the greatest swordsman who ever lived, how much more so it must work for Arya, who is a teeny tiny little girl with a teeny tiny sword. She got a free shot at the Hound and she couldn't even puncture his armour, and then he bitchslapped her. Note that the Hound was unarmed and he still managed to disarm her when she tried to kill him, and he didn't even break a sweat. Consider Cersei's conversation with Oberyn in the same episode: "All over the world, they hurt little girls." This scene was about reminding Arya that she's not as tough as she thinks.
4506	gotgrrrl	2014-05-06	They absolutely need to keep Arya going to Braavos, it's one of the best parts of the books!Â  Her time in the House of Black and White was creepy and weird.Â  I loved it.Â

Question:Â  In the books, does Arya know about Joffrey's death before she goes to Braavos?Â  I've forgotten the timeline on this.Â  I'm assuming show Arya doesn't know, nor does she know about Sansa's escape form KL.Â  Do you think she'll find out from someone on her trip to the Eyrie?Â  I imagine news of Joffrey's death is widespread in Westeros, as well as the main suspects being Tyrion and Sansa.Â
4507	Envie	2014-05-06	Â 
Exactly. The point the Hound was making is not that Meryn Trant was shit and Syrio was awesome, therefore Syrio must have survived - it's that being the so-called greatest swordsman who ever lived means nothing if you're unarmed and up against an armoured knight with a "big fucking sword".
Â 
And if that's how it works for the greatest swordsman who ever lived, how much more so it must work for Arya, who is a teeny tiny little girl with a teeny tiny sword. She got a free shot at the Hound and she couldn't even puncture his armour, and then he bitchslapped her. Note that the Hound was unarmed and he still managed to disarm her when she tried to kill him, and he didn't even break a sweat. Consider Cersei's conversation with Oberyn in the same episode: "All over the world, they hurt little girls." This scene was about reminding Arya that she's not as tough as she thinks.


Â 
While yes I agree this scene shows Arya she cannot hope to fight against big men with armor and long swords - - I think the greater message here, as others have pointed out, is being missed by some of you. Arya is a survivor and a fighter and already has killed men without batting an eye at it ... she was just shown that in order to survive she's going to have to learn ways to fight OTHER than water dancing or sword fighting.Â 
Â 
This scene was definitely a set up as a lead in to her going to Braavos. It's a clear reminder that she learned a lot from Syrio Forel but that she has much more to learn if she's going to ever hope to fight against big men with swords. She knows that half the people on her hit list are way stronger or more well protected than she is - so now she's going to have to ask herself HOW is she going to kill them then at all if she's just a little girl with a needle?
Â 
Well we already know the answer to that - she's got to become a trained assassin, where her small size, ability to move quickly and quietly and possibly her warging abilities will come in very handy to overcome the fact she cannot hope to best knights in armor with heavy swords.
Â 
The lesson learned in this well done scene was not lost on show viewers. They'll remember this when she gets that coin out and presents it to those who will take her to the next step in her career.
4508	Newstar	2014-05-06	Having heard Arya's TV death list in its entirety, I wonder if (spoilers for TWOW)
	Spoiler Ser Meryn will somehow wind up in Braavos and he will be the one whom Arya kills as she did Raff.
4509	Snowisnobastard	2014-05-04	He does things that he did not do in the books, brans non book actions also weirdly paralled his in this episode. Bran snapping lockes neck via Hodor and Jon stabbing jeor's skull drinker through the mouth weren't in the books but felt very similar/satisfying. Are they setting up an early connection for bran to save Jon via the weirwood trees or are they setting Jon up to be the next hero only to have him die after his caesaring at the wall?

I don't thinkÂ "false hero" isÂ the right phrase heroÂ False hero implies someone we think is a hero but instead he is a villainÂ /bad person.Â JonÂ might notÂ be the main hero of the book orÂ yet another tragicÂ hero but definatelyÂ not a false hero/ (unless GRRM makes him turn badÂ in the nextÂ book)Â Â
4511	sj4iy	2014-05-05	I'm not really sure what 'false hero' means here. Â They are setting him up to be a leader of the Night's Watch. Â In the books, it always felt a bit sudden to me, that Jon would be elected right after he was nearly executed for treason. Â I like what they are doing here...giving Jon time to redeem himself in the eyes of his brothers and growing into the role of a leader. Â Doing something heroic doesn't make Jon the 'hero' of the show...but it does help the audience believe that he can be the LC of the Night's Watch.
4512	TheHouseHB	2014-05-05	I think if anything they were setting up Jon as the "Hero" and Dany as the "False Hero".Â
4513	~DarkHorse~	2014-05-05	Â As far as 'heroes' on the show go I think Dany is being set up as the mainÂ protagonist but Jon is the dark horse.
Â 
They both have some interesting parallels-
Â 
Dany freeing slaves and Jon freeing Crasters daughters/wives.
Â 
"I will serve injustice with justice"Â Â  "All we can do now is bring him justice"
Â 
However, the daughters/wivesÂ Jon has freed don't follow him they make their own way as opposed to the slaves Dany has freed following her. Also, very interesting how Dany has the slave master (oppressor of the unsullied) burnt and Jon burns Craster's keep which is symbolic of the oppression/cruelty toward the woman there.
Â 
I definitely think their might be a future Jon/Bran interaction or dependence on each other scene at some point considering Jon knows Bran is alive and Bran wanted to go to Jon but realised his duty came first (love the parallels that has to Jon) so we might eventually see them interact which will be very satisfying. Perhaps, when Jon is resurrected or healing?
4514	~No One~	2014-05-05	I think if anything they were setting up Jon as the "Hero" and Dany as the "False Hero".

+1
4515	Natalie Underfoot	2014-05-05	I think if anything they were setting up Jon as the "Hero" and Dany as the "False Hero".Â 


Truth. Â They are so opposite yet feel very similar. Overly empathetic, detached in some way from their lineage (R+L=J implied) yet Jon has none of the self-assurance Dany gained so easily although he hasn't had quite the cadre of older men following him around and kissing his ass like she has. Â He seems to struggle with every decision he makes, she reacts on instinct. Â Jon is hopefully becoming wiser while Dany is starting to realize she "knows nothing". Â 
Â 
I'm also biased as I've found the Targs a fascinating family but wow they really should NOT ever have power again while I find the Stark's my kind of people. Â I also really like winter and hate summer so maybe there's where it's coming from
4516	sj4iy	2014-05-05	As far as 'heroes' on the show go I think Dany is being set up as the mainÂ protagonist but Jon is the dark horse.Â They both have some interesting parallels-Not sure if I would say that they are direct parallels, though.Â Dany freeing slaves and Jon freeing Crasters daughters/wives.Except that Dany is on a crusade, whereas Jon is doing it to keep the Wildlings from learning about the NW's defenses.Â "I will serve injustice with justice"Â Â  "All we can do now is bring him justice"Â The difference here is that Dany just chose people at random to die. Jon and the others killed those directly responsible for the deaths of their fellow brothers.Â However, the daughters/wivesÂ Jon has freed don't follow him they make their own way as opposed to the slaves Dany has freed following her. Also, very interesting how Dany has the slave master (oppressor of the unsullied) burnt and Jon burns Craster's keep which is symbolic of the oppression/cruelty toward the woman there.Jon allowed the women to make the decision for themselves, and they chose to burn it. Dany is going around as a 'mother' figure, so it makes sense that the slaves are following her.Â I definitely think their might be a future Jon/Bran interaction or dependence on each other scene at some point considering Jon knows Bran is alive and Bran wanted to go to Jon but realised his duty came first (love the parallels that has to Jon) so we might eventually see them interact which will be very satisfying. Perhaps, when Jon is resurrected or healing?I agree that it seems that Bran will have some sort of influence over Jon after the stabbing.

"I will serve injustice with justice"Â Â  "All we can do now is bring him justice"
Â 


Â 
This parallel really stuck out at me too while watching and I wondered if others picked up on it and if it was even done intentionally or not. Lately I have no idea what the writer's are intending to do purposely and which things are just happening and I'm reading way too much into it.
Â 
I feel like they're really building up Dany and Jon as similar "Good" characters - both are heroes for their cause and both are being portrayed as true heroes. I don't know if that means they're just building up viewers for another shocker down the road or if one or both of these characters go on to become the real end-game heroes or not. Since we're now moving into uncharted territory I pretty much take everything said and done in the show with a huge ton of salt, not just a grain.
Â 
I'm becoming very skeptical of everything hinted in the show.
Â 
We know what happens to both Jon and Dany but only up to a certain point where we're left hanging waiting to find out more.
Â 
Jon is definitely a 'hero' at this point - but does he ever really stop being a 'hero' character in the books?
4518	Stone Cold Bastard	2014-05-05	I think if anything they were setting up Jon as the "Hero" and Dany as the "False Hero".Â 


Â 
Spot on.
Â 
While Dany has shown a cruel and cunning side, and possibly some of that Targaryen madness, Jon has been much more stoic, grounded and learning from his mistakes, while also benefitting from the guidance of Benjen, LC Mormont and the Halfhand.
4519	ToTheWolves	2014-05-05	I'm not really sure what 'false hero' means here. Â They are setting him up to be a leader of the Night's Watch.

I didn't even think of that! That makes sense fine with me!
4520	lostinwesteros	2014-05-05	Like many of the posts so far, I definitely see Jon as an ultimate hero (come on, now, R+L = J!), and I can also easily see some sort of joining of forces between him and Bran eventually.  Maybe that's one of the reveals that D and D have from Martin, thus their engineering these two 'near misses' of a reunion, to help set that up.  
Most unsullied I know LOVE Dany, but I'm not a fan.  Given what I think is her and Jon's aunt/nephew relationship, that could really set up a major conflict, whether they know their true relationship or not.  Could go either way, I guess, since I really don't think Jon wants anything to do with sitting the IT.
4521	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-05	I really don't think there are morally good or bad characters at all. There are just some that are worse than others. A case could be made against all of them especially Dany with her narcissistic messiah complex. If she were a GOOD person surely she should have sold the dragon eggs and gone to live a quiet and peaceful life in the house with the red door. She thinks she has a birth right to rule over half the world. And she doesn't care how many people have to die for her to get it.
Â 
Jon on the other hand, I....just can't come up with any real flaws that he has. It's like he's too perfect. Which compared to every other character in the series makes him a little one dimensional. I would start liking or caring about Jon's stroyline more if he weren't so bloody perfect.

I would start liking or caring about Jon's stroyline more if he weren't so bloody perfect.He's impulsive and lets his temper get the best of him at times. He's not perfect at all (he was a showoff, he nearly quit because he didn't get to be a ranger, he attacked Thorne, he tried to desert, etc)- but I think that, compared with Daenerys, he looks like a saint simply because she has the power to do bad things on a larger scale and has done them, whereas he hasn't had that power.
4523	Snowisnobastard	2014-05-05	Jon is my favorite character, as corny as that is. This episode was the first to really show him going ape-shit hero. While that pleases me it also makes me worry that he is going to end up as another Rob. I just can't figure out whether he will truly be the hero or if they are setting him up to be another "false hero" and have him killed off. (And yes I have read adwd but I don't think that was his end)
Not sure why there is so much debate over the meaning of false hero, false hero does not mean villain, It means a person that was proposed as a hero who is not.
4524	Widows_Blood	2014-05-05	GRRM has established Jon as more of the "classic hero" archetype. The Aragorn, Luke Skywalker type. Hidden family origin, honorable, compassionate etc... I think people saying Dany is being set up as an antagonist don't understand her story very well.Â
4525	Dreams Of Spring	2014-05-05	Jon is my favorite character, as corny as that is. This episode was the first to really show him going ape-shit hero.

Â 
I certainly hope that Jon Snow is NOT being built up as a hero just to be another Robb, that would really irritate me to no end.
4526	Snowisnobastard	2014-05-05	Me as well, I don't think I could forgive the series for that...
4527	Banner Without Brothers	2014-05-06	He's impulsive and lets his temper get the best of him at times.

 Â  Thanks for your reply. Good points made.
Â 
I think most of everything he has done so far is understandable or at most he's been stopped and changed his mind about certain things, if it were someone like Cersei she would not have changed her mind and just found another way to get what she wanted. But you're absolutely right that only when characters have power do they have to face those hard and morally questionable decisions such as Dany has had to make. I'm still reading and haven't got to Jon becoming Lord Commander yet. I will be looking forward to seeing how he does once he gets some real power. His decisions obviously don't prove to be universally liked due to the knife in his back.
4528	MoA«t	2014-05-05	This isn't a flame. And this is only directed at all of you complaining about "book spoilers" as if someone just killed your dog. Â 
Â 
Every week, I come here to share thoughts and read people's opinions about this amazing series of books and show, and for the most part it's a really fun experience, and I'm so grateful for this site. But it's so depressing to read the same rage and anger coming from some of the book readers about the show spoiling them.
Â 
We all know book spoilers are coming at this point. I for one love it. It's thrilling. I'm also fully aware the show isn't the books.
Â 
Why are you even watching the show if being spoiled means so much to you? Why not just wait for the books, then once you read them all after they're eventually released, go back and watch the show, and compare the two?
Â 
If you insist on watching the show, why can't you just accept that there are two different ways to tell the same story?
Â 
So far, there is no "Butterfly Effect" that will massively change the overall main arc/plot of the story to the point it ends differently. Romeo and Juliet are never going to live happily ever after.Â Yes, many characters will probably take a different path to get to the same eventual outcome, but the overall plot so far hasn't changed.
Â 
Example: Bran and Jon. Bran and Jon never met North of The Wall in the books, and they didn't in the show either. Sure, Jon doesn't even know in the books, but the change gave Bran a much needed moment of grown-up decision making he doesn't have in the books.
Â 
Robb & Talisa - We know little about Robb in the books (compared with the show) because we're never given an opportunity to be in his head in the books, since he's not a POV character. The show's changes gave him much higher stakes along with everyone he came in contact with - yet all the pieces still fell into place like they should.
Â 
Cat, Cersei, Stannis, Tyrion, Jamie, and any other character you feel has been the recipient of "character assassination" (there's so many at this point, I can't even remember all of them, so I'll assume every character from the books that has made it into the show has someone out there who feels they've been CA'd....) Â They're still going to die, they're still going to go where they're supposed to, and they're still going to kill the people they should. I'm sorry if Cat is too nice for you in the show. But Lady Stoneheart will still be in the show, and she will still kill Freys. Tyrion will still kill Tywin and Shea. Jamie will still free Tyrion, and leave KL. Cersei will still go insane. But the beauty of these changes is that we don't have any one character's extreme bias clouding our judgement because we only see everything through their eyes.Â 
Â 
So far (for me) every change that's been made has been for the better, because it's heightened the drama for all of the characters involved, and given many of them more to do, and a better, well-rounded characterization.
Â 
GRRM is an Executive Producer. Of course he knows what's going on regarding the writing for GoT. We know he's sat down with D&D and gone over the story and where it all ends up, so they don't have to make shit up and guess.Â 
Â 
I for one, am thankful that we have so many big time ASOIAF fans who are writing for and in charge of this show - David, Dan, and Bryan, that also understand the logistics of film/TV making, so we don't end up completely off the rails like True Blood. Might that happen? Sure, anything is possible. But I really doubt that will happen with GoT.
Â 
And if I'm missing something - there's a character that should be dead on the show, but isn't.... (yes there are plenty who are dead on the show that are alive in the books, but where are any of them needed to advance a plot point that can't be advanced by another secondary character?) ... please let me know. I've only read the books once, so I'm obviously not as up to speed as most people here.Â 
Â 
Anyway - just my two coppers... Keep calm - and BE HAPPY - we're so lucky to have this amazing show and that HBO loves it and is willing to keep throwing money at it.Â 
Â
4529	MidnightKiss	2014-05-05	We all know book spoilers are coming at this point.
Â 

Â 
No, I didn't.Â 
Â 
Fortunately I read the Arya sample chapter before I saw that "used" in this season but the Others spoiler took me completely by surprise and I didn't like that at all. This season is the second half of book 3. It's reasonable of me to expect that there won't be material used from the unpublished book 6.Â 
Â 
I'm a long term fan of the books, I bought the first one in paperback when it came out in 1997 and I've reread them many times. I'm not nearly as knowledgeable about them as some people on this forum but I love them. I've been patient. The books take a long time to write.
Â 
Quite a while ago, GRRM teased us that there was more to learn about the place beyond the wall and the wildlings. I've been eager to learn what this was. So I wasn't pleased at all to see a 1 minute scene giving away a big chunk of that storyline (when taken together with the HBO summary reveal). I feel angry that the Others spoiler was just given away so easily. Don't the loyal book fans who've waited years and years to find out what happens next deserve a bit more respect? I'm also sad that when I read about the Others in the next book I'll already know what happens and that spoils my enjoyment of that part of the book. I'm sad because GRRM's prose is often so beautiful/witty/elegant and I want to read that and have that as my impression of the scene.Â 
Â 
One of the biggest reasons people love a book is because they care about what happens to the characters. So it's no surprise that people care about how those book characters are portrayed onscreen. I agree with you that some of the changes to the storylines give characters something to do when they have quieter times in the books. Books comfortably have quieter times, shows can't. I disagree entirely with you that characters are better with a more rounded characterization. When they tone down who a character is they make them less unique.Â 
Â 
It's a shame that Stannis isn't as moral and brittle as he is in the book, that Arya never got to be scared and a nobody at Harrenhal and now she's so ruthless already. I know there isn't enough screen time to really portray the characters as they are in the books so I just urge interested people to read the books too. I get the impression you love the action of the books and you're happy that the show has more action. I love the action but I love the characters and their reasonings & nuances too.Â 
Â 
Your Robb & Bran examples don't make sense to me (sorry):
Â 
Robb didn't have any "higher stakes" for me in the series than the books. He married for honor's sake in the books (which connected nicely with Stark honor and his father's character), as well as some love. He married for love and lust in the series. The stakes never changed because the outcome with the Freys was the same. Only her being pregnant was different (which I saw as a cliche, isn't her and everyone else dying enough?).Â 
Â 
Bran does have a moment of "grown up decision making" in the book. He was told the rest would follow his choice and he chose not to seek refuge with any of his fathers old friends and bannermen but to go onwards and seek the three eyed crow. Because no matter which household he'd go to, he'd always be a cripple. Later he pleaded with Sam not to tell Jon he was going beyond the Wall.
Â 
Anyways. Don't get mad or depressed at how other people view the series compared to the books. Just understand that they see and feel it completely differently to you. And none of us can change anything that HBO or GRRM does.Â 
Â 
Personally I've decided to keep watching this season as I'm hopeful there will be no more big book spoilers. Then I'm going to pray that the next book comes out before the start of the next season. Otherwise I may stop watching until it's out. You think that will be easy? To avoid all the show spoilers online and asking friends & colleagues to stop talking about it many times. Hearing/Seeing spoilers will be inevitable :-(
Â 
I'll also have to give up reading this forum. That would be sad because it's given me my "Ice and Fire fix" to keep me going through the many years of waiting for new books to come out.
Â 
So I'll cross my fingers, say a little prayer, rub the Budda's belly and live in delightfully deceptive hope that the next book will be out early next year.Â

4530	sj4iy	2014-05-05	This season is the second half of book 3. It's reasonable of me to expect that there won't be material used from the unpublished book 6.Â Except that it's not. There are parts from book 4 (Brienne and Pod have started their journey together), parts from book 5 (Bran's journey to BR) and even parts from book 6 (Stannis meets with Tycho Nestoris about financing). The show has no obligation to follow the storyline exactly...they move things around to fit the structure of the narrative that they are trying to tell. Saying that "It should to follow the books exactly" is disingenuous, because while the books may be a rough guideline, they don't translate to television exactly. It is up to the individual to decide which medium they would rather see or read the story in first...it's not up to the filmmakers to not spoil the book readers who don't want to know what happens until they have read it first.

Hearing/Seeing spoilers will be inevitable :-(
Â 
I'll also have to give up reading this forum. That would be sad because it's given me my "Ice and Fire fix" to keep me going through the many years of waiting for new books to come out.
Â 
So I'll cross my fingers, say a little prayer, rub the Budda's belly and live in delightfully deceptive hope that the next book will be out early next year.If you're "a long term fan of the books", you must be familiar with GRRM and his repeated introductory notes to books 4 & 5 where he explains the last 25% - 30% of book 3, all of book 4, and most of book 5 happen simultaneously.
I don't recall, but were you enraged by getting Theon's book 5 story in season 3? Why or why not? It happened correctly in the overall timeline, but in book 3's season. 
What about Jojen & Meera not appearing until last season?
Are you enraged by the show not telling the story via POV storytelling? Again, why or why not? How do you think that would work in a visual medium?
Do you think the HotU should have been shot like the books? Even though it would be full of spoilers, and likely be prohibitively expensive we would only have heard dragons in season2 instead of seeing them.
Seeing as you feel entitled to not being spoiled by a TV show, and that HBO is somehow obligated to not go past the point of the published books, both of which seem utterly outrageous and completely unrealistic to me personally, you should definitely stop watching, since you're clearly setting yourself up for disappointment.Except that it's not. There are parts from book 4 (Brienne and Pod have started their journey together), parts from book 5 (Bran's journey to BR) and even parts from book 6 (Stannis meets with Tycho Nestoris about financing). The show has no obligation to follow the storyline exactly...they move things around to fit the structure of the narrative that they are trying to tell. Saying that "It should to follow the books exactly" is disingenuous, because while the books may be a rough guideline, they don't translate to television exactly. It is up to the individual to decide which medium they would rather see or read the story in first...it's not up to the filmmakers to not spoil the book readers who don't want to know what happens until they have read it first.

Exactly.

4532	Tquinn BC	2014-05-05	This isn't a flame. And this is only directed at all of you complaining about "book spoilers" as if someone just killed your dog. Â 
Â 
Every week, I come here to share thoughts and read people's opinions about this amazing series of books and show, and for the most part it's a really fun experience, and I'm so grateful for this site. But it's so depressing to read the same rage and anger coming from some of the book readers about the show spoiling them.
Â 
We all know book spoilers are coming at this point. I for one love it. It's thrilling. I'm also fully aware the show isn't the books.
Â 
Why are you even watching the show if being spoiled means so much to you? Why not just wait for the books, then once you read them all after they're eventually released, go back and watch the show, and compare the two?
Â 
If you insist on watching the show, why can't you just accept that there are two different ways to tell the same story?
Â 
So far, there is no "Butterfly Effect" that will massively change the overall main arc/plot of the story to the point it ends differently. Romeo and Juliet are never going to live happily ever after.Â Yes, many characters will probably take a different path to get to the same eventual outcome, but the overall plot so far hasn't changed.
Â 
Example: Bran and Jon. Bran and Jon never met North of The Wall in the books, and they didn't in the show either. Sure, Jon doesn't even know in the books, but the change gave Bran a much needed moment of grown-up decision making he doesn't have in the books.
Â 
Robb & Talisa - We know little about Robb in the books (compared with the show) because we're never given an opportunity to be in his head in the books, since he's not a POV character. The show's changes gave him much higher stakes along with everyone he came in contact with - yet all the pieces still fell into place like they should.
Â 
Cat, Cersei, Stannis, Tyrion, Jamie, and any other character you feel has been the recipient of "character assassination" (there's so many at this point, I can't even remember all of them, so I'll assume every character from the books that has made it into the show has someone out there who feels they've been CA'd....) Â They're still going to die, they're still going to go where they're supposed to, and they're still going to kill the people they should. I'm sorry if Cat is too nice for you in the show. But Lady Stoneheart will still be in the show, and she will still kill Freys. Tyrion will still kill Tywin and Shea. Jamie will still free Tyrion, and leave KL. Cersei will still go insane. But the beauty of these changes is that we don't have any one character's extreme bias clouding our judgement because we only see everything through their eyes.Â 
Â 
So far (for me) every change that's been made has been for the better, because it's heightened the drama for all of the characters involved, and given many of them more to do, and a better, well-rounded characterization.
Â 
GRRM is an Executive Producer. Of course he knows what's going on regarding the writing for GoT. We know he's sat down with D&D and gone over the story and where it all ends up, so they don't have to make shit up and guess.Â 
Â 
I for one, am thankful that we have so many big time ASOIAF fans who are writing for and in charge of this show - David, Dan, and Bryan, that also understand the logistics of film/TV making, so we don't end up completely off the rails like True Blood. Might that happen? Sure, anything is possible. But I really doubt that will happen with GoT.
Â 
And if I'm missing something - there's a character that should be dead on the show, but isn't.... (yes there are plenty who are dead on the show that are alive in the books, but where are any of them needed to advance a plot point that can't be advanced by another secondary character?) ... please let me know. I've only read the books once, so I'm obviously not as up to speed as most people here.Â 
Â 
Anyway - just my two coppers... Keep calm - and BE HAPPY - we're so lucky to have this amazing show and that HBO loves it and is willing to keep throwing money at it.Â 
Â 


Â 
I quoted this so people will read it again.
Â 
And people need to this read this, several times, several... several times
4533	Cyril	2014-05-05	I didn't like it upon watching, but after further consideration, I've come to love the Bran turning away from Jon scene.Â  It gives Bran a chance to show he is actively making a choice and recognizes what he has given up, a choice he never really had outside of the scene with Samwell.Â  And with Samwell, it's not as strong; you're going to be further tormented when faced with someone you know instead of an acquaintance of your acquaintance.Â  He could have had safety and security with someone he loved.Â  Instead he is taking a risk for himself and what he believes to be the greater good.
Â 
I'm not sure why there's so much hate towards the scene, to be quite honest.

Â 
I'm not sure why there's so much hate towards the scene, to be quite honest.
Yes. We see several images of Jon from Bran's POV, it's as tho he wants to fill his mind with memories of his brother as he appears at this moment, because he knows he must go on. I've been torn between love and duty before, & this is just how it feels. It leant some much needed pathos to Bran's situation, something I'm not even sure he felt when parting from Rickon. He's sadder now & wiser. I really FELT this scene. I'm a twice-thru bookreader, & I found I could appreciate this scene very much.
4535	lostinwesteros	2014-05-05	I was very upset in earlier seasons when I started seeing things from the book left out of the TV series, or things added to the show that weren't in the books, but before long I came to realize book and show are two different things.  
Each TV season has ten, only ten, shows in which to tell the story that took Martin a thousand pages,to tell.  I've got some pet peeves about changes I didn't like at all (Talisa, e.g.) but there are also some changes I really loved.  
Introducing Theon/Reek so early was one that I didn't like at all at first, but now I see why, for the TV series, it fits better to have it happen that way.
4536	StrollofShame	2014-05-05	I don't mean to be snarky-sounding here, but it almost seems to me that some book fans want to blame anyone and everyone for the fact that the books are not finished yet. It is not the fault of the show, nor the fault of those who are supportive of the show, nor the fault of posters here who love the show that the BOOKS are not finished! That fault lies with one individual. This individual will, short of a miracle, not complete the series before the show must conclude, & many grieve rigorously over that fact. But it is what it is. Let go, accept, or refuse to accept if you will, but don't fault the show for the author's failures. Sometimes that seems to be what's happening, I fear.
4537	Seneti	2014-05-06	Yes, many characters will probably take a different path to get to the same eventual outcome, but the overall plot so far hasn't changed.

Â 
Yessss. So much yes.
4539	DrownedSnow	2014-05-06	What do people think has been worse? The book readers enjoying watching people's reactions to events like the Red Wedding or the show watchers making thing book readers since last week because something unreleased may have been spoiled and "books suck" or something like that? Just seen a lot of show watchers commenting about how books readers can suck it. It's a very "bro" attitude that was a bit odd to see and reminds you that the show draws all kinds.
Â 
Â 
Â 
as for the spoilers I'm fine with it. I love the books and the show. Whichever gives me an ending first is who I will get my ending from. Hopefully GRRM will actually finish the series some day but until then nothing is going to ruin my desire to read them.
Â 
I just think that people are too concerned over spoilers these days. I started reading the books because I was spoiled about Ned's death before the 3rd episode even aired. It didn't take anything away when I read it later and then saw it on the show. I think that spoilers are largely what you make them. Movie trailers often spoil tons of things for us but usually not enough to lessen our enjoyment. Some big reveals would suck to know about but those are rare. If you decide not to let it bother you then it won't bother you.
4540	Inv1ctus	2014-05-06	Well I think it's safe to say GRRM doesn't care about the readers anymore, neither does he care about his magnum opus of ASOIAF. And if the decision for that is because he just wants to live a little, travel the world, meeting new people and engage in some other projects or passions he had previously in his life, not just write the books day in day out for years to come. Who am I to deny an old man that? With all that said I would still very much like to read the new books, but I'm not gonna say screw you GRRM you have to write these books and nothing else. Also there is a possibility that he realized he would need more books to finish up all the storylines than he previously thought. That could be very demoralizing, him looking down the road for the next decade. I really hope that isn't the case and that he will only need seven books, because then we still have a decent chance of seeing this story to the end.Â
4541	ToTheWolves	2014-05-06	Best thread ever...hope people read this.
4542	MidnightKiss	2014-05-06	Moet, I replied to your thread because you said it "wasn't a flame" and it was written in an even tempered way. You asked people to "Keep calm - and BE HAPPY"
Â 
So I'm disappointed to come back and have you repeatedly ask me whether I was "enraged" by certain things HBO did. That's not the language I used. You are not calm or happy that I replied.Â 
Â 
I don't mind if they move around the published story. They need to make it work onscreen where characters can't disappear for long periods of time. I personally found that book 5 had a lot of cliffhangers so I expect that when HBO dramatize those storylines onscreen they may well take some of the cliffhanger-endings in book 6 and add them in. That would be sensible.
Â 
If you're "a long term fan of the books", you must be familiar with GRRM and his repeated introductory notes to books 4 & 5 where he explains the last 25% - 30% of book 3, all of book 4, and most of book 5 happen simultaneously.
Â 

Â 
Ouch. I'm not the long term fan of the books I described myself as, if I'm not familiar with these repeated introductory notes? Well I'm not familiar with what you say they are. I know that book 4 and 5 mostly happen at the same time. I'm well aware he split them and one day I'd love to see them published in some massive volume together. But repeated introductory notes? Book 3? No, I'm not familiar with that so I went and picked up my books again.Â 
Â 
Book 3 "A Note on Chronology" GRRM writes that "A Storm of Swords does not follow the closing chapters of A Clash of Kings so much as overlap them".Â 
Â 
Nothing there about books 4 & 5 because they hadn't been written yet.
Â 
Book 4 "Meanwhile, back on the Wall..." at the end of the book he wrote "I was still writing when it dawned on me that the book had become too big to publish in a single volume... and I wasn't close to finished yet. To tell all of the story that I wanted to tell, I was going to have to cut the book in two."
Â 
Book 5 "A Cavil on Chronology" he states that "The book you hold in your hands is the fifth volume of a Song of Ice and Fire. The forth volume was a Feast of Crows. However, this volume does not follow that one in the traditional sense, so much as run in tandem with it."
Â 
These are the notes I've read. I did buy them when they were first published and there have been many reprints since. Are there other notes in these? There's no reason for me to have read them if there are. GRRM never wrote in my copies that book 3 was 25-30% simultaneous with books 4 & 5.
Â 
The characters change a bit in the series, the plotlines do too. And I'm fairly ok with that. I don't like it but I understand that it had to be done to bring the show to TV.Â 
Â 
But I was angry that they showed a significant plot spoiler from the unpublished book 6 in a storyline that was, for the large majority, all about the second half of book 3. After I got over my anger I was and remain, deeply disappointed.Â 
Â 
Seeing as you feel entitled to not being spoiled by a TV show, and that HBO is somehow obligated to not go past the point of the published books, both of which seem utterly outrageous and completely unrealistic to me personally, you should definitely stop watching, since you're clearly setting yourself up for disappointment.
Â 

Â 
Sigh. Whatever happened to being calm and happy?
Â 
Do I want to read about book 6 before seeing it onscreen? Yes.
Do I know that season 5 is likely to have bits of Winds of Winter in it? Yes.
Do I have to make my own decision about watching season 5? Yes.
Do I feel it's unreasonable to expect that season 4 (which is mainly about the second half of book 3) will use unpublished book 6 material in it? No.
Do I feel that there should have been a "spoiler announcement" warning about season 4? Might have been nice.Â 
Â 
I don't feel that HBO is obligated not to go past the point of the published books so much as GRRM has a duty to fans to publish the books before HBO gets there. Oh dear. That last line will probably get me into trouble. This is how I honestly feel:
Â 
GRRM has a loyal following of book fans who have waited and enjoyed his books and sung his praises since 1996. Then the books are made into TV and now there are legions of TV fans, many more than the book fans. The book fans cheer along with the TV fans, happy for GRRM's success. But then there comes a point when the TV fans are more important and they will get the storylines first. Sorry book fans, your loyalty and reading of the books, without which a TV series would never have existed, isn't as important now. It's like someone turning their back on their old friends and inviting only their new friends to a party.Â 
Â 
Huh. I've realised that in this, I'm a Stark. I feel it's the honourable and moral thing to do, to publish the books first. Being a Stark doesn't end up too well in the books and neither will my dreams of reading the books without seeing/hearing spoilers about them.
Â 
You can say I'm wrong, you can write that my feelings are "utterly outrageous and completely unrealistic" but it doesn't change how I feel. In this modern world I can have old fashioned values in some things. I believe it's the right, honourable, moral thing to not let down long term fans who want to read the books first.
Â 
I know I'm in a no-win situation. I'm aware that right now there's little chance of the next book coming before the next season, which is bound to have significant spoilers. I know that I can either watch the show and have my book enjoyment spoiled. Or not watch it and end up hearing/reading spoilers anyways (the show is in all the national newspapers, there are plenty of clips and trailers to avoid so it's not just asking people not to tell me.)
Â 
So what I'm choosing is to exist in a little bubble of self delusion.To hope that the next book might come out just before the next season on TV. That way I don't have to face that my enjoyment of the next book is going to be spoiled one way or another. It already has been with the reveal of the Others.
Â 
I'll float off now in that little bubble and remember your original words encouraging everyone to be calm and happy. I wish the same for you. Be calm and happy and enjoy your day.
4543	Chebyshov	2014-05-06	Well I think it's safe to say GRRM doesn't care about the readers anymore, neither does he care about his magnum opus of ASOIAF.


Â 
I don't think it's safe to say that; the man has writer's block. I'm sure he doesn't love being in this situation either, but we've all known since AFFC came out that he's struggling to finish this off. The time-jump would have helped, IMO, but we are where we are. I think saying things like "GRRM doesn't care" isn't helpful, and isn't accurate.
Â 
That being said, I agree with the OP's sentiments.
Â 
People are upset that book spoilers are coming this season, which seems soon. Some weren't expecting spoilers until Season 7. But I'm of the mind that TWOW will not be released before next season, and given where some characters (Bran, Brienne) are in their arc, we were going to be getting spoilers next season anyway. The way I see it, we'll likely have the same amount of book content in our hands this time next year, so what difference does it make if the spoilers start in Season 4?
Â 
I think the main thing is that some people were in denial about TWOW's release date (note: when an editor says 2015Â at the earliest, you can probably assume you won't have it by April). I'm just happy to see how this great, great series concludes...the medium is less important to me.
4544	Fylimar	2014-05-06	That's a really good thread. Normally, I'm really dissapointed, when someone makes a movie or show out of my favorite books - I'm very critical about that. It happend so with Lord of the rings (I hate the movies with all my passionÂ   ) and Harry Potter (where I only like the actors ... mostly), but I love Game of Thrones. I read the books while watching the first season ( I watched two episodes, then read the first book and then watched the rest of the episodes, before season two, I was through the books a second timeÂ   ) and I think, they did a really good job in bringing GRRM's world to live.
I don't mind, if they spoil a few things for us bookreaders on the way - wasn't really upset about NK, just very excited - , because I think, there is still enough left for the books. But I can fully understand MidnightKIss and others, who say, that they might not watch season 5 until Winds of Winter is published. I would rather like to read first and see it in the show afterwards myself, but I do love the show very much (not as much as the books though), so I will keep watching and be amazed.
Â 
Oh - and there are even some things, I like more in the show - especially some characters: I never liked Oberyn Martell in the book - he never seemed that interesting to me (despite being a House Martell fan), but I like him in the show very much, the actor really brings that character to live. Same with Osha, MIssandei and some other characters.

Â 
The difference is that if I'd known there would be spoilers in season 4 I could have chosen not to watch it. As you say, we were going to be getting spoilers in the next season. So I expected I would have to make a choice about whether to watch season 5 and get spoilers. I didn't get that choice for season 4.
Â 
I know the TWOW publication date is 2015 at the earliest. That leaves the tiny sliver of hope that it could be published before the next season. Or that further sample chapters will be released that contain what would be the TWOW show spoilers. If there is no hope that it could be published before the next season then it would be kinder for GRRM to let fans know than leave them in false hope.

The problem is that you think that the show follows the book storyline, when we've seen that the it hasn't since season 2.  It was ALWAYS possible for the show to go past the books, no matter which season it is or what the main storylines are.  Stannis meets with the banker of Braavos next week, something that happens in the 6th book but works better right now before Stannis takes off.  It is what it is, but you can't say "if I'd have known" because it was always a possibility.
4547	Sigrunn	2014-05-06	Why are you even watching the show if being spoiled means so much to you? Why not just wait for the books, then once you read them all after they're eventually released, go back and watch the show, and compare the two?

Â 
There is no way of avoiding spoilers unless you mean to build a bunker. Say, nobody cares that the Night's King is alive and was shown in the show before he appeared in the books. However, if a character of great importance (Dany, Arya) dies, the media will be filled with it. Many heard of the Red Wedding and they never saw the show.
4548	Corona Radiata	2014-05-06	Jerome Flynn was credited for this episode despite the fact that Bronn is nowhere to be found.Â The only scene where Bronn could have appeared is in the beginning at Tommon's coronation. I've looked but I don't see him. And when you think about it, it really doesn't make sense for Bronn to be there anyways. Am I missing something?On the other hand, Conleth Hill is not credited even though Varys is in the episode. I'm guessing whoever does the credits accidently put Flynn instead of Hill. Have they ever messed up the credits before? Season 4 is the first that I'm watching as it airs.
4549	Kaspiro	2014-05-04	In the books, Sandor is left to die after being wounded at a tavern fight, one which happened without any tangible consequences for him in the books already. I imagine that their are two ways Sandor's storyline could continue now: he does not 'die' at all (which I find possible but unlikely, given it completely eliminates Sandor's 'redemption'), or that the show creates a new death for him (akin to Rakharo's new death in the Red Waste). Thinking of potential new 'deaths' for Sandor, I can't help remembering that Sandor is currently journeying to ransom Arya to Lysa Arryn in the Eyrie. Though he definitely won't be making this transaction, to get to the Eyrie he would have to travel through the Mountains of the Moon. Now, I'm sure many in the show-only audience still recall the unique and somewhat comical mountain clans from Seasons 1 and 2. I don't think, at this point, re-introducing them would be particularly difficult. So my prediction is: Sandor and Arya travel through the Mountains of the Moon, and meet with Shagga and his Stone Crows or some other clan chief and clan. Sandor is unable or unwilling to negotiate with them and wins the fight against them but is wounded. Arya leaves him to 'die', as before, and the story continues on as normal. Arya could easily travel to some Vale town (perhaps Gulltown, even) to get on a ship to Braavos, and Sandor could plausibly make his way to the Quiet Isle from the Vale. It would be a fairly good opportunity to bring some well-liked characters (I'm sure more than a few people wouldn't be adverse to seeing Shagga again), and stay consistent with the storyline. Thoughts?Â
4550	Jennelyn	2014-05-04	Since we see Arya stabbing the Hound in the preview for the next episode, I'm guessing she is the one responsible for his eventually fatal wound. It's hard to say from 1 second of footage, but it would be an elegant way for them to part.
Â 
Your theory is interesting, but I'm doubtful that they will spend so much time on that storyline. Whatever happens, my guess is that the Hound's days are numbered and he won't appear on many more episodes this season.
4551	MsLibby	2014-05-04	If he appears at all. In this season or next!Â  I've doubted if we'll see the Quiet Isles scene at all.
4552	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-04	He and Arya reach the Vale, but are barred from entering the Eyrie by the Vale knights at the Bloody Gate. Either Sandor gets into a brawl with them and is wounded there or he turns around and is attacked by mountain clansmen and is wounded by them.
Â 
Probably the former since the CV of the actor playing the Knight of the Gate has his appearance scheduled for an Alex Graves episode.
Â 
I think the theory of Arya doing it with her stab move in episode five is stupid.
4553	King Tommen	2014-05-04	I don't think Arya does any damage at all with that poke, it looks like she ends up on her ass as a result. The Hound's wound will come from a fight near the end of the season. I'm doubtful it's with any of the Hill tribes though because none of them have been announced as returning.
Â 
One interesting development is that Brienne/Pod and Arya/Hound are on a collision course going to the Vale for the end of the season. They may or may not actually meet up but both duos will certainly be in the same vicinity around the same time.
4554	Obebb	2014-05-04	I like OPs theory about the Vale. It seems way more likely for the show to stick with what the audience already knows rather than introducing a whole new place (the Quiet Isle). And I think a battle with the Hound vs Mountain Clans could be very exciting! I'd love to see Shagga againÂ  Â although having him "kill" the Hound would probably turn everyone in the fandom against himÂ  Â So a random clansman would be better. I'd like that.
4555	Jennelyn	2014-05-04	You're probably right that Arya doesn't actually stab the Hound. I'm sure they just want to make folks wonder by what they showed in the preview. If they do indeed reach the Eyrie, it makes sense that he's wounded there somehow. However, I don't think Arya wounding the Hound is a stupid theory. He is on her list, after all. I don't care how buddy buddy they've been.
4556	Bran Snow	2014-05-04	I don't think Arya does any damage at all with that poke, it looks like she ends up on her ass as a result. The Hound's wound will come from a fight near the end of the season. I'm doubtful it's with any of the Hill tribes though because none of them have been announced as returning.
Â 
One interesting development is that Brienne/Pod and Arya/Hound are on a collision course going to the Vale for the end of the season. They may or may not actually meet up but both duos will certainly be in the same vicinity around the same time.


Â 
I agree
Â 
I think what we are seeing is Arya showing off her Bravosi sword skills and the Hound just laughs at her

4557	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-04	Some say Brienne has to meet LSH as her season conclusion since she departed so early, but I think barely missing Arya will be just fine.
4558	Laniki	2014-05-04	Perhaps Sandor does get wounded and goes back to the farmer and his daughter to recover. After he recovers, Sandor takes up the farmers offer to help out.
4559	Jslay427	2014-05-04	Aryas stab never punctured his mail, so it's very possible his wound is received in the vale.
4560	Chebyshov	2014-05-04	Aryas stab never punctured his mail, so it's very possible his wound is received in the vale.

Agreed. I guarantee he's going to die as close to the Eyrie as possible so we can get another Stark children reunion tease.
4561	Kaspiro	2014-05-04	Aryas stab never punctured his mail, so it's very possible his wound is received in the vale.


Â 
I was just about to post that Arya did not in fact end up killing him this episode, so his fate is still open to speculation.Â 
Â

Â 
It isÂ starting toÂ seem like the writers are fond of getting our hopes up for Stark reunions, with Arya and Sandor at the Red Wedding and Jon and Bran this episode. I would definitely expect them to do it again if they aren't stopped before reaching the Vale, even if most viewers have lost faith in it happening.Â 
Â 
Though the mention of Beric and Thoros of Myr did make me think. If he doesn't die in the Vale, is there any chance of Sandor running into the Brotherhood Without Banners again? I'm leaning towards 'no', because that seems like a scene Brienne and Pod are being set up for, but who knows.

Â I don't think Sandor would go back and grovel in front of a man he robbed. My guess is either he gets a wound from a fight along the road to the Eyrie, or Arya does it herself at some point. The fact that they made a point of highlighting The Hound's name in Arya's list of future kills could have been a bit of foreshadowing that his 'death' will be more directly caused by her, rather than just helped along by her neglect.
4563	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-05-05	Perhaps Sandor does get wounded and goes back to the farmer and his daughter to recover. After he recovers, Sandor takes up the farmers offer to help out.


Â 
I actually think that would be a great reveal in a season or two after The Hound "dies." Â A few bandits swing by the farmer and The Hound opens the front door, sending the bandits on their way. Â WHAT??? Â He's ALIVE??? Â The Internet EXPLODES!
4564	Seneti	2014-05-05	He and Arya reach the Vale, but are barred from entering the Eyrie by the Vale knights at the Bloody Gate. Either Sandor gets into a brawl with them and is wounded there or he turns around and is attacked by mountain clansmen and is wounded by them.


Â 
Probably this.
4565	Envie	2014-05-05	Well they pointedly (har har pun intended) showed us twice this episode that Arya wants him dead both by letting him know he's in her 'list' and by trying to stick him with needle. I think that's a fairly obvious indication they want the audience to believe Arya's going to kill him - but she probably won't. This was all done to work show fans up a bit. More than likely he'll get injured one of the ways people have already guessed at and then it will still go on as in the books. Arya might even feel a twinge of remorse.
4566	salmonsnake	2014-05-05	He and Arya reach the Vale, but are barred from entering the Eyrie by the Vale knights at the Bloody Gate. Either Sandor gets into a brawl with them and is wounded there or he turns around and is attacked by mountain clansmen and is wounded by them.Might even be both, since Rory said in an interview that The Hound has 3-4 big fight scenes this season, and we've only seen one.
4567	veto	2014-05-05	depending on sandors role in the rest of the story , i cant see him being gone for too long .
if he does appear again in the books , the shows writers will want to keep the character going and only out of mind for a few episodes rather than a season .
4568	RavenKing23	2014-05-05	Is it just me or do they seem to be building another brother showdown? Maybe they get a 2nd fight where Sandor is wounded and a 3rd tie breaker with Robert Strong

4576	Colonel Green	2014-05-05	I was thinking that the Hound would get into a fight at the Bloody Gate (which basically seems to have replaced the Gates of the Moon on the show), but on Sansa and Littlefinger's walk-through there were dozens of guys there, including cliff archers.Â  I can't imagine the Hound being dumb enough to start a fight there, and if he did, I have no idea how he could possibly get away (particularly as this stuff was filmed in Iceland where there are no horses allowed).

Â 
I think that's the most likely option, with Arya doing the deed herself a somewhat distant second. Not sure who he'll be fighting though. The tribesmen do seem an option, as others have said. That said, Arya does have to choose to leave him to die, unless they change that too. Her stabbing the Hound herself would remove the need a tricky farewell conversation!

Â 
Is that true about the horses? Do you just mean in terms of filming or budgeting or something? I recall seeing some dead horses at the Fist of the First Men. Not sure about any live ones though!
Â 
Where do they film the Haunted Forest scenes? I think a trailer showed some of Stannis' men on horseback. It would be pretty lame if there was no major mounted charge as part of the assault. I guess that might be Ireland or somewhere.

Iceland doesn't allow the importation of foreign horses because of the health of their native breed, a rather smallish type that are not the kind the show has been using for filming thus far.
Â 
The Haunted Forest stuff is filmed on sets in Ireland.
4579	Le Cygne	2014-05-05	Thought this was interesting, seeing it again (he only hit her in the books to save her life, I was wondering why they did that):
Â 
In the Riverlands, Sandor Clegane (Rory McCann) knows that Arya (Maise Williams) dreams of killing him. But when he finds her practicing her needlework, he gives her a lesson in what she needs to survive. The slap Sandor lays across Aryas face as she pushes Needle helplessly up against his mail is less a way to put her in her place, and more a means of marking her as an equal. Like Bronn did with Jaime, the blow is less of contempt, and more a sign Sandor thinks Arya can be educated.

4580	JDNight	2014-05-05	I have to agree with some of the others above, The Hound is slowly becoming my favorite character.Â  Yes, please do not kill him.Â  Just make him go away and do a spin off or something.Â  It could haveÂ him running around and telling people that heÂ doesn't have to do what they tell him.Â  And when they disagree and try to force him, he just hacks them about for a bit until they stop moving.

His lines lately have made me smile soooo much.

mmm maybe, yes, in a more subtle way Â  However, in the show he's got a couple of scenes that make it very clear! Â
4590	WinterisAlwaysComing	2014-05-06	Exhibit A: Episode 404: Rast taunts Ghost verbally and with water just out of reach.
Exhibit B: Episode 405: Rast is no longer on this earth.
4591	iheartseverus	2014-05-02	So, we now know that the 'violent and disgusting' scene that had to be toned down, discussed by the Director of Photography, was not in episode 4, so its more than likely its coming up in episode 5.Â  My guess is that it will involve Ghost and Summer tearing mutineers limb from limb, but who knows!
Â 
Plus, we should be getting some stills from episode 5, probably later today and its always fun to see what we can glean from the photos.
Â 
Here is the recap (previously on) clip that was released yesterday--and it pretty much gives us a good indication of what's coming up in episode 5.

Â 
Discuss!
4592	Bungholes First	2014-05-05	Where did all the replies go to? I was hoping to discuss the graphic scene that was cut.
Â 
The whole Craster's Keep storyline was a let down and in the end just filler. And, while the action scenes were done well, all the vile actions we were shown committed by the mutineers and Locke we concluded with:
Â 
1. Two quick deaths for Karl and Locke.
2. One off screen death for Rast.
Â 
When it's let known to the press that a scene had to be toned down because it was too "violent and disgusting" the audience wants it to deliver.
Â 
I have more to say, but I also have a headache. TBC...
4593	Justin Danford	2014-05-05	What was the scene?
4594	Cold Crashing Waves	2014-05-05	Jon stabbing Karl is the only one that comes to mind. It was already pretty gruesome
Â 
I don't think it was Ghost mauling Rast as that wasn't 'toned down' it just wasn't shown at all. Plus, budget constraints. They aren't going to blow their CGI cash for the death of some minor asshole like Rast.
4595	Miodrag	2014-05-05	They aren't going to blow their CGI cash for the death of some minor asshole like Rast.


Â 
Not the cash, no. Screen-time, on the other hand? Yeah, they never hesitate to waste some screen-time on minor assholes like... well, basically like everyone from Karl's retinue, Karl included. Oh, and Lock.
4596	sati	2014-05-05	I think it was the shot of Snow with Longclaw going through Karl's mouth. Awesome shot btw.
4597	~No One~	2014-05-05	I think it was the shot of Snow with Longclaw going through Karl's mouth. Awesome shot btw.

I agree. It was hard to watch, for sure.

4599	Hielo y Fuego	2014-05-05	Could it be Bran-warged Hodor tearing Locke to pieces, the way that the Mountain did with Vargo in the books?

Now, that would've been pretty gruesome, IMO.

Ooohhhoo ouch okay yeah it could be worse for sure!
4602	Dragon's Bane	2014-05-05	imagine if Jon wrenched Longclaw upwards after impaling


Just twisting would be enough. But yeah, that scene was too gruesome for me.
4603	Ankou	2014-05-05	imagine if Jon wrenched Longclaw upwards after impaling


Jon isn't the Hulk. What would have been super gruesome is showing the effect on his teeth and brain leaking out of his mouth, which would be the case realistically.Â
4604	Nyrhex	2014-05-05	I'm pretty sure that it's Brienne and Biter. Gendry shoved a sword through Biter's mouth in the exact same way that Jon killed Karl. Since the show runners have already changed Tyrion's loss of nose for facial scar, Brienne is also likely to only get something superficial. Biter is forgotton, but his death in the books was too good to pass out on, so they gave Jon Gendry's badass kill.
4605	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-05	I think it was the shot of Snow with Longclaw going through Karl's mouth. Awesome shot btw.


Â 
I thought the withdrawal was well done, but the FX from the front view wasn't up to standard. The sword was the only thing out of focus in the whole scene. You don't get two areas in focus with the middle depth-of-field out of focus.
4606	Stone Cold Bastard	2014-05-05	Could it be Bran-warged Hodor tearing Locke to pieces, the way that the Mountain did with Vargo in the books?
Â 
Now, that would've been pretty gruesome, IMO.

Probably, great call.
I recall the camera cutting away and hearing Locke screaming in absolute agony. Seeing it would be horrific.

Good catch. I don't remember seeing that, but I do recall someone (Gren, I think) asking Jon "what could've done that to a man?" or something along those lines. And then, they all look down at Locke's face, which is one bloody mess.
Â 
So, yeah, I definitely think it's very possible that this was it.

Eh, just watched it again.

Don't think it was Locke's death. No camera panning away. You see everything, and it's very quick. Locke is choking, and then Hodor snaps his neck.
Perhaps it was Karl getting Longclaw through his head, or the disturbing sexual assault scenes in Craster's Keep from episode 4.

Yeah I got the same impression watching that scene. I guess there's wasn't gonna be a Gendry in the Brienne/Biter scene as he is on his way via Edric Storms journey to God-knows-where, so they had to put that awesome kill somewhere else. Unless Pod gets to have two stabby-through-the-back-of-head moments.

4626	Alysanne Snow	2014-05-05	What did everyone think of Dany deciding to stay rather than being forced into it?
Â 
Personally, I like it. Â I know readers are always complaining about Cersei's agency being taken away and this call gives a little bit more to Dany, without taking her wildly out of character. Â Her choice is pretty consistent with both her book and show character, as she is someone who likes taking responsibility for everything and places her morals above reason.
Â 
It also begins introducing some more grey (at about the same point Dany got less white in the books, IIRC). Â On the one hand, she is trying to stay and fix the mistakes she's made. Â On the other hand, she is a foreign ruler with no understanding of the lands or the people she is trying to control and we're already seeing the fallout from her poorly thought out attempts to "fix" the culture. Â Dany's backed herself into a corner. Â It's nice to see her realizing this and choosing not to abandon Essos, although a bit more remorse and less "look at me be a queen" would have been nice. Â Also hopefully the Unsullied are going to start wonder how she will really fare as queen of Westeros, another land she's never actually seen. Â She actually reminds me of Robert, ironically, in that she makes a much better conqueror than she does a rule and would likely leave a succession crisis in her wake, at least in the books. Â Really do hope that translates to TV
Â 
I also hope, though, that we're not stuck in Meereen for a season and a half. Â I want to see the blunders along the way but if she's not moving past ADWD in season 5, her screentime needs to be cut as I see no reason it can't be cut down to the highlights.
4627	Tyrion1991	2014-05-05	Next season we will get the Battle of Meereen and see her leave but thats still 2 seasons dedicated to Meereen.
Â 
Â 
Yeah they portray it as being a much more honorable choice and she took learning about Astapor n Yunkai much better than in the books. Also, I think those 93 ships, which I think may get ignored or set on fire later on as its too much of a plot gift, rather than giving a geographical reason such as the demon road definitely conveys this.

So for all of us who felt like we were chewing on chalk through the books / Meereen drama, now the television viewers are going to have that same disappointing feeling and tiresome chalk chewing I guess... they're going to have to stretch out the Meereen soap opera for the rest of this season and at least part of next season. Blargh. This is exactly where I got tired of Dany's story in the books and it seems like they're going to keep it spot on the same for the show.
Â 
Yeah yeah I know, she has to 'learn' how to be a Queen and 'learn' from her mistakes, and 'learn' how to control her dragons. Seriously though, all WE learned in the books was how godawful boring and contrived it all got.
4629	Red Tiger	2014-05-05	It gives us a chance to see if the Mad King's daughter dances close to madness. Im for it.

They don't have a choice. All the other characters are still in ASOS material for the most part. They cannot fast forward into Winds material and skip ADWD filler without hacking off GRRM.Â

Â 
Â 
It's true, you're correct. They pretty much have to go through the Meereen grind for Dany at this point. At least we have her affair with Han Solo Dhaario to look forward to ---Â
4632	Annara Snow	2014-05-05	What did everyone think of Dany deciding to stay rather than being forced into it?
Â 

She wasn't forced into it in the book, either, so I'm not sure what you mean.
4633	boojam	2014-05-05	What did everyone think of Dany deciding to stay rather than being forced into it?Â Personally, I like it. Â I know readers are always complaining about Cersei's agency being taken away and this call gives a little bit more to Dany, without taking her wildly out of character. Â Her choice is pretty consistent with both her book and show character, as she is someone who likes taking responsibility for everything and places her morals above reason.Â It also begins introducing some more grey (at about the same point Dany got less white in the books, IIRC). Â On the one hand, she is trying to stay and fix the mistakes she's made. Â On the other hand, she is a foreign ruler with no understanding of the lands or the people she is trying to control and we're already seeing the fallout from her poorly thought out attempts to "fix" the culture. Â Dany's backed herself into a corner. Â It's nice to see her realizing this and choosing not to abandon Essos, although a bit more remorse and less "look at me be a queen" would have been nice. Â Also hopefully the Unsullied are going to start wonder how she will really fare as queen of Westeros, another land she's never actually seen. Â She actually reminds me of Robert, ironically, in that she makes a much better conqueror than she does a rule and would likely leave a succession crisis in her wake, at least in the books. Â Really do hope that translates to TVÂ I also hope, though, that we're not stuck in Meereen for a season and a half. Â I want to see the blunders along the way but if she's not moving past ADWD in season 5, her screentime needs to be cut as I see no reason it can't be cut down to the highlights.I liked Jorah noting that 10,000 men could take KL but not Westeros.Selmy pointed out there were plenty of 'royalists' who could come to her side.GRRM even says this in the books, but then never elaborates.How many royalists?Who, maybe Dorne... who else?Never clear.I notice that, even tho they should know the story well, neither Jorah or Selmy mention Aegon the Conqueror pretty much did it with three huge dragons and god-only-knows how large an army...apparently small.... (maybe we will find out October 28 this year?)?I can't remember in the books if Dany, Jorah and Selmy talk about letting the dragons grow, finding a 'dragoner' to make them War Dragons ... then you are all set!As far as I know there is no conversation about Aegon with Dany at all , at this point.

4634	AZAXD	2014-05-05	I like that she made her decision just after she's weighing up the idea of heading to Westeros. Personally when I read that she was staying in Meereen I was disappointed (I was all like NOOO GET THOSE DRAGONS AND TEAR IT UP GIRL) and her lengthy stay there really took its toll on me and I want it to be the same in the show. (I should add that I don't think I fully appreciated Feast and Dance and need to reread them).
I hate the idea of the TV fans getting this like super hero Dany that is consistently awesome, us having read what we've read. Interestingly enough, two of my 'unsullied' friends both thought it was a great move on Dany's part.
4635	El Guapo	2014-05-05	Does anyone else think that now that Dany has enough ships on her own (Mereen's Navy of 93 ships), the Iron Fleet coming to Dany is not needed?Â  This may be an indication that Victarion will be cut from the show.

Good catch.Â
4639	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-05-05	One interesting thing I noticed was what was an apparent post production edit when she was talking to Jorah. As she is speaking, the camera suddenly cuts to behind her but her jaw isn't moving as she speaks the first line, but then moves as she says the second.
Â 
It is when she says "... if I can't rule Slaver's Bay."
Â 
I am certain the line in one of the Trailers was "... if I can't rule a city." I checked and Trailer No2 has been taken down from the Game Of Thrones channel.
Â 
I also felt it a bit irksome when she says "My liberation of Slaver's Bay....". Combined with the (apparent) change above and the mention of the 'council she left to rule in Astapor', it makes it appear that her plan since Astapor was to 'liberate' and 'rule' Slaver's Bay. Perhaps this was something they forgot to mention in S3... like the forgetting to ever name the dragons thing.

Â 
Eh, I'm probably being overly critical of that story line through ADWD - I'm doing a re-read now so maybe I'll enjoy it better the second time around! I just remember getting a bit tired of how long it was dragging out and every twist and turn with the harpies, etc felt like another piece of drama to just distract and keep Dany from her true purpose. I was also really super annoyed with how she treated her dragons so that had to color my opinion of all this going into the show Meereen phase.Â 
Â 
I hope, for brevity sake they shorten a lot of that out of the show.

my friend...i feel our unsullied compadre should not get a pass on getting bored and annoyed out of their mind seeing GRRM's choices with Dany "oh i dont love anyone, but i must marry Hizdhar, but i wana bone Daario, but no i cant, im a queen, it would be wrong, but it would feel so good"Â  Â  
Â 
made me wana seriouslyÂ  Â  andÂ  Â  dany...and not even for the naughty reasons!Â 
Â 
i felt similarly on Bran's story line as well for a long time, D&D decided to spice things up there despite everyone's criticisms, i would have hated for them to stick to cannon for that story ("oh its cold, i wish i could walk, im hungry, my life sucks, its so cold, i wish i could walk, oh look im being attacked") so meereen...hopefully D&D change things up there as well, maybe introduce some long awaited characters like shavepate...though im sure it would still annoy everyone (both sullied and unsullied)Â

Â 
Thanks, I will give that a read. One of the reasons I'm doing a re-read of ADWD is because after the split with the previous book I got confused. At the point where it went from two sides of the same story (parallel timeline) to becoming one merged sequential timeline again, I think I got lost and confused. I have twice now made timeline errors in replying to someone so I think a re-read is in order. It helps too that the show is now touching into ADWD territory anyways.

It's true - Dany's story (and to some extent Bran and Jon's) did go through some annoying phases which were purposely done to antagonize the reader I'm sure. None of that would translate well to the show because we don't have the POV perspective of the characters to back up a lot of those internal conflicts, feelings and experiences. In fact I think the lack of good internal POV dialogue is one of the main reasons the show suffers a bit in many areas.
Â 
I guess I'm ok with them dragging out the Meereen story so that viewers get frustrated. They certainly trolled the show fans enough by several times hinting about dragons flying over King's Landing and then going into the logistics of her actually going over the narrow sea ... a lot of buildup to bring them all crashing down at the end of her scene where she calmly announces she's decided to stay in Meereen and rule. Yuck. I too wanted her to advance faster in the books and that's why I'm trying to re-read the book and slow down to better appreciate why GRRM wrote it the way he did.

Â 
agreed with all of it...i remember worrying about Arya's endless travels as well, i was really hoping for her warging scenes but ended up even more disappointed...though the Tywin/Arya scene did have their merit...
Â 
i was thinking the same thing, i will re-read, much more patiently and slowly both books 4 and 5
4645	Dragon's Bane	2014-05-05	I think it's really nice to paint the poor little crippled boy Bran in a darker shade of grey, when we learn from Varamyr, that warging into people is a bad thing. In the show, not even little grandfather Jojen seems to mind that Hodor's rights as an individual get violated and he is practically soul-raped. Am I the only one who sees that as a quite severe deviation from the books, as it is not so much about the story as it is about characters?
4646	Tyrion1991	2014-05-05	That is a colossal change from the novels.
Â 
In the books whatever navy the Meereenese might have had was able to escape and is currently fighting Dany.
Â 
Her lack of ships is a huge problem and is precisely why most people believe that the Iron Fleet is being sent to her with, oddly enough, a similar round number of a 100 ships; though they actually lose half the fighting ones and never get back the full number so its more like 70.7
Â 
Have they just cut Victarion Greyjoy and the whole Ironborn going east?
Â 
There doesn't seem to be any practical reason to give Dany ships in some other fashion this early.
Â 
Never mind that it would completely change the dynamic of the battle of Meereen. Its hard to imagine the slavers being able to force an entry.
Â 
Â 
Also..."sailing down the Blackwater and storming the gates". Â Wonder who tried and failed to o that recently. Barristan was really made out as quite naive and not wise at this meeting. Â
4647	14ccKemistk	2014-05-02	Since the Episode 4 recap is now out, we get a lot of hints of what to expect from Episode 5. I guess this can warrant it's own thread.http://youtu.be/hzOwdkUU5Mo
Some of the more interesting bits, not previously indicated by the preview, would be:
- Myrcella being sent off to Dorne. Does this mean we will see some of Dorne for the first time?
- Bran warging into Hodor clearly indicates that he will use this ability to help them escape Craster's.
- Yet another reminder of Catelyn also hints that Lady Stoneheart will appear soon?
- The Loras/Cersei marriage pact resolution. How will it be stopped?
4648	King Tommen	2014-05-04	I believe the Catelyn and Ned scene is to remind the audience about Lysa's letter to them accusing the Lannisters of being behind Jon Arryn's murder which more or less started the whole Stark/Lannister conflict. This episode will definitely revisit that plot development with Petyr and Lysa.
Â 
The shot of Myrcella being sent to Dorne is most likely because Oberyn and Cersei are having a conversation this episode and Myrcella being held hostage in Dorne will be brought up there. We won't be seeing Dorne this season as no other Dornish characters have been cast outside of Oberyn and Ellaria.
4649	Obebb	2014-05-04	Bran warging Hodor will be cool but if Meera doesn't help out too I'll be real angryÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â
4650	King Tommen	2014-05-04	Meera's got herself some Dragonglass arrowheads (courtesy of Sam). I think she'll be instrumental later in the season when they have a certain WW encounter even if she doesn't save the day in this episode.

4651	Lord Damian	2014-05-04	Well, the scene is over, to non book readers. Lysa confessed to Jon Arryn's murder so Littlefinger has been outed as the main spark in what caused the war (other than Cersei and Jaime's twincest ofcourse).
4652	JesterX	2014-05-04	WellÂ it WASÂ pissing me off that the show is deviating so much from the books but I think I get it now.Â  It took me five episodes into this season to realize what the show is trying to do.Â  They're clearly trying to NOTÂ catch up to the books.Â  That's why they're going off on all these tangents with stuff like going after the mutineers at Crater's keep, and why the Hound and Arya are still togetherÂ and in next week's preview we saw Stannis at the Iron Bank.Â  They're doing the equivalent of a jet in a holding pattern before landing back into the events and storylinesÂ of the books.
Â 
In light of that, I'm less pissed off because now I think they're actually trying to RESPECT the books.

4660	ebevan91	2014-04-27	Wow, good job on the mod/admin who approved this thread just hours after the episode, ended, and not like 3 days before the episode.
4661	Ser Blake	2014-04-27	Looks like a lot will be going down in the Eyrie. Â With Sansa crying and Petyr and Lysa standing by the moon door, I'm kind of worried Only Cat could come a bit quicker than we were expecting.
4662	Gonzalo	2014-04-27	Considering that we will see Lady Anya Waynwood and Bronze Yohn Royce this season, it means we will get either the wedding or even "Only Cat" and then some Lords Declarant goodness.
4663	Le Cygne	2014-04-27	I think - and this is just a guess, no idea what's happening with this story anymore - the Arya and the Hound scene was her showing him her way of sword fighting (Syrio's way) and he's saying his way is better.
4664	Colonel Green	2014-04-27	Looks like a lot will be going down in the Eyrie. Â With Sansa crying and Petyr and Lysa standing by the moon door, I'm kind of worried Only Cat could come a bit quicker than we were expecting.


That's Sansa crying against Lysa's chest, in what looks like the same scene where they sit down and talk.Â  I imagine this'll be Lysa acting like a quasi-decent relation before it becomes clear she's a nut.
Â 
Kind of surprised at getting to the Eyrie this quickly.Â  It seemed from reports that Robin isn't appearing until episode 7, so it's a weird choice to not have him there when they get to the Eyrie initially.
4665	booknerd2	2014-04-27	Too excited that crazy Lysa is back!
Â 
Dickie did a great job in season 1 and I can't wait to see her smother LF with attention. lol!
Â 
And I will take any Arya and Hound scenes.Â
4666	Newstar	2014-04-27	There were reports that Aidan Gillen and Sophie Turner filmed in Iceland. I know some were speculating that that meant that Littlefinger and Sansa would be making a stopover at the Fingers, but it looks like the promo put paid to that notion...or else the stopover will be an exceedingly short one.
Â 
Looking forward to Lysa's (and the Eyrie's) return.
4667	Talbot	2014-04-27	The melee at Crasters should be pretty cool.
Â 
I think Jon will kill Karl. Probably will put his sword through his face.
Â 
Hopefully Ghost kills Rast.
4668	Colonel Green	2014-04-27	There were reports that Aidan Gillen and Sophie Turner filmed in Iceland. I know some were speculating that that meant that Littlefinger and Sansa would be making a stopover at the Fingers, but it looks like the promo put paid to that notion...or else the stopover will be an exceedingly short one.


You can see at least one exterior shot there.Â  So it seems like it's just going to be them approaching the Eyrie.
4669	Konradsmith	2014-04-28	I love that this promo thread was approved so quickly! Last week we had to wait till Thursday. Great episode four and I'm looking forward to this next one all the more.
Â 
Ghost killing Rast would be nice, given that Ghost menaced Rast back in ep. 104 (it's nice to have Cogman harkening back to his own episodes).
4670	Tyrion1991	2014-04-28	Looks like they're portraying Dany as being over confident with her victory over the slavers.
Â 
The idea of her taking Kings Landing like she took Meereen is nonsense and it looks like the scene will be a "back down to earth moment".
Â 
Probably where they point out that she only has 8000 unsullied and 2000 mercenaries. Tywin alone has 60,000.Â 
Â 
I REALLY hope the discussion leads to talk of which houses Dany could ally with (obviously relevant for the Dornish story). This could even mean that we finally get the scene where her lack of understanding about her father the mad king and her scewed view of the starks comes into play.
Â 
Still, super annoyed by the continuing fan fic with Jorah still being in Meereen. Does nothing for the show and a waste of time. ADWD should be their only focus and not a character whose book material they cut out in its entirity.
4671	Seneti	2014-04-28	My thoughts on the promo:
Â 
1) Looks like we'll get lots of Craster's and lots of the Eyrie. I don't think we'll get "Only Cat" just yet and I think Bran and Co. will either escape in the middle of the fighting without having a chance to meet Jon or Locke will try to kill them, making Jon realize that they are as safe north of the wall as they would be south of it.
Â 
2) Cersei walking between Margaery and Tommen really has me pumped for the rivalry between her and "the younger queen".
Â 
3) Dany talking about going to Westeros - excellent trolling, D&D!
Â

3) Dany talking about going to Westeros - excellent trolling, D&D!


Â 
They're letting people down slowly. All the while shes talking about Westeros she is staying in Meereen. Its like getting a horse used to you with gentle touches, slowly winning its trust...
4674	intheswamp	2014-04-28	Everything is coming up Tommen:Â  the throne, the girl, Sir Pounce...Â
4675	King Tommen	2014-04-28	There's no way that Tommen didn't rub one out after Margaery left the room.
4676	King Tommen	2014-04-28	any chance that Ayra 'sticking the Hound with the pointy end' could cause the festering wound that kills him?


Â 
That seems unlikely. Too soon for that and it didn't even look like it pierced his armor.
4677	Father of Dragons	2014-04-28	The "Only Cat" scene, if it does not happen in the finale, will most likely be in episode 7 or 8. They wouldn't have it as soon as they arrive. 
My only concern is that they'll just give away the fact that Lysa poisioned Jon. She says "What wife would do for you what I've done for you?"
I assume she'll be saying this when it's just her and Littlefinger and not in front of anyone, so it'll be like a Varys/Littlefinger conversation, or a Margaery/Olenna one like last episode.
As Colonel Green said, Robin will appear on episode 7, and it seems wrong to have scenes with him without his mother in at least one.
This makes me sound skeptical, but no matter what happens, I'm really looking forward to the Eyrie scenes
4678	Mel_Rose	2014-04-28	Looks like they're portraying Dany as being over confident with her victory over the slavers.
Â 
The idea of her taking Kings Landing like she took Meereen is nonsense and it looks like the scene will be a "back down to earth moment".
Â 
Probably where they point out that she only has 8000 unsullied and 2000 mercenaries. Tywin alone has 60,000.Â 
Â 


Â 
I agree. I like how they are going to touch on the subject of her returning to Westeros. Viewers think that it's a matter of time before she lands on King's Landing, so it really helps if the show makes it crystal clear how difficult that is - not a large enough army, or ships and perhaps uncertain alliances.
Â 
Cersei vs Margaery is already being set up nicely, am looking forward to it.
Â 
Also, can't wait for crazy Lysa. Don't think the 'only Cat' moment will come this early, it's just the moon door is a prominent feature of the set. They have to have the ice castle scene first, also show how she becomes jealous. Trying to murder Sansa, only to be herself thrown out the moon door sounds like a finale moment to me.
Â 
EDIT: Also it's great that Daenerys is finally wearing something other than the blue dress.

I don't think they'll reveal the Jon poisoning yet... especially since most of the Unsullied would need to be first reminded about his death and how it all started the Stark/Lannister conflict. But it makes sense to establish the relationship and history between Lysa and LF in scenes between the two of them over the next several epsiodes, instead of having it all come out in two big infodumps from Lysa to Sansa, as it does in the book.

4680	Queen of Whores	2014-04-28	There's no way that Tommen didn't rub one out after Margaery left the room.


Â 
I was half expecting the scene to end with him awkwardly reaching down below under the blankets.
Â 
Btw, just how old is Tommen supposed to be in-show? The actor looks like's he's about fifteen, but the last time we saw Tommen on the show he couldn't have been older than ten. Are we supposed to believe the Tommen in the show right now is about 12 or 13? I'm somewhat confused on this matter.
4681	salmonsnake	2014-04-28	What I get from this promo is that Bran and Jon are likely to not meet. They use the distraction of the NW attack as an opportunity to flee. I think Jojen's line might mean that he fears Jon might try to stop them if they lingered.
4682	Dany's Silver	2014-04-28	Â 
That seems unlikely. Too soon for that and it didn't even look like it pierced his armor.


Â 
When I saw that I was reminded of Jorah teaching Rakharo about how a broadsword is perfect for piercing armour.Â  Jorah looked pained in the promo, and I wonder if we'll see him leaving for Volantis soon.Â  But given the changes to his character in the show, I wonder how they'll accomplish his split with Dany....
4683	Arkash	2014-04-28	There's no way that Tommen didn't rub one out after Margaery left the room.


Â 
I actually did wonder if something more was gonna happen during the scene ! Imo, show-Tommen is old enough to have sexual desire and come on... what straight man wouldnt do Margaery Tyrell ? ^^
I hope the show explores the eventuality of Tommen's birth of sexual desire towards his queen in the show ! Would be a nice touch !
4684	salmonsnake	2014-04-28	^^ They first need to introduce some discord between Jorah and Barristan, hitherto they've been best bros
Â 
Re. Tommen, yeah I think they're going with very early adolescence, it's not a bad change IMO

4685	King Tommen	2014-04-28	If Tommen is just around the start of his sexual puberty, then it's not going to be difficult to show how Margaery can quickly become so influential with him. Look at that nod and smile when she asked him if she could come back again. Cersei doesn't stand a chance...
Â 
Looks like his coronation is next episode and the synopsis says that Tywin and Cersei plot the Crown's next move so undoubtedly, the Margaery pact is sealed here much to Cersei's chagrin. They might also deal with the Loras engagement and eventual inclusion in the Kingsguard. If not now, then you probably won't see that touched on until S5 after Tywin's gone.
Â 
I think Dany making it clear what she still needs to do before she can leave for Westeros is incredibly important. There should be some definitive milestone put out there (double the size of her army, get a certain number of allies, build x number of ships, have the dragons grow to a certain size etc) that tells the audience that she can't go yet. You can't just have her say "You know what? I feel obligated to stay and rule here indefinitely because it's my responsibility" because that's the kind of thing that pissed off everyone reading the book.
4686	Starkfyre Barathyrell	2014-04-28	it's funny how the included dany asking if 8000 unsullied and 2000 second sons is enough to take kings landing, when the next line is probably barristan saying no
4687	Runaway Bunny	2014-04-28	Could Sansa crying be after the attempted rape?
4688	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-04-28	I laughed so hard, both at the serious trolling to non-book readers with Dany and the first shot of crazy Lysa's face. Â Played that repeatedly. Â Ohh, the hype.
Â 
We'll get the Dany lines here of "I will do what queens do..I will rule." andÂ "How can I rule Seven Kingdoms, if I can't control a single city?" as she finds out about the messed up situations she left Qarth, Astapor, and Yunkai in.
Â 
Â 
"Only Cat" will beÂ for The Children. Â Lysa killed Jon to save Robin from being fostered away at Dragonstone.
4689	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-28	Looking forward to Jon confronting Karl and the mutineers. Would love for Ghost to escape and be the one to kill Karl, or Rast.
4690	Queen Sansa Stark	2014-04-28	Could Sansa crying be after the attempted rape?


Â 
I don't think it is. I think the reason why Sansa is crying at that moment is because they are talking about Catelyn being dead and that they only have each other now. Hence why Lysa comforts her. I like that scene, because for a moment you get the feeling that Sansa finally gets some peace. It will give the unsullied - just like it was for us once - a false sense of reliefÂ

Â 
I agree. Whenever they make a reveal about something on the show, they heavily reference it beforehand. You could have played a drinking game with the phrase "Iron Bank of Braavos" before Davos decides to write to them.
4692	tyrell19	2014-04-28	so excited for the return of Lysa. One of my favourite minor characters and Dickie was brilliant in season 1. Also glad that by the looks of the trailer we get to see her bipolar nature which was something they dint have to time to show in season 1
4693	benalapin	2014-04-28	"Only Cat" will happen in episode 7 definitely -- the title of that episode is Mockingbird, LF's sigil.Â 
Â 
I really like how it appears they're making Lysa look like what an aunt is supposed to be. They might instigate a pseudo-redemptive arc for her, but in the end she'll just turn out to be a nutter like in season 1. It follows the theme in the show where they make evil characters go on redemptive arcs before having them rape their sister in front of their incestuous bastard son's corpse :L
4694	aFeastForDragons	2014-04-28	"Would that be enough to take King's Landing?"
Â 
Hahahahahaâ<U+0080>¦.hahaâ<U+0080>¦hahaâ<U+0080>¦.haâ<U+0080>¦â<U+0080>¦ Â the unsullied will be heart broken
Â 
For a second I thought Arya stabbed the hound. That would have been a terrible deviation.
Â 
Night's Watch vs the Mutineers will be awesome
Â 
Hoepfully no more TWOW scenes.

Aegon conquered the seven kingdoms with like 3000 men and 3 dragons to start, so Dany's ahead of him at this point.
4696	TheBadboy	2014-04-28	Why are they starting the bitch battle between Marg and Cersei this early?
4697	Shitmouth the Wise	2014-04-28	any chance that Ayra 'sticking the Hound with the pointy end' could cause the festering wound that kills him?


Â 
That's my guess.Â  Also, I get the feeling that the farmer he robbed in the 3rd episode will be the one who takes him in in his post-"Hound" life.Â  That is, if they decide to keep him alive.Â  His character is essentially retired in the books (at least for the time being); will they keep an actor on when his role is so limited for the forseeable future?
4698	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-28	Aegon conquered the seven kingdoms with like 3000 men and 3 dragons to start, so Dany's ahead of him at this point.

4700	MarcusLloydAK	2014-04-28	I can't wait for Lysa and the Eyrie!!! I think Kate plays Lysa so well, and it'll be a shame if "only Cat" is in episode 7, albeit I think it will. I'd like it to be in ep 10 though, as the character is awesome!
4701	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-28	Why are they starting the bitch battle between Marg and Cersei this early?


Â 
It's not early.
4702	TheBadboy	2014-04-28	Â 
It's not early.

Ohh yes it is. 
It starts after Tywin's death when Cersei makes her own calls. 
But I am not complaining. Marg - Cersei fight is going to be the most interesting thing in KL!
4703	Carne	2014-04-28	We've seen photos of Maisie and Rory filming the preview scene. In them Maisie is lying flat on her back. I'm guessing she attemtps to stab the Hound, Needle doesn't penetrate his armor,Â  he gives her a smack and tell's her to stop fucking around.
Â 
Also, I really hope Hodor goes full Hulk mode. He looks really angry in the preview.

Â 
I'd estimate the chances at 0.000000000000000000000% aka zero.
Â 
There is, however, a chance that she manages to make a scratch in his armor, but I wouldn't bet on it.

Â 
The episode being named "Mockingbird" doesn't have to mean that Only Cat will be in it. It's probably an episode with LF's and Lysa's wedding, where we get to see more of the Vale people, get to see SR again (Lino Facioli is in the episode), learn more about LF's background through the interactions with Lysa and the Vale lords who are not fond of him, and hear some of his 'lessons' to Sansa.
Â 
I'd be extremely surprised if Only Cat is before the season finale, and even more so if it's in episode 4.7. D&D have said that the last three episodes are full of big, shocking moments - not the last four. (I'm willing to bet that the shocking moments in episode 8 include Arya leaving a wounded Sandor in addition to the Oberyn/Gregor fight.)

Episode 9 only wall with Yggrite's death.
Episode 10 there won't be time with two of the most shocking deaths in KL. Tyrion and Varys and Jaime convo. And also The UnCat reveal. 
No need to put another scene with Lysa flying out because it would decrease the.importance of the scene as the viewer will be taken aback by other things, a minor character dying is almost forgetable.

You're not talking about Tommen you're talking about the actors. Is it really that hard for people to understand there is a difference? Tommen is around 12 now according to the show-wiki. Which, yes, is a retcon because Loras had a line about Tommen being 8 in season 1, and we now that way less than 3 or 4 years have passed because Sansa is still 14 for some strange reason (said she was 13 in season 1 and should really be 15 now).

Why not? He looks young. Some actual 13-year olds look older than he does. I don't think he looks older than Isaac, and he's 14. We're also supposed to think that Jojen is, what, 15 (?), even though the actor is almost 24. But it works because he's slender and baby faced, and the only people who ever bring up Thomas Brodie-Sangster's age are those who have checked his date of birth.
Â 
I'm amused by the "Tommen's right hand" and "lucky Tommen" comments... A little while ago, when one of the trailers for the season was released and it had a shot of Sansa in bed, someone in comments on WiC.net wondered "is she touching herself?" and that silly little comment brought a landslide of rants against the "perv" and how sick and twisted, apparently, the idea of a teenage girl developing a sexuality is... But now when it's a boy (even though he's supposed to be even younger) all the comments are "Tommen must be masturbating to Marg now", "ooooh lucky Tommen nudge nudge wink wink". Hmm...

It won't be in this episode, or the next considering how packed it already is and how often we've seen Littlefinger and Sansa. If they do show the wedding! it'll happen in episode 7, I agree. But, consider these scenarios:
The wedding is in episode 7. Only Cat happens in episode 10. Everything seems good, but the title mockingbird would seem to be pointless if all that happened was a wedding and a few loath-full interactions.
The wedding is in episode 7. Only Cat, like many people suspect, also happens in episode 7. Having these two events in the same episode will make the unsullied shit themselves whenever the word "wedding" is mentioned, especially with all the plotting involving Margaery and Tommen. Imagine the unsullieds' fear at the prospect of Hizdahr and Dany marrying, and their joy of Ramsay and fArya, should they choose to include that.
We know it's in an Alex Graves episode, so it's either in 8 or 10.
Do you have a link to this information?

Which, yes, is a retcon because Loras had a line about Tommen being 8 in season 1, and we now that way less than 3 or 4 years have passed because Sansa is still 14 for some strange reason (said she was 13 in season 1 and should really be 15 now).
Â 


Â 
I know there is a difference. I also know that the previously cast actor would also look older than the show canon character. Most complaints are that Tommen V2.0 is 'so much older' when in fact he is not all that much older than his successor.
4716	ambi76	2014-04-28	Do you have a link to this information?
Â 
I just remember that you could see Graves in the season 4 featurette (will look up which one it was), where they showed Dickie and her stuntwoman and Sophie and Aidan all in front of the moon door, giving some direction to Gillen.

I'm amused by the "Tommen's right hand" and "lucky Tommen" comments... A little while ago, when one of the trailers for the season was released and it had a shot of Sansa in bed, someone in comments on WiC.net wondered "is she touching herself?" and that silly little comment brought a landslide of rants against the "perv" and how sick and twisted, apparently, the idea of a teenage girl developing a sexuality is... But now when it's a boy (even though he's supposed to be even younger) all the comments are "Tommen must be masturbating to Marg now", "ooooh lucky Tommen nudge nudge wink wink". Hmm...


Â 
Is it really a double standard, though? In both cases the same type of people (straight men) are making the comments. Obviously in that case the comments towards Sophie Turner are a bit creepier, even though the comments towards Tommen (and Margaery) are also pretty gross and unnecessary.

I watched the directing season 4 video, and there's a shot with Gillen and Graves talking, with Gillen in what you'd assume were his bed robes. I don't recall anything with Dickie or Sophie.
4719	ambi76	2014-04-28	There was definitely a moon door scene shot in one of the featurettes (I though "A Foreshadowing" but maybe another one) because they were flipping out about it on winteriscoming.net. Will take a while to hunt for it there was so much promo stuff for season 4.
Â 
ETA: The scene's shot is in the "Production Designer" featurette. There are so many staff in it, that it's hard to make them all out. Could have sworn I saw Graves though. The one fiddeling with Gillen is a make-up artist though.

Needle isn't Valyrian steel, where would Jon Snow have gotten the Valyrian steel from? And who could have reforged Valyrian steel in Winterfell?
4725	Arkash	2014-04-28	I really hope that both Sansa and Tommen get their puberty and awakening to sexuality this season ! It can give some really great development to both characters. Mostly Sansa, it could really build up a lot of her character.
4726	Dany's Silver	2014-04-28	Aegon conquered the seven kingdoms with like 3000 men and 3 dragons to start, so Dany's ahead of him at this point.


King's Landing wasn't built at that point, though, so there was no centralized position that he had to conquer; where in ASoIaF and in Game of Thrones, conquering KL is the thing to do if you want to conquer Westeros.Â  Mind you, given the size (and irascibility) of Dany's dragons, she's not conquering all of Westeros just yet....Â  Not without help from Dorne.
Â 


Â 
Why not? He looks young. Some actual 13-year olds look older than he does. I don't think he looks older than Isaac, and he's 14. We're also supposed to think that Jojen is, what, 15 (?), even though the actor is almost 24. But it works because he's slender and baby faced, and the only people who ever bring up Thomas Brodie-Sangster's age are those who have checked his date of birth.
Â 
I'm amused by the "Tommen's right hand" and "lucky Tommen" comments... A little while ago, when one of the trailers for the season was released and it had a shot of Sansa in bed, someone in comments on WiC.net wondered "is she touching herself?" and that silly little comment brought a landslide of rants against the "perv" and how sick and twisted, apparently, the idea of a teenage girl developin g a sexuality is... But now when it's a boy (even though he's supposed to be even younger) all the comments are "Tommen must be masturbating to Marg now", "ooooh lucky Tommen nudge nudge wink wink". Hmm...


Of course there's a double standard regarding female masturbation.Â  I recently heard that Girls (HBO) removed a scene with female masturbation (but had no problem with male masturbation). Â  Fully developed female sexuality doesn't seem to be as important showing as T&A as possible.Â  Otherwise, we might have seen a sexually frustrated Dany find release with the help of one of her handmaidens, but they'll no doubt skip that and head straight to Daario... I bet that when Jorah realizes that this is going his relationship with Dany turns sour and he'll be off to Volantis!
4727	Konradsmith	2014-04-28	So do we all think we'll get a bit of Teams Dreadfort and Dragonstone this episode? I mean if Stan sets sail in episode six surely we need a scene where he finds out about Davey's letter to the IBOB. Also Roose...We need more of him.
4728	Stannisneverlikedcats	2014-04-28	I predict Bran wargs into Hodor and starts owning everyone. That's how he escapes from Crastor's.
Â 
Also waiting for Cersei to kill the High Septon. I hope it happens in this season. Maybe he knows about the sept-sex and confronts her about it? Her motives for doing it in the book wouldn't be very clear on the show right now, unless Lancel comes back next season and does his confession.

What difference would that make.Â  Aegon still had to defeat or intimidate the armies of the seven kingdoms, and with six of them he managed it.Â  The existence of a capital city doesn't change anything.

no, this will be 3 straight epiosdes without ramsay and reek. they will be back in episode 6 as will team dragonstone. as for roose looking more and more likely we will not see him until episode 10.

Â 
The posters on WiC.net don't announce their gender and sexual orientation every time they post. You are just assuming that the poster was a straight man.
4732	Carne	2014-04-28	I predict Bran wargs into Hodor and starts owning everyone. That's how he escapes from Crastor's.


Â 
Hodor looks really angry in the preview. My guess is that while Karl and the other mutineers are outside fighting Jon, Rast will get less than friendly with Bran/Meera/Jojen. Hodor has had enough and lay the smack down on Rast and the remaining mutineers. Giving our heroes a chance to escape.

4733	SkaggCannibal	2014-04-28	What is it exactly that Lysa says in the trailer? I can't really make it out, but sounds promising.
Â 
That conversation between Sansa and Lysa could be gold, finally some family talk on the RW, Cat, rest of the Tully family and the future. And a hug! That will be fun to watch. Oh yes I love Lysa. Hope she gives some of her wisdom to Sansa, like how Robb, Cat and Ned should have acted according to her.
Â 
Dany in Meereen should be entertaining enough, the fall-out of the sack, but probably not that eventful and just a table-conversation. All that talk of King's Landing does make me dream of Quentyn showing up, although that's still a season away. What is it exactly Dany will be doing in Meereen this season? Trying to rule, forge alliances, see Yunkai rise against her, lock up the dragons and maybe marry Hizdahr? Is it going as far as a wedding? I hope not because that would mean no Quentyn.
Â 
Can't wait for that Northern bullshit to end and have Bran and co on their way and out of the picture, Jon on the Wall were he belongs and Craster's Keep+the wives never to be seen by show-watcher's eyes. Still gonna have to deal with Sam+Gilly+Mole's Town bullshit, but at least that's not next episode.
Â 
And Cersei will be magnificent as always, hopes she gets to drink her wine. Would be a great loss if she didn't.

Can't wait to see more of Tommen and Ser Pounce. The Cersei/Margaery rivalry looks like it is going to be epic.Â 
Â 
No Boltons??? Don't really need more torture scenes but would love to see more of Roose, Fat Walda and Theon.Â

Welcome, Kikia!Â  
Â 
As to Sandor staying alive beyond his date of 'death' in the books, my guess would be 'no,' but we'll still see more of him this season, so there's that.Â  Once Arya hops on a boat and heads for Braavos, that leaves the Hound with no one to interact with, so I think we're going to watch him 'die,' and then hopefully later, we'll be introduced to the mysterious gravediffer on the Quiet Isle.Â  That's just my take on his future, of course.Â  Who knows?
4740	salmonsnake	2014-04-28	IIRC, in an interview posted in winteriscoming, Rory said this is his toughest season so far, physically, due to 3-4 fight scenes. We've seen one, so there's plenty of time for him to get wounded.
4741	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-28	There's no way that Tommen didn't rub one out after Margaery left the room.


 Â
4742	salmonsnake	2014-04-28	WRT what Lysa says, it is "Why does he feel responsible for you!?" to Sansa and "What wife would do for you the things I've done for you?" to Petyr
4743	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-04-28	What I've gleamed from the synopsis, promo and Knight of the Gate actor's scheduled appearance (more info on WICnet):
Â 
-

As far as I can tell, no Brienne, Yara, Dreadfort, Wildlings or Dragonstone.
In King's Landing, this appears to be a Cersei-heavy episode (like how Jaime was the center of King's Landing in episode four). Tommen is crowned, officially becoming King. Cersei notices Margeary's intent. Cersei speaks to Tywin about one or more of these: on Tyrells/Oberyn ("Whom can we trust?" -"Ourselves. Alone."), Daenerys ("Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world") and Tommen ("You'll fight over him like beasts until you tear him apart. I'll BURN our house to the ground before I let that happen"). Cersei speaks with Oberyn in the garden ("What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?" -"We can avenge them").
Jon and his brothers attack the mutineers at Craster's Keep. Jon reunites with Ghost and Bran gets away. Unknown if Jon and Bran meet. Unknown if Locke will attempt to kill Jon and/or die. Jon Snow fights, and likely kills, chief mutineer Karl.
Daenerys calls for a council and asks if she can move onto King's Landing. She decides to stay in Meereen and stabilize the region rather than abandon the slaves she's freed ("I will do what queens do. I will rule") . Unknown if Dany finds out that Astapor (and Yunkai?) has fallen into disorder since she left; I'm assuming so because that's part of the reason that she stays to rule.
Sansa and Littlefinger arrive at the Vale of Arryn and are let through to the Eyrie by the Knight of the Gate. They meet Lysa. Sansa confides in Lysa about the Red Wedding. Lysa's jealousy of Sansa blossoms ("Why does he feel responsible for you?"). Lysa demonstrates her love for Littlefinger ("What wife would do for you the things I've done for you?"). Unknown if they marry in this episode. They're moving fast with the jealousy angle, so I can see "Only Cat" happening in episode seven, as some have predicted.
Arya practices with Needle. Unknown if Sandor teaches Arya the gift of mercy in this episode (I hope so, it's getting late).

4744	Arkash	2014-04-28	Btw, do we know generally what day of the week the recap (Previously On) is released ?

Thanks, somehow I kept hearing "mid-wife".
4746	Konradsmith	2014-04-28	Good write-up Ignorant Bog Woman! We will be getting the Gift of Mercy and soon. Remember in Foreshadowing featurette, the scene where Arya and Sandor come across a wounded fellow and he says "maybe nothing is better than this." That'll be the gift of mercy. And I think it may be in the episode. Either that or in six or seven.
Â 
Arkash, I think we got it on Thursday or Friday last week. But earlier the week before.

4751	Konradsmith	2014-04-28	Bran warging Hodor is very likely. If you notice, the chain they tied around himÂ could be pretty easily removed from that post if he had the wherewithal to figure it out. So BranÂ could use Hodor's body to get away pretty easily. Plus he's a big guy who could take down a lot of weaselly mutineers.

A little note on the supposed Night's King, (which the Game of Thrones wiki people seem to be very convinced about).
I watched Elio & Linda's review of the episode, and they seem to be convinced that someone was looking for a name for the Other on the HBO viewer's guide and they stumbled upon, or thought they made up the Night's King. I recall them saying that they changed the name to just "white walker".
Also, that interview was posted the day after Elio saw the episode: he didn't get a "preview" like he did the first three and have prior knowledge of that change. I suspect that he just watched trailers and featurettes over and over and deduced that something different was happening; something that may spoil the books for us.

Well, George, heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a very prolific writer, heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s writing the best he can, but itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a big work, and heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not quite managing, perhaps, to keep pace.

I'm not reaching at all if you read the other forums on the subject of Jon's parentage you will see that the reeds and Bran are the two most likely sources from which Jon's parentage is revealed.The books had Ned Starks dream the show had very little so it is entirely plausible they might enlighten the viewers .Bran has already had a vision of Ned in the blackcells so he might be aware of what Ned was thinking about at that time .If it doesn't happen don't worry I won't be too disappointed
4761	House Ross	2014-04-28	Ghost reuniting with Jon!! Man I am digging everything going on at Craster's. Its about to explode. Hodor will def be warged by Bran.
Â 
I see Bran and Co. escaping whilst the Brothers scrap with the mutineers. Jon, knowing what is truly out there, would never allow his younger brother to continue on his quest. Especially knowing Bran is now the heir to Winterfell. Also, Jojen isn't looking so good...
Â 
Really hope Dany starts doubting herself this episode. Barri needs to lay some wisdom down. Hizdahr this episode?

What are the main discussion topics right now for fans of the series?
Well, George, heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a very prolific writer, heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s writing the best he can, but itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a big work, and heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not quite managing, perhaps, to keep pace. And itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s still possible heâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll manage, but thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a danger there. And so people are quite concerned.
A year from now, the shoe may be on the other foot. The showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s viewers may be the ones with information from future novels that we, the readers, donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have.
I think I know a bit about what will happen in upcoming episodes. [Also, Martin has spoken to the show's writers, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, about his plans for the series.] And one of the upcoming episodes looks to me like a spoiler for a future book that has not been published yet. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not sure. It could just be something that [HBO] created. But itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going to be very interesting to see what people say in a week or two, when they see this event.

This is from a recent interview posted today...you guys think this was from last episode and the interview took place prior? or?
Â 


Yes, I do think that.Â  The date on the interview is the date the article is published, which is today, of course.Â  But the interview itself was likely conducted a couple of weeks ago.Â  But then again, who knows what's coming in future episodes, right?Â  We're all unsullied now!
4763	salmonsnake	2014-04-28	I'm still wondering about the way Jorah's spying will be revealed and how. I'm sort of guessing it's an episode with Varys in the preview, and in this one we only see him distant, bowing to the new king. Is someone (Grey Worm?) going to catch him red-handed? The schism with Barristan doesn't somehow fit the way show's handled Essos
4764	Colonel Green	2014-04-28	"Breaker of Chains" only refered to Dany.
It could also have refered to Sansa escaping KL, Jaime and Cersei breaking their bound definitly, Tyrion freing Pod of his service, but these seem far fetched.


The last two, sure; the first is pretty obvious, I would think.
4765	Father of Dragons	2014-04-28	Yes, I do think that.Â  The date on the interview is the date the article is published, which is today, of course.Â  But the interview itself was likely conducted a couple of weeks ago.Â  But then again, who knows what's coming in future episodes, right?Â  We're all unsullied now!
I don't understand how a few shots of some Others can make Elio see what they're doing or what context they're being used in. He must be talking about something else.
4766	Jay92	2014-04-28	Ohh yes it is.
It starts after Tywin's death when Cersei makes her own calls.
But I am not complaining. Marg - Cersei fight is going to be the most interesting thing in KL!


Â 
Just because we were not privy to a Cercei POV during this doesn't mean it didn't start beforehand. I'd be surprised if it didn't.Â
4767	iheartseverus	2014-04-28	I don't understand how a few shots of some Others can make Elio see what they're doing or what context they're being used in. He must be talking about something else.


In the books, we still don't know what the WW do with all Craster's baby boys--we can guess, we can speculate, but we don't know.Â  Now, in the show, we know.Â  In the books, we never saw, never even heard of a... WW ruling council, or whatever those 13 dudes at the end were.Â  Now, we've seen them, we know they exist.Â  We know now that there is a hierarchy among the WW--that the tall, bearded WWs on dead horses that we thought were the actual threat, are in fact... generals?Â  Carrying out orders from the WW council and reporting to the WW council.Â 
Â 
I think if you browse through this thread, you'll get a better perspective on what new info this last episode actually disclosed:

Â 
Perhaps Jorah will come clean on his own. I don't know, perhaps an intimate conversation with Dany, Selmy or Grey-Worm brings him to confess.Â 
Â 
Not as exciting, but i doubt Barristan is keeping it a secret. Perhaps Hizdahr knows of Varys, and knows he was in league with him.
Â 
It's definitely something that needs to be done properly.
4770	Konradsmith	2014-04-28	Well we know from the "weeks ahead" promo that the Small Council will discuss Dany. Maybe Varys will try to initiate contact with Jorah againÂ and Jorah will be caught with a very incriminating scroll or something of the sort.

FYI, I submitted another thread, the 'Early look at Episode 5' like last week.Â  We'll see if/when its approved.
4772	Konradsmith	2014-04-28	^Let's hope soon.
4773	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-28	Â 
And 3 dragon-riders


And 3 dragons that were much much bigger than Dany's. Balerion was freaking 100 years old when Aegon's conquest took place.Â
4774	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-28	Ohh yes it is.
It starts after Tywin's death when Cersei makes her own calls.
But I am not complaining. Marg - Cersei fight is going to be the most interesting thing in KL!


I hope you mean the most interesting thing in KL next season? Tyrions whole storyline in KL (trial, trial by combat, visit to tower of the hand) the rest of the season is some of the greatest material in the series IMO.
4775	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-04-28	King's Landing wasn't built at that point, though, so there was no centralized position that he had to conquer; where in ASoIaF and in Game of Thrones, conquering KL is the thing to do if you want to conquer Westeros.Â  Mind you, given the size (and irascibility) of Dany's dragons, she's not conquering all of Westeros just yet....Â  Not without help from Dorne.
Â 
Of course there's a double standard regarding female masturbation.Â  I recently heard that Girls (HBO) removed a scene with female masturbation (but had no problem with male masturbation). Â  Fully developed female sexuality doesn't seem to be as important showing as T&A as possible.Â  Otherwise, we might have seen a sexually frustrated Dany find release with the help of one of her handmaidens, but they'll no doubt skip that and head straight to Daario... I bet that when Jorah realizes that this is going his relationship with Dany turns sour and he'll be off to Volantis!


So you acknowledge the KL comment but not the fact the she has 3 out of control dragons and is short 2 dragon riders? Also, the fact that her dragons are what 3 years old? Balerion was closer to 100. Her dragons cannot be even comparable in size to Aegon's.Â

I'm hoping the reveal comes through Barristan.Â  I feel (if I existed in that world) embarrassed for him--he was the great, honorable, above reproach knight that even Ned Stark's father, even Ned Stark, even Jaime Lannister respected and admired.Â  After Cersei/Joff humiliated him, he traveled halfway around the world to pledge his loyalty to House Targaryen, and all this time, he's done nothing, accomplished nothing (beyond killing that scorpion-wizard thing when he first arrives).Â  Episode after episode, he stands there, silent.Â  Jorah interacts with Dany, Grey Worm interacts with Dany, Ser Selmy... stands there.Â  And when he tried to give her sound advice, she rejected it.Â  Just seems he's being treated like an old hound that's long past his hunting days, but allowed to hang around the house for sentimental reasons.Â  I'd like to see Ser Selmy given a bit of respect, a few moments, scenes, in which we see why he was considered the most honorable and fearsome knight around.Â  Seems the take-down of Jorah could accomplish that, as well as give us, the audience, a huge boatload of background exposition--Selmy knows everything, all the secrets, all the skullduggery, all the background scoop on the Aerys Targaryen reign, lots of behind-the-scenes info on the King Robert reign.
Â 
I just think the show took pains to ratchet up Ser Barristan's creds from the beginning, the time to make use of that (if the show is going to, at all) is coming up.Â  The Jorah take-down, and then Barristan tossing a bit of cold water on Dany as she's becoming all full of herself as savior of the downtrodden and a wise and mighty ruler.Â  I think the show did a nice job back in the beginning of setting him up as the reasoned, honorable and respected advisor.Â  Hope they follow through with that.
4777	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-04-28	What I'm looking forward to:
Â 
I find the whole Craster's Keep situation very exciting. The build-up from last week will explode. Will Jon meet Bran? I hope not, but it could happen and I can't wait to find out. Will Locke attempt anything? I'd rather him stick around longer, but who knows. How will Summer get out? Will Hodor fuck shit up?? Ghost and Jon reunion!!!
Â 
LADY LYSA, how I love your endearing insanity! It's been too long!
Â 
And the Gift of Mercy and Arya's list (if it happens).
4778	Konradsmith	2014-04-28	Well, iheartseverus, Emilia Clarke said over the summer in a video interview that she learns about her father this season, doubtless from old Barry. I don't have a link but it was with an Australian guy (I think) who's also interview Kit Harrington, Natalie Dormer and Nikolaj. I loved Barry's reaction this episode when Dany said her justice line. He was thinking, "oh shit, this reminds me of something..." I wouldn't be surprised if we got some storytelling from him next episode or in ep. 6.

I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was obligated to respond to every single sentence in a post. In the preview, Dany asks if she can take King's Landing, and I was simply pointing out that Aegon didn't have a centralized seat of power in Westeros to conquer.Â  Â  Besides, I suspect that conquering Westeros is going to be the least of her concerns when she arrives in Westeros (eventu-fucking-ally)....

4787	King Tommen	2014-04-28	What's really bugging me is what's happening with Yara and Balon this season, I can't figure it out.
Â 
Yara will have her attack on the Dreadfort in E6 and obviously it will fail but what's going to happen to her specifically? If the thinking is that she somehow gets beaten back and just slinks away so she can be back in Pyke later on, then I don't get the point of the deviation. First off, how are you supposed to reconcile her utter determination to save Theon at all costs with then having her say "Oh well, gave it the old college try, guess Theon's screwed now and I'll get on with other stuff..." And, really what would be the point dramatically of making a big point of her going out on this mission to have her show up in one episode, fail, and then go back to where she was? Why not just create stuff for her to do with Balon in Pyke before or when he dies?
Â 
I have to think that D&D deciding to send her on this path is because they truly want to alter her path.
Â 
It may be a coincidence but Roose definitely made a point of telling Ramsay that Greyjoy heir hostages were essential to his plan of getting the Ironborn out of the North so Ramsay should be suitably motivated to take another Greyjoy hostage if given the chance.
Â 
Obviously Moat Cailin is happening late in the season and Theon will be sent to treat with Ralf Kenning there but I wonder if they could use Yara as a negotiating tool there.
Â 
And finally, when the hell is Balon dying and are we going to see it? It's really bothering me and part of me wonders if the thing Ran described as a possible spoiler is the reveal of exactly how Balon is killed.

The only reason to hold off on Balon's death is so the Kingsmoot in season five wouldn't be too far apart. I don't think they want to make a timeline issue with Balon dying early in the season and then the Kingsmoot not happening for a whole season. In any case, I hope we get to see his death, but I have no idea how. Random transition? It would feel odd. Just like it would have felt cheap to simply transition to the City of Ice; they gave us a baby POV for a reason. Best I could think of is Arya saying 'Valar morghulis' to the Braavosi captain in the season finale and then cut to Pyke.
4789	oprahnoodlemantra	2014-04-28	now that ghost is back in the show do you think we will finally hear something about jons ability to warg into ghost


Here's what I'm what I'm hoping they do as far Jon's warging goes:
Â 
Jon is the closest thing the show has to a tradiotional hero. When he gets stabbed, show watchers are going to freak out. I'd like for the camera to sit on his 'dead' body and then slowly move towards his eyes to reveal that they've gone wight like Orell's and Bran's so his warging ability can be a big twist for show watchers.
4790	Seneti	2014-04-28	Â 
Tommen V1.0 was 11 when cast in S01, so he would be 15 now. Tommen V2.0 is 16


Â 
Wow... I never knew that. I'm really looking forward to Tommen's storyline and Margaery and Cersei fighting over him.
4791	Colonel Green	2014-04-28	Seeing as they're introducing Lady Waynwood and Yohn Royce, it seems like they'd have to go through the motions of hiding her identity. Probably won't be until they get safely into the Eyrie. My guess is "Mockingbird" will be the Alayne Stone debut.


They get to the Eyrie in this episode based on the promo, so I expect "Alayne" will come up then.
Â 


You guys think they're even going to try the 'Alayne Stone' thing? I know Sansa's hair won't be getting dyed, but will LF keep her identity a secret?


There's absolutely no way they could do anything remotely resembling Sansa's book plot without hiding her identity.
4792	Konradsmith	2014-04-29	LF may well call her "Alayne Stone" (I can hear Aidan Gillen rasping the name right now in my head) but it would be a pretty obvious lie given that she's not dying her hair and is wearing the same old clothes. Maybe he'll say "Here's my baseborn daughter Not-Sansa. Guess who she isn't? That's right, Sansa. She isn't Sansa." And then he'll give the camera a look like Ferris Bueller.
Â 
In all seriousness though, he'll either present her under that false name and kindof hide her in plain sight, or just not have her interact with people aside from Lysa and Robin.

The latter would not make any sense, seeing as there are plenty of other people at the Eyrie, and in the long-term his plans require her to be able to interact with others.

4795	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-04-29	I have to think that D&D deciding to send her on this path is because they truly want to alter her path.


I disagree. I think they want to flesh her out and tie her to the Moat Cailin story to enrich it by giving us a relevant and familiar Ironborn character there, before she becomes our POV in the Kingsmoot.
Â 
She's replacing not fArya, but Victarion. In the books, he left Ralf Kenning in charge once he heard wind of Balon's death. Â Yara will do the same.
Â 
Maybe they'll even have Theon reconsider joining Yara, and part of the impetus for handing over the remaining Ironborn to Ramsay is because Yara left for Pyke without him.
4796	The Taxman	2014-04-29	Whose the "First of his Name"?
Â 
Tommen?
4797	Konradsmith	2014-04-29	^I believe so. We see his coronation in the promo after all. I suppose it could apply to other characters too, but that's the simplest explanation.
4798	Ser Desmond Wine's Bane	2014-04-29	Â

"You mustn't let anything stop you."
4800	TeamLemonCakeBraavos	2014-04-29	My money is that the wedding between Petyr and Lysa will be this next episode, and the Snow Castle scene (aka "Only Cat") will be episode 7. I've been saying that for a while now, so there's nothing new there. Just felt like throwing my two cents in the bucket while I'm here. 
Â 
Side note: LOVE that Sansa has been in every episode this season (so far). Can't wait to see Lysa return. The actress who plays her (Lysa) does "crazy" and "eccentric" like NO OTHER!  The Moon Door scene between Sophie, Kate and Aiden should be EPIC! I'm incredibly excited. Â  Â  Â
4801	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2014-04-29	I think - and this is just a guess, no idea what's happening with this story anymore - the Arya and the Hound scene was her showing him her way of sword fighting (Syrio's way) and he's saying his way is better.


Also looks like that's how Hound gets his injury.
Â 
Poor unsullied, probably thing Dany is going to try to take KL after this preview.
4802	Konradsmith	2014-04-29	If that was how the Hound got his injury they wouldn't put it in the preview. Needle can't pierce armour and in the shot it clearly doesn't. I put my money on Sandor getting injured in episode eight.
4803	Mel_Rose	2014-04-29	^The Hound sounds more peeved than gravely injured.
4804	salmonsnake	2014-04-29	As remarked before, Hound still has fight scenes coming up this season. And I don't think he was referring to a something with Arya, as that doesn't sound (or look) very tolling, physically.
4805	Robbie Hood	2014-04-29	Now that anything can happen in GoTV, I can't wait to see {SPOILERS}Â Ned Stark resurrected by Samwell, and the reveal of Robb Stark warging into Sir Pounce moments before he died.

It's really bothering me and part of me wonders if the thing Ran described as a possible spoiler is the reveal of exactly how Balon is killed. what will happen to yara will be interesting to see, I could see a similar situation to stannis at blackwater were her renaming men pull her away from the battle. this could easily be just like the crasters keep ie a invented storyline to fill time. we shall see.
4808	protar	2014-04-29	I worry about the amount of truly interesting content they've got to carry the show until Shae's testimony and Oberyn vs. Gregor. Craster's looks like it will be some fun action filler, but will it be enough?
4809	Silver Prince	2014-04-29	What's really bugging me is what's happening with Yara and Balon this season, I can't figure it out.
Â 
Yara will have her attack on the Dreadfort in E6 and obviously it will fail but what's going to happen to her specifically? If the thinking is that she somehow gets beaten back and just slinks away so she can be back in Pyke later on, then I don't get the point of the deviation. First off, how are you supposed to reconcile her utter determination to save Theon at all costs with then having her say "Oh well, gave it the old college try, guess Theon's screwed now and I'll get on with other stuff..." And, really what would be the point dramatically of making a big point of her going out on this mission to have her show up in one episode, fail, and then go back to where she was? Why not just create stuff for her to do with Balon in Pyke before or when he dies?
Â 
I have to think that D&D deciding to send her on this path is because they truly want to alter her path.
Â 
It may be a coincidence but Roose definitely made a point of telling Ramsay that Greyjoy heir hostages were essential to his plan of getting the Ironborn out of the North so Ramsay should be suitably motivated to take another Greyjoy hostage if given the chance.
Â 
Obviously Moat Cailin is happening late in the season and Theon will be sent to treat with Ralf Kenning there but I wonder if they could use Yara as a negotiating tool there.
Â 
And finally, when the hell is Balon dying and are we going to see it? It's really bothering me and part of me wonders if the thing Ran described as a possible spoiler is the reveal of exactly how Balon is killed.


Â 
Â 
I believe that she will get captured by Stannis when he sails north to the Wall/Braavos, after she fails to rescue Theon and her crew will be likely decimated. It makes economy for next season. So, I don't beleieve we 'll see her at the Kingsmoot.
4810	Arkash	2014-04-29	Well, they still have some interesting stuff ahead before the last three episodes :Â 
Â 
- Preparing the defense at the Wall and with Janos Slynt mention of the election coming up, I feel like they will display it in episode 8, realising they really need a LC to organize them during the battle.
- Interractions at the Eyrie (like everyone else, I'm really looking forward to that).
- Some great moments in Tyrion's cell. I wonder who else, apart from Oberyn will visit him ? Tywin ? Bronn ?Â 
- Arya and the Hound getting in more trouble (Hound injury in 8 I guess).
- Reintroduction of the Mountain.
- Tommen's coronation and wedding (we know the coronoation is next episode but is the wedding too ?)
- Trial in episode 6.
- Iron Bank and Stannis sailing.
- I wonder if we'll see Mance before the episode 9 (sight of him in episode 7 or 8 maybe).
Â 
There's still a lot of good stuff before the last three episodes that are gonna be fucking fantastic !

Â 


Â 
Â 
Remember in the trailer 1, when Alister Thorne says " Tonight We Fight" and Locke is behind him, probably is in ep9 as Battle of the Wall, so we can assume that the LC election will be in ep10, but sure their will may be some scheming of Slynt and Thorne of LC before that.Â 
Â 
In terms of Asha/Yara I really dont know what is going to go on, we will presume her attack on The Dreadfort will fail, so she could then retreat to Moat Cailin which is a far way, which then makes Ramsay speed up his attack of it, and she then flees MC to Pyke again in time for the KM, or she hears that Balon has died and then leaves MC to Pyke. I guess that are may only ideas but thats only in ep6 most likely
Â 
However back to ep5, really interested in Dany's council when she says does she have enough to attack KL, and Jorah's face and the rest saying hell no! Do you think that maybe Dany doesnt ever find out about Jorah, but instead sends him to Volantis to recruit sellswords? Â
4812	Daughter of Death	2014-04-29	Â 
I was half expecting the scene to end with him awkwardly reaching down below under the blankets.
Â 
Btw, just how old is Tommen supposed to be in-show? The actor looks like's he's about fifteen, but the last time we saw Tommen on the show he couldn't have been older than ten. Are we supposed to believe the Tommen in the show right now is about 12 or 13? I'm somewhat confused on this matter.


Â 
i actually think they kid in the show could pull off 13. he has such an innocent face. and in that scene with marg and him she's clearly older and he's clearly a kid. he might not be a stupid child but he's innocent, easily manipulated and sweet. only thing that matters.
4813	Father of Dragons	2014-04-29	In the books, we still don't know what the WW do with all Craster's baby boys--we can guess, we can speculate, but we don't know.Â  Now, in the show, we know.Â  In the books, we never saw, never even heard of a... WW ruling council, or whatever those 13 dudes at the end were.Â  Now, we've seen them, we know they exist.Â  We know now that there is a hierarchy among the WW--that the tall, bearded WWs on dead horses that we thought were the actual threat, are in fact... generals?Â  Carrying out orders from the WW council and reporting to the WW council.Â 
Â 
I think if you browse through this thread, you'll get a better perspective on what new info this last episode actually disclosed:
Â http://asoiaf.wester...d/#entry5707145

You're not understanding my point. We have been spoiled, yes, I understand that. Elio said we may get spoiled and I assume that he's come to this conclusion from watching clips. We got about two shots of the WW in trailers snd featurettes so it's unlikely that this is what he was referring to. Think about it. There are hundreds of us and only Elio and (probably also) Linda. How could they see what hundreds of others could not, since he only got a preview of the first three episodes and nothing further?
4814	Dany's Silver	2014-04-29	I disagree. I think they want to flesh her out and tie her to the Moat Cailin story to enrich it by giving us a relevant and familiar Ironborn character there, before she becomes our POV in the Kingsmoot.
Â 
She's replacing not fArya, but Victarion. In the books, he left Ralf Kenning in charge once he heard wind of Balon's death. Â Yara will do the same.
Â 
Maybe they'll even have Theon reconsider joining Yara, and part of the impetus for handing over the remaining Ironborn to Ramsay is because Yara left for Pyke without him.


Â 
I want to see her sail to Meereen then to claim Dany as her bride.
4815	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-04-29	Â

I totally wouldn't mind D&D throwing gratuitous sex scene that one time.
4816	Arkash	2014-04-29	That would be quite funny to have Yara sail to Meereen.
Â 
I must confess I have absolutely no theory about what they'll do with Yara... failing to attack the Dreadfort and back to the Iron Islands ? Defender of Moat Cailin with Ralf Kenning ? Captured by Stannis on her way north ? ... They can go so many roads and I have no idea which one they'll take ! I just still hope we get an amazing Kingsmoot next season, cause it would be the perfect scene to introduce the Greyjoy uncles and having the familiar face of Yara there would be the best, imo.

I'm just excited that we're finally going to see Asha kick some ass (or at the very least, involved!). She's always been a favourite of mine in the books just behind Jon and Arya, so I'm hoping she does have more of a presence in the show now that we're heading into AFFC/ADWD territory.
Â 
I really can't see where they're going with Asha's story arc, but I just hope it doesn't feel too contrived or wasted - and I'm sorta worried she'll become a tortured prisoner. Definitely excited though. I can live with her missing the Kingsmoot if she's going to slay some Bolton men (or a certain woman, for that matter). But seriously; if you rob me of the Theon/Asha reunion outside Winterfell's walls... dark days, indeed!

honestly dont understand dropping the alayne stone thing. Â its so fucking simple. Â theres no alayne without the dark hair
4826	King Tommen	2014-04-29	There are countless examples of people hiding in plain sight without having to dye their hair (like that is some kind of ultimate deceptor anyways). People need to stop fixating on that one detail just because that's what happened in the books.

So being able to see the past, present and future; by touching a Weirwood tree, which is a symbol of the Old Gods is just a minor trick? I'm not discounting the power of the "Gods", but I very much doubt they are actually real. It's more likely different factions of magical use, which of course to some, can seem god-like. But to say that the power in the North(Bran and Bloodraven), is not on par with that of Mel's power(Red God) is a bit much. Even more so, when in the books we have seen Mel have a vision of Bran and Bloodraven and she damn near pisses her self, in fear.
4828	darksellsword	2014-04-29	It seems to me that they did drop the Alayne Stone story because I don't recall from the books any point in which Sansa as Alyane was sobbing in Lysa's arms like they have shown in the promo. I don't see that changing the dynamics of their interactions. Lysa is still crazy and isn't very warm to her family anyway. I think this will speed up the Sansa arc too .My prediction is that Sansa will end up as sweet Robin's guardian after she kills little finger because he tries to rape her.

Â 
I'm not sure if they'll do the Alayne Stone thing or not, but I agree with your point about hiding in plain site. She can totally get away with this considering she hasn't been in the Vale since, what, she was a child (if ever! I don't recall if she ever visited The Vale before)? If that's the case, she won't be 'recognizable' to anyone even with red hair (save Yohn Royce).

4832	King Tommen	2014-04-29	In the books, Lysa is very aware that Sansa is Sansa and they do commiserate initially. Lysa gets jealous of her in about 10 seconds afterwards, but they do get to at least have some form of familial warmth when they first meet.

You are both right... and that kind of backs up my point.Â  Only the Red God and the enemies of the Red God have any power.Â  Maybe the Others and the ice they represent are the real good guys, the ones who will try to purify the world, while the forces of Azor Ahai and the Red God are trying to keep the world for evil... i.e. the People.

Â 
Petyr doesn't tell her who Sansa is until after their wedding night, so for the first day Lysa thinks Alayne is a bastard. Lysa is pleasant to her in the first scene after learning who Sansa is (and is the one who tells her to dye her hair).
Â 
The show is likely going to have Sansa introduced as Sansa to Lysa, and then adopt her fake identity, because it was always a little weird her aunt didn't recognize her (especially since she looks very much like Cat).

i've been spamming this explanation all over the forums so sorry If any of you read this before but I think a plausible explanation would of been Sam putting

No, you didn't miss anything.Â  They never showed that.Â  She presumably found out about it offscreen at some point between episode 3.05 and episode 3.07.Â  One of the many irritating things about how they handled her story last year.
4840	King Tommen	2014-04-29	That is the most plausible explanation so far, but I doubt that Ghost (book Ghost) would have even let Jon put him in a cage.


Â 
Jon locks Ghost up at Castle Black in ADwD and there are lots of instances of all the direwolves being locked up over the course of the books. I think it's plausible that Ghost, who is presumably with the NW crew that headed back to Craster's from the Fist after saving Sam from the wight, would be locked up outside (probably by Sam) since Craster wouldn't want him anywhere near the Keep.
Â 
It's a bit of a contrivance but I certainly like this explanation better than that he was just dicking around North of the Wall not doing anything for the past couple seasons.
4841	darksellsword	2014-04-29	oh I remember what I wanted to talk about. This next episode with Jon, Bran and the Mutineers seems like a red wedding redo scenario .
Greywind was penned up like ghost is now. Robb couldn't fight back against a swarm of cut throat frey traitors Jon will against the traitors of the nights watch .Arya never got to be renunited with Robb but Bran has that chance with Jon.

4843	Konradsmith	2014-04-29	The return of Kate Dickie! It's funny how it's been three years and she (and the Mountain) are still remembered. Admittedly she's mostly called "the one who still breast-feeds her son" or "the crazy aunt" by the casuals, but if that's enough to make them feel uneasy about Sansa (and to their minds, Arya) arriving at the Eyrie then that's a good thing. I bet you Kate Dickie and Sophie will really kill that commiseration scene.
Â 
Also after Michelle MacLaren's work on Sunday, I can't wait to see what she has upÂ her sleeveÂ for next week. The lighting in particular was really awesome and I can't wait to see how she lights that Eyrie set, which is one of the best made for the show and has been missed.

This. We need to remember that Westeros is a place where travelling from one side of the country to the other takes months (no cars, no planes, no trains or coaches) and there is no such thing as TV or the internet - the chances that anybody in the Vale would ever have met Sansa, let alone remember her face, are more than slim.

4848	King Tommen	2014-04-29	Here's the deal: every time something big happens on the show, they can't just zoom around to the 10 other storylines located all over the world to see how each of those groups of characters react to this news. There is often an assumed shorthand that they get the news off-screen at some point. It may be referenced down the road but you can't repeat the same info to different characters just to show their reaction because it gets repetitive. We get Cat and Robb's reaction to the news and the assumption is that the rest of the Starks would feel just as awful whenever they got the news too.

Â 
On another thread, someone suggested that the NW member they could be planning to substitute into the Bowen Marsh role is Pyp. That hadn't occurred to me before but it actually would make a lot of sense. Pyp is not a longtime NW vet like Marsh was but he's a steward who you could certainly see promoted into a bigger role by Jon once he becomes LC. Pyp being a friend of Jon who slowly starts to disagree with his opinions would make for a more dramatic journey and the ultimate betrayal would be more emotional.Â  If they were looking to use an existing character who the audience knows and is sympathetic to as opposed to bringing in an unknown guy who supposedly was hanging around the background all along, then I wouldn't mind it.
Â 
I have no idea what they have in store for Locke but if they are trying to make him the one who ultimately turns on Jon, it completely alters that entire arc and I'm not sure if that's what they're looking to do. Locke is an undercover evil spy looking for an opportunity to take out all the living Starks, not a supposed confidant who loses faith in Jon's leadership and eventually feels like killing him is the only way to save the NW.

(1)Â  In the books, Sansa found out about it in the gap between books, whereas in the show she had to have found out about it during the actual season due to how the writers altered the news getting out, so that's very different.
(2)Â  While we didn't see her learn about the news, we did see her acknowledge their deaths and the impact it had on her, which the show has not done at all (indeed, she was cheery as hell in the episodes in question).Â  Even when she's in mourning at the beginning of the season, she only talks about her mother and Robb -- I've seen many Unsullied who are confused about whether she even knows about it, which is very poor story structure.
Â 


Here's the deal: every time something big happens on the show, they can't just zoom around to the 10 other storylines located all over the world to see how each of those groups of characters react to this news. There is often an assumed shorthand that they get the news off-screen at some point. It may be referenced down the road but you can't repeat the same info to different characters just to show their reaction because it gets repetitive. We get Cat and Robb's reaction to the news and the assumption is that the rest of the Starks would feel just as awful whenever they got the news too.


No, you can't just assume that, since the characters are in different places, and Sansa never shows an indications she knows about it, nor is she written in a way that suggests she's heard about it.Â  The deaths of her brothers directly affects Sansa.Â  We should have seen something about it.

In reading this, I don't really see much of anything about her reaction or any kind of significant impact it had on her. It's barely, barely mentioned in passing and definitely not in dialogue with another character which is how the show has to relay information.
Â 
On the show, she doesn't think she has any family anymore, that much appears pretty clear. Do we need her to specifically say "Bran and Rickon" for that to be confirmed?

In the books Cat even thinks they are dead as she gets a raven reporting as much.Â  She dies thinking only Sansa and Arya are left of her clan, while in the show she dies thinking of Bran and Rickon as "missing" only.

On another thread, someone suggested that the NW member they could be planning to substitute into the Bowen Marsh role is Pyp. That hadn't occurred to me before but it actually would make a lot of sense. Pyp is not a longtime NW vet like Marsh was but he's a steward who you could certainly see promoted into a bigger role by Jon once he becomes LC. Pyp being a friend of Jon who slowly starts to disagree with his opinions would make for a more dramatic journey and the ultimate betrayal would be more emotional.Â  If they were looking to use an existing character who the audience knows and is sympathetic to as opposed to bringing in an unknown guy who supposedly was hanging around the background all along, then I wouldn't mind it.
Â 
I have no idea what they have in store for Locke but if they are trying to make him the one who ultimately turns on Jon, it completely alters that entire arc and I'm not sure if that's what they're looking to do. Locke is an undercover evil spy looking for an opportunity to take out all the living Starks, not a supposed confidant who loses faith in Jon's leadership and eventually feels like killing him is the only way to save the NW.


I agree with you completely that the books version of events is far superior. I can't see how they can get the audience to the point were they know these secondary Characters to the extent that they see their problems with Jons leadership not in a tv show with such limited time. It would be much easier for them to have a villain lurkering around obviously intent on killing Jon, for me if Locke doesn't make an attempt on Jon's life in the next few episodes then it will be a confirmation that he is the conspirator and Jon will get stabbed next season.

When they show her in mourning for Catelyn and Robb, the first time she's ever been shown in mourning since Ned's death, and Bran and Rickon are never mentioned, yeah, it's far from clear.
4855	King Tommen	2014-04-29	No, I've been listening carefully for that.

Â 
There's actually a scene later on in the show where Catelyn basically tells Robb that there's no way they're missing as he insists is still a possibility.
4856	Annara Snow	2014-04-29	In the books, Lysa is very aware that Sansa is Sansa and they do commiserate initially. Lysa gets jealous of her in about 10 seconds afterwards, but they do get to at least have some form of familial warmth when they first meet.


Â 
Lysa doesn't get jealous of her - visibly, at least - until the snow castle scene. The family warmth quickly disappears when Lysa tells Sansa she must marry her son (and Sansa immediately realizes that it's because of her claim to Winterfell, not any affection she has for her) and goes on to tell her that she's "little more than a beggar now", clearly implying that she has no choice. (In between there's also the lovely moment when Lysa asks Sansa if she's pregnant and shows her relief when she hears that she's still a virgin, since she wouldn't like her son to get "dwarf's leavings".)

True, but it's still just her intuition that tells her that, where in the books she gets a raven that states unequivocally that her two youngest boys are dead, burned and hanged.

Â 
But I think at this point it is. Her reaction to LF telling her that going to the Vale with Lysa is the only safe place for her would be an opportunity to mention Bran and Rickon if she thought they were still alive. It's obviously not mentioned, but I think her knowledge is very much implied. She learned about it and dealt with it off-screen. The same way Jon did with Robb and Cat.
4859	King Tommen	2014-04-29	True, but it's still just her intuition that tells her that, where in the books she gets a raven that states unequivocally that her two youngest boys are dead, burned and hanged.

Right. Not sure why that's really important. She knows in her heart that they're probably dead. Who cares if she gets 100% confirmation or not.

Â 
It would be high time to mention their "deaths" when she talks to Lysa, since Sansa's realization that everyone wants to marry her for her claim to Winterfell is such a big part of her arc and character development, and her status as the apparent heir to Winterfell is also a big part of LF's plans for her -Â  and that status is a direct consequence of Bran and Rickon's "deaths".

It makes her decision to let Jamie go make more sense.Â  In the show when she does it, she isn't even aware how much danger the boys could be in, so it's a bit less logical. In the books she is doing whatever she can to save the last of her kids besides Rob (who is going into battle every day, risking his life there).

This.
4864	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-04-29	The scene that everyone has been referring to as "THAT scene", supposedly super gruesome, isnt that supposed to be in this ep? I wonder if that's gona be related to NW fight at Craster or something the Ironborn r up to...popular theory was that Mountain will be killing the farmer and kid....since technically Hound was supposed to be injured in the first ep (in the fight where Arya got needle back) and that is the injury that kills him, i wonder if they going to turn it in to a fight between the Mountain and the Hound...that should be pretty gruesome too...
Â 
i too have no idea where they gona go with Asha's story this ep...might be something simple just to inform everyone that Balon "slipped" and died
4865	Konradsmith	2014-04-29	The scene of violence that Michelle MacLaren's DP said had to be toned down, yes, that will be in this episode, because the HBO schedule says this week's episode will have graphic violence unlike last week's. In all likelihood it will have to do with the fight with the mutineers, potentially either with some sword- fight gore (remember Cat Taylor's update behind the scenes that they were using a ton of "sword blood") or maybeÂ it'll beÂ direwolf-mauling-some-hapless-prick gore.

Â 
Oh ok. But this is a completely different discussion you're having (one that's been analyzed to death on these forums since back in S2). While she doesn't have the same knowledge that she does in the books, the show establishes that the Karstarks are so enraged with Jaime that they'll probably kill him if she doesn't do something drastic (this plot point isn't there in the books). So they provided a different kind of motivation for her to make the release.

Geez, thanks for bringing up an oldie but a goodie debate.
4867	Konradsmith	2014-04-29	^And it's also off-topic really. Sansa speculation is fine, Lysa and LF speculation is fine but really Cat speculation only applies to episode ten.

4868	jentario	2014-04-29	Looks like a cool episode (that will wrap up the Craster's shenanigans- which I'm enjoying so far), the serious progress towards the Eyrie really is worrying. I really think "Only Cat" should happen just before the Stoneheart reveal, and that is likely happening in the finale. The fact that episode 7 is titled "Mockingbird" makes me worry :/
4869	Konradsmith	2014-04-29	^Well, hopefully it's only called that because it features some LF Vale funny business and potentially the wedding (I don't know what colour to call it).
4870	Widows_Blood	2014-04-29	I thought the "toned down" scene happened in Oathbreaker?
4871	Opisthokont!	2014-04-29	I have a gut feeling that the title of this episode "first of his name " does not refer to Tommen after all we know he is not the first of his name.


Many episode titles have had double meanings. The obvious one for this title is Tommen. I can't really think of a secondary one - first I thought it was a reference to Balon, and that he would die in this episode, but according to the wiki he is the ninth Balon to be king of the Iron Islands. It can't be Euron either, in case they'd decide to skip the whole Kingsmoot and just introduce and crown him in the same episode as Balon dies, since he is the third Euron.
Â 
If Balon dies in this episode it could be a reference to Theon - someone might make an offhand remark that if Theon wasn't disinherited he would have been the first of his name. But that seems a bit contrived.
Â 
Daenerys is probably the first Daenerys to rule Meereen, but that's not his name.

Locke doing it turns it into a Bolton plot rather than a representation of corruption within the NW and Bowen is a background character.

I actually love that the show has it set up that both Ghost and Summer are right there at Craster's.Â  One in a cage (however that happened) and the other in some kind of rope-snare trap, it seems.Â  So, Bran wargs Hodor, Hodor frees both wolves, and here we go!Â  Mutineer Munchies, direwolf style.Â  I think (hope) that they're really going to play this up.Â  So much of the CGI has been devoted to the dragons and this seems the perfect scene to give us some really awesome direwolf action.Â  Looking forward to it.

people need to stop telling people how to think...on that note...sansa is an auburn headed blue eyed beautiful high born looking lady...when word is spread that sansa stark has escaped kings landing and is wanted for the murder of the KING...well we all know how pennys brother died (cercei offering a knighthood or money or (whatever it was i forget) to whoever brings her the head of tyrion) Brienne is specifically looking for a young lady with auburn hair with a fool...brienne then believes the fool she runs into on the road is ser dontos (and we all now she is incorrect)...that being said this world is so focused on specific characteristics and traits. Facebook was not around then so they didnt know EXACTLY what people looked like that they never met, but they are given specific details about their appearance so that they can find them (auburn hair, blue eyed lady) Â Lady Lysa is Catelyns sister...the Tullys are known for their auburn hair...now a beautiful high born looking lady with auburn hair suddenly arrives to the vale should definitely spark some conversation. Â Im not saying that dying your hair will suddenly turn you invisible, but it will certainly deter someone who is looking for a lady with auburn hair. Â many non book readers who ive spoken to are concerned sansa will be spotted in the vale. Â if they were to change the appearance itwould jut be a nice and EASY thing for the showrunners to add to the show...it would also be cool because as book readers we are reading "alaynes" chapters. Â It would be a nice thing for sansas character to give the audience something new, and like she is a different person who is growing. Â

Thanks! I cannot stand all that whining. If show with violence and nudity makes people uncomfortable no one is forcing them to watch it. I find nudity excessive sometimes but I don't think it's that bad this season and the talk of alleged violence towards women and misogyny is something I find to be particularly stupid, considering how the book content that wasn't used on the show was far worse than some of the invented scenes. With all the amazing things on GoT the focus on these factors in people's reviews is so annoying.
4899	Konradsmith	2014-04-29	^Especially now these really politicised reviews from the Guardian and HuffPost and whatnot. Fuck them.

Â 
Back to the topic at hand, the promo, should we discuss that the Knight of the Gate will appear this episode? I assume through the Sansa/LF viewpoint and he will return through Arya's eyes in episode eight. Some of us have surmised that he will wound the Hound, which is very plausible because the actor playing him is almost as tall/as tall as Rory McCann. If anyone could do it, it would be him.

Â 
Free press is always a good thing, right? 
Â 
But yeah, I agree with you. Sheer opportunism. I really, really urge everyone to go find a bunch of original reviews for 4x03Â Breaker of Chains. Since the media outlets had that episode well in advance, the reviews were written early and went online as soon as the episode aired, before the entire manufactured bullshit went all sanctimonious. There's barely a beep about Jaime and Cersei in something like 95% of those reviews. No outrage whatsoever. No accusations of character assassination, sexism, nothing. Then, after primarily bookwalkers went apeshit crazy all over the net, suddenly there's a bunch of "respectable" sites and newspapers expressing their utter dismay and disbelief. Nothing more than opportunistic nonsense and clickbait.

4901	Konradsmith	2014-04-29	^And in some ways controversies help the show. It's just annoying to read rehash cookie-cutter outrage articles. But if you look at Scorcese movies or Kubrick or Lars von Trier, they really are propelled by controversy and word of mouth, so in the end the hand-wringing and whatnot is helpful.
Â 
Again I'll try to pivot back to the promo though, so how about them Arya swordplay moves? Maisie really is great.

Â 
In the next shot, Locke in standing behind him, so that means the shots wouldn't be in chronological order, but we've seen that before iirc.Â

I think Locke is somehow gonna mange to take Bran and them hostage (why they wounded Hodor) and then Coldhands is gonna kill him on teh way to the wall
4905	Arkash	2014-04-29	^Well, hopefully it's only called that because it features some LF Vale funny business and potentially the wedding (I don't know what colour to call it).

Â 
Yeah, maybe it's nothing and he's reporting or just telling something. But it might be a sign shit's about to go down there.Â 
Â 
Or could it be the scene where Locke takes his vows, before they move in further?
4907	Father of Dragons	2014-04-29	I think it's more likely he was scouting ahead to see if Bran and Rickon were there. After all, he heard a little bit of Jon and Sam's conversation in Oathkeeper and maybe they confront him about sneaking off. He probably comes up with a reasonable excuse and then helps them fight.
4908	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-04-29	I hope Locke survives the episode. I enjoy the character tremendously.
4909	King Tommen	2014-04-29	Watch this and tell me that you don't want Locke to just say "screw it" and become best buds with Jon:

4910	Konradsmith	2014-04-29	^But that was all false charm and him playing Jon like a fiddle. It was awesome how efficient and good at his job Locke is, but I don't think heÂ gives two shits about Jon. I don't know if he'll die next episode (I would like to have him around for longer, so I hope he doesn't) butÂ either something will happen to him or he will do something big himself.

Â 
If Locke's involved in E9 and helps the NW win the fight, they'll be running along a thin line of making the character pretty sympathetic. It's hard not to like Noah Taylor even when he's being an asshole. I even thought it was awesome that he and Ramsay were chums. He's a helluva guy.
4912	Konradsmith	2014-04-29	^If. But I don't think that the person behind Thorne when he says "tonight we fight" is him. He has a similar goatee but not the scars or any of the identifiable features of Noah Taylor. Unless Locke and Jon are told by the mutineers that Bran is dead, I think Locke will take his leave from the ranging and tag along after Bran's merry band. Unless Jon finds him out or he gets wounded, I don't see any circumstance in which Locke returns to CB.

Â 
Certainly possible but it's weird that they made a point of him taking his NW vows so quickly if he's just going to almost immediately disappear. Actually really looking forward to this episode to see exactly how the Craster's stuff plays out. We know more or less what the end result is going to be but Locke being there is a wildcard and the question of if Jon and Bran actually do cross paths and exactly how Bran escapes will be interesting.
4914	Konradsmith	2014-04-29	^Yeah, "First of His Name" looks like it will be a great episode. Michelle MacLaren's work on "Oathkeeper" was really excellent, almost Alex Graves quality. Though I'm sure Graves will retain his title by the end of the season with "the Mountain and the Viper" and "the Children", MacLaren will come close I think. Maybe she'll do four episodes next season to make up for Graves taking a break from the show. I think David Nutter will be coming back and probably Alik Sakharov, but hopefully she does too. The lighting in particularÂ in "Oathkeeper" was fantastic.

4916	~No One~	2014-04-29	I loved that scene between Locke & Jon. Locke's really got it in for highborn, eh? 
I really like how the TV version is intertwining storylines...we get so much of that in the books, but many of those details don't translate to TV, so I'm actually a big fan of what's going on at the Wall. 
Very much excited to see Lysa!! And Arya didn't seem to be acting very aggressively...probably just showing the Hound her water dance to prove that she can....love, love, love Arya!
4917	doghouse	2014-04-29	I hope Ghost and Summer get free, approach Rast by having one of them sneak behind his legs while the other pushes him over, they tear off his face, piss on his corpse and then jump up really high in the air for a direwolf high-five.Â  Then Ghost can look at the camera, say "Who's thirsty now, motherfucker?", wink and Summer and him can laugh their asses off. Credits roll with "Won't Get Fooled Again" playing at full blast.

This may be the single greatest thing I have ever read on this forum.
4918	Mr Fixit	2014-04-29	Noah Taylor is incredible. I really hope the show finds a way to keep him around a bit longer.Â
4919	King Tommen	2014-04-29	He's so good that you kind of wonder if there was a major role they could have retroactively cast him in that really could have showcased him. He doesn't really fit the look of anyone I can think of but maybe Randyl Tarly might have been cool (assuming Tarly is a bigger player in the unreleased books). If Benjen Stark did more stuff, I'd like him in that role too.
4920	DaveyJoe	2014-04-29	I was really pissed off about the exclusion of Vargo Hoat but Taylor has completely won me over. Â He has been a major highlight of the past two seasons.

Nah I think that Anthony Head would be better for Randyll Tarly. He is familiar with the asshole father role.Â
4923	Ser_Butters	2014-04-29	You know who I'm glad they have expanded the role for? Bronn! Jerome Flynn has absolutely nailed that part. I'm happy to see him take Payne's place. I truly do hope that Arya doesn't cause The Hound's wound, and that it is just a sword fight. Can't wait for First of His Name!
4924	King Tommen	2014-04-29	After having so many characters clogging up King's Landing at the start of the season, there's been a fairly decent mass exodus thusfar:
Â 
Joffrey
Brienne
Pod
Olenna
Sansa
Dontos
Â 
gone.
Â 
With Oberyn, Tywin, Shae, Varys and Tyrion still to go by the end of the season.
4925	Konradsmith	2014-04-29	No, Ser_Butters, if Arya were to wound the Hound they wouldn't put the image in the promo. They're just being misleading. The Hound will be wounded around episode eight, I presume. That way both Cleganes go down in the same episode.

Elio revealed in this brand new interview that the show was about to go again very soon in spoiler territory :
Â 
http://www.salon.com...rge_r_r_martin/
Â 
Â 
Since he's not sure if it's canon, I doubt it's R + L, but never thought of the show having Jon and the Reeds meet and reveal his lineage this way !
Â 
But it doesnt seem to be that !
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
"Breaker of Chains" only refered to Dany.
It could also have refered to Sansa escaping KL, Jaime and Cersei breaking their bound definitly, Tyrion freing Pod of his service, but these seem far fetched.
Â 
Â 

Â 
Â 

Looking forward ! Love watching those !
Â 


Â 
Â 
I could see it if Jojen Reed does indeed die (like many believe he will in the books), his dying last words are "R+L=J"
Â 
But after thinking about it, that would speed things up to a point of no interest for me anymore.
Â 
I could also see Jojen finally realizing Jon is AA just as he dies in a vision. *ult cliffhanger*
4930	Ruin	2014-04-29	The biggest deviation from the books will occur this episode...I think Ser Pounce might be poisoned, and Tyrion will be accused of regi/felinecide.
4931	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-04-30	Oh yeah and Dany finally changed her dress! There is a contingent of fans whoÂ are annoyedÂ that certain characters never change their costumes. This is for you all.
Â 
No such luck for Arya though. She's in the same jerkin still. At least in Braavos she'll likely need a different outfit. Poor Maisie.


How do you think they'll approach the face-changing concerning Maisie?
4932	Konradsmith	2014-04-30	^Maisie could dub her voice over other actresses, I guess. Or they couldÂ try some sort of green-screen mask approach but that would be hard to do seamlessly. It'll be a challenge for them, that's for sure.
Â 
I think they'll doÂ her BraavosÂ stuff very well. People enjoy watching her learn whether it be from Syrio, Jaqen or the Hound. A more difficult student-teacher arcÂ to adapt will be the S5 Bran one. I'm guessing that Bran will only have four or five appearances next season and they'll really play up his communication with Theon and potentially Melisandre to make his storyline seem more relevant and come up with more content.
Â 
Another thing. Issac said that Bran only appears in something like four episodes this season, but I'm going to have to go out on a limb and say he's incorrect there. Since he'll be in ep. 5, that makes three appearances already and I can't see him just dropping out of the show until the finale. I think he'll have at least one more appearance in episode seven or eight. Also, they have to name-drop the COTF before they get to the tree (don't they?) otherwise they'll just come completely out of the blue.

4933	VeturKemur	2014-04-30	I think they'll keep her face but show a different one in reflections or if we see her from someone else's POV. It's been done that way in film and TV before.
4934	Khal-a-bunga	2014-04-30	And Jaime (and presumably Bronn) early next season. King's Landing will turn into the Cersei / Margeary show, with some helpings of Pycelle and Qyburn.


Â 
Plus Ellaria (who I think will take the place of Lady Nym) and possibly Tyene, the High Sparrow, and Randyll Tarly. I think there's also a good possibility that Kevan & Lancel might be brought back into the picture next season, but my main idea is that the time formerly spent solely in King's Landing will now be split between that location and Dorne.Â
4935	Konradsmith	2014-04-30	^I think the High Sparrow is the most necessary of those characters. In the promo we see the current high septon yet again, so they are emphasizing him now, perhaps so that Cersei killing him off and replacing him next season will be a bigger deal.

4936	hedgeknight001	2014-04-30	What's really bugging me is what's happening with Yara and Balon this season, I can't figure it out.
Â 
I have to think that D&D deciding to send her on this path is because they truly want to alter her path.
Â 
It may be a coincidence but Roose definitely made a point of telling Ramsay that Greyjoy heir hostages were essential to his plan of getting the Ironborn out of the North so Ramsay should be suitably motivated to take another Greyjoy hostage if given the chance.

And Tywin stressed to Oberyn that the Greyjoys "are in open rebellion." They have to be returning to the Yara/Asha and Pyke storylines, but I have the sense that a lot of unsullied are going to be saying, "Wait, now who are these guys again?"
4937	hedgeknight001	2014-04-30	They get to the Eyrie in this episode based on the promo, so I expect "Alayne" will come up then.
Â 
There's absolutely no way they could do anything remotely resembling Sansa's book plot without hiding her identity.

No, the issue is if Sansa's identity is to be hidden, then why does she still look like Sansa in the promo.
(Realizing, of course, that Sansa could not be revealed as Cersei and Tywin would demand her return.)
4938	Koi No Yokan	2014-04-30	And Tywin stressed to Oberyn that the Greyjoys "are in open rebellion." They have to be returning to the Yara/Asha and Pyke storylines, but I have the sense that a lot of unsullied are going to be saying, "Wait, now who are these guys again?"


Â 
It would make the Ironborn (re)introduction a lot easier if Asha is returned to Pyke to set up that arc (as I would assume they'd do the same with Dorne, by having Ellaria introduce Doran and Arianne). But I still think they could get by without her. Have an establishing shot of Pyke with the Greyjoy sigil in the foreground, then Victarion (or whomever) says "Balon Greyjoy is dead. His children Theon and Yara are lost", etc.
Â 
Will be interesting, regardless! I really hope Asha makes it back to Pyke for the Kingsmoot, but I have a feeling she won't be returning.
4939	Konradsmith	2014-04-30	Yara's debut in S4 will likely just be her attack. I think that's a strong choice because, other than getting to know her better, time spent aboard her sailboat as she made her long trip could be better spent elsewhere (as they've done). I had thought that she'd be added to the main cast and that she'd have her own storyline now, given how things played out in "Mhysa" but I think what they've done has worked. I still haven't figured out how she could possibly extricate herself from the position she's sure to end up in when the attack fails, but if she does return to Pyke people will like her enough to be willing to follow what she gets up to there. Even failing to take on the Boltons will boost her standing among the less-attentive fans.
Â 
I imagine what we get ofÂ Pyke in S5 will be pretty bare-bones though. We'll see the Ironborn only as much as is necessary to make it apparent that Vic is going to Meereen and Yara(sha) is going where Stan can capture her. Also enough to establish that Euron is a creepy fuck and potential future threat to Dany (and likely everyone in Westeros).

4942	Father of Dragons	2014-04-30	I'm sure I've seen in a trailer or a featurette somewhere a shot of Tyrion and Jaime walking down a dark tunnel, with Jaime holding the torch. Does this mean Varys isn't involved in the escape? That he will just remain in King's Landing of Conleth Hill's* sake? Or will he be waiting at a ship to take Tyrion across and introduce him? I can't work it out but I'm sure he wasn't there.
*I just realised that Conleth Hill must be a bastard from the WesterlandsAnd Jaime (and presumably Bronn) early next season. King's Landing will turn into the Cersei / Margeary show, with some helpings of Pycelle and Qyburn.

Â 
Theory: She sees Theon help Ramsay kill the ironborn in Moat Cailin, gets the information that Balon has died and decide to move back. It seems weird to me that she's already in the greenlands, considering Stannis will capture her in about S06.

Â 


I'm half-expecting a "flashback" episode where we revisit lots of scenes from Varys's perspective: he's showing Oberyn the way to the brothel early in the morning of their first arrival, he's getting Shae off the ship, he's sneaking the poison into the cup, he's lighting a flare so Dontos can find the ship in all that fog, he's showing Margaery the way into Tommen's bedroom, he's stuffing carrots down Pod's trousers for Tyrion, he's tossing Ser Pounce up onto the bed, he's secretly measuring Brienne for her armour, he's passing Tyrion's axe on to Bronn, and who knows what else.
Â 
OK, I'm not really expecting that in the least, although I can dream.
Â 
Oh, on next week: I assumeÂ one of assassin-drunken-Hamlet and Locke will die, but I doubt they'll kill them both off in the same episode. My money's on the former's death. Locke has some kind of ironic-punishment-death-by-White-Walker fate I suspect, but not before he can menace Bran a little more. (Or does he get to become a wight who loses his hand yet keeps on shuffling?)
4950	Annara Snow	2014-04-30	No, the issue is if Sansa's identity is to be hidden, then why does she still look like Sansa in the promo.
(Realizing, of course, that Sansa could not be revealed as Cersei and Tywin would demand her return.)Because the show runners think that a lot of the audience wouldn't recognize her otherwise? This show has never been known known to overestimate its audience (Asha/Osha/Yara, Robert/Robin etc.). And maybe they are even right about it - some of the casual viewers supposedly know Sansa only as "ginger Stark".
The other reason may be that Sophie, as a natural blonde, would look too obviously dyed with dark hair, which may be why her hair is lighter than Michelle's/Catelyn's in the first place.

Â 
I think they could pull it off if they had a scene where LF or Lysa (like in the books) tells her to dye her hair. We may not get it though, or maybe not until next season. Good point about Michelle's hair...Sophie dying her hair brown would actually make her lookÂ more like Cat.

It wouldn't make any sense for her to dye her hair after coming to the Eyrie and being seen by a bunch of people.

4953	Asshat by the Shadow	2014-04-30	After having so many characters clogging up King's Landing at the start of the season, there's been a fairly decent mass exodus thusfar:
Â 
Joffrey
Brienne
Pod
Olenna
Sansa
Dontos
Â 
gone.
Â 
With Oberyn, Tywin, Shae, Varys and Tyrion still to go by the end of the season.


Â 
Leaving Cersei, Jaime, Tommen, Mace, Margaery, Pycelle, and Qyburn. I'm kinda hoping with the reduction of characters,, we'll see less of King's landing in the future, and they start treating Meereen like the new KL. I think one of the biggest drawbacks to how the show is treating Dany's story is she gets maybe one scene per episode, she makes a big speech, and everything goes her way. With Tyrion, Quentyn, and Victarion heading her way, I hope Meereen actually becomes a focal point in the show, with us seeing more of Hizdahr, Ben Plumm, Reznak, the Green Grace, maybe a reintroduction of Quaithe, etc... I feel like that story could be more interesting than the book if they actually spend time developing those characters the same way they do Varys, littlefinger, and other "court" characters from KL.
4954	Hangover of the Morning	2014-04-30	Why is the dying of Sansa's hair so crucial? That is something that works in the book, where we only go by description, but IMO won't work on a visual medium. I think the viewers would find it stupid that Sansa is now unrecognizable because she changed her hair from auburn to chestnut.
Â 
Same reason why it made no sense to have Barristan pretend to be Arstan.

Barristan/Arstan is entirely different, since that is meant to fool the audience, whereas Sansa's disguise would not.
Â 
Her dyeing her hair isn't crucial, though it makes nobody wondering who she is even less plausible.Â  What's being debated here is whether the show could abandon the Alayne disguise entirely (no, they couldn't) and whether she might dye her hair at some later date.

Â 
Good points. Thanks for clarifying. I do hope (and believe that) they won't abandon the Alayne storyline. The dyeing of hair won't serve any purpose IMO. The audience would assume (or will be told) that none of the Vale lords have ever met Sansa so if Baelish tells them that Sansa is his bastard daughter that is what they were going to believe. And should they have any doubts, it'd be because they don't trust LF or find it odd that they never heard of Alayne before, not because she is ginger.
4957	Waxfoot	2014-04-30	Â 
Oh, on next week: I assumeÂ one of assassin-drunken-Hamlet and Locke will die, but I doubt they'll kill them both off in the same episode. My money's on the former's death. Locke has some kind of ironic-punishment-death-by-White-Walker fate I suspect, but not before he can menace Bran a little more. (Or does he get to become a wight who loses his hand yet keeps on shuffling?)

I think Locke might well be the guy who stabs Jon, instead of the Kettleblack. Seems they're angling for Locke to get close to Jon and betray him, and that could be it, not just hunting Bran.
4958	Talking Hodor	2014-04-30	Tommen will probably have his coronation here.
Â 
I also predict Jojen will spill the beans to Jon about his parentage, something his father probably told him.Â  Jon Targaryen, "First of His Name."
4959	Colonel Green	2014-04-30	I also predict Jojen will spill the beans to Jon about his parentage, something his father probably told him.Â  Jon Targaryen, "First of His Name."


Why on earth would the show, which has to this point eschewed that sort of foreshadowing entirely, suddenly drop the whole reveal into the narrative well before it (potentially) will happen in the books, when it has no impact on Jon's plot for the foreseeable future?
4960	FalseKnight	2014-04-30	The "Only Cat" scene, if it does not happen in the finale, will most likely be in episode 7 or 8. They wouldn't have it as soon as they arrive. 
My only concern is that they'll just give away the fact that Lysa poisioned Jon. She says "What wife would do for you what I've done for you?"
I assume she'll be saying this when it's just her and Littlefinger and not in front of anyone, so it'll be like a Varys/Littlefinger conversation, or a Margaery/Olenna one like last episode.
As Colonel Green said, Robin will appear on episode 7, and it seems wrong to have scenes with him without his mother in at least one.
This makes me sound skeptical, but no matter what happens, I'm really looking forward to the Eyrie scenes

At least they wouldn't have to show her breastfeeding him.
4961	ViennaGirl	2014-04-30	Â 
I also predict Jojen will spill the beans to Jon about his parentage, something his father probably told him.Â  Jon Targaryen, "First of His Name


Â 
Oh, I sincerely hope not. I want to find that out in the book, not the show...
4962	Dany's Silver	2014-04-30	And Jaime (and presumably Bronn) early next season. King's Landing will turn into the Cersei / Margeary show, with some helpings of Pycelle and Qyburn.




I wonder if they'll find a way to keep Varys somehow in the show for season 5.Â 
Â 
But we havent seen much of him so far this season. We know he has a scene with Oberyn in the Throne Room (looking forward to that one). He will testify at the trial, most likely and appear at the end of the season, but do we know (from promos) with who he might share other scenes ?


I will really miss Varys' character (as I did in the books), but the reveal of Pycelle's and Kevan's deaths at the end of S5 will make his absence worth it.Â  I am, of course, assuming that they won't drastically speed up timelines and that that material will be in the S5 finale.
Â 


I think Locke might well be the guy who stabs Jon, instead of the Kettleblack. Seems they're angling for Locke to get close to Jon and betray him, and that could be it, not just hunting Bran.


I honestly can't see him fulfilling the Kettleblack role, because he is Roose Bolton's catspaw, not Cersei's.

Given the Night's King scene, the Jaime raping Cersei scene, and the Arya killing Poliver scene, I think D&D want to answer some questions and move the plot. They want to send GRRM a message that he should finish the damn books. We have had 80 damn R+L=J threads. Someone should confirm or deny it.

4967	kjm16216	2014-04-30	I hope Ghost and Summer get free, approach Rast by having one of them sneak behind his legs while the other pushes him over, they tear off his face, piss on his corpse and then jump up really high in the air for a direwolf high-five.Â  Then Ghost can look at the camera, say "Who's thirsty now, motherfucker?", wink and Summer and him can laugh their asses off. Credits roll with "Won't Get Fooled Again" playing at full blast.


Dude, you have to put "spoiler alert" before something like this!!
Â 
Has anyone considered putting Sansa in a wig?Â  it accomplishes a disguise, but allows the show to visually flip her back and forth between Sansa and her alias, the way GRRM does in the books.Â  The disguise isn't just about hiding her, its about repressing her nature and manipulating it by LF.
Â 
I am also pulling for the theory that Jon makes the promise that Sam makes in the books.Â  I see Locke - Bolton's lackey - being sent to CB because its one logical place for the Stark kids to flee.Â  I see him sticking close to Jon because that's where he thinks Bran and Rickon are going.Â  I see Bran making an escape during the confusion of the attack, and Locke being killed by either Jon or Coldhands (or Summer/Ghost) to save Bran.Â  Jon sees the danger Bran is in if anyone knows he's alive, and swears to keep it a secret that he didn't die there, all in one neat package.
Â 
I don't see them suddenly busting out R+L=J this season.Â  Why would they?Â  If they want to foreshadow some things, Jojen can tell him that his father Howland Reed knows, or just that Ned wasn't his father, or even just to say his mother was high born.Â  There are other ways to reveal this.Â  Howland Reed was there, or I suspect that Septa Lenore - who we might not meet for another whole season - is Wylla, the wetnurse.
Â 
First of his name is Danerys queen of Mereen and Tommen king of the seven kingdoms.
Â 
He's a little young to know how to rub one out when Margery left.Â  But he definitely felt a little funny.Â  Like when he had to climb the rope in gym class.
Â 
I think the WW are going away for a while on TV.Â  They foreshadowed Night's King, which is both a WoW spoiler and conveying the story being told by Bran on his trip north of the wall.Â  Once the NW busts up the mutineers at the keep, it is back to the wall to defend against the wildlings.

This never occurred to me, but I like this bit of speculation.
4972	darksellsword	2014-04-30	The first thing I thought after watching last weeks episode was , they are going to reveal who Jon's parents are it has been building up since the first episode with Oberyn Â stating that Rhaegar started a war over "another woman" this is the first comment on the show that suggests he betrayed his marriage vowes for Lyanna Stark up until that point Â the viewers only knew that he kidnapped her.The second sign of a build up to the reveal was Jon saying "my father was high born my mother,,,,was not".I had no idea of what the title of the next episode would be before coming here and finding out its practically Jon Targaryen first of his name. am I wrong in thinking they've never given a title of an episode that is untrue in the way first of his name would be untrue when referring to Tommen as he isn't even the second of the name Lannister. I can't see them saying the words Tommen first of his name in the coronation most of the titles have been taken from something that has actually been said in that episode or a truthful narrative as far as I am aware. I will be watching the Tommen coronation scene and if no one in the actual scene says the words first of his name then I will know its about Jon.
4973	kjm16216	2014-04-30	Here's what I'm what I'm hoping they do as far Jon's warging goes:
Â 
Jon is the closest thing the show has to a tradiotional hero. When he gets stabbed, show watchers are going to freak out. I'd like for the camera to sit on his 'dead' body and then slowly move towards his eyes to reveal that they've gone wight like Orell's and Bran's so his warging ability can be a big twist for show watchers.

Tommen Baratheon is the first of his name.
I know he's a Lannister, and you know he's a Lannister, half of Westeros knows he's a Lannister, but officially and definitely regnally, he's Tommen Baratheon.
Come to think of it, he's not a Lannister, he's a bastard.Â  Tommen Hill.

Petyr better remember himself on his wedding night and not call out "Cat! Oh Cat!!" Of course, if they could completely skip that bedding ceremony, I would greatly appreciate it! Â 
Â 
In AFFC, Sansa is very concerned that Bronze Yohn Royce recognizes her, so it'll be interesting to see how the Lords Declarant in the Vale respond to Sansa's presence.Â  Perhaps Lysa will forbid Sansa's (Alayne Stone's) presence at her wedding, since this happens in the Vale, rather than the Fingers?Â  That way, she won't be considered a prominent person when the Lords (and Lady Waynwood) come to the Vale in S5 after Lysa's death.Â  I could see the Lords Declarant accepting an explanation from LF that the presence of his bastard would upset his lady wife during their nuptials, so she was left off the guest list.Â  Just speculation, because I doubt she'll actually miss the wedding, but it will be interesting to see how they pull it off.Â

Thats why I was wondering have the titles told us something in a narative sense like they did with bastards cripples and broken things Â but as an untruth like we know Tommen first of his name to be. I don't think they have with the exception of the Lord snow episode title but that may have just been because thorn was calling him that all the time as mockery. for example they've never given us a Â title like the last dragon Â for the episode in which Visery's was killed.even though it would of been exactly how Visery's percieved himself.

I still agree with my sister bastard. While there may have been other Daenerys, have any of them ever held the Iron Throne? I can't recall atm. So Daeneyrs would be the first of her name to hold the throne (so to say).

Not that we really did to argue about that. I think its clearly a nod to Tommen being named King

I really don't want to be a smart arse about this but its pretty clear that its a statement of being the heir to a family name , who really cares if a person is the first person to have a certain name Â .I'm sure there have not only been other Daenerys but some of them would of been Queens as well. There may have even been Â another king Tommen Lannister that dates back to before Aegon conquered Westeros. There are very few original names . I accept your opinion that the title is about Tommen being named king.

I thought it was ridiculous in the book as well. When Lysa first suggested cutting or dying Sansa's hair, I came to the conclusion that it was because she was onto Petyr and wanted Sansa to look less like Cat and therefore less tempting.
Â 
Having them actually carry through with it because having red hair = irrefutable proof of Tully lineage and Sansa's identity was hard to swallow.
Â 
If they do chane her hair color, mayhaps let Sophie show her natural coloring to save time?
Hair color is not a proof of anything, I just thought that the reasoning was "Petyr Baelish's dark haired bastard daughter appears at the same time that Sansa goes missing" would be a tiny bit less suspicious than "Petyr Baelish's auburn haired bastard daughter appears at the same time Sansa goes missing. "
However, it's not a big deal; the Unsullied won't be wondering why she isn't dying her hair - I don't think it's been established how good, if any, hair dye exists in-universe, and there can be other reasons not to do it in-universe; dark hair may not look convincingly natural on her (blonde makes little sense since it would make her look even less like her "father"), she may run out of hair dye or someone may notice the roots showing - and a bastard daughter with dyed hair would look more suspicious than ginger bastard daughter. (And if it's supposed to be a Tully trait, would anyone be surprised that LF went for a woman with similar hair colour to Cat?)
Tyrion never tried to dye his hair or otherwise change his appearance to pass as Yollo/Hugor, and he should be far more recognizable than Sansa.
4991	Winterfell's Revenge	2014-04-30	The melee at Crasters should be pretty cool.
Â 
I think Jon will kill Karl. Probably will put his sword through his face.
Â 
Hopefully Ghost kills Rast.


Â 
That's exactly what I hope to see as well!
4992	Annara Snow	2014-04-30	nah you are wrong it means the heir to his /hers family name
just as Daeneyrs states she is the first of her name even though there have been
many Daenerys before her she is referring to the name Targaryen.Because there was never a ruling queen Daenerys. 
So, how do you explain Maekar? He was obviously not the first Targaryen king. Neither is Dany the first Targaryen monarch, for that matter.

4993	Seneti	2014-04-30	Many episode titles have had double meanings. The obvious one for this title is Tommen. I can't really think of a secondary one - first I thought it was a reference to Balon, and that he would die in this episode, but according to the wiki he is the ninth Balon to be king of the Iron Islands. It can't be Euron either, in case they'd decide to skip the whole Kingsmoot and just introduce and crown him in the same episode as Balon dies, since he is the third Euron.
Â 
If Balon dies in this episode it could be a reference to Theon - someone might make an offhand remark that if Theon wasn't disinherited he would have been the first of his name. But that seems a bit contrived.
Â 
Daenerys is probably the first Daenerys to rule Meereen, but that's not his name.


Â 
Well, we know it will definitely refer to Tommen. Other potential candidates:
Â 
Jon (if R+L=J is true and we get some hints from Jojen/Bran)
Mance (first King beyond the Wall ?)
Â

Â 


Â 
Interesting theory. I approve.
Â 


Â 
Nah I think that Anthony Head would be better for Randyll Tarly. He is familiar with the asshole father role.Â 


Â 
Oh god yes... Not to mention he has casual evil down to a T (see his appearance on Doctor Who...)
Â 


Oh yeah and Dany finally changed her dress! There is a contingent of fans whoÂ are annoyedÂ that certain characters never change their costumes. This is for you all.
Â 
No such luck for Arya though. She's in the same jerkin still. At least in Braavos she'll likely need a different outfit. Poor Maisie.


Â 
With Arya the lack of dress changes actually makes sense. She's on the run and doesn't have time to buy new dresses and all the clothes she could find along the road would probably be blood-soaked, half-burned jerkins off dead bodies... I would really like to see Dany wear some Targaryen colors, though. Or a tokar at least...
Â 


Why is the dying of Sansa's hair so crucial? That is something that works in the book, where we only go by description, but IMO won't work on a visual medium. I think the viewers would find it stupid that Sansa is now unrecognizable because she changed her hair from auburn to chestnut.
Â 
Same reason why it made no sense to have Barristan pretend to be Arstan.


Â 
Actually, characters with ridiculously easy to see through disguises that still work miraculously have been a thing in TV since Superman and Clark Kent... But I agree that it might not be necessary for Sansa.

Â Where did you get this idea from ?
Â 
"First of his name" is just a fancy way of saying "the first"
Â 
Â 
So Aegon IV would have been Aegon Fourth of his name.
Â 
Â 
Also there is a difference between Queen wife of King and Queen ruler of country.
Â 
Â 
Elizabeth the First and Elizabeth the Second were Queens ruling the country in thier own right. That why they get numbers after their names.
Â 
However
Elizabeth the wife of Â Edward IV,
Elizabeth the wife of Henry VII
Elizabeth the wife of George VI were only Queen consorts and therefore they dont get a number after their names

5010	Cordelia Baratheon	2014-04-30	"First of his name" is nothing to do with their place in the family line. It refers to how many kings/queens regnant there have been before them.
Â 
Daenerys would be first of her name as she is a queen in her own right and there has never been another true Queen Daenerys who was "Queen Regnant", only "Queen Consorts".
Â 
Dany's claim is not based on her marital status therefore she would be Queen Regnant and as such is the first of her name.

1)Â  No, there's indication there was a Queen Daenerys.Â  The only other known Daenerys became the Princess consort of Dorne.
2)Â  Queens consort don't get regnal numbers.Â  Only the sovereigns do.Â  That's why Rhaenyra claimed to be Queen Rhaenyra, the First of Her Name, and her husband Prince Daemon was still just Daemon.
3)Â  The "First of His Name" stuff is just regnal numbering; Egg was "Aegon, the Fifth of His Name", for instance.

So many incorrect statements in one post:
Â 
1) no, they don't all marry their sisters. Several have married women from other families (Viserys I - twice, Daeron II, Aegon V, Jahaerys IIÂ  - those were just know for sure, they may have been others).
Â 
2) Daenerys is not the only female name in the family, and no, we don't know of any queens named Daenerys - in fact, the only other Daenerys we know of was the princess who married a Martell prince of Dorne.
Â 
3) Even if there have been other queen consorts named Daenerys, that makes no difference - none of them were ruling queens, as Daenerys is/would be. Only the ruling monarch gets to have the number after their name. Queen Elizabeth II is the Second because she's the second ruling monarch of England named Elizabeth. Her mother was also called Elizabeth and she was a queen, but she was not "Elizabeth the Second" because she was just queen consort and queen mother, not a ruling monarch in her own right.
Â 
4) Why would an heir be called 'the first of their name'? Where are you getting that from?

first of all I never meant to suggest that all Targaryens marry their sisters I Â was just emphasizing the fact that its a tradition
to marry their sisters and they keep their traditional family names .I am not sure how closely connected Georges writing is to wikipedia or
how accurate it is or if its supposed to be taken as the entirety of the Targaryen line . You dismiss the original Daenery's as only a Queen(princess) consort there are many cultures and monarchies that wouldn't
differentiate between a Queen by birth or a Queen through marriage especially if that queen had the same parents as the King. I have
my intepretation of what the phrase means you have yours. oh and btw I never said Daenerys was the only female name in the Targaryen house.

No, she was never a queen consort.Â  She was the princess consort of Dorne, married to Prince Maron Martell.
Â

so the Daenerys of ASOIAF shouldn't be claiming to be first of her name by your logic. I haven't read anything in the novels that show Queen consorts not having regal numbering it would serve the same purpose to differentiate between one Queen Naerys from another perhaps they are just defined by who they were married to because there hasn't been a need to number them yet anyway even with both interpretations of first of his./her name Â it could apply to Jon Targaryen unless someone is going to suggest there has already been a king with that name LOL.

I really don't know what to expect from Arya's storyline.Â  Something has to "kill" the Hound, and it's far from clear what.Â  I've been wondering if they're going to get into a fight with Ser Donnel Waynwood and his men at the Bloody Gate, because otherwise there doesn't seem to be anybody left.

Um, no.Â  Daenerys is the first queen of Westeros by that name.Â  The existence of a previous princess consort of one of its constituent parts means nothing.
5038	Konradsmith	2014-04-30	^That is likely because the guy they've cast as Waynwood is almost 6'5, so he could potentially take on Sandor. Also, in the weapons and training video we see a shot of some Knights of the Vale not long after seeing a shot of wounded Sandor and they look to be in the same locale (Icelandic cliffs standing in for the Vale). So either he takes some of them on or he helps them against Hill Tribes, but regardless, he does some killing in that neck of the woods.

5039	darksellsword	2014-04-30	I really don't know what to expect from Arya's storyline.Â  Something has to "kill" the Hound, and it's far from clear what.Â  I've been wondering if they're going to get into a fight with Ser Donnel Waynwood and his men at the Bloody Gate, because otherwise there doesn't seem to be anybody left.
Â 
Um, no.Â  Daenerys is the first queen of Westeros by that name.Â  The existence of a previous princess consort of one of its constituent parts means nothing.


To you it doesn't to me its very significant .I'm sorry some of you must of wasted a lot of money on a bogus Westerosi law school
5040	It's Not That Littlefinger	2014-04-30	Here's what I'm what I'm hoping they do as far Jon's warging goes:
Â 
Jon is the closest thing the show has to a tradiotional hero. When he gets stabbed, show watchers are going to freak out. I'd like for the camera to sit on his 'dead' body and then slowly move towards his eyes to reveal that they've gone wight like Orell's and Bran's so his warging ability can be a big twist for show watchers.


i like this idea a lot, but that would take away from the feels that accompany jon's "death" they could do that at the beginning of the next episode or something. that would work. it would give people at least a week of terror.
5041	iheartseverus	2014-04-30	^That is likely because the guy they've cast as Waynwood is almost 6'5, so he could potentially take on Sandor. Also, in the weapons and training video we see a shot of some Knights of the Vale not long after seeing a shot of wounded Sandor and they look to be in the same locale (Icelandic cliffs standing in for the Vale). So either he takes some of them on or he helps them against Hill Tribes, but regardless, he does some killing in that neck of the woods.


Who is the actor playing Waynwood?
5042	Konradsmith	2014-04-30	His name is Alisdair Simpson. They seem to actually have a picture of him in costume somehow on wicnet tumblr. He'll be appearing in "First of His Name" and then in an Alex Graves episode, likely "the Mountain and the Viper".

5043	~No One~	2014-04-30	I have the same suspicion - the taunting of the wolf will result in being devoured by said wolf.
Â 
I also think that it will be the direwolf gore that makes this scene "the disturbing scene they had to tone down".

Quick question...was that "tone down the gore" comment about ep. 5 or the one we just saw?? I was under the (mistaken????) impression that we'd already seen it? 
Anyone clear that up? Cheers

There's also a picture of Lady Waynwood and Bronze Yohn which looks legit because Anya's dress is in a very similar style to some of Lysa's outfits.

5057	Dany's Silver	2014-04-30	^ Remind me, in the books, what role does she play?


She's one of the Lords Declarant that comes calling after LF offs Lysa, because they're concerned about LF being Protector of the Vale until Robin comes of age.Â  I also recall that LF is able to win her over gradually by the promise of "Alayne Stone" marrying Harry the Heir.
5058	Arkash	2014-04-30	She is one of the Lord Declarants of the Vale, asking for the departure of Littlefinger. Later, Littlefinger pays the debts of House Waynwood, thus getting them in his pocket for her to allow Sansa to marry Harry the Heir who is her ward.Â

I can't think of a better moment for this than the episode right after the crucifixions. Plus, the Jorah tension should start soon, IMO.

5065	Konradsmith	2014-04-30	I think there are great moments in both books, iheartseverus, but they will certainly need to be honed down in order to make for palatable television. ADWD has a lot of good moments for TV in particular, but the fact that the battles of ice and fire were deferred until TWOW makes adapting it troublesome. I think keeping Varys around will be aÂ useful tool for making the Faegon and Dornish funny business easier to digest. If they play up his part in the Essosi intrigue by having him tag along with Tyrion and then have him broker whatever comes between Faegon and Arianne, it would seem less like it was coming out of the blue and more like this was up his sleeve all along.

5066	direwoofwoof	2014-04-30	I think Dany making it clear what she still needs to do before she can leave for Westeros is incredibly important. There should be some definitive milestone put out there (double the size of her army, get a certain number of allies, build x number of ships, have the dragons grow to a certain size etc) that tells the audience that she can't go yet. You can't just have her say "You know what? I feel obligated to stay and rule here indefinitely because it's my responsibility" because that's the kind of thing that pissed off everyone reading the book.

I'm one of those readers who was/is fed up with Dany dawdling. Her story in the books seems to be dragging on while the show is so fast paced. She needs to get on that dragon and get to KL!

How is that any different to the book readers, though? From LF's very first moment in AGOT you felt he wasn't trust-worthy, and by the time he betrayed Ned it was obvious he was a creepy, manipulative shit; it really didn't require much stretch of the imagination to believe he was pulling a few during the war thereafter. Hell, I know I'm not alone in thinking that LF was involved with Jon Arryn's poisoning until the reveal in ASOS. Anyway, I'm pretty sure LF "rescuing" Sansa was a surprise for Unsullied. Some might have seen it coming, others didn't - just like in the books.
Â 
His motivations and plans are still unclear in the show. Unsullied know that he wants power... just as book readers figured out pretty early on in the series.

5076	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-30	first of all I never meant to suggest that all Targaryens marry their sisters I Â was just emphasizing the fact that its a tradition
to marry their sisters and they keep their traditional family names .I am not sure how closely connected Georges writing is to wikipedia or
how accurate it is or if its supposed to be taken as the entirety of the Targaryen line . You dismiss the original Daenery's as only a Queen(princess) consort there are many cultures and monarchies that wouldn't
differentiate between a Queen by birth or a Queen through marriage especially if that queen had the same parents as the King. I have
my intepretation of what the phrase means you have yours. oh and btw I never said Daenerys was the only female name in the Targaryen house.

All the monarchies I know of, in fiction and in reality, differentiate between the ruler and the consort of a ruler...

So from what you know of throughout history in fiction and reality whenever a Queen or king through marriage is referred to they always specify that she/he is a consort?Thats not true it was one of the main reasons why Elisabeth I never married because whomever she would of married would have been considered the King.

5078	SerArthurHeath	2014-04-30	And yet she is not queen Cersei the first. She is the consort. Not the sovereign. And whilst what you say about Liz 1st is false. Her older sister, Mary, WAS married, to Philip II of Spain. Thereafter, she was STILL sovereign of England and now Queen consort of Spain, and Philip was King of Spain and Prince Consort of England. We may not specifically say Queen consort in a Game of thrones (unless you are Oberyn  ) or in real life , but anyone intelligent over the age of about 15 should still be able to tell the difference and I don't know anyone who thinks the current Phillip is Elizabeth II's son
5079	The Lizard King	2014-04-30	Here's what I'm what I'm hoping they do as far Jon's warging goes:

TLKÂ
5080	Colonel Green	2014-04-30	Thats not true it was one of the main reasons why Elisabeth I never married because whomever she would of married would have been considered the King.


Not true.Â  Marrying would simply have been politically destabilizing, and at a time when gender roles were so rigid, a husband would potentially have caused problems.Â  None of the English female monarchs' husbands have been called king, dating back to Matilda.Â  The same is true in Westeros, i.e., Prince Daemon, who was not called king.
Â 


So from what you know of throughout history in fiction and reality whenever a Queen or king through marriage is referred to they always specify that she/he is a consort?


It is generally not necessary to specify it, since people know who the monarch by birth is, as that's the sovereign (and also, among other things, the one who has a regnal number, which Cersei does not, for instance; nor Margaery, or Selyse).
5081	darksellsword	2014-04-30	Watching the promo were Jojen says to Bran "you must not let anything stop you" and then they show a moment of Hodor rocking back and forth. I take this as Jojen again telling Bran that he has to warg presumably Hodor , perhaps Bran expresses reservations about warging Hodor against his will, without the direwolves Hodor is the most powerful option for Bran. If they go with this scenario then its more than likely Bran and his group will be gone by the time Jon arrives. I hope not but its not a wish fulfillment show.

I must be misunderstanding you. William the Conqueror was William the first, as he was the first William. And he was never a king of Scotland, ever. Elizabeth 1 had already been preceded by a Queen marrying and still being the sovereign.
William the third never "conquered" England, he was invited and was the second in Scotland because Scotland had only had one king called William before not 2 like England, although this was an entitled separate King from either of those 2. He also co-reigned with Mary, which makes him unique but Mary was joint sovereign, not a consort. Also for other reasons lots of people didn't acknowledge William as their king at all.  If anything his example is evidence against your point
5086	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-01	Yeah. Sorry. Back to the thread, the title probably co-refers to Tommen and (despite "his") Dany but also maybe Stannis and an allusion to Jon. Oberyn might discuss Queening Myrcella too

Since several other posters here seem to dislike this line of discussion (though it does in fact relate to the episode title) I won't go into detail on this, but sufficed to say that absolutely none of this is correct, in the slightest.Â  Some astonishingly bad history.

After her scene/s(?) last season were cut, I'm looking forward to see Lysa again.Â  The actress was really good in the part, and the character has really stuck in viewers' memories in a way that even some of the main cast hasn't, based on online discussion, etc.

The episode title refers to the title of this upcoming HBO GoT episode, as you well know.Â  Not to the real-life history of the English monarchy.Â  As you well know.Â  There are many people here who are trying to enjoy their speculations about what we're going to see in the upcoming episode.Â  Do give them the courtesy of taking your side-discussion to its own thread.Â  Easy enough.

Â 


Oh, gods help us, this is back again!Â  Start a thread in General, seriously!!Â  Its childish and annoying as hell to the dozens (100s?) of people who're trying to discuss the upcoming episode in this thread!Â  Start your own thread to nitpick this side-issue to death if that makes you happy, it doesn't belong here, nobody wants it here, we're trying to discuss S04x5!Â  Start your own thread where it belongs and stop with the toddler nitpick back and forth here!


Â 
Agreed.
Â 


I just realized we might see this talk from the trailers:
Â 
Jorah: It's..tempting, to see your enemies as evil, but there is good and evil on both sides of every war ever fought.
Daenerys:Â Let the priests argue over good and evil. They can live in my new world, or die in their old one.
Â 
I can't think of a better moment for this than the episode right after the crucifixions. Plus, the Jorah tension should start soon, IMO.


Â 
Yeah. In between this and Jorah constantly being friendzoned, we should be getting quite some tension before the end of the season.
Â 


^I'm just impressed they remember who Jon Arryn was.


Â 
Same hereÂ  
Â 


Â 
How is that any different to the book readers, though? From LF's very first moment in AGOT you felt he wasn't trust-worthy, and by the time he betrayed Ned it was obvious he was a creepy, manipulative shit; it really didn't require much stretch of the imagination to believe he was pulling a few during the war thereafter. Hell, I know I'm not alone in thinking that LF was involved with Jon Arryn's poisoning until the reveal in ASOS. Anyway, I'm pretty sure LF "rescuing" Sansa was a surprise for Unsullied. Some might have seen it coming, others didn't - just like in the books.
Â 
His motivations and plans are still unclear in the show. Unsullied know that he wants power... just as book readers figured out pretty early on in the series.


Â 
This. I wasn't so much shocked by the fact that Baelish was behind it all, but I was amazed by how he did it.

5091	Mr Fixit	2014-05-01	So from what you know of throughout history in fiction and reality whenever a Queen or king through marriage is referred to they always specify that she/he is a consort?Thats not true it was one of the main reasons why Elisabeth I never married because whomever she would of married would have been considered the King. No one referred to Cersei by any other title than Queen when Robert was alive.


Â 
Please please please go to wikipedia and research Queen Regnant vs Queen Consort. Mighty please??????Â 
Â 
Please?
5092	Conchobar	2014-05-01	I am fairly certain that Locke is going to get ripped apart by wolves, instead of bears in the book.
5093	Arkash	2014-05-01	Everyone seems so sure Locke will bite it next episode but tbh that would surprise me. He hasnt done anything of significance yet to justify killing him. Now, if he were to attack Bran (who would eventually escape, thus making Jon believe he's dead and tying back to the book), kill Jojen, Karl, Dolorous Edd (please no !) or sabotage Jon's raid, that'd be another story !
Â 
That being said, I would love if he was teared apart by the wolves but I think this fate is reserved for Rast.
5094	The Dorne Ultimatum	2014-05-01	I'm 99% sure Only Cat is in finale.


Â 
Same. But I'm hoping it's a case of "be careful what you wish for", and the very last scene we see is LSH opening her hateful eyes, and the scene fading to black.
5095	kjm16216	2014-05-01	Rapists being flayed: Aye
Taking the regnal name/numbering discussion to its own thread: Double Aye
Â 
Totally believe they are ending the season with Only Cat.Â  The death on the toilet will be the Ep 9 closer, leaving all the unsullied to gasp.Â  Lyssa isn't as big a character, but its still shocking that it happens, so it makes for a good ep 10 close.Â  I think LSH will actually bump to next season and be the opening scene, before the title credits.
Â 
Does anyone know when HBO releases episode descriptions?Â  It seems they did the first 4 episodes before the season began but haven't released any more since.

The problem with the whole Locke trying to kidnap Bran plan is that Summer will straight fuck his shit up if he tries, similar to the assassin hired by Joff. I guess Roose neglected to tell Locke the boy has a giant Direwolf protecting him and that he'd need some backup lol.
5097	sati	2014-05-01	All this Locke talk makes me worried. So this Sunday not only do I need to pray for the glimpse of Stannis (that's a usual request) but also Locke's survival? Damn it.

Episode 9 will only focus on the Battle at the Wall (ala Blackwater).Â
5099	Dragonstoned	2014-05-01	Pretty sure one of the trailers had Locke at Castle Black at the end of the season, when Alliser Thorne does his epic 'tonight we fight', so safe to assume he lives for a while longer at least.

That's some other dude with a beard
5101	Dragonstoned	2014-05-01	Ah so it is. Â Worried for Locke now!
5102	oierem	2014-05-01	It's exciting that, as the season progresses, we are more and more in the dark about what will happen. Basically, the only storyline we now how is going to evolve is King's Landing. Almost everything else is in the air.
Â 
So, for this week, as we reach the middle of the season...
Â 
-KL. Last episode before the trial. Tommen's coronation and possibly Cersei's scene with Oberyn. Will this be the first episode without featuring Tyrion or does he receive another visit? By whom? Varys? I would really like to see him (and he does have a scene with Oberyn in the throne room -which, btw, hasn't appeared yet in the season). It's also possible that a Small Council meeting will happen in this episode. However, very possibly,this episode is going to be less focused on KL.
Â 
-Wall/Bran: finally these storylines will converge and it may very well be one of the focal points of the episode. Will Bran and Jon meet or at least see each other in the middle of the action? What will happen to Locke? How will Bran escape?
Â 
-Arya: her third appearance of the season. It seems to be basically filler as she travels with the Hound towards...
Â 
-Sansa: surprisingly, she already arrives to the Erye. Don't really know how this storyline is going to evolve in the following episodes.
Â 
-Dany: after all the victories, this is the episode in which things are goin to slow down and we will probably see some character development (Dany-Jorah-Daario triangle) and Dany finally facing some actual problems. She decides she stays in Meereen.
Â 
Overall, pretty focused episode, as all the previous ones (never more than 4 or 5 storylines per episode).
Surprisingly, it seems that Theon will be absent once again, as well as Stannis and Brienne.
5103	Trillian	2014-05-01	LSH is totally last scene of last episode material, like the White Walkers on season 1. I am tore about the toilet scene, because it does fits as stuff for an episode 9, but it also looks like ep 9 is very Wall focused.
Â 
I give Locke a few more episodes, it's Karl who's a goner.
5104	sati	2014-05-01	Ah so it is. Â Worried for Locke now!



I hope they keep him around, he is one of my favorite additions to the show and with them changing stuff around there is still so much potential for the character.
5105	DarkAndFullOfTurnips	2014-05-01	I think the reason why UnCat would make a brilliant last scene is because at the end of aSoS the story as we know it is kind of...over. And honestly it degrades as far as action/interest goes so the writers really have their work cut out for them for seasons 5 and 6. I think ending with UnCat will give the viewers a sense of "OMG What's going to happen now?!" Whereas by the end of S4 a lot of the storylines kind of end and go in very different directions, and many favorite characters' arcs separate from the other main characters (Arya, Tyrion, KL is left with just Cersei vs. Marg, Sansa own her own). It would be a good way to keep people excited for the upcoming season, I think.

Also as someone mentioned in this thread it's really cool with Tywin gone as the architect of RW and then the last scene - her being back. A very elegant way to show Lannisters finally having some real bad luck and Starks taking their revenge.
5107	kjm16216	2014-05-01	I've taken the liberty to (very) briefly summarize the chapters from ASOS that were not seen through season 3.Â  I've x'd the ones we've already seen in season 4.Â  This should help us all figure out what is next and happens when:
Jon VII CB under seige Â 
Daenerys V Hero of mereen x
Tyrion VII Shae angst x
Sansa IV Wedding gifts x
Tyrion VIII Purple wedding x
Sansa V Escape to boat x
Jon VIII Mance's first attack Â 
Arya XII Cat's body/Gift of mercy Â 
Tyrion IX Tyrion in jail Â 
Jamie VIII Jamie contemplating kingsguard Â 
Sansa VI Sansa now Alayne Â 
Jon IX Jon in ice cell Â 
Tyrion X Tyrion trial Â 
Danerys VI Danerys staying in Mereen Â 
Jamie IX jamie sends Brienne x
Jon X Stannis relieves siege Â 
Arya XIII Polliver/Valar Morghulis part
Sam IV CB Angst Â 
Jon XI Jon/Stannis Â 
Tyrion XI Tywin's Elvis Impression Â 
Sam V CB politics Â 
Jon XII Jon elected Â 
Sansa VII Only Cat Â 
Epi Lady Stone Heart Â 
Also to cover: Raid on Craster's, Coronation, Balon Greyjoy death
Obviously there is going to be a lot of filler: Margery visiting Tommen, Loras/Cersei getting back to main plot, etc.Â  But this is how I lay out the rest of the season for covering chapters.Â  I have asterisked the chapter that I think is the basis for the title of the ep.
5. First of His Name: Tyrion in jail, Raid on Craster's, Coronation*
6. Laws of Gods and Men: CB under seige, Cat's body/Gift of Mercy*
7. Mockingbird: Jamie contemplating Kingsguard, Jon in an ice cell, Sansa now Alayne*
8. The Mountain and the Viper: Mance's first attack, Tyrion on trial*, Stannis relieves siege
9. The Watchers on the Wall: Castle Black Angst*, Castle Black Politics*, Jon and Stannis, Tywin's Elvis impression
10. The Children: Danerys stayin in Mereen, Pollivar/Valar Morghulis, Jon elected, Only Cat

5108	MyLittleFinger	2014-05-01	Ser Barristan, with my 10,000 troops with no experience with aquatic invasion nor the different environment and who have won each battle through stealth and subterfuge without an actual fight, how easily on a scale of 1-10 can I take the Iron Throne with Blood and Fire?
Â 
My Queen...I'd give it a 1.
Â 
A 1?? BUT I AM THE BLOOD OF THE DRAGON!

Seriously lady, I think even Joffrey could lead the host himself and tear you to shreds...and he got punked by a 9 year old girl with a stick.
5109	darksellsword	2014-05-01	I must be misunderstanding you. William the Conqueror was William the first, as he was the first William. And he was never a king of Scotland, ever. Elizabeth 1 had already been preceded by a Queen marrying and still being the sovereign.
William the third never "conquered" England, he was invited and was the second in Scotland because Scotland had only had one king called William before not 2 like England, although this was an entitled separate King from either of those 2. He also co-reigned with Mary, which makes him unique but Mary was joint sovereign, not a consort. Also for other reasons lots of people didn't acknowledge William as their king at all. If anything his example is evidence against your point


You don't seem to have any clue what I'm talking about to be honest, Philip is Elizabeth II son who said that? anyway lets drop this now.

Same, would love it if they could keep Karl around longer too although it is clear he's kicking it next week, at least he basically got a scene to himself in the last ep and Jon taking him down will be a good watch.

Don't worry. The whole plot would be pointless if he just dies off randomly. It'd be like pulling a Quentyn. I doubt the show would do that.
Theory time: Bran meets Jon, and tells him that he musn't tell anyone he's alive. He says that Rickon ran off to the Umbers as well. Of course Locke overhears the talk about Rickon, and once they get back to Castle Black he has a new mission: to hunt down Ricky. Maybe he'll go to tell his Bolton masters, or maybe he'll just go straight for Rickon. Thoughts?

It could happen but that would be the second time He has overheard a valuable piece of information it would be a bit cartoonish for my tastes.

Yep, this is exactly what I was thinking. Especially because the actress who plays Osha has confirmed she shot at least one scene for this season, and I don't know who it could involve if not Locke coming after them.Â 
Â 
The one thing I'm not sure on is how he's going to leave without taking care of Jon (with Bran, I feel like he will realize Bran and co. are heading further north and just feel like the situation will take care of itself). Maybe he will decide he actually likes Jon and doesn't care what Ramsay said about him being a possible Stark threat?

Â 
I think in the show they are headed for the Umbers, right?Â  And Davvos is sent to look for them in Skagos.Â  They could do a scene of them arriving at the Umbers, finding Lannister or Bolton guardsmen there looking for them, and her setting off for Skagos.

Â 
I can see this happening. In the books, Manderly learns from Pyke that the boys are alive and that Rickon headed off. In the show all the Ironborn died at Winterfell. So for Manderly to learn of Rickon and to send Davos after him, he would have to capture someone else, ie Locke.
5119	Hath4	2014-05-01	Yeah in the end it could be Locke who tells manderly bran and rickon are still alive.
5120	ChillinLikeSerIlyn	2014-05-01	As I said, I think Bran will tell Jon to keep his living a secret. Which means Jon isn't a problem either.


Â 
Well, I don't see how this makes Jon not a problem. Ramsay said they should eliminate him because he could be a Stark threat if legitimized (clearly thinking from his own perspective of wanting to be legitimized a Bolton). Jon not telling anyone that Bran is alive has no effect on this threat, especially if most people think there are no trueborn heirs left.
5121	iheartseverus	2014-05-01	I just watched a ThroneCast interview with Thomas Brodie-Sangster over at WiC.Â  Interesting, in talking about JoJen's 'sight' of future events that may or may not happen, he mentions that in season 4, we will see snippets of what he is seeing in his visions.Â  Can't wait!

I saw an interview with the guy playing Bran, and apparently we will be seeing Sean Bean again. Something about a scene that was filmed in season 1 but never used. Also he was apparently filming something for season 4 during 2013.

Â 
It can certainly be in this episode since I'm not sure where else it could fit. I think Bran and co will only appear in one other episode (my bet's on episode 7) before the finale. Yet I could be surprised and they'll appear in two or three more episodes.

One of the first things we hear about direwolves is how easily they can take a man's arms off.  I want to see Rast lose his arms, damn it.
5129	ebevan91	2014-05-01	I'm kinda hoping Jon finds his warging ability since he may or may not be so close to Bran and the direwolves.

Ha, not me!Â  I want... intestines!Â  Long ropes of them being snarled and fought over by the DW Brothers while Rast is still alive and screaming.Â  That's what real wolves do, go for the soft underbelly first.Â  But whichever, ripping off his arms is good, too.Â  Either way is fine.Â  I'm easy to please!
Â
5131	ebevan91	2014-05-01	Maybe a scene involving the direwolves is the scene that had to be "toned down".

I like the direwolves more than Dany's dragons so I hope they get a good amount of screen time this season.

5135	ebevan91	2014-05-01	Isaac did say that in one interview but I think he may be incorrect. I can't see them dropping out that storyline for that long.


Â 
We do know some scenes get shifted around so it may be more like 5 episodes, maybe even 6 if it's a minor scene he's in.Â
5136	Dany's Silver	2014-05-01	What if its the Tower of Joy... Â  


I would love to see that.... but not until GRRM gives that to us (hopefully) in TWOW. 
Â 


There's only one thing I want to see this episode: Ghost and Summer playing tug of war with Rast's arms and ripping them right off. One of the first things we hear about direwolves is how easily they can take a man's arms off. I want to see Rast lose his arms, damn it.




Ha, not me!Â  I want... intestines!Â  Long ropes of them being snarled and fought over by the DW Brothers while Rast is still alive and screaming.Â  That's what real wolves do, go for the soft underbelly first.Â  But whichever, ripping off his arms is good, too.Â  Either way is fine.Â  I'm easy to please!
Â 
 


I could see Rast getting the intestinal treatment, but Locke loses an arm/hand while trying to harm Bran/Jon.
5137	Konradsmith	2014-05-01	^I hope so, that would be some solid karma. Is there a source or anything that confirms that Locke will lose his hand though?
5138	SM4e	2014-05-01	I imagined another theory on Locke: Maybe he will go after Bran & Co (who have already escaped when The NW arrives) and we only see him in episode 10 again. I don't know how exactly, but he might either be a weight already or will try to murder Bran. Hodor/Meera kills him. That would be so stupidly ironic: Jaime pushes Bran out of the window -> Locke cuts off Jaime's hand -> Bran('s company) kills the same guy who harmed the guy who harmed Bran. 
Also looking forward to Sansa aka Alayne Stone and aunt Lysa.
Did you guys know that Alayne is a wonderful allusion to the German word alleine, which translated means alone.
There're more of these allusions:
Stark is also German and means strong.Winterfell is German and means Winter fur.

It's just speculation (unless someone else has inside information) at this point, but it would definitely be karmic.Â  After what his actions in S3 (and especially what he tried to do to Brienne), I like to think Karma's gunnin' for Locke.
5141	Mel_Rose	2014-05-01	In the preview there is a scene (it is also in one of the trailers) of Bran crawling on the snow in the darkness. I guess they won't have bothered tying him up, so he could crawl away.
Â 
So I'm trying to figure where he might go and what he might do. I wonder if heÂ  unties Hodor or something. Or if he releases Ghost somehow. Or if by hiding, Jon thinks he's dead/gone.
Any ideas?

I saw an interview with the guy playing Bran, and apparently we will be seeing Sean Bean again. Something about a scene that was filmed in season 1 but never used. Also he was apparently filming something for season 4 during 2013.

5148	Konradsmith	2014-05-01	Recap's posted on GoT youtube. I can't paste on AFOIAF for whatever reason, but yeah, looks like no Dreadfort or Dragonstone (sadly). We'll get Bran warging Hodor though (as some of us suspected) and an emphasis on the Eyrie and the Dornish having Myrcella. And of course on Tommen.

Bring it here?
5151	King Tommen	2014-05-01	Based on "Previously On" recap:
Â 
Looks like Bran's definitely warging into Hodor again at Crasters
They brought up Myrcella again and how she's basically a hostage in Dorne which probably sets up a Cersei/Oberyn conversation
All the way back to the pilot to show the Lysa implicating the Lannister's in Jon Arryn's murder stuff so she and Petyr must fess up to it this episode
The start of the Brienne/Pod adventures on the road will be in this episode
And maybe Cersei is able to break up the Loras engagement since they reference that as well. Maybe Jaime gets him to join the KG
5152	Konradsmith	2014-05-01	Maybe we should start a newÂ thead for the recap? As I said I can't paste links here myself but someone else could.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 01 May 2014 - 02:46 PM.
5153	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-01	So Jon's assault on Craster's Keep, Bran warging into Hodor to escape capture, a lot of Cersei (scene with Tywin; scene with Oberyn), Tommen's coronation, and the beginning of Pod & Brienne's adventures, in addition to Littlefinger & Sansa arriving at the Eyrie.Â 
Â 
Should be a great episode. Really looking forward to the stuff up north, and the return to the Eyrie.Â 
Â 
Here's the recap, by the way:
Â 
https://www.youtube....h?v=hzOwdkUU5Mo
5154	King Tommen	2014-05-01	A ton of old footage in that clip: Ned, Cat and Luwin in the pilot episode, Lysa and Robin in the Vale in S1, Myrcella going to Dorne in S2, LF being sent to the Vale by Tywin in S3 and Bran warging into Hodor at Queenscrown in S3.

5155	Konradsmith	2014-05-01	I'm a little miffed that they've had the Dreadfort sit out for so long, but (given my thumbnail) that's just personal preference really.

5156	Dany's Silver	2014-05-01	This is the picture in question http://i.imgur.com/FouikVO.jpg


Wow. I had always imagined the scene where Brandon and Rickard died as horrible, but that picture makes me hope we some day see a young Kingslayer stick his sword through the Mad King's back!
5157	Mr Fixit	2014-05-01	I'd imagine that it's this scene...
Â 
http://gameofthrones...Son_of_Rickard)
Â 
(picture is further down the page; wouldn't allow me to link directly)


Â 
That would be wonderful, but it's not Ned in the picture. I can't imagine Isaac was that wrong. Was there another S1 cut scene?
5158	Father of Dragons	2014-05-01	I was hoping they'd save it for Only Cat, but it does seem like they'll have the "Who killed Jon" reveal this episode judging from the recap and Lysa's words on the preview: What wife would do for you the things I've done for you?"
In regards to the supposed Sean Bean appearance (of which I am skeptical), he may have shot a full scene (whether it's the Tower of Joy or whatever else) and we may see small snippets through Jojen (similar to Bran and the three-eyed crow in season 1) and then see the final reveal via Bran next year or perhaps even the year after that.
5159	Khal-a-bunga	2014-05-01	If it's any consolation, Konrad,Â I imagine we'll be getting a lot of Greyjoy/Bolton action in episode six.Â
5160	SM4e	2014-05-01	I always thought Martin called the castle Winterfell because it always felled winter. Defeats it every time due to the hot springs.


Â 
Assuming he alluded to winter fur, it would also mean that Winterfell is the most Northern safe place when the winter comes (like the winter-winter, not those winters that have been for centuries now).
5161	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-05-01	I'm a little miffed that they've had the Dreadfort sit out for so long, but (given my thumbnail) that's just personal preference really.


Yeah, but at least we have Locke representing the Boltons at the Wall, so they are not completely out the whole time.
5162	iheartseverus	2014-05-01	Maybe we should start a newÂ thead for the recap? As I said I can't paste links here myself but someone else could.


I started an 'Early Look at...' back on Monday--not approved yet, obviously.Â  So, this thread is the only one we've got for now.Â  I'll go look for the recap and bring it here.Â  We can always continue the discussion in the new thread if/when it gets approved.
5163	Benjaario Starkharis	2014-05-01	And am I the only one thinking they are trying too hard with these recaps? They basically spoil which topics will be addressed in the episode. Seeing Jon Arryn's murder conspiracy followed by Lysa and Littlefinger kinda makes it a bit obvious what the reveal will be.
5164	King Tommen	2014-05-01	If you're going to be dealing with something that was last discussed in a previous season, you pretty well have to show a clip of it before to refresh the audience's memory. Serialized shows do this all the time. And really, it's only a big deal to the book readers since it makes it that much easier to know what's coming up in the episode with the knowledge that we have already. A show viewer isn't really going to get too many clear hints on what's going on.
5165	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-01	I think you all are reading too much into it. Our first mention of Lysa is the letter scene, so of course they would show that and then follow it up with showing Lysa (and Littlefinger, because he's going to her).
Â 
Besides I really don't see how you can have the reveal without "Only Cat" - I reread the chapter yesterday and she reveals it ~2 paragraphs before Petyr pushes her out.

They don't need to kill her as soon as she reveals she was responsible for the murder. We can leave Sansa's POV in the show and watch private conversations between Lysa and Baelish. They'll probably expand their interactions.

Â 
https://www.youtube....h?v=hzOwdkUU5Mo
Â 
I'm guessing they included the shot of Myrcella because we'll see Oberyn in some tense Martell-Lannister confrontation this episode?Â  And they have to remind the audience that Myrcella is in Dornish hands?

Possibly, but I want Sansa to hear Lysa's confession firsthand.Â  Her reaction to LF pushing Lysa out the Moon Door needs to be following on the heels of the Jon Arryn poisoning reveal to have the most emotional impact on Sansa's character (not to mention that the Unsullied are going to have their minds blown - as I did the first time I read ASOS).
5169	King Tommen	2014-05-01	I think you all are reading too much into it. Our first mention of Lysa is the letter scene, so of course they would show that and then follow it up with showing Lysa (and Littlefinger, because he's going to her).

Â 
If they just wanted to tell you Lysa was coming back, they would have shown a clip of her (which they did). But on top of that, they played the entire clip from the pilot of Cat and Ned getting the letter from her about Jon Arryn's death along with a shot of dead Jon Arryn. That whole sequence doesn't even have Lysa in the scene. You don't bother to go back to the pilot unless you want to remind the audience of that conversation and that conversation is about Lysa telling the Starks about her husband being murdered.
Â 
We're getting the reveal in this episode.

5173	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-01	I'd like it if we got the Jon Arryn conspiracy reveal earlier than "Only Cat", especially if "Only Cat" will be sandwiched between Tyrion/Tywin and Lady Stoneheart. If you do that, most viewers wouldn't care who killed Jon Arryn because OMG TYWIN JUST DIED and OMG ZOMBIE CATELYN. The moment needs to have its own proper impact and placing it earlier in the season, in a quieter episode such as this, lets the audience appreciate it more and think about it over the week/while watching the following episodes (for marathon-watchers). Plus I like the idea of having little LF reveals throughout the season to show off how crazy calculating this guy is: "Early season = he killed Joffrey. Mid-season = he killed Arryn. Late season = he killed Lysa now, what!" This lets the reveal breathe and gives the audience time to contemplate how much of a player LF is. And, honestly, I don't think it's necessary in "Only Cat" considering the Jon Arryn reveal doesn't really pertain to Sansa.

5174	Konradsmith	2014-05-01	That's not necessarily the case, King Tommen, though it might be. Maybe we'll just have Lysa say to Sansa some shit about how she will soon be Tyrion's widow because Tyrion made her a widow or something in that vein.
Â 
BTW happy coronation.
Â 
Indeed, Ignorant Bog Woman, indeed. So we could hold out for some other surprise appearances from certain storylines. Though I think if Stannis were going to appear they would've reminded us about Davos's letter to the IB in the recap.

It's necessary in "Only Cat" because it'sÂ theÂ ending of ASOS. It belongs in the finale, which is why we are getting all this padding to make sure The Battle of the Wall, Tyrion's escape, etc. closes out the season just like those events closed out the book. The finale is set, in interviews, to be just really explosive of things that have built up all season. "Only Cat" included.
Â 
King Tommen,Â yes it's to remind the audience that Lysa has a husband that was mysteriously murdered. It makes no sense to me to take a climactic reveal and stuff it alongside the reintroduction of Lysa and The Vale, which is all that has to happen this episode. It baffles me as much as the R+L=J, First of His Name.

Â 
I likeÂ Konradsmith's suggestion. It's probably as simple as "hey, we'll both be widows! hey, we're all we have left, after the RW!" Cue Sansa crying to Lysa.Â 
Â 
edit: err, not both widows, but she'll relate widowhood to Sansa.

I disagree. I've always that felt ASOS had multiple endings, and never thought of Only Cat as "the definitive one" just because it occurred last. In fact, it was the weakest ending to me because I watched the show before reading the books and I already knew LF was bad business thanks to the heavy-handed portrayal of the character on the show. The Snow Winterfell scene was the highlight of the chapter and I thought Tywin's death, the reveal of Lady Stoneheart and Arya leaving Westeros were more engaging endings.
Â 
I'm not saying the reveal doesn't belong in the finale, I'm only saying I would understand if they revealed it earlier (and I'm expecting them to, based on the recap). There's also plenty of explosiveness in the finale without the reveal so the interviews are no confirmation.

Finally more Stannis, Davos, Theon, Roose(?), Asha/Yara; Damn, I see my favourites too little, I miss them so much! 
(Even though I know, of course, their great "time to shine" will come with Season 5, or respectively the end of 4, and they already add stuff for them).
If the scenes of Team Dragonstone and Team Dreadfort will be good, this episode has potential to become one of my favourites.
I think we will both enjoy "The Laws of Gods and Men" ;-)
Â 
(But I'm looking of course also forward to Ep. 5, especially to the reencounter with Lysa!)

It's necessary in "Only Cat" because it'sÂ theÂ ending of ASOS. It belongs in the finale, which is why we are getting all this padding to make sure The Battle of the Wall, Tyrion's escape, etc. closes out the season just like those events closed out the book. The finale is set, in interviews, to be just really explosive of things that have built up all season. "Only Cat" included.
Â 

Â 


Â 
Â 
In an interview that I read, it said this season would include the second half of book 3 and parts of book 4 and 5. So "Only Cat" doesn't have to be in the end. Not that it should tho. It could very well be in this episode however unlikely that is
5187	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-01	^Oh shit, you're right. I was forgetting his very brief appearance in 302.


Â 
That was my favourite scene this season so far! Alfie + Iwan + Michael: Soooo goooood 
Â 
Edited: Upps, I misread "402" instead of "302".

Yeah, but of the various parts of books 4 and 5 that will be included, it defies logic that Sansa's would be among them.

5191	oierem	2014-05-01	It's weird to think of Theon appearing less this season when he's got some actual plot.
Â 


Â 
Well,it seems that this year they're spending more time per episode in each location, making each episode tighter and more focused, with only 4 or 5 different storylines featured (D&D even said that was the case this year). Which means that some of the "lesser" storylines (Bran, Arya, Theon) will appear in less episodes than usual.
Â 
And in any case, Theon's plot for this year in minimal (not counting the invented attack by Yara), considering that they don't want him to reach Winterfell yet.
5192	SM4e	2014-05-01	I disagree. I've always that felt ASOS had multiple endings, and never thought of Only Cat as "the definitive one" just because it occurred last. In fact, it was the weakest ending to me because I watched the show before reading the books and I already knew LF was bad business thanks to the heavy-handed portrayal of the character on the show. The Snow Winterfell scene was the highlight of the chapter and I thought Tywin's death, the reveal of Lady Stoneheart and Arya leaving Westeros were more engaging endings.
Â 
I'm not saying the reveal doesn't belong in the finale, I'm only saying I would understand if they revealed it earlier (and I'm expecting them to, based on the recap). There's also plenty of explosiveness in the finale without the reveal so the interviews are no confirmation.


I pretty much felt it rounded up Act I of the saga. The War of The 5 Kings has ended, 3 hands of the king have passed away, but the conspirator is still alive and has not even reached his peak of manipulation. In Sansa's last chapter we get to know who is responsible for all the mess that has happened.
I do really hope this will be the second last scene. Then cut to Lady Stoneheart. It just looks amazing on the paper IMHO.

5193	oierem	2014-05-01	And am I the only one thinking they are trying too hard with these recaps? They basically spoil which topics will be addressed in the episode. Seeing Jon Arryn's murder conspiracy followed by Lysa and Littlefinger kinda makes it a bit obvious what the reveal will be.


Â 
I agree, and I'm glad that the recaps are not part of the actual episodes (and that the Unsullied don't watch them!).
It does spoil the surprises: for example, it's crystal clear to anybody that Bran will warg Hodor (which is a spoiler for both readers and non-readers).

You're also right (Somehow today I always misread or forget things  ), but I have a feeling that I will like 4x06 more than 4x02 (mainly because I find Stan&Davos in Braavos sounds way more appealing than Mel's burnings and I look forward to Braavos, Tycho and their arc now). The Dreadfort scenes will be always great certainly!

That's pretty weak. If it was a tweet from Aug 2013 and not 2012, then for sure. There's no good reason to shoot a scene a season ahead.
5204	Arkash	2014-05-01	I like that they use some kind of "PoV" system for the Lannisters at KL.
Â 
4x03 was Tywin. 4x04 was Jaime. 4x05 seems to be Cersei (looking forward to her scene with Oberyn).
Â 
Do we think Tyrion will get another visit this episode or will he skip the episode entirely ? (which would be a first apart from "The Rains of Castamere".) and if yes, who will come ? I dont see what character could visit him still ? Oberyn will be episode 7. Bronn will probably be 6 or 7 too (he has to refuse the trial by combat, so his visit should be after the trial).
Varys ? (doubt it). Tywin (doubt it) ?
Â 
I dont mind the Jon Arryn revelation to come earlier but I wish Sansa will be present to hear it. There are other ways to build up to the "Only Cat" in the finale than having the revelation.
Â 
So, confirmation that Bran will warg Hodor... so this gives credit to the theory that Bran might escape before Jon arrives, although I'd like Jon to believe Bran's dead once again (maybe the show will pull it that way).
Â 
Oh, and minor demand of mine for the episode : Dolorous Edd is among the raiding party. Please show, give us his full nickname and great lines for him !
5205	Konradsmith	2014-05-01	^He wasn't in "You Win or You Die" either IIRC. I'm sure they'll find a way to have him in "First of His Name" though.

That's interesting, but I don't think the Kings in the North ever styled themselves as the "First of His Name." I believe that's a Targaryen thing... Jon, on the other hand, is the First of His Name.

Stannis is not in this episode.
It refers to Tommen, who will be coronated in this episode.
5213	Konradsmith	2014-05-01	^We don't know 100% that Stannis won't appear, it's just likely. There may be a scene where Stannis says, "what's this letter from the IBOB?" and Dave says "I phoned those guys up" and Stan says "cool, let's go there". It doesn't seem too likely because it isn't referenced at all in the recap, but then neither is Dany or Arya's storylines. (But then those are in the promo and Stan isn't).
Â 
The True King will probably have quite a bit of screentime in episode six though, hell, he's even mentioned first in the summary for "The Laws of Gods and Men". Sounds promising.

Â 
The Stannis and 'Mycroft' meeting should be pure gold (ha!).Â  Stannis is all 'the crown is mine by right, nothing more to be said on the issue.'Â  While the Bank could give a flying crap about anybody's rights, their sole focus being who's best for their balance sheets.Â  Those two wonderful actors together in a scene will be something to see, indeed.
Â

It's called The First of His Name because Tommen I Baratheon, first of his name, is being crowned as the King of Westeros. 
Nobody cares about Stannis but the stans. Soon, sweet summer child. Soon the Stannis Stans will have their moment to cheer wildly while everyone else hears crickets.
5220	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-01	Â 
I'm just excited that we're finally going to see Asha kick some ass (or at the very least, involved!). She's always been a favourite of mine in the books just behind Jon and Arya, so I'm hoping she does have more of a presence in the show now that we're heading into AFFC/ADWD territory.
Â 
I really can't see where they're going with Asha's story arc, but I just hope it doesn't feel too contrived or wasted - and I'm sorta worried she'll become a tortured prisoner. Definitely excited though. I can live with her missing the Kingsmoot if she's going to slay some Bolton men (or a certain woman, for that matter). But seriously; if you rob me of the Theon/Asha reunion outside Winterfell's walls... dark days, indeed!


Yes I am also concerned with missing out on the Theon/Asha reunion outside of Winterfell. That was such an impactful moment for me in ADWD.Â
5221	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-01	I hope Braavos appears on the opening credits map. They're gonna have to animate it for next season, so I'm wondering if they have it done already. I wanna see the Titan pop up with a little wooden ship sailing under it.

5226	Seneti	2014-05-01	I just watched a ThroneCast interview with Thomas Brodie-Sangster over at WiC.Â  Interesting, in talking about JoJen's 'sight' of future events that may or may not happen, he mentions that in season 4, we will see snippets of what he is seeing in his visions.Â  Can't wait!


Â 
I agree. This should be awesome! If we're lucky, we might even get that at the start of the episode (begin with the vision and then see Jojen waking up/calming down again, leading us into the storyline beyond the wall).
Â 


Â 
I saw an interview with the guy playing Bran, and apparently we will be seeing Sean Bean again. Something about a scene that was filmed in season 1 but never used. Also he was apparently filming something for season 4 during 2013.


Â 
And that is even more interesting. Can't wait to see this.
Â 


If you're going to be dealing with something that was last discussed in a previous season, you pretty well have to show a clip of it before to refresh the audience's memory. Serialized shows do this all the time. And really, it's only a big deal to the book readers since it makes it that much easier to know what's coming up in the episode with the knowledge that we have already. A show viewer isn't really going to get too many clear hints on what's going on.


Â 
Exactly. Most casual viewers can barely remember the names of the main characters, so I doubt they'll be able to connect the dots here. Plus, and maybe this is just my own personal experience, in my family recaps were always more of a "breather" before the actual episode - you know, those one-and-a-half minutes where you quickly get yourself a drink and settle down on the couch before the real fun starts. We barely paid attention to them. (And if I hadn't read the books, I wouldn't.)
Â 
As for the recap, I am now looking forward to:
- Ghost tearing s*** up.
- Bran warging Hodor.
- Cersei speaking with Oberyn about Myrcella (giving us a good chance that Oberyn will mention his own little baby Snakes)
- Loras finally becoming a member of the King's Guard? (Cersei's first strike in her power struggle with Margaery?)
- Jon Arryn murder solved. And no, I don't think we will get "Only Cat" yet. That scene hinges not on Lysa revealing her secret, but on Lysa being super jealous of Sansa. So I think the Eyrie storyline will be like this: ep. 5 - Lysa's wedding + talk with Baelish (reinforcing that they are all liars), ep. 7 - Snow Castle and the beginning of Lysa's jealousy, ep. 10 - "Only Cat" (cut to LS)
5227	Mordos_Kull	2014-05-01	I assume we will get the Eyrie in the Opening Map next episode.

King's Landing -> Dragonstone -> Braavos -> Dreadfort -> Winterfell -> Wall -> (Meereen?)
Looks almost like Stannis' route from the beginning (Master of Ships in KL) to now. (Although of course attacking the Dreadfort was -luckily- only an idea of him and he was naturally first on The Wall and is now almost at Winterfell).
But I like this, it would also show (to only show watchers) that Braavos is actually between / on the way from Dragonstone to The Wall.
(Maybe the Eyrie will be there too, even if Sansa/LF/Lysa don't appear in an episode.)
5232	WTFSalami	2014-05-01	The only thing that could possibly make Stannis interesting is if he arrives at the Wall, crushes the wildling army, and then turns around and executes Jon Snow and destroys the Night's Watch, and orders the Wall to be torn down.Â 
Â 
Anything other than that is going to be nothing other than moving the world's biggest cunt from Dragonstone to the Nightfort.Â

Stannis Baratheon actually gets more unbearable and whiny and indignant and entitled the further North he goes. I'm not looking forward to next season.

Looks almost like Stannis' route from the beginning (Master of Ships in KL) to now. (Although of course attacking the Dreadfort was -luckily- only an idea of him and he was naturally first on The Wall and is now almost at Winterfell).
But I like this, it would also show (to only show watchers) that Braavos is actually between / on the way from Dragonstone to The Wall.
(Maybe the Eyrie will be there too, even if Sansa/LF/Lysa don't appear in an episode.)I think they will show braavos after the wall to emphasize the relative proximity,otherwise casual watchers will be confused that he could get there as quickly as he does
5239	WTFSalami	2014-05-01	Â 
To be fair you are coming across asÂ a little butthurt as Stan the man Baratheon stated.
Â 
It's one thing calling Stannis 'the worlds biggest cunt' (Joff or Cersei has that title)Â but an entirely other thing when you suggest he kills Jon to make him more interesting. Â  


Jon is a brooding Twilight vampfag with not a single interesting fiber of being. If Bruce Wayne never experienced ice cream, he'd be Jon Snow. Mopy bastard brehhhh.Â 
Â 
If Stannis killed Jon, he would immediately become my favorite character.Â
5240	iheartseverus	2014-05-01	@iheartseverus: "On the way" or "between" were maybe the wrong words, I just meant it's actually no real detour, if you already have to sail through the Narrow Sea from Dragonstone to the North, isn't it?


Ah, I see what you're saying.Â  Via sea voyage, it could be considered 'on the way.'Â  It'll be interesting to see how the opening credits handle this--my guess would be they'll hit all the Westeros sites first, including the Eyrie, and then swoop across the Sea to Braavos and then to Meereen.Â  But who knows?Â  Those opening credits are gorgeous, I look forward to them every week!
Â 
And here's a world map by the fabulous Other-In-Law to put the route in perspective.

5241	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-01	@iheartseverus (again): Oh, and I know many only show watchers who are confused with the positions of Essos' cities, because in the intro the camera panning to Meereen looks so different from that to Astapor/Yunkai/... . 
I think they don't know where exactly the Free Cities are, and that it's not totally the other side of the world. (Compared to other Essosi cities they have seen is Braavos not sooo far away;-)
5242	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-01	Â 
I agree. This should be awesome! If we're lucky, we might even get that at the start of the episode (begin with the vision and then see Jojen waking up/calming down again, leading us into the storyline beyond the wall).
Â 
Â 
And that is even more interesting. Can't wait to see this.
Â 
Â 
Exactly. Most casual viewers can barely remember the names of the main characters, so I doubt they'll be able to connect the dots here. Plus, and maybe this is just my own personal experience, in my family recaps were always more of a "breather" before the actual episode - you know, those one-and-a-half minutes where you quickly get yourself a drink and settle down on the couch before the real fun starts. We barely paid attention to them. (And if I hadn't read the books, I wouldn't.)
Â 
As for the recap, I am now looking forward to:
- Ghost tearing s*** up.
- Bran warging Hodor.
- Cersei speaking with Oberyn about Myrcella (giving us a good chance that Oberyn will mention his own little baby Snakes)
- Loras finally becoming a member of the King's Guard? (Cersei's first strike in her power struggle with Margaery?)
- Jon Arryn murder solved. And no, I don't think we will get "Only Cat" yet. That scene hinges not on Lysa revealing her secret, but on Lysa being super jealous of Sansa. So I think the Eyrie storyline will be like this: ep. 5 - Lysa's wedding + talk with Baelish (reinforcing that they are all liars), ep. 7 - Snow Castle and the beginning of Lysa's jealousy, ep. 10 - "Only Cat" (cut to LS)


Â 
it would be a horrible decision to split the snow castle and moon door sequence.
i am hoping it would go like this:
Â 
Ep. 5 - Reintroduce Lysa
Ep. 7 - Wedding
Ep. 10 - Only Cat

Â 
They don't even know where Dorne is. At least the hardcore Unsullied. Some of them think it is an island since Myrcella went there on a boat.
5244	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-01	@go joff go: Ah, that's also true... Maybe you're right, and they'll go this way. It would also fit to their idea of creating a surprise of Stannis' arrival (despite the events of 3x10), so your order would actually be the better (and less obvious) one!
5245	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-01	@iheartseverus (I'm writing on my mobile phone, so I can't quote, only use always "@..."): Yes, I meant via sea voyage ;-) 
And I also love the opening credits very much! My favourite show intro overall! I love the music, the places, the castle and this nice detail with the sigil-symbols by every name...
And this world map is wonderful cute! :3
5246	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-01	I've already said in the "Little questions that don't fit anywhere else" thread, if very attentive watchers (who also know the actors' names) read "Stephen Dillane", "Liam Cunningham" (if they'd change Davos' storyline a bit) and "Carice van Houten" in the opening credits, and then realize that that isn't a jumping-from-storyline-to-storyline-episode, they'll know that at one point Stannis & Co. will appear at the Wall :-(
... But since I realized that this show watchers are probably the minority I don't worry any longer about it.
5247	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-01	^ Oh, and I'm talking here about 4x09 (not 4x06)
5248	Colonel Green	2014-05-01	So I think the Eyrie storyline will be like this: ep. 5 - Lysa's wedding + talk with Baelish (reinforcing that they are all liars), ep. 7 - Snow Castle and the beginning of Lysa's jealousy, ep. 10 - "Only Cat" (cut to LS)


As dumb as I think it would be to put "Only Cat" in episode 7, it's infinitely preferable to have the Snow Castle and "Only Cat" in the same episode.Â  Separating them by three episodes would utterly, utterly deflate the dramatic tension in what is meant to be a single, tense series of events.Â  But they both belong in episode 10.
5249	Konradsmith	2014-05-01	^I think LF will be in episode eight as well, Colonel. in the "Directors" featurette we see a shot of him in a golden outfit being directed by Alex Graves. In the shot we have from the "On the Set" featurette where we see the blocking of the "Only Cat "moment, he's wearing something different. That leads me to believe that, either the big moment is in ep. 7, or he has scenes in both ep. eight and ten.
Â 
I think Robin being in episode ten (fromÂ imdb, which isÂ accurate when its specific agency-updated info rather than fan-edited info)Â though, might mean that "Only Cat" is indeed in the finale.

And here's a world map by the fabulous Other-In-Law to put the route in perspective.

http://imgur.com/3FD0TM3


The map sequence has to match a specific pattern (lenght-wise): KL, two locations that keep changing, Winterfell, Wall, East.
Very possibly, Dragonstone will be substituted by the Eyrie this week, but the Dreadfort will still appear so I'm afraid we won't see Braavos in the opening sequence this year, as it only appears in one episode.
5255	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	^So did the Twins in S1 and they still showed them IIRC.
5256	Kitakaze	2014-05-02	Don't know if this has been already predicted, but based on the books and Oathkeeper's direction of having Ghost caged and Summer injured and trapped, plus the antagonization of Hodor, I was thinking The First of His Name would be the first episode where Bran wargs Hodor during Jon's attack on Craster's Keep. Looking at the promo we see Hodor in chains about to rage. There's no effect on the eyes indicating warging as per usual with the show, so now I'm wondering if it's going to be Hodor himself going Hulk.
Â 
Hodor at the 00:22 mark...

							Edited by Kitakaze, 02 May 2014 - 02:41 AM.
5257	oierem	2014-05-02	^We don't know 100% that Stannis won't appear, it's just likely. There may be a scene where Stannis says, "what's this letter from the IBOB?" and Dave says "I phoned those guys up" and Stan says "cool, let's go there". It doesn't seem too likely because it isn't referenced at all in the recap, but then neither is Dany or Arya's storylines. (But then those are in the promo and Stan isn't).


Stannis won't appear, 100% sure.
-He's not in the promo.
-He's not in the recap. I know Arya and Dany are not in the recap, but in Arya's case, that's just because her scenes aren't part of any storyline (they will be basically filler scenes unrelated to what happened at the farm or in the inn) and in Dany's case, this episode basically starts from scratch, once all the conquests are over: new threats, new storylines... It's not a direct follow-up from the previous episode.
-There are already enought storylines appearing: KL, Jon-Bran, Sansa, Arya, Brienne, Danny. No episode features all the characters
5258	Waxfoot	2014-05-02	I hope Oberyn is back. I think he is, because he is in 7 episodes and his battle is in ep 8 so he only misses one. 
We need to see more of him I feel, his character feels so important in the books to the rich and complicated recent history of the iron throne. His death had more impact on me than RW or PW, because of the far-reaching consequences and events it sets in motion.
5259	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-02	The map sequence has to match a specific pattern (lenght-wise): KL, two locations that keep changing, Winterfell, Wall, East.

No, I think sometimes they have more locations. They speed the animations up to compensate for the longer time it would normally acquire.
5260	Arkash	2014-05-02	So, out of all the five storylines that we are supposed to get this episode :
Â 
- Everything North of the Wall is what I am most looking forward too.
- Closely followed by the arrival at the Eyrie.
- And the showdowns at KL (Cersei, Oberyn, coronation...)
Â 
Then, there is what I guess will be the shorter / filler scenes :
- Arya.
- Dany holding her council.
5261	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	Well, Dany was the first thing that was shown in the promo, so I'm not sure that it will be shorter necessarily. I think we'll have two or three scenes with her, beginning with her considering sailing to Westeros and ending with her choice "I will rule." For Arya I predict we'll get some sword-fight training and then them stumbling across the dying chap ("maybe nothing is better than this" from the Foreshadowing") which will lead to the "Gift of Mercy" scene.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 02 May 2014 - 03:53 AM.
5262	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-02	Dany's council scene will be important though, not filler. It's why she decides to stay in Meereen, whether you like or loathe that decision
5263	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	^I bet a lot of unsullied will be pissed off, but really what the fuck do they expect to happen? If she were to swoop in and win to great celebration etc. etc. etc. the show would be over. I hope they don't riot but her staying in Essos means the intrigue in Westeros can carry on.

5264	Stan the Man Baratheon	2014-05-02	D&D are evil. They are teasing Dany fans so badly. Some of them are starting believe she will invade Westeros soon, going by the preview.
5265	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	Maybe they'll come up with a rationalization for her staying that is more satisfying to them. Maybe they'll make her decision to rule Meereen somewhat more palatable to that brand of fan.

					
					
							Edited by Konradsmith, 02 May 2014 - 04:10 AM.
5266	oierem	2014-05-02	No, I think sometimes they have more locations. They speed the animations up to compensate for the longer time it would normally acquire.


No, if I remember correctly, they've never had more than 6 locations (including KL, Winterfell , Wall and East) in each opening sequence. In fact, starting with the second season the number of locations and the lenght of the title sequence has been exactly the same. Only in the first season there were actual variations in lenght and there were fewer locations shown.
5267	oierem	2014-05-02	So, out of all the five storylines that we are supposed to get this episode :
Â 
- Everything North of the Wall is what I am most looking forward too.
- Closely followed by the arrival at the Eyrie.
- And the showdowns at KL (Cersei, Oberyn, coronation...)
Â 
Then, there is what I guess will be the shorter / filler scenes :

Plus Brienne and Pod!
5268	oierem	2014-05-02	D&D are evil. They are teasing Dany fans so badly. Some of them are starting believe she will invade Westeros soon, going by the preview.


I doubt D&D are in charge of creating the previews.
5269	Duckface	2014-05-02	Do you think they will show Oberyn with a bunch of whores? We haven't seen of those whores much, looking forward to. Also, i'm hoping there will be at least 3 rape scenes.
5270	Arkash	2014-05-02	Please, enough sex scenes with Oberyn ! The character is so much more multi-dimensional than that !
Â

5274	Arry Lannister	2014-05-02	Plot twist: Pod's rod is Lightbringer.
Â 

So the scene with Pod having sex with all those whores was actually foreshadowing? I knew there was more to that scene. I personally believe that it was foreshadowing that Pod was the Stallion that mounts the world. Once Dany arrives at Kingslanding she will be immediately slain by Pod's rod.

Cleganeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hand shot up and grabbed the Dornishman behind the knee. The Red Viper
brought down the greatsword in a wild slash, but he was off-balance, and the edge did no
more than put another dent in the Mountainâ<U+0080><U+0099>s vambrace. Then the sword was forgotten
as Gregorâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hand tightened and twisted, yanking the Dornishman down on top of him.
They wrestled in the dust and blood, the broken spear wobbling back and forth. Tyrion
saw with horror that the Mountain had wrapped one huge arm around the prince,
drawing him tight against his chest, like a lover.

teeth. â<U+0080><U+009C>Then I smashed her fucking head in. Like this.â<U+0080><U+009D> As he drew back his huge fist, the
blood on his gauntlet seemed to smoke in the cold dawn air. There was a sickening
crunch. Ellaria Sand wailed in terror, and Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s breakfast came boiling back up. He
found himself on his knees retching bacon and sausage and applecakes, and that double
helping of fried eggs cooked up with onions and fiery Dornish peppers.

5302	Bran Snow	2014-05-02	Come on, that would be a great scene to see. It shows what a beast the Mountain is.

I'm sure they'll show it, just not in slow motion.
5304	Colonel Green	2014-05-02	HBO released a few photos for the episode:Â http://www.pajiba.co...hp#.U2O37PldV8F
Â 
Looks like we're getting side-eyeing Dany?


If they're going to be episode photos, they could stand to perhaps release something other than rather bland character shots.
5305	Father of Dragons	2014-05-02	I'm pretty sure they've changed Oberyn's death to being sliced in half. That's likely the shot we saw of Gregor in the trailer. And remember what Oberyn said to Tyrion in the premier? "The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane, the Mountain, raped Elia and split her in half with his greatsword."

Gregor isn't wearing any armor in that scene iirc. But in other scenes of the fight, he is. I think Gregor is cutting other people in half there.Â
5308	Carne	2014-05-02	He won't be cut in half, but I'll leave it at that. You'll see soon enough
5309	Arya2ndFace	2014-05-02	My guess is Ygritte, in that kind of "Boromir being filled with arrows" slow-mo style. If it's the Viper, that's going to make all of us lose our breakfasts (not just Tyrion).


Â 
I am thinking a slo-mo of a bolt heading for Tywin's gut while he's unloading on the crapper would make for a great scene.
5310	Father of Dragons	2014-05-02	Gregor isn't wearing any armor in that scene iirc. But in other scenes of the fight, he is. I think Gregor is cutting other people in half there.Ah, yes.
I had heard Gregor would be cutting people up, but when I saw these pictures I was sure it was Oberyn. Upon closer inspection, I was wrong.http://scifimonkeys....got-setpic8.jpghttp://scifimonkeys....got-setpic9.jpg
Also, the slo-mo death has got to be Ygritte

Â 
Yeah I was curious about that in the seasons trailer as well - you see the man kneel/beg in front of Gregor (with a others behind him) then the shot of shirtless Gregor swinging the sword... guess that's the 'man' in the photos there. Looks like the setting is the KL area to me.
Â 
Glad because as a friend pointed out - one of the cool parts of the trial is Gregors plate (which you also see in one of the previews) and Oberyn wearing him down to try and get a spear into one of the openings.
5314	Bran Snow	2014-05-02	I can see the slow-mo scene being the death on Ygritte. Jon watching as one arrow hits her, then another, she falls to her knees when the final arrow hits her in the chest. Its a way to make the death of Jon's first love more dramatic.
5315	iheartseverus	2014-05-02	In a GQ interview with Aiden Gillen about playing a villain, they use this image at the beginning of the article.Â  Have we seen this image before?Â  That hairdo and the jewel in her hair seem familiar, but I don't remember LF clapping his hand over her mouth.

Â 
agreed...im ok with them changing stuff which aren't described very clearly in the books...or D&D's take on a scene or perhaps the decision to just spice things up and make it grander... but viper vs mountain, i could picture every move...just from the first trailer for this season, watching viper spinning around horizontally, that was exactly how i pictured it...i hope they keep it identical and his death as gorey as possible
Â 
would be fun to see the unsullied reactions to it too since most of them think he's gona be the one to save the day

5326	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-02	Seeing Ned in Bran's vision counts as a flashback, no?

Yes I suppose that does count as a flashback...but I meant more on the lines of stuff that didn't happen in this time...stuff from the past like Raeghar vs. Robert or Lyanna's last words being "promise me Ned!" or Aerys Targareyn burning Ned's father...
Stuff that they mentioned in the book as memories of the characters.
Though I do remember in the book Bran seeing a baby Lyanna fighting Brandon or Ned...so I suppose Bran's visions will be the source of a lot of flashbacks

i would be more interested in LF's expression...just picture it -
Â 
LF completely stoic, calm, expressionless as he shoves, doesn't even glance back to see her fall, and slowly turns to look at sansa and just the slowly the barest hint of his trademark evil smile forms...
Â 
that is the kind of scene that would make meÂ

i completely forgot about those...
Â 
Ned (maybe blocked it out?)...but ya it was slow-mo and i would say it was from Ned's POV which justifies it...his beheading was the biggest moment at that time, very deserved scene for slow-mo, had half the people expecting someone to stop it or save him at the last moment....that moment has had the greatest consequences, entire north rising up against the Iron Throne
Â 
end of blackwater was Tyrion's POV, sort of near death experience, again super crucial moment...near death of everyone's favorite character and the arrival of Tywin to smash Stannis' army bad enough and solidifying Lannister hold on the Throne...effectively ending that rebellion...
Â 
Vipers death would fit in that perspective...the fight will be oberyn's POV, maybe Tyrions...similar to Ned's death, spark of the Dornish rebellion and seemingly sealing Tyrion's fate once and for all...
Â 
Lysa's while definitely a big shock, does not have that kind of significance to the general plot. though i suppose others will argue that it leads way to Sansa becoming heir of the Vale and Winterfell...
Â 
Ygritte's while being very emotional and devastating for Jon, it is personal only to him...in the books, doesnt he find her body after the battles done? did he actually witness her death? well, as much as it does suck for Jon, doesnt affect the story as a whole so i doubt that would be the one...
Â 
tywins...fits the bill perfectly...so eager to see if it is that one

if they do ygritte's they should do shae's too...tyrion loved her longer and shae's had more screen time than ygritte...
Â 
but thats what i was trying to say...they shouldn't do slow-mo for inconsequential or personal deaths...like the maester who tried to poison melisandre and chokes and dies in s2e1, dramatic, they took their time showing it and everyone's reaction to it, but no slow-mo...
5342	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-02	Well, now you mention Melisandre... What will she do the rest of the season? We know sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s certainly together with Stannis' host at Castle Black in 4.09 and Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m sure we will see her burning Orellâ<U+0080><U+0099>s eagle (Carice already said something about time on a horseback this season and a stunt woman / double) and as from 4.10 then, she stays with Jon & Co. at Castle Black.

I really hope it wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be an awkward Stannis / Mel farewell scene before the journey to Braavos, with Stannis gatecrash her taking a bath and seeing her naked andâ<U+0080>¦ *remembering beach scene*Â  Â  urg, No!
But she wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t show him her powders, so more likely a Mel-alone or Mel/Selyse scene? In an episode before 4.09? 4.05 / 4.06 / 4.07 / 4.08?

Â 
how about s4e6? a lot of the focus is gona be on tyrion's trial most likely, but maybe they could start off the ep with dragonstone and showing mel nude, bath, then getting dressed and going to her box of goodies and hiding them up her sleeves...then goes to see stannis/davos who are on their way to bravos or the wall...after that moves to tyrions trial maybe?Â 
Â 
better to get them out of the way early so focus can stay on Tyrions trial, LF, Arya through e6,7,8...
5345	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-02	I'd like it if we got the Jon Arryn conspiracy reveal earlier than "Only Cat", especially if "Only Cat" will be sandwiched between Tyrion/Tywin and Lady Stoneheart. If you do that, most viewers wouldn't care who killed Jon Arryn because OMG TYWIN JUST DIED and OMG ZOMBIE CATELYN. The moment needs to have its own proper impact and placing it earlier in the season, in a quieter episode such as this, lets the audience appreciate it more and think about it over the week/while watching the following episodes (for marathon-watchers). Plus I like the idea of having little LF reveals throughout the season to show off how crazy calculating this guy is: "Early season = he killed Joffrey. Mid-season = he killed Arryn. Late season = he killed Lysa now, what!" This lets the reveal breathe and gives the audience time to contemplate how much of a player LF is. And, honestly, I don't think it's necessary in "Only Cat" considering the Jon Arryn reveal doesn't really pertain to Sansa.
Â 
There's no Arya either.


Yea I think I'm with you on this. There is so much that's going to be going down in the last 3 episodes that I wouldn't mind a big moment like that getting pushed up.

Â 
wow, i would have loved to see this! i always wished they showed flashbacks in the show...but i guess they have tough enough time managing to get all the important parts in, showing flashbacks would take up too much time...but some rare moments like this i wish they did show! specially since GRRM is never finishing the 7th book on time
5347	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-02	I was sold on Lysa getting slo-mo until someone mentioned "Boromir mode" for Ygritte in a Neil Marshall directed episode. I can understand now, but I personally feel Ygritte's had insignificant presence this season just because of the way they've delayed wildlings attacking at all until Episode 9 and there's nothing else for them to do before that.
Â 
I think Lysa because a quick shove might partly ruin the gravitas of the scene. Maybe.
5348	Ankou	2014-05-02	Many episode titles have had double meanings. The obvious one for this title is Tommen. I can't really think of a secondary one - first I thought it was a reference to Balon, and that he would die in this episode, but according to the wiki he is the ninth Balon to be king of the Iron Islands. It can't be Euron either, in case they'd decide to skip the whole Kingsmoot and just introduce and crown him in the same episode as Balon dies, since he is the third Euron.
Â 
If Balon dies in this episode it could be a reference to Theon - someone might make an offhand remark that if Theon wasn't disinherited he would have been the first of his name. But that seems a bit contrived.
Â 
Daenerys is probably the first Daenerys to rule Meereen, but that's not his name.


Isn't it obviously Ramsay who will be legitimized this episode?Â
5349	iheartseverus	2014-05-02	I could see a scene with Lysa teetering after the shove, windmilling her arms around and looking terrified, and then....slo-mo just a couple of seconds as she falls backward.Â  Then, gone.
5350	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	I'm leaning towards something to do with Neil Marshall. I wonder why the article said they hadn't done slo-mo before when they clearly have. Most recently we got slo-mo when Tyrion was picking up Joff's cup and Cersei saw him in "the Lion and the Rose".

Â 
i agree that a lot of the the eps usually have double meanings...i didn't think about Ramsay because do the general people care about their name orders? i thought it was only reserved for kings....otherwise wouldn't "Bran be the 100th of his name of House Stark" or "Tyrion the First of his name of House Lannister"?Â 
Â 
Oathkeeper didn't necessarily have double meaning unless you are believe that crasters sister/wives are keeping their "oaths" by continuing to sacrifice the sons..
Â 
Â 


I'm leaning towards something to do with Neil Marshall. I wonder why the article said they hadn't done slo-mo before when they clearly have. Most recently we got slo-mo when Tyrion was picking up Joff's cup and Cersei saw him in "the Lion and the Rose".


Â 
i dont think it was slow-mo...tyrion was actually moving slow because of shock, or even if it was, it was just a few secs slow-mo
Â 
Â

Â 
that might work, i still wish they focus on LF during the fall just to show how little it affects him and how he stares at sansa while saying "only cat!"Â
5353	Konradsmith	2014-05-02	It was slowed down footage, though obviously not person-running-in-an-action-movie slow.
5354	Carne	2014-05-02	I'm leaning toward's Only Cat scene being the one in slow motion. I find it hard to imagine we'll see Ygritte getting mowed down by arrows ala Boromir. Would be too comical/overly dramatic in my opinion.
5355	Waxfoot	2014-05-02	Ah, yes.
I had heard Gregor would be cutting people up, but when I saw these pictures I was sure it was Oberyn. Upon closer inspection, I was wrong.http://scifimonkeys....got-setpic8.jpghttp://scifimonkeys....got-setpic9.jpg
Also, the slo-mo death has got to be Ygritte

In the books doesn't the Mountain cut in half a stable boy (who got too close to the fight)? Could it be a version of that element?
5356	DaveyJoe	2014-05-02	I'm just going by director technique and Marshall used slow motion several times in Blackwater, Tywin's charge, the flaming man running towards the Hound, and I think the wildfire explosion might have been slowed down a bit.Â  Marshall also uses it in his films, most notably Centurion.
5357	The Onion Sleight	2014-05-02	Â 
how about s4e6? a lot of the focus is gona be on tyrion's trial most likely, but maybe they could start off the ep with dragonstone and showing mel nude, bath, then getting dressed and going to her box of goodies and hiding them up her sleeves...then goes to see stannis/davos who are on their way to bravos or the wall...after that moves to tyrions trial maybe?Â 
Â 
better to get them out of the way early so focus can stay on Tyrions trial, LF, Arya through e6,7,8...


Â 
It could be 4x06, yes. I don't know why we would need such a scene... (okay, it's Carice taking a bath, I understand it wellÂ  )... okay, and later on the Wall she'll need the powders anyway, so, why not...
Â 
Why "get them out of the way early"?! No! :-(
The episode's description is: "(1) Stannis and Davos set sail with a new strategy. (2) Dany meets with supplicants. (3) Tyrion faces down his father in the throne room."Â Â  Ramsay/Theon/Yara are also more than likely for this episode, but why focus on LF or Arya?! They already appear in 5 and probably 8 (for Arya very probably), and 7 is even named after LF. They will be the focus often enough. Why don't let other people be the focus of 6? :-)

5359	Ankou	2014-05-02	How about Brienne experiencing what Pod is really capable of......... All hail Tripod, the stallion that mounts the world! "He'll only slow me down." Oh yes, he will!


Word is Pod is the only man who could satisfy a woman of Brienne's size.Â
5360	Seneti	2014-05-02	I'm pretty sure they've changed Oberyn's death to being sliced in half. That's likely the shot we saw of Gregor in the trailer. And remember what Oberyn said to Tyrion in the premier?"The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane, the Mountain, raped Elia and split her in half with his greatsword."


Â 
I agree. Given that they changed what happened to Elia, they'll most likely change what happened to Oberyn as well. We'll have to see...
5361	Father of Dragons	2014-05-02	...I really hope it wont be an awkward Stannis / Mel farewell scene before the journey to Braavos...I imagine Stannis will take everyone with him to Braavos on the way to the Wall, but only he and Davos will treat with the Iron Bank.
I'm leaning toward's Only Cat scene being the one in slow motion. I find it hard to imagine we'll see Ygritte getting mowed down by arrows ala Boromir. Would be too comical/overly dramatic in my opinion.And a close-up of Lysa's face slowly zooming out as she falls isn't? Maybe not in Boromir fashion, but I'm sure it'll be Ygritte. Only Neil Marshall has used slow motion (apart from the now-absent Alan Taylor)
It was slowed down footage, though obviously not person-running-in-an-action-movie slow.No, I'm pretty sure that wasn't slowed down. It would've been too out-of-place considering everything else was at normal speed. Upon rewatching, Tyrion leans down to grab the cup, and slowly rises back up while examining it. It's not slow motion.
Isn't it obviously Ramsay who will be legitimized this episode?Remember the words of Roose:"You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family - for our family - and I'll reconsider your position."
When Ramsay takes Moat Cailin in presumably episode 10, he'll be legitimised.

Hopefully they take her with them... If not, I hope they bring her at least something from there (she was eventually the one who gave Davos the idea with Braavos); remember when Shireen told her father that Davos promised her (before the Battle of the Blackwater) he'd bring her back a present from the capitol? Well, the last time he couldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t, maybe this time? :3

I watch the show on my laptop and every time we're in Dragonstone, I have to change the brightness/contrast. Dragonstone's bad lighting makes my laptop's battery to run down extreme fast (I know, it's gloomy place with a dark reputation, and I love this dusky Dragonstone atmosphere, but...c'mon XD)
I hope it, too and you're right

What do you mean "for the benefit of the Unsullied" ? Do Pycelle and Qyburn relate to the Unsullied some how?
 I'm new to the forums, but I've read all the books once and I watch the series a lot, and I'm interested in what this means.

5370	iheartseverus	2014-05-02	^^ Yes, what he said.Â  I'm laughing (not at you, uhyana!) because here we've called non-book-readers 'Unsullied' for so long, that now I have to stop and think while I'm reading reviews or whatever and Unsullied are mentioned--I'm like, wait, are we talking about Unsullied viewers or the GoT Unsullied army?
Â 
Welcome, uhyana!Â  
Â 
And to explain our use of 'Unsullied' a bit more:Â  There is a small group of very dedicated show-watchers who do not allow themselves to view previews, interviews, articles or anything outside of the GoT episode itself.Â  Then, they discuss and speculate and try to figure out what it all means, just from the actual episode, nothing else.Â  They used to post at a site called TWoP, but that site will close down on May 31, so they've now moved to a site called PTV (previously.tv) to continue their Unsullied discussions.Â  We book readers enjoy reading their discussions because it gives us a good insight to how the show itself it doing in getting across some of the main plot points of the books.Â  If you want to see their discussions, go here:
Â 
http://forums.previo...ame-of-thrones/
Â 
But keep in mind, as a book reader, you cannot post in their Unsullied Habitat--at all !!Â  Its read-only for us book readers.Â  Also, look for a thread in the General section here at Westeros where we discuss what's going on with the Unsullied.Â  http://asoiaf.wester...-thread-part-8/

Does anybody think it's possible Coldhands shows up at Craster's? We never got to meet him with Sam, so maybe Jon will meet him during the battle with the mutineers. In the book, Coldhands went off for a bit to kill the mutineers who were still at Craster's, so I think it would be a logical time to introduce him. Especially if this will be one of the last episodes with Bran before next season.

Two of Cersei's most heinous actions, the murder of Robert's Children and the attempted murder of Tyrion were given to Joffrey on the show. Since this season he's no longer a threat, I wonder if it will be attributed to Littlefinger to build him as the new big bad?

5381	Metopheles	2014-05-02	about the dagger.
I mean this is very very far fetched, but considering they love to change stuff with the same endgame, what if Podrick tells Stoneheart that the dagger goes to Joffrey, and therefore settles the dispute with Tyrion and Cattie, thus releasing Brienne from the rope, making him the saviour of them.

how would pod know? he wasnt in Tyrion's service then...
5383	Metopheles	2014-05-02	Â

Pod in the show is different. And he was with Tyrion all the time and knows all about what Tyrion thought of and plotted. So he might have been able to make that connection.
Pod got into Tyrions service soon after the Vale story, and I think they surely talked about it.

That was a helluva moment for them to cut from the show.Â Â I don't think that LF knows that Joffrey was responsible for the dagger.Â  I think he saw an opportunity to ingratiate himself to Catelyn.Â  Keep in mind, LF knows about Lysa's letter to Catelyn, and that Cat will already suspect that the Lannisters murdered Jon Arryn, so he's using that as a moment to have Cat trust him and mistrust the Lannisters.Â

If it's another off screen moment that we haven't seen, where Tyrion has told Pod his suspicions, I'll be angry.Â  Having said that, I can't see that happening at all in the show, because Joffrey never says that he's handled Valyrian steel before as Tywin presents him with Widow's Wail.
5385	Bungholes First	2014-05-02	It's a funny thing, because even though Joffrey came as close as confessing as he could, there are some mysteries that were "solved" that ended up having different outcomes or were never definitively proven.
Until aSoS, everyone concluded the Lannisters killed Jon Arryn as a coverup and Tyrion figured out that Pycelle supplied the poison. Then it turned out untrue.
Likewise up until last week, people were still arguing whether Littlefinger was telling the truth and weren't certain that he or the Tyrells were involved.
Could the attempt on Bran's life have anoter surprise in store?
5386	Uldra I	2014-05-02	In brief, Petyr grew up in the Tully household with Catelyn and Lysa.Â  Lysa has pretty much always been in love with Petyr but Petyr has pretty much always been in love with Catelyn, and only Catelyn.Â  And yes, Lysa will complain about all she's done for him, and probably say something like 'haven't you ever loved anyone?'Â  And there we have, 'yes, only Cat.'Â  *shove*
Thanks! And thanks to others who've answered.  Now things make sense in the thread. :-). What a great bunch of people.

Much of my enjoyment of the show derives from watching the Unsullied lose their shit. It's even more delicious, though, when the show spoils things and the book readers lose their shit. (Exhibit A: White Walkers sequence at the end of 4x04.) I can't wait until the show hits unpublished book territory, and we're all Unsullied for all intents and purposes and freaking out with the rest of them.
Â 
Â 
Â 
im gona have to reread the books...the show really convinced me joffery killed roberts basterds, it tied in too perfectly i suppose with the rest of the scenes...but i thought show did indicate strongly that cerseiÂ was responsible for tyrion attack during blackwater?
Â 
The show reveals for both the bastards and the attempt on Joffrey's life played out almost exactly the same: Tyrion initially believed Cersei was responsible and angled for some sort of confession from Cersei, Tyrion seemed to come to the conclusion from Cersei's reaction to his accusation that Joffrey and not Cersei was responsible, Cersei didn't deny it (and in the case of the bastards she says that Joffrey did what needed to be done), and Tyrion concluded that he was correct. Both times it seemed implied that Joffrey was responsible and that Cersei was not, although I suppose it's sufficiently ambiguous that Cersei is stringing Tyrion along and letting him believe whatever he wants. For show purposes, though, I think the more likely explanation is that the show has resolved those questions so that the viewers can move on, even if the answers the show has given are different from the books (where Cersei was responsible for the bastards and we still don't know who was responsible for the murder attempt at Blackwater).
Â 
I suspected in the books that it was Littlefinger who was behind the attempt on Tyrion's life at Blackwater: Cersei never alludes to it in her POVs, for all that she frets about Tyrion, and there is that Vale connection (Ser Mandon Moore is from the Vale and was brought to KL by Jon Arryn).
Â 
Â 
Â 
Did the actor thatÂ  plays Sam say no Cold Hands in the show or just that there would be no Cold Hands in his story line?
Â 
There's this quote from Bran's actor in advance of Season 4:
Â 
"I was really disappointed because he was the cool conspiracy one in this storyline," he says. "It would have been so much fun to have Coldhands. I'm sure there will probably be a bigger, wider reasons, because it's such a crucial, important character. To suddenly not include him seems a bit [strange]," Hempstead-Wright continues. "I think anything important won't be left out without good reason. So for instance Coldhands, I suspect -- or hope, rather -- that he's been left out because he's going to come into play in a more important way later. But certainly all the important bits will definitely be there, and I look forward to seeing them."
Â 
Kind of cagey, but it sounds like Bran's actor is hopeful at the least that Coldhands will be introduced later on and is being "saved." The change from "suspecting" to "hoping" could mean that Isaac Hempstead-Wright knows that Coldhands will come into play and changed it to "hope" to avoid giving anything away, or changed it from "suspecting" to "hoping" because he realized that it sounded like he was spoiling the audience when in fact he was just expressing his personal hopes. It could be read either way, unfortunately.
Â 
The infamous John Bradley quote was from a WSJ Live interview where he was asked if there was something Sam-related from the books that he missed because it was cut from the show:
Â 
"Uh...I would have liked Coldhands, if at all possible. I think a lot of people thought that when Sam kills the White Walker, people thought that was going to be Coldhands, but Coldhands doesn't really play a part in this show. And there are some things that people will be expecting that will be in this series, in this season, season 4, that may not happen, or if they do happen, won't happen until future series [seasons]. The books and the show are becoming so separate that you can't really second-guess anything, really."
Â 
So it could go either way. I didn't personally see the quote as ruling out Coldhands forever, but it does seem to rule out Coldhands for season 4.

5390	Konradsmith	2014-05-03	I don't know how accurate IMDB's current info for each episode is (I know for a fact that it was wrong earlier in the year, but some of the info's been pretty accurate of late) but at the moment it says Stan, Mel and Davey will appear in "First of His Name". I don't know if that was their agencies who put that info up or it was fan edits, but that's what it says now. I won't get my hopes up though.
5391	Colonel Green	2014-05-03	Could the attempt on Bran's life have anoter surprise in store?


GRRM said way back in 2000 that ASOS would provide the answer to who sent the assassin, so unless he was lying, that was the end of the matter.
5392	hedgeknight001	2014-05-03	Â 
You seriously don't understand why viewers might not remember the corpse from one scene 34 episodes ago? Â Some viewers think Emilia Clarke plays a character named Khaleesi.


Funny -- my wife the unsullied thinks her name is Khaleesi. And, Melisandre is "the redhead." And confuses Roose with Stannis. And has to be reminded that Theon is a Greyjoy.
Â 
She says the same is true at her work, where most are unsullied -- they will talk about the show on Monday and at some point during the day I will get a call from her asking to confirm some relationship, name, or historical point from the show.
Â 
There just isn't any way for unsullied to keep up with the dizzying number names and places thrown at them over the course of 4 years.
5393	gogorath	2014-05-03	I really don't want to be a smart arse about this but its pretty clear that its a statement of being the heir to a family name , who really cares if a person is the first person to have a certain name Â .I'm sure there have not only been other Daenerys but some of them would of been Queens as well. There may have even been Â another king Tommen Lannister that dates back to before Aegon conquered Westeros. There are very few original names . I accept your opinion that the title is about Tommen being named king.

You're wrong. First of his name isn't a game of thrones thing; it literally just refers to the fact that the King or Queen being referred to is the frist King or Queen of that nation to be called that name. European monarchs often changed their name upon being crowned, but all first of his names is that he is King Tommen I.  Areys II would have been crowned Aerys, second of his name.
5394	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-03	I don't know how accurate IMDB's current info for each episode is (I know for a fact that it was wrong earlier in the year, but some of the info's been pretty accurate of late) but at the moment it says Stan, Mel and Davey will appear in "First of His Name". I don't know if that was their agencies who put that info up or it was fan edits, but that's what it says now. I won't get my hopes up though.


The rest of them sure make sense (S04E09 for example), but we haven't seen team Dragonstone in the preview, the synopsis, the pictures or the previous episode recap. Still we had no pictures, no synopsis mention or no recap and preview appearance of Oberyn for episode 3 but there he was.
5395	Konradsmith	2014-05-03	^Yeah the only name on the imdb listing other than Team Dragonstone that didn't make immediate sense toÂ meÂ (given what we'veÂ learned through the recap and promo) was Josef Altin appearing as Pyp. Since he didn't volunteer for the ranging, I did not expect to see him this episode either, though maybe he'll show up to see them off or something and feel guilty for not tagging along.
Â 
If Stan and co. do appear, then the set-up in the scene would have to be self-contained. I didn't expect them really because the recap didn't show Davey and Shireen talking about the IBOB (which I would've thought it would have to have). But if the scene is really self-explanatory, then maybe they wouldn't think they'd need to show it in the recap. Like if Stan outright says, "Did you send a letter to the Iron Bank without my leave?" And Dave says, "Yeah....." and Stan says, "Awesome, we'll sail there next episode." Other than that, unless everything is laid on the table for the viewer, I can't see them including Team Dragonstone withoutÂ any hints in the recap.

5396	ambi76	2014-05-03	Could the attempt on Bran's life have anoter surprise in store?


Â 
GRRM said way back in 2000 that ASOS would provide the answer to who sent the assassin, so unless he was lying, that was the end of the matter.

Â 
Cersei and Jaime also figure out it was Joff with the dagger in AFFC, so maybe the show will do it like that.

5397	igrewupinKL	2014-05-03	The "Only Cat" scene, if it does not happen in the finale, will most likely be in episode 7 or 8. They wouldn't have it as soon as they arrive.
My only concern is that they'll just give away the fact that Lysa poisioned Jon. She says "What wife would do for you what I've done for you?"
I assume she'll be saying this when it's just her and Littlefinger and not in front of anyone, so it'll be like a Varys/Littlefinger conversation, or a Margaery/Olenna one like last episode.
As Colonel Green said, Robin will appear on episode 7, and it seems wrong to have scenes with him without his mother in at least one.
This makes me sound skeptical, but no matter what happens, I'm really looking forward to the Eyrie scenes


Â 
If sweetrobin is in episode 7 then most likely its going to be that episode. ep5 will probably be the wedding and lysa will say "What wife would do for you what I've done for you?"Â to littlefinger but we wont know what she means until ep7. robin is needed for ep7 because of sansa's snowcastle scene..id be disappointed if only cat scene is next episode

Well there still is that Melisandre bath scene we saw in the previews.
So the next question is the Iron Bank going to be in episode 7 or 8?
5399	Konradsmith	2014-05-03	The IBOB is either in episode 6 or 7 because Mark GatissÂ  (our Tycho) said he only has one scene and we saw him in one of the featurettes with Alik Sakharov who directs those two episodes. Also, I doubt we'll get Mel naked next episode because the HBO schedule doesn't list any nudity in episode five. Only graphic violence...
5400	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-03	Interested to see what Brienne will do this season. Septon Meribald, Randyll Tarly and Hyle Hunt weren't cast. It's too early for anything relating to the Hound going around terrorizing Saltpans and the Gravedigger cameo. That leaves... finding a lead on Sansa and pursuing it (as it states in the synopsis), encountering Rorge and Biter, and then Lady Stoneheart. There is a reported scene that was filmed of Gwendoline and Daniel skinning rabbits outside a cottage (oh, how D&D love to skin rabbits). I'm guessing it will be that in episode five. I think they're gonna rely on the odd pairing of Brienne and Podrick to carry the storyline. Maybe next season, on her way to Jaime, they can have the Meribald/Gravedigger stuff (I hope).

Didn't notice the Sakharov thing. I have hunch, that it's going to be episode 7. I don't see how Carice van Houten's quote about Stannis having a light season makes sense. If Stannis appears in episodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 that's quite a lot compared to last season.
5402	Konradsmith	2014-05-03	^Well IMDB, if it is to be trusted, says that they'll also be in ep. 7. I don't know. Given that he's the first name mentioned in 406's summary, he might be prominent enough to not need to appear until his big hero moment in 409.
Â 
Ignorant Bog Woman, some of Meribald's monologue could potentially be given to Thoros another war-weary religious chap. But yeah, Brienne's AFFC journey will likely be very much abridged, for better or for worse.

Does anybody think it's possible Coldhands shows up at Craster's? We never got to meet him with Sam, so maybe Jon will meet him during the battle with the mutineers. In the book, Coldhands went off for a bit to kill the mutineers who were still at Craster's, so I think it would be a logical time to introduce him. Especially if this will be one of the last episodes with Bran before next season.



	Spoiler Why would this be the last scene with bran before next season .. isn't the finale kind of about bran?

5404	Mordos_Kull	2014-05-03	Well apparently Stannis is less episodes this season (didn't Stephen Dilanne confirm that?)
Â 
So I figure he's in 2,3,6,9,10. We need a 3 episode gap to make the arrival at the wall more a surprise for the unsullied (although they all pretty much are aware he's going north to fight, they are just fed up with the fact he hasn't already)
5405	Hath4	2014-05-03	I think team dragnostone will be in epsiode 6 in whcih they go to bravos, then 9 and 10. As for ramsay and reek they will probaly be in 6,7,8 and 10. yara attacks the dreadfort in epsiode 6 and reek at moat cailin is most likly epsiode 8 plus you have ramsay and rooses forces meeting which I assume will be in epsiode 10. It has been weird that they have not been appearing much so far this year. but this is probably a good preview of how they will handle season 5. less storylines per epsiode which will leave some out for many weeks, it is the only way to construct a good season 5.

A trip from Dragonstone to Braavos in one episode doesn't sound right. Who knows maybe they leave Dragonstone in episode 5 and the "set sail" part of the episode 6 synopsis means, that they leave Braavos.

Â 
Or they start already near Braavos. It's already implied that they'll be going that way what with Davos and Shireen contacting them.
5408	kjm16216	2014-05-03	I doubt Stannis personally visits Braavos. If Davos was planning a personal visit, why write a letter?
Braavos will appear in the finale, or close to it, and they will show Arya arriving.

There are shots in trailers of Stannis and Davos sitting down with Tycho and the Iron Bank in Braavos. Also shots of his ship passing by the Titan.
Â 
Arya most likely gets on the boat to leave for Braavos in the finale.

I'd really like that. Build up on the situation, perhaps see some hanged Freys, even hear some rumours about the brotherhood's new leader - the LSH reveal won't feel like a bolt out of the blue.

That would be the most evident choice to do, yeah.
Â 
I dont see what else can she and Pod do. See the devastation of war, but we already have our Dog and Wolf duo for that. An inevitable confrontation with Rorge and Biter (we know Rorge's actor is back this season and we know Brienne bite an ear of somewhere down the line) but apart from that and really possibly the final meeting with LS (which I'm in favor of), I dont see what else they can do on the road.

Or... sudden long shot but I strongly think it will never happen ; she is the one to injure the Hound !

About that interview with John Bradley.. He was saying that coldhands was cut from HIS storyline. The whole " coldhands does not really play a part on this show" is what he knew so far, and I believe if he indeed knew about removing the character from all seasons, he would not be allowed to announce something like that.
Â 
Also this will definatelly not be the last episode that includes Bran. There has been a child cast for the role of a children of the forest (possibly Leaf), so Bran's story has still much to show. Not to mention that the last episode is called "Children"Â

They cast Bloodraven who we'll either see in another Bran vision or in the finale where we'll see him in person once they get to the cave and are saved by the Children of the Forest (one of whom, your Leaf substitute, has also been cast).
Â 
The fact that Bran is communicating with BR directly through the weirwoods and that the ravens showing up seem to signify BR's presence as opposed to anyone else is a pretty good indicator that they aren't including Coldhands as they don't need a third party guide to get to BR, he's cutting out the middleman.Â  On the show, you've also got the crew armed to the teeth with Dragonglass (given to them by Sam in the S3 finale) which will undoubtedly be used for them to defend themselves against the WW's.Â  Another reason you don't need Coldhands as they have a means to defend themselves effectively.
5420	franko99	2014-05-03	Speaking of LS, this may be a stupid question, but since the show has done some "prologues" (I mean one scene before the opening song of the first episode) for seasons 1, 3 and 4, do you think they will do an "epilogue" for the final scene, like waiting for the credits to be over and then show the reveal, some movies directors like to do that Â

In the season 4 foreshadowing (I believe), Gwendoline mentions that she bites off a man's ear and spits it at him, so it may be that we get her epic fight with "the Hound" impersonator, where she loses half her face. That's total speculation though. The characters have already been switched around a lot, so who knows. I see them truncating that story big time. 
Gravedigger storyline will hopefully be next season. I think Arya leaves the Hound too late this season for Brienne to realistically run in to him at the Quiet Isle (or substitute) already healed.

Yet again, we don't know for sure if CH is going to be cut or not, because he may play an important role in the next two books. Maybe he's the same actor with the one that will be playing BR, and that's why we didn't see an actor cast as CH.

About the company armed with Dragonglass... Last episode showd how easily they managed to get captured by the Night's watch mutineers. Even if they did not strip them from all weapons, they would not stand a chance against a WW.

They could show LSH for first time when Brienne gets captured by the BWB. and then explain her backstory or show it with some short or flashback or something. But I don't think we'll see LSH, because Brienne has many things to do before that as you said.

5428	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-03	Well, now you mention Melisandre... What will she do the rest of the season? We know shes certainly together with Stannis' host at Castle Black in 4.09 and Im sure we will see her burning Orells eagle (Carice already said something about time on a horseback this season and a stunt woman / double) and as from 4.10 then, she stays with Jon & Co. at Castle Black.
Â But I heard something about her having a bath scene and theres this picture: http://37.media.tumb...bszkbo2_250.gif
Â Carice also said well see more of Mels things: http://www.thegate.c...ame-of-thrones/
Â In the fourth season you do see a little more of Melisandres room and the stuff she usesshe has a little cabinet of powders. This one puts people to sleep, that one makes men wildly lustful, this one will kill you instantly...
Â SoMels room, her magic powders, a bath When should this happen?! Certainly not at Castle Black and absolutely not on that ship, so it must be her room in Dragonstone. Will we see something like In the meantime, in Dragonstone when Stannis and Davos are in Braavos or what? I really hope it wont be an awkward Stannis / Mel farewell scene before the journey to Braavos, with Stannis gatecrash her taking a bath and seeing her naked and *remembering beach scene*Â  Â  urg, No!But she wouldnt show him her powders, so more likely a Mel-alone or Mel/Selyse scene? In an episode before 4.09? 4.05 / 4.06 / 4.07 / 4.08?

Interesting. Do we think she might have used the lust dust on Stannis in their sex scene? Would explain some otherwise OOC stuff
5429	trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell	2014-05-03	just saw the promo again...2 scenes caught my attention, Jojen telling Bran "you mustn't let anything stop you" and Hodor holding his knees and rocking back and forth...im excited about what they gonna show but im really hoping for Bran to warg in to Hodor and Hulk smash through everything and escape with summer, freeing Ghost...right when they are escaping and during the confusion, Jon and NW show up and attack the mutineers
Â 
aftermath of the fight, Locke makes up some shit and convinces Jon that Bran's been killed. then either Locke decides its not worth chasing Bran since he's continuing further north rather than south, he'll decide Bran's not a threat.
Â 
no idea if they going to reunite Ghost and Jon, I dont think they should this early but wouldn't have a big problem if they did. and i hope they dont show Bran leaving Jojen and Meera behind as part of "you mustn't let anything stop you". Â

About the company armed with Dragonglass... Last episode showd how easily they managed to get captured by the Night's watch mutineers. Even if they did not strip them from all weapons, they would not stand a chance against a WW.


Hey, anything's possible I guess but every single piece of evidence points to CH being cut.
Â 
FYI, this is the old dude that's been cast as Bloodraven so if you're somehow suggesting he's playing Coldhands as well/instead, then I suggest rethinking that notion:
http://blog.screenwe...10/103082.1.jpg
Â 
Also, the Dragonglass is really only effective against WW's and the fact that they made a point of having Sam arm them all with Dragonglass means that it will be used against the WW's at some point, it's the law of television drama.
5437	ipsuel	2014-05-03	Speaking of LS, this may be a stupid question, but since the show has done some "prologues" (I mean one scene before the opening song of the first episode) for seasons 1, 3 and 4, do you think they will do an "epilogue" for the final scene, like waiting for the credits to be over and then show the reveal, some movies directors like to do that 
Â 
I know, chances are it won't happen, but it could be fun if they try that LOLÂ

5441	tyrell19	2014-05-03	I doubt the their role in the death is revealed. Im guessing the mystery is brought up again and she tells sansa her husband killed her husband and I assume sansa can smell the bull shit which would match what Turner says about the character becoming more a player this season.
Â 
Also don't mean to sound pervy but what Melisandre bath scene in a preview? I know she mentioned it in an interview but didn't realise we'd seen a glimpse from it

5443	Lee-Sensei	2014-05-03	She's one of the Lords Declarant that comes calling after LF offs Lysa, because they're concerned about LF being Protector of the Vale until Robin comes of age.Â  I also recall that LF is able to win her over gradually by the promise of "Alayne Stone" marrying Harry the Heir.

Why can't the actor play both CH and BR? The two characters don't even meet in the books (so far at least)
Â 
Also again.. It would be completelly ridiculous if bran's company continues alone further north and face & kill WWs when they got captured by some random deserters without even a fight.Â

Â 
Why would the show ever cast an actor to play two different roles concurrently? What purpose would that serve? Also, the guy's like 70 years old, how does it make sense for him to play Coldhands?
Â 
I've given you multiple reasons why they will able to travel North themselves. First, Bran's being guided by BR directly through the weirwoods so they don't need a guide. Secondly, they don't appear to meet up with the WW's until the finale when they're near the cave. They have the Dragonglass to protect themselves and they will likely be rescued by the COTF at the last minute, as it is in the books.
Â 
How is Bran and co being able to defend themselves for a little while against WW's any more ridiculous than cowardly, fat Sam Tarly taking one out? Dragonglass is their kryptonite, Bran is going to be able to warg into Hodor effectively which he'll learn this episode and they'll have Summer with them, unlike when they got captured at Craster's.
Â 
I feel like I'm talking to someone who just really, really wants Coldhands to be present and is working every argument backwards from there instead of looking at what the evidence is right in front of all of our noses and drawing conclusions from that.

5448	Tyrion1991	2014-05-03	Â 
Â 
I think Dany making it clear what she still needs to do before she can leave for Westeros is incredibly important. There should be some definitive milestone put out there (double the size of her army, get a certain number of allies, build x number of ships, have the dragons grow to a certain size etc) that tells the audience that she can't go yet. You can't just have her say "You know what? I feel obligated to stay and rule here indefinitely because it's my responsibility" because that's the kind of thing that pissed off everyone reading the book.


Â 
This, Absolutely. This is an exercise in damage limitation, a lot of non book readers will call filler unless they put that milestone out there and put Danys position in perspective. It doesn't help that she has the only army we regularly see which gives a false impression. For example we saw a few hundred extras for Blackwater yet saw many times that number of Unsullied extras.

I'm just saying that it is still possible. In the end none really knows if CH will play an important role in the next two books. We are all making assumptions here...

Â 
"In the end", D&D know whether CH will play an important role or not because George has told them. So they can make decisions based on that knowledge.
Â 
Your theory is dependent on (if I'm reading you correctly) the notion that they cast a 70 year old actor to play Bloodraven (which makes sense) but for some unknown reason, they'd also like him to play a completely different character at the same time even though he doesn't physically match that character in any way.
5455	Metopheles	2014-05-03	Who cares about Coldhands? He is only good on the paper. It would be nearly impossible to present him and satisfy us. And he is a super unimportant character. Bran's arc has ended. He will not leave that cave.Â 
I don't see the point of Coldhands.
And most importantly: If they would show him, the mystery around him would be gone. We would know what he is. And what makes him a great character is, that we do not know what he is.

I, for one, don't care if a character is in or out, I care about bringing the story back to book canon.
Cold CH and BR be combined? I don't think it kills the story for the guy riding the horse to dismount and get into the tree throne or whatever it is.

Â 
I've found that they are edited very meticulously to impart the information that they want to relay to the audience about the upcoming episode. Sometimes they will even move certain pieces of dialogue over scenes that aren't shown that way originally in order to maintain this effect. They will also cut the scene down to the very essence of the information that's important. If a line is there, it is included for a reason.
Â 
I just see no other reason to go back to that scene with Ned and Cat where they are talking specifically about Lysa sending them the letter about Jon Arryn and pinning it on the Lannisters and even including Luwin telling Ned that this means he should go to King's Landing to protect Robert, effectively setting everything in motion for LF.
Â 
There are plenty of scenes to reference Lysa or even Jon Arryn that don't relay this very specific information to the audience. This is D&D saying "Remember that Lysa is the one who got the whole Stark/Lannister conflict started. We're going to revist that again this episode."

I think, that IMDB is more reliable on who will appear, than who won't. For example Ciaran Hinds (Mance Rayder) doesn't appear on their S4E9 cast list, and we know that that's not true.
5484	Metopheles	2014-05-03	I think the imdb stuff is mostly guessing. I looked it up weeks before the premiere and now, but it doesn't say that much. It lists a series of actors that are on the show, but doesn't say much. Wouldn't bet on it.
But I agree with a previous post that it is unlikely they do all the major twists and deaths in the last episode. It would be too much to digest(ha..Tywin).

5485	Metopheles	2014-05-03	Oh and remember, often actors are credited but do not appear and vice versa. On the got wiki page they mention it all the time in their articles about actors.

Every episode? I heard that there were multiple climactic points across the season, but every episode? I guess that kinda makes sense: E1: Arya kills Polliver, E2: Joffrey's death, E3: Dany's speech and Daario killing the champion, E4: White Walker reveal, E5: Battle at Craster's Keep, E6: Tyrion's trial, E7: "Only Cat", E8: Oberyn and Gregor duel, E9: Battle of Castle Black, E10: multiple, but the biggest being Tywin's death.

Not really. They have been showing Winterfell burning for one and a half season now, and we haven't visited it once. They also showed Pyke all across season 2. I just wished they would have shown Yunkai in S4E1 and E2 since Meereen made it's first appearance in E3, and god knows that will be seeing enough of Meereen in the future.

Â 
I think a few of the actors have said something to the effect that as opposed to there being one "big" climax episode like 3x09 or 2x09, there's a series of climaxes spread out throughout Season 4 (...insert your own joke here). I guess that sort of fits with what we've seen to date--with one of the biggest moments (Joffrey dies) in 4x02--and what seems to be hinted for 4x05 (big battle at Craster's). On the other hand, the cast and crew have also been playing up 4x10 as the Biggest Episode Ever, and from what we know of ASOS and from what's been said about 4x10, it will definitely pack the biggest wallop.
Â 
For Dany, could it be that in 4x05 she makes the decision to stay and rule in Meereen? That would effectively take her to the end of her ASOS story, although the show still has to deal with Jorah's banishment. I wonder just how far Season 4 will go into her ADWD storyline: chaining the dragons, maybe? (There was that shot from the promos of Drogon closing in on a person.)

She talks a bit about what's to come and says there will be a fight in the deepest mud she's ever seen and that one of the stars is so adept with sword fighting that they didn't need a double. I presume she meant Kit.

Who could be sword fighting that hasn't already?
LF? Sansa? Arya? Or...
Hodor?
5491	Metopheles	2014-05-03	I doubt there will ever be an episode's climax be better than the "Blood of my Blood" scene, the birth of the dragons. or the Mhysa scene.
Tywins death..
I mean, not to be arrogant or full of myself, but if I had to chose what to make as finale for s4, I would have made Tyrion kill tywin way earlier and then sorta change the start of the Essos storyline and make him meet Aegon or learn about him in the last scene of the season. That would have been as amazing as it could be.

Are you implying the Mhysa scene was good as a season ender? Because no, lol. Just no. It does not compare to the season 1 and 2 end scenes.
5493	sati	2014-05-03	I think if done right, LS reveal may top season 1 final scene
5494	Dreams and Prophecies	2014-05-03	I think if done right, LS reveal may top season 1 final scene

especially if it succeeded "only cat."

season 2 was horrible. The plundering scene and then the weird nonsensical other scene. That was proper bullshit.
5496	tyrell19	2014-05-03	As much as I would love them to have LS follow only Cat is completely understandable that they may have to change the structure of the narrative. We shouldn't judge each scene on whether they come next to each although it would be nice if they did.
5497	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-03	season 2 was horrible. The plundering scene and then the weird nonsensical other scene. That was proper bullshit.


It still works better to cap the season off as it gets people excited for next year. The Mhysa scene was just disappointing after the big cliffhangers at the end of seasons one and two.
5498	Zombies That Were Promised	2014-05-03	I doubt there will ever be an episode's climax be better than the "Blood of my Blood" scene, the birth of the dragons. or the Mhysa scene.

Â 
Â 
If the Jon Arryn reveal for ep 5. and Only Cat for ep.7 is true, I will start to question the padding that is delaying things like the Battle for the Wall so that it's Episode 9. Â After Season 3, we had 1/3 of ASOS left. We could have finished ASOS completely by Season 4 Episode 5 and be in strictly AFFC/ADWD to close out Season 4. Â It was my understanding from interviews that they did not do this, so that the ASOS endings could end out a season and they would strictly adhere to the perfect narrative structure from the book.
Â 
Â 
-also, I loved Mhysa too. Â It was amazing to see Emilia Clarke's smile and not just because I'm a male.

5499	Konradsmith	2014-05-03	It was a pretty epic final shot but a lot of people found it underwhelming. The Dragons and Three Blasts were cliffhangers whereas that was just an up-note to remind folks that there was some good left in the world after the RW.

5500	Metopheles	2014-05-03	I am absolutely against Stannis, but I would like to have as ending this year, him leading the wildlings through the Wall as season closer. It would be absolutely amazing seeing him on a balcony with Lightbringer and Jon and Melisandre, a grim Tormund, and let the wildlings into shelter from the Others.
5501	Arkash	2014-05-03	so Myrcella reference = Queenmaker plot this episode guaranteedÂ Â  
Â 
Â 

Â 
Yep, that's immediatly what I thought when I knew Oberyn and Cersei will have their scene together this episode. Cersei could confront Oberyn about Myrecella's safety and ask for news and Oberyn could observe that by Dornish laws, today should be the coronment of Myrcella and not Tommen. Could be a great dialogue !

5503	Metopheles	2014-05-03	some story lines will reach into AFFC and ADwD and other will not


And at the end of the day, all the characters have to wait for Jon and Dany to finish their arcs and finally catching up with the others.
sad but true
5504	Seneti	2014-05-03	Speaking of LS, this may be a stupid question, but since the show has done some "prologues" (I mean one scene before the opening song of the first episode) for seasons 1, 3 and 4, do you think they will do an "epilogue" for the final scene, like waiting for the credits to be over and then show the reveal, some movies directors like to do that 
Â 
I know, chances are it won't happen, but it could be fun if they try that LOLÂ 


Â 
Wow... hadn't considered that yet (it's called a stinger in the movie/TV industry). Part of me loves the idea, but given how many viewers turn off their TV or switch channels as soon as the credits roll, I think it's safe to assume they are not going to do that.
Â 
Â 


So far this season the very last thing showed in "previously on" has led into the very first scene of the episode. I guess that means we'll open with Tommen?


Â 
Nice observation. 24.5 h left to go, then we'll see 
Â 


Kate Dickie (lysa) is credited to appear in episode 10. Now IÂ know Imdb is not the most trustful source, but since she is credited for ep 5, ep 7 and ep 10, can we confirm that only cat is in ep. 10?
Â 
Interestingly, Sophie Turner is not credited for ep. 7 (mockingbird).Â 


Â 
I certainly hope so. Having "only cat" before ep. 10 would be entirely underwhelming.
5505	ugashep	2014-05-03	I had a random thought today. The showÂ at times has expanded or highlightedÂ a book character and sometimes glorified anÂ extra because the directors really like the actor or actress and want to utilize them more. I think most agree that Burn Gorman has been fantastic as Karl Tanner, a character largely created for the show. My thought was does anybody think there is any chance they may have Karl escape with Locke fromÂ the retribution of Jon and Company at Craster's Keep and join the Bolton gang? Locke and Burn Gorman would make a formidable core for the Bastard's Boys group we have yet to see in earnest on the show. I am not saying I think this will happen but I don't think it would be out of character with the way the show operates. Rast is a dead man in any event I think though.

5506	iheartseverus	2014-05-03	^^Â  Interesting!!Â  I also read an interesting post at TWoP about Gorman's over the top, scenery-chewing evil dude performance.Â  The poster said it was obvious to her that Karl was all 'I'm the murderous muthuh from Gin Alley, nobody lives when I go after them, I drink from skulls, bwhaaa....'Â  but that all that was because he's really a scared, nobody punk, probably just some shoemaker's assistant from Flea Bottom or whatever who got caught stealing from the cash register.Â Â Â  It makes sense to me, and that's how I see it now.Â  So, it would also make a great dynamic for him, the murderous muthuh from Gin Alley (ha!) to team up with Locke, the real murderous muthuh from the Dreadfort.Â  I like it!Â  Such fun to speculate like an Unsullied, after all these years--not knowing what the hell might be coming next!
Â 
And yes, Rast is direwolf tidbits.

5507	King Tommen	2014-05-03	Jon and Karl face off inside Craster's as we've seen from some footage. It's unlikely that Karl ends up getting away alive from that confrontation.
5508	Bran Snow	2014-05-03	^ It will end with Claw in Karl's skull
5509	Dany's Silver	2014-05-03	<snip>And yes, Rast is direwolf tidbits.


Bloody, chewy tidbits. Â  [We need a direwolf emoticon, stat!]
Â 
Rast is for the direwolves; Karl's death belongs to Jon...Â  It is known.
5510	Colonel Green	2014-05-03	^ It will end with Claw in Karl's skull


I'd actually been thinking about that, since presumably the guy who desecrated Lord Mormont's body will be killed with Lord Mormont's sword.

5512	Newstar	2014-05-03	Wasn't there a reference around when Season 4 started airing to an extremely bloody death that the crew had to keep toning down and reshooting because it was "too much" and was too violent and gory as filmed? I was under the impression that it was supposed to air in one of the episodes in the first half of the season.

5514	iheartseverus	2014-05-03	Peeps, I just posted a plea to Ran in the Help section, asking that we be given a 'Season Five - Uncharted Territory' sub-forum, since the show vs the books has (as of last episode) officially moved us into just that--uncharted territory.Â  Anyway, take a look at it, see what you think.Â  If you like it (or don't) perhaps post your comments there so Ran will have a sense of what the members would like to see (or not).Â
5515	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-03	Â 
Â 
Cleganeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hand shot up and grabbed the Dornishman behind the knee. The Red Viper
brought down the greatsword in a wild slash, but he was off-balance, and the edge did no
more than put another dent in the Mountainâ<U+0080><U+0099>s vambrace. Then the sword was forgotten
as Gregorâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hand tightened and twisted, yanking the Dornishman down on top of him.
They wrestled in the dust and blood, the broken spear wobbling back and forth. Tyrion
saw with horror that the Mountain had wrapped one huge arm around the prince,
drawing him tight against his chest, like a lover.
Â 
â<U+0080><U+009C>Elia of Dorne,â<U+0080><U+009D> they all heard Ser Gregor say, when they were close enough to kiss. His
deep voice boomed within the helm. â<U+0080><U+009C>I killed her screaming whelp.â<U+0080><U+009D> He thrust his free
hand into Oberynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s unprotected face, pushing steel fingers into his eyes. â<U+0080><U+009C>Then I raped
her.â<U+0080><U+009D> Clegane slammed his fist into the Dornishmanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mouth, making splinters of his
teeth. â<U+0080><U+009C>Then I smashed her fucking head in. Like this.â<U+0080><U+009D> As he drew back his huge fist, the
blood on his gauntlet seemed to smoke in the cold dawn air. There was a sickening
crunch. Ellaria Sand wailed in terror, and Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s breakfast came boiling back up. He
found himself on his knees retching bacon and sausage and applecakes, and that double
helping of fried eggs cooked up with onions and fiery Dornish peppers.
Â 


My god thats brutal. I think I'm more excited for this duel than any other scene, besides maybe Tyrion killing Twyin.Â
5516	Tyrion Hand of the King	2014-05-03	Â 
Kinda, yeah:Â https://www.youtube....h?v=PW6wfXPeJTw
Â 
It's more that they cut the sound out. I don't know, the more I think about it the more I wish we weren't going to be getting a slow-mo death, but hopefully they pull it off alright.


Ugh that was such a depressing clip to watch.Â
5517	Raksha 2014	2014-05-03	King's Landing wasn't built at that point, though, so there was no centralized position that he had to conquer; where in ASoIaF and in Game of Thrones, conquering KL is the thing to do if you want to conquer Westeros.Â  Mind you, given the size (and irascibility) of Dany's dragons, she's not conquering all of Westeros just yet....Â  Not without help from Dorne.
Â 
Of course there's a double standard regarding female masturbation.Â  I recently heard that Girls (HBO) removed a scene with female masturbation (but had no problem with male masturbation). Â  Fully developed female sexuality doesn't seem to be as important showing as T&A as possible.Â  Otherwise, we might have seen a sexually frustrated Dany find release with the help of one of her handmaidens, but they'll no doubt skip that and head straight to Daario... I bet that when Jorah realizes that this is going his relationship with Dany turns sour and he'll be off to Volantis!


Â 
Â 
Personally, I can survive very comfortably without seeing any masturbation on Game of Thrones or other shows. Â Some things can be left to the imagination. Â I don't watch Game of Thrones for the boobage and sex scenes....

5519	Guard of the Rainking	2014-05-04	I doubt there will ever be an episode's climax be better than the "Blood of my Blood" scene, the birth of the dragons. or the Mhysa scene.
Tywins death..
I mean, not to be arrogant or full of myself, but if I had to chose what to make as finale for s4, I would have made Tyrion kill tywin way earlier and then sorta change the start of the Essos storyline and make him meet Aegon or learn about him in the last scene of the season. That would have been as amazing as it could be.


If you were answering my post, then I didn't Â mean that Tywin's death would be the last scene (just the most dramatic). The best possible ending would be "Only Cat" followed by Stoneheart, but if Lysa dies in episode 7 then I'm happy with just plain Stoneheart in the finale.
Mhysa? IMO they should have done something other than a Dany final scene since they had already done one in S1 and it wasn't a huge game changer. Maybe a montage of Stannis' men preparing to head for the Wall, since that was arguably the biggest thing that happened in E10.
5520	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-04	In the recap, I recall there being a reference to Cersei's arranged marriage to Loras. She's still trying to find a way out of it. I think Tywin will stop her betrothal to Loras, and she'll be ecstatic for a split second, only for him to suggest she marry Oberyn, which leads into her walking with him in the garden to size him up or whatever. Tywin would find it a better match as it strengthens their unstable relationship with Dorne and, in theory, gets Oberyn on his side for the trial.

5521	Konradsmith	2014-05-04	^They also showed Jaime saying to Loras that he could never marry Cersei. I imagine this episode will be where that arrangement is cancelled. Because of that maybe she'll also propose to Oberyn, whether on Tywin's orders or not,

5522	Ignorant Bog Woman	2014-05-04	Edit: Apparently Book!Cersei did propose to Oberyn. When Oberyn visits Tyrion, he says Cersei has been hinting at marriage for Tyrion's head and that Ellaria is excited to 'share a Cersei.'
Â 
I could see her doing it.

LC can make new kingsguard without approval of Hand and/or King (Hand in this case because the King is a puppet)? If so, that sure adds drama to Tywin/Jaime. I want to see them spat over it. Their exchange in the premiere was far too mild.
5525	Konradsmith	2014-05-04	I wonder if we'll see Olenna one last time then, maybe givingÂ Loras permission to discontinue his betrothal before she rides off back to Highgarden. Really her Oathkeeper scene with Marge is good enough as a last scene, but maybe she'll appear again to do this. I just wonder how the show could have Loras join the Kingsgaurd since their canon has established that he's the only Tyrell son. They could retcon Willas or Garlan as cousins, I guess.

5526	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-04	We don't know. But I'm sure Jaime/Loras could get Tommen, newly crowned, to do it. Would be a shame to see Jaime take advantage of his "nephew" like that though. But certainly not impossible
5527	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-04	Tyrells have cousins. And as their aim is to have Marg's kid on the throne, if she has more than 1 boy the younger boy will be Heir to Highgarden
5528	SerArthurHeath	2014-05-04	Also, Jaime would surely empathise with Loras wanting to join the KG behind his parents' back to get out of a marriage that didn't suit his sexual preferences and to be near his sister (though for different reasons)

5530	Konradsmith	2014-05-04	^Well, her joke about always having to walk through the gardens was meta enough for me.
5531	Koi No Yokan	2014-05-04	A little tease from Michelle MacLaren for tonight's episode (from The Hollywood Reporter): Â 
Â 
As for what's to come on Sunday, there isn't much she can say, other than one scene was shot in "the deepest mud" she's ever seen, and that one of her stars was so adept with a blade that he didn't need the stunt double who was on hand during a key sword fighting sequence.
5532	iheartseverus	2014-05-04	^ When I saw that, about the mud, I wondered if it might be raining during the fight at Craster's.Â  I hope not, but I'm guessing a heavy downpour might help them with the CGI, the wolves (hopefully!) attacking and slashing and likely having more on-screen time and action than we've yet seen with the direwolves.Â  A heavy downpour might also make it easier to explain Bran & co's ability to slip away and escape while the fighting is going on.
5533	Lord_Dustin	2014-05-04	The recap for this episode really does give a lot away.
Â 
I'm looking forward to seeing how the show is going to deal with the Loras/Cersei betrothal. Â Hopefully Margaery and Loras can share some screen time too. Â Â
5534	howardh51	2014-05-04	Did we just see Arya killing The Hound?
Needle is Valyrian steel, and deadly sharp at it's point! if we go by book logic, such a stab should definitely penetrate armor. Any one else thinks this is the episode they separate?


Needle is not valyrian steel...
5535	GinesthoiOfIce	2014-05-04	To all those afraid that 'Only Cat' might come earlier than expected, if IMDB is anything to go by, then Kate Dickie/Lysa Arryn is credited for episode 10, 'The Children'. I think It would really be a pity not to have theÂ Tully sisters endingÂ as in the books, which was perfect IMO.Â Lysa as, most Unsullied don't like her, will be also interesting to keep around until the end, to attempt to fill the void left by Joffrey. The Lords DeclarantÂ will, I think, be used to see howÂ Lysa handles them after her marriage to Littlefinger, which most of them are against.
Â 
AnywayÂ this should be a really great episode,Â I really look forward to theÂ Eyrie scenes, Margaery/Tommen/Cersei and Bran as well Â Â

Also waiting for Cersei to kill the High Septon. I hope it happens in this season. Maybe he knows about the sept-sex and confronts her about it? Her motives for doing it in the book wouldn't be very clear on the show right now, unless Lancel comes back next season and does his confession.

Season 2- In foresight not so good, knowing nothing comes of this scene but it was an epic cliffhanger. It showed the White Walkers are a massive threat and keeps the idea lingering.
Â 
Season 3- It was more cheesy than epic, especially after the intense episode 9 and Danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s â<U+0080>big momentâ<U+0080><U+0099> (getting the Unsullied) overshadowing it so it was pretty disappointing. No cliffhanger, just glorifying Dany.

But at least it made sense. The Other scene was nonsense. Why would the wights and the Other just move around and then disappear? That scene made no sense at all. I loved the first scene ever with the prologue, that gave me chills(didn't read the books before) and it was amazing and enough. Really, they showed the Walkers way too much. If, then they should have used the scene from last week as a season finale.
And of course it glorified Dany. That is the whole point. She freed thousands of people. What else do you want? Not everybody craves for some zombie cliffhanger.

I also want Karl to become intimately acquainted with Longclaw, but I'm hoping for some sword thru head action.Â 


Karl's got a date with Karma. Â  As much as I am wary of the plot changes the showrunners make, I think it's good that Jon avenges Jeor FUCKING Mormont.

Welcome, Ser Kennett!
5547	Patchfaith	2014-05-04	Random thought that just hit me: since Robb is dead, but House Stark has never given up on its claims, Bran is, at least theoretically, King of the North. Now he and his gang don't seem to know that (if they even cared), the mutineers should not know that, but certainly Jon must know.
Â 
Wonder if it might come up and tie into "First of his name" somehow.
Â 
I really like the speculation Oberyn will mention Dornish succession laws and "Queen" Myrcella.
5548	The Monkey	2014-05-04	I wonder if we'll see Olenna one last time then, maybe givingÂ Loras permission to discontinue his betrothal before she rides off back to Highgarden. Really her Oathkeeper scene with Marge is good enough as a last scene, but maybe she'll appear again to do this. I just wonder how the show could have Loras join the Kingsgaurd since their canon has established that he's the only Tyrell son. They could retcon Willas or Garlan as cousins, I guess.


Or have either Willas or Garlan be bastards. Margaery makes Tommen sign a document, legitimizing him, thus allowing Loras to join the Kingsguard without Margaery becoming the heir to Highgarden,

Gotta end with Lady Stoneheart. No two ways about it. It should make for an even bigger shock on the screen than it ever did on the page.

Â 
I don't see how it can tie up with "First of his name", when Bran would, if anyone considered him the King in the North, probably be the Twentieth of this Name or something like that. Brandon was a popular name with the Starks and we know that there were multiple Brandon Starks among the old Kings of Winter.
5553	acosta	2014-05-04	But at least it made sense. The Other scene was nonsense. Why would the wights and the Other just move around and then disappear? That scene made no sense at all.Â 


Not sure what you were watching, but they attacked the Fist of the First Men and slaughtered a few hundred crows, decimating Mormont's ranging party, adding to their own ranks, and leading to the mutiny at Craster's Keep. All in all, a pretty successful campaign on their part.Â
5554	Facelesss Fan	2014-05-04	any chance that Ayra 'sticking the Hound with the pointy end' could cause the festering wound that kills him?

I thought S2 cliffhanger was best as well, even though the opening to S3 was such a let down and dulled the impact of the cliffhanger in hindsight. How do you tease us with that cliffhanger then not show any of the battle the following season?

The only 'likely' scenario I've read about that would really make sense is Locke would see Bran, then Jon would realize that even south of the wall that Bran isn't safe. Then would send him on his way to Bloodraven.. Maybe with an escort from The Night's Watch.. Could protect them the way Coldhands did in the books..Â 
Then Locke would likely be killed (perhaps VIA longclaw) and Jon would be forewarned of the Bolton threat to come..

Â 
I bring this up because we see a glimpse of the Cersei/Oberyn scene in it. He'sÂ sitting outside writing a letterÂ and she and some Lannister guardsmen approach. He's probably writing home to Dorne here so this could naturally transition into her asking after her daughter and so on.

Hmm...could be. It will be interesting to see whether the Hound clearly dies onscreen in the show. Either way, it's a spoiler. If he clearly dies, it will be a Talisa-style spoiler that the Hound has no importance in post-ADWD events (since the writers like to tie things off where they possibly can, as they did when they implied Joffrey was behind the attempt on Tyrion's life, whereas in the books it's still a live question). If he's still alive when Arya leaves him, then he does have some part to play post-ADWD, since otherwise the writers would just kill him off.

Â 
Yes I think this is the point of that scene. To make it explicit and clear that Dany is NOT in a viable position to invade Westeros.
Â 
The problem, and its a glaringly obvious one, is that this would still bring accusations like "Why not just have given her more Unsullied?" "Why not have let the dragons grow faster?" Accusations of filler and dragging her plot out as they delay her return to Westeros will happen. I don't think show fans have grasped that season 4 and 5 will be her stuck in that city.Â

5608	TheWhiteRabbit	2014-05-04	I'm not worried about the Unsullied's reaction to the Danny procrastination this season, but season 5 all bets are off. It would be smart on their part if they at least start giving strong hints that she'll be heading home at the end of season 5/beginning of season 6.
5609	CrypticWeirwood	2014-05-04	Why should Jon get revenge? Why not Craster's wives? They are the victims. I say, "Fuck them till they're dead"(I mean the wives should do that to the mutineers)

So long as the wives use their bakerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s rolling pins for such bloody buggery, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m sure thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll be no complaints â<U+0080><U+0094> from the audience.
