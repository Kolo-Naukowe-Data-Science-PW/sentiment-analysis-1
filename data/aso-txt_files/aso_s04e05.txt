"TheWhiteRabbit",2014-05-04,"kind of an average episode honestly i was going to give it a 7 until the awesome ending so a very generous 8 definitely the weakest ep of the season cant wait for the trial next episode edit it deserves a 7 lol edited by thewhiterabbit 04 may 2014  0903 pm"
"Florina Laufeyson",2014-05-04,"that was a solid 9 due to all the shit they crammed into it this was the info dump episodeâ<U+0099> and while there wasnt a lot of action there was a lot of nuggets of stuff that help move the plot along plus the crasters keep business was awesome"

"YourMomsBox",2014-05-04,"it was a 6 or 7 an average episode and i kind of expected it after watching the preview the scenes at the vale were some of the best parts and contrary to what some are thinking i feel that the jon arryn reveal was timed fine most scenes were solid but uneventful and that while crasters keep was good it was also pretty predictable that there would be no reuniting that the bad guys get wiped out jon kills carl ghost kills rast easy to see coming dont have a issue with some slower episodes amidst the chaos next week should be excellent"

"Ser Blake",2014-05-04,"definitely the weakest of the season so far â it just had a weird feeling throughout and all of the scenes felt like they were just thrown together haphazardly â the long cersei scenes just didnt do anything for me â i understand they are showing she is trying to persuade the judges but they just all felt unnecessary â and they all fell flat to me â same goes for the brienne and pod scenes which were just meh to me â i did really enjoy all of the aryahoun and sansalittlefingerlysa scenes â with the exception of her spoiling the murder of jon arryn which i dont understand why they felt the need to reveal it early â its such a integral part of one of grrm best chapters and yet they just wasted it in the middle of a middle season episode like it was no big deal â i have no problem with changes but this one i just dont get â on the bright side the next episode should be best of the season â a bryan cogman written trial scene is sure to be phenomenalâ edited by ser blake 04 may 2014  0924 pm"

"Ran",2014-05-04,"the casterly rock thing is for the show no danger of the mines running out in the novels the reason tywin doesnt just buy the crown out all its debts in the books is that there are limits to how much wealth he has on hand hes already a substantial debt holder as it is and hes not going to cripple the house by tying up all of its wealth with the crown the reason cersei doesnt do the same is likely in emulation of that with the added bonus that she wellandtruly believes that she can tell the iron bank to go hang"

"The Killer Snark",2014-05-05,"i happen to agree with the bookreading slant against our current geniusofmanipulation cersei lena headey is excellent and im not downgrading the episode because i really enjoyed all her scenes in it but lets get it straight book cersei is an idiot she is like truly superstupid and transparently insane her cosying up to oberyn is actually in character because the martells dislike the tyrells and its the better alliance shes been offered by her father in the novels considering loras being a tyrell and being unquestionably gay among the wondrous prospects she gets given in the novels are marriage to either balon or theon greyjoy despite the fact that neither has yet been asked in the novels and the series oberyn is someone cersei has no personal prejudice against and apart from the fact hes not a robertstyle drunkard hes intelligent and also an attractive man its oberyn himself who has no interest in the arrangement which cersei is perfectly content with because he sees it rightly as a sweetener to stop him pursuing justice against tywin gregor and anyone else involved in the death of his sister the writers are quite rightly explicating material that happens offscreen in the books â her subtlety in attempting to manipulate others strikes a somewhat false note in line with the fact the cersei we know and laugh at is not a very intelligent person whose motives are always easy to read i really feel that the writers have been reluctant to have too much of book cerseis character on display in order to placate pcstyle feminists who have already complained about martins purported bias against female leader figures in the novels based on cersei but ignoring the fact that dany is one of the most able leaders in the series so theyre not trying to go too far down that road but it is a bit frustrating especially since it gives them less to work on with the affc adaptation the consistent zaniness of her chapters is by some distance the most interesting thing in that book edited by the killer snark 05 may 2014  0247 pm"

"MizasterJ",2014-05-06,"my thoughts onâ game of thronesâ season 4 episode 5 â contains no spoilers if youve seen the episode â â this episode even though it had dynamic  entertaining action near the end i felt that the actual plot was uneventful this midway point in the series is either a calm before the storm or a slumping low point in story before major uphill arcs â i was bothered by the lack of significance here it was mostly just a lot of talking for the sake of talking â however it was the standard quality acting that weve come to expect from the seriesâ where is varys this hole time why has he been absent like this entire season are they gearing him up for something big i cant imagine they are â i was really hoping to see theon  ramsay reach moat caitlin this time not sure why they are delaying that or even arya get on the ship but we are denied both those occurrences in favor ofjust banter â funny how hbo spared us actually seeing lysa and petyr knocking it while they make sure to show us details of the more glamourus people screwing lol vanity â the highlight of the episode was defintely seeing hodor snap chains and snap a neck while jon snow battled a ruthless killer excellent sword fight i cant help but feel a little disappointed that jon wasnt able to beat karl on his own he still has a ways to go in terms of fighting skill however it was satisfying to see karl skewered like that and to see ghost get his just desserts â the subplot with vargolocke came to a weak and abrupt end jon didnt even get to discover his treachery leaving us to ask what was the point maybe roose bolton will grow impatient and send others to find out what happened to his hunter â yet  i doubt it â would have been much better had they included a conflict between jon and locke a reason for them to pursue one another but with the massive war at the wall coming i guess the show runners dont have time  or patienceâ â cersei seeking out an ally in oberyn is rather odd a complete 180 from the book where oberyn favors tyrion no doubt this will turn around though â i believe this scene was simply just to remind viewers that the â martells have cerseis only daughter which will become very important in season 5 6 or 7 â lolâ where the heck is varys spying on them i hopedany â this is the point where most fans start moan and groan brace yourself hateful comments and condescending remarks from fans about danerys are comingâ â â you must give her credit she sees things through the girls got resolve but will hbo be able to atone for the infamously loathed mereen saga  â â review by sblackjackcomcastnet â"
"Hodor's Dragon",2014-05-06,"id give it an 85 but i voted 9 â i mightve overvoted in reaction to seeing a bunch of people in this thread dogging the episode in a way that was really undeserved in my view â theyreâ really upping the game this year â and its not just that the budgets are bigger â the writing and direction are really crisp â the first couple of years this show really didnt have all that much for people who had read the books â some good nudity a welldown battle of the blackwater decent sets but the main thing that hooked in the numbers was the rockin plot and if youd read the books you knew the plot because there were few deviations â other than going over the top a bit with sex and gore it was pretty much traditional tv with the got characters largely being shoehorned into tv stereotypes â often they fit well because of course grrms background is largely tv â 3rd season the show was a little better with a few really excellentlydone scenes â but this year it has blossomed â this is excellent tv that deserves to be compared with what i consider the classics of the recent tv renaissance the sopranos the wire rome etc â as for this episode i loved it til we got to the north â no cersei isnt being inexplicably nice shes trying to get tyrion put to death but those scenes were written in a way that softens cerseis character a bit  as it was in the book where you get a good luck at what makes cersei be the way she is â lena headey wsa excellent â the scenes in the vale were fantastic especially the handholding scene and sansa listening to lysas howling â a couple of really nice moments in the aryahound scene too â daenerys scene didnt work all that well but its setup and the same can be said for brienne and pod â the directors have overdone the queenly badass conquerer bit for daenerys they need to bring back more of the scared emotional girl with enough inner strength to get by that lives in the books â i mightve been inclined to give this episode a 10 but the north bits left me flat â im not a big action fan but i can appreciate good action that wasnt it neither the big fight outside nor the duel inside â the part at the end where everybody is toasting marshmallows by crasters burning house just made no sense at all and bran deciding not to reveal himself to jon was set up poorly and just reeked of viewerteasing â the only bit of that whole scene i really liked was hodors reaction to realizing how he had been used â oh and the fight between ghost and rast â â"

"StrollofShame",2014-05-06,"not sure what your nonsense refers to but if its about the lf being behind everything big reveal it should really have been left for way later in the season ideally ep10 â in the books it marks a milestone in plot advancement arguably the biggest reveal at that point here it will just be overlooked and probably forgotten by most unsullied plus this means only cat in ep7 and i happen to very much like that scene was hoping they would keep it for ep10 i read on another thread that quite possibly the reveal was done early exactly so the unsullied would hear it loudly  clearly  not have to recall it among the many more exciting reveals which will captivate all of us in the season final i dont recall which genius poster said it but that made enormous sense to me my unsullied bf will remember it now  not have to try to recall it later when his head will be exploding from the season end action it may be rendered less important if combined with other events which will shock far more greatly kudos to the originator of this splendid theory"

like a bossâ a backstabby bossâ conclusionâ jon know nothing snow learning how to not fight with honor when necessaryâ heres hoping anyway its a valuable lesson to learn especially when youre fixin to be the hero of this whole shebangâ now that ghost is back there should be plenty of opportunity for effective dishonorable flankingâ was half expecting ghost to bring the pain on the fooking legend of gin alley â<U+0099> but theres fine closure in it being a daughterwife â really enjoyed the finer points of how and why they kept jon and bran from meetingâ locke fudging his recon report to lead jon away from where hed find him and bran making the sacrificetough decision not to let jon know hes aliveâ which is back in concert with the books even though brans making the decision in a different spot and with different people around â and mentioned already in passing but how about the loafer of the direwolves ghost finally putting in some workâ welcome back whiteyâ as soon as edds mutineer head count came up short and rast was named as the short head you just knew what was comingâ no killstealing here ghost finally got to add a deserved notch to his scoresheet â screw dany hodor is the true breaker of chainsâ did not expect locke to go down this quickly but its a good time and a good way to write him outâ dummy made his move on starksassination too quickly wheres rickon and paid the priceâ also liked hodor staring accusingly and fearfully at his hands reminding us that regulatin on locke is very much not his nature and laying the groundwork for how this is not okay even though it was for the greater good this week bran is going down an unpleasant path by warging into hodor â i guess locke wont be the man whose ear brienne bites off after allâ even though it sounds like shes heading that wayâ she thinks sansas heading off to meet jon at the wallâ dead wrong of course as we know but its a better plan than her book planâ come to think of it why didnt she think of that possibility in the booksâ i guess cat wouldnt have mentioned jons existence but then how did she learn about jon as a possibility in the showâ maybe jaime remembered him i guess â so ser milady has a plan and a stillunclaimed reservation at ear restaurantâ plenty to look forward to â mace tyrell showed up this weekâ maybe next week hell get to actually talkâ hes the one judge we didnt see cersei

remembered myrcella existsâ way to take the first step on that path to not being a shitty mom â kinda was hoping for a tensionbreaking joke or any sort of light hearted oneliner from the newly crowned king tommen iâ i guess the smile is enough for now â in other kingsguard recaps pod goes the idiotsavant route by being completely useless to brienne and annoying her until she finally asks did you do anything useful as tyrions squire to which pod of course reminds us of the time he made the world a better place by ganking mandon moore with a spear though moore goes unnamedâ and then brienne throws him a bone by letting him undo her strapsâ dawwwwww â oberyn appeared in this episode and did not have sex with anyoneâ fortunately his average lays per episode alpe is still in fine shape thanks to that foursome that got interrupted by tywin two weeks ago â speaking of which tywin is at last admitting that the iron bank is a problemâ when tywin says you do not fuck with these guys guess whatâ it means you really dont fuck with these guysâ and we get a tangible reason why even in a postwar scenario the lannisters still need the tyrellsâ the gold mines are over the crown still owes that debt robert racked up so letting the second richest family marry into the crown means they can use the tyrells to pay off the debtâ of course once upon a time the tyrells were a major creditor of roberts crown themselvesâ so much for getting that back â and dany knows that joffrey is deadâ barristan the smug thinks they can take kings landing nowâ daario takes a shot at us book readers waiting decades

ready to go as of last week there is no reason for dany to hold back a second longer shes finally got everything she needs to retake her homeland while its at its most vulnerable so here we go at last with the invaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaait a minuteâ jorah the fedorah looking even more haggard than usual once upon a time the man on this team most eager to get the fuck back to westeros so much so

enough for klâ we definitely dont have enough for the whole countryâ he does not mention that the proposed invasion plan is probably pretty stupid because stannis the mannis recently tried the exact same thing and if he couldnt get it to work it aint working â in the end dany decides to do what is really the responsible thingâ also the boring thingâ fedorah tells her about how yunkai and astapor have slipped back into the same old shit without her literally squatting on them to make her reforms stickâ how can i rule seven kingdoms if i cant hold my own castle slavers bayâ careful dany youre skirting close to robb stark territoryâ just make sure you dont get smitten with somebody below your station and blow your chance at a powe aww dammit â barristan really is getting very noncanon these daysâ hasnt kicked an ass since killing that manticore in s3 e1 all he seems to do is get sauced in danys tent and act as chief administrator of dissing the enemy in danys council meetingsâ jorah

him like a bossâ a backstabby bossâ conclusionâ jon know nothing snow learning how to not fight with honor when necessaryâ heres hoping anyway its a valuable lesson to learn especially when youre fixin to be the hero of this whole shebangâ now that ghost is back there should be plenty of opportunity for effective dishonorable flankingâ was half expecting ghost to bring the pain on the fooking legend of gin alley â<U+0099> but theres fine closure in it being a daughterwife â really enjoyed the finer points of how and why they kept jon and bran from meetingâ locke fudging his recon report to lead jon away from where hed find him and bran making the sacrificetough decision not to let jon know hes aliveâ which is back in concert with the books even though brans making the decision in a different spot and with different people around â and mentioned already in passing but how about the loafer of the direwolves ghost finally putting in some workâ welcome back whiteyâ as soon as edds mutineer head count came up short and rast was named as the short head you just knew what was comingâ no killstealing here ghost finally got to add a deserved notch to his scoresheet â screw dany hodor is the true breaker of chainsâ did not expect locke to go down this quickly but its a good time and a good way to write him outâ dummy made his move on starksassination too quickly wheres rickon and paid the priceâ also liked hodor staring accusingly and fearfully at his hands reminding us that regulatin on locke is very much not his nature and laying the groundwork for how this is not okay even though it was for the greater good this week bran is going down an unpleasant path by warging into hodor â i guess locke wont be the man whose ear brienne bites off after allâ even though it sounds like shes heading that wayâ she thinks sansas heading off to meet jon at the wallâ dead wrong of course as we know but its a better plan than her book planâ come to think of it why didnt she think of that possibility in the booksâ i guess cat wouldnt have mentioned jons existence but then how did she learn about jon as a possibility in the showâ maybe jaime remembered him i guess â so ser milady has a plan and a stillunclaimed reservation at ear restaurantâ plenty to look forward to â mace tyrell showed up this weekâ maybe next week hell get to actually talkâ hes the one judge we didnt see cersei talk to this week she still owes him a lobbyinâ also got half of loras head in one shotâ thats a pretty successful week for male tyrells â meryn trantâ the so called best swordsman of all

being overjoyed to see uncle petyr adoring the little glass falcon gift but immediately losing interest in it and chucking it out the moon door â speaking of which lysa is crazy as hellâ manic muchâ from almost breaking sansas hands to cradling her head in secondsâ oh and how about getting the big reveal about how she lied in letter to cat and actually was the one who poisoned jon arryn â cersei remembered myrcella existsâ way to take the first step on that path to not being a shitty mom â kinda was hoping for a tensionbreaking joke or any sort of light hearted oneliner from the newly crowned king tommen iâ i guess the smile is enough for now â in other kingsguard recaps pod goes the idiotsavant route by being completely useless to brienne and annoying her until she finally asks did you do anything useful as tyrions squire to which pod of course reminds us of the time he made the world a better place by ganking mandon moore with a spear though moore goes unnamedâ and then brienne throws him a bone by letting him undo her strapsâ dawwwwww â oberyn appeared in this episode and did not have sex with anyoneâ fortunately his average lays per episode alpe is still in fine shape thanks to that foursome that got interrupted by tywin two weeks ago â speaking of which tywin is at last admitting that the iron bank is a problemâ when tywin says you do not fuck with these guys guess whatâ it means you really dont fuck with these guysâ and we get a tangible reason why even in a postwar scenario the lannisters still need the tyrellsâ the gold mines are over the crown still owes that debt robert racked up so letting the second richest family marry into the crown means they can use the tyrells to pay off the debtâ of course once upon a time the tyrells were a major creditor of roberts crown themselvesâ so much for getting that back â and dany knows that joffrey is deadâ barristan the smug thinks they can take kings landing nowâ daario takes a shot at us book readers waiting decades for danys invasion by mentioning off hand oh yeah that fleet you needâ i got thatâ 93 shipsâ 8000 unsullied and 2000 mercs drogon is aâ big boy and the offcial flag of team targaryen is stitched and ready to go as of last week there is no reason for dany to hold back a second longer shes finally got everything she needs to retake her homeland while its at its most vulnerable so here we go at last with the invaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaait a minuteâ jorah the fedorah looking even more haggard than usual once upon a time the man on this team most eager to get the fuck back to westeros so much so that he was spying on dany for varys where did that plot element goâ did salladhor saan steal it on his way out of the show is now saying dont go back to westerosâ jorah does mention we might not have enough for klâ we definitely dont have enough for the whole countryâ he does not mention that the proposed invasion plan is probably pretty stupid because stannis the mannis recently tried the exact same thing and if he couldnt get it to work it aint working â in the end dany decides to do what is really the responsible thingâ also the boring thingâ fedorah tells her about how yunkai and astapor have slipped back into the same old shit without her literally squatting on them to make her reforms stickâ how can i rule seven kingdoms if i cant hold my own castle slavers bayâ careful dany youre skirting close to robb stark territoryâ just make sure you dont get smitten with somebody below your station and blow your chance at a powe aww dammit â barristan really is getting very noncanon these daysâ hasnt kicked an ass since killing that manticore in s3 e1 all he seems to do is get sauced in danys tent and act as chief administrator of dissing the enemy in danys council meetingsâ jorah doesnt even feel threatened by him and his potential to blow jorahs secret anymoreâ weirdâ the actors sold that element well with some solid eyesonly acting last year â but i may have enjoyed the next week preview most of all what with the glimpses of two longmissing faces im overeager to see again â awesome post so much to respond to but all i can say is fk this new daario"

hero of this whole shebangâ now that ghost is back there should be plenty of opportunity for effective dishonorable flankingâ was half expecting ghost to bring the pain on the fooking legend of gin

breaker of chainsâ did not expect locke to go down this quickly but its a good time and a good way to write him outâ dummy made his move on starksassination too quickly wheres rickon and paid the priceâ also liked hodor staring accusingly and fearfully at his hands reminding us that regulatin on locke is very much not his nature and laying the groundwork for how this is not okay even though it was for the greater good this week bran is going down an unpleasant path by warging into hodor â i guess locke wont be the man whose ear brienne bites off after allâ even though it sounds like shes heading that wayâ she thinks sansas heading off to meet jon at the wallâ dead wrong of course as we know but its a better plan than her book planâ come to think of it why didnt she think of that possibility in the booksâ i guess cat wouldnt have mentioned jons existence but then how did she learn about jon as a possibility in the showâ maybe jaime remembered him i guess â so ser milady has a plan and a stillunclaimed reservation at ear restaurantâ plenty to look forward to â mace tyrell showed up this weekâ maybe next week hell get to actually talkâ hes the one judge we didnt see cersei

being overjoyed to see uncle petyr adoring the little glass falcon gift but immediately losing interest in it and chucking it out the moon door â speaking of which lysa is crazy as hellâ manic muchâ from almost breaking sansas hands to cradling her head in secondsâ oh and how about getting the big reveal about how she lied in letter to cat and actually was the one who poisoned jon arryn â cersei remembered myrcella existsâ way to take the first step on that path to not being a shitty mom â kinda was hoping for a tensionbreaking joke or any sort of light hearted oneliner from the newly crowned king tommen iâ i guess the smile is enough for now â in other kingsguard recaps pod goes the idiotsavant route by being completely useless to brienne and annoying her until she finally asks did you do

him a bone by letting him undo her strapsâ dawwwwww â oberyn appeared in this episode and did not have sex with anyoneâ fortunately his average lays per episode alpe is still in fine shape thanks to that foursome that got interrupted by tywin two weeks ago â speaking of which tywin is at last admitting that the iron bank is a problemâ when tywin says you do not fuck with these guys guess whatâ it means you really dont fuck with these guysâ and we get a tangible reason why even in a postwar scenario the lannisters still need the tyrellsâ the gold mines are over the crown still owes that debt robert racked up so letting the second richest family marry into the crown means they can use the tyrells to pay off the debtâ of course once upon a time the tyrells were a major creditor of roberts

enough for klâ we definitely dont have enough for the whole countryâ he does not mention that the proposed invasion plan is probably pretty stupid because stannis the mannis recently tried the exact same thing and if he couldnt get it to work it aint working â in the end dany decides to do what is really the responsible thingâ also the boring thingâ fedorah tells her about how yunkai and astapor have slipped back into the same old shit without her literally squatting on them to make her reforms stickâ how can i rule seven kingdoms if i cant hold my own castle slavers bayâ careful dany youre skirting close to robb stark territoryâ just make sure you dont get smitten with somebody below your station and blow your chance at a powe aww dammit â barristan really is getting very noncanon these daysâ hasnt kicked an ass since killing that manticore in s3 e1 all he seems to do is get sauced in danys tent and act as chief administrator of dissing the enemy in danys council meetingsâ jorah

"Ser_Hector",2014-06-07,"yes you are totally right just based on reach alone a skilled swordsman would at least be able to maintain distance between him and the person with the knives plus it would be easy to hit the person with the knives the moment he comes that near with the intention to stab you because the moment he tries to strike he loses his defense that is an important part of swordplay and its the main reason why in a fight the sword wielders never tried to connect a massive hit because in order to do that you need to get the sword very far â from your body leaving you awfully vulnerable â it was a very exciting fight scene either ways haha"

"Ran",2014-05-04,"exactly i mean i suppose they went to one another well why didnt tywin just buy the crown out of debt because in the book he actively refuses to cancel the crowns debts to him but i think thats obviously because he isnt going to cripple the lannisters by erasing debt while everyone else gets to hold the crowns debts to them it makes the lannisters relatively weaker compared to the rest and thats never going to happen â so maybe they went well why doesnt cersei cancel the debt at least and probably because she loves being lady of casterly rock and isnt going to weaken herself relative to the other debt holders either better to weaken them by telling them to fuck off or to take stuff shes very happy to give in return for debt forgiveness but no thats too significant a pettiness to allow to stand â i could of course be wrong but theres obviously been a pattern from day 1 with their treatment of cersei of filing down the rough edges so to speak and this conveniently seems to fit that pattern edited by ran 04 may 2014  1135 pm"

"SynthFG",2014-05-06,"this isnt the case in the booksâ we know the mines are still pumping out gold like its nobodies business because robb secures a few mines when hes raiding the westerlands and they comment on itâ the only mines that have failed are those belonging to the cragâ â so for the show even if the mines under casterly rockall the mines in all of westeros or just the casterly rock mines have failed they still have the immense profits from all the trade going through lannisportâ â so 1 dumb change that didnt need to happen we will see lannister power erode in other ways 2 doesnt even do a good job of showing lannisters running out of money because they still have a huge secondary source of revenuesâ â actually all the books really say is that the umbars have taken the mines i dont imagine they left them functioning when they pulled out we also know that his army drove significant herds of cattle back with themâ â it very much looks like robs campaign in the west would have closely mirrored the mountainsâ chevaucheeâ â in the riverlands its just that we never get a pov of it to see the damage but its clear from the bits we get that the remaining lannister forces in the west pulled back behind fortified walls and robs forces battered everything else â ergo the lannister tax base has been as thoroughly destroyed as â that of the riverlands if not more so â theres nothing left to tradewith it s clear that the lannister cash reserves were spent on the war and so casterly rock may well be facing a liquidity crisis that tywin and kevin have been hiding from cerci and the rest of the world edited by synthfg 06 may 2014  0611 am"

"Dorne Sand",2014-05-06,"again i agree with many here â most dont mind changes but we find those changes botched in so many ways with very little value added the show could have stated that the war have strained badly their ressources that robb sacking their castle has done more damage that they let know that stannis is still on the field and they may have to save coin in order to face him if the aim is to underline the need of the tyrels suffice to say they are the key to the south the north is still unsetteled and dorne is dubious at best make it about food and supplies if you want make it about bad harvest to come make it something else â why make them completly out of gold what does that bring to the show compared to how it damages character evolution and actions why create such potential butterfly effects with so very little value added â it is the same for what happens in the wall the hole gilly to mole town and then oh crap i forgot they were wildlings attacking villages then lets make it to crasters for whatever reason just when bran is there and ghost is in a cage well fed â for me dd have botched the after purple wedding episodes this seaon is very confusing and sometimes boring even for a non book reader  i happen to watch the show with one the trade offs made vs the book do not bring anything to the show imho if the craster thing was to bring some good action and rythm well it was badely build as a plot and not that good watching â what is critized is not the change or the show not being canon it is what i consider botched writingâ"
"Cas Stark",2014-05-06,"right â it isnt â that all change is bad but changes like thiswhich is really a huge change there is no more gold eg the lannisters no matter what they do can never regain or maintain their position is too much when the purpose is most likely to simply emphasize the iron banks power â it will totally change cerseis motivations for what she does in the future making her destroying the tyrell alliance even crazier than it was in the book â it occurred to me that the books could reveal this later on but im not sure even grrm could plausibly put together a scenario where the mines have been dry for 3 years and somehow tywin has managed to keep this a secrethow could he do this â the miners would know theyre either not finding gold anymore or not mining at all and to keep this quiet would require tons of money on its own for payoffs and security etc â it could be that in the future the mines will dry up as the final blow to the lannisters but pulling it forward this much makes too much difference in cerseis storyline"

"DrownedSnow",2014-05-06,"the lannisters would have such huge stacks of gold it wouldnt be all gone right away so the three years things make sense they have plenty of other income to sustain themselves outside of war time but with war they couldnt maintain paying for the expenses of the kingdom forever i still think this change has more to do with explaining why tywin and eventually kevan didnt pay off the iron bank they are looking to make that a point before the end of the season so it would be before tywin is killed and cersei has a chance to tell the bank where to stick it it would make zero sense to the tv audience that tywin didnt pay them if he could â â basically what do you think show viewers would find less believable that tywin kept the empty mines quiet or that he wouldnt use his infinite gold to avoid making a big enemy how many people will even question that ruthless tywin killed off anyone he needed to keep it quiet or just used already mined gold to make it appear they were still working or something doubt most will give it a thought when the iron bank starts to turn the tides against the lannisters they all would have been shouting why didnt tywin pay them off with his endless supply of gold edited by drownedsnow 06 may 2014  0849 am"

"trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell",2014-05-08,"well perhaps i made my point no clear enough â tv cersei is a completely erratic character whats the point of her bonding time with margaery in last weeks episode if their last conversation ended with if you call me sister again ill have you strangled in your sleep i honestly dont get it â its the same with tyrioncersei cersei loathes her brother because he has killed their mother at his birth that has been established in season 2 but if thats the case why the hell does cersei spend her leisure time with tyrion in season 3 after he has threatened to turn her joy to ashes in her mouth they even bond over the whole forcedarranged marriage issue she repeatedly visits him talks to him even drinks with him i know that lena and peter are very good friends in real life and this shows in their scenes together  there is just no real enmityloathing between these two characters â and is there a hidden agenda does she even want power or did she just kill robert because ned threatened her life jaimes life and the life of her children by telling her that he would tell robert tv cersei never made a real grasp for power she did not delight in presiding over the small council or calling the shots in kl she was only afraid afraid of joffrey afraid of tyrion afraid of stannisâ â i try to understand the characters as ddcharacters now they created them they changed them to fit their vision  surely they have some sort of concept for each character â ill try to address your points best i can â regarding cerseimargery that attempt at bonding was clearly a farceit was her pathetic attempt at trying to win the tyrells by proxy of margery vote in the trial against tyrion i will grant you that it does technically make more sense for her to go straight to mace but in the show it would have been extremely odd to suddenly give him some real onscreen timeif you watch it again you will notice margerys clear suspicion on her faceand the sister comment just watch margerys evil smirk while she says it and the way she checks cerseis expression as she doesnti would say this is very on par with cerseis character so far at believing shes the best manipulator and is capable of moulding anyone to do her bidding directly or indirectly hence having her every whimwish fulfilled  i would say its her powerlust for powerâ â tyrioncerseii would say there is extreme loathingdistrust between themif you remember beginning of s2 when he arrives as hand of the king horrible fightsdespite everything she does know hes cunningso a lot of those scenes i remember seem to be cersei battling her wits against tyrion and trying to outsmart him when she believes she captured shae which again i would say is again a powerego tripif you recall she threatens him as well when myrcella is being shipped offsomething on the lines of i hope you truly care about someone someday so i can take them away from youtyrion still hung out with her i think it was more a case of keep your friends close and your enemies closer they both met frequently to try to uncover each others plots and outsmart each othernow s3 do you remember cerseis smug expression when tywin told him he has to marry sansa clearly the expression of someone who hated tyrion and firmly believes that shes outsmarted him againthen the other shoe falls and she realizes that her scheming backfired you see the build up for the future here dont youi will agree that bookcersei and booktyrion would never have that bonding moment they did which one of the 4 of us are more fukd i have no defense for that scene only thing is that if you found that scene out of character for cersei then same should be thought of tyrion as well â i do believe that all she wants is power do you recall the scene with lf demonstrating her power just for the heck of itshowcerseis motivations for killing robert seem to be a combination of her fear of robert finding out about her kids being jaimes bastards but ned did offer her the chance to flee she threw it back in his face and decided to stay and kill the king indicating a very strong lust of power after jofferey is crowned she does lord about for a short while till tyrion shows up then shes distracted battling her wits against hisalso when she hits jofferey he did manage to threaten her in a very creepy and effective mannerin her discussions with tywin in s3 and s4 so far she seems to talking about how she deserves her daddys respect and trust and so forthwhile some unsullied might misunderstand that as just a girl trying to win her daddys affection and attention most that ive spoken to seem to think that shes under the impression that if she can win over tywin shes gona have a hell of a lot of weightpower to throw around â so i guess im trying to say that showcerseis motivations appear to be a strong lust for power and to be the queen bee but shes quite easily distracted and definitely not as smart as she thinks she is â this is all just imoone thing that your are probably aware off is that lena headly hasnt read the books at allshe goes by completely on the script and her interpretation and ofcourse discussions with dd â if you feel you got a different vibe from her i would love to hear itim planning another marathon 23 weeks after this season is over ill definitely try to watch for any points you bring upâ"
"RedShirt47",2014-05-08,"meh i dont see this as a major change it brings the importance of the tyrells and iron bank more into focus for the tv audience i dont see it changing cerseis actions that much the crown should be servicing its debts out of its tax income not out of lannister mines the crown should be getting taxes in from all seven kingdoms and from trade by merchants in and out of westeros cersei refusing to pay the iron bank should not be anything to do with lannisters being broke or not the crown should be able to pay the iron bank regardless if in future it turns out that the lannisters need to have lots of gold for some reason then they could always find a new rich vein of gold"

"AZAXD",2014-05-05,"assuming it proves the jojen paste theory wrong the fire could mean he eventually becomes a wight and is burnt to finish him off or dies and is burnt to prevent turning or maybe the fire represents how hot jojen gets during his seizures because he did look to be awfully run down and sweaty before and during crasters maybe by the time they get to the great weirwood this catches up with him it seems sort of inevitable to me that the whole gang aside from bran will get kind of lost andor dead at the end of the journey edited by azaxd 05 may 2014  1243 pm"

"Schokolade!",2014-05-05,"i think the speech was directed at bran now the simple explanation for the fire is that he saw crasters keep burning but since the speech was directed at bran it could mean that either bran will end by fire or bran might control fire aka mount or warg a dragon havent seen anyone mention that yet anyway i think fire in this scene symbolizes summer and jojens speech indicates that bran will be the only survivor by the time summer comes or bran will bring summer back ironic since the motto of his house is winter is coming i have to agree with you i think you might be on to something here what i understood from jojen speech is that bran will out live them all with him constantly repeating that it isnt the end of bran his hand burning was very ambiguous it could mean many things the most plausible imo is that brans journey will end with fire maybe hell fight against rhorll or hell wragmount a dragon didnt the 3ec tell bran in the books that hell never walk again but he will fly or it could mean that jojen will die and theyll have to burn him and as you said maybe hell bring back summer bran seems to be linked to summer a lot old nan keeps calling him a child of summer if i remember correctly because hes born in summer and has never known winter or something like that he also takes an awful lot of time to name his direwolf and ends up naming him summer his house saying is winter is coming the last book will be call a dream of summer coincidence"

see a corpse long since dead but still very much alive hes what exceeding 130 yo or of the like at this point i see him chained and imprisoned to that throne as a corpse i see him bound in that cave

to him it makes sense that that was the extent of his powers to contact bran through dreams if his body was imprisoned in that weirwood â so bran sees his visions collects hodor jojen and meera and

"Tixu Oty",2014-05-06,"i think the burning hand is intended to be taken literally  jojen has seen his own death and its by fire snip i watch jojens hand burning and dont have a damn clue if thats something they just made up because it looks cool or if theyre seriously spoiling events to come in the books â i havent watched the last two episodes with my unsullied sis yet and as i was watching on my own i was imagining in my head all the questions she might ask me and i realized for most of them my answer would have to be you know at this point were pretty much on the same level and i dont know any better than you because the shows getting close to catching up to the books and its adding lots of stuff in there that could be either foreshadowing or madeup stuff so im like her i dont have a clue and i love it â do i recall the books incorrectly but wasnt jojens death supposed to be back at the neck â hmm yes there was a vague quote from jojen to meera that could be interpreted in a number a ways i dont remember exactly what he told her but i basically took it to mean that 1he wasnt going to die right away 2possibly not until its time to start going back home 3and that hed never make it back home anyway â what i understood from jojen speech is that bran will out live them all with him constantly repeating that it isnt the end of bran his hand burning was very ambiguous it could mean many things â this whole conversation was so incredibly vague and confusing we dont know who is talking about what totally surreal yes its meant to be ambiguous i think show only people are supposed to wonder what the hell thats all about and then when karl is killed and the keep is burned they can think back on it and interpret it as jojen predicting the bad guys end first layer then i guess somewhere down the line something happens to jojen or to team bran and were meant to think back on it again and see the double meaning second layer i love it so for that second layer as a book reader the first thing that came to my mind was this is how jojen dies i thought this because the fact that jojen knows how and when he will die was incredibly tense and sad its a huge part of what makes the character compelling and all of team brans journey too you guys have incredible theory but i guess ill stick to that its the most obvious interpretation i think especially since the show has otherwise done a great job at letting us know that jojens time may be almost up see below â finally someone else thinks jojens paste is bullshit i dont know why most fans ive ever talked to before always acted like this theory is book canon â i dont think jojenpaste is true in the books and its starting to look like its even less likely to be true in the show but i think the theory still makes a lot of sense because 1 we know for a fact jojen is going to die before all is said and done and knowing that we stress out wondering when is the day jojen dies 2 that last bran chapter was incredibly weird and dark even more so than his previous chapter in the caves add to that the fact that the reed siblings were nowhere to be seen which is definitely very weird i think something very wrong might be going on but its not the jojenpaste its just a feeling though nothing to prove or disprove anything â its funny how most show fans believe that the north story lines are pointless and only the thrones matter when in fact the books tell us the throne is irrelevant in the bigger picture â yes i love that and thats why the last episode really surprised me a lot i mean the previous episode already upped the magic quite a bit with the white walkers and baby scene but now they are breaking their own laws the show had gotten us used to the fact that is was pretty low on magic compared to the books apart from bran none of the stark siblings warg or have crazy dreams there are no flashback scenes at all even when it doesnt involve magic its a pretty straightforward tale with no visual tricks to give it a fantasy look but in that scene we had the tree appearing out of nowhere in the background while all characters were awake that was a first and then theres the burning hand previous posters have said that in future scenes they wonder what else jojen might be seeing that we dont know of and thats telling because obviously hes been seeing things all the time but now dd are choosing to show us wow im thrilled because it looks like the show is definitely taking a new direction â youre not here was imo the most interesting part added to the the raven is you could mean a lot about bran being time lord bran â yes i was wondering what the hell does that mean and i still have no idea but i have faith in dd and i think come on this gotta be a clue right â in my view jojen is a sacrificial character who understands precisely the role he must play and the last bran chapter is so sinister that it would be absurd to deny the possibility of awful things going on in the background â i agree that scene and the weird ominous dialogue talking about ends and whatnot was definitely foreboding and getting us ready for things to go wrong â regardless of the burning hand what ive been wondering is why does jojen always look so sickly and pale is he already actually dying of some illness did they suggest something in the show that ive already missed â you know iirc i dont even think jojen has fits of epilepsy in the book right i took the epilepsy and the feverish look as a visual hint that jojens death is near it works just so much better to have him always looking sickly right from the start than to simply have him talk about him knowing the manner of his death i love when movies or shows give you subtle visual hints to make you process things without even being aware of it"

"voodooqueen126",2014-05-06,"i realize the aryahound scenes are a favorite of show viewers but i cant stand them one of my issues with the aryahound shownarrative is they almost reversed the characters first bookhound never physically harmed the peasant he stole the cart from to get into the rw the show portrayed him as a coldblooded murderer and arya as some beacon of justice so showhound is not only a thief but hes a coldblooded murderer as well then hes apparently a man with a code who doesnt steal even though the audience already knows he steals even though the audience already knows he lost all his gold because he was robbed by the bwb arya who was there when he was robbed cant figure out why he has no gold and apparently the hound forgot as well then in the next scene hes stealing from another villager and harms him a man who not only offers guest rights but offers him fair work for fair wages bookhound accepts this and never harms anyone bookarya hates the idea of spending any time in the village showarya is relieved by the prospectâ â but what â really sent me over the edge with showhound is him slapping arya arya suffers beatings by yoren and her captures at harrenhall but as much as she tries to kill and get under the skin of the hound he never hits her never regardless of his emotional state he never raises a had to her it pissed me off to no end that showhound slapped arya so out of characterâ â so true book sandor is sufficiently morally ambiguous why must they make him worse"

"coppersam",2014-05-06,"i personally loved the scenes between the hound and arya in this episode â it was a nice reminder for viewers that this is not a buddy comedy and there is no love between these two â arya wasis clearly willing to stick him with the pointy end at the first opportunity she gets and the hound is not here as a mentor he is her captor and is literally knocking her back into reality before she gets herself killed â if she dies he doesnt get paid and we have already seen her independently attack armed and armoured men so he definitely has an interest in protecting her â as to the complaint about him hitting her i dont see how this is out of character for either book or tv hound â he has regularly shown brutality to other characters including children and this is not the first time he has smacked arya in the dome to save her red wedding with an axe nonetheless and here to remind her what might happen against a real opponent â the chemistry that these two have on screen i think makes it easy to forget that they are not friends so this scene was great to remind us where they stand â a few other thoughts the syrio mention in my opinion was not meant to troll or lead us to believe that he is still alive â again it was a reality check for arya â i think it will help add to her motivation that she needs to leave and go to braavos to be trained â it makes it easier for nonbook readers to understand why she needs to leave â also syrio is dead people â sad but true â i think to have him come back later as a faceless man or something similar would just piss me off â everyone that is dead cannot keep coming back like some crazy affirmation of the iron borns what is dead may never die incantation â i was very impressed to see maisie williams water dancing â she is such a talented young actress and im sure it takes quite a bit of training to even learn how to gracefully and adeptly handle the sword â im sure her dancing background helped a lot really enjoyed aryas discussion with the hound about having to say the names and then still tacking on his own at the end â his reaction was great too edited by coppersam 06 may 2014  1120 am"
"Envie",2014-05-06,"no i wasnt surprised by this scene even with that trolling teaser they put in last weeks preview having the scene cut off abruptly when she stabbed needle at his gut was just a hilarious trick and i knew she wasnt going to stab him for real sure theyve had characters do things in the show that were never in the book but i was almost 100 sure this wouldnt be one of them arya and the hound are too important and too good for the television shows popularity so yes as someone else said i think theyre going to milk it for all they can before they part ways and arya heads for braavos â as i said in the other thread about this topic  i think the scene was very useful to show arya getting another harsh lesson about fighting shes not going to be able to water dance her way through her hit list how does she hope to achieve being a killer if shes so small and has only a small sword that cant pierce armor shes going to have to learn another way its a lead in for her assassination career shell remember this shes very smart and she wants to find ways to use her size and quickness to her advantage shes obviously rogue material not warrior this it to show the audience why she has motivation to learn from the faceless men"
"Tixu Oty",2014-05-06,"i agree with you coppersam this scene is definitely meant primarily as a realitycheck it also helps to remind us once again of braavos but all that doesnt exclude a side of trolling which might very well have been unintentional the effect is that same to me it was fun plus its nice to remind us of syrio who was a very enjoyable character so this scene is a winner on all counts ps i agree that syrios most certainly dead but the only thing i know for sure is that i dont know a thing i keep an open mind about anything just in case â â the syrio mention in my opinion was not meant to troll or lead us to believe that he is still alive â again it was a reality check for arya â i think it will help add to her motivation that she needs to leave and go to braavos to be trained â it makes it easier for nonbook readers to understand why she needs to leave â also syrio is dead people â sad but true â i think to have him come back later as a faceless man or something similar would just piss me off â everyone that is dead cannot keep coming back like some crazy affirmation of the iron borns what is dead may never die incantation â edited by tixu oty 06 may 2014  1138 am"

"Onion Seaworth",2014-05-07,"i realize the aryahound scenes are a favorite of show viewers but i cant stand them one of my issues with the aryahound shownarrative is they almost reversed the characters first bookhound never physically harmed the peasant he stole the cart from to get into the rw the show portrayed him as a coldblooded murderer and arya as some beacon of justice so showhound is not only a thief but hes a coldblooded murderer as well then hes apparently a man with a code who doesnt steal even though the audience already knows he steals even though the audience already knows he lost all his gold because he was robbed by the bwb arya who was there when he was robbed cant figure out why he has no gold and apparently the hound forgot as well then in the next scene hes stealing from another villager and harms him a man who not only offers guest rights but offers him fair work for fair wages bookhound accepts this and never harms anyone bookarya hates the idea of spending any time in the village showarya is relieved by the prospectâ â but what â really sent me over the edge with showhound is him slapping arya arya suffers beatings by yoren and her captors at harrenhall but as much as she tries to kill and get under the skin of the hound he never hits her never regardless of his emotional state he never raises a had to her it pissed me off to no end that showhound slapped arya so out of characterâ so you dont like dark fantasy at all if you say you do then you are bullshitting dark story and dark fantasy is filled with racism blood gritty and horrifying with all hope for the good guys is extinguished whilst the bad guys live and the moral grey people like the hound is the people who live in dark fantasy look at the witcher and at game of thronesasioaf its like it is for a reason"
"Le Cygne",2014-05-07,"how is it that saying they reversed the characterization for the hound and arya on the show is not liking dark fantasy it was actually more interesting with the woman being the darker characterarya and the hound were heading in opposite directions in the books arya was heading where the hound had been emotionally and the hound was heading away from that darker place there was actually character development and a story taking place for sandor arya even started calling him sandor imagine that he has a namehe had gone from hate driving him to love driving him and that love was for someone arya once loved too but she hasnt come up yet for some reason even though he brought her up a dozen times in the books arya had lost those she loved and felt more and more like no one hate was driving her nowthere was a last glimmer of who she once was with the hound maybe hating wasnt the way maybe when you get to know someone things dont look so black and white anymore on to the house of black and white"

"The_Lone_Direwolf",2014-05-07,"i think that the hounds assessment that having armor and a sword is superior and that syrio must be dead isnt necessarily true and shows that he has certain assumptions about what it means to be a good fighterâ the hound assumes that a big sword and armor will always beat water dancing but being smarter and more agile thanâ your opponent playing the mental game can also be effectiveâ faceless men rely on stealth and smarts which i think is far more dangerous than a large sword as was shown by jaqen at harrenhallâ â â good call and this could also be the shows way of subtly leading us up to the prize fight of the season the mountain vs the red viper gregor is the living embodiment of the hounds assumptions which cant be a coincidence he was mentioned in their scene before this one and of course is his brother and as seen in the season previews we are going to get to see oberyns version of water dancing with his spear work oberyn in the books wears a light scaled armor i think but i bet in the show he will barely wear any edited by thelonedirewolf 07 may 2014  1019 am"

"Newstar",2014-05-07,"i wouldnt worry until and unless sandor is unambiguously killed off in the show and if he survives the season its a pretty safe bet hes being kept alive for something i think the writers were trying to do something with sansan even if they made a botch of it the riot scene and the deleted scene that should have gone into 2x03 suggested as much i think its more a matter of good intentions with a sloppy execution rather than a deliberate attempt to eliminate any hint of sansan again with the 2x03 scene with sansan they went so far as to shoot it and include it as a deleted scene on the dvd if they were deliberately trying to downplay it they wouldnt have done that although tyrion also wound up in that 2x03 scene though he wasnt in the equivalent scene in the books playing the benevolent intervener to sandors antagonist so i dunno with tv sandor i do feel like the writers didnt really feel comfortable writing for him until season 3 when they found their sea legs and had settled on the characterization that they wanted then the hounds storyline took off i think sansan suffered as a result but i dont think that was the intent also and i know mileage varies on this in my opinion mccanns acting did him no favours hes improved in season 4 but its too little too late where sansan interactions are concerned since for the published book material that window closed in season 2 i do think the tv version of the sansatyrion relationship was probably more palatable to the tv writers since it was easier to play it off as something purely platonic or even pseudoparental cant really do that with sandor long story short tv sansan was a bit of a shitshow in season 2 i agree but i think that the writers did try and that it just didnt work for a number of reasons i dont think that failure necessarily means anything significant for future events in the books though edited by newstar 07 may 2014  1109 am"

"Annara Snow",2014-05-07,"â i highly doubt arya listing the hound on her kill list as well as trying to poke him with needle hurt sandors feelings much he thinks shes an annoying little twat for the most part and a pain in his ass that hes only keeping around because he wants hostage gold for her skinny butt they do not have a very amiable relationship in the books or on the show either one and i was personally glad to see the audience reminded of that when he slapped her hard enough to make her mouth bleed i love arya to death dont get me wrong  shes probably one of my top three favorite stories  characters of all time in the books but shes got a long ways to go in learning her role and this scene played that up perfectly the hound is reminding her just how far shes got to go before she ever hopes to kill a man in a fight it reinforces her need to learn sneakier  assassin ways and gets us excited for her braavos journey â then why does he tell her about saving sansa and go on about how hes not such a bad guy in both book and show why is he trying to make her like him â â â yes i agree its brutal but then again she did just stab him  and that was no play stab he is on her list  and i think if it was anyone else but arya stark that person would be dead shortly after hitting the ground â i think one thing about their relationship is the hound sees himself when he sees her  seething cynical and hatefilled she may be highborn but is no respecter of social rank and neither is he one part of this similarity is that when arya judges him she judges him the way hed judge himself would he forgive someone like himself for mycah deep down no â i think this is why the hound feels some unspoken obligation to keep her around and even teach her a bit of the realworld if it was for truly mercenary reasons like the way bronn is hed have bound her up and delivered her to some freys for a quick reward â now thats much truer imo to how sandor really feels about arya â the show is getting it wrong by making it seem like sandor has to tell arya that the world is awful and you get nowhere by being honorable etc arya at least bookarya doesnt need to be told any of that shes already dark and nihilistic at an even younger age sansa is the one sandor sees as an innocent idealist as his former innocent childâ self who needs to be taught that the world is awful arya is the angry traumatized child that he became because of gregor and the way others let gregor get away with everything and made him a knight oddly enough maisie talked in interviews about arya being empty and dark this season â agree it was poorly filmed wasnt it michele maclaren who said before that she didnt get the hound funny since shes touted as the action director yes it seems they are using sandor to prop up arya he did seem fine staying in the village with her until they kicked him out there were calls of whitewashing the hound in season 2 and he was chivalric to sansa and then we get an even more angry gruff harsh hound with arya he baited her about mycah when he cried on the book he was going to kill the pig farmer on the show when he didnt for the reader he hits the man who takes him in and steals from him he smacks arya just like meryn did sansa right in the scene where they were talking about meryn im not sure i understand the change did they think he wasnt dangerous enough before they made the choices they did to him with sansa they gave littlefinger his story the changed grrms script with the song and used the you wont hurt me line from the deleted scene with them and therefore cut it from the aired episode â about not crying its symptomatic of the way that the show turns characters into the stereotypes they are subverting in the books and especially the way they treat gender on the show little girls cry a lot especially if theyre sansa but myrcella cries too and i think even arya cried in the scenes where they dont actually cry in the books but grown men never cry especially if theyre big and strong warriors even though sandor crying during his emotional meltdowns was so memorable and an integral part of his strongest scenes but the show would rather have typical badass antihero characters spouting comic oneliners thats also why they like bronn so much which apparently gets a great response than having to deal with such confusing things as 2 m tall huge scary warrior dudes being vulnerable and crying like a baby quote arya stark in the book because of the childhood trauma thats defined their entire life and personality and ladylike and apparently meek little girls who offer comfort to the huge scary warrior dude whos having an emotional meltdown and turning into a 6yer old boy abused by his big brother â maybe they cut all of the sansasandor references in the show because its obvious the show prefers dwelling with the sansatyrion scenario sansa already has left the capital and in most of her scenes from there she spoke nicely of tyrion â i hope the show doesnt go this extreme and instead of having sansa thinking about sandor in the vale she starts fantasizing about tyrionâ i hope you are right but my impression from the scenes you listed is that in the show only his feelings were well established and since when they departed from each other she doesnt even seem to remember he ever existed in addition all she talks about now isâ how a good person is tyrionâ im still feebly hoping it will not turn intoâ oh how i miss tyrionâ â thing is she only talked about tyrion in the scenes where she also talked about tyrion in the book because he came up in conversation for logical reasons  with lf when they talk about joffreys murder and with lysa when they talk about sansas marriage she has a more positive opinion of him in the show yes  they changed her mildly positive statementsmild defenses of tyrion from the book into stronger positive statements and stronger defenses of tyrion which is consistent with how tyrion has been portrayed in the show and how their relationship was portrayed in season 3  and which is also emblematic of the shows general attempts to portray tyrion as a total nice guy and to minimize conflicts between the good guy characters they want to make sure that everyone likes tyrion despite him having married a 14year old captive of his family against her will because they think the show needs an unambiguously likable protagonist and they also want people to like sansa now instead of bitching that shes not nice to their favorite character as so many do in the book fandom â however while theres a big difference in the degree of positivity the fact remains that booksansa at this point also talked about tyrion to lf and lysa just as much as showsansa did and also talked positively about him  she tells lysa that tyrion didnt consummate the marriage because he was kind and thats booktyrion who made her get naked groped her breast and made her see him naked and erect which she was quite traumatized by and only checks herself when she realizes that she cant say something like that to lysa because lysa hates tyrion so much so she quickly changes it to he had whores he told me which he did in the book unlike the show â  and the fact remains also that booksansa also never talks about sandor to anyone the difference is that we know sansas internal thoughts in the books the show sucks at conveying peoples internal thoughts or subtext ive resigned myself to the fact that got is not six feet under or the sopranos and there will be no dream scenes or fantasy scenes showing what the characters are feeling thats why it also seems like the stark kids almostâ never think about each other thats why theres barely any foreshadowing of rlj or well anything really they just have a previously on and drop a plot twist thats why jon is like  oh ghost i missed you  well you wouldnt have known that he missed ghost before this episode would you if the alternative is to have sansa talk about sandor all the time like they made sam talk about gilly after they left the crasters the first time because the subtext has to be either spelled out or ignored id much rather not have her mention him especially since it makes no sense in her case who would she talk about him to its not like lysa or lf or margaery were going to ask her about him nobody knows about their connection its one of the few secrets sansa has even from littlefinger and sandor is completely under the radar of littlefinger if sansa were careless and stupid enough to start talking about him now that would change the storyline considerably if sandor is to play a role in sansas story in the future the show may have unintentionally made lf stupider than he is in the books but even showlf would not be that stupid not to catch onto something like that if sansa was open about it hes trying to isolate her and convince her that everyone else is untrustworthy in the book he made sure to let her know through dontos that the tyrells dont care about her then he kills dontos and tells her that dontos was never her friend and was in it just for the money then he tells her tyrion is a monster who gave his first wife to his guards to rape when he got bored of her although its never clear if sansa actually believed the latterâ because lf wants her to think he is her only friend if sandor is to play some role in sansas story before lf loses her grip on her its probably important that lf does not have him on his radar â i seriously doubt it sophie said in a recent interview sansa doesnt love tyrion and on the recap said marrying him was the worst day in sansas life â there was also a video interview one of the interviews she was giving before season 4 premiered where she made a very strong ugh expressionbody language when asked about sansa being married to tyrion i cant find that video now ive seen lots of cast interviews at the time of the easom 4 premiere she may have been cagey about sansas storyline in some aspects like smiling and saying she cant say anything about whether sansa will be seen at a location other than kl but she never went so far to actually lie and feign sansaherself having a completely different feeling about something than it really is â if that were the case pod would end up with tyrion shae would end up with tyrion bronn would end up with tyrion even cersei would end up with tyrion before this season theyve painted scenes of each of these characters with him far nicer than in the books and them far nicer to him in return the whole show is a love story between tyrionwesteros when he goes to essos it will be tyrionessos watch out jorah you are about to lose your story too â dont forget margaery margaery will end up with tyrion more than anyone else remember how she talked about tyrions good looks and his skills in bed how would she even know that even robb may have ended up with tyrionâ  they didnt have robb and cat learn about sansas marriage on the show and express anger and disgust because they assumed tyrion was raping her and trying to get her pregnant to strengthen the lannister claim to winterfell and they didnt have robb say that sansa will be murdered by the lannisters as soon as she gives them an heir or that he will make sansa a widow by cutting tyrions head file that under the same minimize conflicts and bad thoughts between protagonists category as showdany never saying anything negative about ned stark and never using the term usurpers dogs  apparently the audience cant deal with the concept of sympathetic characters being in conflict with each other due to circumstances or because they dont know the whole story well theyre quite right in that regard ive seen so much bitching about dany for that reason among book fans because apparently shes a horrible person for having a bad opinion about a man shes never met and that shes only ever known about as one of the men who waged war against her family and were responsible for their demise in viserys heavily biased and whitewashed version of rr which nobody else she knows has cared to seriously challenge â i think its really tyrion whos lost his story more than anyone booktyrion is widely unpopular almost nobody likes him he has a horrible reputation the highborn find the idea of marrying their daughters to the imp an insult hes been dealing with that all his life and even when people dont hate him he thinks they do because hes used to thinking that everyone does as when he thinks that sansa hates him or that she would rather marry lancel hes very insecure needy and proud and has a bunch of issues showtyrion is just this good funny and cool guy who happens to be a dwarf but is genuinely liked or loved by lots of people highborn girls like margaery apparently think hes good marriage material he has a lover who really loves him as opposed to pretending to because shes paid for it  why would he have issues im really curious how the upcoming trial and tyrions dark turn is dealt with and what response it gets from the audience"
"Envie",2014-05-07,"â then why does he tell her about saving sansa and go on about how hes not such a bad guy in both book and show why is he trying to make her like him â i dont know  because thats how the show writers and many readers interpreted it theres certainly a lot you could potentially read into georges writing as hes often very subtle unlike the show he doesnt feel the need to bash people over the head with clues or pop them in the mouth but then again what he does give is pretty clear once youve read it a couple of times it took me a reread to really get a lot of what ive read and am now interpreting over to the television versionâ â while i do not think sandor is as evil as some watching the show may see him hes definitely one of the better gray characters of the book i also do not see him as someone with deep feelings for sansa or arya either one the sansan theorists would disagree passionately im sure a lot of those hints little bird singing etc were never expanded on and the last we saw of sandor he was laying under a tree dying theres just not a lot you can do with that now in watching the show yknow â i dont take anything i see in the show as a heavy hint anymore dd are making stuff up as they go along for quite a bit of the show the crasters keep arc is a good example and so im not going to speculate on sandors feelings based on him slapping arya on the show it just didnt happen and who knows what dd think his character should be or thinks  they are like us interpreting the books in their own way"
"Tixu Oty",2014-05-07," and the fact remains also that booksansa also never talks about sandor to anyone the difference is that we know sansas internal thoughts in the books the show sucks at conveying peoples internal thoughts or subtext ive resigned myself to the fact that got is not six feet under or the sopranos and there will be no dream scenes or fantasy scenes showing what the characters are feeling â snip â nobody knows about their connection â hmm its true that the show doesnt do subtext and is pretty straightforward which does eliminate a lot of possibilities but if sandor is relevant in sansas future storyline there could still be somewhat subtle ways to let us know hes on her mind they could have her drop a sneaky comment about true knights or judging books by their cover or i dont know what else to a random non dangerous confidant such as robin you know in the same way that arya made that comment in season 3 about knowing a man who could kill the hound with his little finger â and its one of the things i find absolutely fascinating about the hound and sansa is that they manage to have such a peculiar relationship in a castle full of people without anybody ever suspecting that these two could possibly have anything to say to each other so if it is to be relevant later on then yes i imagine it would be important to let us know sansa hasnt forgotten him quite the contrary dont they say absence makes the heart fonder or something to that effect and i believe it can be done in a reasonably subtle way let us hope"

"DogLover",2014-05-07,"so you dont like dark fantasy at all if you say you do then you are bullshitting dark story and dark fantasy is filled with racism blood gritty and horrifying with all hope for the good guys is extinguished whilst the bad guys live and the moral grey people like the hound is the people who live in dark fantasy look at the witcher and at game of thronesasioaf its like it is for a reason â what â just because i dont like the way the writers are characterizing the hound on the show has nothing to do with how i feel about dark fantasy the writers have taken an incredibly complex character who struggles with his moral compass and reduces him to a onedimensional brute while whitewashing arya who is far darker in the books the writers are also incredibly inconsistent with their storyline its all over the placemore like each of their scenes are individual skits rather than one continuous and cohesive storyâ â how is it that saying they reversed the characterization for the hound and arya on the show is not liking dark fantasy it was actually more interesting with the woman being the darker character arya and the hound were heading in opposite directions in the books arya was heading where the hound had been emotionally and the hound was heading away from that darker place there was actually character development and a story taking place for sandor arya even started calling him sandor imagine that he has a name he had gone from hate driving him to love driving him and that love was for someone arya once loved too but she hasnt come up yet for some reason even though he brought her up a dozen times in the books arya had lost those she loved and felt more and more like no one hate was driving her now there was a last glimmer of who she once was with the hound maybe hating wasnt the way maybe when you get to know someone things dont look so black and white anymore on to the house of black and white â â â so you dont think its possible doglover likes or has nothing against dark fantasy but actually dislikes bad dark fantasy â â not really bad dark fantasy usually fits your description formulaic and vulgarly simplistic morality tales are just bad even when the morality is turned upside down and good guys replace bad guys in the role of traditional losers thankfully asoiaf books are pretty far from that territory â exactly â"

"Envie",2014-05-08,"i think dd put the bit in there about syrio between arya and the hound just to work up fans on forums just like this one â theyre book fans too  they probably had a whole bucket list of minor characters they wanted to know what happened to while writing the show gendry coldhands patchface etc etc and from that bucket list they decided which characters would be important to cast each season and which ones would be dropped or never added because they did not advance the story in some important way â adding back in a line or two from arya about syrio doesnt mean hes still alive its just tying back in aryas water dancing routine so that when the hound laughs at her and knocks her on her butt the point is hit home shes no warrior with that fighting style and better find another way to survive and kill her hit list  which as we all know is coming with her decision to go to braavos television show only viewers have no idea what aryas going to do and thus they wrote in some material to help tie it all together in the near future"
"Pod The Impaler",2014-05-08,"its just tying back in aryas water dancing routine so that when the hound laughs at her and knocks her on her butt the point is hit home shes no warrior with that fighting style and better find another way to survive and kill her hit list â â to be fair the style a girl was demonstrating goes better with stabbing people where their armour is not â a girl has forgotten some of her lessons â edited by pod the impaler 08 may 2014  1257 pm"

"Jairion Lannister",2014-05-05,"id have preferred if they stuck to the book but i understand why they did it my guess is that they knew the only cat moment will already be massive itll be a big episode where tywin dies bran probably meets the three eyed crow and jon is elected as lc of the nw in that context along with lysas murder the reveal of jons death will seem fairly minor when it should be seen as important in this episode however which wont be seen as the biggest of the season by any means its a fairly big reveal which people will remember i imagine lysa will still mention the death in the final episode when shes about to be killed so sansa knows"

"Grody Brody",2014-05-05,"i am like 90 confident it will be in episode 7 â agreed its called mockingbird havent they cast someone as bronze yohn royce i reckon sansas storyline this season ends with littlefinger bargaining his way out of trouble with the vale lords remember that meeting where he had someone draw a sword i forget the details and the show laying it on even thicker with littlefinger being a creep who wants to bang sansa â which puts the show very close to the books dun dun dun maybe the controversial sansa scene thats supposed to be in twow will even turn up this season dun dun dunnnnn â i liked it i thought the reveal in the bookdone through a long villain expository monologue as clunky as anything youd find in the cheesiest james bond movieswas horribly executed this isnt a huge improvement but at least it gets that revelation out of the way so that the tension and the momentum in the moon door scene wont be deflated by lysa giving a long speech where she explains exactly at great length what her deal is ditto for the scene with sansa where lysa shows just how crazy and jealous she can be â disagree i think that moon door moment was the best i liked it better than the red wedding in fact because it was such a surprise and yet was telegraphed so subtly it tied up a few loose ends while completely upending everything we thought had happened magnificent and lysas speech worked very well i thought she was drunk she was crazy and she was madly in love with a man who didnt love her back she probably knows deep down that he doesnt love her and was constantly trying to do things to remain in his favour hence agreeing to murder her husband  something she probably felt deeply guilty about all of which adds up to her needing reassurance from him that she did the right thing and that he still loves her  pathetically trying to bargain for his love by reminding him of the things shes done for him and drunk and crazy enough to be reckless with it too â and littlefinger being a man who knows how to roll with the punches decided to deal with it there and then fuck what a brilliant moment â handled slightly mehly on the show but i guess nothings perfect and theyre worried the average viewer wont remember jon arryn plus this is the first time weve seen lysa since season 1 in the books it takes a few chapters for lysas craziness around sansa to come to a head but i guess theyre pressed for time and wanted to stick to the important bits well still see littlefinger cracking on to sansa and lysas jealousy growing to bursting point and then shes out the window in episode 7 â they also need to introduce some sort of marilliontype character to serve as a patsy and it would make for a heck of a busy episode if the marilliontype characters introduction the snow scene the confrontation and the moon door scene all took place in the same episode â well im sure they could work around that eg â  guards guards lady lysa just jumped out the moon door  guards guards lady lysa got drunk and fell out the moon door  guards guards a bloody big bird just swooped in and pecked lady lysa to death and then scooped her up in its claws and flew away and also it cleaned up all the blood look there it goes did you see it oh you must have just missed it ah well exhales that was fucking crazy eh whos lord now i guess its me â not disliking it explains why littlefinger is playing lysas game of marrying and loving her because she knows too much also is good to know that finally someone has lf grabbed by the balls it was obvious that he didnt like her to openly say i killed for you like she did â yeah its a shame we lost the surprise of it but then this shows always been much more up front about littlefingers importance and villainy and its mostly worked very well â the more i think about it however the more im convinced itll be stated again in the only cat moment not for the benefit of the viewers knowledgebut for sansas meaning get that shocking moment out of the way for us as viewersand then when only cat happens we can really focus in on sansas reaction to it rather than being shocked by it ugh i hope that made senseâ â if sansas knowledge of the truth of the arryn poisoning is important in and of itself  rather than her just being the vehicle for the audience discovering that knowledge  then that points the way towards her somehow taking advantage of that knowledge in the future does that make sense im saying in the books sansa finds out because we the reader have to find out and shes the only pov in the vale  but it doesnt mean that shell do anything with that knowledge on the show though theyre not sticking to the povs so they can give us that knowledge whenever  which they just did so if they make a big deal out of sansa specifically being the one to hear that knowledge that signals to me that her knowing that knowledge will have some kind of importanceprominence within the story â sorry for my appalling

"Haymaker",2014-05-05,"honestly this is a reveal that is not possible without clunky exposition however and whenever you do it it works and overcomes the unreality of it because its so shocking when you first find out and realize littlefinger has been playing the ultimate long game and is the man behind the curtain not because its actually a good scene in either the book or the show it obviously cant pack that same punch when you already know the truthâ â  thisâ â although surprised they decided to reveal it this early my wife a nonbook reader had that awesome shock reaction of sitting up to the edge of the couch and proclaiming wait whaaaat holy shit littlefinger was behind it allâ so i was satisfied with the scene â"

"Andurz",2014-05-07,"as a long time book reader im a little embarrassed to admit that id honestly forgotten that lf was behind john aryns death and as such was just as shocked as my unsullied so when watching this scene â id thought theyd pulled another potential future book spoiler on us like last week but obviously after a quick refresher this was obviously not the case â â â my point though is that i was still stoked to see the only cat scene in the show and had been exited to see how it would playout in the show ever since we realized we were getting a floor based moon door even without the john aryn reveal â the scene just has enough impact and shock value that it works without it and can fully understand why the show runners would split it up as a way of more evenly distributing important plot details â"

"Colonel Green",2014-05-08,"why the timing of sansas realisation and reaction is so critical that they couldnt possibly jeopardise it yeah for a number of reasonsâ chief among them that its occurring in the chaotic moments where lysa dies is kind of important for why littlefinger is able to convince her that lysa was just going nutsâ it would also completely change her attitude at the eyrie in the leadup to the finale when she isnt supposed to know that theres anything especially off about her aunt or littlefinger theyve changed the former slightly by making her jealousy obvious but thats not remotely the same thing as her knowing they conspired to murder jon arryn and start a war leading to the deaths of sansas family"

you havent answered my question â â so i gather you dont like tyrionâ â i could list lots of sansarelated reasons why i find this endgame unlikely  such as why i dont think that sansas arc so far points or hints to an outcome in which she end up prostitutingsacrificing herself for winterfell or that even if she were to end that way there are lots of other people she could prostitute herself to for much better political gains compared to what marrying a lannister could get her but what particularly strikes me about your doom scenario is that it is contingent on tyrion ultimately playing the role of a immoral villaintwisted monstersexually deviant demon monkey much like the richard iiilike version of him from phario forels play or the popular image of him among people of westeros now booktyrion is not saint tyrion of the show hes a very flawed man but hes definitely not twisted demon monkey tyrion even though this version seems popular among a portion of book fans on this forum as with dany who must be evil mad queen if shes not the perfect messiah of goodness characters apparently must be black of white grrm is subverting the twisted monster trope with tyrion and with other characters  even when tyrion as a part of his descent into darkness in adwd starts thinking of himself and behaving similarly to what people always thought he was im pretty sure were not supposed to think they were right he is and was always an evil monster and well i also dont think that an ending based on making the readers ponder look at how awful disgusting and vomitinducing those men with dwarfism are would be any more enlightened than your sarcastic scenario about beautiful girls having to prostitute themselves and fat women being the worst â really weve been there with sansa and tyrion not done that seen that scenario subverted in multiple ways i dont see it being repeated and played straight the second time in either one of those ways twisted demon monkey raping and abusing the beautiful tragic maiden or spoiled girl seeing the light and realizing that her forced marriage was what she always needed because her husband is just so awesome and girls dont know whats good for them in the first place â i will concede though that i dont think its out of the question that sansa and tyrion may due to circumstances always remain married officially i just dont think theyll ever going to have sex or actually live like husband and wife the ring may always stay there but therell be no bloody cloak so to speakâ i wouldnt be too surprised if just like in the game we love to play in the games forum the people sansa gets to fuck marry and kill are all separate from each otherâ i think that grrm hinted in an interview that the death of sansas direwolf mean that she was no longer of the northdied as a stark so i dont think book sansa will ever go north again given that even in the best case scenario the starks will need to be rebuilding winterfell after ados they will certainly need sansa to make a goodwealthy marriage since arya certainly wont be available since harry the heir and willas tyrell have yet to be seen on screen it doesnt seem likely that sansa will end up with either of those nonentities whereas tyrion has been around from book 1 i â think future books will show sansa as haunted by grief over her betrayal of her father as a result of her minuscule book 1 actions and she will make the decide to stay with tyrion as a form of repentance so i dont think tyrion will force her to remain married he maybe a rapist and a whore monger but he likes the fantasy of being desired but she will offer for reasons that are both rational and moral ie not motivated by twu wuv but motivated by self sacrifice in exchange for lannister gold to rebuild winterfell tyrion will thus finally believe that he has obtained his fantasy possession of a beautiful woman who will love him for himself only for it to be the the same relationship he had with shae but with a much higher priceâ sex without desire is at the very least nauseating as any woman who has tried it can attest and desire is ultimately about the body the judgements of the body are not enlightened ones perhaps dd just dont get that a woman can make unemotional but moral decisions so they will have the completion of the tyrion sansa marriage be about twu wuv and arent i lucky to have such a nice and funny guy â i once shared your optimism about tyrion and sansa but the show made me realise that it wasnt end game my suspicions were raised as far back as season 2 when they eliminated sansan and tyrions comment along the lines of youll surprise us yet lady stark but season 3 confirmed it the shows lack of subtly kind of made the ending of the book easier to predict â â â

about the body the judgements of the body are not enlightened ones perhaps dd just dont get that a woman can make unemotional but moral decisions so they will have the completion of the tyrion sansa marriage be about twu wuv and arent i lucky to have such a nice and funny guy â i once shared your optimism about tyrion and sansa but the show made me realise that it wasnt end game my suspicions were raised as far back as season 2 when they eliminated sansan and tyrions comment along the lines of youll surprise us yet lady stark but season 3 confirmed it the shows lack of subtly kind of made the ending of the book easier to predict â â but they did not eliminate sansanâ they just downplayed it for various reasons including not being very good at writing it and being awful to showing subtext but they didnt eliminate it  and they could have if that was the idea in that case there would have been no need for emphasizing little moments between them making a big deal of him rescuing her and expanding it compared to how it was in the show and adding lines like i didnt do it for you including that entire scene during the blackwater which would be pretty pointless if the two arent supposed to have any kind of important dynamic or making sandor outright imply that he would kill joffrey to save sansa which he never does in the books but does in the show you will be grateful one day for the hateful things i do when im all that stands between you and your beloved king the deleted scene from season 2 shows one of the reasons why it may be good that dd they downplayed it in their own episodes namely they quite suck at writing it its extremely challenging considering 1 that dd seem unable to include the true knight theme from the books it happens in briennes story too 2 i imagine they were quite insecure about potential romantic overtones between a grown man and a teenage girl on screen and whetherto which extenthow not to make sandor look like a creep since hes not supposed to be a villain like lf 3 they really really suck at conveying subtext and internal thoughts so when characters arent talking about someone or interacting with someone they seem to forget about that person see jon and arya apparently not thinking about each other the stark kids in general when it comes to each other and while that would not be a problem with sandor who has arya to talk to however see point 2 it is with sansa if the lack of subtextforeshadowing in this show is a proof that something has been eliminatedis unimportant for the future story there is a much stronger case to argue that jons parentage will be unimportant for the storys resolution on the show and we know that this is definitely not true from dds story about their first meeting with grrm â in any case the idea that they have eliminated sansan can be easily disproved by the fact that so many unsullied fans and reviewers picked up on something and that it was shipped quite a bit and the interviewers who talked to grrm in this interview even believed that the shows have stoked these fires of sansan shipping â so you seem to mostly basing your theory on two things that arent actually true as for the rest i have seen no textual evidence that sansa would start to be overcome with remorse for the supposed role in neds death and one would think that if sheâ felt that way that wouldve come up much before say in book 1 or 2  again its another piece of popular fanonsomething that people like to say on the forum but that hasnt reallyâ been a part of the books nor do i see any other signs that this selfsacrificial marriageprostitution future is where sansas arc is heading if anything it seems to be going the opposite way with the way sansas views on marriage and sex have developed and the kind of people shes been interacting with and influenced by lately in the books including mya and myranda nor would sansas training under lf have any point if all her game playing is about being a good wifeprostitute for tyrion she should have been learning from bookshae in that case â i also dont see any evidence of this supposed tyrionsansa endgame on the show its not like theyve made them romantically interested in each other and theres nothing there that isnt easily explained by the wish to keep tyrion as an unambiguous good guy despite being the husband of a 14year old girlâ forced into marriage by her captors and to keep both tyrion and sansa likable to the audience whose capability for complex moral situations dd really dont tend to overestimate to put it mildly its not like there was a way to eliminate the sansatyrion forced marriage as a plot point ive seen lots of people comment on the you may still survive us line as a possible piece of foreshadowing of sansa surviving the series but i dont think ive ever seen anyone else consider it foreshadowing of a sansatyrion endgame not do i see why it would be if anything wouldnt it imply that tyrion dies before sansa and an ability to survive captivity doesnt imply selfsacrice does it and if tyrion being nicer to sansa and tyrion and sansa being friendlier to each other is a unsubtle signconfirmation of tyrion and sansa ending up together you could just as well take the fact that tyrion is much nicer to podrick and that they have a stronger relationship as evidence of tyrion and podrick hooking up in the end â it seems like you just came up with that theory and then saw supposed evidence for it everywhere edited by annara snow 05 may 2014  0153 pm"

chemistry on the show with â im amused that you think that rory has so much clout that dd would change a major storyline just to accommodate rorys unease especially with how many of his scenes and lines they cut i suppose if he was charles dance or sean bean it may be a bit more believable but still unlikely since actors dont get to decide what happens on the show â and rory is more or less being in a laughinggood mood every time he goes on about sophie being a lass and him drinking with her parents doesnt seem like the guy whos storming into the offices to ask less scenes with sophie damn it surely if he was storming into the offices to ask something he wouldve been asking for more screentime and lines the the last time he was asked about sansan at a convention he said that it could happen maybe in the end but he just doesnt want to think about it because of the whole drinking with her parents thing â â â ive actually seen more shipping of sansa with margaery from unsullied viewers than sansan i see a lot of sansaxtyrion and even sansaxlf for that matter â â sansa and margaery had lots of screentime together and shipping two goodlooking women is generally a popular thing to do in fandoms in the buffy fandom buffyfaith was almost just as popular as buffys canon pairings with angel and spike  who wereare very popular themselves andâ had lots and lots of development screentime and chemistry im not sure how the fact that a lot of unsullied ship them proves that sansan has been eliminated downplayed yes eliminated  no  if it had been why would the unsullied reviewers and fans be shipping them or noticing their connection in the first place especially if the actors really have that little chemistry as youre saying and its not a case of two people being canonically married tyrionsansa or the show telegraphing the villains creepy sexual interest as much as possible lfsansa so people were left to just wonder what is this or think that theres no relationship between them at all â sansa and lf  lots of screentime lf is obviously creeping on her interested in her in that way sansa and tyrion also lots of screentime tyrion is the most popular character on the show some people will see any marriage as a big deal no matter what someone was just arguing in another thread that tyrion and sansa will end up together in books andâ show because marriage is a sacred vow and the hs would not allow it annulled and most of all it manages to touch all those nice guy â<U+0099> buttons that are so widespread in fandoms including this one you can see it a lot in the book fandom too almost as much as danyjorah i can only imagine the danyquentyn response if he is cast on the show â and if you blame rorys unease about romancing someone sophies age on the show for downplaying their connection though i dont know why that would be the case so many of their interactions have little or nothing explicitly romantic including the famous scene where he tells her about his scars are you saying that peter dinklage or aidan gillen or natalie dormer have told the producers that they would be totally down with some love scenes between them and sophie otherwise i dont see the significance of rorys comments for that matter i dont remember that peter ever being asked about a possible tyrionsansa romance so he may say something similar to rory for all you know although he was once asked about the love triangle and he corrected the interviewer by saying that its not a love triangle since that would imply love on all sides just a pickle and aidan gillen is totally trolling the readers and talking in interviews about lfs avuncular and fatherly feelings for sansa and insisting that theyre totally not creepy â  maybe its time to ask what exactly do you mean by sansan do you mean some explicit romantic stuff or just relationship in general sure theres been nothing explicitly romantic between them but its not like there was that much of it in the books either while they were around each other and a lot of the unsullied still saw their relationship in those terms unlike say sandorarya where people are fortunately clear on it really not

"greensleeves",2014-05-05,"does she have chemistry with aidan gillen or peter dinklage the other adult men with whom she has several interactions though if she doesnt have chemistry with any of them rory mccanns relative lack of it with sophie turner would hardly seem to matter its kind of weird to talk about chemistry in this context given the crazy age difference unless you mean in a purely actoractor sense like rory mccanns great rapport with maisie williams which just pops off the screen and thats kind of an unfair comparison maisie williams seems to have chemistry with all of her costars again in a pure actoractor sense tywin syrio thoros etc etc in comparison sophie turner doesnt seem to be one of those chemistry with a wooden door actors or actresses who bounce well off everyone else that doesnt mean shes a bad actress but it does mean that she needs the right actorsactresses with whom she can establish a great connection â â i actually thought rory mccanns acting was pretty bad in the first three seasons including his scenes with maise williams â hes really improved this season imo anyways â it might have had something to do with the prosthetic he has to wear i know some of the behind the scenes stuff mentions that its ridiculously uncomfortable â â really on the contrary i thought they had lots of chemistry in the few scenes they had together considering how little substantial dialogue there was its one of the things that saved some of the scenes that barely had any dialogue in the sense that you could feel something some kind of a strange tension there but people often seem to have different ideas of what constitutes chemistry they arent going to start exchanging jokes and witticisms obviously â im curious who do you think sophie has chemistry on the show with â i think sophie turner is a very talented actress and that shes only gotten more talented as the show goes on â her scenes with almost all of the actors work wonderfully well â in her scenes with baelish for example i really get a whole obsessiveuncomfortablebutdesperate vibe â in the books i do get the vibe from sandors scenes with sansa that he has some complicated feelings about her â in the show meh â i guess its just a matter of opinion though â im amused that you think that rory has so much clout that dd would change a major storyline just to accommodate rorys unease especially with how many of his scenes and lines they cut i suppose if he was charles dance or sean bean it may be a bit more believable but still unlikely since actors dont get to decide what happens on the show they are pretty much forced to accommodate to the product he gives them hence the cut scenes and lines you mention â its hard to tell how much of the cutting was due to them just really not liking what they were getting and being forced to cut something they wanted vs not putting the effort in because that aspect of the story was unimportant to them â â sansa and margaery had lots of screentime together and shipping two goodlooking women is generally a popular thing to do in fandoms in the buffy fandom buffyfaith was almost just as popular as buffys canon pairings with angel and spike  who wereare very popular themselves andâ had lots and lots of development screentime and chemistry im not sure how the fact that a lot of unsullied ship them proves that sansan has been eliminated downplayed yes eliminated  no  if it had been why would the unsullied reviewers and fans be shipping them or noticing their connection in the first place especially if the actors really have that little chemistry as youre saying and its not a case of two people being canonically married tyrionsansa or the show telegraphing the villains creepy sexual interest as much as possible lfsansa so people were left to just wonder what is this or think that theres no relationship between them at all you have a very different picture of fandom than i do â femslash always seems to be the bastard child of fandom â male slash usually just called slash it needs no distinguishment gets amplified â my memory is getting rusty but i seem to recall a lot of angelspike fan activity â i dont recall much buffyfaith at all â â and if you blame rorys unease about romancing someone sophies age on the show for downplaying their connection though i dont know why that would be the case so many of their interactions have little or nothing explicitly romantic including the famous scene where he tells her about his scars are you saying that peter dinklage or aidan gillen or natalie dormer have told the producers that they would be totally down with some love scenes between them and sophie otherwise i dont see the significance of rorys comments for that matter i dont remember that peter ever being asked about a possible tyrionsansa romance so he may say something similar to rory for all you know although he was once asked about the love triangle and he corrected the interviewer by saying that its not a love triangle since that would imply love on all sides just a pickle and aidan gillen is totally trolling the readers and talking in interviews about lfs avuncular and fatherly feelings for sansa and insisting that theyre totally not creepy i obviously dont know what was going on behind the scenes but i do think that if the show was trying to include a romantic aspect to the sandorsansa relationship they would have emphasized that with rory â his comments to me suggest that either no such emphasis took place or he chose to reject that advice or maybe a mix â i understand

queen in the original version of snow white â what youre referring to is medieval chivalric romance which as written by and for aristocracy which introduced the concept of courtly love and is responsible for the ideas about knights and chivalry we have today they normally have happy endings yes  but thats not always the case tristan and iseult is a romantic tragedy in all its versions and some of the most famous stories such as those derived from the legends of king arthur and the knights of the round table are pretty damn dark and dont exactly have the happiest of endings arthur lancelot and guinevere dont exactly have happy fates â anyway i dont see how brienne would be less of a true knight if she fails in her quest success or failure is not what defines it the concept of true knight refers to the ideals and morality not that you can know what brienne will or will not succeed doing you cant know if shell be a complete failure unless you have a crystal ball you seem very convinced that in grrms work idealism and ethical behavior always lead to failure while ruthlessness and immorality lead to success well im afraid that the fates of tywin lannister the bloody mummers and gregor clegane currently a reanimated corpse and most his men as well as the current predicament of the house frey prove that youre wrong about the latter now its theoretically possible that littlefinger roose and ramsey will end the series triumphant  i admit that i dont have a crystal ball but i am willing to bet that they wont â true and i guess the anti war position and the deconstruction of conventional ideas about the possibility of heroic warfare is the strongest message martin wishes to transport to us readers there is no morally right no good way to lead a war may it be tywins or robbs war these are the experiences of the generation when martin was socialized politically there is no right life in the wrong one adorno there is no room for true heroes to keep their hands clean as long as they use the conventional means of warfare violence and ruling we see it in danys arc we saw robb the young hero commit crimes of war and any other potential hero leading armies may it be jaime tyrion or jon will have dirty hands in the end will load himself with guilt and death or fail and martin made a point in showing us  like hbo btw  that those who do the right thing at times like eg sandor or jaime have done the most atrocious crimes before and may continue to do so â â really im afraid that contemporary international laws disagree with you we have such things as the geneva convention which are based on the idea that there is a right and a wrong way to lead a war and no all is not fair in war that things like rape torture killing civilians killing prisoners of war genocide are war crimes and those who commit them shall be punished and that its not something you can just wave away with oh well war is awful people will do awful things in war what can you do everyone is bad so no one is bad lets just not punish war crimes at all because war in itself is a crime â asoaif does not represent that kind of moral relativism either grrm writes a number of grey characters but he also makes sure to write characters who are reprehensibly evil and shown to commit disgusting and horrible crimes who the audience is clearly supposed to hate gregor clegane exists in his writing alongside duncan the tall vargo hoat chyswick raff the tickler polliver rorge and biter exist alongside brienne youre telling me that there is no difference between grrm wrote robb stark or for that matter stannis as a military commander and how he wrote tywin lannister im not a fan of stannis but he and robb both prove that its possible for a commander to impose strict rules on their army and punish things like rape or murder of children prisoners and even if some of robbs forces commit awful crimes thats quite different from tywin who orders and encourages rape and murder of innocents as a war tactic â as for grrms views of war youve both ignored the part where he says that he wasnt against war in general he was against that one specific war the vietnam war and that he would have fought in the second world war â in 1966 you entered northwestern in evanston illinois i know that in the years that followed you underwent some serious moral and political changes due to your opposition to the vietnam war i was like many kids of my generation a hawk i accepted that america was the good guys we had to be there when i got into college the more i learned about our involvement in vietnam the more it seemed wrong to me of course the draft was happening and i decided to ask for the conscientiousobjector status i wasnt a complete pacifist i couldnt claim to be that i was what they called an objector to a particular war i would have been glad to fight in world war ii but vietnam was the only war on the menu so i applied for conscientiousobjector status in full belief that i would be rejected and that i would have a further decision to make army jail or canada i dont know what i wouldve done those were desperately hard decisions and every kid had to make them for himself to my surprise they gave me the status i was later told â<U+0080><U+0093> i have no way to prove this â<U+0080><U+0093> that i was granted the status because our conservative draft board felt that anyone who applied for co status should be granted it because that would be punishment enough then it would be part of their permanent record and everybody would know that they were a commie sympathizer and it would ruin their lives â httpmrollingston20140423page2 â so no grrm was against the vietnam war which usa had no business leading quite right but does not appear to think that peace is always better than war even when the war is about defeating an evil such nationalsocialism and fascism i dont think that he thinks that peace should be held at any costs even if it means allowing oppression abuse torture slavery and genocide he certainly doesnt seem to think it would have been better if every country tried to make peace with the nazi germany and if europe had

tywin orders chevauchae and we get a first hand impression of what it entails and the kind of people who carry it out robb orders the same but we need to fill in the blanks we do have mentions of northern forces sacking and raping we dont have a name for those criminals â â â â yes it is but that doesnt mean that someone whose goal is to rescue her has to be a failure contrary to the popular trope of lone hero its far more likely that people are going to succeed when they have help and collaborative efforts are more likely to succeed arya for instance could have died many times over in the firstâ books if she hadnt had help from various people from syrio to yoren to jaqen to sandor yet i dont see anyone criticizing her for that out of an idea that she has to save herself all on her own with no help from anyone in order to be worthwhile â well sansa will have to get allies part of her narrative in the coming books should revolve about that but her arc seems to be going in the direction of political allies instead of the very different knight coming to rescue her while she remains passive and is passively taken to safety so she can knit a fancy cloth for her rescuer and brienne simply doesnt fit the role of a political ally â yes war is bad duh thats not exactly a fresh new idea you know but there are still rules and ethics of conduct during war does everyone who breaks them get indicted and convicted for war crimes of course not do you think that everyone who commits crimes in peace gets brought to trial convicted and sentenced do you think that maybe just maybe powerful and rich people have better of getting away with their crimes but does that mean that there should be no law and everyone should just be allowed to do what they want hey since we cant punish everyone lets just let everyone go â ive seen the but war crimes just happen during the war and not everyone who did it will be brought to trial argument irl more times than i care to remember and irl its always a part of an attempt to argue that no war crimes trials should be held at all yet oddly enough nobody ever tries to argue that there should be no courts trials or jails in general since it will never be possible to try and convict every criminal in the world and some will always get away â regarding the westerosi military commanders i never said any of them were perfect but there is a clear difference between having some douche in your service whats clayton suggs done anyway and a systematic policy of rape and murder of civilians through employing men who are clearly there just for that purpose the mountain and his men the bloody mummers â â â did i say anything remotely like the bolded part no i didnt as for clayton suggs he has been stannis torturer for years which means he tortured people in dragonstone dungeons even during peacetime conveniently grrm leaves out the details â id like to add that robb forbade roose bolton to flay their prisoners just like ned did so hes not the kind of commander who indulges in cruelty thats the show i dont think there is any moment in the books in which robb makes any ruling regarding torture rape or murder"
"voodooqueen126",2014-05-11,"i understand that arguing about the justification of vietnam is is offtopic nonetheless i need to point out that two million vietnamese died in the war and that the usa was supporting an unpopular dictatorship there i am not denying that the vietnam war was unjustified but just pointing out that preventing the spread of communism is not an unworthy cause or atleast not a petty emotional one â and while we can say that go to war and kill thousands because your father was imprisoned isnt a good justification a modern hypothetical example would be the arrest of an american high official or former president outside the usa for crimes of waragainst mankindplain murder followed by an american military intervention in the country imprisoning him and tbh the far fetched part of this hypothetical is any country trying to make the arrest â oddly i have roughly argued the same thing to lf defenderstrolls that if an american president or british prime minister was judicially murdered by another head of government whilst visiting a foreign country there would probably be a war hopefully not as disastrous as ww1â â the thing is that as you say grrm conveniently leaves out the exact description of robbs crimes we do know tywin orders chevauchae and we get a first hand impression of what it entails and the kind of people who carry it out robb orders the same but we need to fill in the blanks we do have mentions of northern forces sacking and raping we dont have a name for those criminals â â â well sansa will have to get allies part of her narrative in the coming books should revolve about that but her arc seems to be going in the direction of political allies instead of the very different knight coming to rescue her while she remains passive and is passively taken to safety so she can knit a fancy cloth for her rescuer and brienne simply doesnt fit the role of a political ally well i agree that sansas arc unless the show really does want to make sansa remain a damsel in distress as i fear is about gaining political allies but i am sure whenif brienne eventually rocks up she will serve some sort of purpose otherwise why subjugate us to that trek around the crownlands â did i say anything remotely like the bolded part no i didnt as for clayton suggs he has been stannis torturer for years which means he tortured people in dragonstone dungeons even during peacetime conveniently grrm leaves out the details â thats the show i dont think there is any moment in the books in which robb makes any ruling regarding torture rape or murder well do you think it is significant that grrm elides over robbs possible war crimes such a modern notion or the fact that stannis employed clayton suggs for years whilst emphasising tywins numerous crimes"

other side of the wall use the time to mark how much he misses him 3 why changing the time frame the way it is written provides ample material battle villages in danger and the need to pull back villagers even some thorne vs john more politics dialogue with aemon sam and other researchâ 4 well jons arc is beautiful in the back without that knowledge we can imagine many stories and arcs where he doesnt need to know 5 this one is funny as they didnt even have to poke at feminist the way they did in the first placeand after all the whoring and raping that has been done in the first seaon i think they dont give a damn about feminists 6 stick to the original will have done the same make it a figth over what should be done with the villagers south of the wall and an opposition between thorne and jon make it about the cleverness of the preparation of the battle to come against the thens about the obligation of training even the builders an stewards make it about and young and rebelious jon vs a hatefull and straigthforward thorne make it about jon redeeming himself from his oathbreaking and put his efforts to the ground with a pompous arrival of janos slynt 7 they just managed the contrary as you state it very well for meera even jojen is diminished but for his moment against the mutineers where he is the true guide not just a simple reminder of brans own vision 8 jojen abilities in bran arc should have been enougth 9 iam ok with introducing locke for this purpose but create a full sum zero arc  surely there was another way â for this arc to exist they had to propose a scenario where jon think of aâ very stupid reason to go north of the wall motivated by a major info he doesnt have compared to the book which allisters agrees to when they obviously lack the men to handle the wildlings coming and let him have enougth men where is plan is to get him killed they made an impropable scenario of a chained ghost a trap for summer and bran meera jojen captured when they have a greenseer with them at the exact same time of the attack of jon on the mutineers â even if they needed what you have listed and there are some very valid points just ike the jonbolton tension they botched it in my opinion it is not about the changes or the additionnal arc is it about how he is brougth to the screen the plots that motivate it its realism the lack of emotions of jon knowing about bran info which is brougth off screen the absence of gost in any interaction of jon at the wall he could have mentionned it to sam that he missed him no â since joffrey death nothing happens really much in kings landing but we get to see new interactions and dialogues even a bit twisted and it is interesting and funny i think that the same could have been done at the wall and if you need some action for bran gods they are wildlings undead others there even some rogue nw surely there was something else to do rigth if you felt compelled to add some action but why adding some action at all yes his trip is boring but kind of peotic also to watch him going to his doom in this oppressive and dangerous north then youll tell me that it doesnt work on screen tell peter jackson who has to screen the whole frodon trip which is one of the most boring until they arrive in mordor"

"Darryk",2014-05-06,"agree with all the reasons given â on a character and story development level it strengthened jons leadership position fleshed out bran and jojens relationship and showed brans strengthening resolve â on an entertainment level we got a great performance form burn gorman a cool swordfighting sequence and hodor breaking a guys neck â and it brought jon and ghost back together which is always a good thing â also since grrm keeps going on about how the show runners sometimes kill off characters who arent dead in the books it was the first time in awhile that ive genuinely feared for characters wasnt entirely sure meera was going to survive the captivity i knew they wouldnt kill off any of the others yet"

"ToTheWolves",2014-05-06,"i know there is a thread already on crasters as filler but i wanted to tie it into some bigger threads that are not covered there and probably would be lost in the 7 pages of post already there as its degenerated currently into the efficacy of valyrian steel against bone â at first glance the crasters keep arc feels like filler â it feels like bad writing something glommed together perhaps to tug on heartstrings with another stark fauxreunion â but bear in mind that there are a number of other things omitted from the books that have had readers feeling that there will be problems in the future â i wanted to write out a list of some of the things that are addressed with this arc and what was expended to take care of them here and how fine of a job the writers managed to do in order to clean it up as neatly as it was done â in no particular orderexplore the great white north spoiler â the show writers want to remind the viewers that the othersbeyondthewall are an important and major threat there is much more exposition in the book about them and the format itself means that they are very likely to be in the readers mind even when they are not mentioned for show viewers they were seen in the first episode next they are seen with crasters child in season 2 and closing off the season at the fist of the first men after that sam kills one in season 3 thats it viewers have much more reason to fear the wights than the others as other than killing the first disposable characters the viewers meet in the first episode they steal a baby and get killed by a fat coward as he is presented to viewers dont worry sams cool and nothing else as such the viewers need both to be reminded of their existence and be convinced of the severity of their threat using crasters last son provides this opportunity bring ghost back to jon spoiler ghost went missing in the first half of season 3 perhaps viewers largely forgot about him but they needed a way to bring him back to jon without having him randomly show up at the northern gate of castle black or scale the wall by himself delay wildling attack on the wall spoiler theyve moved around some of the occurrences surrounding the battle at the wall but both with stannis going to braavos and jons early return as well as his being judged by janos slynt and alliser thorne prior to the attack from the south most likely the battle itself will be condensed the attack from the front will coincide with the attack from the south and while the nights watch will defeat the thenns  tormund stannis will show up just in time to break the main wildling attack from the north to accomplish this there needed to be action in jon snows story that can at least be claimed to delay the attack as without the mutineers apparently mance cannot learn that the nights watch is weak i do not recall if in the show they mentioned mance coming to winterfell to see king robert in the flesh but if they havent i doubt they will because he obviously would have determined the state of the nights watchs strength at that point jons knowledge of brans survival spoiler they get to have sam both to be a loyal friend to jon rather than hold to vows and words this will lead more easily to a sexual relationship with gilly and his eventual rescue of her and child from moletown having jon get the catharsis of cleaning out crasters keep after it has been identified as the one possible location for bran to have stopped by that they might find him means that he can set that to rest for the moment or they could recycle it later and omit the hardhome ranging in favor of jon using his power as eventual lord commander to organize a ranging to rescue bran appease modern feminists spoiler theres been a lot of rape and removal of womens agency recently having a crasterwife save jon then them strike off on their own direction perhaps they could combine the elder crasterwife with mother mole if they do want to have hardhome happen later will do much to pay lipservice to feminism justify jons reputation with nights watch rank and file spoiler the viewers have ample reason to root for jon snow most of the nights watch would only know him as a bastard born of traitors stock who was resentful of his appointment as mormonts steward his preferential treatment in being able to range with qhorin halfhand and then joining the wildlings after killing the halfhand who was revered then he comes back full of arrows and pronounces his oathbreaking a successful return from the difficult sortie to crasters keep will justify his reputation in their eyes and undermine thornes position when it comes time to elect a new lord commander this is done quietly without much exploration of nights watch politics as the show has less time to devote to that increase the crannogmens importance without storytelling spoiler meera is severely undermined in this arc as viewers cannot take her seriously as a huntress she was surprised by the mutineers and the next episode they were slaughtered like drunken pigs so the tradeoff was to make them more mystic by showing jojenvision to the audience jojenvision becomes the necessary guide for bran meera however is presently superfluous she will prove essential in a few episodes but she has to climb back of the uselessness hole the writers put her into it is also very unlikely that the reeds will tell the story of the knight of the laughing tree but if they do it will be because they traded meeras worldly knowhow for making her a keeper of lore direct bran north in a very specific way without coldhands spoiler jojenvision shows them the way north which will be expedited and finish by the end of the season sans coldhands incidentally it alludes to jojens potential death when bran gets north set up a causus belli for the boltons against jon snow without farya spoiler the bastard of bolton has less exploration in the show than in the books despite being explored earlier and it looks like the winterfell marriage arc is unlikely to happen as written  they can dodge the necessity of it by setting up a conflict between the boltons and jon snow how will roose react when locke does not return and jon snow becomes lord commander of the nights watch he will clearly view him as an enemy even prior to or without the conflicts in the book when hes mucking about in northern affairs by supporting stannis and playing matchmakerking in the north by interfering with the karstark family something that legally is the responsibility and privilege of the warden of the north roose bolton clean itself up spoiler mutineers were introduced and removed locke was continued and removed with the literal burning of the keep the extra elements added in are cleaned up while the story has been springboarded along its hard to say for certain if it was worthwhile but theres absolutely an argument to be made for the expediency of storytelling and it provided more flexibility than shows up at first blush in terms of future events for the series 6 was waiting for that to be brought up"

"Frey Pies",2014-05-08,"in my opinion the greatest benefit of adding it was that it was extremely entertaining all your points are valid of course except maybe the feminist one and things ive argued about with countless book readers over the internet but that is the most important reason â jon would literally have had nothing to do till episode 9 and bran as usual would just keep trudging through the woods this provided a nice change in pace for both and in my opinion is one of the best sequences of the entire show ive said this many times on the site but the jojen vision sequence ending with youll know is my favourite scene in the series thus far â all that matters is that i was more entertained with tv than ive been in a long time this season has been killing it and i loved that scene"
"tsarrast",2014-05-08,"lots of good points made here â i think its important to remember that the show will deviate from the books  and its necessary to do so for many reasons already listed in this thread 1 keeping the main actors involved 2 more efficiently telling the story  are probably the two primary ones that fuel changes â i think a lot of the changes that are made are fine and make for entertaining television as well as a more compact story that works â in fact the 1 thing i didnt like from this season was the jamie rape  which came not as much from changing the original story but just from bad direction or writing of the scene â that scene should have been more obviously consensual as it needlessly and violently ruined jamies character arc  to the point that im personally just replacing what happened in the show with what happened in the books in order to not be constantly frustrated â but otherwise i see a lot of merit behind the shows changes it was an entertaining way to have a lot more screen time with branjon and accomplish a lot of important points already listed â it also reset things now to being more similar to the books bran still going north without contact with jon  which btw i knew was going to happen somehow in that scene  direwolves returned to owners  showonly characters killed â at this point its clear the show is not a direct exposition of the books  nor do i believe it should be â accept the changes and take the show for what it is  very well done television that is being reasonably faithful to the books all things considered"
"Roxane De",2014-05-08,"â â 5 appease modern feminists â â hahaha indeed it felt right to have a bit of agency given to those helpless women those two last episodes were really difficult to watch because of the sexual violence i also liked what cercei said they hurt little girls everywhere its food for thoughts maybe for people who think that the violence is acceptable because its just a fiction although it happens in the real world at this very moment too"

"PatrickStormborn",2014-05-06,"anâ unsullied colleague was shocked and bummed out that daenarys wasnt getting on those 96 ships like immediately heading straight to westeros â aaah those unsullied and their naive ways â it was a very strange deviation for the show to make in the books dany has no ships at this point which is one of the main reasons she kind of has to stay in meereen if she marches she risks losing a large number of her people which just isnt feasible when she only has 10000 soldiers particularly as the 2000 sellswords she has would deteriorate rapidly on an unpaid march down the demon road â maybe the showrunners thought people would be more interested in danys reign of meereen if she has the power to leave whenever she wants her powerlessness is frustrating in the books but its mostly to set up the arrival of the ironborn and tyrion and danys eventual taming of drogon and reunion with the dothraki having 93 ships seriously undermines those plot developments and completely rejects the possibility of a siege of meereen which was already in danger after her season 2 storyline saw the deaths of all the members of the qartheen government"

"Envie",2014-05-06,"yeah for whatever reason they decided cutting coldhands out of the story and adding locke  karl and the additional crasters scenes would be better television material than a mysterious dead guy with black hands who leads everyone to bloodraven riding on an elk â i had always hoped we would find out who coldhands really was from the books as well im doing a reread of adwd now and its occurred to me in this second read of the chapters with him in it that one of the theories ive read here on the forums might have merit its entirely possible he was just some dead corpse  wight that bloodraven was warged into as a way to contact and help bran get to him is really possible if thats true though wouldnt it still have been important enough character development for the powers of bloodraven to have him appear on the show â my best guess is they decided it would be too tricky to show onscreen well and if the character has no future use in the books because its just a wight controlled by br then there was no need to film him at all"

"voodooqueen126",2014-05-08,"â i wouldnt be surprised if the show becomes increasingly unhinged from the books â not only are the shows departures from the books increasingly major but the producers dont seem to be concerned about the virtually 100 certainty that the show will hit its allotted 7 seasons before the 7th book is finished â remember grrm is a tv guy  he knows all about the way you change written material to fit it into a tv show â ill bet he has in mind an alternate ending that would work for tv and that wont spoil the book ending at all â thats my prediction anyway â even if im wrong about that though just because x happens in the show doesnt mean y wont happen in the books â i definitely wouldnt rule out coldhands playing a major role in the books just because he doesnt appear in the show assuming he doesnt â personally i always saw him as a bit part guy but i could be wrong about that i really hope you are right because i hate the show"
"StrollofShame",2014-05-08,"i could be wrong but i was certainly under the impression that coldhands is a wight  not an other in which case im not sure i understand how his nature might make anyone assume much of anything about the others except that he probably became a wight due to them my feeling was that he was recreated as an intelligent wight by bloodraven in some manner we know nothing aboutyet if anything maybe the question should be what is the directionmotivation of bloodraven  the children when you consider coldhands if you think that all we learned from the show about the others is that they make other others from babies  that we werent shown the possibility of them being much much more such as having organization  hierarchy  performing complicated ritualmagic then i guess i saw that scene entirely differently"
"Yojimbo",2014-05-08,"thats just your read though not part of the actual others mythos we have no idea whether or not coldhands is in any way associated with them he expands the mythos of the universe in general showing its possible for an undead human to be something other than a mindless zombie under the thrall of an ice demon which i figured was important at the time but who knows its entirely possible the books never explain who or what he is its also possible that does matter but the show will just introduce the idea in another way its hard to believe theyll cut it completely if its actually importantâ â and your completely right it is after all just my interpretation one am not even sure myself if i think is 100 correct but i just cant shake the feeling coldhands still has a part to play in the story i can also see your point that you have a hard time believeing they would cut something out of the story if it was actually important but i myself have even a harder time believeing george would allow the show to give spoilershint to which direction the remaining books are going because the show is going to be finished by a good few years before the remaining books are after all what book to film transalation has ever been 100 faithful â i could be wrong but i was certainly under the impression that coldhands is a wight  not an other in which case im not sure i understand how his nature might make anyone assume much of anything about the others except that he probably became a wight due to them my feeling was that he was recreated as an intelligent wight by bloodraven in some manner we know nothing aboutyet if anything maybe the question should be what is the directionmotivation of bloodraven  the children when you consider coldhands if you think that all we learned from the show about the others is that they make other others from babies  that we werent shown the possibility of them being much much more such as having organization  hierarchy  performing complicated ritualmagic then i guess i saw that scene entirely differently â â from what been described he has the simularties of a wight but he has black eyes not the pale blue like other wights and i agree with your questions about bloodraven  the children but this is where i have a hard time buying into that the show is giving us infomation about the others before the books i honestly cant see any author allowing some one else to divulge into infomation that he or she has not brought up himherself do you really think the show is going to tell us the end of the story of a song and ice fire before george does or do you think it more likely the show and the books are going to seperate more and more as the series goes on because after all it going to be only 7 seasons and am not in the camp who believes the books are going to be finished before the show edited by yojimbo 08 may 2014  0907 pm"

"Emperoreddy",2014-05-06,"something to notice about cersei this week â she only takes two sips of wine throughout the entire episodeâ and she doesnt finish the glass that her father gave her before leaving â i think these scenes could become an important counterpoint to the type of plotting that we are going to see next season â even last week she was drunk during her confrontation with jaime â you think they will play up her drinking as a big catalyst for the stupid stuff she does ive been wondering how they will portray cersei next season and i feel like pw gave us some hints on how it will look her lashing at pycelle then ordering the feast to the dogs just to spite the tyrells and flash some power the little gleeful smile she has when its done this im a bitch and i love it look â also her plays this week werent so much about giving the judges what they want but more an attempt to paint herself as the victim and a sympathetic person the tyrells know cersei was completely against margs marriage but her presenting the new marriage is an attempt to show she has changed as well as admitting the stuff about joff i think marg sees through it in the end and that is why she brought up the marriage to loras and the digs of calling her both sister and mother which you could tell she loathed hearing she is giving tywin the daughter he wants a daughter that puts family first by setting the dates he sees right through it though she is trying to come off as the bleeding heart mourning mother to oberyn trying to relate and show they arent that different â next week i imagine she drops the hammer just painting tyrion as a child killer and her the poor victim mother"

"Jinjonator",2014-05-05,"considering jon and bran dont actually have enough material in the books to properly carry them through the season there was literally no choice but to make things up in order to give them something to do before the end of the season i havent heard any suggestions from people saying this plotline shouldnt have been included about what invented material wouldve been preferable because again inventing new material was the only option unless you literally believe that having both characters do absolutely nothing until the end is somehow better edited by jinjonator 05 may 2014  0528 am"

is slowly setting up the role of the woman who is clearly the leader of crasters wives i suspect she will end up being the woods witch who leads the wildlings to hardhome this is likely an important

"Hippocras",2014-05-05,"rockroi sobasically your argument is that the information that was communicated in this sequence should have been split up into several different scenes this means you simply fail yo acknowledge the severe constraints particularly in terms of of runtime that the show has they need to compress things together and communicate as much development as possible in as few scenes as possible your argument requires adding another 3 episodes just to accommodate the scenes you think should have happened instead the time it would take to show a preliminary wildling attack on the wall for the same purpose of establishing jon as a battle commander would have been about the same but would not have advanced brans story or the hardhome story simultaneously as for hardhome and the woods witchseriously you dont care thats your argument you do realize that the events at hardhome are quite a big deal in jons future story right probably in brans story as well"

"Jairion Lannister",2014-05-05,"i thought it was fairly good people are judging it as filler from what they know of the books but that shouldnt be the case it should be judged from the perspective of the show and what this meant â jon had already made it clear that failure to eliminate the rogue nw men would mean the wildlings would soon realise that they could easily attack the wall and take it as they didnt have as many men as jon had told them from a show watchers perspective thats the point here they want to see whether jon can eliminate these men and maintain the silence that the nw isnt equipped to hold the wall the scenes at crasters are intended to remind us of what theyre up against of who theyre facing and so we can get some satisfaction from these guys being killed â the part with bran is filler until he reaches the three eyed crow but it was good filler for a show viewer who doesnt know whether bran will be successful it creates more tension what will happen will brans group survive will bran and jon be reunited i wish wed have seen coldhands but even then this creates a lot of tension and puts our protagonists in tight stops where we wonder if theyll survive or not â the most disappointing part was after all of the build up locke was simply killed in the end when he couldve served a really good purpose to the nw storyline although apart from that most of those storyline was done quite well"

the one you mention  electing jon as the lord commander its legitimate to find it a stretch i dont to be honest because jon was always portrayed as a brilliant young man who everybody tries to befriend or recruit hes like the only one tyrion ever addressed as a friend right again his appointment as lc is an extraordinary event and i guess georges aware of it because for example he does make sam going through the history books to see is jon the youngest ever but it also means grrm addressed the issue and went great lengths to explainjustify it you can still find it unrealistic but a story as big as asoiaf is would probably be very shallow without some extraordinary developments that are little stretching â on the other hand the show is simply ridiculous too often im talking tvinvented material just look at this sequence at the crasters the whole premise is moronic what jons now playing some intelligence war against mance is that dds version of the cold war its one thing to lie mance when he asks you a direct question but its something completely different to organize a raiding party in order to prevent mance from finding out some info that he is very likely to find out anyhow logically just going to crasters to fight mutineers is more potentially more dangerous and damaging than letting them stay there and then the whole locke thing i mean last season locke was one of the changes that didnt do any harm i did miss vargo and especially in hindsight hed be much better for the show than locke was but at least locke change didnt inflict any damage last season the actor did a very decent job his lines were not stupid and he served a purpose in the story but this season like what was his mission what was the order roose gave him go alone with nobody else on your own completely without any hep whatsoever and bring me back two stark boys does it sounds like a sane idea to anyone who thinks about it for a minute especially because br were discussed by boltons as a pressing matter â and then we have posters here reasoning that the change was needed in order for jon to built his reputation well the whole reason his reputation is so poor is that dd destroyed it and im not talking about his instory reputation im talking his image among viewers why would any viewers think jon is a competent fellow did he do anything competent in the show after season 1 not a god damn thing hes alive by pure fluke as tormund explained â the whole mess makes no sense at all and just when i remember those discussions from some two years ago when showapologists were parroting that changes were necessary because of time or money or whatever when it was pretty obvious from the beginning that the most damaging changes were the product of dds incompetence and i really dont see what is the problem with admitting their writings as incompetent as it gets why is it so hard to realize what is this infatuation with the two of them is it because of their constant whining that their job is oh so hard i dont know but honestly id advise them to stop bothering any more obviously whatever they do its going to be welcomed by showapologists if stuff like this from this season is welcomed by the audience everything will be"

"allie4645",2014-05-05,"by that logic the show nor the books should have emphasized ned stark since he was going to be dead before the end of the first book you might as well argue that paying sean bean whatever they paid him was pointless because he just died the screenwriters know better what they are doing than we do so its up to them to make those decisions â â pretty clear that they had checked all of the tents already before it even got to that point and keep in mind these ladies dont trust them anymore than they trusted the other crows â because it seems that coldhands was an unnecessary character that didnt contribute to the plot and could have confused a lot of people  didnt you just argue that this whole scene was a waste of time and money coldhands would have been an even bigger waste having jon and his men tidy things up closes that arc imo and the show needs all of the excitement it can get with the books that its about to adapt â why would arya be depressed not everyone gets depressed when a loved one dies some hold the grief in others get angry arya is angry â nope i never did assume that why because then the viewers would see the betrayal coming from a mile off and that scene is all about the surprise of it keeping locke there would have ruined the surprise completely except that ned had an impact on the story he had an arc development and his story ultimately set up several main arcs in the series the villains at ck did none of that they were bad guys everyone including the showonly watchers knew would be taken out theres no way either of brans or jons story arcs were set up to end there because it wouldnt make any sense im not saying that characters with buildup cant die im just saying that their deaths cant be meaningless and i think it was pretty obvious two main characters wouldnt die in the middle of nowhere with no impact whatsoever so why spend so much screen time on the mutineers raping and rambling while drinking out of skulls instead of showing something a bit more pertinent to the overall plot i understand that the show writers know whats going to happen in the longterm and that they know what goes into making a show but im also not going to pretend that gives them a free pass to do whatever with no criticism at all i personally think that ck could have been edited down more effectively and still have had the same impact as far as character developmentâ â i didnt realize that they checked all the huts already but i guess that makes sense seeing as they were laying out the bodies also even if crasters wives didnt fully trust jon why does that keep him from asking its not a major issue or anything im just confused about why that point was left openended seeing as there was some build up to it in the previous episode and it seems that closure of it in the future if there is any at all will be somewhat awkward since it wasnt handled immediatelyâ â and coldhands does contribute to the plot he leads them to br bran knows he has to go north but how does he know where exactly to go is he supposed to search the entire stretch of land north of the wall until he happens to run into the specific weirwood hes looking for i dont see how introducing one character to clean up ck and guide bran to where he needs to get is an even bigger waste than what weve seen these past two episodes i still think they will need to introduce ch because how are a crippled boy a mentally handicapped man and two teenagers one of whom is extremely ill supposed to get safely where they need to be through ww wights wildlings etc without help and without a map also maybe i didnt communicate this effectively but i dont have a problem with jon being the one to take out the mutineers it was necessary to establish jon as a potential leader in the future i just think there was so much time spent on it when it could have been handled more cleanly to maintain the bulk of other relevant plot linesâ â and heres my problem with arya she just gets vengeful but still maintains a positive attitude which is what weve already seen from her a million times its even stranger because the deaths of cat and robb are not the same as the deaths of yoren or lommy or mycah how is it possible that shes suffered the worst losses of her life but has not changed or developed since the beginning of s2 its understandable that shes angry but every hope that she was clinging to since ned died were crushed and all we get from her is a few names added to her hit list it makes her kind of needlessly onedimensional imo and im still legitimately curious about why she wants to kill beric and thoros ive clearly forgotten something â and if locke werent going to stick around why was he there just to serve in this teeny tiny arc that lasted 2 episodes i assumed that he would serve a greater purpose in the arc on the wall i liked him and wanted to see more of him and assumed his antics would somehow further the plot so i was just kind of disappointed and had kind of a huh thats all moment when he died obviously thats just a personal preference but there was just something kind of meh and

"sj4iy",2014-05-05,"except that ned had an impact on the story he had an arc development and his story ultimately set up several main arcs in the series the villains at ck did none of that they were bad guys everyone including the showonly watchers knew would be taken out theres no way either of brans or jons story arcs were set up to end there because it wouldnt make any sense im not saying that characters with buildup cant die im just saying that their deaths cant be meaningless and i think it was pretty obvious two main characters wouldnt die in the middle of nowhere with no impact whatsoever so why spend so much screen time on the mutineers raping and rambling while drinking out of skulls instead of showing something a bit more pertinent to the overall plot i understand that the show writers know whats going to happen in the longterm and that they know what goes into making a show but im also not going to pretend that gives them a free pass to do whatever with no criticism at all i personally think that ck could have been edited down more effectively and still have had the same impact as far as character developmentthe arc of the mutineers in the show is to kill mormont and later on showcase jons leadership abilities they arent pointlessâ â i didnt realize that they checked all the huts already but i guess that makes sense seeing as they were laying out the bodies also even if crasters wives didnt fully trust jon why does that keep him from asking its not a major issue or anything im just confused about why that point was left openended seeing as there was some build up to it in the previous episode and it seems that closure of it in the future if there is any at all will be somewhat awkward since it wasnt handled immediatelywhy would jon ask when he doesnt know that bran was ever thereâ â â and coldhands does contribute to the plot he leads them to br bran knows he has to go north but how does he know where exactly to go is he supposed to search the entire stretch of land north of the wall until he happens to run into the specific weirwood hes looking for i dont see how introducing one character to clean up ck and guide bran to where he needs to get is an even bigger waste than what weve seen these past two episodes i still think they will need to introduce ch because how are a crippled boy a mentally handicapped man and two teenagers one of whom is extremely ill supposed to get safely where they need to be through ww wights wildlings etc without help and without a map also maybe i didnt communicate this effectively but i dont have a problem with jon being the one to take out the mutineers it was necessary to establish jon as a potential leader in the future i just think there was so much time spent on it when it could have been handled more cleanly to maintain the bulk of other relevant plot linesthe entire purpose of coldhands was replaced by bran having a vision on where to go remember he said i know where we have to go last season and the nights watch doing the job that they should have done in the books and you forgot to add a big ass dire wolf in your list of brans partyâ â and heres my problem with arya she just gets vengeful but still maintains a positive attitude which is what weve already seen from her a million times its even stranger because the deaths of cat and robb are not the same as the deaths of yoren or lommy or mycah how is it possible that shes suffered the worst losses of her life but has not changed or developed since the beginning of s2 its understandable that shes angry but every hope that she was clinging to since ned died were crushed and all we get from her is a few names added to her hit list it makes her kind of needlessly onedimensional imo and im still legitimately curious about why she wants to kill beric and thoros ive clearly forgotten somethingif you think that arya has a positive attitude you arent paying attention her face is nearly emotionless unless she gets angry shes not been happy since kings landingâ â â and if locke werent going to stick around why was he there just to serve in this teeny tiny arc that lasted 2 episodes i assumed that he would serve a greater purpose in the arc on the wall i liked him and wanted to see more of him and assumed his antics would somehow further the plot so i was just kind of disappointed and had kind of a huh thats all moment when he died obviously thats just a personal preference but there was just something kind of meh and anticlimactic about lockes deathmy problem with lockes involvement is that we dont know what hes planning on doing with bran or why he tries to carry him off while leaving the others alive i will easily admit that it could have been handled better in that respect i have no problem with him dying though he was never going to become jons right hand man anyway because that would have been too obvious edited by sj4iy 05 may 2014  0435 pm"

"Miodrag",2014-05-05,"because you seem to be trying to convince people that the book is better than the episode because it is more believable thats why i said prove your argument its the basis for debate sam made it so that jon was put on the ballot so to speak still isnt very believable that jon would win the popular vote when many people still believe him to be a turncloack as we see in adwd later on of course the mutineers dont have any houndsbut craster could have he had plenty of other animals like sheep rabbits and pigs why are dogs so ridiculous and namecalling jon is a moron is pretty pointless when you cant seem to back up the reason why you think he is no the show didnt they changed the timing they added the trial and then added scenes where jon proves his leadership skills helping the men in the training yard warning them of the danger the mutineers pose asking the men for volunteers and then finally having him lead those men to kill the mutineers none of that was in the books and it expands jons character in a way that didnt happen in the books before he was elected lc and show jon still has more opportunities to prove his abilities in the fight ahead youve yet to back up your assertion as to why any of that is unbelievable jon proved himself in battle to less than 3040 men who were left at castle black while the rest were out fighting the wildling feints when those other men came back several of the men he proved himself to were dead and jon was thrown into the ice cells to die he was only taken out when aemon insisted and then given a suicide mission as a way to prove his innocencewhich ends up miraculously interrupted when stannis men sweep in and defeat mance rayders forces jon is never given a trial and many of the men believe hes a traitor it was pretty unbelievable that the men would choose to elect jon over more experienced men like cotter pyke when there were still lingering questions about his loyalty the show has resolved that issue by giving jon many other opportunities to prove himself before the big battle comes â of course the book version is more believable simply by not having ridiculous developments like some locke guy volunteering for nw how would that even work please his angle im interested in you join the order that is for life just to get some info and then run away knowing its punishable by death

possibly had hounds you say all right how come jon doesnt remember that but even that aside why the hell would they avoid hounds with the tactics theyve chosen theyre charging chained hounds are of no

think tv jons a moron and hes a moron because other characters say so not in so many words but youre even dumber than you look comes pretty close dont you think not to mention ygritte constantly besting him in every argument they had â all of that didnt happen in the books youre talking about the problem the show created in the novels jon is trusted and respected from the start hes hated by

sound like he has some reputation issues in the books he didnt opposite to the show he was very well respected in the novels just recall what aemon says to him when he handles him the wall just remember donal a character that doesnt exist in the show isnt he important for jons credibility as a character of course he is but hes omitted from the show while we have some karl fellow and his mutiny â the show created this problem with jons reputation and his competence and then they tried to solve it but they failed because jon looks not a bit more competent than before the last episode hes as incompetent as he was with qhorin in the novels on the other hand hes always respected and hes capable of carrying out the toughest missions like infiltrating the wildlings  while in the show he was effectively saved by ygritte i mean in the books it was he who saved ygritte which is why he saved him back the first chance she got on tv he didnt save her she saved herself from him he refused to kill her but he didnt let her go he didnt know what to do with her and then he lost his brothers by chasing her and then she lead him into a trap practically she owed him nothing in the show he didnt earn even her help small wonder his competence and respect had to be built from the scratch at this point book jon has no such problems other than jerks like alliser and janos brothers

and then she lead him into a trap practically she owed him nothing in the show he didnt earn even her help small wonder his competence and respect had to be built from the scratch at this point book jon has no such problems other than jerks like alliser and janos brothers usually love and respect jon and we can see the reasons why the show is an entirely different thing in that regardstating your opinion as fact doesnt actually make it true you know the show didnt create any problems which didnt already exist in the texthes as incompetent as he was with qhorin  in both the show and the books he couldnt actually beat quorin in a real fight quorin lets him kill him both timeshes always respected  we must have been reading different books he wasnt respected at all in the beginning and had to build up the trusteven then he still did things to shatter that trust like his attempted desertion quorin picked him because he thought it would be more believable that jon desert than any of his rangers who had killed wildlings already that was why quorin gave him the task of beheading ygritte because he wanted to see what jon would dohe didnt save her  he didnt behead her when he could have he saved her life and she even admits as much when she saves him from rattleshirtshe leads him into a trap  they are led into a trap in the books how is it that differentshe owed him nothing in the show  yes she did and she stated it when she said were even after saving him from rattleshirt in the prince of winterfellbook jon has no such problems  so all of those guys in the book who talk about him behind his back and question his decisions to his face arent problems"

"Miodrag",2014-05-05,"ive admitted that lockes role could have been thought out better but if you remember in the book a nice dead guy riding a dead elk appeared out of nowhere killed the mutineers and led bran to his destination that was one of the worst examples of deus ex machina in the entire series theres not reason to believe that jon would remember much about the keep or which animals craster had he could have easily acquired them in the time after the nights watch left he may have had them and the mutineers killed them this argument is nothing but a straw man jon looks like a man who needs all of the help he can get on a dangerous mission accepting the help of a man who he knows can fight he knew the man for a few days and had no reason to suspect him of anything saying that hes stupid because he couldnt see what the audience has seen is a logical fallacy no im saying that he has a reputation after he runs off with the enemy thats a pretty damn hard reputation to shake and he doesnt really do it in the books before being elected lord commander its touched upon several times in adwd that some of the men think hes a turn cloak and dont trust him how does jon prove his credibility to everyone before being elected lord commander how does he prove his innocence he doesnt because he has no trial and his deeds are not witnessed by enough people stating your opinion as fact doesnt actually make it true you know the show didnt create any problems which didnt already exist in the text hes as incompetent as he was with qhorin  in both the show and the books he couldnt

she did and she stated it when she said were even after saving him from rattleshirt in the prince of winterfell book jon has no such problems  so all of those guys in the book who talk about him behind his back and question his decisions to his face arent problems â we obviously read different books in books i read qhorin sees a leader in jon and tutors him just like aemon just like jeor qhorin and jon were not lead into a trap  they were pursued and eventually caught by wildlings but not entrapped in fact qhorin chose jon over other rangers to stay with him until the end jon didnt have to chase ygritte  once he decided against killing her he let her go while in the show she freed herself from him in a rather ridiculous way one might add in the books i read ygritte isnt ridiculing jons worldviews so efficiently â also youre ignoring what i wrote about the hounds why do the hounds matter at all with the tactics jon and crew chosen how is it possible not to see through lockes lie because of that how is it possible that literally nobody among the attackers checked the hut locke was talking about even further how is it possible none of the mutineers tried to take jons brother as a hostage as soon as they were attacked â re jon trusting locke  if a viewer sees one man playing another like a violin the reputation of the latter has to suffer dont you agree theoretically you could be right that not every viewer is going to think jons a moron for trusting locke but i dont think any of the viewers is going to think very highly of jons intelligence after that i mean locke is not the smartest guy around and he still manages to fool jon so easily so if i had to guess id say majority of the viewers thought it was very stupid on jons part to trust that fellow and one more point youre also ignoring if not for brans warging jon would actually enable locke to capture bran â about his reputation you keep going back to no it is not nearly as damaged as you describe it if guys like aemon and donal noye put you in charge of the wall in a decisive battle it counts a lot before adwd is there anyone besides alliser and janos and rast truth be told who dislikes jon i cant remember at the time but i dont think so its true hes accused of treason but then again he did come back to the wall to warn his brothers and he does tell a very believable story about him and qhorin a story that fits the popular opinion on jon a popular opinion that doesnt exist in the show â and if you have a problem with coldhands or the very concept of magicalsupernatural elements and you obviously dont particularly like or respect the plot i cant help but wonder what do you enjoy in asoiaf at all im just curious"

bomb that he wants to take jon on the mission north which leaves mormont perplexedâ â what was it in there wherein qhorin halfhand saw â<U+0080><U+009C>a leaderâ<U+0080><U+009D> in jonâ did he â<U+0080>wrastleup the bacon in a particularly heroic manner now i get some of the context qhorin knows of jon snow the direwolf comment and he knows the familylineâ but what was it about jon snowâ<U+0080> saying â<U+0080><U+009C>hiâ<U+0080><U+009D> that made qhorin see a leaderâ and why was jeor so caught offguard if it seemed natural that jon was such a leaderâ â here is my point there is questionable writing in the books as wellâ at times is shallow martin uses some shorthand to move the story alongâ there are times were characters draw conclusions quickly and do things that require more explanation than given i mean  again using jon as an example the lannisters are the richest family in westeros yet they lack a valayrian steel sword â jon snow â he gets one after being in the nw for all of 3 months â â in other words its not just the show that tries to gloss over things or take shortcuts â martin did toâ â now i am going to briefly address some of your other points but for brevityâ<U+0080><U+0099>s sake i am only going to dedicate a few words that and remember that i ultimately agree with you on crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s keep especially your biting point that after the liberation is over â<U+0080> how come none of the wives mention to js that for a few days there were three highborn people in the camp along with a giantâ that ah seems relevantâ<U+0080> â on the subject of ygritte â â jon didnt have to chase ygritte  once he decided against killing her he let her go while in the show she freed herself from him in a rather ridiculous way one might add in the books i read ygritte isnt ridiculing jons worldviews so efficiently â â i agree with the first point and quibble with the secondâ ygritte is ridiculing jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s world view in the books but she has more time to do it it takes the form of narratives and long stories because well we have the timeâ â i also thought jon defended his world â<U+0080><U+0093>view better in the show than in the books and overall i kinmd of like ygrittes jibbing of jon snow  she even seems to be making fun of bookjon snow her mockery of how he has slain men and ww but hes afraid of a naked girl â i think that ygrittes humor and style edgy rough mocking is refreshing in a world so dour â â though to be fair there was nothing worse than the season 3 finale where ygritte a woman with no riding experience and no knowledge of the north somehow was able to track down jon snow â<U+0080><U+0093> an experienced rider with ample knowledge of the terrainâ â on dormer as maergery and renly â you made the point that both were miscastâ i disagree on bothâ maergery and renly are for better or worse different characters in the show than in the booksâ maergery is far more prominent and renly sadly far differentâ dormerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s maergery is really fun to watch she is powerhungry and scheming which makes her more compelling â is she the same as her character on the tudorsâ yes and no but ultimately thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a far greater indictment of the tudors than it is of dormer â<U+0080><U+0093> the show did very little with any of their female characters outside of henryâ<U+0080><U+0099>s first spanish wife and dormerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ann was fine but as you said yourself â<U+0080><U+0093> sometimes actors cannot get away from bad writing i think she puts a lot more polich on her acting gives it more zip more life and definitely more edge â â renly was just poorly writtenâ in the books renly is a dashing charming knight with a deep understanding of what he is doing and whyâ in the show he has been replaced by a wishywashy unsure and uninspired little man who is a puppet of a greater house that charming ersatzrobert is gone and replaced by â<U+0080> franklyâ<U+0080> a clichaâ i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t blame the actor i blame the part â and maybe the showrunnersâ<U+0080><U+0099> greatest fail has been stannis and their belief that renly would â<U+0080><U+009C>unquestionablyâ<U+0080><U+009D> be a better king than stannisâ it boggles the mind that they actually thought thatâ â on dilante not watching the show and danceâ demandingâ a bigger part â in the huffington post piece that was linked dilante seems to really like the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s story and speaks of it very highly in the story you linked he only says he does not watch he does not seem to be making a judgement on its qualityâ as others have stated this can be for many reasons butâ dilante would not be the first actor who did not watch themselves on tv or film iirc the woman who played cat also never watched herselfâ its not a rare thing and certainly not indicative of a man who hates the show heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s on â and pays his bills â â the rumor that dance threatened to leave if they did not write him more stuffâ mehâ<U+0080> may be true may not â i find it hard to believe considering dance must have known he would have a small part in season 1 so why would he wait until before season 2 to start complainingâ chances are they told dance that the part would grow bigger and dance â<U+0080><U+0093> to one degree or another kept them to their word â i have heard many interviews from dance that he thinks the writing is great â also there are a variety of stories out there that the actors love the show and many do more publicity than you would think if they did not â now this does not prove anything but its a counter to the point that its a sign f how much the actors have control over the show â â on hbo not backing dd during the â<U+0080><U+009C>george w bushâ<U+0080><U+009D> head thing â i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see a rift between hbo and dd because they distanced themselves from the revelation the â<U+0080><U+009C>revelationâ<U+0080><U+009D> was on the dvd commentary it did not hit the mainstream media for many weeks laterâ i think that hbo could think dd are the greatest most superior writers of the last 4 generations and they still would have done that actionâ whyâ because thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s how corporations act they do not want controversy or glitches in public perception to ruin or interfere with the â<U+0080><U+009C>goose that is laying the golden eggâ<U+0080><U+009D>â hbo up until got was riding a string of losers and missteps big love bored to death the comeback enlightened hung luck in treatment no 1 ladies det agency â<U+0080><U+0093> even their successes rome deadwood had been pulled for costs or difficulties with writersâ even their â<U+0080><U+009C>hitsâ<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+0093> boardwalk empire for instance were pedestrian or not popular with audiences the wire while a critical success never caught on with the general publicâ gotâ<U+0080><U+0099>s trajectory had no ceiling after that first season and hbo was not going to let a small controversy over a fake expresidentâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head get in the wayâ that really has nothing to do with support or difficulty with dd â now other issues you had frankly i agree with the â<U+0080><U+009C>pervertâ<U+0080><U+009D> line the jaimerape scene etc and i do think they show some problems with the show at the same time this is ddâ<U+0080><U+0099>s first work on any tv show and i guess to you it showsâ i think they have done pretty well so farâ â to me i think the sourcematerial is a major reason for the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s success but that is by no means a guarantee for success in tvfilm look no further than bonfire of the vanities and any shakespeare adaptation â further the show has added in a lot of scenes and ideas and stories that have been really fun to watch mostly characterinteraction not addressed in the books tywinarya robertcersei etc â and to me that makes crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s keep such a disappointment while to you its more of â<U+0080><U+009C>what did you expectâ<U+0080><U+009D> â i expect moreâ i think the show that can deliver blackwater and the red wedding and tywin lannister talking and maergery tyrell eating up the scenery and tyrion and wit sarcasm and charm i think that show has to do a better job â and not do shorthand like they did at crasterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s keepâ â otherwiseâ<U+0080> we are lost â"

"Miodrag",2014-05-06,"snip â this has to be the most thoughtful and most serious disagreement with myself i ever encountered on this site and i encountered any number of those i thank you for that i appreciate it big time â now to work first iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m a bookpurist people here treat it as some kind of disease it is not it is a general stance on adaptations meaning if it was on me iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d always try to stay as close to the source material as possible that is neither a fault nor a virtue on its own but my preference and honestly i think itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s among the most logical one why would i want to change something i love and respect example i dislike â<U+0080><U+009C>dracarysâ<U+0080><U+009D> moment from the books for my taste it was too predictable and too easy in short â<U+0080><U+0093> too convenient it wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t terrible i like the prose in that chapter but itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bellow the standard grrm himself set but if i was to adapt the books into tv show i wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t change it because i know readers predominantly love the scene in fact it is one of the most iconic scenes in danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s entire arc according to readersâ<U+0080><U+0099> reactions and that â<U+0080><U+0093> the reward it brought to so many readers â<U+0080><U+0093> would be the most important thing for me i would never try to â<U+0080><U+009C>improveâ<U+0080><U+009D> that in adaptation because iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d trust the general results grrm achieved more than iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d trust my own opinion on a particular scene like if my own creativity is the most important thing for me then what the hell am i doing with another manâ<U+0080><U+0099>s work that is the way iâ<U+0080><U+0099>d treat any work i respect but i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t expect everyone to think like me that would be ridiculous so no i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t deny dd the right to change things from the source material it is between them grrm and hbo to decide how much theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re going to change on the other hand iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m still going to have an opinion about each of their changes why not however that opinion isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t clouded by my purism itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s utterly arrogant to think that criticism of the show may stem only from bookpurism like many showlovers argue constantly that ridiculous accusation is usually delivered by posters who themselves have opinions clouded by any number of things visual medium that inspires socalled â<U+0080><U+009C>passive consummationâ<U+0080><U+009D> advertising campaign promotional videos interviews and even by other posters the level of conformism in our day and age is alarming and this forum is sadly not an exception â i repeat none of the issues i have with the show is in any way related to my purism i manage to separate impressions from opinions quite fine therefore i know there are changes and there are changes even bad changes differ among themselves some are damaging on the long run some are damaging only shortterm and some are utterly pointless but not damaging behind some bad changes there was a good idea but the execution went wrong â letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s focus for a moment on tywinarya scenes majority thinks those were some great scenes but when you challenge that notion it always boils down to this it was great to see dance and maisie together and they both are quite powerful on screen indeed but is it a good enough reason for the change i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think so because roose is also played by a very good and charismatic actor and rooseâ<U+0080><U+0099>s conversation with arya wouldâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve been more instrumental in asoiaf universe roose is simply more important for the story than tywin is though both are very important secondary characters so storywise itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s more rewarding to flesh roose than tywin thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s what george did in acok and besides putting scenes just so that two actors can work together is somewhat shallow like what wouldâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve happen if dance was cast as yoren for example would the show extend yorenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s storyline so that he and arya can have more screentime together this â<U+0080><U+009C>actors first writing secondâ<U+0080><U+009D> approach is not my favorite to tell the truth but all in all tywinarya scenes ruined nothing it achieved very little and the general story lost much by omitting roosearya scenes but in show universe it was not bad like i said how much potential of the source material will dd use is on them hbo and to a lesser extent grrm â but what i find an exaggeration of the highest order is this notion that tywinarya scenes were an improvement of the source material oneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s perfectly entitled to think it really is an improvement but iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m also perfectly entitled to view that notion only as a result of misunderstanding or misremembering aryaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s acok arc and when i say that those aggressive showlovers tend to accuse me of purism and like yes i am a purist but that has nothing to do with how superior book story is to the show story in that case or in any other case for that matter iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m still to hear about any improvement the show made on the books â and then there are simply bad changes not because theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re changes but because theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re badly scripted scenes like amory nonsense from season two like whores giving the money back to pod like shae angrily refusing diamonds from tyrion only to be not angry at all in the very next scene two of them have together like jaime killing alton for no reason at all â<U+0080><U+0093> yes itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s also kinslaying but in the show universe kinslaying was never established as a grave sin but killing the one person whoâ<U+0080><U+0099>s willing and capable of helping you in your escape is simply bad writing like having brienne carry two swords so jaime can conveniently grab one which couldâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve been avoided by moving the scene from season two finale in which brienne kills stark soldiers to season three â<U+0080><U+0093> however that would require some longterm planning like theon being knocked down not before he delivers the speech and so on â it doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t mean books are perfect but nothing ever is perfect people seem to think that if a work didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t achieve perfection itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a good enough justification to â<U+0080><U+009C>improveâ<U+0080><U+009D> the said work funny enough those same people often bitch when someone criticizes something they love the show but it goes beyond hypocrisy itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pure disrespect for creativity just look at how often production difficulties are discussed here and truth be told this show is very challenging production wise possibly the most challenging show ever in that regard but no production difficulties can match the biggest difficulty in any creative process starting from a blank page creation of deep and engaging characters that go through the rich plot that also emphasizes and examines rewarding themes â<U+0080><U+0093> that is the most difficult thing in storytelling regardless of the medium that delivers the story if one fails to realize that oneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hardly fit to discuss creative decisions regardless of their actual quality â even with imperfections the novels stand those endless tests theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re put to in discussions on this and many other sites the reason is theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re never ridiculous there are scenes you or i find subpar but in each of those scenes we can at least figure out whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going through the heads of characters involved you think qhorinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reasons for choosing jon are underexplained which is a legitimate remark but as you noticed itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s easy for a reader to come up with some explanation that sounds reasonable opposite to that what was going through lockeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head when he tricked jon and the crew into avoiding the hut with bran and company â<U+0080><U+009C>everythingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going to be ok if they stay away from the hut because iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m gonna take the boy and run and nobodyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going to catch meâ<U+0080><U+009D> or when he joined nw â<U+0080><U+009C>iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll take the oath that is for life and breaking of which is punishable by death because someone there must know something about those stark boys nobody heard off recentlyâ<U+0080><U+009D> what can possibly go through talisaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head when she asks a king she just met for the first time about his ultimate strategy and political goals what can possibly go through talisaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head when she asks robb is he angry at her because sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pregnant what is going on through pyat preeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head at any given moment why is tywin at first saving prisoners because as he says lannisters need every single body but then starts executing his own soldiers not the prisoners mind you when amory is killed by the way what happened to the said investigation that was more important than lives of lannister soldiers and how come no lannister soldier remembers the girl amory was chasing not long ago and right before he was killed rattleshirt is releasing jon why exactly one of my favorites whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s going through margaeryâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head while sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s suggesting the threesome with loras is she having an incestuous relationship with loras did she just revealed it to renly or is she willing to have sex with her brother just so renly can get excited what is going through littlefingerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head when he decides to carry nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s bones to renlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s camp â and i could go on but you get the point purism has nothing to do with my biggest complaints as for the books i gladly discuss other peopleâ<U+0080><U+0099>s complaints on them but not when booksâ<U+0080><U+0099> possible imperfections are brought up just so the showlovers can â<U+0080><U+009C>defendâ<U+0080><U+009D> dd now there is one possible weak spot of the books that the show exposed when in season one shae tells tyrion that no girl would go to bed with him only hours after she was almost raped it does sound correct granted weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re still to find out what exactly happened with tysha but for now tv shaeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reasoning sounds more solid than jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s final confession to tyrion in the books also ned seeing arya and directing yoren toward her was a nice addition wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t call it an improvement because the chapter with nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s beheading hardly needs an improvement and i canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see how this addition could be added without ruining aryaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pov which would be a crime but for a tv show that isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t told through povâ<U+0080><U+0099>s it was a nice addition and theon burning the letter was a good adaptation considering the show does lack both time and the insight into theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head to convey his

shored up and a plan needs to be implemented mance already has the key to his victory essentially but theres a big difference in how to approach this battle if the watch has 1000 men versus 100 men we can assume mance doesnt want thousands upon thousands of his people to die if it can be avoided â â 1000 men or 100 men the only way mance is getting through that wall is through the tunnel how much time does the night watch need to work this out not like they been there as a order for 3000 yeanever mind how much training does the night watch need to drop barrels of ice and stones of the top of the wall but of cource am edging my bets that the night watch will do a 300 stand off in the tunnel and get saved by stannis in the nick of time and your quite right mance book and show doesnt want thousands and thousands of his people to die just book mance had no choice when the raiding party failed â also you dont have mances tentative plan right the plan for the raiding party isnt to take castle black in the show the force isnt large enough based on what has been presented it seems to me that his plan is to arrange his army near the wall and light the biggest fire the north has ever seen in order to focus the attention of the watch away from the south which is why both raiding parties have had a warg with them so that the bird can alert the raiding party to make their assault from the south with the obvious intention of catching the watch unaware and opening the gate from their side with jon having escaped the plan was altered which is why the wildlings are attempting to draw the nights watch out of castle black by attacking villages south of the wall the overall plan seems to be the same â â sorry i forgot the brothers of the nights watch have the mentalities of moths right can see it now â sam maester aemon you should see the fire the wildlings have lit it the biggest the north has ever seen aemon my nephew would have loved this sam maester aemon sam turns around to see ygritte pulling her axe out of maester aemons head â whats more dont you think mance you know a former brother wouldnt think the remaining brothers at castle black will be defending that gate to the tunnel more tightly than cersia guards her  what does he think 20 say 50 now that the cannibles have shown up are going to really do except get butchered â and jon doesnt deduce that bran is in fact at crasters keep just that it is the only place they could logically have found shelter since the rest of the wildling villages are abandoned which has been mentioned several times if sam traveled south from crasters and ended up at the nightfort an obvious assumption could be made that bran and his party might run into the keep by traveling north along that same path neither one is sure or even alludes to truly believing that bran could be there based on the dialogue jon may have in some ways hopedâ that he was but none of his actions or dialogue make it seem like he was counting on it â â where did i say bran is at crasters keep jon thinks he may have gone there for shelter you would at least think jon would have asked one of crasters wives if they have possibly seen three children and a giant of a manno we getwe make our own way in this waste landandburn it down â as for jon beginning to show the men of the watch that he could be a suitable leader your complaints here dont really make sense shocker leading the assault on crasters keep quite clearly displays his leadership qualities in a way that makes his election believable its a progression one moment at the gate is enough in your eyes because for the past two seasons for the most part jon has been with the wildlings i mean this is selfexplanatory saying that theres no need to show jon blossoming into a true leader is just sillyâ â thorne  slynt being present provides some much needed conflict and dramatic tension getting more screentime for these two doesnt seem like a bad idea at all in my eyes and it certainly doesnt create any mess the context of the show is independent of that of the novels so it seems to me that your complaints mostly stem from trying to apply the logic of one scenario onto a mostly different scenario entirely â â yes by showing the watch that only losing 5 men to the 1015 men at craster keep is in the same league as holding of a attack of 200 wildlings by mustering up a defenese of the young old and crippled and hell in the books that was still not enough to swing things in jons favour and am not saying they shouldnt show jon blossoming into a true leader am saying the show has not shown it enough â name a show that doesnt have fillerill waitâ imo filler is okay so long as its of the entertaining variety â â as you know i cant  â to the second i agree filler

same editing technique is used for brans visions but instead of thinking about what could be the possible difference between using the technique for brans visions and using it for the concealing of poor choreography you go on and on about how shocked you are at my arguments and youre shocked not only as a film major but also as a human being and yet you found it fit to accuse me for a hyperbole â for the record the only reason for speeding up the fight footage was to conceal bad choreography if editorsdd thought the choreography was satisfying they wouldnt speed it up why they didnt use the same technique for other fight scenes because they werent unsatisfied with the footage and it doesnt necessarily mean the nedjaime footage was bad really but the editorsdd obviously thought it shouldve been better or more exciting and tried to improve it  by speeding up the footage and hoping the viewers arent going to notice it â had anything like that happened in the sopranos or the wire or true detective or breaking bad which also manipulated the speed in some action sequences but never in the hopefully viewers wont notice it sense or in any other respectable tv or film production someone would be fired â im not a big fan of the show and i give it a lot of flack myself but good lord this is probably the most ridiculous complaint ive ever read about anything seriously fight scenes are by definition illusions they are designed choreographed and edited to trick the audience into thinking theres an actual fight going on and not two stunt guys hitting each other with foam swords if they need to speed up the scene a little to make sean bean look like a competent fighter who the hell cares theres a lot to criticize about the show but speeding up literally a tenth of a second of a fight scene to make it more exciting is not one of those things â thats the thing the scene possibly looks more exciting only if you dont notice the speeding up once a viewer notices what they did the scene just cant look like an actual fight any more and sean bean doesnt look like a competent fighter any more that is not to be confused with a special effect and the amount has nothing to do with it again brans visions are also sped up the entirety of them but there is no problem precisely because the continuity isnt broken these two scenes i complain about are an entirely different case when you speed up only some parts of the footage you inevitably break the continuity you can do that for say artistic reasons just like its done sometimes and it doesnt mean the credibility for lack of a better word was broken because viewers are supposed to realize what you did and enjoy the artistic value of your decision thats what chinese directors do with fight scenes all the time theres a borderline case what cameron did in terminator 2  those fights between two terminators are all speed up but 1 the action itself is supposed to be inhuman because it involves superb fighting machines and 2 the entire action is sped up because otherwise it would look unacceptably clumsy and it would break the continuity and credibility of viewing experience however if one does that got style meaning just to improve the effect parts of the recorded action are supposed to have on viewers then its messing with continuity and credibility of the viewing experience â regardless of how many film majors and professional video editors here claim its a standard technique the fact remains they arent able to provide any example of a respectable production that done what got did â for the record i am a professional video editor and this argument is total nonsense â for the record total nonsense is the comparison you made between the scenes im complaining about and crouching tiger hidden dragonthe lord of the rings especially if youre a professional video editor you shouldve never make that comparison because whether in agreement or disagreement with me over got scenes a professional editor would immediately see the essential difference between those scenes and examples you provided â oh and heres some free advise about got editing you defend so aggressively dont ever do that in a serious production in real life because youll only loose the job â against the viewersâ what on earth are you talking aboutâ why would anybody care about using editing to create an impression and why would that be any different from any other effectâ because the sacredness of the screen â i criticize this show plenty on my own so im far from an automatic defender of itâ but this is one of the silliest criticism i have ever seen not just about this show but about any show â yes screen is the separate entity from the material youre watching via screen you see screen is for

"Uldra I",2014-05-09,"â you mean the whole weak plot line of not allowing the wildlings finding out about the nightswatch actual strength pray tell how would it make the situation there in any worse if mance actually found out what because mance now knows they have around 100200 men instead of a 1000 he now has the keys to victory infact isnt that the whole idea behind the raiding party that mance doesnt have to use his main force to break through the tunnel because he knows it would cost his wildlings too many lives but if he sends a small raiding force to take castle black unawares then he and his wildling horde can just march through the tunnel unopposedâ or do you mean the other can of worms the writers opened up when they decided sam couldnt keep his mouth shut and he spilled the beans to jon that bran is still alive so sam and jon are looking over a map and jon deduces the only place bran could possibly go for shelter beyound the wall is crasters keep â or the fact that jon has to prove his leadership qualities at all because the writers decided for the last 3 seasons jon snow knows nothing infact isnt jon going to prove his quilty when he defends castle black from the wildling raiding party attack to open the tunnel oh never mind because the writers decided to open another can of worms when they saw fit to have alliser and janos show up to castle black before the wildling suprise attack took place the writers of the show have decided to write themselves into this mess and now they are doing a poor job of writing themselves out of it the butterfly effect that is taking place ive got say is a very nice sight to see though â but then again what do i know right am the one who is not paying attention â â once again going to start with the statement i sincerely love the shows the writers cast crew artists directors everyone involved with the shows have done an amazing jobâ cant even imagine how they do it allâ brilliant is the word that comes to mind when i think of all the amazing talents that have lent their hands to the production of the entire seriesâ also realizing there are changes that have to happen because of the difference in mediumsâ imo until the last two episodes the changes seemed necessary and wise but not ones that really change martins story too muchâ â my apologies because i promised id not speak about this again but i just cant help myself â realizing that most people who post on internet forums are much younger than i am i suppose the action scenes would probably suit their tastes better than intrigue and character development so i can somewhat understand the overwhelming love of the crasters keep scenes in the last two episodesâ the more blood and sexual violence the better rightâ â â otohâ in the books coldhands is a much beloved and very mysterious figureâ he was our first realâ introduction to others â there could have been a couple of interesting scenes with him to flesh out the bran arc a littleâ ch could have even included the scene where he killed the mutineers who are wights by then in an off the scene moment from the books  there would be the fight with the wights in order to get bran into the cave a very exciting scene but didnt include rape or even nudity a limitation for some i knowâ jon has lots of negotiating and relationship building to do at the wallâ there are lots of things in the books that could make this storyline interesting enough for the show still no violence or even nudityâ sorry to sayâ why did dd have to go for filler â â just gotta sayâ â if they are going to write a new story then dd and whoever else is in charge of the storyline should at the very least stop implying they are trying to bring grrms story to screenâ they should just change the name of the series and give grrm credit for being an inspiration and go their merry way with the rest of the story â â â i cannot agree that what ever they make up between the beginning and the end of grrms series is acceptable as long as they reach the same end pointâ what an absurd and ridiculous argumentâ it will not be the same story if they tell a different story periodâ not saying the show is fubar yet but just saying this kind of disregard for the original story is playing it awfully close to that edge edited by dolorous lothston 09 may 2014  0920 pm"

"Cyvasse Khal",2014-05-05,"i think the reason she was so impressive in season 1 is noone had really heard of emilia clarke before and right away she is getting thrust into an uncomfortable nude scene with viserys she does really well with the confronting sexrape scenes with drogo she had to essentially learn a made up language and then act while speaking it throughout the whole season and we definitely see the transformation from vulnerable child to the reborn mother of dragons by seasons end it was a deserved emmy recognition â problem is in 1 season we have massive character transformation the following 3 seasons there is virtually none picking up little nuggets of wisdom on how to be a good queen along her travels doesnt qualify as evolving the character and so it has really felt like emilias acting has been pretty stagnant and same as but its mostly because her character is â having said that her delivery of lines has been irritating me of late like others have said in this thread she used to be pretty casual talking to jorah felt like a normal conversation these days no matter what the setting whos around whether its positive concerning threatening its all getting delivered in that same attempted confident regal tone"

"Fat Trell",2014-05-05,"i thought both emilia and iain glen were very disappointing in their scene together they honestly both looked stonedâ â the scene was far too rushed the dialogue was weak and completely lacked the severity that the book scene had the directing was poor and it seems like the showrunners dont know what theyre doing with the characterisation of anyone in danys retinue â most of these problems would be resolved if they stuck closer to the book dialogue and spent more time on danys scenes instead of wasting it on pointless filler dany has felt like an afterthought in every episode this season with the exception of episode three considering shes the iconic character of the show its a very strange decision particularly in an episode without tyrion the other iconic character â i agree that the scene felt rather rushed that is honestly one of my favorite dany moments in the whole series as well as one of the most important decisions she has made in her entire arc it felt too casual like dany was explaining to jorah how they would be having goat not horse for lunch"

"Cyril",2014-05-07,"â the conclusion from my little rewatch is this emilia is talented but many readers dont seem to like dany at all and therefore dont pay attention to either ecs performances or danys various inner turmoil from the books but not liking a character shouldnt mean dissing the talent of the actor portraying that character those are two separate things â thats a pretty big assumption as if youre trying to dismiss the opinions of those who arent dany fansâ its also an assumption that does not work if you read the threadâ there are vocal dany fans who disapprove of her acting this episode edited by cyril 07 may 2014  0116 pm"

"Gogossos",2014-05-08,"at the risk of repeating myself how else did people expect dany to react in this scene smiling gleefully when told of joffs demise outrageously flirting with daario and blowing her top at the news of the butcher king that sounds like viserys to me i guess some of you are expecting to see the mad queen but i dont think thats the interpretation emilias going for â â we know that emilia has read the books multiple times and even brings them onto the set with her in the scene from the latest episode its even possible to see exactly where shes taken influence from the book the turning away and speaking turning back turning away again is what she does in the book for example and when jorah tells her of the fall of astapor her expression is exactly the same as book dany shes totally unsurprised  its just another eroeh all over again but the problem is that the show doesnt convey this  and although emilias performance is extremely important nuances like this cant be conveyed by just acting alone would it have been hard for the showrunners to find an extra 30 seconds for this scene during which dany could explain how she feels why not reference the lahazereen women who she tried and failed to save why not mention the red waste and how she couldnt protect her people one of the reasons she doesnt march after they altered the qarth storyline why not mention her inability to save those who died thereâ â basically this its known emilia is a consummate professional and one of the few pov actors to use the books to aid her performances now tvmovie scripts dont tend to get published and read by millions so an actors performance becomes the only necessary interpretation of that character but in a series like this based on published books with multitudes of fans already in existence the actors interpretation is not the only one that exists but as far as the tv show is concerned its probably the most important one certainly the only relevant one in any case so emilia has studied the books as much as the most ardent fan in here but her interpretation of dany isnt the mad queen shes nuanced and more muted as patrickstormborn has demonstrated and i think that is jarring to some readersviewers on this board many of whom are wedded to the mad queen interpretation â i really dont see why people pick this particular episode to complain on her acting i think she conveyed a lot of emotion although subtle when getting the news from yunkai and astapor look for example how she turns away as to not show her reaction which i think conveys a lot of restrained sadness and frustration my liberation of slavers bay was maybe a tad too ironic for danys personality but i think there is tiredness and grief in the way she delivers the line â regardless i will admit that the last line with i will rule at the end was really cheesy and that she sounds like she is in a commercial for lancame or something it was a bad line and the delivery was weird but it is just one line of many i can see how a final line affects how people view the scene as a whole but i dont think it should â i totally agree emilias not wooden or one note as is the apparent popular opinion on this thread subtle nuanced yes with quite a range of complexconflicting emotions portrayed in one scene but it is a quiet scene with no music until the very end shes not angry at anyone or ecstatic about something the i will rule line is essentially the same in the books  it shouldnt come off stilted or weird or arrogant because really theres tiredness and humility in a way when she decides to stayâ"
"trgryn-strk-lnstr-mrtell",2014-05-08,"imo her lines were delivered with very little sinceritynot to sound cheesy but emilas performance did not make me believe that dany actually made the sacrifice play of giving up westeros to rule meereen it looked like emilia was having an off day so just did her lines as was expected of her â i agree with the comment about emilia generally being a consummate professionalmaybe she just didnt agree with danys decision on this course of action and so couldnt pull if off sincerely â â"
"Nami",2014-05-08,"emilia is pretty one note its quite vexing because she isnt a terrible actress i cant say its the script or the directors because other actors are doing more with less to work with take lena headey for instance she does so much when she has only a few lines both emilia and lena have a great understanding of their book counterparts but lena is incredible while emilia leaves so much to be desiredâ the scene where she decides to stay in meereen was awful no emotion regarding the butcher king no emotion about declaring herself queen this was a pivotal moment and raspberry it fell flatâ lena heady really since the first episode of season 1 she has the same acting in every scene"

"Tyrion1991",2014-05-09,"op â i dont think people are being quite fair in judging the scene and theres a bit of misunderstanding about certain scenes â â for example the bit where she says so why did you do it the point isnt to show dany as a strong or stern leader following on from the previous episode the point is to set up daarios funny i heard you like ships joke emilias uncertain delivery represents that he is challenging her and shes not quite got a handle on him as he does things unexpectedly â then the bit where she says it appears my liberation of slavers bay isnt going according to plan i actually felt she was being sarcastic here shes asked them to leave because she doesnt want to admit weakness in front of them but is comfortable saying so in front of jorah however limited an admission the sarcasm is that there is no plan notice how she turns away from her council when she learns that yunkai and astapor have fallen shes not entirely comfortable admitting that she done goofed so i think that explains her response â overall she doesnt come across as being as friendly with jorah and it turns into a speech towards the end part of the reason for that is that this is a momentous decision that has huge ramifications for the entire series the show makers have to be explicit about danys motivations for staying in meereen as they lack her internal pov and stress this as a big moment its further complicated by the fact that this decision is the final daenerys chapter and is quite dramatically delivered to her council in that scene so i think they wanted to lend a sense of moment and drama to it even if that did compromise the other objective of stressing that she is close to jorah it does turn into a speech directed at the audience over why she is staying at meereen rather than a conversation with one of her closest friendsâ â â so i dont think the problem is emilia clarkes acting at all she has some quite good moments in this scene and i quite liked when barristan describes them going to attack kings landing and she glances over at jorah with that yes lets do it this is it finally look i think its partly because in season 3 and 4 they have tried to focus on dany as a queen and this other worldly figure imo in season 1 and 2 where they show her more uncertain vulnerable and prone to bouts of anger is a lot closer to where the character actually is in the books they make her far too self controlled and aloof in the tv series i dont even think she has ever given a speech in the books and far from being high spoken n polite shes actually kinda foul mouthed n blunt its his city i want not his meager manhood i intend to drink wine of victory from the skull of the usurper edited by tyrion1991 09 may 2014  0431 am"

this season is the second half of book 3 its reasonable of me to expect that there wont be material used from the unpublished book 6â â im a long term fan of the books i bought the first one in paperback when it came out in 1997 and ive reread them many times im not nearly as knowledgeable about them as some people on this forum but i love them ive been patient the books take a long time to write â quite a while ago grrm teased us that there was more to learn about the place beyond the wall and the wildlings ive been eager to learn what this was so i wasnt pleased at all to see a 1 minute scene giving away a big chunk of that storyline when taken together with the hbo summary reveal i feel angry that the others spoiler was just given away so easily dont the loyal book fans whove waited years and years to find out what happens next deserve a bit more respect im also sad that when i read about the others in the next book ill already know what happens and that spoils my enjoyment of that part of the book im sad because grrms prose is often so beautifulwittyelegant and i want to read that and have that as my impression of the sceneâ â one of the biggest reasons people love a book is because they care about what happens to the characters so its no surprise that people care about how those book characters are portrayed onscreen i agree with you that some of the changes to the storylines give characters something to do when they have quieter times in the books books comfortably have quieter times shows cant i disagree entirely with you that characters are better with a more rounded characterization when they tone down who a character is they make them less uniqueâ â its a shame that stannis isnt as moral and brittle as he is in the book that arya never got to be scared and a nobody at harrenhal and now shes so ruthless already i know there isnt enough screen time to really portray the characters as they are in the books so i just urge interested people to read the books too i get the impression you love the action of the books and youre happy that the show has more action i love the action but i love the characters and their reasonings  nuances tooâ â your robb  bran examples dont make sense to me sorry â robb didnt have any higher stakes for me in the series than the books he married for honors sake in the books which connected nicely with stark honor and his fathers character as well as some love he married for love and lust in the series the stakes never changed because the outcome with the freys was the same only her being pregnant was different which i saw as a cliche isnt her and everyone else dying enoughâ â bran does have a moment of grown up decision making in the book he was told the rest would follow his choice and he chose not to seek refuge with any of his fathers old friends and bannermen but to go onwards and seek the three eyed crow because no matter which household hed go to hed always be a cripple later he pleaded with sam not to tell jon he was going beyond the wall â anyways dont get mad or depressed at how other people view the series compared to the books just understand that they see and feel it completely differently to you and none of us can change anything that hbo or grrm doesâ â personally ive decided to keep watching this season as im hopeful there will be no more big book spoilers then im going to pray that the next book comes out before the start of the next season otherwise i may stop watching until its out you think that will be easy to avoid all the show spoilers online and asking friends  colleagues to stop talking about it many times hearingseeing spoilers will be inevitable  â ill also have to give up reading this forum that would be sad because its given me my ice and fire fix to keep me going through the many years of waiting for new books to come out â so ill cross my fingers say a little prayer rub the buddas belly and live in delightfully deceptive hope that the next book will be out early next yearif youre a long term fan of the books you must be familiar with grrm and his repeated introductory notes to books 4  5 where he explains the last 25  30 of book 3 all of book 4 and most of book 5 happen simultaneously i dont recall but were you enraged by getting theons book 5 story in season 3 why or why not it happened correctly in the overall timeline but in book 3s season what about jojen  meera not appearing until last season are you enraged by the show not telling the story via pov storytelling again why or why not how do you think that would work in a visual medium do you think the hotu should have been shot like the books even though it would be full of spoilers and likely be prohibitively expensive we would only have heard dragons in season2 instead of seeing them seeing as you feel entitled to not being spoiled by a tv show and that hbo is somehow obligated to not go past the point of the published books both of which seem utterly outrageous and completely unrealistic to me personally you should definitely stop watching since youre clearly setting yourself up for disappointmentexcept that its not there are parts from book 4 brienne and pod have started their journey together parts from book 5 brans journey to br and even parts from book 6 stannis meets with tycho nestoris about

"Tquinn BC",2014-05-05,"this isnt a flame and this is only directed at all of you complaining about book spoilers as if someone just killed your dog â â every week i come here to share thoughts and read peoples opinions about this amazing series of books and show and for the most part its a really fun experience and im so grateful for this site but its so depressing to read the same rage and anger coming from some of the book readers about the show spoiling them â we all know book spoilers are coming at this point i for one love it its thrilling im also fully aware the show isnt the books â why are you even watching the show if being spoiled means so much to you why not just wait for the books then once you read them all after theyre eventually released go back and watch the show and compare the two â if you insist on watching the show why cant you just accept that there are two different ways to tell the same story â so far there is no butterfly effect that will massively change the overall main arcplot of the story to the point it ends differently romeo and juliet are never going to live happily ever afterâ yes many characters will probably take a different path to get to the same eventual outcome but the overall plot so far hasnt changed â example bran and jon bran and jon never met north of the wall in the books and they didnt in the show either sure jon doesnt even know in the books but the change gave bran a much needed moment of grownup decision making he doesnt have in the books â robb  talisa  we know little about robb in the books compared with the show because were never given an opportunity to be in his head in the books since hes not a pov character the shows changes gave him much higher stakes along with everyone he came in contact with  yet all the pieces still fell into place like they should â cat cersei stannis tyrion jamie and any other character you feel has been the recipient of character assassination theres so many at this point i cant even remember all of them so ill assume every character from the books that has made it into the show has someone out there who feels theyve been cad â theyre still going to die theyre still going to go where theyre supposed to and theyre still going to kill the people they should im sorry if cat is too nice for you in the show but lady stoneheart will still be in the show and she will still kill freys tyrion will still kill tywin and shea jamie will still free tyrion and leave kl cersei will still go insane but the beauty of these changes is that we dont have any one characters extreme bias clouding our judgement because we only see everything through their eyesâ â so far for me every change thats been made has been for the better because its heightened the drama for all of the characters involved and given many of them more to do and a better wellrounded characterization â grrm is an executive producer of course he knows whats going on regarding the writing for got we know hes sat down with dd and gone over the story and where it all ends up so they dont have to make shit up and guessâ â i for one am thankful that we have so many big time asoiaf fans who are writing for and in charge of this show  david dan and bryan that also understand the logistics of filmtv making so we dont end up completely off the rails like true blood might that happen sure anything is possible but i really doubt that will happen with got â and if im missing something  theres a character that should be dead on the show but isnt yes there are plenty who are dead on the show that are alive in the books but where are any of them needed to advance a plot point that cant be advanced by another secondary character  please let me know ive only read the books once so im obviously not as up to speed as most people hereâ â anyway  just my two coppers keep calm  and be happy  were so lucky to have this amazing show and that hbo loves it and is willing to keep throwing money at itâ â â i quoted this so people will read it again â and people need to this read this several times several several times"
"Cyril",2014-05-05,"i didnt like it upon watching but after further consideration ive come to love the bran turning away from jon sceneâ it gives bran a chance to show he is actively making a choice and recognizes what he has given up a choice he never really had outside of the scene with samwellâ and with samwell its not as strong youre going to be further tormented when faced with someone you know instead of an acquaintance of your acquaintanceâ he could have had safety and security with someone he lovedâ instead he is taking a risk for himself and what he believes to be the greater good â im not sure why theres so much hate towards the scene to be quite honest edited by cyril 05 may 2014  1010 pm"

"lostinwesteros",2014-05-05,"i was very upset in earlier seasons when i started seeing things from the book left out of the tv series or things added to the show that werent in the books but before long i came to realize book and show are two different things each tv season has ten only ten shows in which to tell the story that took martin a thousand pagesto tell ive got some pet peeves about changes i didnt like at all talisa eg but there are also some changes i really loved introducing theonreek so early was one that i didnt like at all at first but now i see why for the tv series it fits better to have it happen that way"
"StrollofShame",2014-05-05,"i dont mean to be snarkysounding here but it almost seems to me that some book fans want to blame anyone and everyone for the fact that the books are not finished yet it is not the fault of the show nor the fault of those who are supportive of the show nor the fault of posters here who love the show that the books are not finished that fault lies with one individual this individual will short of a miracle not complete the series before the show must conclude  many grieve rigorously over that fact but it is what it is let go accept or refuse to accept if you will but dont fault the show for the authors failures sometimes that seems to be whats happening i fear"

"DrownedSnow",2014-05-06,"what do people think has been worse the book readers enjoying watching peoples reactions to events like the red wedding or the show watchers making thing book readers since last week because something unreleased may have been spoiled and books suck or something like that just seen a lot of show watchers commenting about how books readers can suck it its a very bro attitude that was a bit odd to see and reminds you that the show draws all kinds â â â as for the spoilers im fine with it i love the books and the show whichever gives me an ending first is who i will get my ending from hopefully grrm will actually finish the series some day but until then nothing is going to ruin my desire to read them â i just think that people are too concerned over spoilers these days i started reading the books because i was spoiled about neds death before the 3rd episode even aired it didnt take anything away when i read it later and then saw it on the show i think that spoilers are largely what you make them movie trailers often spoil tons of things for us but usually not enough to lessen our enjoyment some big reveals would suck to know about but those are rare if you decide not to let it bother you then it wont bother you"
"Inv1ctus",2014-05-06,"well i think its safe to say grrm doesnt care about the readers anymore neither does he care about his magnum opus of asoiaf and if the decision for that is because he just wants to live a little travel the world meeting new people and engage in some other projects or passions he had previously in his life not just write the books day in day out for years to come who am i to deny an old man that with all that said i would still very much like to read the new books but im not gonna say screw you grrm you have to write these books and nothing else also there is a possibility that he realized he would need more books to finish up all the storylines than he previously thought that could be very demoralizing him looking down the road for the next decade i really hope that isnt the case and that he will only need seven books because then we still have a decent chance of seeing this story to the endâ"
"ToTheWolves",2014-05-06,"best thread everhope people read this"
"MidnightKiss",2014-05-06,"moet i replied to your thread because you said it wasnt a flame and it was written in an even tempered way you asked people to keep calm  and be happy â so im disappointed to come back and have you repeatedly ask me whether i was enraged by certain things hbo did thats not the language i used you are not calm or happy that i repliedâ â i dont mind if they move around the published story they need to make it work onscreen where characters cant disappear for long periods of time i personally found that book 5 had a lot of cliffhangers so i expect that when hbo dramatize those storylines onscreen they may well take some of the cliffhangerendings in book 6 and add them in that would be sensible â if youre a long term fan of the books you must be familiar with grrm and his repeated introductory notes to books 4  5 where he explains the last 25  30 of book 3 all of book 4 and most of book 5 happen simultaneously â â ouch im not the long term fan of the books i described myself as if im not familiar with these repeated introductory notes well im not familiar with what you say they are i know that book 4 and 5 mostly happen at the same time im well aware he split them and one day id love to see them published in some massive volume together but repeated introductory notes book 3 no im not familiar with that so i went and picked up my books againâ â book 3 a note on chronology grrm writes that a storm of swords does not follow the closing chapters of a clash of kings so much as overlap themâ â nothing there about books 4  5 because they hadnt been written yet â book 4 meanwhile back on the wall at the end of the book he wrote i was still writing when it dawned on me that the book had become too big to publish in a single volume and i wasnt close to finished yet to tell all of the story that i wanted to tell i was going to have to cut the book in two â book 5 a cavil on chronology he states that the book you hold in your hands is the fifth volume of a song of ice and fire the forth volume was a feast of crows however this volume does not follow that one in the traditional sense so much as run in tandem with it â these are the notes ive read i did buy them when they were first published and there have been many reprints since are there other notes in these theres no reason for me to have read them if there are grrm never wrote in my copies that book 3 was 2530 simultaneous with books 4  5 â the characters change a bit in the series the plotlines do too and im fairly ok with that i dont like it but i understand that it had to be done to bring the show to tvâ â but i was angry that they showed a significant plot spoiler from the unpublished book 6 in a storyline that was for the large majority all about the second half of book 3 after i got over my anger i was and remain deeply disappointedâ â seeing as you feel entitled to not being spoiled by a tv show and that hbo is somehow obligated to not go past the point of the published books both of which seem utterly outrageous and completely unrealistic to me personally you should definitely stop watching since youre clearly setting yourself up for disappointment â â sigh whatever happened to being calm and happy â do i want to read about book 6 before seeing it onscreen yes do i know that season 5 is likely to have bits of winds of winter in it yes do i have to make my own decision about watching season 5 yes do i feel its unreasonable to expect that season 4 which is mainly about the second half of book 3 will use unpublished book 6 material in it no do i feel that there should have been a spoiler announcement warning about season 4 might have been niceâ â i dont feel that hbo is obligated not to go past the point of the published books so much as grrm has a duty to fans to publish the books before hbo gets there oh dear that last line will probably get me into trouble this is how i honestly feel â grrm has a loyal following of book fans who have waited and enjoyed his books and sung his praises since 1996 then the books are made into tv and now there are legions of tv fans many more than the book fans the book fans cheer along with the tv fans happy for grrms success but then there comes a point when the tv fans are more important and they will get the storylines first sorry book fans your loyalty and reading of the books without which a tv series would never have existed isnt as important now its like someone turning their back on their old friends and inviting only their new friends to a partyâ â huh ive realised that in this im a stark i feel its the honourable and moral thing to do to publish the books first being a stark doesnt end up too well in the books and neither will my dreams of reading the books without seeinghearing spoilers about them â you can say im wrong you can write that my feelings are utterly outrageous and completely unrealistic but it doesnt change how i feel in this modern world i can have old fashioned values in some things i believe its the right honourable moral thing to not let down long term fans who want to read the books first â i know im in a nowin situation im aware that right now theres little chance of the next book coming before the next season which is bound to have significant spoilers i know that i can either watch the show and have my book enjoyment spoiled or not watch it and end up hearingreading spoilers anyways the show is in all the national newspapers there are plenty of clips and trailers to avoid so its not just asking people not to tell me â so what im choosing is to exist in a little bubble of self delusionto hope that the next book might come out just before the next season on tv that way i dont have to face that my enjoyment of the next book is going to be spoiled one way or another it already has been with the reveal of the others â ill float off now in that little bubble and remember your original words encouraging everyone to be calm and happy i wish the same for you be calm and happy and enjoy your day"
"Chebyshov",2014-05-06,"well i think its safe to say grrm doesnt care about the readers anymore neither does he care about his magnum opus of asoiaf â i dont think its safe to say that the man has writers block im sure he doesnt love being in this situation either but weve all known since affc came out that hes struggling to finish this off the timejump would have helped imo but we are where we are i think saying things like grrm doesnt care isnt helpful and isnt accurate â that being said i agree with the ops sentiments â people are upset that book spoilers are coming this season which seems soon some werent expecting spoilers until season 7 but im of the mind that twow will not be released before next season and given where some characters bran brienne are in their arc we were going to be getting spoilers next season anyway the way i see it well likely have the same amount of book content in our hands this time next year so what difference does it make if the spoilers start in season 4 â i think the main thing is that some people were in denial about twows release date note when an editor says 2015â at the earliest you can probably assume you wont have it by april im just happy to see how this great great series concludesthe medium is less important to me"

"MidnightKiss",2014-05-06,"â â people are upset that book spoilers are coming this season which seems soon some werent expecting spoilers until season 7 but im of the mind that twow will not be released before next season and given where some characters bran brienne are in their arc we were going to be getting spoilers next season anyway the way i see it well likely have the same amount of book content in our hands this time next year so what difference does it make if the spoilers start in season 4 â the difference is that if id known there would be spoilers in season 4 i could have chosen not to watch it as you say we were going to be getting spoilers in the next season so i expected i would have to make a choice about whether to watch season 5 and get spoilers i didnt get that choice for season 4 â i know the twow publication date is 2015 at the earliest that leaves the tiny sliver of hope that it could be published before the next season or that further sample chapters will be released that contain what would be the twow show spoilers if there is no hope that it could be published before the next season then it would be kinder for grrm to let fans know than leave them in false hope"

"Sigrunn",2014-05-06,"why are you even watching the show if being spoiled means so much to you why not just wait for the books then once you read them all after theyre eventually released go back and watch the show and compare the two â there is no way of avoiding spoilers unless you mean to build a bunker say nobody cares that the nights king is alive and was shown in the show before he appeared in the books however if a character of great importance dany arya dies the media will be filled with it many heard of the red wedding and they never saw the show"

"Kaspiro",2014-05-04,"in the books sandor is left to die after being wounded at a tavern fight one which happened without any tangible consequences for him in the books already i imagine that their are two ways sandors storyline could continue now he does not die at all which i find possible but unlikely given it completely eliminates sandors redemption or that the show creates a new death for him akin to rakharos new death in the red waste thinking of potential new deaths for sandor i cant help remembering that sandor is currently journeying to ransom arya to lysa arryn in the eyrie though he definitely wont be making this transaction to get to the eyrie he would have to travel through the mountains of the moon now im sure many in the showonly audience still recall the unique and somewhat comical mountain clans from seasons 1 and 2 i dont think at this point reintroducing them would be particularly difficult so my prediction is sandor and arya travel through the mountains of the moon and meet with shagga and his stone crows or some other clan chief and clan sandor is unable or unwilling to negotiate with them and wins the fight against them but is wounded arya leaves him to die as before and the story continues on as normal arya could easily travel to some vale town perhaps gulltown even to get on a ship to braavos and sandor could plausibly make his way to the quiet isle from the vale it would be a fairly good opportunity to bring some wellliked characters im sure more than a few people wouldnt be adverse to seeing shagga again and stay consistent with the storyline thoughtsâ"
"Jennelyn",2014-05-04,"since we see arya stabbing the hound in the preview for the next episode im guessing she is the one responsible for his eventually fatal wound its hard to say from 1 second of footage but it would be an elegant way for them to part â your theory is interesting but im doubtful that they will spend so much time on that storyline whatever happens my guess is that the hounds days are numbered and he wont appear on many more episodes this season"

"King Tommen",2014-05-04,"i dont think arya does any damage at all with that poke it looks like she ends up on her ass as a result the hounds wound will come from a fight near the end of the season im doubtful its with any of the hill tribes though because none of them have been announced as returning â one interesting development is that briennepod and aryahound are on a collision course going to the vale for the end of the season they may or may not actually meet up but both duos will certainly be in the same vicinity around the same time"
"Obebb",2014-05-04,"i like ops theory about the vale it seems way more likely for the show to stick with what the audience already knows rather than introducing a whole new place the quiet isle and i think a battle with the hound vs mountain clans could be very exciting id love to see shagga againâ â although having him kill the hound would probably turn everyone in the fandom against himâ â so a random clansman would be better id like that"
"Jennelyn",2014-05-04,"youre probably right that arya doesnt actually stab the hound im sure they just want to make folks wonder by what they showed in the preview if they do indeed reach the eyrie it makes sense that hes wounded there somehow however i dont think arya wounding the hound is a stupid theory he is on her list after all i dont care how buddy buddy theyve been"

"Electric Wizard",2014-05-05,"hahahahaha brilliantpersonally i think he might get badly wounded saving arya in a fight somewhere wrap it up with a nice heartwarming confirmation of the lovely relationship the two of them have i dunno â i think thats the most likely option with arya doing the deed herself a somewhat distant second not sure who hell be fighting though the tribesmen do seem an option as others have said that said arya does have to choose to leave him to die unless they change that too her stabbing the hound herself would remove the need a tricky farewell conversation â i was thinking that the hound would get into a fight at the bloody gate which basically seems to have replaced the gates of the moon on the show but on sansa and littlefingers walkthrough there were dozens of guys there including cliff archersâ i cant imagine the hound being dumb enough to start a fight there and if he did i have no idea how he could possibly get away particularly as this stuff was filmed in iceland where there are no horses allowed â is that true about the horses do you just mean in terms of filming or budgeting or something i recall seeing some dead horses at the fist of the first men not sure about any live ones though â where do they film the haunted forest scenes i think a trailer showed some of stannis men on horseback it would be pretty lame if there was no major mounted charge as part of the assault i guess that might be ireland or somewhere"
"Colonel Green",2014-05-05,"is that true about the horses do you just mean in terms of filming or budgeting or something i recall seeing some dead horses at the fist of the first men not sure about any live ones though iceland doesnt allow the importation of foreign horses because of the health of their native breed a rather smallish type that are not the kind the show has been using for filming thus far â the haunted forest stuff is filmed on sets in ireland"
"Le Cygne",2014-05-05,"thought this was interesting seeing it again he only hit her in the books to save her life i was wondering why they did that â in the riverlands sandor clegane rory mccann knows that arya maise williams dreams of killing him but when he finds her practicing her needlework he gives her a lesson in what she needs to survive the slap sandor lays across aryas face as she pushes needle helplessly up against his mail is less a way to put her in her place and more a means of marking her as an equal like bronn did with jaime the blow is less of contempt and more a sign sandor thinks arya can be educated â httpwwwwashingtofirstofhers"

"Widows_Blood",2014-04-29,"many episode titles have had double meanings the obvious one for this title is tommen i cant really think of a secondary one  first i thought it was a reference to balon and that he would die in this episode but according to the wiki he is the ninth balon to be king of the iron islands it cant be euron either in case theyd decide to skip the whole kingsmoot and just introduce and crown him in the same episode as balon dies since he is the third euron â if balon dies in this episode it could be a reference to theon  someone might make an offhand remark that if theon wasnt disinherited he would have been the first of his name but that seems a bit contrived â daenerys is probably the first daenerys to rule meereen but thats not his name first of his name is obviously karl tanner lord of crasters keep killer of daughter fuckers assassin of gin alley speaker to skulls hater of ballsack lookers and all things rast â his words are fuck em till there deadâ"

"~DarkHorse~",2014-04-29,"â on another thread someone suggested that the nw member they could be planning to substitute into the bowen marsh role is pyp that hadnt occurred to me before but it actually would make a lot of sense pyp is not a longtime nw vet like marsh was but hes a steward who you could certainly see promoted into a bigger role by jon once he becomes lc pyp being a friend of jon who slowly starts to disagree with his opinions would make for a more dramatic journey and the ultimate betrayal would be more emotionalâ if they were looking to use an existing character who the audience knows and is sympathetic to as opposed to bringing in an unknown guy who supposedly was hanging around the background all along then i wouldnt mind it â i have no idea what they have in store for locke but if they are trying to make him the one who ultimately turns on jon it completely alters that entire arc and im not sure if thats what theyre looking to do locke is an undercover evil spy looking for an opportunity to take out all the living starks not a supposed confidant who loses faith in jons leadership and eventually feels like killing him is the only way to save the nw â i really like the idea of pyp being involved in the assassination â it makes for more drama and tragedy â locke doing it turns it into a bolton plot rather than a representation of corruption within the nw and bowen is a background character"

"SM4e",2014-05-01,"i disagree ive always that felt asos had multiple endings and never thought of only cat as the definitive one just because it occurred last in fact it was the weakest ending to me because i watched the show before reading the books and i already knew lf was bad business thanks to the heavyhanded portrayal of the character on the show the snow winterfell scene was the highlight of the chapter and i thought tywins death the reveal of lady stoneheart and arya leaving westeros were more engaging endings â im not saying the reveal doesnt belong in the finale im only saying i would understand if they revealed it earlier and im expecting them to based on the recap theres also plenty of explosiveness in the finale without the reveal so the interviews are no confirmation i pretty much felt it rounded up act i of the saga the war of the 5 kings has ended 3 hands of the king have passed away but the conspirator is still alive and has not even reached his peak of manipulation in sansas last chapter we get to know who is responsible for all the mess that has happened i do really hope this will be the second last scene then cut to lady stoneheart it just looks amazing on the paper imho â dragonstone and dreadfort in one episode  that was my biggest dream the whole time and with ep 6 it comes trueâ  â we had that scenario in 4x02"

"Newstar",2014-05-02,"â this statement makes me feel like they are our own little lab rats â much of my enjoyment of the show derives from watching the unsullied lose their shit its even more delicious though when the show spoils things and the book readers lose their shit exhibit a white walkers sequence at the end of 4x04 i cant wait until the show hits unpublished book territory and were all unsullied for all intents and purposes and freaking out with the rest of them â â â im gona have to reread the booksthe show really convinced me joffery killed roberts basterds it tied in too perfectly i suppose with the rest of the scenesbut i thought show did indicate strongly that cerseiâ was responsible for tyrion attack during blackwater â the show reveals for both the bastards and the attempt on joffreys life played out almost exactly the same tyrion initially believed cersei was responsible and angled for some sort of confession from cersei tyrion seemed to come to the conclusion from cerseis reaction to his accusation that joffrey and not cersei was responsible cersei didnt deny it and in the case of the bastards she says that joffrey did what needed to be done and tyrion concluded that he was correct both times it seemed implied that joffrey was responsible and that cersei was not although i suppose its sufficiently ambiguous that cersei is stringing tyrion along and letting him believe whatever he wants for show purposes though i think the more likely explanation is that the show has resolved those questions so that the viewers can move on even if the answers the show has given are different from the books where cersei was responsible for the bastards and we still dont know who was responsible for the murder attempt at blackwater â i suspected in the books that it was littlefinger who was behind the attempt on tyrions life at blackwater cersei never alludes to it in her povs for all that she frets about tyrion and there is that vale connection ser mandon moore is from the vale and was brought to kl by jon arryn â â â did the actor thatâ plays sam say no cold hands in the show or just that there would be no cold hands in his story line â theres this quote from brans actor in advance of season 4 â i was really disappointed because he was the cool conspiracy one in this storyline he says it would have been so much fun to have coldhands im sure there will probably be a bigger wider reasons because its such a crucial important character to suddenly not include him seems a bit strange hempsteadwright continues i think anything important wont be left out without good reason so for instance coldhands i suspect  or hope rather  that hes been left out because hes going to come into play in a more important way later but certainly all the important bits will definitely be there and i look forward to seeing them â kind of cagey but it sounds like brans actor is hopeful at the least that coldhands will be introduced later on and is being saved the change from suspecting to hoping could mean that isaac hempsteadwright knows that coldhands will come into play and changed it to hope to avoid giving anything away or changed it from suspecting to hoping because he realized that it sounded like he was spoiling the audience when in fact he was just expressing his personal hopes it could be read either way unfortunately â the infamous john bradley quote was from a wsj live interview where he was asked if there was something samrelated from the books that he missed because it was cut from the show â uhi would have liked coldhands if at all possible i think a lot of people thought that when sam kills the white walker people thought that was going to be coldhands but coldhands doesnt really play a part in this show and there are some things that people will be expecting that will be in this series in this season season 4 that may not happen or if they do happen wont happen until future series seasons the books and the show are becoming so separate that you cant really secondguess anything really â so it could go either way i didnt personally see the quote as ruling out coldhands forever but it does seem to rule out coldhands for season 4 edited by newstar 03 may 2014  1226 am"
