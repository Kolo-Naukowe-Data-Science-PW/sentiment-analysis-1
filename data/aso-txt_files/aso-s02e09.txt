1	Ran	2012-04-29	Non-spoiler discussion of the show goes here, for those who've not read the books or those who have but are happy to not actually reference them at all in discussion, taking each episode as it comes.
This topic should open automatically when the show begins airing.

3	justashadow	2012-05-28	I'm definitely speechless.....just a brilliant episode from beginning to end!

4	FirelordSylar22	2012-05-28	Pretty much what they said. Perfect from start to finish.
5	The Last Reyne	2012-05-28	Yeah, one of those episodes that doesn't really need discussing. Just sit back and savor.
6	justashadow	2012-05-28	I guess that happens when GRRM writes the episode.
7	Aripyanfar	2012-05-28	The Wildfire explosion was COMPLETELY spectacular... but afterwards, with the men screaming from over the water, it was gutwrenching listening.  Tyrion's rallying speech was awesome.  The battle... and yet, even with all the battle scenes, somehow I got caught up with the scenes in the women's quarter more.  My brain kind of got that they'd retreated to a tower room for safety and were tensely awaiting the outcome, but as the episode unfolded my stomach finally got the crawling horror of their situation.  A Stannis win, no matter how I wanted Joffrey to be toppled, meant almost certain gang rape for all the women.  Scarred for life, possibly physically disfigured, possibly a lingering slow death from rape or injury.  So they were awaiting the outcome of the battle, to know when to commit mass suicide, by their own hand or by Ilyn Payne's.  Or not.  What a horrific wait.
8	chico	2012-05-29	Definitely the best episode so far this season...
Some things I'm looking forward to finding out:
- Is Tyrion just stunned/knocked-out?  I was SO fearful as I saw the scar show on his face that his head had just been sliced in half (especially given all the other body chopping we saw).
- Was Stannis being pulled back by his own men or was he being captured?  It seemed like he was just being pulled away because it was time to retreat.
- Will Sansa go with the Hound?  I know she's been crazy-dutiful so far, but here's her chance!
That wildfire explosion is easily the 2nd best scene so far (behind Dany rising with her dragons from the fire).  Wow.
9	Svetopolk	2012-05-30	I was SO fearful as I saw the scar show on his face that his head had just been sliced in half (especially given all the other body chopping we saw).Haha, same here! I was so relieved it was only a flesh wound:)
10	spcphd	2012-05-30	I'm surprised none of the discussion in here mentions Dog of the King's Guard. His character made a dramatic and enigmatic turn in this last episode; can anyone explain it, either with or without the books? Why the conflict with the mercenaries and betrayal of the king? Why fight at first only to give up? Why take Sansa to the Starks?
11	Ser Steven	2012-05-30	I'm surprised none of the discussion in here mentions Dog of the King's Guard. His character made a dramatic and enigmatic turn in this last episode; can anyone explain it, either with or without the books? Why the conflict with the mercenaries and betrayal of the king? Why fight at first only to give up? Why take Sansa to the Starks?Remember back to the first Season when Littlefinger tells Sansa the story of the Hound's childhood, and then remember what happened right before he left the battlefield and you will have your answer.
12	She-Ra	2012-05-31	Love. Love. Love. Love this episode. I've probably watched it ten times now.
Does anyone have a map showing where Bronn was standing when he shot the arrow after Tyrion's signal? It looks like he's across from Tyrion and then turns around and shoots. So exactly where are the ships coming in?

14	Peras	2012-06-02	Actually, now that you mention it, Bronn's position is quite a mystery. He really seems to be across the river, but that cannot be. Maybe they made up some small island in the bay

15	Your Grace took the Black	2012-08-09	Best episode in Season 2! Would you agree? I came to appreciate the episode more when I knew that this episode was written by George R.R. Martin, not that I'm not satisfied with the other major writers of this show, every episode is a massive production, but GRRM made justice to this episode more than the audience could have imagine! /cheers.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cheers:' />

17	Ran	2012-05-27	What'd you think?
18	livewyre	2012-05-27	OMG it was perfect. Best episode of the series.
19	Howdyphillip	2012-05-27	I don't know where they found this hack of a writer, but he RUINED it... The guy they got must have known NOTHING of Westeros...
Just kidding... That was absolutely brilliant. Perfect television. I gave it a 10
20	FirelordSylar22	2012-05-27	One of the best episodes of any series ever.
21	Ser Hippie	2012-05-27	One of the best hours of TV I've ever seen. Incredibly gripping, which is even more impressive given that I already knew what would happen.
22	Ran	2012-05-27	That, ladies and gentlemen, is how you write the show. Changes? Yes. Characters remaining within the paradigm of what the showrunners have defined (Cersei and Sandor, most notably)? Yep. But it all actually clicks together.
My biggest beefs: I wish they didn't have to Hollywoodize Stannis and have him swinging his sword in the forefront, but okay, you want to give him an action moment, I guess. And I wish someone had been shouting, "Renly!" and you'd see the guys in Renly's kit still throwing down their swords or turning on their own.
But... uh. Those complaints, they are minor.
23	Zios	2012-05-27	Enjoyed it, it was rushed and the Cersei scenes broke the tempo, but overall it was great.
24	salt	2012-05-27	I don't know where they found this hack of a writer, but he RUINED it... The guy they got must have known NOTHING of Westeros...You know nothing.  I have the feelings we'll be seeing much more from this up and coming Greg R.R. Morton fella.
25	FirelordSylar22	2012-05-27	The scene with the wildfyre was fucking insane. That looked like something out of a huge epic movie.
26	Laohu	2012-05-27	How could this episode earn a rating of anything other than a 10. I mean, really.. GRRM = BA Mofo.
27	Lord Belmore	2012-05-27	I have chills, and it's not just from my A/C. 10.
Only complaints are that the end felt a little rushed, Tyrion's injury scene just felt awkward, and I agree that someone(s) shouting "Renly" would have been nice.
But having Cersei with Tommen on the Iron Throne was an inspired scene, and the writing was absolutely superb throughout. Wonderful, wonderful television.
28	GOTgirl	2012-05-27	Phenomenal episode!!!   If GRRM was already finished writing the Book Series I would be campaigning for him to be writing each and every episode!  Now that is how a real writer does it!

29	Died a Hero	2012-05-27	I gave this episode a 10 because for some reason, the wretched thing wont go to 11.
Let's see, the Rain's of Castamere, the Blackwater set afire in a huge green glow, Davos and his son being blown from their ship, Stannis yelling to stand and fight while his men forced him to retreat, Cersei acting like the psycho she is and almost poisoning Tommen, the Hound's face when the guy on fire rushed him, Tyrion's speech and his "Oh, fuck me" and the sword slash from hell, Tywin's troops riding in while his youngest son blacks out, oh and did I mention the fucking Rain's of Castmere?  
No song from the little bird, no chain, and guess what? No worries. This was a fucking perfect adaptation to the scene I had in my mind when reading ACOK years ago, and no purist will take that away from me.

30	TheHedgeWizard	2012-05-27	Best episode of the season no doubt. one of the best episodes of the series. definitely in the top 3.
31	Eddward Stark	2012-05-27	That was just AWESOME!  
I was initially bummed about the lack of a giant chain, but Tyrion had so many other brilliant moments, that it made up for it.  The Hound was great.
32	NickSnow	2012-05-27	WOW!!! That was absolutely fantastic. I had no issues with this episode at all. It was perfect. 
I think that GRRM just redeemed this season for me.
33	boojam	2012-05-27	Enjoyed it, it was rushed and the Cersei scenes broke the tempo, but overall it was great.Would have kept Cersei's scenes, but shortened them.Loved the closing credits.A 10 for sure.
34	NickSnow	2012-05-27	WOW!!! That was absolutely fantastic. I had no issues with this episode at all. It was perfect. 
I think that GRRM just redeemed this season for me.
35	Mack Kilimaro	2012-05-27	10/10. I don't even know what else to say right now. That far exceeded my expectations of what they'd be able to pull off for that battle. Amazing.
36	Trebla	2012-05-27	I don't know where they found this hack of a writer, but he RUINED it... The guy they got must have known NOTHING of Westeros..Just kidding... That was absolutely brilliant. Perfect television. I gave it a 10I had visions of huge fan hate mail being directed at D & D after the episode because of no chain, not enough ship, Stannis leading from the front, etc."Whoever wrote this episode, clearly has never read George RR Martin!!"Next scene has Benioff on the phone, "And another thing, Martin, I'm stopping payment on the check! Fuck me? Read my lips, FUCK YOU!" **Shamelessly ripped off from Back to School
37	MegasAV	2012-05-27	Very enjoyable episode I rated an 8, only a few points of contention, the Sandor/Sansa scene clearly lacked the power of the book with Sandor putting a blade to her throat and threatening to kill her for his song, I thought the shows version was clearly not as good.  Also I really dislike how incompetent they made Davos and Stannis out to be as battle commanders in the way in which Tyrion implemented the wildfire attack.
I mean a single ship unsurrounded would raise no red flags with a seasoned commander like Stannis, but I know to some extent I am nitpicking the effect were great, and given what type of budget they were working with, I really felt they did a tremendous job.
38	Risha	2012-05-27	Gotta watch it again...
39	ServantOnIce	2012-05-27	That was a good an episode of television as I have ever seen. I have it up there with
	Spoiler 
Dexter's "Rita's death" episode,

Law and Order Criminal Intent "Central Park Jogger" episode, and so many other perfect episodes of television.

41	NedFlanderStark	2012-05-27	10.  Favorite episode of the series, just nailed it.  Stannis being the first up the ladder and looking like a badass was awesome.
42	MMOWarrior	2012-05-27	Rains of Castsmere during the credits made me cry...
43	WinterWarrior	2012-05-27	Certainly a 10, the best episode so far. I loved the Rains of Castamere playing during the credits at the end and Tywin coming into the throne room....
It was adapted for TV but still true to the book. Perfect. I loved it. Will watch it again at 10pm.
And it was great to see Roy Dotrice again. San/San was fine, that story will continue later. I am confident now that the important story lines of Book 3 will be preserved in Seasons 3 and 4.
Love ya GRRM!

50	Unsullier	2012-05-27	Unsure of this episode.  I need to watch it again.
When I read the book, I envisioned more fire, shore to shore, even fire creeping up the wall.  I was hoping for heat to come through my television...
Stannis as the first one up the ladder?  Not buying it.
Tyrion attacking Stannis' troops started out reeking of awesomeness, but I hope you didn't blink your eyes.  In two seconds they were out the gate and the turtle was flipped and on fire.  Poor editing, poor engineering.
The Hound was awesome.  I'm curious if Sansa will go with him and doppelgang Arya's story?
Davos shitting his pants once he realized what was going on was effen perfect.  
As usual, Varys is worth his weight in gold.
That is all for now.
51	_Oberyn_	2012-05-27	10. Yes writing maters, and everyone who keeps making excuses for bad writing, eg budget/time can have a nice cup of stfu now.
52	Ran	2012-05-27	ServantOnIce,
"Baelor" was written by D&D. Credit where credit is due. They did a great job on that episode. And having Ned point Arya out to Yoren was inspired.
George wrote "The Pointy End" last season.
53	StannisWins	2012-05-27	Unsure of this episode.  I need to watch it again.When I read the book, I envisioned more fire, shore to shore, even fire creeping up the wall.  I was hoping for heat to come through my television...Stannis as the first one up the ladder?  Not buying it.I legitimately feel sorry for you.
54	FirelordSylar22	2012-05-27	People better be thanking David and Dan who went to HBO and begged for the extra time and money to film this battle.
55	genegirl	2012-05-27	Definitely one of the top episodes of both Seasons.  Thank you HBO for no being cheap and giving the viewers an epic battle.
56	pntrlqst	2012-05-27	That Bronn/Sandor scene did nothing for me. 9/10. Best this season.

58	rmholt	2012-05-27	GRRM dialed it to 11.
59	akajea	2012-05-27	10/10. SanSan was a bit disappointing. Cersei was fucking AMAZING!
60	Dornish Hen	2012-05-27	Wow!!!!  A 10!!!!   A sit on the edge of your seat episode!!  
I loved the changes the writers made.  It made the episode flow very well. the wildfire looked awesome on the screen.
I also loved how the camera shot The Hound through the heat waves of the candle. 
 Great foreshadowing for episode three!

As usual, Varys is worth his weight in gold.That is all for now.I felt exactly the same way about Stannis going first up the ladder with no protection. The reason kings and generals didn't lead their armies from the front, historically, is because it generally turned out disastrously. For every Leonidas who dies heroically, there's a Brasidas who dies fighting over a stupid city like Amphipolis.But I think part of that is not really knowing WTF he was doing. Maybe I missed something. Did that battlement lead directly to the holdfast or was there some other directly strategic value there?The wildfire is where I disagree with you. That one bright blooming flower of green, with thousands of splinters spraying in every direction, was fantastic. I loved the reaction shot of the Hound, Tyrion and Joffrey with their faces bathed in green light. If GoT was gonna shortchange us on wildfire, that one scene was worth it.I'm also wondering if the show takes another detour and Davos is dead. The way it all happened, I would not be surprised.
63	rmholt	2012-05-27	10/10. SanSan was a bit disappointing. Cersei was fucking AMAZING!10/10. SanSan was a bit disappointing. Cersei was fucking AMAZING!I liked the San/San and would happily have tossed the whole book over the side for her to go with him.Cersei makes a great moody drunk.Marie
64	King Rickon	2012-05-27	Good god was that fun.  I'm so amped I want to start swinging a sword and storming a castle!  Minor thing, I think some scenes (The Cersie once, mainly) needed a bit of music in the background (yeah, I notice that stuff), but that was spot-on.  The tone was right, the tension was right and Bronn was hysterical as always.
65	Dolorous Nick	2012-05-27	Ten out of ten for me.
Great acting by all, but Rory McCann in particular was absolutely spot on.  The Hound went from an absolute terror (I counted two men cleaved in half) to absolutely terrified in a way that was very believable.  I like the palpable tension between him and Bronn before the battle.
I've seen plenty of epic battle scenes in plenty of films by now.  What separates the great ones (Braveheart, LOTR, Saving Private Ryan) from the mediocre ones (Kingdom of Heaven, Troy) are the ramifications, the emotional investment that the viewer has in the outcome.  The scenes involving soldiers from both sides leading up to the battle, the dialogue on the battlements between Joffrey, Tyrion, Lancel, and the Hound, the silent fear of the women and children confined below, away from the fighting, Cersei's description of the inevitable rape/murder that the women would face if Stannis were to breach the gates, all of this made me care about The Battle of the Blackwater.
A tip of the hat to everybody involved in this episode.  Fantastic hour of television.
66	Stargaryen	2012-05-27	Sansa: I'll pray for your safety
Tyrion: You will?
Sansa: Just as I do for Joffrey...
OUCH!
Loved the episode, obviously some small deviations but very well done. 
Having watched the Sandor Sansa scene, I don't get why she would choose not to go with a him when he is not drunk, scary, and offers to take her home...
But that's minor I guess.
I really want to hear all of the Rains of Castamere at one time now!
67	Dolorous Nick	2012-05-27	Oh yeah, nice touch in adding The Rains of Castamere to the final credits.  Nice little reward to fans of the books as well as the series.  Much appreciated.
68	Menos Grande	2012-05-27	10!
It was awesome Tyrion's brightest moments .. a petty he'll never be as good as this again >(! Varys X Tyrion /o\ SansaX Cersei! Cersei and Tommen /o\! All was awesome! The only thing i realy missed was Clegane kissing Sansa.

81	zippypoodle	2012-05-27	Pretty good episode, although I'm not really that into graphic fight scenes as much as most fantasy fans though.
82	saucyjak	2012-05-27	Good episode, But, I just do not see how everyone is rating it so high. The battle of Blackwater wasn't anything like the book and was dumbed down and cheesy. I love the show, But the battle was terrible. With CGI nowadays, no excuse for not following the book more closely. I think it looked like a B movie battle actually. Dark and cheaply made. My opinion.
83	zippypoodle	2012-05-27	That, ladies and gentlemen, is how you write the show. Changes? Yes.

Those complaints, they are minor.I actually agree with a complaint from Ran for once /eek.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':eek:' />I'm a little surprised Martin chose to have Stannis in the front of the battle--he always seemed more like a lead from behind where the leader can actually be of use kind of guy. Robert is the Baratheon who'd storm the walls personally, not Stannis.
84	ChristophUL	2012-05-27	I enjoyed it!  I like the cliff hanger with Sansa for those who did not read the book.  I thought it was a nice touch to add Stannis/Tywin to the fighting.  It gave us a little of everything, I was quite impressed.
85	zippypoodle	2012-05-27	I legitimately feel sorry for you.I agree.Having said that, remember that feeling. That's how I've felt all along for those people who have been rating episodes this season below 7 when they have all been 8 or better. And that's a fact.
86	FirelordSylar22	2012-05-27	Good episode, But, I just do not see how everyone is rating it so high. The battle of Blackwater wasn't anything like the book and was dumbed down and cheesy.

My opinion.Can't believe this has to constantly be repeated. BUDGET RESTRAINTS!!Contrary to your belief, CGI cost money, good CGI cost a lost of money. David and Dan had to beg and plead with HBO for extra money to film what they did film, would the chain have been cool to see, yea, but it didn't matter, the result was the same. The battle was far from dumb and cheesy and far from me "cheaply made". Nothing about this show is cheaply made

If he loves the Lannisters and the Starks are doomed, I will be heartbroken when all is said and done.I gave the episode a 9 -- just because too much Cersei was there. She talks too much.That wildfire scene was great!
88	saucyjak	2012-05-27	If I remember correctly Tyrion was injured fighting on a half sunken galley. Killed his horse, ended up on a the ship, bodies coming in from the river. There was a wall of fire he looked into...etc..etc I just can't see how anyone who read the book thinking it was done even 5% of of the quality of what was in the book. I realize there are budget contraints, but I just do not understand all the accolades.
89	ChristophUL	2012-05-27	Can't believe this has to constantly be repeated. BUDGET RESTRAINTS!!Contrary to your belief, CGI cost money, good CGI cost a lost of money. David and Dan had to beg and plead with HBO for extra money to film what they did film, would the chain have been cool to see, yea, but it didn't matter, the result was the same. The battle was far from dumb and cheesy and far from me "cheaply made". Nothing about this show is cheaply madeGreat points.  I think some truly believed Stannis would have 20,000 extras with him along with 200 ships.  Some people will never be satisfied!

91	saucyjak	2012-05-27	Let me Clarify, I LOVE the show and the books, Just dissapointed with the battle scenes. Been waiting for this episode and my expectations were too high I guess.
92	Lord Godric	2012-05-27	The absolute best episode of the 19 we have so far!  No one can write this world like Martin.  Cersei was perfection in this episode, I wish we saw her like that more often.  Fearless and unhinged yet willing to do the necessary evils to protect her son.  The Hound was perfect.  I was never a fan of him in the books, but he was good in this episode.  Tyrion was fantastic.  Funny and bold and everything he needed to be.  And that last scene where Loras storms into the room followed by Tywin literally gave me chills.
93	_Oberyn_	2012-05-27	Gosh, I hope not. If he loves the Lannisters and the Starks are doomed, I will be heartbroken when all is said and done.There is no Lannisters vs Starks

94	Risha	2012-05-27	I'm a little surprised Martin chose to have Stannis in the front of the battle--he always seemed more like a lead from behind where the leader can actually be of use kind of guy. Robert is the Baratheon who'd storm the walls personally, not Stannis.This. Perhaps not his choice, though? there was tons of foreshadowing in tonight's episode! tommen (and cersei) on the throne. the interaction between tyrion and sansa. and i think two different people told sansa "if you marry joffrey."Loved this!! Varys speaking (apparently truthfully and with feeling) to Tyrion concerning the rise of magic, things he's seen/heard outside of Westeros. Makes me wonder what else is in store for everyone's favorite Halfman. The poison in Cersei's hand: "I know what it will do!" Tyrion: "You can't f*ck your way out of everything." Shea: "It has worked so far."So many great moments from the book: Shea's "Lion."  Sansa's realization that the Hound is no one to fear despite his looks. The Hound's fear on the strand. Joffrey's face watching the wildfire. The inexplicable actions of a Kingsguard Knight slashing Tyrion's face and Pod's courage. "The Rains of Castamere" at the end. It was like a love song to readers from GRRM. Thank you, Mr. Martin!
95	justashadow	2012-05-27	IMO, best episode of the season by far!

96	LuisDantas	2012-05-27	I only wish we had the Ghost of Renly, some evidence of the Tyrell's presence, and a bit less effort to lend Stannis the appearance of respectability.
That said, it is still a solid 9.
97	Robin Of House Hill	2012-05-27	10.  But, I'm probably the only one who didn't appreciate the Rains of Castamere during the credits.
98	zippypoodle	2012-05-27	Sansa's realization that the Hound is no one to fear despite his looks. The Hound's fear on the strand.I've always seen the Hound's story as kind of a parallel to Jaime's. Both men have defined themselves essentially by one characteristic--and then both have that self-image ripped away from them (Jaime is no longer a fearsome warrior, thr Hound no longer a fearless one). It's where they go from the point that they realize they have to redefine themselves where they diverge. Jaime becomes something better, the Hound something less.
99	redditdedditrevolver	2012-05-27	I only wish we had the Ghost of Renly, some evidence of the Tyrell's presence, and a bit less effort to lend Stannis the appearance of respectability.That said, it is still a solid 9.Loras is wearing renlys armor in the last scene.
100	Merc	2012-05-27	Honestly, having read the books, I can understand the disappointment of some but realistically there is no way to turn GRRM's story into a viable series without massive changes by the scriptwriters.  I think they have done a phenomenal job, personally, and don't envy them their task.  I think the fact that people that are completely unfamiliar with the books can get involved with this story is testament to the skill f the directors and writers.  Great fun and wonderful acting.  Not perfect but good lord, how could it be?  So sad it all ends next wek and months till it starts again.
101	Kashmir	2012-05-27	The wildfire explosion was definitely my favorite part. That looked AMAZING.
102	2minichinz	2012-05-27	A skillful compaction of a complex and intense event. Cersei truly shone in her scenes. I admit that I was a tad disappointed by the omission of Tyrion's brilliant strategies, but I am not going to diss the Master.  God, I love this show almost as much as I love the books.

103	greywindsrage	2012-05-27	I like the fact that they have Stannis leading by example. Makes me love the character even more. The explosion of wildfire was magnificent. The tension leading up to battle. The Rains of Castamere. Bronn and The Hound in action. Cersei being the evil queen b that she is. Great episode.

110	Corvinus	2012-05-27	That, ladies and gentlemen, is how you write the show. Changes? Yes. Characters remaining within the paradigm of what the showrunners have defined (Cersei and Sandor, most notably)? Yep. But it all actually clicks together.My biggest beefs: I wish they didn't have to Hollywoodize Stannis and have him swinging his sword in the forefront, but okay, you want to give him an action moment, I guess. And I wish someone had been shouting, "Renly!" and you'd see the guys in Renly's kit still throwing down their swords or turning on their own.But... uh. Those complaints, they are minor.Regarding Hollywoodizing Stannis and other major characters in any movie/show, it's the fact that they rarely given them helmets. Stannis could have had his head crushed.But this episode: 10 10 10 10 10, 10 on everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
111	zippypoodle	2012-05-27	Drug-addled lunatics, perhaps?  Grumkins?  Snarks?  /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />I considered voting 1 and coming up with a list of nine inconsequential changes from the novels to "justify" my vote just to make a point. But I ended up not bothering.

Reviews are stupendous, ratings are stupendous.  Their goal is to make great television, and they have wholly succeeded!10/10
113	Tewks44	2012-05-27	Although Tywin's charge felt a bit rushed, that overall scene with Cersei telling the story of the lion cubs while Tywin's host was riding into battle was chillingly good.  I kind of wish they put more emphasis on the mass defections that occurred when everyone thought it was Renly riding into battle, but hey, that was still probably one of the best things I've seen on T.V.
10/10
EDIT: and the hound's exit was AWESOME.  When he said "fuck the kingsgaurd" my expression pretty much mirrored Tyrion's exactly, and I knew what was coming to boot.

114	Lpearce7	2012-05-27	I honestly cannot describe how great this episode was. I really wasn't expecting so much of the actual battle, but I loved every second. I mean it was dead on the book  the majority of the time. And I can't believe how big that wildfire explosion was, and so GREEN! I can't wait for the season finale, but I don't know how it can top this.
Also, I loved Cersei's preformance, it was so much like the book, the way she lost it after hearing Lancel came in and said the battle was lost. And when Tywin stormed in, that was awesome. 
And Stannis was also great, He's starting to grow on me in the book, mainly because of the character on the show
115	OzorxOron	2012-05-27	Easily deserving of a 10, best episode of this season so far and probably will be overall.
116	olennaredyne	2012-05-27	A 9.5. It was brilliant, but I agree with those who felt like the Hound/Bronn exchange, for all its mildly interesting tension, was unnecessary given the sheer quantity of things that happen during the battle - Tyrion's charge was definitely too rushed - it seemed like they literally turned the tide within a matter of seconds, and then Tywin came charging in half a minute later. Tyrion's the heart and soul of the battle - I actually would havepreferred even more emphasis on him. 
Still, flipping awesome episode.
117	Morrigan	2012-05-27	Best episode of the season. Up there with the Pointy End and Baelor (my two favourites of the series). Gave it a 10 despite my nitpicks. Yes, I would have wished for something even bigger, with sweeping shots of massive armies outside of King's Landing, etc etc... but it's TV, not a 60-million dollar movie. And with the little budget they had, they did a fantastic job. Lena Heady stole the show, IMO. What a perfect, perfect Cersei.
118	Gaius Martell	2012-05-27	This was the best episode yet.  I guess that's to be expected when they spent the whole episode on four POVs; there's enough time to spend on each one.  Lena Headey was spot-on, and Peter Dinklage once again gives Tyrion such bravado that he is impossible not to love.  The only scene that seemed new was the Hound/ Bronn scene, which I thought added quite a bit, and since both are among my favorite characters, it was like "fan service" in a way.  Changing the battle to nighttime was a wise decision by the directors, methinks.
Adding to the glory of this episode is what's needed in the next one:  closure on Arya/ Jaqen, Arstan and Strong Belwas, HotU, and Jon Snow's next actions, Ramsay in Winterfell (I hope!) and perhaps a bit more Jaime/ Brienne.  Yeah, this season turned out alright.

122	Heathered	2012-05-28	Awesome, awesome, awesome! It was a little reminiscent of Peter Jackson's The Two Towers, but I don't care! (There were a few moments when I thought Halidir, or someone in a similar role, would fall to his knees with Tyrion/Aragorn screaming in anguish.)
I loved the battle scenes and appreciated the Cercei lulls in between. It was definitely worth the anticipation and the wait.
Oh, I give a ten and, like others, wish I could give it an eleven!

It was definitely worth the anticipation and the wait.I was telling my buddy who is a huge LOTR fanboy that the battle was going to be a lot like Helm's Deep from Two Towers. I had no idea how close it would actually be though. The mere fact that this episode can even be compared to the battle of Helm's Deep is incredible in itself. Everyone involved should give themselves a pat on the back because that was one of the best hours of television I've ever seen, and I've seen it all. This should put all the newbie fans concerns about the show not having enough action to rest and I'm willing to bet that the show grows in viewers again next year because it pulled off such an epic episode.
124	Dr. Pepper	2012-05-28	I literally couldn't blink from the moment the ships blew up until the credits!  It was bloody brilliant.  Everything was so great but my personal favorite was having a tune to go with the "Rains of Castamere".  It's stuck in my head now.  /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
125	Francisco R. Fonseca	2012-05-28	This episode was AWESOME! I loved the wildfire scene....they really captured that. The fight scenes were amazing. I  loved when Sandor was fighting and saw the flames, and you could just see the fear in his eyes. Him telling Joffrey to go fuck himself was an added bonus. I loved the end when Tyrion got cut even though he was on a ship in the book it was done well.
10/10
126	Direwolf Lager	2012-05-28	9/10 wildfire scene was incredible
127	Dark14	2012-05-28	amazing performances by all. Tyrion and Joffery giving there normal stuff and drunk Cersei was fantastic. The battle was the best fantasy battle scenes since LOTR.
128	Prince of Dragonstone	2012-05-28	Cersei was magnificent. Lena Headey is a goddess! It's hard to pull off terrifying and comical at the same time and she's perfected it!
The actress playing Sansa has come so far from last season. I really enjoyed her performance tonight. She's rocking the role now.
129	sharksbreath	2012-05-28	I didn't think there was any way they could meet the expectations for this episode - but wow.  That has to be one of the greatest hours of television ever.  Martin is brilliant.
130	BarrileteCosmico	2012-05-28	For 60 minutes I forgot this was a TV show and thought I was watching a blockbuster with a 300M budget. Fcking fantastic.
131	bardgal	2012-05-28	Ten out of ten for me.Great acting by all, but Rory McCann in particular was absolutely spot on.  The Hound went from an absolute terror (I counted two men cleaved in half) to absolutely terrified in a way that was very believable.  I like the palpable tension between him and Bronn before the battle.I've seen plenty of epic battle scenes in plenty of films by now.  What separates the great ones (Braveheart, LOTR, Saving Private Ryan) from the mediocre ones (Kingdom of Heaven, Troy) are the ramifications, the emotional investment that the viewer has in the outcome.  The scenes involving soldiers from both sides leading up to the battle, the dialogue on the battlements between Joffrey, Tyrion, Lancel, and the Hound, the silent fear of the women and children confined below, away from the fighting, Cersei's description of the inevitable rape/murder that the women would face if Stannis were to breach the gates, all of this made me care about The Battle of the Blackwater.A tip of the hat to everybody involved in this episode.  Fantastic hour of television.Agree completely. Except Kingdom of Heaven. See the Director's Cut. There's another 45min that was missing from the theatrical release, and it's an entirely different AWESOME film. The theatrical release is crap.
132	The  Halfhand	2012-05-28	Oh...my....god...this episode had my eyes watering from straight passion during the last 10 minutes.
The best episode I have ever seen. The changes the show writers made worked out fantastically. The best parts were...
-Podrick saving Tyrion and then the Imp slowly losing consciousness as he sees the combined Lord Tywin/Loras(in Renly's armor) cavalry storming in.
-Cersei's story to Tommen as she is accepting suicide and killing Tommen.
-Stannis' stubborn screams of fighting to the death as his soldiers pull him away from the battle.
-Sandor "Fuck the kingsguard, fuck the capitol, fuck the King"...and then San/San
-An honorable mention to Tyrion's "Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the King that the Hand is extremely busy" I lol'd
I can't think of other parts but, my god, that episode was perfect. /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' />

136	bardgal	2012-05-28	Good episode, But, I just do not see how everyone is rating it so high. The battle of Blackwater wasn't anything like the book and was dumbed down and cheesy. I love the show, But the battle was terrible. With CGI nowadays, no excuse for not following the book more closely. I think it looked like a B movie battle actually. Dark and cheaply made. My opinion.Really? Ok. Please explain HOW the chain and all the wildfire burning all over the Blackwater Rush could actually BE FILMED for an hour episodic television show. No really. Go on. I want to you to explain all of it. The shots, the story boarding, the camera angles, the way THE CHAIN would be filmed underwater - and above with all the green flames on top, with bodies underneath, and oh - HOW MANY SHIPS burning and for what distance.Then you need to tell me WHERE that would be filmed, and HOW MANY DAYS you'd schedule to do that. Oh, and how much you think all of that, WITH POST, would cost.What they did was brilliant x âˆ<U+009E> for a visual medium to tell basically the same tale.
137	BoldAsYouPlease	2012-05-28	9/10 for me.
Good: This was the first time I really liked the performance of the guy playing Stannis - not the Conan stuff, but for the first time I saw some of the implacable will and iron determination of the Stannis in the books. Stannis was about business tonight.  I continue to be impressed with the woman playing Cersei, both in the scenes in the Maidenvault and in her scene with Tommen on the throne. It's become routine to praise Peter Dinklage but he deserved it even more than usual tonight - every Tyrion scene tonight was riveting. The confrontation between Bronn and Sandor was odd, but it worked out pretty well. And for the first time in the show I was really feeling Sansa's plight tonight. All in all, very nicely done.
Bad: Can't think of anything much, really. More CGI ships and troops would have helped, but that's a quibble. They stuck pretty close to the written story, and the script benefited enormously.
P.S. Just remembered that Martin wrote the script, so of course it stuck close to the written story /laugh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' />

Cersei should just be drunk all the time and the scene with Tommen at the end was so powerful. Sansa was so flawless it hurt. Overall one of the best episodes yet. I can't wait until next week.

After 'Rains of Castamere' and Sansa's hymn, I now have hopes for the 'Maiden and the Bear' in future episodes.
Though I might really cry if I hear someone else singing 'Rains' over the credits of a future episode....
I just got to watch this again later.
144	ICE CROW	2012-05-28	Best episode of the season, even with the changes here and there they did the battle of Blackwater justice.
My favourite part of the episode was the Hound finally being shown the way he was meant to be shown, his Scene with Sansa though a little different was perfect. It was as if when GRRM was writing this episode he sat back and said these fuckers have not done Sandor Clegane justice in the series so far, let me show them how it is done.
I wish GRRM could write every episode!.

Second watch through though I really liked it.I think the writers are doing a really decent job with what they have. There are some things I don't like or agree with but you can't please everyone. If GRRM wrote them all though that would be perfection.. just don't take away from his TWOW writing time. c;
146	Ser Bryson of Wooded Ridge	2012-05-28	I loved how Bronn had such a big part in this episode as well as his actions. it seemed better to me that bronn shot a firery arrow into the wildfire rather than whip some oxen to pull the chain up. also the conflict with the Hound in the begining was amazing! as well as what he said to tyrion. This episode made Bronn come to life as i had imagined him when i read the books.
147	Eira Seren	2012-05-28	10.
This is how it is done.
Loved the moments with Tyrion and Bronn, and Bronn and Sandor.  Great to see the tension getting to characters before the fight.
Thought Stannis was leading the men up the wall to provide contrast with Joffrey, who doesn't lead his men.
And when Varys says he hates the bells, they always sound for horror. . .  and Tyrion mentions weddings. . .

The shots, the story boarding, the camera angles, the way THE CHAIN would be filmed underwater - and above with all the green flames on top, with bodies underneath, and oh - HOW MANY SHIPS burning and for what distance.Some people are just ridiculous. They forget to even film a battle ship scene you need to get a huge water tank, tons of CGI, and expert stuntmen. To pull off what we even saw was a minor miracle. Not to mention saucyjak seems to enjoy picking fights.

151	greatgeek	2012-05-28	9.9/10
Perfect but for the rushed ending.
152	antisocial	2012-05-28	It was a 10 episode for sure.Im very glad they saved their CGI budget for the Blackwater explosion. I hit the 30 sec rewind just to watch that again, and thats something I never do. For me it breaks the rythm, but it was just so damn awesome. I loved the drawn out flight of Bronns fire arrow. That little scene in itself built so much anticipation and dread.And absolutly loved the Cersei - Sansa scenes, OMG! She was so much like a cat tormenting a mouse and was so enjoying breaking that fairy-tail world Sansa was living in. That was the evil bitch from the books that I love to hate. For me Lena and Sophies performance edged out the battle scenes as my favorite parts of the episode, and I do love me some dismemeberment bloody battles, but I really do think they were that good in their scenes.I was wondering if they were even going to give Tyrion a battle wound. And I have to say when I seen it my eyes bugged out and I was like  "FUUUUCK!", it looked so damn real. And yes I hit the 30 sec rewind yet again.Peter is really great on screen, I would say more than anyone else he really makes me believe he is Tyrion. (Not saying the others dont, he just is that character when hes acting him)And the end when Charles Dance as Tywin comes bursting in, with Ser Loras looking grim as hell, saying it was over and they have won, it was a "Fuck yeah!!!" reaction, and then a "Wait a minute, I fucking hate the Lannisters!"LOLFor me this episode was a roller coster ride of emotions. A for me it shows that was very well written and directed.Now Im off to watch it again.
153	drigoly	2012-05-28	theending was to rushed, so only a 9 :/
154	boojam	2012-05-28	I felt exactly the same way about Stannis going first up the ladder with no protection. The reason kings and generals didn't lead their armies from the front, historically, is because it generally turned out disastrously. For every Leonidas who dies heroically, there's a Brasidas who dies fighting over a stupid city like Amphipolis.It kind of varied didn't it? Alexander the Great did lead from the front, nearly got him killed in India. Not sure about Julius Caesar once he became commanding 'general'. I don't think he did, seems I remember, for the most part the roman emperors did lead from rear, or were not at the battle at all.Tho... in medieval warfare , which is the model here, the 'in front' lead commander was , not always, the king, but warfare evolved such this mode of operation was abandoned.Ah well ... I am not sure what George may have written...it seems like a glitch... why does Stannis not wear a helm in action? Was that true in the book? (In the book he was not at the KL assault.) In fact in this episode we see , at one point, one of his men shielding Stannis's head with a shield. It would have been an easy action sequence to fix, even if Stannis went first, just carrying a shield would have made more sense.But I think part of that is not really knowing WTF he was doing. Maybe I missed something. Did that battlement lead directly to the holdfast or was there some other directly strategic value there?I can see why clearing the battlement of defenders may have been necessary to enable the breaking of the gate and allow the assault to be less harassed. Must of been a budget thing because from the point of view the battlement seemed to shrink , maybe all those tight camera angles.

155	TheEvilKing	2012-05-28	10/10 like a motherfucker.
Best bits from memory having just finished it:
Dat creepy, quiet, tense pre-battle build-up, especially Davos/Matthos and Varys/Tyrion
Bronn/The Hound rivalry
WILDFIRE EXPLOSION
Stannis kicking ass
Drunken Cersei
Scared Joffrey
Scared Hound
Cersei and Tommen on the Iron Throne
Tyrion cutting legs off
Dat ending
Rains of Castamere credits
Lived up the hype. And there's still an episode left.
156	Daenerys	2012-05-28	I was pretty hard on last week's episode (and a lot of this season on the whole), but this was a pretty satisfying episode, I really enjoyed it. I love that Martin was able to change a few things up from his own writing in the books, I can imagine that'd be a hard thing to do. Overall I still think this series could be a lot better if they free themselves up from the letter of the books more (in other words, keep the spirit of the books and the main characters intact, but shuffle it up to tighten up the plot and pacing), but for the second season in a row, Episode 9 rocks.
157	Ran	2012-05-28	Zippypoodle,
Pretty sure GRRM didn't have a choice in it. They told him they wanted him in the forefront because it was more dramatic and visually appealing, and he wrote it that way. In the novels, Stannis is indeed very much the type to lead from the rear, finding a good position to overview everything and making adjustments. He's not the vanguard type.
158	Davos55	2012-05-28	Absolutely a 10! I just stopped on here to say that..I really need to go watch it again. Damn..so so good!
159	Despot	2012-05-28	A strong 9. 
It was really, really good. 
I was surprised with Stannis in the first lines, but again, I do think there are a reasons for that. So far, Stannis had -what? - 4,5 scenes ? 
He wasn't  build properly as a hard warrior, a men with an iron determination, and a great threat to Lannisters. That was my impression, and one
of the greatest objections that I had to the season 2. 
But this Stannis, Stannis who leads his men, surely looks like a great threat, although he suffered defeat. They need to achieve that impression,because Stannis story isn't finished, and TV audience need to have that impression of a danger. It will make show as interesting
as books or closely there. 
That's my explanation of Stannis in a "Conan" style. 
Cercei was great and beyond that. Really, really nice acting.
160	The Monkey	2012-05-28	9/10
The visual effects were mindblowing in most cases, especially the wildfire explosion. The acting was top-notch (as it always is), I wish the Lena Headey haters would shut up. Her acting in this episode is some of the best stuff you will ever see on TV.
My only mayor gripe i I have with this episode, is that we never got so a sense of how big the competing armies are. It just seemed like a few hundred men on each side. Stannis is supposed to have 20,000 men (in the book, probably more in the show, as it's implied that the majority of Renly's 100,000 troops joined him, with the Tyrells having to flee and all). I know they did a hell of a good job on a limited budget, but just a few CGI shots, showing a vast amount of soldiers, would've been nice.
Ah well, great episode regardless, can't wait the dynamics between Cersei, Tyrion, Tywin, Margaery and Joffrey next episode/season, it's gonna rock.

161	GeorgeIAF	2012-05-28	I think that this is the best ever episode so far, i don't care that they didn't use the chain, it was perfect without it.
The battle scenes were great, everything was superb. It gave me chills, even though i have read the books. 10 !

162	HyacinthGirl	2012-05-28	Ohmygod the National doing the Reynes of Castamere for the end credits was just... I think this is the first time I've enjoyed the end credits of a tv show episode as much as the actual episode, if that makes sense. Very, very happy fan here.
And the epsiode itself blew me away. I don't even have words. asdhlsgfajijgaer;pfo'kads;f. Nope, no words.
163	salt	2012-05-28	GRRM is great at writing these.  I hope he gets the 
	Spoiler RW next season, and the battle at the Wall in season 4.

164	Conchobar	2012-05-28	Wait... the Red wedding is going to be next season? I thought it was in the second half of the third book?
165	FirelordSylar22	2012-05-28	GRRM is great at writing these.  I hope he gets the RW next season, and the battle at the Wall in season 4.Thanks for the spoiler.
166	NedFlanderStark	2012-05-28	Seriously though, this was the second best or absolute best episode of this series.  Anyone complaining is a straight up snitch, dirty snitch.
167	salt	2012-05-28	Thanks for the spoiler.I thought that was too general to be considered a spoiler, but I'll tag it.
168	BlackTalon	2012-05-28	doubtless the best episode of the season and one of the best episode of the series so far. That wildfire explosion surpassed my wildest expectations Awesome and terrifying. Actually I think it was better than it would have been with the chain, I donÂ´t miss that at all. Loved the Rains of Castamere in the credits.This is how you write an episode.I have been saving the 10/10 rating all season for this episode, so here it is:10/10
169	Trinket2	2012-05-28	Really good one! Best episode in the series! Didn't feel as rushed as many of the previous ones.
The wildfire explosion was really cool.
And Tywin is just awesome.
Loved the rains of Castamere in the credits!
170	Smooth	2012-05-28	Even knowing the outcome, I was still on the edge of my seat the whole time. Like a kid on Christmas for Rains(Reynes) of Castamere. The explosion, the green flame, even the stuff with the girls, it was all fantastic. Definitely a 10 from me.
171	TC_Chaos	2012-05-28	Good to see so many people rated 10. Best episode for the show. Great effort of making the fight as epic as it was written. Man, only one more episode to go...
172	aashish	2012-05-28	Epic.
173	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-28	Incredible episode. Solid 9; missing a point for the slight gutting of Sansa's bedroom scene.
174	Kvothe_ModTech	2012-05-28	Probably the best episode of the show so far, out of both seasons, it had everything, laughs, great kills, action, quiet scenes. Loved it.
10!
175	Law Lord	2012-05-28	One of the best episodes I've ever seen in a TV show. Definitely a 10 from me.
176	Arkash	2012-05-28	10... perfect, mind-blowing.
177	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-28	A 10, definitely. Ohgosh, the wildfire, that was straight perfect! Just as I imagined, like a great firework. The look on their faces; priceless.
Loved the Rains of Castamere during the credits, just after Lord Tywin saves the city and looks like he's the ruler of the world. I felt actually kinda sorry for Cersei this episode, sitting there with Tommen, preparing to kill themselves. She truly loves her children, it's only that she's an arrogant bitch.
And, finally, the Sandor/Sansa scene. I liked the doll she had, a reference to her father, whom she needs desperately at that moment. I died when Sandor said 'No, I won't hurt you little bird,', while Sansa's face softened. Too bad she didn't cup his cheek as in the books, but that's alright. The whole episode was epic awesomeness.
178	sumpthy	2012-05-28	10/10 for sure.
I liked Jerome Flynn (Bronn) getting the chance to show off his singing skills. Maybe we'll get a Robson & Jerome cover of the Rains of Castamere...
179	bikie	2012-05-28	this show build the tension before a battle of any film or show I've seen... and the battle delivered... wish GRRM had the juice left in the tank to write every episode...
180	The Meeraculous Third Reed	2012-05-28	No point doing my usual pros and cons, because almost everything in this episode was perfect. The shot of the wildfyre burning the ships was beyond anything I've ever seen on the small screen.
What I would say above anything else though is that Lean Headey was amazing. Better than anyone else, and that is saying something. 
My only minor gripe is the seeming reluctance to connect Sansa with the Old Gods. The difference in religion is important. I am barrel scraping though. Just a damned good episode. 
Another thing. Sophie Turner is already damned attractive, and me realising that makes me feel a little dirty.
181	duncanthemedium	2012-05-28	A perfect ten 10. Bloody brilliant!!!
GRRM should write the RW and the PW episodes next season too!!! OH MY GODDDDDDD....I have already seen the episode twice!
182	Ser Graymax	2012-05-28	Want to give it a 10 but I just cant although a 9+ isnt bad and I havent seen it a second time yet..  Just seemed a little rushed to me and we never got the feeling of the massiveness of the numbers involved in the battle.  Perhaps this should have been spread over 2 episodes but I realize the constraints.  Still some of the best TV ever, Id love to see this entire series on the big screen with massive sound.
We needed the little girl from "Dispicable Me" looking out the battlements and yelling to Tyrion "Its so GREEN!"
Pig shit and Turtles and Sandor finally speaking his mind, oh my.
All of the changes seem to be coming together very nicely.  Some people just have no patience to wait for the big picture.  Their loss.

183	duncanthemedium	2012-05-28	I wonder how anyone willfully gave this episodes the 6s and the 7s I spot up there...
Hmmm... so a 10 would be the televisation of the Second Coming? Or would Jesus' visual effects and make up or whatever maybe even get that down to a 9??
 /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />
184	The Black Wolf	2012-05-28	Loved it! 10/10! The wildfire was amazing, Sansa and Cersei talking was just incredible, and the final scene with Cersei and Tommen had me crying! Oh, and of course the Hound was awesome: "fuck the Kingsguard, fuck the city, fuck the king"... I think it's the first time I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever (only I would have wanted this episode to go on forever, because now we only have one episode left this season).
185	Mediumjon Umber	2012-05-28	10.
That was some serious amount of pig shit! /ohmy.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':o' />
186	Lord Over	2012-05-28	10 out of 10, there's nothing else to say
187	Sanette	2012-05-28	Martin is a pure genius. I wish he could write all the episodes. There was more drama in this episode alone than in the whole season. I loved the changes. Stannis leading the attack was a nice touch. It reminded me why I like his character. And the final shot with Loras as Renly's ghost and Cersei with Tommen on the throne was just breathtaking. The best episode this season and I have absolutely no complaints. Hopefully, D&D felt inspired by it and the finale is at least half as good.
10/10
188	Sydney Losstarot	2012-05-28	Between 7 and 8 for me.
Considering the difficulty of translating the book's epic battle on TV, they did and amazing job. But, in spite of all their efforts, notably shooting at night and using epic music and all, it still felt small scale in some parts. There are also problems with the pacing, notably Tyrion's sortie felt awfully rushed.
The highlights of this episode are very strong though. Incredible, incredible performance from Lena Headey. Just the perfect Cersei. I loved all of her scenes. Sansa is most definitely coming into her own too. I liked the scene with Sandor in her room, even though it was weaker than the book's, but the acting she put out when realising that Sandor would not hurt her was just perfect. Sandor does not feel half as menacing and dangerous as book Sandor though. The way he said fuck the king and all felt weak too. But the scene with Bronn in the tavern was good. Bronn is very well casted and played.
I like the actor playing Davos very much, he exudes calmness and authority, and humbleness, just like the character in the book. 
Incredible CGI on the wildfire explosion. THAT felt epic indeed, no problem there. 
The gory effects in the batlle, such as Clegane cutting guys in two, and Stannis splitting heads, felt...cheap. Like a B zombie movie. This was so bad it took me out of the action. 
Also, I can understand why they would put Stannis on the front line, but well...this was soooo out of character. Stannis is a commander. He's not lacking bravery, and has surely seen his share of battle. But he commands from the rear, to keep a clear vision of what's happening. Having him rush the walls WITHOUT A HELMET felt...oh, I'm sorry, it just felt ridiculous. Overall, I'm not happy with the characterisation of Stannis up until now. Melisandre has more charisma than him. If I didn't know him better from the books...
A magnificent Tyrion, as usual. The scene where the king's guard cuts him though...felt weak. And come on Tyrion, it's just a little cut this time. Why fall on the ground like he cut your nose or something??
I'm very critical, but overall it was a good time. I don't feel it was the incredible TV epic some of you guys describe though, but it was still very good. Thank you Cersei!!
189	Little Miss Sunshine	2012-05-28	This was brilliant. Simply brilliant. This is HOW you adapt book scenes to TV!
And Lena Heady stole the show. They were all brilliant, but she... no words, absolutely no words.
190	iamsbee	2012-05-28	A 10/10 for sure.
191	Arya The Assassin	2012-05-28	My first 10 this season /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
192	House Balstroko	2012-05-28	By the Old Gods and the New, a perfect 10!
The buildup to the battle was epic, with Stannis fleet slowwly creeping its way through the water with the fog looming over them.The wildfire exploding was just out of this world. We finally got the Rains of Castamere. Cersei is acting like her old psycho self. Tyrion delivered an amazing speech. Pretty much everything.
Valar Morghulis!!!
193	Dolores Stark	2012-05-28	Amazing episode! Loved it! It had me yelling, laughing, jumping and (who'd have known) rooting for F-ing Lannisters! Everyone nailed it with their performance, but Lena really stole the show.
Tuwin's entrance was /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' />
I gave it a 10 of course.
194	7V3N	2012-05-28	I think it need to be said--give GRRM 3 episodes: premiere, finale, and high-point episodes. This way, we get out excellent intro, we get our excellent Blackwater scene, we get our awesome finale that leaves us begging for more.
195	Lord of Cheese	2012-05-28	Not bad not bad.
Some things annoyed me though:
I didnt like the fact that everyone seems to be wielding a valyrian steel sword!! So many bodies being cloven in two and heads halved cleanly. Silly. Even Tyrion had a valyrian steel axe cutting off a leg! And the splatting. D&D have been watching too many old chinese martial arts movies were blood sprays after a cut.
I didnt like Tyrion's scar. Maybe im wrong but it looks like a fairly clean cut. He will lose an eye, but doesnt look like he will lose part of his nose and have a hideous scar. They should have opened it up more hehe. Make it more gruesome to scare the hell out of the viewers. But maybe they dont want to ruin his face too much so he is still recognisable on tv.
Lancel not getting cut down badly enough.
Was it communicated clear enough that Sandor was afraid of the fire and not just the battle? In the books we can see the inner dialogue going on in Sandors head but not in TV. I will ask my non bookreader friends tomorrow.
What i liked:
Sandor,
Sansa,
Cersei!!!!,
Illyn's facial expression. lol.
Pretty much nailed though. The dialogue impressed a lot. The chain would have made it epic though!!! But they would have had to change the battle dynamics and made it much larger scale.
Not surprised to learn that GRRM wrote this one. By the 7 bloody hells its obvious it was him. The other writers were rubbish compared to him. Martin to write them ALL!!
196	Chelly	2012-05-28	A 10/10 for me. That episode was sheer perfection. I loved every moment of it. EVERYBODY brought their A game in this episode. Sansa was fantastic this episode. Cersei was at her absoulute best. That scene between her and Tommen was heartbreaking. I can't believe I used the term heartbreaking in regards to Cersei, she's such a nasty, vile woman, but she has her moments.
Stannis was ON! I'm loving terminator Stannis cutting fuckers down who get in his way.
Sandor was also amazing this episode. I love seeing the other side of Sandor, first with the fire phobia and then in his moment with Sandor. I don't care but I fistpumped at "Fuck the kingsguard, fuck the city, fuck the king". The look on Joff's face was priceless.
197	7V3N	2012-05-28	Ok, I have not seen it mentioned enough. Props to Jack Gleeson. The guy has done a hell of a job with Joffrey. He needs some sort of award.

198	DonnaG99	2012-05-28	Fantastic! Must be watched several times to catch all the intricate details.
199	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-28	Ok, I have not seen it mentioned enough. Props to Jack Gleeson. The guy has done a hell of a job with Joffrey. He needs some sort of award.I actually felt a little sympathy for him here. He came off as genuinely scared witless, and even his most loyal defender tells him to go fuck himself...
200	Dru	2012-05-28	Easiest and first 10 I've given out this season. Best episode out of both seasons and may be the best hour of television I have ever watched!!!! Just finished my 3rd watch through. The build up to the battle was AMAZING!!! Me and my wife agree that it felt like the build up to Helms Deep in The Two Towers. All I can say is WOW!!! Wish GRRM was writing every episode though I would rather he finish the books. Great, great GREAT!!!
201	miguel sanchez	2012-05-28	That kicked raw ass!So many of those scenes were fuckin' perfect. The actors fuckin' nailed those classic lines from the book. Bronn and the gold cloaks singing the rains of castamere, an awesome inclusion. The wildfire explosion: off the fuckin' chain!! The violence! The Hound, Stannis, Bronn, all extremely badass! Oh and that whole scene with Cersei and Sansa was really fantastic and true to the book, like I thought Lena Headey was a fairly good Cersei but now it's elevated to a damn near perfect Cersei. The hound walking out was great, as was Joffrey being a little puss and better still was Tyrion getting his moment as the hero, great battle speach. And then he gets to kill some guys! I loved it when Tyrion kills guys when I was reading. And then you fuckin' have Tywin riding in at the end and Cersei's little story to Tommen and, ahem, 'medicine', Tyrion gettin' hacked and Pod saving him... ahh man whole ending was brilliant. I loved Stannis having to be dragged away from the battle yelling "stand and fight damn you!", it's so Stannis, dude is nothing if not determined.Gave it a fuckin' 10. Fuckin' aye. I've given one 9 and two 8s but this is my first fuckin' perfect 10!
202	pleonasm	2012-05-28	My first impression was that this was really impressive. The hour flew by. Not perfect, by any means, but very well done. There was a couple of really outstanding moments. Even Joffrey (and Lancel) was written with a more nuanced hand tonight. I loved what happened with Davros and his son. Truly tragic.
A couple of minor quibbles.
Other than for dumbing for the audience, I don't know why they didn't show more of the King's Landing fleet moored in the bay. It would have taken the Wildfire explosion (which was awesome) to a whole new level of awesomeness. 
I wasn't sold on the Sansa and the Hound scene. Given the direction they went with the scene, I wish they had made the Hound 'stinking drunk' at this point. So Sansa's motivation to not go with him would make more sense.
A scene or two of Stannis commmanding would have been helpful. Yes - Ass kicking Stannis is cool, but he was leading an army, and we kinda lost that with his rushing ahead at every opportunity.
Other than Tyrion's, the slice and dice CGI shots of decapitating soldiers were silly and did take u out of the moment.
That said, this was so much better than the last three episodes and easily one of the most rewatchable episodes in the series history.
A solid 9.
203	Greywolf2375	2012-05-28	Good episode, But, I just do not see how everyone is rating it so high. The battle of Blackwater wasn't anything like the book and was dumbed down and cheesy. I love the show, But the battle was terrible. With CGI nowadays, no excuse for not following the book more closely. I think it looked like a B movie battle actually. Dark and cheaply made. My opinion.My guess as to why many people are rating it highly is because the acting & dialogue was the best this series has seen.  The battle - as fun as it was to watch - was completely made secondary to the characters - which is exactly how GRRM wrote the books.  Yes, the books had the creeping snakes of flame and hundreds of ships....and the show didn't.  But it did have CGI that made - as Triskele pointed out - the 6th highest grossing film of all time, RotK, looks like I made the graphics with crayola crayons.   Everyone is different, everyone has their opinion, but try watching this one again for the people, not the explosions and maybe you'll see it in a different light.
204	Mooncat	2012-05-28	Easily the best episode of Game of Thrones so far. The buildup from the last episode was slow, but this definitively made up for the waiting. Despite the lack of 'Renly ghost' and chain, I thought the battle was brilliant.
The acting was even better. Sophie Turner was fantastic. I couldn't stop shouting that Joffrey was such a little shit; Jack Gleeson is doing so much right. 
The Hound still creeps me out, and I still don't care about Davos. 
10/10, without a doubt. Seriously. There was finally an actual battle!
205	Greywolf2375	2012-05-28	Regarding Hollywoodizing Stannis and other major characters in any movie/show, it's the fact that they rarely given them helmets. Stannis could have had his head crushed.But this episode: 10 10 10 10 10, 10 on everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Seen this a few times - take Blackhawk Down.  The producers decided they had to put names on each characters helmets to make sure the audience could identify the characters easily.  Same thing here - is it unrealistic, sure, but with the number of people not being able to identify that it was a Kingsguard - Moore - that nicked off Tyrions cheek I think it was the right choice for them to have some characters go without helms.Course it would have been bad ass if they did have the Hound with his dog helmet on.  As long as it didn't bounce around like it was made of aluminum foil.
206	Greywolf2375	2012-05-28	I wonder how anyone willfully gave this episodes the 6s and the 7s I spot up there...Hmmm... so a 10 would be the televisation of the Second Coming? Or would Jesus' visual effects and make up or whatever maybe even get that down to a 9?? /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />Or they have a different opinion than you and had different expectations for it.  If you enjoyed it, why let what someone else thought of it bug you?
207	legba11	2012-05-28	Normally I rate after a second viewing.  No point to here.  I just wish they had an option 11.
208	KnightsOfDany	2012-05-28	Too bad there is no option over 10, who voted a 3 I'll have there head on a pike, jk everyone is entitled to an opinion i guess
209	Flou	2012-05-28	Easily the best episode this season.
210	EgoistMusketeer	2012-05-28	That was K-razy !
211	saucyjak	2012-05-28	Some people are just ridiculous. They forget to even film a battle ship scene you need to get a huge water tank, tons of CGI, and expert stuntmen. To pull off what we even saw was a minor miracle. Not to mention saucyjak seems to enjoy picking fights.Ive posted on this forum 4 times. The only other post is in literature reccomendations. Why do you say I enjoy picking fights? Many times on a forum thread such as this, many wouldn't bother to post agnist the vast majority because of responses such as yours.	 As many people that are rating this Ten, They are ALL saying, basically, that the episode  could not be better or improved upon. I enjoyed the episode, I never would of read ASOIF if not for seeing this excellent series. I guess My knowledge of the cost of CGI is lacking, That doesn't mean Im gonna jump on the fanboy wagon and say how awesome the battle was when it could not even come close to what is described in the book. Yes the Green fire was quite nice, But the actual fighting was pretty lame IMHO. The fact that they changed the batlle ALOT more then just leaving out the chain, also did not impress. Somone has to counter the "Awesome Awesome 10, 10 ,10 comments, with some reality. I would rate the episode a 9, without the battle, and a 6 with the battle. MHO, that is if Im allowed one without being accused of picking a fight, which I am not, nor am I trolling,
212	BoldAsYouPlease	2012-05-28	Wait... the Red wedding is going to be next season? I thought it was in the second half of the third book?Actually the Red Wedding sort of ended the first half of ASoS. If they indeed split ASoS into two seasons then the Red Wedding episode definitely needs to be the finale of next season - hopefully Martin will script it. It'd be a phenomenal, devastating conclusion to the season.

213	jarl the climber	2012-05-28	I rated the episode a nine, I tend to like that they focus more time on developing the story than on action sequences. They did the best they could with the budget they had. Shifting between the battle and Cersei/Sansa kind of hurt the pace a little. Did Ser Illyn Payne deliberately let Sansa go, knowing Cersei wanted her murdered if the city fell? It was never clear in the book but it seems like he might have a heart after all.
214	JonF311	2012-05-28	Overall an excellent episode, and I gave it a 10.
Some minor quibbles:
- The Tyrion-leading-the-charge scene did feel rushed as others noticed.
- The wildfire special effects were awesome, though as others noted the book left the impression the fire filled the entire river and was more critical to Stannis' defeat.
- At some point the series should have established how Sandor came by his own burn scars; the scene where he turns tail would have been
more comprehensible to those who haven't read the books.
- Yes, we have to have a naked whore. Good grief, will the gratuitous T&A never end?
Some quibbles with other comments:
- Yes, a single "ghost ship" coming out of the mist is suspicious-- but what are Davos et al supposed to do? Stannis' fleet does not consist of hydroplanes. There's no "Reverse engines!" possible.
- Ancient and medieval leaders often did lead at the vanguard in the pre-firearms days. Armor and skill were to protect them. Yes, sometimes they came to grief but them were the breaks. Leading from the rear was very poorly thought of. But Stannis does need a helmet. Why not give him a very obvious one, something stag-like with some hint of the Lord of Light?
- The Cersei scenes, IMO, were quite properly balanced with the battle scenes. It brought home the creeping fear women would endure shut up in a castle with no idea how things were going-- and knowing what their own fate would be if the city fell.
- Yes, Cersei is mean to Sansa-- she genuinely does think the girl is stupid. But (IMO) she's not just being a sadist, unlike Joffrey. On some level she's also trying to toughen Sansa up, knowing all too well what the girl is heading for if she marries Joff. There's a touch-- just a touch-- of womanly comraderie in her bitchiness.
A couple more comments:
- Lena Headley deserves an Emmy for this season. She has created a believable human Cersei, with all her nastiness intact, yet a woman we can alsounderstand, something Martin in the books has badly failed to do. Even knowing that she would not poison Tommen at the end, I believed she might do it. And note where she goes to die: to the Iron Throne she could not actually make her own. There's also a creepy note of unconscious prohecy in her drunken words and the parable she tells Tommen: has she in fact written Joffrey off bit can't admit it to herself?
- I had a fleeting flash of sympathy for Joffrey during his indecision whether to obey his mother's summons or stay at the battle. it lasted about .8 seconds, but it was real while it was there.
- Uh-oh. Cersei smells something fishy about Shae.
- Good grief, even Lancel was good tonight instead of being a total simpering idiot!  Yes, he ran back to Cersei after getting a flesh wound, but then stood up to her.
- Go Podrick!
215	saucyjak	2012-05-28	My guess as to why many people are rating it highly is because the acting & dialogue was the best this series has seen.  The battle - as fun as it was to watch - was completely made secondary to the characters - which is exactly how GRRM wrote the books.  Yes, the books had the creeping snakes of flame and hundreds of ships....and the show didn't.  But it did have CGI that made - as Triskele pointed out - the 6th highest grossing film of all time, RotK, looks like I made the graphics with crayola crayons.   Everyone is different, everyone has their opinion, but try watching this one again for the people, not the explosions and maybe you'll see it in a different light.I agree, Masterfully done episode, when considering the dialogue and acting. The characters are what makes this series so wonderful. The epicness of the battle of Blackwater was lost. I just do not see whay everyone is giving it a 10, Unless its a "10 considering the lack of funds they had for the battle scenes" regardless, I loved the episode, just trying to bring things down to earth a bit. Inject a little reality
216	Bambi	2012-05-28	OMG, i jizzed in my pants when the wildfire banged. /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> 
2 little dislikes: the sudden cuts when tyrion freed the mud gate - it was totally out of blue to me. The other minor dislike: too much of Cersei, i love him playing but a lot of her lines didn't add anything new to her character imo, those screentimes could've been spent on other things - maybe an explenation why is Loras there. I'm pretty sure it will be included in the final episode anyway.
217	Zach H	2012-05-28	The super violent action was rather inadvertantly comical a bunch of times.   I was reminded of Conan the Librarian from UHF where he chops a guy in half down the middle.  The Bronn/Dog scene felt off even not taking into consideration the eye-rolling nudity (every time I think they phased it out of the show it comes back).  Ser Ilyan...yeah, more inadvertant laughs every time they show him.  Once again I lamented not seeing what was going on beyond the wall--I realize time considerations and all that but for whatever reason that storyline really carries the show for me.
Pretty good other than that, though.  8/10.  Close to as good as epic fantasy can probably get on TV, but still not quite speaking to me in the manner that a series like Deadwood managed.  Last three mintues plus the end credits were amazing, however.

219	bardgal	2012-05-28	doubtless the best episode of the season and one of the best episode of the series so far. That wildfire explosion surpassed my wildest expectations Awesome and terrifying. Actually I think it was better than it would have been with the chain, I donÂ´t miss that at all. Loved the Rains of Castamere in the credits.This is how you write an episode.I have been saving the 10/10 rating all season for this episode, so here it is:10/10YES. I think it was actually MUCH BETTER without the chain.
220	Ghost of Crackclaw	2012-05-28	My first 10, in two seasons of this show. Every element was pitch-perfect, and no character was written against character. (It helps that the writer was, well, the Author.)This is how you adapt a show for television, departures and all, while remaining faithful to the text. Would that all the episodes had this same fidelity.
221	bardgal	2012-05-28	Ok, I have not seen it mentioned enough. Props to Jack Gleeson. The guy has done a hell of a job with Joffrey. He needs some sort of award.Gods! ALL OF THEM DO! The casting of this series, for me, is mindblowingly PERFECT.
222	Lion of Red	2012-05-28	10/10Best episode of this season by far, perhaps of both seasons.I loved Tyrion and Stannis is this episode and the wildfire was awesome.The deviations from the book didn't bother me because I actually liked them, with the possible change of the nudity in the Bronn&Sandor scene which i otherwise liked.But then the nudity and sex scenes in this show always make me roll my eyes.I loved the inclusion of The Rains of Castamere with Bronn and in the credits.
223	Mirabilia	2012-05-28	I loved Stannis on the front lines, I know it's far different from the book where he leads from behind, but I think this is more fitting of his character.
I loved the wildfire, Tyrion, The Rains of Castamere, wow it was just perfect.
224	moonrise	2012-05-28	Although it was a perfectly written episode, I'm not that fond of endless battle sequences. I did miss some non-King's Landing action. The finale should be epic. Too bad Martin is only writing a single episode per season. I'd give him at least the last two episodes of each season to write.
225	bardgal	2012-05-28	Someone has to counter the "Awesome Awesome 10, 10 ,10 comments, with some reality. The reality is, the Battle of the Blackwater, is UNFILMABLE as written. Period. Wildfire doesn't exist, and it's only an hour episode. Wildfire keeps burning - for days. The budget for The Hobbit wouldn't cover the amount of ships, sets along the river/in the river, trained extras, stunt actors/coordinators, CGI, and TIME needed to film it AS WRITTEN. You cannot do everything CGI. You have to have a foundation to base it on, otherwise it looks terribad.Overall an excellent episode, and I gave it a 10. Some minor quibbles: - The Tyrion-leading-the-charge scene did feel rushed as others noticed.I don't get this. How much longer should it have been? Did you want horses?  To see them mount up? That would take longer, getting them saddled and all, but they really were going around the corner and out the gate. Tywin riding in would have been diminished and confused if there were horses elsewhere. Besides, we only have 60min. I'd love someone explaining the "rushed" thing so I understand why you feel that way.- The wildfire special effects were awesome, though as others noted the book left the impression the fire filled the entire river and was more critical to Stannis' defeat.Please see my unfilmable explantion above. It is mentioned several times in the episode that the entire river is on fire.- At some point the series should have established how Sandor came by his own burn scars; the scene where he turns tail would have been more comprehensible to those who haven't read the books.Did you miss the Hand's Tounrey from season one, where Littlefinger explains it to Sansa?- Yes, we have to have a naked whore. Good grief, will the gratuitous T&A never end?Nope. It's HBO. My only quibble with last night's scene is where is the Brazillian Wax shop in Fleabottom? I mean, COME ON. Some quibbles with other comments: - Yes, a single "ghost ship" coming out of the mist is suspicious-- but what are Davos et al supposed to do? Stannis' fleet does not consist of hydroplanes. There's no "Reverse engines!" possible. - Ancient and medieval leaders often did lead at the vanguard in the pre-firearms days. Armor and skill were to protect them.

Yes, he ran back to Cersei after getting a flesh wound, but then stood up to her. - Go Podrick!Mostly agree, and really great points! I totally get why none of the leads have helmets - non-book readers would be lost, and it certainly didn't help the guy next to Stannis. As it is, my non-book friends are wondering who the hell tried to kill Tyrion - because he was wearing a helmet. Even The Hound didn't have his, and right now, his is the only recognizable one aside from Gendry's who never wore his.I thought the Shea scene was awesome. Didn't see that coming, and added a LOT to already heightened tension.Cersei getting a head start on getting her drink on will make more sense going forward for the TV series.Brilliant episode. Brilliant series!
226	TeamDanyArya	2012-05-28	To quote Spinal Tap, this goes to 11. Or 100 if I could. Blackwater was the single greatest thing I've seen done on TV that was non-sports related. I loved the back-and-forth between the action sequences and Cersei. All the similarities and contrasts between Cersei and Sansa. Sansa acting like the adult in the situation and trying to stay calm while Cersei gets her drunk on. Her very careful sarcastic reply to Joffery about being stupid (bring out your inner direwolf!).  I started tearing up when the Hound freaked out at the fire and turned craven. Touching scene between him and Sansa (no, I'm not a SanSan shipper) and adds complexity to his character. Cersei at the end with Tommen and the vial of nightshade, choked me up even though I have read the books but there was still that part of me that wondered. Tyrion was awesome as always and the camera angle of Tywin and Loras at the end was cool. This was the first time my husband and I have done an immediate re-watch of the episode. We'll definetly be re-watching it a few more times this week.  My only minor gripe, is we didn't get a scene with Tyrion bitch-slapping Joffery and he really needed that. :-)Overall, I've enjoyed most of the added stuff this season. Having read all the books, I know what is going to happen so to keep me as a TV viewer interested, I want those added scenes as long as the integrity of the characters and story stay in place.
227	zippypoodle	2012-05-28	My first 10, in two seasons of this show. Every element was pitch-perfect, and no character was written against character. (It helps that the writer was, well, the Author.)This is how you adapt a show for television, departures and all, while remaining faithful to the text. Would that all the episodes had this same fidelity. They all do.
228	Pinn	2012-05-28	Stannis going up the ladder first.  Really?
Never a big fan of rah rah speeches to the troops, even if it was as sardonic as the one delivered by Tyrion. 
Other than that, an excellent episode. 
I particularly liked the maturity that Sansa displayed.  The implicit barbs in her nuanced conversations displays how far she has travelled from her early naivete at beginning of the series.   She also looks better with her hair down.
229	Ghost of Crackclaw	2012-05-28	They all do.Nope! Certainly not this season. Maybe we watched two different shows.
230	Tywin's bastard	2012-05-28	Great episode and they really showed that they had a bigger budget here. A great payoff to what's been built up this far.
Still, I don't think that if you have had criticism against previous episodes you can find things to complain about here as well. I think the knowledge of that GRRM wrote the episode will make some negative people ignore the flaws more though.
The thing that set this episode out from the rest (apart from that it actually had a huge battle, of course) was that it was allowed to follow a single location the entire time. That makes it so much easier to make things flow together.
231	Sydney Losstarot	2012-05-28	It's funny how a lot of people giving this one a 10 or even an 11 if it were possible, still find 'quibbles', some things they didn't completely agree with. And when someone points those very same things, they get picked out, accused of looking for fights. I'm new here and don't know this place much, but still, 8 or 9 is a VERY GOOD grade in my book. This isn't perfect, but it's a very good hour of television, with highlights, and with weaknesses too.
Or maybe this is just a place to rejoice and say this is the best thing that ever graced television, in this case I'm gonna sound like a fun killer. But it's not what I want. Everyone is entitled to his opinion, and I'd rather take the positive approach, and think that all this enthusiasm is positive energy and a good thing.
But still, can't we critic what we don't like? GRRM is NOT an infaillible god.
232	gmavridis	2012-05-28	One of the best episodes of the series. I think everybody would love for GRRM to have the time to write the script. It is the only episode of the second season that is up to the standards of the book. Even the Stannis scene could not overshadow the excellence of the work. Also I think the director did excellent job. The only spot was that anyone who hasn't read the books cannot understand at once the scene with Loras pretending to be Renly.
233	sadfascist	2012-05-28	As many people that are rating this Ten, They are ALL saying, basically, that the episode  could not be better or improved upon.No, what we're saying is that "Blackwater" met and greatly exceeded any reasonable expectations we could have for a budget-constrained adaption of an unfilmable story. And we are saying that, while each individual part may not be perfect, the whole is greater than the parts.Taken within the context of the show (and especially within what is an otherwise lackluster season), GRRM and Neil Marshall delivered an episode that riveted me from the first sweeping shot of Blackwater Bay, all the way through the last note of the closing credits. Did I wish there were more extras? Yes. Did I wish Stannis wore a helmet? Yes. Did I wish Sansa sang a song for the Hound? Yes. But none of it mattered because even if all those things had been true, "Blackwater" could not have been more epic than it already is. A pitch-perfect roller coaster of suspense, terror, awe, exultation, and catharsis.This was a tremendous episode. GOT's finest hour.
234	Cuthbert Allgood	2012-05-28	I loved this episode, but of course I love the series anyway. What's a bit annoying to me is..ok I might be entering troll territory here ..but: I am so sure if we were told this episode was written by someone who isn't GRRM, A LOT of people, -including Elio and Linda - would find so many things to bash. So many DOWNS and not so many TOPS. I can see how this board would be filled with "Cersei would NEVER say that!" "Varys giving a map to Tyrion lol, why do they think they are better writers than GRRM!"  "Sandor and Bronn scene was SO WRONG!"...
My point is..all these people who are now saying "this is how you adapt" are annoying the seven hells out of me. All episodes have this much diversions from the books, or had managed to keep the spirit of books to this degree overall. This episode was not so different than others in terns of adaptation or diversion from books.
235	zippypoodle	2012-05-28	Nope! Certainly not this season. Maybe we watched two different shows.You clearly haven't watched Game of Thrones, I agree.
236	No forum name just yet	2012-05-28	My first post here /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />
I don't want to repeat what was already mentioned a hundred times over...
Just wondering how could 3 steps in a throne room and single line steal the whole show away from Tyrion and Cersei (both performed exceptionally well in this episode).... 
9/10, I'm saving my 10 for the next time we hear about lions and rain /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />
237	Songlian	2012-05-28	10/10.
Rains of Castamere. Rains of friggin Castamere, man.
238	SFA-OK	2012-05-28	7/10. One of the better episodes. Some good, some bad. I thought Cersei, Sansa and Joffrey were all really good as usual. The explosion of the wildfire was really, really well done. The rest of the battle scene had some comical stuff thrown in, IMO, like the top of the guy's head getting chopped off.
Minor gripe, but even with the budget constraints, would it have been too hard to throw in some far away or overhead shots to show more of the boats and Stannis' army? I think it would've just added a nice "epicness" to the battle, which has been missing throughout the show. 
Wasn't a fan of the Sansa/Hound scene. Book version, way better. It's actually one of my favorite parts of the book. I did like the Cersei/Sansa scene, though.
239	gogorath	2012-05-28	I loved this episode, but of course I love the series anyway.

All episodes have this much diversions from the books, or had managed to keep the spirit of books to this degree overall. This episode was not so different than others in terns of adaptation or diversion from books.So very true.  The battle-based adjustments are understandable for the most part.  The chain (and what it would take to make the chain awesome) is beyond prohibitively expensive; Stannis as fighter seems like a level of interest thing likely dictated by the fact that random Baratheon soldiers attacking is kind of boring.But I'm curious to hear why the Hound was made to be nicer, and the interaction with Sansa less sexualized (at least from his POV) than in the books.  Is it merely uncomfortable because Sophie is 16?  Did they think the Hound would come across as completely awful?  I'm not complaining; I always find the (usually very good) reasons interesting.
240	Parise	2012-05-28	a 10 from me. AMAZING!!

All episodes have this much diversions from the books, or had managed to keep the spirit of books to this degree overall. This episode was not so different than others in terns of adaptation or diversion from books.I disagree. The difference between this and the last 3 episodes isn't semantics. Beyond the technical achievements of this episode, it was also superior on a number of levels of keeping to the spirit of the book while changing the details. I'm in a camp that isn't particulary troubled if they a take a different route to get from a A to B (i.e. removing the chain and creating a Wildfire bomb), because the end result still demonstrates Tyrion's ingenuity.Its a fundamentally different issue when Catelyn releases Jamie prior to learning of the deaths of Bran and Rickon. One is driven by absolute desperation and loss and the other by a contrived and far less dramatically satisfying rationale of Karstark's men getting drunk and deciding to kill Jamie.Its apples and oranges.Anyways, I'm still pleasantly suprised with the end result of Blackwater and is has tentatively restored my confidence they can get this show back on track in Season 3.
242	gogorath	2012-05-28	Couple of quick thoughts:
I don't think Lena Headey was nominated for an Emmy by HBO, and I know Blackwater was not submitted (I think, because either it wasn't completely done OR because they didn't want spoilers out there).  
But both are a shame.  I think Lena has outperformed everyone this year -- Dinklage, Dance, Maisie, even Alfie, who has been #2 -- as the script has given her more to do.  I've never thought of her as a great (or poor) actress, but she's really been fantastic this year and I wonder if my prior impression was lack of great roles (I haven't seen her in a ton).
And while this episode wasn't perfect, or even my favorite of the series (Baelor, for me), it was done very well, and it was something never before done on tv.
But, please, stop complaining about scale.  Complain about pace, characters, whatever.  Not scale.  Season one had a lot of scenes that lacked it; the tourney, the hunt, etc.  Most of that was budget.  When you look at this season, the melee, Stannis' fleet, Blackwater... understand that the scale you want and remember from the books may only be really possible with the type of money they aren't going to spend.  Complaining does no good.  99% of networks and producers wouldn't have even ATTEMPTED to show the battle.  Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.
243	AndrA©s Garcia	2012-05-28	This episode was among the most epic and engaging things I've ever seen on television. At the moment, I can't even take seriously the suggestion that this is worth less than a 9 or a 10. It gets the latter score from me. It is one of the brightest highlights from the whole series.
244	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2012-05-28	Only a 10 from me, guys - sorry /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />  (But that's because Ran won't let us vote to 20!)
Nothing more to be said.  Awesome, awesome episode.  Even Shae could do no wrong for me tonight.
My only complaint has nothing to do with the show.  Spare a thought for us here in the UK where the bloody stupid, bollocking, sodding, effin' cretinous commentators on Sky Atlantic talked all over the closing credits and The Rains of Castamere!!  Bastards!
Phew - it's going to take some time to come down from this episode.  I'd better go and plunge into a cold shower or something.
245	JonF311	2012-05-28	Did you miss the Hand's Tourney from season one, where Littlefinger explains it to Sansa?I remember the story from the book, but no I don't recall this in the tourney scene last season Just Littlefinger making some witicisms about Renly and Loras (and showing some creepy interest in Sansa), Gregor cutting his horse's head off, and Robert being drunk. Apparently it was one of those quickie things that if you blinked you missed it.Also, I grasp the budgetary limits and I was NOT disappointed with the wildfire as displayed-- I am still giving the episode a 10.As for Tyron at the gate, I had a sense of "Huh? That's all they had to do? Tip over a boat and cut a couple limbs off?"
246	NeilSpoon	2012-05-28	I just watched it in the UK and will give it a 10-  . The - being for the ending being too sudden for my liking (tywin riding in...."yup, we've won"...... Credits)
Apart from that it was of course perfect. 
What did completely spoiled it for me however, is the fact that SKY Atlantic (basically HBO for the UK) put 4(!) advert blocks in. It completely took away the pace and didn't get the chance to get fully immersed in it.
247	MrDoog	2012-05-28	Absolutely brilliant episode.
I give it a 9.  I think you can only give a 10 if you couldn't possibly improve on anything and as great as this episode was it wasn't 100% perfect. This was after all the most exciting part of CoK to draw from and bring to tv screens so there was some room for improvement but not much.
People here complaining about Stannis being first up the ladder is a bit silly. It was an blatant way of GRRM showing how he and Joffrey are polar opposites... one king hiding behind his mum's skirts while the other is battered and bloody and doesn't even want to retreat even when the day is lost.
And nitpicking on the fact that Stannis wasn't wearing a helmet is even more ridiculous - it's tv for christs sake, the battle is at night and the guy in question is merely a secondary character in a show which has an absolutely massive cast, you have to make the show accessible for those who haven't read the books.
I must say of all 19 episodes so far this was the one I was most looking forward to while at the same time half-dreading in case they screwed it up. It was quality, a strong 9/10.
248	TheRiderThatMounts	2012-05-28	10 out of 10. One of the best episodes in the series so far... Mr. George Martin's influence was clearly visible!
249	Lyana	2012-05-28	It's a 10, yeah it's a 10!!!
That was freakin' awesome! One of the best things I have ever seen on TV (and on screen generally). Loved every single minute of it and the script was amazing. 
The voting scale must be increased. 10 is just not enough anymore /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
250	Rapsie	2012-05-28	9/10 Truly amazing. Season 2 had been a bit of a let down recently, but this episode was fabulous. Between Stannis and Davos, Jaime and Brienne and Arya/Sandor, it looks like there will be some good scenes for the next season.
251	Ditocorto	2012-05-28	best episode ever or best episode ever? 10/10 for me
252	Ogamoose	2012-05-28	Great episode. I gave it a 9 only because I thought the chains might have added another "cruncher" to the wildfire explosion. But very well adapted indeed overall. Sansa showed a little spine (at last) and Joffrey's cravenness came through nicely.
This episode just saved the season for me.
253	ipsuel	2012-05-28	10 from me... brilliant episode... brilliant TV in general... 
Just freak'n amazing!
254	Hasfast	2012-05-28	Ok, I read five pages straight of comments. Agree with most and strongly disagree with others. As for my personal opinion, this episode extremely ROCKED!!It's been a while since I concluded that, unlike the first season, which clearly seemed to have been made more like a close adaptation of the novel, with many parts even strictly resembling the actual scenes as described in the book, this season sets off its own path, and is as much a complement to the original work as it is an adaptation of it. We see characters and events much more developed and/or interpreted from different angles. In the book, Stannis is rather absent from this battle, merely mentioned. Even later, his leading the siege is referenced only vaguely. In here, we see part of what he did (And we can take it for cannon. Martin himself wrote this, after all).Those who judge too harshly should actually be opening themselves to the perspectives of events already related in the books, because most of the times, we only have one, two at best. This battle probably has the most POVs involved in any scene of the books, with Davos, Sansa and Tyrion all providing feedback to what's going on, but that's a rare case (The only one I can remember).To those who actually believe this was a cheap battle scene... well... you should either stop watching the series or start taking it for what it is: a TV show, with limited budget (With which they've been doing seriously HELL OF A JOB, particularly in this episode). Odd, that readers of fantasy have such a hard time opening their minds to interpretations. Purism in fiction is... rather antithesis, I think.I absolutely loved this episode, and have loved the season ever since I decided to play by its rules and not the books'. I encourage all who still have trouble with the series, to do the same. D.R.
255	Eye.H8.Sansa	2012-05-28	This is an overall good episode.  I would have given it a higher rating but there was too much Sansa and Cersei in there.  I can't stand Sansa Stark.  I actually like Shae the whore more than Sansa.
256	Owdoo	2012-05-28	It was a pity the chain was left out, but I was awed by the wildfire explosion scenes.
And I have to say I found it a bit of a stretch to believe that Stannis was first up the ladder with no protection on his head when defenders are throwing rocks and raining arrows down from the battlements.  I get that it's tv and the main characters have to be recognisable but surely there is a compromise somewhere which is a bit closer to what might really happen in such a situation.  It doesn't have to be a full face helm.  Same goes for the hound, wouldn't his helm make him very recognisable anyway?
That said I think the second half of this 2nd season has been much stronger than the first half, and Blackwater continued the improving trend. Overall I thought they did a good job with the budget they had available and I enjoyed the episode a lot.  9/10.
Oh and the Rains of Castamere song was cool too.  Shame the Sky continuity announcer in the UK decided to spoil the atmosphere of the closing credits version by speaking over it.
257	Dacie	2012-05-28	10.
Exceeded my expectations. Brilliant episode.
258	AegonIV	2012-05-28	Definitely enjoyed the episode and on the whole I like the choices that were made regarding deviations from the books.
However I do believe that Tyrion's chain could and should have been included.  A set up in an earlier episode - Tyrion telling all the smith's in King's landing to begin constructing large links and assembling them would be enough to plant the concept in the viewers' minds and then the pay off would be manifested by simply showing men on either side of the Blackwater towing it out of the water at the signal.  Men on the ships would only then have to report that an enormous chain was preventing escape. Not perfect, but it certainly could be done without an enormous increase in budget IMO.  I could be wrong...
But this is a critical story/character point.  It makes Tyrion look like a masterful tactician and prevents Davos from looking somewhat foolish.  An empty ship approaching an armada has got to raise suspicions in any competent commander particularly one who has survived using his wits to avoid being trapped or bought by surprise.
Deal breaker?  Nah.  Still a great episode.
259	Caio T	2012-05-28	10/10
So many great things about this episode:
The freaking Hound!! Finally he had a big space in an ep., his scenes was great, especially the one he turned away from the battle. ("fk the king" yea)
I was susprised when I saw Stannis leading the attack, that was unexpected. Melisandre must have put some weird Asshai magic to protect him /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' /> (weird that she didn't appear).  Didn't like the way he was dragged when it was lost though.
Cersei was great this episode, I knew how that was going to end but I got really scared when she was about to poison Tommen. One moment she was about to poison her son and 10 second later she was so happy hugging him.
Tyrion turned out to be a nice commender after all. HALFMAN HALFMAN HALFMAN. I didn't realise at first that it was his father he was looking at when he was fainting. And Podrick was so brutal he broke the spear /stunned.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':stunned:' />
The only thing I really missed was already mentioned a few times, it was when Loras got to battle, they should be shouting "RENLY" or something like this, so it would look like Renly himself was leading the attack. Did anyone noticed the look on Cersei's face after Loras showed himself to her? She looked really scared, she didn't seem to know which side was he on.
260	Reposado	2012-05-28	a million out of ten. amazing in every aspect. just well crafted television. may be one of my favorite episodes of anything, ever,
261	Akisut84	2012-05-28	Ok, this episode was as the whole series should have been. Perfect. My mind was blown. And the guy who wrote the script really knows something aboult writing. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' /> I hope he is going to write the scripts of every episodes of season 3.
262	Fez	2012-05-28	Well god damn if that wasn't something. That's a 10/10 (but... this one goes to 11!). So, so much to love even without all the added suspense that I'm sure non-readers must've felt about how things might turn out.  I loved or at least really liked just about every episode of the series thus far (with maybe 2 misfires) so I don't want to say this one blew them out of the water, but in a way it really, really did. It elevated the show to a whole other place through some combination of GRRM's script, Marshall's directing, the extra budget, and the catharsis of 18 and a 1/2 episodes worth of tension being broken in 25 brutal, wonderful minutes.
I think my favorite scene though is one that I'm not seeing mentioned much, it was just the short tracking shots before and after Bronn/Tyrion (itself a great bit) and before Tyrion and Sansa started talking (also great): just seeing men rushing through a throne room completely empty except for those massive braziers to head towards the walls. For some reason it was then (despite already knowing the battle was going to be shown) that it just hit me that, holy fuck, this is actually going to go down and it is going to be awesome.
Also, enough good stuff can't ever be said about Stannis. I wasn't really a fan of BookStannis until ADWD but since I did end up a fan I was more readily on his side earlier this season. These past two episodes though, it doesn't matter what preconceptions I had about him, I am forever and always on ShowStannis' side. 
	Spoiler I do hope though that he sets sail for The Wall by the end of season 3, even if you don't know that's where he's headed yet. I don't think I could stand more than a whole season of him just hanging around Dragonstone. (though the snails (was it snails?) in the fire scene should be good).

Oh and the Blackwater on fire has (at least temporarily) replaced Discworld being carried through the cosmos by the Great A'Tuin as my desktop background.
263	lostinwesteros	2012-05-28	Just cruising through to see if there were any votes lower than a 10.  Some surprise, but I see most are hugging 10 pretty closely.  Then, there are those of us who would give it a definite 11 on that scale of 10.  Me, I could go up to a 15, at least!
264	packersfan	2012-05-28	I gave a 9.  Really only a few complaints, haha.  I was under the impression that the battle occurred during the day or at least the sun was rising as "the ghost of Renly" saved the day for King's Landing.  Thinking about it though, I see two reasons for making the battle at night: 1. Increased effect of fire and wildfire! 2. Can "hide" more soldiers in the darkness, thus not requiring a TON of extras or CGI.
I wonder if they got rid of the whole CHAIN across the bay or if that will be elaborated on in the next episode as Davos and Stannis attempt to escape to safety.
Obviously due to budget restraints??? they eliminated the awesome sounding ship to ship fighting where in the books actually Tyrion is attacked by the kingsguardsman and Pod saves him.  Thankfully this episode did not introduce any drastic plot diversions from the books...since Martin himself wrote this episode, he stayed pretty faithful to his own work, haha.
I was going to criticize the opening scene with Bronn and the Hound as just another chance to show boobs, but the scene actually worked and wasn't just wasted camera time for HBO smut, unlike earlier scenes this season.
Those are my criticisms, but on a whole this episode was the best of the season, even though it had a low-budget feel to it (besides the wildfire)!
265	GSP	2012-05-28	Gave it a ten, cause that's all that I was allowed to give.
Awesome adaptation. Bridge of burning ships would have been cool but prohibitively expensive, I get it.
Damn I wish they had a boundless budget!
266	Ser Mixalot	2012-05-28	10.  Loved this episode.   Also have to give credit to the actor who plays Joffrey.   Everyone hates him and that means hes doing his job well.  I could almost feel the heat coming off the television during the wildfire scene.  Nasty stuff!  The back and forth between the chaos of battle and Cersei worked really well too.  Excellent job.
The Rains of Castamere during the credits was brilliant.
267	CrownedStag	2012-05-28	This was a fantastic episode, that EXPLOSION was immense. Peter Dinklage deserves an oscar (I know its not a movie but he desreves it anyway). The fear and emotion ("what have I done") he showed when he saw the wildfire reek havoc was brilliant. Bravo!
Varys, the Hound, Bronn, Sansa, Cersei etc were also brilliantly portrayed in this episode.
I give it a 9.5/10
268	rmholt	2012-05-29	But still, can't we critic what we don't like? GRRM is NOT an infaillible god.There is a thread for criticism without flaming.I want to know why NO ONE has given it a two.
269	Kashmir	2012-05-29	I can't wait for the season finale, but I don't know how it can top this.I don't know either, but having heard that it will be a somewhat extended episode, I'm already looking forward to it..... who am I kidding, I've been looking forward to it since episode 1.
270	bardgal	2012-05-29	Couple of quick thoughts:I don't think Lena Headey was nominated for an Emmy by HBO, and I know Blackwater was not submitted (I think, because either it wasn't completely done OR because they didn't want spoilers out there).  But both are a shame.  I think Lena has outperformed everyone this year -- Dinklage, Dance, Maisie, even Alfie, who has been #2 -- as the script has given her more to do.  I've never thought of her as a great (or poor) actress, but she's really been fantastic this year and I wonder if my prior impression was lack of great roles (I haven't seen her in a ton).And while this episode wasn't perfect, or even my favorite of the series (Baelor, for me), it was done very well, and it was something never before done on tv.But, please, stop complaining about scale.  Complain about pace, characters, whatever.  Not scale.  Season one had a lot of scenes that lacked it; the tourney, the hunt, etc.  Most of that was budget.  When you look at this season, the melee, Stannis' fleet, Blackwater... understand that the scale you want and remember from the books may only be really possible with the type of money they aren't going to spend.  Complaining does no good.  99% of networks and producers wouldn't have even ATTEMPTED to show the battle.  Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.This season's Emmy nomination process isn't over until May 31st, 2012. So every episode (including the last one - IF it's webcast - due to the Hanging Episode rule) will be eligible for nomination for the 64th Emmy Awards. So, let's hope more of the Television Academy members will have seen this season. I agree with you x âˆ<U+009E>Â3 about people complaining about scale.
271	bardgal	2012-05-29	Only a 10 from me, guys - sorry /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />  (But that's because Ran won't let us vote to 20!)Nothing more to be said.  Awesome, awesome episode.  Even Shae could do no wrong for me tonight.My only complaint has nothing to do with the show.  Spare a thought for us here in the UK where the bloody stupid, bollocking, sodding, effin' cretinous commentators on Sky Atlantic talked all over the closing credits and The Rains of Castamere!!  Bastards!Phew - it's going to take some time to come down from this episode.  I'd better go and plunge into a cold shower or something.OMG. What IDIOTS. I am so sorry!
272	bardgal	2012-05-29	I remember the story from the book, but no I don't recall this in the tourney scene last season Just Littlefinger making some witicisms about Renly and Loras (and showing some creepy interest in Sansa), Gregor cutting his horse's head off, and Robert being drunk. Apparently it was one of those quickie things that if you blinked you missed it.Go here, and skip to 1:22. You'd have to blink for over a minute to miss it.Definitely enjoyed the episode and on the whole I like the choices that were made regarding deviations from the books.However I do believe that Tyrion's chain could and should have been included.

An empty ship approaching an armada has got to raise suspicions in any competent commander particularly one who has survived using his wits to avoid being trapped or bought by surprise.Deal breaker?  Nah.  Still a great episode.1. The show is quoted (even in the "Previously on Battlestar Galactica" of this episode) that wildefire "burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel." So why would it not destroy the chain - oh yeah, if we leave it underwater - but then it's a night scene, so how do they film that? 2. Why would Tyrion waste two ships and the men on them to wildfire just to pull a chain (since there is no Star Trek transporter in Westeros to magically get them out of the massive river full of wildfire that doesn't magically not go past the chain) and have those ships not able to hold the chain in place because they're also destroyed by wildfire, when the massive wildfire bomb that happened in this episode makes Tyrion look even smarter than he did in the book?3. It's at night. In the fog. They don't see it's only one ship until it's almost upon them, and then can't see that it's unmanned until they're right next to it. There are no motors, or oars on these ships. There is no forward, reverse, or neutral. There is no ship to ship satellite radio to tell the other ships anything. There's only sails and a tiller. And I'm not sure if you've ever sailed yourself, but once you get inertia on water in a ship/boat controlled only by wind power, there is no stopping, only steering, furling sail, coming about (which isn't fast in a ship that size), and rope on a cleat for a break - but you need a dock for that. The scene as written in ASoS, is unfilmable. What they accomplished in this episode is stellar, and never before done for television. It's groundbreaking. I wish more people could understand that.As has been said before, but bears infinitly repeating: We've been given a show that is by and large unproducable for the screen. Start there in your mind. We're so damn lucky to be getting as brilliant, and perfectly cast a show as this! I don't care who writes the episodes. I love every last one of them.

273	Patchface Is AA Reborn	2012-05-29	Fantastic episode. Strange that any changes from the novel or plot points that didnt make sense this week get a pass because of the writer. The other writers for this show cant buy a bucket on this site. Im sure that next week because the writer isnt named George any changes made wont make sense and  will be nitpicked to death and some characters will be forever ruined.

274	Buster	2012-05-29	I'm guessing that George didn't have complete freedom when writing the episode. He had to write the episode so that it fit the changes that have already been made and probably had to add stuff that David and Dan wanted. An example of this would be Stannis on the front lines. I still don't like all the changes and wish that the show was an exact copy of the books, but George created this world and even if he did choose to change things himself, it's his world and he can do whatever he wants with it. That is the reason why other writers changing things for no reason is worse than George doing it. They didn't create the world and therefore don't have any authority over it.

We're so damn lucky to be getting as brilliant, and perfectly cast a show as this! I don't care who writes the episodes. I love every last one of them.The chain was pulled up from the bottom of the river by two winch towers on opposite banks of the Blackwater.  As I mentioned in my original post, you could easily allude to the chain without actually showing it in the river - the audience would know there was a chain by the earlier set up and then demonstrating the winching/rising of the chain at the riverside and then having the sailers/soldiers realize (through panic and dialogue) that there's no escape.The fog still works to the plan's advantage but to count on it as an essential part of the plan seems sloppy as it wouldn't necessarily be a given.The show was still great, I just thought that this one aspect of Martin's original material was particularly clever and should have been included.  YMMV
276	Ser Pink of Floyd	2012-05-29	In one vast swoop of Sandors sword, that episode made me forget every complaint ive had with this series, sure it wasnt *quite* like the book, but as far as bringing the best of Blackwater to the TV screens, the did it with stunning results.
It was directed well, produced brilliantly and very well written.
I have no real complaints to add, except for the need for ad breaks!!
277	White Raven	2012-05-29	10/10
Best episode this season.
Any complaints are just tiny nitpicks, like there should have been more wildfire involved in the battle after the first big explosion.
278	Leto Atreides	2012-05-29	I give it a 7,
I liked the scenes inside King's Landing and the wildfire but not so much the battle. It never looked to me like Stannis' army had a chance to take the city. Even when Joffrey says "There's too many of them!", all we see are a couple or rowboats reaching the walls. The whole battle was poorly shot and edited in my opinion. Why did they put so much focus on CGI gore effects like people getting chopped in half? Because of the limited budget, they should have made Stannis' army breach the mud gate and have Tyrion lead the last defense past the gate to save the city. When all seems lost, they could have finally shown Tywin and Loras charging the rear of Stannis forces to break the siege.
279	Ran	2012-05-29	None of the guys chopped in half effects were CG. They were practical effects.
280	David Selig	2012-05-29	9/10. First 10 minutes were pretty mediocre, the Bron - Hound was a bore. After that it was great, with a really fantastic final scene.
281	J_Crews	2012-05-29	9/10. First 10 minutes were pretty mediocre, the Bron - Hound was a bore. After that it was great, with a really fantastic final scene.Dude, I loved that scene
282	Qhorin Halfhand and Yoren	2012-05-29	Best episode of the season. If only there was a way to create multiple Martins where we have one of them writing the books and the other all the episodes...

284	jamesellaby	2012-05-29	Hi everyone, here's my review from my site, I've been reviewing season 2 episode-by-episode (I've never read the books, which might be obvious from my reviews!) http://www.newadvent...isode-9-review/
thanks
James
285	Greywolf2375	2012-05-29	Watched it a few times, to me it wasn't a "perfect episode".  It was however far greater than the sum of its parts.
The acting was the best they've had - it was like everyone was given their draught of acting +5.
the writing was the best they've had - it was like, well, GRRM wrote it.  fancy that.
the imagery was the best they've had - the ships in the dark, views from the castle walls, Bronn's arrow...that wildfire thing.
the action was the most they've had - there were quick cuts and maybe one too many people being split like firewood, but hey - this is slightly "fantastical".
Are there gripes?  Sure...it looks like after Bronn and The Hound had their stare down that Cersei brought her entourage into the same room.  One single ship and no reaction to it?  Too many people being cut in half.  A few too many quick cuts in scenes that made it jump around.
It was not a "perfect epsiode".  Whatever that means.
it was perfect for me.  10.
edit: not too shabby, a 9.55 rating average so far.

286	Lady Lilac	2012-05-29	There were some issues especially during the fighting scenes, but over all it was by far the best of the season, so 10/10.
287	WildlingGirl	2012-05-29	Definitely a 10 and epic, and a lot of foreshadowing. I was blown away by the wildfire explosion, Sansa behaving like a queen yet seeking comfort in the spurned doll, Cersei's story to Tommen on the iron throne, Tyrion's sortie... yet forgot to look crestfallen when Tyrion's face was sliced so my viewer bf understood he's not dead. Oh well /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
288	goonerjon777	2012-05-29	well i thought it was fabulous, too many people on here are far too critical, its a tv adaptation for christs sake not a hollywood block buster.
my highlights:-
i was in awe of the wildfire
cersei was brilliant
the hound came in to his own.
can't wait for grrm to write more episodes, well played sir.
289	Ogamoose	2012-05-29	It's weird how any rating less than 10, not even an 8 or a 9, is deemed "too critical". Wow! Easy folks.
290	redriver	2012-05-29	10.Great episode.Not sure it's my favourite though but it's close.
291	The Ragged Man	2012-05-29	9.5! Too bad George didn't write all the episodes.
292	Tadco26	2012-05-29	As someone who has been disappointed by this season as a whole, I thought this episode was great and the only 10 I have given for this season.  Any minor nitpicks or scenes I was hoping to see that didn't make it were minor enough not to detract at all.  Granted I would love for them to have a Lord of the Rings movie budget to do the battles, but given the budget constraints I thought it was awesome.  A virtually perfect example of how to do an adaptation and still stick very close to how the book story plays out. 
The extremely minor things I missed:
1) no chain, which in the context of the show at this point made sense.  No way they could have built the chain in that length of time since they hadn't mentioned it in previous episodes and I imagine it would be very hard to make it visible in a night scene anyway.  Plus it would have made Davos look like an idiot to lead them into the chained off bay when he was the one pointing out the flaws in not sending ahead scouts in the books and noting the new towers which held the chain. 
2)  Sansa and the Hound's scene didn't quite make it clear why she refused to leave with him since she said he wouldn't hurt her, when if I remember correctly she was quite afraid of him at that point in the book.  Didn't force her to sing to him.  I know some non-readers seem to be confused on if she went with him or not and have made comments that she is an idiot if she did not, which it's hard to argue with in the context of the show.
3)  It threw me off slightly for the Hound to directly refuse Joffrey's order.  Refusing Tyrion was one thing, refusing Joffrey in the manner he did seems it would have gotten him killed or at least some reaction from the other soldiers and king's guard rather than just let him walk off.
Like I said exteremely minor things that were more expectations than complaints.  Outside the context of this particular episode I wonder about what they are doing with Ser Dontas and if any non-readers will even remember who he is by the time he shows up again.
293	A Redeemed Hound	2012-05-29	Had to give it a 10.  It was almost flawless.  My one minor complaint is WHY DIDN'T THE HOUND WEAR HIS HOUND HELMET?  THAT IS THE COOLEST HELMET EVER!!!!  He never wears the f'ing thing.  Should have worn it when he rescued Sansa a few weeks ago too!!!
Other than that, GRRM should now be forced to write every episode and Neil Marshal must direct them all as well.  There was such a quality difference with the cast and writing for Episode 10.  The wild fire scene was jaw dropping.  And Sansa was also awesome.  My mother can't believe they killed tyrion.  He he he.

He he he.R.M. said the reason he doesn't wear the Hound Helmet is because it is too hard to see out of when fighting.   Didn't want to injure anyone during filming the scenes.Also, a few folks asked me today if Tyrion was dead . . . good adaptation with Ser Moore.
295	kirazikins	2012-05-29	Absolutely brilliant!! I loved everything about it!! Yes, some things were missing (the chain, sansa's song to the hound) but I really enjoyed it still!! I had goosebumps throughout all of it!!!
296	bardgal	2012-05-29	In one vast swoop of Sandors sword, that episode made me forget every complaint ive had with this series, sure it wasnt *quite* like the book, but as far as bringing the best of Blackwater to the TV screens, the did it with stunning results.It was directed well, produced brilliantly and very well written.I have no real complaints to add, except for the need for ad breaks!!Ad breaks? You need ad breaks? Or where you are has ad breaks? If it's the latter I'm wondering where is that, that shows GoT WITH ad breaks? /shocked.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':shocked:' />
297	A Redeemed Hound	2012-05-29	I just hope next week is as brilliant as this week.  I have my doubts.  I really hope the House of the Undying is as awesome and mysterious and trippy as it is in the books.  If they do it right it will make up for a rather lame Qarth this season.
298	Spidey	2012-05-29	9.5! Too bad George didn't write all the episodes.I'd rather have him write TWoW.
299	gogorath	2012-05-29	It's weird how any rating less than 10, not even an 8 or a 9, is deemed "too critical". Wow! Easy folks.I think most of this is cause by the fact that we all have a different scale of what 1-10 means.What's the comparison set?  All TV?  Other HBO series?  Just elite TV like Mad Men, The Wire, The Sopranos, Breaking Bad?  Just things I watch?  The emotion you felt when you read the books?  Full scale Hollywood movies?What's the criteria for a 10?  Someone previously said it has to be perfect for it to be a ten - kind of the gymnastics type of judging.  Others don't start at a 10 and subtract -- they allow for positives to completely outweigh negatives if the positives are awesome enough to them. What are you grading and what's your focus?  Fidelity to the books?  Execution by the filmmakers and acting?  Just the emotional impact it has on you? For me, it's really hard to see someone seeing this as an "8" based on how I grade.  For a television show, the battle execution was unprecented.  If this battle was an eight, what does a show have to do to get a 10 portraying a battle?  But perhaps someone else just doesn't care for battles, so it's hard for me to see the grade until I realize they really don't care about that.  And while I thought there were things to be improved, no episode would get a ten if I did the gymnastic-style judging -- so I don't -- but some do.  And that's fine, even if that means 10s are hard to come by.  But for me, the battle scenes were so much better than I felt we had a right to expect, plus I thought the Cersei scenes were great, as were Tyrion's.  The Sansa-Hound scene was just okay to me and the end was (deliberately?) a bit confusing, but that was all well overcome for me by the awesomeness.We may actually agree on a lot of individual points, but may come up with different grades.  And that's before even getting to places where people differ on how well it was done, period.  But since each of us assumes our way of grading is superior, your "8" is freaking CRAZY.  /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
300	drm7	2012-05-29	I rated it a 9, but it was actually more like a 9.49999 than a 8.500001. (I thought that "Baelor" was the only 10.)
Stunning, visceral episode. Easily the best of the season. Lena Headey was awesome.
I knew that the episode was done "right" when my heart actually leapt seeing Loras and Tywin burst into the throne room. I was shocked at my reaction. Why am I cheering for Tywin Lannister? Damn you, Mr. Martin!!
(Oh, and the green explosion was off-the-charts incredible!)
Only very minor quibbles:
1) I know that Stannis is a psycho control freak, but personally climbing a ladder up the wall? (Stephen Dillane is incredible, though)
2) San/San would have been better had it stuck closer to the books. I don't think that it would have added shooting time and/or budget, so I'm puzzled that the producers and the...ahem...writer took some of the "juice" out of the scene.
301	jdp13	2012-05-29	Amazing how well action scenes can work when you're invested in the characters.  Sounds easy enought but it rarely happens.  Great episode.
302	Franz95	2012-05-29	I loved it. Stannis's battle face was wpic, Sandor's scared one impressive. And I admit I've shouted "Halfman, halfman", along with the Kingslanders... oh, and "The Rains of Castamere"? Awesome.
303	BigWhy	2012-05-29	Very good episode. An 8+ from me.
The Wildfire explosions were well done, well and above most everything thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s been done in a TV series.
Rains of Castamere !
The Cersei + Tommen scene on the throne was chilling.
The scene with Sansa comforting the ladies after Cersei left, perfect. Maisie Williams gets a lot of (deserved) praise for her Arya, Sophie Turner is just as good with Sansa, in an arguably more difficult role.
A few quibbles to explain the 8:
:
As always, some unecessary scenes : Cersei questioning Shae (why would her Grace care about a maid, and this in the middle of a battle?). Bronn and the Hound squaring off, silly.
I felt the Sansa + Hound scene was missing a little something. At least they didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t skip it.
Ilyn Payne still looks ridiculous.
Stannis fronting the attack. Wearing no helmet. -.-

304	sarah.jenice	2012-05-29	Absolutely a 10! I've already watched it 4 times.
305	gmavridis	2012-05-29	That, ladies and gentlemen, is how you write the show. Changes? Yes. Characters remaining within the paradigm of what the showrunners have defined (Cersei and Sandor, most notably)? Yep. But it all actually clicks together.My biggest beefs: I wish they didn't have to Hollywoodize Stannis and have him swinging his sword in the forefront, but okay, you want to give him an action moment, I guess. And I wish someone had been shouting, "Renly!" and you'd see the guys in Renly's kit still throwing down their swords or turning on their own.But... uh. Those complaints, they are minor.I just confirmed with friends and family all no readers that they did not understand the scene with "Renly". Most of them did not even notice Loras and they thought that Tywin was the one that won the battle. Everything else was perfect.
306	bardgal	2012-05-29	Some insight on how this episode was shot:http://insidetv.ew.c...s-blackwater-2/
307	TyrionTargaryen	2012-05-29	I knew that the episode was done "right" when my heart actually leapt seeing Loras and Tywin burst into the throne room. I was shocked at my reaction. Why am I cheering for Tywin Lannister? Damn you, Mr. Martin!!I thought the same thing! Tywin was like "The battle is over. And we have won!"Now I know what it was like for Darth Vader when his 'thoughts betrayed him'. I guess I was rooting for Tyrion the whole time but Davos is right there as one of my favorites. Can't wait to see him on the Merlin rocks or whatever they are called.
308	TyrionTargaryen	2012-05-29	Absolutely a 10! I've already watched it 4 times.I've watched it about 8 times already... it is insanely addicting. I barely worked today but watched HBOGO.com hahaha
309	Lady of Long Lake	2012-05-29	Sansa: I'll pray for your safetyTyrion: You will?Sansa: Just as I do for Joffrey...OUCH!Loved the episode, obviously some small deviations but very well done.Having watched the Sandor Sansa scene, I don't get why she would choose not to go with a him when he is not drunk, scary, and offers to take her home...But that's minor I guess.I really want to hear all of the Rains of Castamere at one time now!Wait! I'm pretty sure Sansa said she would pray for the KING. That would be Robb or Stannis, my dear Stargaryen:)  Sansa would not pray for Joff. Tyrion got a slightly amused look so I think he knew what she meant.
310	Lady of Long Lake	2012-05-29	9/10. First 10 minutes were pretty mediocre, the Bron - Hound was a bore. After that it was great, with a really fantastic final scene.I was thinking the same thing David when I was watching it. Why the hell are they wasting precious time in the Blackwater episode showing us naked chicks in a bar?But it made some weird sense after Sandor had his meltdown. He was 2 seconds away from being killed by the flaming guy when Bronn shot him. Bronn gives him a shit eating grin and nods, like "Don't worry, I got your back Big Guy". The guy he was going to kill in the bar 5 minutes ago saves his life whilest he's frozen with fear. It added to Sandor's unraveling scene, I think.
311	Ditocorto	2012-05-30	btw stannis suddenly became a HUGE BADASS: "we're too far from the gates, hundreds will die!" "Thousands"
312	ICE CROW	2012-05-30	Ran,
After reading your analysis there is something I must mention, im not sure if anyone else has mentioned it yet so I will. You talked about how the final Sandor/Sansa scene was missing something that happened in the book the giving of his Kingsguard whitecloak, the thing is she already has it!. In the scene where Sansa is being stripped by Ser Meryn and Tyrion comes in and saves her from further abuse, Sandor is the one who rips of his cloak and gives it to Sansa, she then leaves with it. From that scene on, Sandor no longer has a whitecloak in any other scenes. So Sansa does have Sandor's whitecloak to remember him by in the future.
Obviously different then how it happened in the book but we end up with the same result.
EDIT: i just double checked there is only one scene after the throne room scene where Sandor is wearing a whitecloak, the scene where Sansa thanks him for saving her. I think this was a continuity error more than anything, because except for that scene he never wears a cloak again after giving her his. No matter what though, she does have one of Sandors whitecloaks which is what is important.

316	Silverjaime	2012-05-30	The acting was superb throughout, the special effects were excellent, I can't even decide which scene I liked best - Bron firing the arrow, Cersie's drunken nastiness, Tyrion taking charge, Stannis fighting on no matter what his men do, Sansa saying "you won't hurt ME", etc etc......!
George's dialogue was spot on, lots of wit and memorable lines from everyone.
Season two started off quite disappointingly IMO but this episode was probably one of the best hours of TV I've ever seen! 
How are they gonna follow that??!!
317	Turkey Jack	2012-05-30	My expectations are obviously too high.  The blackwater was the best part of the books flicking from one Point of view to another added to the tensions, watching Stannis lead the attack with no shield or helm broke the immersion for me and I could not take it seriously.  (how he manages to get from the battlements through the enemy and back to his ship I have no idea)
The wildfire seen was amazing - the fighting on the river was shortened for obvious reasons, but I think Sandor gets a bit of a raw deal as  retreats at the first sign of fire.  Tyrion leading the attack on foot (much cheaper in an already expensive episode) also defies common sense, not to mention the coolest kill in the books is Ser Mandon first written charge.
Non combat sections where well done although Sandor Bronn was a little odd unless there will be a future arc to come out of it,
318	phedre	2012-05-30	I have to rate it a 10, I've already re-watched it twice!
Totally lived up to expectations, and the dialogue was absolutely brilliant. We had to rewind/rewatch the 'tell the hound to tell the hand' several times right away, we were laughing so hard!
319	Slingingstones	2012-05-30	I think most of this is cause by the fact that we all have a different scale of what 1-10 means.I must agree.  In the Orient, being a number 10 is NOT a good thing.
320	Uknownothing	2012-05-30	I have to agree with most of the posters.  I thought the episode was excellent- easily one of the best in the series.  I thought the battle scenes were very well produced, and I find that Leena Hadley is really making me hate Cersei a lot less than I did when I read the books.  Her scene with Tommen on the Iron Throne was great.  I am sad that the season is almost over and it will be months before we get to start again.
321	tfoxx22	2012-05-30	Definitely a great episode.. 9-10
322	Glyndwr	2012-05-31	The sheer volume & scale of the books makes it impossible to adhere perfectly to every character & story arc in a TV conversion the same way as Peter Jackson's LOTR movies veered of in places but 17 oscars cant be wrong...!!!!
GRRM's input was evident even in the "changed" scenes & all in all it made for some amazing viewing and when Bronn was singing "the Rains of Castamere" it really was a goosebump moment. I have even found myself liking the Lannisters a bit lately..........!!!!
323	ServantOnIce	2012-06-01	I've watched this episode five times . .   that says it all . .
324	Lady of Long Lake	2012-06-01	a million out of ten. amazing in every aspect. just well crafted television. may be one of my favorite episodes of anything, ever,I agree:) It was the best so far.
325	Lord Tywin	2012-06-02	9.5/10.
Oddly, Lena Headey (sp.?) made this episode for me. As far as I'm concerned, she's now joined Dance, Dinklage, Cosmo and maybe a couple of others at the head of the class in a series that features generally strong acting all around. I don't know what she did between seasons 1 & 2, but she's really brought it this year.
This whole season has seemed really dark (as in the picture quality, not the thematic tone). Since this one happened exclusively at night, it was hard for me to make out some things. I have perfect eyesight, but perhaps my environment or my tv is not-so-perfect (although it's been the same on my lcd monitor). The battle scenes were especially murky. Or was that intentional? It wouldn't be unreasonable if it were.
That aside, my only quibbles are Stannis the Barbarian charging up the ladder with no protection, the Sandor-Sansa scene lacked intensity or a reason for her to stay in King's Landing (and what's happened to Dontos?), the lack of an Imp Chain, and Tyrion's wounding. Ser Mandon is supposed to slip before striking, hence his botched assassination attempt, and there appeared to be no reason for him to only slice across Tyrion's face. Again, I could have just missed something due to the darkness, though.
I couldn't see a reason for it at first, but by the end I thought the Sandor-Bronn scene was  just meant to re-emphasize that the Hound is bold enough to challenge Bronn, so his "fuck the king" scene wasn't just him being a chicken shit when the going gets tough. That illustration would be more for non-GRRM readers, since other viewers would know exactly why he leaves.
GRRM's reaction to any claims that the writer of this episode doesn't know jack about Westeros would be priceless.

326	stahrlili	2012-06-03	I rated this a 10!!! It deserves it's rating ... my palms and heart was racing throughout the whole dang episode!!! Lol. I've had to wipe my hands (((on my husband's arm lol))) a few times. I read a little bit about the Blackwater Bay Battle in FF and I've read about Sansa and Sandor's scene, slightly disappointed that she never sang to him and that they put the singing of the song while she was in the Keep with all the women and children...got over it though lol.
327	Princess of the Night	2012-06-05	Loved it.
The best episode of Game of Thrones, so far.
328	LordDolorousEdd	2012-06-06	It was fantastic!!!!!!!!!! only change I would have made would have tywin rid into the hall at the end would have looked awesome!!!
329	lemoncurd	2012-06-09	Rains of Castsmere during the credits made me cry...I choked up when Tywin entered the gate and then that Rains of Castamere just let all the tears flow! I've already read the books but I can't help but feel the panic, the despair--and even sympathy for the Lannisters!--oh my god I don't use this word but THAT EPISODE WAS EPIC.Also, how many weeks late am I watching this episode???
330	LostSoul	2012-06-29	Best episode of the whole season. Loved every moment, Tyrion clearly stole the show for me...brilliant masterpiece of the makers...
331	Alex7s	2012-07-06	one word....WOW!
It wasnt like the wildfire i imagined. hahaha I gave a loud gasp! poor Davos </3 and the ending WAS EPIC!! great episode! great actors!
332	Queen of Whores	2012-10-22	Gave it a 7, nearly an 8.
Pros:
Wildfire
Atmosphere
Sandor
Stannis
Rains of Castermere
Cons:
Lack of scale
Cuts to conversation at bad times
Rushed ending
333	King Tyrion I	2013-01-13	10/10
Just damn perfect.
Bronn, Sansa, the Hound, Tyrion, Cersei and even Joffrey. Brilliant acting. /thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' />
334	Theda Baratheon	2013-01-15	10.
I remember first watching this on TV and just being absolutely awe-struck. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING EPISODE. One of the best pieces of television you  will ever see.

335	Nox the Blackblade	2013-01-21	10/10 The action was great, the wildfire was great, and Cersei was completely smashed. To bad Tyrion got the short end of the stick. (No pun intended.) And of course, two of my favorite lines in the series:
"Those are brave men knocking at our door! Let's go kill them!" Tyrion Lannister.
"F&*k the kingsguard, F&*k the city, F&*k the king!" Sandor Cligane, the Hound.
336	SeanF	2013-03-07	I've just got the DVD of Season 2, and I've watched it twice.
I'd have to give it a 10.
Martin is absolutely right in his commentary about how the bells ringing wildly ratchet up the tension.  You can feel the panic and fear sweeping the City, and imagine women and children seeking refuge in the Septs.
The Highlights:-
1.  Varys' rather moving comments about his hatred for the Dark Arts, and how Tyrion is their only hope.
2.  The dialogue between Davos and Matthos.
.3  The wildfire explosion.
4.  Stannis's response.  "Hundreds of men will die."  "Thousands."
5.  Tyrion's coolness under fire, as he successively plays each card in his hand.
6.  The fighting scenes.
7.  Cersei's dialouge with Sansa.
8.  Tyrion's speech to rally the soldiers, followed by "Oh.  Fuck.  Me."
9.  Cersei and Tommen is an incredible scene.  Cersei is on the verge of tears, as she prepares to kill Tommen and herself, and tries to keep his courage up.
10.  Old Dubrovnik.

341	RedChick	2013-04-25	10. This is still my number one episode by far.
342	King Kev.	2013-04-26	Quality television is what this episode was. It is probably the best Game Of Thrones episode ever, or at least right up there with Baelor. Not only was this some of the best this show has to offer, it was probably the best episode of TV from last year. Period.The special effects, the choreography, the acting, the EVERYTHING. The song at the end...This episode is majestic. 10/10.

375	Cressit	2012-05-27	Did Cersei wear a breastplate in the book? I can't remember.  She's amazing in this episode.  Almost making Shae interesting.
376	Balefont	2012-05-27	Holy shit, this episode is fucking awesome.
377	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	Effing EPIC!,,Lol, good place for a first post, welcome to Westerros sk888888!
378	Greywolf2375	2012-05-27	So THIS is why he has carried that two hander for two years.
379	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	Oh, nice look on Sandor's face when he saw the burning soldier!
380	Greywolf2375	2012-05-27	Did Cersei wear a breastplate in the book? I can't remember.  She's amazing in this episode.  Almost making Shae interesting.Not sure, but loving her "armor" - the wine and the gilded.
381	Triskan	2012-05-27	Holy shit.  The first time ever we've been shown and not told that Stannis is a good soldier.**Not knocking GRRM at all, just saying
382	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	Nasty scene with Sandor, Joffrey and Tyrion, more telling than in the book
383	sk888888	2012-05-27	Eat shit, dwarf...
384	Balefont	2012-05-27	Oh snap @ the Hound
385	Greywolf2375	2012-05-27	oh no he di'int.   For an action episode, the acting has been better than ever.
386	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	Ooooooh, Joffrey is craven. . . . .
387	Laohu	2012-05-27	Hmm... Stannis first to charge the beach and first to climb the ladders putting himself in harm's way. He is trying his hardest to be cannon fodder, is he not?
388	gougef	2012-05-27	F*CK THE KING!
389	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	I hear shouts, where's the king . . .  .and there's Pod!  Yeah!
390	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	Nice speech fromTyrion!
391	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	"Those are brave men knocking at our door . . . lets go kill them!"
392	Cressit	2012-05-27	Tyrion, the peoples' prince!
393	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	Oh brave Sansa!
394	sk888888	2012-05-27	Tyron is killing it tonite!
395	Greywolf2375	2012-05-27	THIS is how each episode should be written.   Changes, no changes...whatever.
396	Mya Stone	2012-05-27	What's this I feel? Do I actually LIKE Shae? 
It feels funny.
397	Mya Stone	2012-05-27	Will they kiss? Will they? Hmm?
398	Balefont	2012-05-27	Sing me a song, little bird.
399	Lady IronHeart	2012-05-27	These scenes with the Hound are AMAZING. FInally!!
400	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	Sandor - not so drunk as in the book,   Better speech, I think.  "You won't hurt me." 
Oh fuck.
No song.  No hope for an imagined kiss.  Oh fuck.  They fucked the scene.
401	sk888888	2012-05-27	Love the Hound and Sansa.  Just sayin.
402	Cressit	2012-05-27	Is that the doll Ned gave Sansa?
403	Greywolf2375	2012-05-27	Little girl holding a doll, young woman holding her to vow to the king...daughter remembering her family.  
NOT a SanSan person, but pretty much a perfect scene.
404	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	I thought, this scene with San San will be better than the book, but they dropped the ball.  Big time.
405	sk888888	2012-05-27	Tyrion the kneeslayer!
406	Laohu	2012-05-27	Heartbreaking scene for the Hound... acting and writing both are so good this episode!! Shit!
407	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	Yes, the doll scene was good, but they dropped the rest of the scene.  WTF.
408	Greywolf2375	2012-05-27	as good as the dialogue is, could "Oh fuck me!" be the best delivery?  /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
409	Mya Stone	2012-05-27	POD!!!!!!
410	Balefont	2012-05-27	Maybe George's point is that shipping San San is not truly part of the story.  < smirk >
411	The Other Knight	2012-05-27	I thought, this scene with San San will be better than the book, but they dropped the ball.  Big time.Don't you mean GRRM dropped the ball? He wrote it. /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
412	Greywolf2375	2012-05-27	and there is the scar
413	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	Again, what's with the sympathetic Cersei.  She was a friggin B***H in the book, not a sympathetic, fond mother.  That is big time disappointing.
414	Mya Stone	2012-05-27	Stannis seeing "Renly" is amazing. Goosebumps.
415	sbjackdaw	2012-05-27	GRRM is really bringing up the writing quality this episode. Take note, D&D! THIS is how it's done. /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
416	Balefont	2012-05-27	Loras!!!!
417	Cressit	2012-05-27	No Renly's ghost?  I couldn't really tell what Stannis saw when he screamed....

421	Balefont	2012-05-27	Rains of Castamere!
422	Mya Stone	2012-05-27	HOLY SHIT. 
Who's watching it again immediately?
423	Greywolf2375	2012-05-27	so apparently they also have the ability to make one hour turn into 20 minutes, because it can NOT have been 55+ min since this episode began.
424	Triskan	2012-05-27	And here is The National to take us home...
425	Laohu	2012-05-27	Anyone else digging this song during the end credits?
426	Greywolf2375	2012-05-27	No Renly's ghost?The armor was never brought up, so it wasn't as big a deal to have it pointed out.   Just the fact that reinforcements showed was enough
427	Triskan	2012-05-27	HOLY SHIT.Who's watching it again immediately?I watched it on not-HD on my main TV just now.  Now I'm going to HBO GO on my computer which gets much better resolution.
428	Mya Stone	2012-05-27	Rains of Castamere!I am gonna cry real tears the next time we hear that song.
429	Terilien	2012-05-27	I think Cersei in this scene makes a perfect transition for the more unhinged future cersei.
430	Laohu	2012-05-27	That hour flew by, WOW!
431	Mya Stone	2012-05-27	I took Stannis watching the person on the white horse as Renly's ghost. I may be wrong but he totally looked spooked by it.

433	Triskan	2012-05-27	For anyone who isn't already aware, there is a thread about the version of Rains of Castamere over in the entertainment forum where you may listen and bicker.  /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
434	Harrad	2012-05-27	Very nice sea of green fire. We don't need no stinkin chain.
435	MegasAV	2012-05-27	What idiotic battle commanders they made Stannis and Davos out to be, approaching a single unsurrounded vessel, which everyone had to consider to be somesort of trap given there were no Lannister  naval vessels in the bay.  I suppose the limitiations of budget but I would have much more enjoyed it, if at least there were a few Lannister ships attacking Stannis's fleet as which occured in the book.  Which made Tyrions strategy much more believable

I havent had this much of a Nerdgasm since Return of the King. That was probably the single best hour of TV programming ive ever watched,
437	Wilmot's K'Kompany	2012-05-27	Anyone else digging this song during the end credits?I am.  Fits nicely with "Oh Fuck Me."
438	Harrad	2012-05-27	I took Stannis watching the person on the white horse as Renly's ghost. I may be wrong but he totall looked spooked by it.Was there an antler crown. Without that how was anyone to know it was supposed to be Renley?
439	Cressit	2012-05-27	I watched it on not-HD on my main TV just now.  Now I'm going to HBO GO on my computer which gets much better resolution. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' /> Plus the interactive features

441	Istari	2012-05-27	That was fucking brilliant. It exceeded all my expectations
Although the scene between Sandor and Sansa wasn't what San/San fans had hoped, I think it was perfect given the context of the show
oh, fuck me
442	Howdyphillip	2012-05-27	I want to write a long and elegant post about how amazing this episode was, but I can't because I shit myself and I have to go clean up...
443	Cheese Pudding	2012-05-27	AMAZINGGreat episode. The Rains of Castamere /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' /> The RW is coming...I still prefer this version http://www.youtube.c...h?v=t0xu7P-zzsk but the series one was good too.
444	Triskan	2012-05-27	Stupid question of the day:
-In the books, does the Battle of the Blackwater happen at night?  I always pictured it being during the day.
445	Mark Antony	2012-05-27	Great Episode
wonder what's gonna happen with Stannis
446	Howdyphillip	2012-05-27	Triesk...

448	Ser Greguh	2012-05-27	Holy fuck.
They weren't kidding when they said they went all-out.
449	Horus Ex Machina	2012-05-27	Very nice.  I just love drunk Cersei.
450	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	Overall, awesome, but there are nitpicks.  Even If GRRM did write it.  I would think time constraints reduced the SanSan scene.  But so many SanSan scenes have been reduced that I wonder if he has had a change of heart over what he originally wrote.
451	Ser Joe of House Targaryen	2012-05-27	Just fucking brilliant. Loved every minute of it. The Hound/Bronn scene, Tyrion's speech to the men, Hound getting freaked out by the fire, Stannis leading, drunk Cersei, and then Pod to the rescue! YEAH! Oh and loved The Rains of Castamere, too!!
452	salt	2012-05-27	Stupid question of the day:-In the books, does the Battle of the Blackwater happen at night?  I always pictured it being during the day.Starts during the day, continues through night.
453	Mr. E	2012-05-27	Holy God I did not see the Reynes of Castamere coming in the credits!!!!!!!!!!!!!GEEKS OUT!!Stupid question of the day:-In the books, does the Battle of the Blackwater happen at night?  I always pictured it being during the day.I think it happens during the day, but the did it at night because it would be cheaper, and look more real. Win win
454	Cressit	2012-05-27	I took the look as "oh shit...back up"...but could be.Either way, Loras taking off the helm was pretty cool.I'm totally okay with it how it happened. just was going to kick myself if I blinked and missed a cool visual of Renly's standard emerging thru the mist of something like that.I wonder if the chain-obsessors are still going to be pissed after seeing that great hour of television?The hardcore San-San shippers will be bummed, too, I suspect.But honestly, how can anyone be disappointed after that?
455	summer_stark	2012-05-27	ok.  i loved that episode.  i'm not a big "battles" person -- but i loved that episode so much.  THANK YOU GRRM!  Cersei is a bitch, joffrey is almost sympathetic, the hound is scared, the troops scream halfman, the wildfire blows shit up.  tyrion is very obviously in charge of the wildfire strategy and getting taking out the guys ramming the gate.  pod saves tyrion -- who has the look on his face i imagined upon seeing ser mandon -- relief then bewilderment.  sansa comforting the ladies in maegor's holdfast.  wildfire blowin shit up.  loras standing in as renly's ghost and i was actually choked up when tywin came in. bronn and co singing rains of castamere, and then them talking about how it was the lannister song -- and then the national playing it at the end.  so friggin psyched right now.  too bad the season finale won't be 2 hrs.  i wish everyone else's storylines could have as much time to end with as KL's storyline.

459	mafalda	2012-05-27	My sister who doesn't read the books commented on what a nice song the Rains of Castamere was. If only she knew...
This episode was epic. Hands down best episode this season!
I do wish Sansa would have kissed the Hound or at least sang to him, but I'm just glad they put it in the scene anyway.
Was that the doll Ned gave her to cheer her up after Lady's death?
Am I starting to like Shae? When she showed Sansa that knife I was like Hell Yeah!
The wildfire... wow. Tyrion being badass as usual, Podrick And Bronn... I will continue to like Bronn until the end of the third season.
Drunk Cersei... can't wait to see the fourth season where she will be drunk in almost every episode. Speaking of, are there any rumors on how they will do the fourth season? I can't imagine too many people being content without Tyrion, Dany, and Jon.
Next week looks like a great finale too. 10 episodes just isn't enough though.
"Oh, fuck me."
460	ckal	2012-05-27	LORAS WAS 'RENLY'S GHOST.'
HE WAS WEARING THE ANTLER HELM AND RENLY'S ARMOR.

I love how they added Rains of Castamere twice! Beautiful at the end credits.

It only makes sense for Renly's lover to carry on his memory in battle, not some character we've never seen or heard of before (in the show). It gives more depth to Loras' character.
480	Lord Balbi	2012-05-27	Peter Dinklage deserves a honorary oscar for that. After all, it`s not tv...
481	Precursor	2012-05-27	Loved it.
482	Grail King	2012-05-27	Not a San San shipper, but I thought she should had at least cup his cheeks or just put a hand on his face, and Sansa with the doll was warming, remembering her dad and family.
And Sansa did well calming the ladies.
Looks like Shae may take the part of Dontos, next week showed LF delivering the lier lines that the hound was to say.
Cersei to fuzzy warm, but getting ready to kill Tommen was chilling.

486	Trebla	2012-05-27	Blown away by the epiosde. The green flame was outstanding. Action was superb.
- Loved the scene with Bronn and Sandor. It was like GRRM was teasing us after probably being asked a million times who would win in a fight.
-Lena Heady was again fantastic. I was iffy on her portrayal last season but I think she has grown into the role. Sophie Turner also has her time to shine.
- So Shae is from Lorath
- Tyrion was aged up, only four years younger than Jaime and Cersei. Or at least that how Cersei remembers it, being four when her mother died.
- I kept wondering if Tyrion would indeed get sliced because there was a lack on KG knights mention. But when Joff ordered Ser Boros and Ser Mandon to accompany him I knew he was doomed. Nice to see Pod get the save.
- I almost did a fan boy squee when the Hound told Joff to fuck off.
- And ending the episode with The Rains of Castamere might have been the best moment in the entire show. chills
487	Cheese Pudding	2012-05-27	I know but think of the context of the show. It only makes sense for Renly's lover to carry on his memory in battle, not some character we've never seen or heard of before (in the show).

488	legba11	2012-05-27	There is a small stag on the front of his helm, but that doesn't look like Renly's armor, I am looking at the image here and the shots of Renly.  It's hard to tell, but the gold peice below his neck doesn't look the same and the should guard looks plainer.
489	Ser Adam	2012-05-27	It's funny, just a few weeks ago I was thinking Jaqen and Shae have similar accents, but never even considered they may be from the same place(that is if he really is from Lorath like he claims).
490	hugh57	2012-05-27	- I almost did a fan boy squee when the Hound told Joff to fuck off.I think that was even better than Joffrey getting slapped. The look on Joff's face: priceless /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />
491	Planetary	2012-05-27	Purposefully filmed as a night battle. Benioff and Weiss said that was partly to stretch budget dollars, and partly because certain significant elements (the wildfire, the flaming arrows) look a lot more breathtaking at night. Good call IMO.
492	legba11	2012-05-27	I think that was even better than Joffrey getting slapped. The look on Joff's face: priceless /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />My non-book fiance, "That was as good as one slap, but not a triple slap"

494	JonHo	2012-05-27	Sansa and Cersei and Tyrion owned this episode. Wow.
495	Ciglon	2012-05-27	Rory McCann was excellent as the houn in this episode, absolutely can't wait to see more of him later on.
496	House Snow	2012-05-27	If this episode is any indication I cant wait for the fight on the wall.
497	Ghost714	2012-05-27	Best fucking episode ever on television!
A lot of changes, but most of them where awesome.
I loved how Bronn and Sandor had a bit off a stand off, and then there was that guy running towards the Hound on fire, and Bronn shot the guy, it was awesome. 
It's pretty out of character for Stannis to lead the charge all the way up to the battlements, but I am fine with it, because it made Stannis look so bad ass. 
Is it me, or does Sansa look taller and more beautiful in every episode? I really like her lines to Joffrey, when he made her kiss his sword, Sophie Turner delivered those lines perfectly. She really was a great Sansa in this episode, and this whole season for that matter.
How are they going to get Stannis out of there? He is still on the battlements when Tywin gets there?

499	Bastard of Boston	2012-05-27	Is it possible to articulate an orgasm? I'll try.What a thing of beauty. The show overcame its limitations beautifully, IMO...like an ugly dude with so much swagger, he's able to get the really hot chick. This episode was Tyrion. And, yes, he was awesome tonight...the best motivational speaker I've ever listened to. Give me someone to kill or something to blow up.Really loved the calm before the storm, and how the episode opened up with an extended period of silence...such a great way to lead into all the shit blowing up shit. And speaking of blowing up shit, the wildfire was beautful.So much of what characterizes the Battle of Blackwater is the private moments between characters -- not the battle itself. For me, I loved the chapters within Maegor's between Cersei and Sansa. It was probably my favorite part of the war. I thought the show adapted their interactions well. Seeing Sansa with the doll, a callback to Ned's gift in season 1, gave me goosebumps. This is why I can't hate Sansa. Her character arc is one of the most satisfying for me -- she has the longest road to travel...it has twists and really stupid turns, and has some really bitchy potholes, but it leads to the best places. You just gotta stop asking "Are we there yet," and enjoy the ride.Cersei/Lena was phenomenal. The quintessential proud, yet desperate, Lioness on the throne with her cub. Even loved the designer war-themed corset. Probably was necessary all those years she was married to Robert. I'm sure she appreciated the opportunity to wear it again.The Hound really felt like the Hound for the first time in awhile...yeah, because GRRM was writing him. All the characters are gonna feel like themselves. I always wonder if the non-readers get the Hound considering he hasn't done much up to this point.Pod also. Considering how vital he was to Blackwater, I wondered if him being a non-factor would hurt him. Now, I almost like the fact that he hasn't uttered a word until today. He's the sleeping giant. Do not fuck with Pod. Don't. You will get fucked up.Really liked the juxtaposition between punk ass Joffrey and hard ass Stannis. I thought the scenes of Joff pissing his pants, combined with the scenes of Stannis pissing on Lannister soldiers accomplished all they needed to.Such a great episode. I think the show needed this type of thing...just one episode focused on one location, allowing all the scenes room to breathe.
500	legba11	2012-05-27	The cleverly did not show you Davos or Tyrion in the previews...
501	Warden of the North121	2012-05-27	By the way everyone....finale looks to be great.I saw:Jaqen and AryaJon fighting the HalfhandDany in the House of the Undying=)Add your boy Jaime and Brienne to that list as well as Theon
502	Castel	2012-05-27	That last scene with Tywin and Loras bursting in and the Rains of Castamere cover basically justified this entire show.
503	StannisWins	2012-05-27	They did such a good job not releasing even one single pic of the green wildfire. Nice job by HBO on that front.
504	ViennaGirl	2012-05-27	Stannis climbing up the ladder first - OMG. And Rains of Castermere was like a love letter to book readers. And drunk Cersei! And SanSan, and I'm not at all a SanSan shipper... That was nerdtastic in every single way. I'm going to cry next week when the season is over...
505	rmholt	2012-05-27	QFT.Favorite part? Practically impossible to choose.Well...the big green explosion bc they got the color just right and I love fireworks.  By a millimicron.  I would have tossed the whole book over the side gladly if Sansa had gone with the Hound.
506	Manuela Freitas	2012-05-27	The last song in the soundtrack is Three Blasts. It's clear what the final climax will be.
507	ckal	2012-05-27	Add your boy Jaime and Brienne to that list as well as TheonAh yes! I was so overwhelmed tonight I completely forget half the preview.On top of Jaqen/Arya, HotU, Jon vs Halfhand, we will also get:The burning of Winterfell, and Jaime/Brienne fighting! I hope they don't cut off Jaime's hand this episode...but it would make for one hell of a finale.
508	Darth Pipes	2012-05-27	Great episode!  The best of the season and maybe the best of the series.
Great, great job, GRRM.  If GOT gets nominated for Best Writing, I hope it's this episode.  It showed the benefits of stationing the show in one area and focusing on a smaller group of characters.  Everyone gets a chance to shine, from Lena Headley (who was the standout) to Eugene Simon as Lancel and even the guy playing Pod.  Varys scene was terrific too and I can't believe I'm saying this but I absolutely loved Shae in this episode. 
The battle itself was amazing.  No chain but blowing up the Blackwater more than made up for it.  The fighting itself was intesne and bloody and they wisely moved Stannis to the battlefield in this one.  I liked how he was incapable of giving a great speech, just "Come with me and take this city!"
509	Ghost714	2012-05-27	Yes having the Rains of Castamore playing at the end was amazing, I have never had a bigger case of goosebumps in my life. That was truly the best ending ever.
510	rmholt	2012-05-27	Holy God I did not see the Reynes of Castamere coming in the credits!!!!!!!!!!!!!GEEKS OUT!!I think it happens during the day, but the did it at night because it would be cheaper, and look more real. Win winWerent they singing the Rains of Castamere as a drinking song at the beginning?Marie
511	Darth Pipes	2012-05-27	I forgot to add this but GREAT touch by GRRM having Sansa pick up the doll Ned gave her last season.
Another bit from next episode...Tywin Lannister riding into the throne room on his horse.  Though I suspect we won't see it take a shit. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />

512	Big Noyd	2012-05-27	Just as many of us suspected, Loras played the part of Renly's ghost and Tyrion got a slice across the face instead of his nose getting lopped off. Glad they kept variations on both. Very well done. 
Nice shot, Pod.
513	rmholt	2012-05-27	LORAS WAS 'RENLY'S GHOST.'HE WAS WEARING THE ANTLER HELM AND RENLY'S ARMOR.=)LORAS WAS 'RENLY'S GHOST.'HE WAS WEARING THE ANTLER HELM AND RENLY'S ARMOR.=)Darn now I have to watch it again
514	ckal	2012-05-27	Well...the big green explosion bc they got the color just right and I love fireworks.  By a millimicron.  I would have tossed the whole book over the side gladly if Sansa had gone with the Hound.That better and more brutal than I anticipated. Looked wonderful! I was hoping The Hound would demand Sansa to sing him a song and that he would be really drunk and give her his cloak, but that's minor. We got the point he has a thing for her....or is he just a nice guy.....? HahaThe last song in the soundtrack is Three Blasts. It's clear what the final climax will be.Whoa. Didn't know that. You think they are going to end the season on the attack on the Fist of the First Men? That would be ridiculously amazing. The Others take them....
515	Big Noyd	2012-05-27	Btw, that wildfire explosion was one of the most badass things ever put on TV. Made the absence of the chain acceptable.
516	ckal	2012-05-27	Darn now I have to watch it againYou say that like it's a bad thing =P
517	StannisWins	2012-05-27	God I'm already annoyed at how little credit Tyrion is going to get.
518	Triskan	2012-05-27	They did such a good job not releasing even one single pic of the green wildfire. Nice job by HBO on that front.Totally agreed.Now please let it be that they've kept The Bastard under pocket for the finale.....please.
519	rmholt	2012-05-27	Again, what's with the sympathetic Cersei.  She was a friggin B***H in the book, not a sympathetic, fond mother.  That is big time disappointing.Tell that to Lancel who got punched in his arrow.
520	Baitac	2012-05-27	I think Lena just won herself an Emmy.
521	Ghost714	2012-05-27	I loved Shae and Sansa together in this episode. 
To me, there was so many people tied for best performance of the episode. Sophie Turner was amazing, as was the guys playing Bronn and Sandor, and Stephen Dillane was such a bad ass, what a cool different version of Stannis.
522	JonHo	2012-05-27	I think Lena just won herself an Emmy.She definitely deserves one, holy shit.
523	Horus Ex Machina	2012-05-27	The cleverly did not show you Davos or Tyrion in the previews...The cleverly did not show you Davos or Tyrion in the previews...The cleverly did not show you Davos or Tyrion in the previews...He he he,... *rubs hands together whilst grinning maniacally* ...I'm going to enjoy listening to the newbies speculate all week!

525	nara	2012-05-27	What an amazing episode!!! Literally cheered and clapped my hands on several occasions.  I made the mistake of trying to eat dinner while watching and stopped with the fork halfway to my mouth several times because I was so caught up in it!
Loved everyone!  Happy to see Podrick!!!!
Loved the Cersei/Tommen scene addition.  If I didn't know their future, I would have really been scared for them.
I do wish they'd changed it a little so that Joffrey did something useful.  Since they aged him up, it was a little strange that he meekly obeyed his mommy and left the battle.
526	Grey Robb	2012-05-27	DAMN the "Rains of Castamere"!!! /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' /> /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' /> /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />
Best Episode ... EVER!
527	Triskan	2012-05-27	One can go on and on and on about the brilliant casting choices, but Charles Dance as Tywin is so fucking spot-on...
528	rmholt	2012-05-27	THE TURTLE and its destruction rocked a bit
529	ckal	2012-05-27	Here's the song guys!http://www.youtube.c...h?v=kOfTvtWYBek
530	Baitac	2012-05-27	One can go on and on and on about the brilliant casting choices, but Charles Dance as Tywin is so fucking spot-on...He truly scares me through the t.v.!
531	Triskan	2012-05-27	He truly scares me through the t.v.!Good!The Lion does not concern himself with the sheep...or something like that /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
532	Triskan	2012-05-27	So I suspect that the end of this episode will be a bit tough to follow for the non-book readers, won't it?
I mean, we did get LF talking to Ser Loras and Margery after Renly's death, and we also got LF talking to Tywin at Harrenhal, but will people follow from the brief glimpses of Loras plus Tywin walking in at the end what has really transpired?
Also, will we get anyone from Stannis' side in the final episode, or will the non-book fans be left to wonder if Davos is dead, and Stannis is ruined?
533	WillWork4NinjaPowers	2012-05-27	I didn't read through all of the comments, but I don't get the "No Renley's ghost" stuff....Loras was wearing Renley's shizz, wasn't he?  That is why Stannis was yelling "I killed you!!!" 
Oh man.  I was choking up for Tommen.  When Loras opened the door I was like "Thank God!"  Gah!  I know he isn't dead yet in the books, but I'm holding out that Maggy was wrong about him.  That was well written and scared me.
534	Mya Stone	2012-05-27	Oh, George, you cheeky bastard. 
Cersei to Shae: (paraphrased) That must be one heck of story, Tell me about your MYSTERIOUS HISTORY, Shae. 
Shae: When I was 13...(LANCEL COMES RUNNING IN KNOCKING EVERYTHING OVER) 
Me: Giggling. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />
535	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	Who did Sandor walk in with in the scene with Bronn?  Is that someone we should know?
536	LordBloodraven	2012-05-27	Magnificent episode, Wildfire, Rains, Blackwater= Winning. I didn't see the minutes flying. Shout out to Stan, Tyrion, Cersei, Sansa and the Hound for the acting.
Nice tidbit. C: Jaime was the heir and I was to be sold like a horse to a stranger, to be ridden whenever it pleased him
S: You were Robert's Queen!!!
C: You will be Joffrey's. Enjoy it. /rolleyes.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':rolleyes:' />
537	Triskan	2012-05-27	Tell that to Lancel who got punched in his arrow.Minor nitpick.It was pretty clear that he got shot in his right shoulder (or just below it), and Cercei punched him in the same spot on his left side. Clearly this is the fault of GRRM's lazy writing!
538	Ser Joe of House Targaryen	2012-05-27	Oh and Varys giving Tyrion a map of the tunnels under the city.....foreshadowing??? /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />

Darn now I have to watch it AGAIN
540	Brynden Bloodraven	2012-05-27	Just finished my second viewing. I still can't gather my thoughts and form a coherent post. The battle scenes were fantastic... the hound cutting a man in half... Stannis taking off the top of a Gold Cloak's skull... Tyrion taking off a leg at the knee, oh my! "If any of you comes back without blood on your sword, I'll rape your corpse!"
541	rmholt	2012-05-27	Who did Sandor walk in with in the scene with Bronn?  Is that someone we should know?Yeah, huh?
542	legba11	2012-05-27	I think Stannis was yelling "Stand and Fight" to his retreating men in that last scene.
543	championj	2012-05-27	What an amazing episode. GRRM did such a fantastic job translating what he wrote in the novels into just an hour of television gold. I love how many lines from the book made it into the show. The one thing I was expecting that wasn't in the episode was the giant chain Tyrion was working on. It would have just amped up the action even more. Nonetheless it was such a fantastic episode.
544	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	What I really liked about the episode was how smart Tyrion ends up being - the right gate, the right plan, the wildfire, the right attitude.  For those who have not read the books, the message is delivered very clearly.

546	legba11	2012-05-27	I wonder if Dinklage is going to have to wear a prosthetic for the rest of the series.  That was a pretty serious shot to the face.
547	redditdedditrevolver	2012-05-27	Just watched Davos' boat exploding again - awesomeness.
548	timstanton	2012-05-27	Anyone know if ser barriston is gonna make another appearance this season? Doesn't look like they have room. Hopefully that is where dany starts off in season 3.
549	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	I wonder if Dinklage is going to have to wear a prosthetic for the rest of the series.  That was a pretty serious shot to the face.Looks like just a scar, though, no nose removed.Nice shot of the aftermath of the explosion of the wildfire, the look of horror on everyone's face, Bronn, Tyrion and Sandor, while Joffrey is grinning and the pyromancer is smug.Another strange fact change - Cersei says her mother died when  she was 4?  Did I misunderstand?  Are they changing Tyrion's age?  There should be a 9 year difference.
550	legba11	2012-05-27	I don't remember that number from the books, where did they say it? (Not denying it, curious)

I would have preferred for him to walk in alone. He's a man without friends. I loved the Bronn save. Those two are a great duo. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

556	Soiled Septa	2012-05-27	Cersei was given great material and rose to occasion. The final scene with her and Tommen in the Throne Room was phenomenal.
557	True Northerner	2012-05-27	I don't watch award shows, but can individual episodes win anything? If so, that episode needs to win the "best fucking hour of televion in the history of ever" award.

559	timstanton	2012-05-27	@creepy crawl
That's one of the things I love about the books. Since its written in the POV format. GRRM is really good at cliffhangers and making you believe people have died etc. it's a lot more difficult to pull that kind of thing off in the show. For example, there is maybe 2-300 pages between when the fake bran and rickon are burned to when we find out they are alive.
560	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	I don't remember that number from the books, where did they say it? (Not denying it, curious)It's referred to in various places, but mainly, I think, in AFFC and ADWD.  Check the Wiki, it will quote the chapters.
561	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	I may have just missed it, but did Davos, and his son die?Wow, yet another first poster!  Welcome to Westeros, and my God, read the books.  The HBO series leaves out way, way to much, Creepy Crawl, the books are amazing.
562	Craven Mummer	2012-05-27	There may have been that many pages in between, but when they "died" I flipped thru the chapters til I saw Bran had another chapter.A®ÂÂ<U+0095>

Crickets... Anyone? Strong belwas...and a certain eunuch with a staff? Hope he doesn't get cut. They also better include the brotherhood without banners since they have alluded to them do many times

565	House Snow	2012-05-27	LOL imagine how the non-readers feel.  Love how the ending leaves you with a WTF happened feel, whose dead, alive, captured, etc.
566	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	Watching the second time around, of course, Tommen is there.  They didn't send him to safety!

Did I misunderstand?  Are they changing Tyrion's age?  There should be a 9 year difference.I wasn't sure if she said "I was four" or "I was a fool", but assuming the former, I think it's because Tyrion does not look 8 year younger than Cersei and Jaime...

Didn't want to admit it but I did the exact same thing, was happy that SoS was just numbered chapters because I have no self control
569	Carter209	2012-05-27	When the Hound came back from the battle, all I wanted was a "F*ck the King" line, but damn he did better than I expected. The Hound may yet be seen properly in the show.
For book readers: Anyone else think Martin's dropping hints for future books? I thought the Cersei-Sansa exchange where Cersei was talking about Sansa being a "younger, beautiful" queen(that's what I took it as anyway), seemed like a hint on that prophecys front? Not to mention the fact that SanSan was pretty well shot down here, at least in a romantic way.
Other than that, 12/10. The wildfyre alone got a 10/10.
570	Rockroi	2012-05-27	Letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just shoot the arrow, light the fleet on fire, storm the castle and just get right to it.  This was the most intense episode of the series and â<U+0080>¦ and we all knew how it was going to endâ<U+0080>¦ BEAT THAT!What I liked:Watching some good friends   â<U+0080>¦. Screaming 'Let me out':  The building, growing sense of doom; the painful way the men in Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> ships were terrorized; the way Tyrion worried endlessly; the way the women stayed in that room; the way the bells tolled and the drumsâ<U+0080>¦ the drumsâ<U+0080>¦ the drums..  The pressure and anticipation of this monumental battle as it crushed down on all these people was immeasurable.  The show captured- maybe for the first time â<U+0080><U+0093>the horrible inflexibility of being trapped.  Trapped on those ships, trapped on those walls, trapped in that armor, in that room, on that Throne.  I thought Martin did as good of a job as ever in bringing the pressure of the battle up to everyone.  It was horrible, complete, total.  Unbearable.The Reins of Castermere: I just thought it was the perfect touch.  From start to finish.The Fall of the King: We donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t say it enough on these boards but Joff was great this episode.  Stammering, scared, overwhelmed and a little bitch the whole time.  Give that actor a fucking award. I have never believed a King more capable of pissing his pants at the same time he shat himself than that scene.  The Regent and the Dove:   In the books, I thought that the Cersei-Sansa scenes during Blackwater were as good as anything in that book (my favorite, I may add).  And the show did not disappoint.  Cersei determined to spread her anguish and toxicity to Sansa; Sansa playing her part to the letter.   I felt that helplessness and the desire to kill and hurt the things closest to you EVEN WHEN you are dying yourself.  Cersei is that bitterness that we all know but rarely admit - that when we are in trouble, we are capable of scalding those closest to us.  Cersei is the person that chops off her nose to spite her face.And then with Tommen.  And I knew she wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t do it, but I still thought there was a chance that â<U+0080>¦ that she would end up the way Aerys did â<U+0080>¦ .Sansa, meanwhile was as incredible as always.  Sansa knows what is expected of her; she does what will keep her alive and makes sure she plays the part, hits the notes, makes her marks and survives.The Hound: I thought they captured the Houndâ<U+0080><U+0099>s rise and fall as well as anything.  His brutality, his killer instinct and then his collapse.  The fear, the fire, the anguish.  And the knowledge that once down you cannot just get back up again.The Quarterman: Another episode; another masterpiece by Dinklidge.   This time it was capturing both fear and desperation.  The whole time we knew Tyrion gets to live, but it was how he carried himself here that we knew would be the centerpiece of this story.  No more stupid slap-stick with him missing the battle; no cut aways.  No.  Tyrion had to be knee-deep in this shit hole.  And we got that in spades.  Glad Pod was there again, though.WHY SO SERIOUS????!!!!  Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll end this where I always knew I would- by talking about the serious man.Look, when I saw Stannis watch his fleet burning his reaction was ...  Stannis.  Fleet on fire?  Then Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll lead the boats myself.Wildfire?  The Imp played his best card too soon.Hundreds dead?  No, thousands.Get to the beach?  Fuck off- Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>M GETTING INTO MY THRONE ROOM!!!The sword, the face, the eyes, the voice, the fury, the fury, THE FURY!!!  Stannis owned.  Absolutely from start to â<U+0080><U+009C>Voltron-combination-to-defeat-himâ<U+0080><U+009D> ending, Stannis was what made this work.  Those people inside that city have to be afraid... but of what?  Something?  No... someone... If Stannis was a tool of Mal; if Stannis was weak, or unsure, or vacillating, or a delegator or if he were anything but that fucking rage-machine that climbedâ<U+0080>¦ the ladder â<U+0080>¦ first â<U+0080>¦ that whole scene is just a bunch of idiots trying to look like their fighting on a beach at night.  In order for us to feel that the city was REALLY in dangerâ<U+0080>¦ the Danger has to land on the beachâ<U+0080>¦.â<U+0080>¦ the Danger has to scream for his laddersâ<U+0080>¦.... the Danger has to climb that wal...â<U+0080>¦ the Danger has to kill Lannistersâ<U+0080>¦.â<U+0080>¦.the Danger has to command his forces while screaming to take his city backâ<U+0080>¦And he worked.  We bought it the whole way.  Stannis was what we thought he was: the fury; the enemy; the fear; the danger.  The Other.And he lost.  He lost in the only way he could have lost- Tyrion+Tywin+Highgarden+Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing+Aerys Targaryenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s fucking wildfire.  Seriously- Sun Tzu probably has a chapter for Stannis entitled, â<U+0080><U+009C>And sometimes everyone in the world really is out to get you.â<U+0080><U+009D>Butâ<U+0080>¦ but this one last parting messageâ<U+0080>¦ That was Book 2.  In Book 5 (and the sample chapter we have out there in the future) Tywin- dead; Tyrion- dispossessed; Robb- dead; Balon-dead; Renly- still dead; Joff- dead; Cersei- meaningless; Hound- out of commission.But out there in the snow, with his flock of captured Karstarks, and his army of half-crazed Northerrers and Southerners ...just like on the water beforeâ<U+0080>¦â<U+0080>¦the Danger â<U+0080>¦ is still comingâ<U+0080>¦.What I did not Like:Nothing .  Okay, I wretched when Shae was on the screen.  But really, this was what the Balckwater needed to be: 55 minutes of tension, build-up, climax.  The Blackwater worked in the show for the exact same reasons the Blackwater worked in the books: because everything that happened we believed.Maybe not the best episode; maybe not the tightest episode.  But definitely the most gripping episode.

571	UnknownSoldier	2012-05-27	Was a great episode. Like I said in the nitpicking thread, the only thing I can nitpick about the episode is the way they did the scene on the Blackwater. The way it played out with the literal creeping doom as the wildfyre spread to the ships and then as everything got crushed up against the chain was one of my favorite scenes in the series. While the explosion was cool, it just didn't do the scene justice.
572	redditdedditrevolver	2012-05-27	I just love that everyone got some in this episode - Tyrion, Pod,Bronn Stannis...
Even Lancel, who's been emasculated all through this season, came off more badass then expected, taking an arrow and wanting to get back in...
and the rains of castemere at the end..I usually skip over the songs in the books because i can't make up the tunes in my head.. just brought it hauntingly to life
573	Triskan	2012-05-27	Thanks. I have never read any of the books, but plan on doing so soon.You may or may not be aware, but in this very forum there's another thread for those that have not read the books.  Noting wrong with being in this thread if you don't mind the spoilers, but you might prefer the "no spoilers" thread to this one.
574	MyGiantofLannister	2012-05-27	Holy monkeygates, what an amazing episode.
575	Creepy Crawl	2012-05-27	You may or may not be aware, but in this very forum there's another thread for those that have not read the books.  Noting wrong with being in this thread if you don't mind the spoilers, but you might prefer the "no spoilers" thread to this one.Yeah, I know. It's really no big deal. I like to hear what you guys have to say.
576	Harrad	2012-05-27	Maybe not the best episode; maybe not the tightest episode.  But definitely the most gripping episode.Maybe the fact that the episode stayed exclusively at KL has something to do with?
577	Maester Hodor	2012-05-27	That episode was fucking amazing!
Rains of Castamere at the end was brilliant. Best episode ever!
578	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-27	Great Episode! It just flew by. Surprised to see Joff bust out the Valaryian sword. Surprised Lightbringer looked so ordinary except it just took off half that guys head. How can Stannis escape this? Can't wait to find out.
579	MyGiantofLannister	2012-05-27	I was wondering how they were going to do the Tryion nose scene, they did it just fine. Now we hope to see how it looks like next episode.
But yes, thank the gods this episode lived up to the hype and more. Deserves more than a 10 out of 10, or a 5 out of 5. Holy fuck, Tywin coming in the last minute, that was more badass then anything I saw in the last few years.
580	Triskan	2012-05-27	Yeah, I know. It's really no big deal. I like to hear what you guys have to say.OK, cool.  Just wanted to make sure you knew what was up. Does anyone else feel like the actor playing Loras evolved dramatically from S1 to S2?  It's almost like it's a different person (and i'll be really embarrassed if someone comes in right now with "duh, you fucking idiot.  they recast him.").He seemed like such an androgen in S1 and not nearly as much here (not just tonight's episode, but the middle episodes too).
581	ChrisWarg	2012-05-27	What Stannis did not use a helmet??
582	axels15	2012-05-27	I loved the episode, but I'm going to focus on one thing.
I don't trust Varys. Not at all. That early scene with him and Tyrion, the way he spoke about dark magics... I know his whole story, and why he would be bothered by magic, but I don't trust him.
Anyway, loved the episode, imo, best of the series. Carry on
583	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	Letâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just shoot the arrow, light the fleet on fire, storm the castle and just get right to it.  This was the most intense episode of the series and â<U+0080>¦ and we all knew how it was going to endâ<U+0080>¦ BEAT THAT!<snip>Maybe not the best episode; maybe not the tightest episode.  But definitely the most gripping episode.I've been trying to tell you, Rockroi, how much I've enjoyed your summaries, but Error 500 and 503 keep wiping me out, lol!  Another excellent summary!
584	Darth Pipes	2012-05-27	I wasn't sure if she said "I was four" or "I was a fool", but assuming the former, I think it's because Tyrion does not look 8 year younger than Cersei and Jaime...It sounded like she said four too. I liked the bit about Tywin believing in the Gods but not trusting them.
585	Harrad	2012-05-27	Error 500 and 503 keep wiping me out, lol!  Another excellent summary!Site must be overloaded..got a bunch of those my own self.
586	WillWork4NinjaPowers	2012-05-27	She said she was 4 when her Mom died.  I thought she was 7.
587	Darth Pipes	2012-05-27	Oh, George, you cheeky bastard.Cersei to Shae: (paraphrased) That must be one heck of story, Tell me about your MYSTERIOUS HISTORY, Shae.Shae: When I was 13...(LANCEL COMES RUNNING IN KNOCKING EVERYTHING OVER)Me: Giggling. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />That was a funny scene.I expected Shae to say "This one time, Your Grace, at band camp..."
588	ckal	2012-05-27	"There may have been that many pages in between, but when they "died" I flipped thru the chapters til I saw Bran had another chapter.A®Ââ<U+0080>c(null) "Didn't want to admit it but I did the exact same thing, was happy that SoS was just numbered chapters because I have no self controlI did the same thing. I flipped ahead and saw another Bran chapter.But which book did you read? Your ASOS book had numbered chapters instead of names? What?
589	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	She said she was 4 when her Mom died.  I thought she was 7.She definitely said 4.  In the books she and Jaime are 9 years older, so Tyrion has been aged up, which seems like more rehab is going to be done to Cersei's character.  The Red Viper tells Tyrion about how Cersei twisted baby Tyrion's penis:  certainly a 4 year old won't be doing that.  I hope. /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' />
590	Lord Godric	2012-05-27	Speaking of Shae is she really a "Lorath commoner"?  I always got the impression her family may have been of noble blood.  Hence her not wanting to talk about her parents and not knowing how to serve someone else.
591	ckal	2012-05-27	OK, cool.  Just wanted to make sure you knew what was up.Does anyone else feel like the actor playing Loras evolved dramatically from S1 to S2?  It's almost like it's a different person (and i'll be really embarrassed if someone comes in right now with "duh, you fucking idiot.  they recast him.").He seemed like such an androgen in S1 and not nearly as much here (not just tonight's episode, but the middle episodes too).He is the same actor. But I agree he has undergone a drastic, and much improved change I am thankful for. He looked so pathetic in S1, but S2 he is actually....manly. Must be the change in attitude.
592	Triskan	2012-05-27	Speaking of the Red Viper....will we get that character near the end of S3 or the beginning of S4?
593	Warden of the North121	2012-05-27	Am I the only one who likes the little bit that Shae and "Jaquen" are the two German actors on this show and both are from Lorath? Very clever imo.
594	Triskan	2012-05-27	He is the same actor. But I agree he has undergone a drastic, and much improved change I am thankful for. He looked so pathetic in S1, but S2 he is actually....manly. Must be the change in attitude.That's what I thought.And there's nothing wrong with him being an Androgen or anything, but he was pretty unconvincing as a guy who could unseat The Mountain, tricks and all, in the first season.  This season I believed it.
595	ckal	2012-05-27	Sounded like Cersei definitely said "fool" to me.....not "four."
'Fool' would make sense as well, since that would tie her comments together from beginning to end. At the start she called Sansa a fool for believing the gods were merciful, and Cersei went through that whole story to explain that she was once like Sansa, a fool, and thought that praying could bring her mother back. Plus, GRRM wrote this episode guys, this is definitely something he would do. That's you know...good writing.
Cersei definitly said 'fool' not 'four.'
=)
596	J_Crews	2012-05-27	Awesome post snipped, not by choice, but, rather for brevity.I think Rockroi is my new hero!
597	olennaredyne	2012-05-27	Sorry, but can someone please explain the "chain" sequence that was left out? I've all the books (I swear) but I read the battle of the blackwater somewhat hastily, anxious to see what would happen, and don't recall exactly what a chain had to do with the battle. A literal metal chain? A chain of ships? What was it?
598	ckal	2012-05-27	Speaking of the Red Viper....will we get that character near the end of S3 or the beginning of S4?Probably S3 as IIRC, Oberyn showed up in ASOS towards the middle of the book.That's what I thought.And there's nothing wrong with him being an Androgen or anything, but he was pretty unconvincing as a guy who could unseat The Mountain, tricks and all, in the first season.  This season I believed it.Yes, I agree. In the book he is still described on several occasions as 'slender as a reed' but he should still have some sort of manly or musculature stature. Slender doesn't mean no muscle. The other problem was he was described many times as one of the most beautiful men in Westeros. Obviously that's a tall order for any male actor, but maybe it was his hair in S1, maybe he looked too boyish, maybe something else, but he looks more handsome/like a man in S2, this coming from a straight guy.
599	ckal	2012-05-27	Sorry, but can someone please explain the "chain" sequence that was left out? I've all the books (I swear) but I read the battle of the blackwater somewhat hastily, anxious to see what would happen, and don't recall exactly what a chain had to do with the battle. A literal metal chain? A chain of ships? What was it?Earlier in the book Tyrion ordered all the blacksmiths in King's Landing to stop making armor/weapons (orders from Cersei) and start making big links for a chain. It was a mystery until the battle, where we found out that after all of Stannis' fleet (save Sallador Sahn) entered the Blackwater River, Bronn and others raised a chain across the mouth of the river behind them, so no ships could escape. It turned into a literal flaming trap.
600	Caro99	2012-05-27	This was just such an epic brilliant episode which surpassed my expectations!! Cheers hbo you did a beautiful job!!! And george of course wrote pure gold! The actors delivered as we all knew they would and it was just beyond greatnes x) loved cersei drunk with sansa and tommen and lancel. Loved tyrion and sandor/bronn and sansa/joff's sword, stannis, davos everyone was brilliant. Even shae and pod! But as a devoted lover of san/san I was amazed by rory's work tonight and of sophie's. Every scene they were in was fantastoc! The hound even told joff what he deserbed and got away with it! Yes!! And now about the san/san moment: sandor's face as he wants to make sansa see that men are bad was just like the sandor in the books in that scene on the rooftop before the battle. And sansa's face as she asks him if he won't harm her was making me cry (if she had just cupped his cheek then I would forgive a little the lack of song and white cloak abscence) but I liked how they put the doll ned gave her in the scene for 2 reasons. Ned wanted to marry sansa to someone who was brave and gentle and strong and sandor is all those things.. And also cause so far ned was I guess to sansa the main guy in her heart or something, and she had felt safe with her dad, but to see her sort of leaving the doll behind to follow sandor just hints at my hopefuly heart that this scenario will repeat itself in later books were alayne stone or sansa as a queen in the north sort of thing does not know who to trust only to have sandor coming back and her recalling he will never hurt her <3 I have to watch it again and write this from somewhere that's not my phone though
601	Lord Godric	2012-05-27	Do we know if "The Rains of Castamere" will be on the soundtrack?  I was so surprised to hear them sing it.  It was great.
602	Tsavong Lah	2012-05-28	Sorry, but can someone please explain the "chain" sequence that was left out? I've all the books (I swear) but I read the battle of the blackwater somewhat hastily, anxious to see what would happen, and don't recall exactly what a chain had to do with the battle. A literal metal chain? A chain of ships? What was it?Tyrion had commissioned all the blacksmiths in KL to forge great chain links. He then hid the chain beneath the mouth of the Blackwater, with two large towers on either side. Once most of Stannis ships were past the chain, it was raised to keep them from escaping into the bay when the wildfire was let loose. In the books it wasn't a ship loaded with wildfire, the royal fleet was still there and fighting (to lure Stannis' fleet in), and then pots of wildfire were thrown from the battlements. The chain was instrumental in keeping any ships (but a few) from escapingEDIT: Ckal beat me to it.

603	SerJerTheUnchaste	2012-05-28	Best episode of the season (and I doubt the next will top it since we are going back to Qarth...and I doubt they will nail the HoU correctly.) I figured the chain was being cast aside for a large wildfire explosion but I thought they'd use it to just trap the ships...not cause destruction that massive....amazing!
I do wish they had given Pod at least 1 or 2 scenes throughout the season to add a little something more to his saving of Tyrion. Ser Dontos also probably wasn't even noticed by the majority of non-book readers since he has never reappeared since the 1st episode. Finally, if they had just put a little more effort into showing Renly in some really unique armor earlier in the season then the arrival of the "ghost" would have held some weight. As it was, my father looked at me and said, "who is this now?" Even after they showed Loras and Tywin he had no idea Loras was wearing Renly's armor.
604	SerJerTheUnchaste	2012-05-28	Oh and where the hell is Sallador Sahn? Why establish him as a character being recruited for attacking King's Landing and then not even have him there?
605	sh_wulff	2012-05-28	Do we know if "The Rains of Castamere" will be on the soundtrack?  I was so surprised to hear them sing it.  It was great.yes it is
606	Frumpus	2012-05-28	I loved every second of this episode. You could really tell GRRM wrote it, not just from the awesome dialogue and scenes, but also the little things, like all of the characters brought back that probably would have been cut by other writers (we saw both Mandon and Boros, although it looks like they used a Stannis soldier instead of Mandon to cut Tyrion down, unless I'm mistaken). I also liked the use of lots of unnamed characters playing roles. Who was that head archer? Or the guy who accompanied Sandor in the beginning? They probably have names or match with minor characters in George's mind, it's a pity we'll never know who they really were.
Awesome episode all around.
607	Kevin79	2012-05-28	Oh and where the hell is Sallador Sahn? Why establish him as a character being recruited for attacking King's Landing and then not even have him there?I was thinking the same thing. My guess is that they introduced him to find Davos on the Blackwater and then take him back to Dragonstone.This will probably happen next week.

Tyrion first had that sigh of relief that he was there, then got a curious look on his face, then wham. Down.
609	Morrigan	2012-05-28	Fantastic episode. Someone give an Emmy to Lena Heady, she stole the episode and was 100% Cersei. Sophie Turner was also wonderful. They're really coming into their roles, it's so nice to see.I wish the previous episodes had shown Ser Dontos and his note to Sansa to explain why she wouldn't go with the Hound. Of course, she just might not want to go with the Hound because he's a drunken brute... /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' /> but still, I'm annoyed at the lack of Ser Dontos this season, though that's not really a problem with this episode. Speaking of which, was that him juggling?? At first I thought "hey, it's Moonboy" but someone on WiC said it was Ser Dontos. He flashed by so quickly I didn't even recognize him. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />It's funny, just a few weeks ago I was thinking Jaqen and Shae have similar accents, but never even considered they may be from the same place(that is if he really is from Lorath like he claims).Hah, well come to think of it, both actors are German... /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />Great Episode! It just flew by. Surprised to see Joff bust out the Valaryian sword. Surprised Lightbringer looked so ordinary except it just took off half that guys head. How can Stannis escape this? Can't wait to find out.Nitpick: Hearteater isn't a Valyrian sword, it's just a normal sword. Widow's Wail is the Valyrian sword he gets as a wedding gift from Tywin (who melted down Ice /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' /> to make it and Oathkeeper).

613	erolyn	2012-05-28	Such a good episode. I was nervous the whole way through, even knowing everything that was going to happen.
Awesome things:
Cersei. Being a psychopath. So good.
Davos as battle commander - and his last yell back to Matthos.
All the shots of the wildfire, and ships burning. Even better than I'd pictured them in my head.
Everything with Bronn. Especially the brothel scene between him and the Hound. I'd watch a whole episode of Bronn and the Hound.
Everything with Tyrion. Just...Tyrion.
Sansa was really well fleshed out in this episode, and true to her character evolution in the books.
The one thing I missed was Sandor's "A hound will die for you, but never lie to you" line. I know he says it much earlier in the book, but when he didn't a few episodes ago I'd hoped they'd include it here. Not a SanSan fan, just love that line. Oh well.
614	AquariumDrinker	2012-05-28	That better and more brutal than I anticipated. Looked wonderful! I was hoping The Hound would demand Sansa to sing him a song and that he would be really drunk and give her his cloak, but that's minor. We got the point he has a thing for her....or is he just a nice guy.....? HahaHe gave her his cloak earlier in the season and he hasn't worn it since that I have noticed.
615	ckal	2012-05-28	It was Ser MandonYes, I was just responding to the user who said they didn't think it was the Kingsguard.That was my first thought but then i rewatched that scene and the fellow looked like he was wearing armor completely different from a kingsguard's. But I could be wrong.I figured they would have changed it because it would be confusing to non-book watchers, since there was no build up to a possible betrayal.Hmm well I would have to say it was definitely the Kingsguard, and namingly Ser Mandon. Ser Mandon's name was used several times in the episode and it was him and Ser Boros that Joffrey sent out with Tyrion.Well to be honest, we didn't expect this at all in the book either. It took us completely by surprise. We don't really understand until we read some Tyrion POV's in ASOS thathe thinks it was Cersei who had Ser Mandon try to kill him.
616	Sir Cadogan	2012-05-28	Oh and where the hell is Sallador Sahn? Why establish him as a character being recruited for attacking King's Landing and then not even have him there?To save our favorite onion.
617	ckal	2012-05-28	He gave her his cloak earlier in the season and he hasn't worn it since that I have noticed.Yeah after that scene I figured it wouldn't happen, but I was wondering if he would have gotten his cloak back before this episode. I guess it wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to give it to her twice...
618	jlk7e	2012-05-28	It's funny, just a few weeks ago I was thinking Jaqen and Shae have similar accents, but never even considered they may be from the same place(that is if he really is from Lorath like he claims).I think that place is "Germany."
619	Onions4all	2012-05-28	Uh-Maze-Ing
They seriously must have allocated their entire budget to film that episode. Given the way they've skimped on battles, I did NOT expect it to be that epic.  That puts a lot of blockbuster movies to shame. Combined with the dialog and the fact GRRM wrote this episode and preserved everything that was awesome, this was one of the best hours of television ever.
I think my favorite aspect of that episode..and there were many great ones.....was Stannis leading the charge and showing what a badass he is. I think GRRM wanted to really illustrate to us since he hadn't really had a chance to do that in the books as much.  
I could watch this episode 3 times in a row as much as I hate the outcome.
620	ckal	2012-05-28	Onions4all-
I agree about GRRM and Stannis and I've already watched the ep twice. I'm sure I'll watch it again tmrw =)
My brother was so upset after watching it. He hates the Lannisters (well mainly Cersei and Joffrey, he likes Tywin and Tyrion). I haven't seen him that upset since Ned Stark misplaced his head....

623	J_Crews	2012-05-28	Yes, I was just responding to the user who said they didn't think it was the Kingsguard.Right.  I was just adding my voice to yours, saying you were correct, basically.
624	Triskan	2012-05-28	Stupid Question of the Day; Part 2:
-I forget how this relates to the books, but based on the warning that Varys gives Tyrion, are we to believe that the King's Landing folks should feel much relieved the Melisandre was not a part of the Blackwater?
625	Hear Us Roar	2012-05-28	I had my doubts but they put them to rest.

627	DarkWingsDarkWords	2012-05-28	Question: was Stannis being apprehended at the end by the castle wall defenders when the men were in full retreat or was it his own men ushering him away? I wasn't sure about that because of the position he was in; it would make it nigh impossible for him to reach the boats for an escape. In any case if they did capture him that would completely alter events later in the books. I will have to sing the same chorus as you all in saying that was by far the best episode ever. The only way to top that is to show the wildlings lay siege to the wall in a future season to come.
628	Sir Cadogan	2012-05-28	Have you guys seen the preview for ep10? SHIT, Sir Jorah's shout gave me THE chills.

He can't be held captive in King's Landing unless they are really going to change his story.  I think Stannis was just irate with his men and wanted to keep pressing on but the battle was lost so his men were forcing him back.  Again, mad props to him.  He would have fought 'til he died.
631	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-05-28	Altho the scene wasn't in the books, i LOVED the scene where Sandor is in the middle of the batter and watching in absolute horror the burning soldier.  Then Bronn shoots the guy and Sandor just....stands there with this look on his face.  We know from the books that he has a melt moment and ditches....but the actor really showed it.  His eyes, his face....it was soo moving.
The epiphany he had there....you didn't need to see and hear him tell them "fuck you".  You didn't think "oh he's a coward"...you just knew he.....changed.  It was a very moving scene to watch and made the followup scenes with Sansa later make more sense.

It was a very moving scene to watch and made the followup scenes with Sansa later make more sense.I just wonder if the Hound will have his transformation complete with Arya. They may skip that and have her Jarquen moment (in the preview) lead directly to Bravos/
633	Ser Arc	2012-05-28	Stannis' sword had no light nor heat. I guess Martin wanted to remind us again that either its a false Lightbringer or he's a false messiah.
Excellent, excellent episode.
634	Lebronn Jaime	2012-05-28	To sum up for those who may have missed it and might be inclined to nitpick:-Ser Mandon slashed Tyrion. He still has his nose, though.-Loras wore Renly's armor (no Garlan to be seen) and led the vanguard against Stannis's men. It's not 100% clear if Stannis saw him or not, to be honest, but it sure looked like he was seeing a ghost at one point.-The Hound cut one person in half length-wise and another in half height-wise. /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />-We heard parts of The Rains of Castamere. Twice! Once as a drinking song and once during closing credits.-We saw both red and green flames among the ships because while wildfire burns green, sails and wood still burn red-orange.-I'm not sure if Cersei said she was 4 or "(a) fool" when her mother died. I'm going to choose to believe I heard the latter. Accents!-No Salladhor Saan this episode. Consequently we don't see Stannis's escape at all, though we do see his men running for the ships.-Stannis was being pulled away from the battlements by his own men. His fury simply wouldn't allow him to leave his throne behind under his own power.-Lightbringer wasn't burning or even glowing, but it decapitated a guy pretty damn well. In the end that's what you really want out of your legendary swords.

635	towerofjoy	2012-05-28	There's no way Arya and the hound don't make it to the Twins.
636	Harrad	2012-05-28	There's no way Arya and the hound don't make it to the Twins.Yes, I suppose when the RW occurs next season, might as well add them to the mix. How soon in season 3?
637	jlk7e	2012-05-28	I just wonder if the Hound will have his transformation complete with Arya. They may skip that and have her Jarquen moment (in the preview) lead directly to Bravos/There is absolutely no chance they will do that.  Why on earth would they cut out Arya's entire Storm of Swords story?  She has the most chapters of any character in that book.  After Storm of Swords, she has five chapters where very little happens.-I'm not sure if Cersei said she was 4 or "(a) fool" when her mother died. I'm going to choose to believe I heard the latter. Accents!She said she was 4.  Are people really so emotionally committed to the age difference between Cersei and Tyrion to the point that they're willing to pretend they didn't change it on the show?  It's pretty obvious that Dinklage is not 9 years younger than Headey and Coster-Waldau, so this makes perfect sense.
638	Auska	2012-05-28	Wow. Terrible episode.
I had low expectations for the fighting but it turned out OK. The episode just did not engage me in any way.
639	rmholt	2012-05-28	Great Episode! It just flew by. Surprised to see Joff bust out the Valaryian sword. Surprised Lightbringer looked so ordinary except it just took off half that guys head. How can Stannis escape this? Can't wait to find out.Ummmmm not Valyrian.  Lannisters at this time have no Valyrian and Ser Ilyn has Ice.
640	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-05-28	I would have to say excluding the house with arya would be waaaay too much of a deviation
641	jlk7e	2012-05-28	Wow. Terrible episode.I had low expectations for the fighting but it turned out OK. The episode just did not engage me in any way.Seriously?  I kind of feel bad for you.
642	The  Halfhand	2012-05-28	You know that George R.R. wrote it when there was no mention of Ros when, just last episode, Cersei claims her as her prized prisoner.
643	sansabird	2012-05-28	I for one am glad he's keeping his nose. CGI budget would have been wasted on a Voldemort-esque transformation in my opinion. The Rains of Castamere is now on repeat until I get tired of it. One of the best episodes so far.
644	rmholt	2012-05-28	I thought it was pretty clear that it was a member of the Kingsguard that slashed Tyrion. Tyrion first had that sigh of relief that he was there, then got a curious look on his face, then wham. Down.Plus, someone called him Mandon.  Big tipoff.
645	Ser Coffee The Bold	2012-05-28	I loved how Tyrion and Bronn looked at the wildfire-nuke they set off. First, they looked with surprise that it worked, then they looked away because it was too bright, and then they looked in amazement and horror. As a spectator to both sides one couldn't help but have mixed feelings. Book readers sympathize with both Davos and Tyrion, and that part of the story pits them directly against one another.
I know it didn't explicitly say it anywhere in the books, but I always sort of took it for granted that Loras was Renly's ghost. 
Who else but Loras would lead the Tyrell vanguard to save the king? His father wanted his daughter to marry the king, and the suit fit!
This better win someone at least one Emmy, it was the best hour of TV I've seen in a long time.
646	Harrad	2012-05-28	There is absolutely no chance they will do that.  Why on earth would they cut out Arya's entire Storm of Swords story?  She has the most chapters of any character in that book.  After Storm of Swords, she has five chapters where very little happens.So, somewhere after 2015 when they catch up to where the books are now, HBO will still be supporting the effort? I wouldn't use the words "absolutely no chance." I would miss it but there's a lot that could be cut for the series to arrive at the current state considerably faster than 3 years from now.. We just have to wait and see.
647	Auska	2012-05-28	Seriously?  I kind of feel bad for you.Yeah. It was just there, got nothing out of it. Glad everyone else seems to have enjoyed it, though!Queued it up for a rerun just in caseâ<U+0080>¦
648	jlk7e	2012-05-28	I loved how Tyrion and Bronn looked at the wildfire-nuke they set off.

Loras is fighting as himself.  I think the TV version makes more sense.
649	Lebronn Jaime	2012-05-28	I know it didn't explicitly say it anywhere in the books, but I always sort of took it for granted that Loras was Renly's ghost.It was explicitly said by Loras that his brother Garlan was Renly's Ghost because he fit Renly's armor better.
650	Harrad	2012-05-28	. Finally, if they had just put a little more effort into showing Renly in some really unique armor earlier in the season then the arrival of the "ghost" would have held some weight. As it was, my father looked at me and said, "who is this now?" Even after they showed Loras and Tywin he had no idea Loras was wearing Renly's armor.Right! Was he wearing the antlered crown? Wihtout reading the books that was unknowable.
651	sansabird	2012-05-28	In the books, Garlan, Loras's older brother, is Renly's ghost.  Loras is fighting as himself.  I think the TV version makes more sense.I loved this change from the books. I loved how the helm had the antlers too. And the first time I read it I was confused as to who it was. I think it will help the non book readers understand it a bit better and hopefully later we'll get the "when the sun is gone no candle can replace it" line. It's one of my favorites.
652	DurararaFTW	2012-05-28	It sounded like she said four too.I liked the bit about Tywin believing in the Gods but not trusting them.Last week Joff said Stannis never smiles, now Tywin is the one that doesn't like Gods. Are Tywin and Stannis gonna keep trading character traits?In the books, Garlan, Loras's older brother, is Renly's ghost.  Loras is fighting as himself.  I think the TV version makes more sense.Well in the books Renly is quite a bit taller then Loras.
653	The Knight of Flours	2012-05-28	Thanks a lot. I am going over seas to Germany for work next month, and I plan on buying them to take along.Maybe just get the e-books as otherwise you may be charged for excess baggage! lol
654	timstanton	2012-05-28	@ ckal and craven mummers
sorry,  i stepped away for a moment. to clarify, i was referring to the table of contents in the kindle version, when i read CoK the table of contents was all names. in SoS the table of content are numbers, however the individual chapters are still names, arya, jon, catlynn etc.

655	Terez	2012-05-28	For book readers: Anyone else think Martin's dropping hints for future books? I thought the Cersei-Sansa exchange where Cersei was talking about Sansa being a "younger, beautiful" queen(that's what I took it as anyway), seemed like a hint on that prophecys front?That's a good one. The one I picked up had to do with Varys and Tyrion.I don't trust Varys. Not at all. That early scene with him and Tyrion, the way he spoke about dark magics... I know his whole story, and why he would be bothered by magic, but I don't trust him.I think he was being honest. Melisandre's magic is indeed very dark, and we know that Varys' loyalties are to the Targaryen family. I think that we got a hint on that front:The Dark Arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies, and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne....I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him.What is he getting at? Perhaps it's just having discovered Varys' loyalties in ADWD, but it definitely hit me as a hint in that direction, since we know Aerys had a thing for Tyrion's mother, and there are other hints as well that Tyrion might have Targaryen blood. I looked in the books to see if that scene was there, and found this instead:"Men are such faithless creatures," he said by way of greeting.Tyrion sighed. "Who's the traitor today?"The eunuch handed him a scroll. "So much villainy, it sings a sad song for our age. Did honor die with our fathers?""My father is not dead yet."Was Varys trying to hint that Tyrion's father was dead? Since GRRM wrote the episode, I really have to wonder about that. I was hoping for a hint about Jon soon, but got one about Tyrion instead.I forget how this relates to the books, but based on the warning that Varys gives Tyrion, are we to believe that the King's Landing folks should feel much relieved the Melisandre was not a part of the Blackwater?Yes, that's very strongly implied in the books. And in the show, too, so far.
656	Jolene Brown	2012-05-28	All the acting was amazing, but as a Tommen loyalist, who hopes against hope he will 1) survive, 2) hold on to the Iron Throne somehow (I know, I know), I have to give credit to that little actor - he was awesome, holding his own with Lena Headey.  That was by far her best performance in the series - she just gets better and better and more and more comfortable with Cercei.  I liked how she was more of the Bitch Queen we remember but still somehow sympathetic, especially at the end.  And I felt like Rory McCann did as much as possible to make up for the Hound's missing moments this season - the main stuff really came through in this episode, and he did sort of convey that feeling that perhaps the Hound might want to kiss Sansa but in a way that wouldn't freak anyone out - much milder than in the books.  But I think if they want to add the unkiss later (they may not), it wasn't ruled out or anything.  I also really liked Lancel, although I wish they had let him fight a little more before the arrow - I remember him as being very brave in the book, which I thought was a nice surprise.
I loved the way they staged that final scene in the throneroom - the total dark emptiness of it in contrast to all the other places we've seen throughout the episode.  It'll be interesting to see if they use a different versions of the Rains of Castamere each time it appears.  
I hope this bodes well for the battle at the wall!  That should be epic next (?) season, if they can do it half as well as this!
657	The  Halfhand	2012-05-28	Ok, so I just watched through it again and noticed something.
It might just be me but the actor who plays the Baratheon soldier that tells Stannis "but...hundreds will die"(Stannis replies "thousands") looks almost exactly like the actor that played Renly Baratheon. When his voice cracks he even sounds like Renly. Anyone??
658	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-28	Nitpick: Hearteater isn't a Valyrian sword, it's just a normal sword. Widow's Wail is the Valyrian sword he gets as a wedding gift from Tywin (who melted down Ice /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' /> to make it and Oathkeeper). Thanks for clearing that up I got confused in the names I guess and Hearteater looked really sweet it looked like it had the gem in the hilt

659	801 Guilty Stark	2012-05-28	Been lurking since season one fucking love the books, always trolling the TWOW discussion and all that but it was the series that brought this GOAT(Greatest Of All Time) story into my life and Holy Fuckin Shit...... Epic!!!!!!!!
660	oracle86	2012-05-28	Was there an antler crown. Without that how was anyone to know it was supposed to be Renley?Yes, there were antlers on his helm. You can see it clearly during the battle scenes, and later in the throne room. Plus, Loras was riding a white horse- remember Renly's horse when he met Stannis? /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
661	MaximusDecimus	2012-05-28	Incredible episode really, but not impervious to nitpicking /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
Anyone got the same feeling that book readers got way much more from the episode than non-readers? For instance two examples:
1 - Mandon Moore: Am I the only one that thought that Mandon Moore was poorly introduced, and/or was poorly depicted in the scene where he slashed Tyrion? I mean, if I haven't read the books I wouldn't be sure about who he was. In the middle of all those armors, he din't stand out
2 - Renly ghost: The show made a point of showing Loras in an armor during the fight, but I doubt non book readers would know: 1 - This was Renlys armor 2- This was ANY armor at all.
Leaving these nitpicks behind, awesome episode, easily one of the best from GOT
662	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-28	In the books, Garlan, Loras's older brother, is Renly's ghost.  Loras is fighting as himself.  I think the TV version makes more sense.yes good memory I think Loras said something about how the armor wouldn't fit him
663	jlk7e	2012-05-28	Well in the books Renly is quite a bit taller then Loras.It's certainly perfectly logical for it to be Garlan, but it makes more emotional sense for it to be Loras, since he's the one with the deep connection to Renly.  Garlan (whom I actually like as a character) is just some dude we've never seen before.  I guess that Garlan is probably going to be written out of the series, which is too bad, but hopefully they can give some of his role in the story to Loras - having Loras be respectful to Tyrion and kind to Sansa would be totally reasonable, I think, since he's just kind of a petulant prick in the books.
664	The Eightieth Sentinel	2012-05-28	Wow. There are just so many high points in this episode.
I especially loved seeing Stannis FIGHT for the throne he thinks he deserves, only to be pulled back by his men. Beautiful TV.

I think they will be talking about Renlys ghost in upcoming episodes so those who didn't pick up on it will figure it out

667	Dragon of Valyria	2012-05-28	What an episode. Sophie Turner was MAGNIFICENT. As per usual, she kills every scene she's in. Both the devious insousciance with Joffrey and the terror when talking with Cersei--nailed it. I like that Sansa is basically this brave, angelic counterpart to the cynical, world-weary Cersei. While Cersei is losing it and attacking Lancel, Sansa thinks of the others and tries to buoy their spirits. What a queenly thing to do. Magnificent.
Oh, and I guess there was some green pyrotechnics, a manly Baratheon, and a catchy little tune too...

668	Honey Badger	2012-05-28	I liked that they used Loras for the Renly's Ghost scene, as that always made more sense than using Garlan.  I know Martin wanted to be accurate as Renly had Robert's large build, so sticking Loras' slight body in big green armor wouldn't fit, but they could have explained it away.  Painted or tinted some armor green to make a facsimile, stuffed the armor with leather or cloth to make it fit, something.
Mandon Moore was mishandled.  He very obviously made a go at Tyrion, and did it in front of witnesses.  Even in the din of battle, the books handled the awkwardness of murdering the Hand by having it be a private affair on some boats.  Also you can't tell the white/gold armor as none of it stood out besides the helm.  I could tell since I read the books, but I wonder about the noobs.
Everything else was cool.  I still think they needed the chain as one boat with wildfire shouldn't have been enough to force a landing.  Many ships with wildfire, as well as ballista and catapults with the green explosive forced Stannis to land, along with the chain.  What they gave us didn't explain the chain away, oh well. 
Tactically, no Stannis shouldn't have charged up the ladder.  You hang back and engage when you think the turning point is come.  Just how Tywin does things.  Still badass, though.
The lack of horses sucked during Tyrion's charge, but I guess that was a budget concern.  The halfman's wedge didn't come to fruition, although the chopping at the knee cap was a nice way to make up for it.
669	oracle86	2012-05-28	The battle itself was amazing.  No chain but blowing up the Blackwater more than made up for it.  The fighting itself was intesne and bloody and they wisely moved Stannis to the battlefield in this one.  I liked how he was incapable of giving a great speech, just "Come with me and take this city!"I wouldn't call him "incapable" of giving a great speech. Stannis is a direct man. I loved the way he said that sentence in such a matter-of-fact manner.
670	No true knight	2012-05-28	Ser Dontos still exists!  He's a terrible juggler.
Here's something subtle. Check out the scene where Joffrey tells Mandon Moore to represent the King on the battlefield. Moore nods, and they both glance at Tyrion. In the book, it's never made clear exactly who sent Ser Moore after Tyrion (Tyrion thinks it's Cersei).  Just like the showwriters had Joffrey and not Cersei give the order to kill Robert's bastards, it looks like they also had Joffrey give the order to kill Tyrion! In fact, Joffrey only leaves the battle because he gets cold feet... it seems like Joffrey's original plan might have been to do in his uncle himself (with Moore providing backup support if things got hectic).  And then have Sansa kiss the bloody sword.
671	Social Justice Bass	2012-05-28	Holy shit, that episode was great. I just watched it twice on HBO GO, back-to-back. I think I might watch it again, on my TV On Demand tomorrow (so it doesn't eat up too  much data). What can I say? The Varys exposition was a little slow, but really improved on the second watch-through. The wildfire explosion was fucking amazing on both watch-throughs - poor Davos. Stannis is a complete badass, first on to the beach, first up the ladder, fighting several guys at once on the ledge. We never get to see that in the books, because all of his personal fighting in the battles happens off-screen. Sansa and Cersei both nailed it (and I loved the weird sexual tension that was between the Hound and Sansa, like in the books).
672	nara	2012-05-28	She definitely said 4.  In the books she and Jaime are 9 years older, so Tyrion has been aged up, which seems like more rehab is going to be done to Cersei's character.  The Red Viper tells Tyrion about how Cersei twisted baby Tyrion's penis:  certainly a 4 year old won't be doing that.  I hope. /ack.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':ack:' />Similarly, I don't think that Cersei and Jaime's mom will catch them "playing" and try to separate them before she dies.
673	oracle86	2012-05-28	Does anyone else feel like the actor playing Loras evolved dramatically from S1 to S2?  It's almost like it's a different person (and i'll be really embarrassed if someone comes in right now with "duh, you fucking idiot.  they recast him.").He seemed like such an androgen in S1 and not nearly as much here (not just tonight's episode, but the middle episodes too).Who is an "androgen"? I thought it referred to male sex hormones, but you seem to have used it in an entirely different context. Or perhaps, did you mean "androgynous"?
674	WillH	2012-05-28	Just to echo what others have said, wow what an episode.  Neil Marshall and George RR Martin need to do the red wedding, the two of them knocked it out of the park.  The buildup and pacing were expertly done and so many characters shined.
The show actually got me to read the books.  Right after Catelyn took Tyrion hostage in season 1, I went out and bought book 1 and I crushed all 5 before the second season even started! /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />  Now I am really enjoying the show that much more knowing the depth of the books. The adapation stuff doesn't bother me at all, I guess since I came in as a fan from the show to begin with (and also I know how bad most adaptations are).  I think they have done a brilliant job keeping the essence of the books and the entire cast and crew really deserve the upmost praise for it.  
I just re-started Clash of Kings, this time with the Roy Doltrice audio books, so I'm getting to enjoy it in a third awesome way /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />  I'm glad I read it first, but the audio books are a great way to come back to them, since I can get work done while listening /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />  Looking forward to posting more on this forum

675	sennahoj	2012-05-28	This was a really great episode, and I am really surprised how well the battle measured up to those filmed with a much bigger budget (such as Helm's Deep or Pelennor Fields). It was superbly done. I cannot see how they could've done the battle more justice on the show's budget. For that alone this episode should be given an award.
676	HouseLark	2012-05-28	A visceral episode. Before airing I was concerned that there were no real stakes for viewers since Stannis' character has been underdeveloped. But three characters absolutely saved it: Tyrion, Sansa and the Hound. The stories of those three were so well done that they raised the stakes. Tyrion has always had a well-written story but Sansa and the Hound have been given scraps really. But with Blackwater both had solid emotional arcs and the actors both nailed it. The Hound was especially good, to see that fear of the flames and all his courage desert him was incredible. I know everyone is banging on about GRRM writing this episode and I don't buy the argument that the other writers aren't up to scratch. But GRRM "gets" Sansa and the Hound in a way that the other writers don't.
I should add that I don't give a damn about the "SanSan" thing which I find irritating in the extreme. I believe that Sansa serves another purpose for the Hound, their joint story is not about any sort of relationship, but I won't go into that here, it's more of a book discussion.
There's a few loose ends which will be cleared up next week (Tywin, Tyrell, Mandon Moore). It would have been great to have this as a two-hour season finale and when I watch this back on DVD in the future I'm sure that's how I'll view it.
Excellent.
677	Happy Ent	2012-05-28	Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m less overwhelmed by the fighting scenes than many others. I understand the limitations of budget, but the infantry skirmishes always feel like brawls, not epic battles between trained soldiers.
Otherwise, a fine hour of television. TV-Stannis is not book-Stannis (who is calm and stubborn, not fierce), but it worked here.
I think Tywinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s final line could have been something better, instead of having him state the obvious, that they won. Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s beneath Tywin. He should have scolded Cersei for sitting the in throne, or something. â<U+0080><U+009C>Why is not King Joffrey sitting the Iron Throne?â<U+0080><U+009D>
The first Castameres (in the bar) was musically competent and proper for the period.
Loras seems be become a composite character of Loras and Garlan.
678	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	QFT.Favorite part? Practically impossible to choose.Easy. Stannis chopping the top of a guy's head off. I literally went OOOH YEEAAH ^^How are they going to get Stannis out of there? He is still on the battlements when Tywin gets there?The same way he got *on* the battlements. The road back to the ships will be littered with guys who have their brains cut out ^^Stannis' sword had no light nor heat. I guess Martin wanted to remind us again that either its a false Lightbringer or he's a false messiah.Lightbringer would have looked cool but would cost a lot of money to do I think, not to mention George was making a clear point showing Stannis murderate so many guys (after all he did write it), some of it would have been lost if it had been clear he was using a magical sword I think.Rory McCann slew both literally and figuratively, easily the best actor in this episode IMO. The Rains of Castamere was a great addition as well.This easily beats huge CGI battles the likes of Lotr and Narnia. The men vomiting, the tension before the battle, the Hound's fear... the screaming men, the horrible way people get killed (like the guy getting his head knocked off), it captured the sense of a *real* battle and reminds us that soldiers and warriors are people and war is a horrible thing for both sides rather than the 'happy battle' scenes that are more popular / common.

680	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2012-05-28	Hound saying fuck this and getting drunk was awesome.
681	Ice Turtle	2012-05-28	Stannis being dragged from the battlefield though he still wanted to fight, even after everything was lost. Damn that is Stannis.
682	nara	2012-05-28	Perhaps Renly's armor was not meant to be a plot point for the show, but just inserted subtly for book readers to enjoy...
683	Little Miss Sunshine	2012-05-28	NOW THIS IS WHAT I CALL AN EPISODE!!!
That wildfire explosion was something! My jaw just dropped and fell and rolled on the floor and I took my time to pick it up... Beautiful!!! Money very well spent /thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' />
Stannis grin, all the (few) Davos moments, every Tyrion scene, Cersei's story to Tommen (fucking amazing, I got the chills and teary eyes when she was speaking)... I'm totally speechless!
And I loved the last scene when Loras was using Renly's armour (of course they wouldn't waste an actor for Garlan when they could to this)... and Bronn and the men singing the Reynes of Castamere was really nice, I say!
Excellent episode all the way! /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
684	Rhodan	2012-05-28	I really had some problems with the last two or three episodes, but this made up for them million times! Yes, the wildfire scene was result of cheap simplification but it was totally with the spirit of adaptation so far and effective nonetheless. Though, if I understand corectly, this means royal fleet wasnÂ´t destroyed and thus would be actually ready at least siege Dragonstone?
685	legba11	2012-05-28	Yeah, I know. It's really no big deal. I like to hear what you guys have to say.Rosebud is a sled.I just wonder if the Hound will have his transformation complete with Arya. They may skip that and have her Jarquen moment (in the preview) lead directly to Bravos/I am thinking we see Arya get grabbed by the Hound as her last moment of episode 10.Right! Was he wearing the antlered crown? Wihtout reading the books that was unknowable.He's not wearing the antlered crown, he is wearing a helmet with a small stag sigil on the front.  I don't think he's wearing the same armor, compare the still on page 6 with the shots of Renly at the meeting, the distinct piece of Renly's armor (the gold piece under his neck) is not visible.
686	Wjaykusuma	2012-05-28	Stannis is bad ass! /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
But,there were no 'chains' /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
687	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-28	I have to give it too them on this episode. Sure i can nitpick some things but they really came through. Did they need fire arrows? No but they just looked so cool it had to be done that way. Of particular importance to me was showing that Tyrion had some brilliant ideas for the defense of the city considering they couldn't have the chain. They had the boat full of wildfire with Bronn lighting it with a magnificent shot. Him working with Varys to find another way out to the mudgate worked as well. I still liked the original storyline better but with the limitations they were facing they still got the main character points right on. Thats how you adapt. Somethings bothered me this season but I was truly satisfied with this episode.
688	DurararaFTW	2012-05-28	I really had some problems with the last two or three episodes, but this made up for them million times!

689	legba11	2012-05-28	Watched the scene on HBO Go to see if they talk about it.  They say it's Renly's armor, but oddly the only two ways you could identify it, the crown (Loras is wearing a helm) and the gold piece under the neck (which is only visible slightly under cloth) are not shown.  Renly also wore cloth across his front armor, but under the gold piece, so you could see it.  Odd choice to do something, but make it completely unviewable.  Also odd from watching it closely, the stag horns appear much larger in the brief glimpse we have of Loras on the battlefield fighting, they seem to actually go outside the helm, but in the still and in the throne room (where he takes it off), it appears to just be a small sigil imprinted on the helm.
On a side note, does anyone know how to force a higher resolution on HBO go?  My goes back and forth from high to low.
690	Roose Seal	2012-05-28	Minor complaint : When I read the battle, I pictured a true inferno of flames, as if they were caught fighting inside a furnace. It made the Hound's fear a little more believable. Here he was like "aah a burning guy! I must flee!"
Other than that, awesome episode. Stannis being in the thick of the action was a brilliant idea and the Wildfire explosion was pretty damn cool.
691	Spidey	2012-05-28	The SanSan scene from the book just wouldn't work on TV.  The tension builds from not knowing what the Hound is doing because Sansa has her eyes closed. 
Obviously, on TV we would be able to see that she's not in danger.
692	Le Cygne	2012-05-28	Now that's an adaptation!  That's what I've been wanting to see all season and haven't.  Staying true to the characters and the spirit of the book while not only adapting to a visual medium, but creating an exquisite viewing experience.
It can be done and he did it.  If only he'd written them all.

695	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-28	Bit of a shame Davos got knocked off early, but eh. It did add to the "menace," I suppose, having Stannis's main man out of action for the waning moments of the fight. 
Still. He looked badass flying off Black Betha with his cape snapping...
696	ServantOnIce	2012-05-28	Minor complaint : When I read the battle, I pictured a true inferno of flames, as if they were caught fighting inside a furnace. It made the Hound's fear a little more believable. Here he was like "aah a burning guy! I must flee!"Other than that, awesome episode. Stannis being in the thick of the action was a brilliant idea and the Wildfire explosion was pretty damn cool.I think that was as Martin talked about writing fantasy and human actuality. Such as in the book The Wheelhouse being too big to fit into Winterfell's main gates, but in reality constructing it would be way too costly. If the fire was a nasty as it was in the books technically the suffocating fumes would have made life in King's Landing improbable folks would have been indoors and the battle would have ceased, the heat, the air . . nothing would have happened at that point both sides would have to stand back.  I thought tonight's battle episode was realistic, huge flames, but not over done, fire, blood, and sword. The three battle elements of Martin's wonderful song.
697	Ghost714	2012-05-28	Without them showing Sansa meeting with Dontos in the godswood, and him "planning to take her home", it was a little weird that she didn't go with Sandor. Especially because he said he would keep her safe and take her home to Winterfell. I mean right after that, Sansa said you won't hurt me, as a statement, so of she didn't think Sandor would hurt her, then why not go with him? 
I liked seeing Stannis as a total badass, despite it being out of character, but at the same time I didn't like it. They showed Stannis kicking ass non stop, and he never got hurt, and he wasn't even wearing a helmet. I don't like how they are making him seem invincible because he "sold his soul to a demon". I really didn't like it when Varys was talking to Tyrion, and he said, "the dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his army's and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse, and tonight I believe you are the only man who can stop him". 
They are making Stannis seem like the evil monster, and Tyrion the galant white knight, and it's ridiculous. Stannis isn't evil, and Tyrion is not the perfect hero come to save the day. They are both suppose to be grey characters, and it would be much more interesting if they were actually like that in the show. Grey characters fighting grey characters is much more interesting than this black and white shit. Stannis is not evil, and neither is Melisandre, I don't get why they are making them out to be. 
And what I really don't get is that GRRM wrote this episode, and yet there are still these black and white characters. I mean it was dumb for Dan and Dave to do it in all the previous episodes, but for GRRM to do it also... That's just baffling to me, I really do not understand it.
Don't get me wrong, I loved this episode, and I think it was the best of the series. Sophie Turner has gotten so tall and beautiful, and she did so freaking good this episode. Sophie Turner's facial expressions were so good when she said, "I'm sorry, your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender". She totally schooled Joffrey in that scene. I can't express how much I loved it, and how good she did. 
I also really liked the dialogue between Sansa and Tyrion.
(Sansa) "I will pray for your safe return my Lord."
(Tyrion) "Will you?" 
(Sansa) "Just as I pray for the King's"
And she gave the slightest of smiles as she said "just as I pray for the King's", I was truly cheering  for Sansa.
It was hilarious how Joffrey was having Sandor talk to Tyrion, and Tyrion was having Lancel talk to Sandor, and Sandor talk to Joffrey.
I definitely believe the Bronn and Sandor stand off was GRRM tossing the fans a bone. Both of them where so badass. 
(Sandor) "your just like me... Only smaller"
(Bronn) "and quicker, ehh?." 
Gods those two were badass.I loved how Bronn shot the guy on fire coming at Sandor. They both had such good lines. Who was the guy that walked in and sat down with Sandor? 
I also really loved the lines between Tyrion and Bronn.
(Bronn) "don't get killed"
(Tyrion) "nor you my friend"
(Bronn) "oh, are we friends now?"
(Tyrion) "of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship"
(Bronn) "enhances it, really"
(Tyrion) "oh enhances. Fancy word for a Sellsword"
(Bronn) "been spending time with fancy folks"
Truly golden.
And what was up with Cersei's corset/breastplate thing? It was as useless as boobs on a breastplate...ok I am done...(I know the saying is "useless as nipples on a breastplate", but Cersei literally had boobs on hers)
698	Little Miss Sunshine	2012-05-28	Bit of a shame Davos got knocked off early, but eh.

699	ServantOnIce	2012-05-28	@Ghost714  That  was  the only time that Joffrey and Tyrion were ever in agreement. Joffrey and Tyrion both were, "Sandor, get out there and get to fighting, you like killing, you like fighting, go out there and do both!"	They need to add a new "swag"  The Sandor walk off Swag . .

Trying to figure out whether the red wedding will be in the next season.I don't think they've been released other than Martin's episode, which is 7, Autumn Storms.Without them showing Sansa meeting with Dontos in the godswood, and him "planning to take her home", it was a little weird that she didn't go with Sandor. Especially because he said he would keep her safe and take her home to Winterfell. I mean right after that, Sansa said you won't hurt me, as a statement, so of she didn't think Sandor would hurt her, then why not go with him?They changed it to Shea's explaining how she will be safe when Stannis takes the keep.  Which makes complete sense, Stannis would not hurt Sansa, he would treat her as a valuable, high-born lady hostage.  To be honest, to be in KL, as a valuable hostage of Stannis might be one of the most secure places you could be during this war

Oh, and Stannis~ why so badass? He was practically the only one fighting on the wall! /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' /> /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />
702	HouseLark	2012-05-28	Perhaps Renly's armor was not meant to be a plot point for the show, but just inserted subtly for book readers to enjoy...Definitely, it's an easter egg, nothing more. It's not much of a plot point anyway but those little nods to the book fans are nice. There's no way that any non-book reader would think of Renly at that point.

-Sansa. The actress was great.And this line:
"I will pray for your safe return my Lord"
"Will you?"
"Just as I pray for the King's" and her conversation with Joffrey.Loved it!
-Cersei finally acting like Cersei! Lena Headley was amazing.
-Tywin's arrival, Loras removing his helm.
-The rains of Castamere: Very pleasantly surprised to hear it.
-I loved Stannis  at the end.

I thought tonight's battle episode was realistic, huge flames, but not over done, fire, blood, and sword. The three battle elements of Martin's wonderful song.Can a sword really slice the top of a head clean off like Stannis' did ? I doubt so. I'm not expecting GoT to be a historically accurate depiction of the War of the Roses, thus don't really care much about the science behind the battles or logic behind the tactics. The book made it sound like the river was literally on fire and I distinctly remember having a feeling of suffocation while reading that scene...Actually the characters in the show itself mention the river being on fire a few times but after the initial wildfire explosion (which, admittedly, was spectacular) we really really don't get a sense of anything being on fire except a couple guys on the shore.That was my only complaint in an otherwise amazing episode.

709	Husband to Bears	2012-05-28	Bringing Roy back as Pyromaniac Hallene was perfect. The looks he had when watching the Wildfire burn would of made Aerys proud.  There was one shot where you saw Tyrion's pain for his decision to use Wildfire and then he turns to see Roy's shit eating grin and Joffrey's look of glee.  Good stuff.
710	FantA´me	2012-05-28	They'll probably keep in tradition and have the most surprising and epic (not in a good way this time) part of the book in the 9th episode.I think it would be better that way or non-readers may hope Robb or Cat survived or something.
711	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	They showed Stannis kicking ass non stop, and he never got hurtHe was hit by a rock when climbing the ladder. You know, what makes those scenes so awesome is that he genuinely fought like a real knight, kicking and punching and using his body to knock guys down and away from him. He also gripped his sword by the blade with his off hand a couple of times, which is a less well-known but actually rather common style. There's clearly a very good action director behind this.Can a sword really slice the top of a head clean off like Stannis' did?Technically, yes, practically it would be difficult.
712	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-28	Davos is the man, ser. It is so f**** known /sleep.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='-_-' />http://i.imgur.com/SKV5t.gif/sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />Poor Matthos. I'm sure they built up Salladhor so he can pick up Davos in the sea though, in either episode ten or S3.
713	DurararaFTW	2012-05-28	Well they had too distinquish Lightbringer somehow.
714	Arya The Assassin	2012-05-28	This is the most thrilling and exciting episode so far! Some episodes in season 2 had better (or more memorable) dialogue scenes, but overall I think this episode ranks as the best so far this season.I wasn't quite sure what to expect, because the episode had been hyped up so much, and I wanted to keep my feet on the ground. But I knew that GRRM had written the episode, and I'd seen all of Neil Marshall's action films, so I felt pretty confident that I wouldn't be disappointed, and I wasn't.I did miss Arya, but it's perfectly understandable that she doesn't appear in this episode, since all the action is centered around the Battle of the Blackwater (I realized early on that Arya wouldn't appear, because Maisie's name wasn't mentioned during the opening credits).Good:More Sansa scenes. I particularly liked the scene with Sansa and Sandor. Sansa looked pretty wearing her new dress (which looked much better than her old dress).The wildfire explosion. The explosion exceeded my expectations by far, it was really well done. You could see the ships being ripped apart by the blast. There were some great shots there as well. The entire sequence (including the build-up) was well directed.Lots of carnage. People being cut in half, skulls being sliced off, etc.The battle scenes were well directed and even though they had to work with a limited budget and limited resources, they still managed to add a sense of scale to the shots. It's definitely one of the best (if not the best) battle I've seen in a TV show.They focused not only on the battle, but on Sansa's and the queen's situation as well. It gave the viewer (particularly people who've never read the books) a better understanding of what would happen if they lost the battle.Bad:My only nitpick is that a couple of scenes seemed a bit hurried. For example, when Tyrion and his men attack the enemy at the city gates, the fight is over almost before it begins.
715	boojam	2012-05-28	We know where Jamie is, Sandor , Meryn Trant and Mandon Moore
why aren't the other three king's guard at the battle?
Two of them did not seem to be guarding the queen.

718	Darth Visenya	2012-05-28	What a great episode!!, my only one complaint was the unrealistic damage some of the swords did but that was likely just for effect, can't wait for next week.

720	VaramyrSixchins	2012-05-28	Any man dies with a clean sword, I will rape his fucking corpse! Possibly the greatest line in the history of battle scenes.
721	Arataniello	2012-05-28	This was definitely a step up from the prior episodes, either because it didn't include huge chunks of stuff that wasn't in the books, or else because GRRM was more involved in it.
Even so, it was a shame that the Sandor and Sansa scene was so curtailed.
Favorite lines of the episode
Varys - I am not entirely sure what you mean.
Tyrion - I am entirely sure you are entirely sure what I mean.
722	SerJerTheUnchaste	2012-05-28	Can't wait to re-watch the episode later today with my sister who missed it. A few more thoughts:I've seen people mentioning a difference in the actor who plays Loras. I've seen two: first, he's gained weight from last season. I'd say at least 10-15 lbs. Second, in season 1 Loras was cocky (no pun intended, lol) and confident in every scene he's in. Here we first see him after being defeated by Brienne and then when his King is being questioned by Cat and after his King is dead. Very different circumstances.Anyone else notice how brilliant the lighting was in this episode? Particularly on Tyrion's face? There were at least two shots of him that were just amazing.The best episodes this season did not come from B&W and I hope they realize that. I totally get the need to change some things for the sake of translating these large books to screen but there's too many instances this season of characters' personalities jumping around because of lazy writing (Cersei was the worst) and leaving out little things that would not have cost money, mean a lot to book readers, and really do add to the story because GRRM knows what he's doing (in example: Renly's peach offering to Stannis.) At times, it seems like they were locked in a room with a clock ticking and told to write several episodes before poisonous gas was released; which led them to not have the time or care to think through the long-range consequences of some of the changes.In relation to the above point, I wonder if any of the actors get any input on their scenes? It was well noted that during the filming of LotR, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Christopher Lee, and others carried around well-worn copies of the book and would push for certain lines or moments to be included. This overall love for the book and collaboration between all involved help make it a very successful translation that, for me at least, included nearly all of the little moments that touched me as a reader. I would imagine on GoT the pace and schedule might be even more hectic than a movie set so maybe that wouldn't be possible but it could help retain more of GRRM's small touches that we all love.
723	legba11	2012-05-28	As for S3, I think they will manipulate the timeline a bit and give us the purple wedding to end Season 3, with the Red Wedding in Ep8.  S4 (at KL) will cover the aftermath (moving the arrival of Dorne to S4 since you need the Red Viper later).  I am hoping they learn from the good and bad from S2 and keep things focused more.  Save the Wall major stuff for S4.  This plan would also give them "happy" endings for 2 seasons in a row (Purple Wedding and then Stannis's face turn), after downers ending S1 (we got dragons, but the emotion was Khal Drogo's death) and S2 (Winterfell burning).
724	legba11	2012-05-28	in season 1 Loras was cocky (no pun intended, lol)Thanks for the spit take all over my monitor.
725	7V3N	2012-05-28	This is why I stuck with this disappointing season with confidence. Thank you GRRM, that was beautiful. The battle, the dialogue, the epic-ness. All great. I love how much time there was devoted to the Hound and Bronn. Two secondary characters, but definitely two of my favorite characters.
My one complaint: Stannis was the first one to touch the shores? Stannis being the first to scale the walls? Stannis argued when the retreat was necessary? Stannis would not act like that. He would know when/if the retreat it necessary and take it. He is objective in his own Stannisy way. But hell, GRRM wrote it.

This plan would also give them "happy" endings for 2 seasons in a row (Purple Wedding and then Stannis's face turn), after downers ending S1 (we got dragons, but the emotion was Khal Drogo's death) and S2 (Winterfell burning).It's just me ... but I love the stuff in the East. Man how are they going to get all that in two seasons?Of all the scenes in all five novels that surprised me the most was DRACARYS. When I read the lead up to that I thought"No way in hell Dany's gonna get out this."Then she (well George) surprised the crap out of me!I hope D and D can get HBO to pony up for that one.
732	Greywolf2375	2012-05-28	Ummm - looked to me like he got shot on the right and punched on the right.  Darn now I have to watch it AGAINCersei did punch him on the left side.  I've never been shot with an arrow, but since it happened like 1/2 an hour before this, I'd assume that even getting hit on...anywhere...on the upper body would hurt since he still has a hole in his shoulder.
733	7V3N	2012-05-28	I just wanted to point out how funny the "Stannis would never lead the charge!" comments are when you consider that the man who invented Stannis and knows him better than anybody wrote the episode,I think the complaint is that a king would not lead the charge (even Robb is surrounded by his own men). I say in my post that my complaints are all moot because it is all coming from the source, but it still seemed out of place. I think it was a classic "give them a show" scene. Why would we want to see some bannerman storming the shores and climbing the walls?
734	Crown	2012-05-28	Could someone set up a pre-airing discussion thread for Valar Morghulis, can't be arsed to do it myself right now.

When I read the lead up to that I thought"No way in hell Dany's gonna get out this."Then she (well George) surprised the crap out of me!I hope D and D can get HBO to pony up for that one.Dany is one of my favorite characters in the book (and who I want to sit the IT at the end).  Her story will certainly be kept (it is probably the second best storyline of SoS, after Jaime/Brienne.).  However, since they split the book, they should take advantage of that and focus on less stories each season, and keep the others simmering in the background.  Having Dany simmer for Season 3 will also give time for her dragons to grow (though I expect they will be grown by the warlocks in Ep10 anyway).  Or you could make it part of season 3 and have it simmer in season 4, that may actually make more sense, since season 4 simmering, we could begin to see her as a true queen as she rules.  Look how strong this episode was, party because of all the action, but also due to focus.  It was one story and scenes had time to be fully developed.
736	HouseLark	2012-05-28	Can a sword really slice the top of a head clean off like Stannis' did?There's some callback to the beheading of Ser Rodrik here. If you recall it weakened Theon's character when he couldn't carry out the execution cleanly - it didn't just speak of his physical strength it also said that he wasn't ready to lead, his position was false. The gruesome scene in Blackwater told you about Stannis, his physical strength, his ability, and it alluded to his strength of character.Also, this was discussed in a scene from Spartacus: Vengeance earlier this year.
737	shadow of death	2012-05-28	Looked to me like Stannis also has the bad ass kill mother fuckers on the battlefield gene that big brother Robert had.
Yes it was unrealistic that the king would be the 1st guy on shore and up a ladder but it was pretty bad ass and fun to watch!
738	Arya The Assassin	2012-05-28	The tag blackwater is trending on Twitter, it looks like GoT viewers on Twitter were amazed by the episode:Realtime results for #Blackwater
739	StannisWins	2012-05-28	I have to say that I had never heard of SanSan until last night. I had thought that I&F was immune to the shipper crap that almost ruined Lost fandom. Guess I was wrong. :-/
740	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	I think the complaint is that a king would not lead the charge (even Robb is surrounded by his own men). I say in my post that my complaints are all moot because it is all coming from the source, but it still seemed out of place. I think it was a classic "give them a show" scene. Why would we want to see some bannerman storming the shores and climbing the walls?No one had a problem with it when Robert or Robb did it. Or Victarion. Sansa even comments on it, and the importance of a King fighting alongside his men is stressed many times by Tyrion on the matter of Joffrey to 'prepare' us for this scene, so to speak. It was brilliantly set up really, and I loved the juxtapose between Joffrey's sniveling and Stannis' badassery. Jaime, too, leads from the front. In this case, it was GRRM cleverly showing Stannis' pragmatism in combat. They've just taken a huge hit, their field commander appears to have died, his men were showing doubt... So Stannis decides to lead the charge (also surrounded by his own men, he was in front but it's not like he was way ahead of them), much in the same way Tyrion decided to lead his men to inspire them. It also has something to do with how the battle was adapted: here the attack came directly from the sea, in the books the army was split in two parts by the river they had to cross to attack the wall and they had great difficulties in getting across. It makes more sense for him to lead here where Stannis is able to land himself and a large portion of his army relatively securely and there is not an army still behind him that needs directions.

741	ServantOnIce	2012-05-28	@Shadow of Death.  That is true . .  maybe someone with a knowledge of primitive war fair, i.e. war fare of sword,  bashing  instruments and fire, can enlighten us?   It seems usually the commanders and kings were in the rear with the gear with only field captain types out there leading the troops.  I remmeber in "Rome" when  Marc Antony and Octavian were in the rear at the battle of Philippi.
742	Chelly	2012-05-28	This was amazing. One of the best episodes of the series so far, probably the best of the season. The wildfire scene was beautiful. What was actually happening was horrific, but the imagery of the green flames rising on the ships and on the black water was breathtaking.
Lena Headey really shown this episode. That scene with her and Tommen was superb. Everybody did great this episode for me, particularly the characters whose name starts with "s":  Sansa, Sandor, Stannis, and even Shae. Shae has become more likable these past few episodes. Its a shame we didn't get one or two more scenes between her and Tyrion like the one with them in bed this episode. It would have helped us understand why Tyrion has fooled himself into falling in love with her and cares deeply for her.
Sandor was also at his best. "Fuck the King" /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' /> Hell yeah. The confrontation between him and Bronn was great.
"Your just like me, only smaller." - Sandor
"And quicker, eh" - Bronn 
I'm ain't gonna front, though. I was expecting a little more from the Sansa bedroom scene. It was one of my favorite moments in the books, but I know it would not have translated well on screen. I just thought we would get at least a non-kiss, a sort of editing trick to give us a "did he or didn't he kiss her" like in the books with Sansa's fuzzy memory. Maybe that would be too much, I know that SanSan is not an endgame, but I saw the dynamic between them to be more of an important factor in their own personal development and character growth, for both Sansa and Sandor. I at least wanted her to touch his face or something to that effect.
Stannis was fucking incredible and unstoppable. Stephen Dillane really brought Stannis up a notch in my eyes. I loved his reaction to the wildfire. My favorite Stannis moment was right before they proceed to KL, he turns looks at his men, looks like he struggles to find something inspiring to say, and then goes "Come with me and take this city". LOL. Nowhere near as awesome as Tyrion's speech, but his conviction sold it.
Tyrion was the bomb. I loved him sneaking up behind the soldier and cutting him down. His "fuck me" was a line delivered perfectly. YAY for Podrick!!
743	StarkWard	2012-05-28	This episode had me crying. How can my heart maintain a quick pace of 60 minutes?! At first, I was apprehensive since there was still no blood spilt a quarter into the episode. You soon realize that all that build-up had a purpose.
Tyrion, once again, was a marvel. This is his episode as much as it was Cersei's. Some may take issue with the showrunners humanizing Tyrion too much, but I like him in this episode. He was afraid, but then it was a time that he was brave as well (See what I did there?). In his most unconventional pep talk, he tells the soldiers the truth rather than what they wanted to hear. He cuts legs! And he pulls off this gasp of what-the-F-just-happened when Ser Mandon attacks him.
Stannis is as straightforward as ever ("Hundereds will die." "Thousands."). There is really no doubt that Stannis is a good war leader. Fearless and leading in battle, a stark contrast to Joffrey hiding behind his mother's skirts (Gleeson's facial expressions are refreshing, btw.), and his look of despair while his men force him to fall back struck a cord in people's hearts. 
Sansa and Cersei have such a great dynamic. It really is great to see Cersei slowly geting inebriated, like a foreshadowing of her fall from grace. In a way, Shae's presumption that the Queen is jealous of Sansa rings true, because she is a younger, more beautiful would-be queen. Headey was fantastic (as well as her armour corset. cue: "I should have been a man."). One second, her words send shivers down your spine, and the next, she is a vulnerable woman. As much as we all know her true nature, you really cannot deny that Cersei loves her children. For a second there, I was genuinely glad to see Loras and Tywin.
I think it's amazing that audiences can feel a little romance tingling in the midst of a battle, and the SanSan dynamic is just that. This episode served for Sandor as well in seeing his two sides. He enjoys killing - he would've been quick to prove it in that heart-stopping confrontation with Bronn, but at the same night, he offers safety to a terrified Sansa, inspite of being afraid himself.
I don't think I have to mention, but I will anyway, how amazing the far shot of the wildfire explosion is. A bit queer though on how Davos recognized wildfire, in the misty night, mind you. I now get what D&D kept saying about the individual things that happen to people in a war. I know this one will be compared to Minas Tirith, but the approach is entirely different. You don't just see the troop movements and flanks. You get to see the war from all the people involved: the soldiers, the women, the servants, the squires. Everyone! Down to the last random burning seaman.
Blackwater had too many great lines that it would be a crime to mention any without quoting the whole script. It's enough to say that The Rains of Castamere will ring in my head for a fortnight.
That and "DRUUUUMS!".
744	Ciglon	2012-05-28	My one complaint: Stannis was the first one to touch the shores? Stannis being the first to scale the walls? Stannis argued when the retreat was necessary? Stannis would not act like that. He would know when/if the retreat it necessary and take it. He is objective in his own Stannisy way. But hell, GRRM wrote it.I think Stnnis leading the charge and being first up the ladder was one of those "can't resist" moments in writing a battle scene, where it just would've looked too awesome not to put in...Also, in the books Ser Axell Florent did have to convince Stannis that the day was lost and to retreat.
745	Harrad	2012-05-28	-Sansa. The actress was great.And this line:"I will pray for your safe return my Lord""Will you?""Just as I pray for the King's" and her conversation with Joffrey.Loved it!That line jarred me a bit. We know she prays for Joff to NOT return. So that implies she feels the same for Tyrion. Yet she and we know that Tyrion has saved her and taken her side when no one else did. It was clever writing but not entirely appropriate.
746	legba11	2012-05-28	I have to say that I had never heard of SanSan until last night. I had thought that I&F was immune to the shipper crap that almost ruined Lost fandom. Guess I was wrong. :-/Anyone mind translating that for me?  (I understand SanSan)Stannis had to lead the charge to provide the contrast with Joffery, especially after his "Thousands" comment.  A huge chuck of the episode (and previous speeches from Bronn and Littlefinger) established how morale of your men is probably the most important thing in a battle.  I am now disappointed we won't see this Stannis again until 4.10.  June 2014.
747	Winter's Knight	2012-05-28	Sansa: I shall pray for your safe return my lord.
Tyrion: You will?
Sansa: Just as I pray for King Joffery.
This episode...can't stop nerdgasming...need to lie down....
748	KnightsOfDany	2012-05-28	So this will be hard to write my mind is currently blown over the nearest wall so ill try....
This episode is the best hour of television ive ever seen in my life, and as a book fan it stayed very, very true to the book. I get there was no chain, and no sing song for Sandor but i think the alternatives worked well, i mean did you see that Wildfire explosion i think my jaw dropped just as everyone in the city did.
I wish they gave more incite into why the Kingsguard turned on Tyrion, the average fan probably was like WTF was that, in the book i had a sense of dread the whole latter half of the book with Tyrion. Otherwise Go POD! and a nice touch leaving the is he dead or no cliffhanger /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
All in all i was worried they were going to skip the Tywin/Renly Ghost for a second but got the instant relief. And my god was the credit song ever haunting is the RoC or something else? i would love to know thanks!
Fuck Water, Bring me Wine
749	JonHo	2012-05-28	That line jarred me a bit. We know she prays for Joff to NOT return. So that implies she feels the same for Tyrion. Yet she and we know that Tyrion has saved her and taken her side when no one else did. It was clever writing but not entirely appropriate.Tyrion maybe be the Lannister that treats her the bestbut he's still a Lannister.
750	The_Gallows_Knight	2012-05-28	Awesome episode. The only real complain I got is that Stannis sword wasn't fiery or whatever, which is such a minor complaint that it is pretty much irrelevant.
So let's list the sheer amount of badassitude and awesomeness of the ep.
- Stannis on the front line was great, a good contrast to Joffrey squirming away from the battle. King Stannis indeed.
- Bronn was extra awesome, singing Reynes of Castamere, bumping heads with The Hound, lighting the wildfire, saving The Hound and killing people with only a knife.
- The juxtaposition of Cersei / Tommen and the arrival of the Lannisters / Tyrells was great
- The scene with Davos ship being blown to hell was totally gut-wrenching.
- Tyrion fighting was handled nicely as was Ser Mandon's betrayal
- Renly's Ghost!
- And lastly awesome dialogue, Davos / Mathos, Tyrion / Varys, Tyrion / Bronn, Bronn / Sandor, Tyrion / Sansa, Sansa / Cersei, Tyrion / The troops, Bronn / the troops / prostitutes
Also a mention for everyones favourite Kingsguard, the honourable and valiant Ser Boros Blount.
Oh, and I forgot to mention, the drums were Epic!

751	Harrad	2012-05-28	All in all i was worried they were going to skip the Tywin/Renly Ghost for a second but got the instant relief.Sorry but I don't think this part lived up to the rest. As a book reader I was looking for the Renly ghost and even for me the scene was too quick, poorly shot, or obscure for that kind of recognition. For a non-book reader it must have been completely opaque. Also, the separation between the Tyrion's charge, Stannis' charge, and Renly's charge, especially the last two, would have also given no clarity to a non-book reader. In other words if you were not expecting that to happen, there is no way to know that it had happened. The Stannis forces in the charge after Tyrion faded away instantly. The editing there could have been vastly improved.
752	KnightsOfDany	2012-05-28	Here's the song guys!http://www.youtube.c...h?v=kOfTvtWYBekGoosebumps god this rendition was so bone chilling
753	niA±ostark	2012-05-28	I've been bitching the whole season, but not today...
fucking epic awesomeness... didn't miss the chain, fucking green explosion <3
754	legba11	2012-05-28	http://insidetv.ew.c...s-blackwater-2/D&D interview about this ep.A few little things:Tyrion and Bronn's conversation was great and really sets up Bronn's abandonment of him, and as the EW recapper put it, Tyrion has to buy his woman and his friend.  He could not be more sympathetic on the show.  After his speech and short-lived victory, I half expected him to be killed at the end of the episode.  Every step for the death of a hero sequence had been played out.Bronn's reaching for his dagger to fight Sandor.  Just great, Bronn knows he shouldn't go sword to sword with the bigger man in a crowded brothel, he is going to use a small weapon.
755	StarkWard	2012-05-28	Mandon Moore was mishandled.  He very obviously made a go at Tyrion, and did it in front of witnesses.  Even in the din of battle, the books handled the awkwardness of murdering the Hand by having it be a private affair on some boats.  Also you can't tell the white/gold armor as none of it stood out besides the helm.  I could tell since I read the books, but I wonder about the noobs.The helm he was wearing looked like that of the Kingsguard. Kind of like three curvy lines meeting at the face.
756	Fragile Bird	2012-05-28	I previously heard a number of complaints about the Rains of Castamere as sung at the end, but when I first heard it (before the episode aired) my immediate thought was they were trying for a very Leonard Cohen-type rendition, that air of world weariness Cohen imbues in his songs.  And the n hearing it at the end of the episode (ahem, three times) really brought out that weariness/wariness of what war and death are all about.  IMHO.

759	Robin Of House Hill	2012-05-28	Anyone else digging this song during the end credits?Not me.  After such a good episode, it was like a slap in the face.  All the other credits have had an orchestral, not a vocal background.  I would have preferred that they'd stuck with that formula.  Besides, Bronn's version was much more enjoyable for me.
760	JW.	2012-05-28	That Wildfire looks like some effective stuff.. makes you wonder how the Others would react to it. Install some catapults with that stuff on the wall, and tada?
761	Wyman's Man	2012-05-28	Quick question about the Rains of Castamere. Were the lyrics of the song ever mentioned in the books? I always remember at feasts like Joff's wedding that the song would be played, but I don't remember a specific instance where the lyrics were spelt out. Anyone have an idea?

After Bronn saved the Dog's life, poof he just kind of vanishes, or he was left outside the gate? Wouldn't Bronn be commanding the Gold Cloaks , who after all have the most fighting men in KL?*Lotta little short things like that which I would have included. Now Lena gave a Emmy winner this episode, but I could see where many two min. could have been chipped off her screen time , still giving her a ton of stuff. Added some other dialog.Example , the did away with Ser Imry Florent , fine, still have Davos suggest to Stannis , as in the novel to Imry, that they have Salador Sahn send one of his swift ships to recon for a trap, Stannis turns him down. I don't remember if Stannis found out about this later, but it makes Davos look like a genius.Lucian Msamati's contract for one episode only?Am guessing he will be Davos's rescuer first episode S3.*I could never figure out from the books why , even under Robert, and especially after Robert, why there was not a military garrison at KL? With a competent military commander. It's not in the books that I know of. I don't count the Gold Cloaks since they seem more like the police.Robert could have served that comander purpose, but after him , surely Tywin would have known Joffrey, even if he wasn't an idiot, was way too green. If Jamie had of been there would have fallen to him, but that's out.I know , i know, makes Tryion predicament more dramatic ... still with the odds he could have played the same role. It seemed most of the men Tryion led were Lannister soldiers, hard to see the Hound commanding them...nor Bronn either, they didn't really seem to have some kind of Lannister officer in charge.

769	starki	2012-05-28	W o w @ that first explosion shot of the green flames. Who says TV shows can't do Hollywood style epic battles right ?
Great acting from Tyrion, Cersei and the Hound. I forgot how much Stannis rocks. Why did Cersei want to be killed by Payne...Stannis may be a lot of things but I don't believe he'd hurt her.
And of course the final line was great, along with "let's go kill them!" speech from Tyrion.
770	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	You know, I still can't believe this is real. Not just the fact there's a show or that it's so awesome, but that it's so huge. ASOIAF defies all the set 'laws and principles' for story-writing that have made a lot of books and movies such a dull affair. George proves that you don't have to be mainstream to be good, that you should give the people what they *need* instant of what they want, and for that I can only say hats off to the man.
771	starki	2012-05-28	Quick question: towards at the end when the Lannister men turn over the boat on fire, right before Tyrion curses when more Stannis's men with Loras arrive, what are they shouting ? "Tywinn ! Tywinn!" or something else ?

And even though I'm not a big Stannis fan, I have to admit, Stannis was pretty BA in this episode...
780	Harrad	2012-05-28	Definitely, it's an easter egg, nothing more. It's not much of a plot point anyway but those little nods to the book fans are nice. There's no way that any non-book reader would think of Renly at that point.Good point! I just wonder if they could have done so with different editing. E.g. a closeup of the rider on the white horse focussing on the antlered crown. A reaction shot of a Stannis soldier shouting "i tawt I saw a ghost" or some such TV magic.
781	Lord Rickard Snow	2012-05-28	Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey both deserve an Emmy for this episode.And even though I'm not a big Stannis fan, I have to admit, Stannis was pretty BA in this episode...And when Stannis had To be Pulled away from the Battle.....Total Bad A.
782	FantA´me	2012-05-28	That line jarred me a bit. We know she prays for Joff to NOT return. So that implies she feels the same for Tyrion. Yet she and we know that Tyrion has saved her and taken her side when no one else did. It was clever writing but not entirely appropriate.We know Sansa doesn't have any reason to hate Tyrion but in the books she refuses to trust him even when he's acting kind to her because she has learned never to trust a Lannister again. And whatever else he is, he's still a Lannister, and Lannisters have taken everything from her so I wouldn't call it inappropriate.

783	Tall Tyrion Lannister!	2012-05-28	TBH when I saw it first I didn't know it was Loras in Renly's armor.
784	BlackTalon	2012-05-28	It's a substitute for dragon fire, so ... makes ya wonder ,...?If I remember correctly it is really, really expensive to make and very finicky to transport. I guess no captain would transport it on his ship and it is too sensitive and too easily set off to be transported by cart.
785	Lord Godric	2012-05-28	TBH when I saw it first I didn't know it was Loras in Renly's armor.Did they keep that bit for the show?  If so, I'm impressed.  I never got a good look at Loras' armor before he took off his helm.
786	Lord Balbi	2012-05-28	I loved how Tyrion and Bronn looked at the wildfire-nuke they set off. First, they looked with surprise that it worked, then they looked away because it was too bright, and then they looked in amazement and horror.I loved how everyone kind of close their eyes in the moment of the explosion except for the old alchemist (forgot his name). His eyes are wide open in amusement like "I did this".

788	Lord Godric	2012-05-28	I loved how everyone kind of close their eyes in the moment of the explosion except for the old alchemist (forgot his name). His eyes are wide open in amusement like "I did this".If I remember correctly Joffrey showed a little bit of "I like this" too.  I remember thinking how sadistic he was especially in that scene.  Because contrasted with Tyrion, who visibly was disturbed with the results, Joffrey's expression stood out.
789	Harrad	2012-05-28	We know Sansa doesn't have any reason to hate Tyrion but in the books she refuses to trust him even when he's acting kind to her because she has learned never to trust a Lannister again. And whatever else he is, he's still a Lannister, and Lannisters have taken everything from her so I wouldn't call it inappropriate.If she hasn't learned to distinguish between someone hurting her and someone helping her what exactually is she learning or is she incapable?
790	FantA´me	2012-05-28	If she hasn't learned to distinguish between someone hurting her and someone helping her what exactually is she learning or is she incapable?We know Tyrion's kindness is genuine because we have his POV. Sansa doesn't.He could very well just pretend to be nice to her just like Cersei did. It's only normal to take a minimum amount of risks by trusting almost nobody when you're in the enemy's nest.
791	7V3N	2012-05-28	No one had a problem with it when Robert or Robb did it. Or Victarion. Sansa even comments on it, and the importance of a King fighting alongside his men is stressed many times by Tyrion on the matter of Joffrey to 'prepare' us for this scene, so to speak. It was brilliantly set up really, and I loved the juxtapose between Joffrey's sniveling and Stannis' badassery. Jaime, too, leads from the front. In this case, it was GRRM cleverly showing Stannis' pragmatism in combat. They've just taken a huge hit, their field commander appears to have died, his men were showing doubt... So Stannis decides to lead the charge (also surrounded by his own men, he was in front but it's not like he was way ahead of them), much in the same way Tyrion decided to lead his men to inspire them. It also has something to do with how the battle was adapted: here the attack came directly from the sea, in the books the army was split in two parts by the river they had to cross to attack the wall and they had great difficulties in getting across. It makes more sense for him to lead here where Stannis is able to land himself and a large portion of his army relatively securely and there is not an army still behind him that needs directions.I'm not talking about fighting at the front. I'm talking about being the first. The King would be dead if he was the first, running towards the walls without even a shield. Robert was probably the only one, and that was Robert. He was the guy that didn't care if he lived or died in the battle, because the battle was what he lived for. He was a warrior first.
792	WetHair	2012-05-28	But Alfie Allen wasn't in the episode; isn't that just....wrong somehow?
793	Harrad	2012-05-28	We know Tyrion's kindness is genuine because we have his POV. Sansa doesn't.He could very well just pretend to be nice to her just like Cersei did. It's only normal to take a minimum amount of risks by trusting almost nobody when you're in the enemy's nest.No one on the show or in real life knows what is in another's mind. All we can go on is their acts. What conceivable advantage can it be for Tyrion to show Sansa kindness when she is already trapped at KL? Much easier for him to go along with Joff's sadism. If Sansa has no reasoning ability, just say so, and leave it at that.
794	HellasLEAF	2012-05-28	Hey guys, first time poster here.
I just was so blown away by the last episode.  Unreal television.  
I really don't even know where to begin.
I haven't read the books yet, I sort of got into game of Thrones late and I watched the entire first season about a month ago in a few days and now I am watching them episode to episode.  
However there is no way I am going to wait around for episodes after the season 2 finale so I will be reading the books after episode 10.
Where a bouts does it leave off?  I read that season 3 will start somewhere in the middle of the 3rd book.
795	Harrad	2012-05-28	Where a bouts does it leave off?  I read that season 3 will start somewhere in the middle of the 3rd book.It looks like season 2 ends about where book 2 ends. I did the same as you after season 1. Its a different dynamic watching subsequent seasons having read the books. I think its worth it, but I will never know.
796	FantA´me	2012-05-28	No one on the show or in real life knows what is in another's mind. All we can go on is their acts.

If Sansa has no reasoning ability, just say so, and leave it at that.No I don't think so. I'm not a fan of Sansa but I do think she gained some strength and brains after Games. Conceivable advantage would be her trust, which would be useful should he want to manipulate her for some reason (worked with Cersei in Games). Littlefinger, for example, could do something like that , don't you think? From Sansa's point of view, why should Tyrion be any better than all the manipulative bastards in King's Landing? It's a shame that she doesn't trust him from our point of view, but it's the safer thing to do.
797	Harrad	2012-05-28	Conceivable advantage would be her trust, which would be useful should he want to manipulate her for some reason (worked with Cersei in Games).The lines in the series show that Sansa puts Tyrion in the same boat as Joffrey. That is just wrong. Joff is not trying to manipulate her. He is trying to hurt her. If she believes Tyrion has some alternative motive for helping her, thats ok. He is still helping her. Its time for some shades of grey if she is to become something more than a naive (dumb) kid.
798	Lady Olenna	2012-05-28	Last week I defended D&D and said they would somehow write in Tyrions chain because it was important to his character line. I was wrong. This episode didn't need it. 
Everything was superb. Everything. We get a nice look into the mind of Cersei and just how neurotic she is. We get to see sweet Tommen. Sansa with the doll Ned gave her (that she hated at the time) and the human side of the hound. 
Jack Gleeson continues to make me despise Joffrey and FINALLY I fell in love with Dilane as Stannis. 
I even liked Shae. Although I'm wondering more and more if she's taking the place of Dontos? 
Only mild complaint is that I couldn't understand a word of The National at the end /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
799	Catastrophy	2012-05-28	According to translation we got, Cercei said 4 (I hope they have text and not translate on hearing, since it is official HBO).
I have read books while watching 1st season and like them both. I like complete 2nd season also, but this episode was amazing.
Like someone have said, maybe they should concentrate on less character per episode and not try to show all at once.
800	FantA´me	2012-05-28	The lines in the series show that Sansa puts Tyrion in the same boat as Joffrey. That is just wrong. Joff is not trying to manipulate her. He is trying to hurt her. If she believes Tyrion has some alternative motive for helping her, thats ok. He is still helping her. Its time for some shades of grey if she is to become something more than a naive (dumb) kid.But this is not a naive reaction. The line doesn't mean she hates him as much as she hates Joffrey. But she certainly won't pray for his safe return.You do that realise that ,kind or not, he's still her family's enemy ? Robb's enemy should the North's forces arrive at King's Landing gate. Is it surprising that she would wish for his death then? Tyrion' loyalty goes to the Lannisters, to Joffrey , even if he hates him. Blindly trusting someone who has helped her once, that would be a naive and dumb reaction.

801	Harrad	2012-05-28	Blindly trusting someone who has helped her once, that would be a naive and dumb reaction."Blindly trusting"? Is that the alternative to wishing the same fate on Tyrion as on Joffrey? They are not even fighitng the Starks. They are fighting Stannis who according to Cersei will kill Sansa as he kills the Lannisters. That is not so far-fetched as Stannis considers the Starks traitors. Look what Stannis does to traitors such as his younger brother.

We are already into Jaime/Brienne's story from book 3.
803	Lord Rickard Snow	2012-05-28	Ok who is the guy who walked in with  Sandor Clegane.....His Drinking Buddy? the hound must think him "Harder" than Bronn
Someone Please Speculate or if there's a definite answer...... He's Blond So probably a Lannister...
I was Curious he doesn't seem to be a "Hardened" Solider like Clegane or Bronn and he stares at the empty cup in his hands so well

804	Mooncat	2012-05-28	I think that Sansa's mistrust for anybody Lannister, even Tyrion, helps build up her character and then explains part of her feelings towards Tyrion later in the series. (i.e. the marriage)
805	FantA´me	2012-05-28	"Blindly trusting"? Is that the alternative to wishing the same fate on Tyrion as on Joffrey? They are not even fighitng the Starks.

Look what Stannis does to traitors such as his younger brother.For one thing I'm not going to start an argument over that but I believe Stannis didn't directly order Renly's death and only half realised what really happened.That doesn't excuse him but that's still a far cry from ordering his death. That's what it seemed to be in the books, they changed it a lot in the show. And no, I don't believe Stannis would have killed her. He's ridiculously "fair" but he punishes criminals for what they did. I highly doubt he would have killed Sansa for Robb being a traitor.Besides Tyrion isn't required to survive the battle for it to be won.He's not fighting the Starks right now, but he might eventually. Maybe it doesn't exactly fit book Sansa but  think Sansa's line to Tyrion is the contrary of a display of naivety. And well, Martin wrote it so I suppose it does fit .

If it were that would not make it more sensible. If its not, as I believe, than it was added for TV. As I said before its a nice throw away line, but doesn't correctly reflect what a reasoning Sansa should think. The motives for putting a line in a mouth are not the same as what is sensible in every case.

815	The Second Hand	2012-05-28	I still feel like the horror of the chain -- rising up, etched with fire -- would have been marvelous to see. In any case, it was a nice battle.
816	Ser Kevan Raley	2012-05-28	Some thoughts on episode nine.Wow! That was awesome! They did all one could ask for for a TV show. It wasn't the Battle of Pelennor Fields, but it sure was the TV equivalent. Epic! /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />I cannot help liking Stannis just a little bit. He might have the personality of a lobster, but he's brave and resourceful, and first in the line of battle, even fighting on top of the wall.I really like Davos too, even if he sails into a trap.Sansa, you clever girl tricking Joffrey to be in the vanguard by comparing him to her brother. Too bad he chickened out.I still don't buy the Tyrion/Shae love story. They should have had a different actress, not this former porn star.I liked the Rains of Castamere sing along.Only one gratuitous nude scene with some random wench.I also liked the Bronn/Hound confrontation, and then later when Bronn saved Sandor's life.I didn't care much for Book-Bronn but I like HBO-Bronn.I'm also a big Hound fan, and cheered when he dissed the King. I cannot recall if he did that in the book, but I'm thinking not.For all his bravado about killing, all the fires were too much for him and the Hound deserted. I can sympathize, especially since he obviously doesn't loathes the boy king he's supposed to protect.They did a nice Sandor/Sansa scene, even though I think it should have benefited if they had done some previous scenes between them. He obviously cares for the little bird, and she sees that he won't hurt her. But, like in the book, I cannot understand why she didn't take up his offer of bringing her along.I really dig the rapport between Tyrion and Varys. Their talk was great, even if it wasn't as great as the one in the episode before. They could have those two just talking for an hour and it would be terrific.Tyrion rules! He saves everything both with the wildfire scheme and then leading men into battle after the King and the Hound both disappeared. "Half-man! Half-man! Half-man!"As I suspected the didn't use the chains across the bay. There really was no need.It was clear that Tywin arrived to save the day, but blink and you might have missed Loras, so it wasn't too clear that the Tyrell's had joined the Lannisters. I suppose that will be more evident in the next episode, when Littlefinger will appear.Cersei does have a loving side when it comes to her children. Her and Tommen in the throne room was rather moving.It was the right choice to have all the scenes set in King's Landing and the Blackwater, despite other locations showed in the opening credits.This was easily the best episode this season.
817	FantA´me	2012-05-28	And that implies that the book doesn't make sense for you? Or both make sense? If a thing and its opposite make sense, why bother arguing about what makes sense?Show : Makes sense with a Sansa that won't let herself trust or like a Lannister again.Book: Makes sense with a softer Sansa.They just portray two slightly different evolutions of the character. But I believe it was useful in the show because of how Sansa has (not) been portrayed in previous episodes. And like Mooncat said, might help explain her reaction to the forced marriage to viewers because right now, Tyrion seems like he should be her hero.

That's called having it your own way, both ways, and every which way. I now see the error of MY way.
819	Miryana	2012-05-28	Season 2 has been a bit iffy, but this was an excellent episode.No one on the show or in real life knows what is in another's mind. All we can go on is their acts. What conceivable advantage can it be for Tyrion to show Sansa kindness when she is already trapped at KL? Much easier for him to go along with Joff's sadism. If Sansa has no reasoning ability, just say so, and leave it at that.Like Joffrey with the necklace, he could be luring her in to destroy her. Pointlessly antagonizing people means giving them a reason to strike back if they ever have the chance. Being nice to them can be profitable. It's not easier to go along with Joffrey, it's stupid, and Tyrion's motivations are personal rather than based on kindness towards Sansa - he wants Jaime back and he knows that keeping Sansa relatively safe (that is, not beaten too publicly, he doesn't interfere before that) helps Jaime's odds of surviving. And book Tyrion does end up agreeing to participate in Sansa's abuse when he decides to marry her to get Winterfell, doesn't tell her about that plan until the day it's carried through, chains her to the family that has abused her and a marriage that will keep her in danger of being raped by Joffrey, gropes the frightened 12-year-old, and proceeds to whine about how she wouldn't kneel to save his pride or become his loving fantasy girlfriend, because obviously he's the one suffering in that situation. Sansa is actually being perfectly intelligent by not trusting Tyrion since his goals are the opposite of hers (they involve the defeat of her family and later the claiming of Winterfell through marrying her), and it's not trusting him that allows her to escape her forced marriage, Lannister abuse and a city where she has no one interested in prioritising her safety or even in helping themselves by helping her. She sees what Tyrion fans can't, that he's not on her side.
820	Harrad	2012-05-28	Tyrion's motivations are personal rather than based on kindness towards Sansa - he wants Jaime back and he knows that keeping Sansa relatively safe (that is, not beaten too publicly, he doesn't interfere before that) helps Jaime's odds of surviving.Exactly! And that is why she shouldnt condemn him to death with a pithy quote in the same way she condemns good ole Joff.

827	Harrad	2012-05-28	Sansa was not the same as in the books in the previous episodes.All right! With the understanding that there are two entirely different characters Sansa Book and Sansa HBO, then I willingly agree that the opposite rings true for the two very different creations. Both characters are the eldest daughter of Ned Stark, betrothed to Joffrey Baratheion, held hostage at KL, abused by the King, taunted by the Queen, befriended by Tyrion and on and on and on...but really they are opposites. (Light bulb goes on!)

829	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-28	I really thought that was a great touch with Bronn dropping a little vocabulary on Tyrion and showing his evolution as a character leading into how we all know how it goes down. Common sellsword, that was the old Bronn, brilliant and they pretty much pulled it with one line.

830	Harrad	2012-05-28	You might want to read my posts again if you want to make a point.Maybe you should read your posts again. She should condemn him because he is trying to manipulate her by helping her. Nothing worse than that. Yet she has no idea why he is trying to manipulate her, for example, to trade her for Jaime, a good thing, so she shouldn't have sympathy for him. Air tight.
831	BlueQueen	2012-05-28	I did not interpret Sansa's comment in the way that it seems that most people here do. If anything, I thought it was plain that her words to him were genuine and that she said the rest about Joff to maintain her usual lies in KL. Joff is right there when she says it, but both she and Tyrion understand through the exchange that she will not pray for the King's safety. I think that their expressions in the scene really say it all. Sansa was being honest when she said she would pray for Tyrion. 
	I think that this shows in interesting shift in their relationship that happens much earlier in book 2. They both know that she is lying and they have a sort of understanding. The part I am thinking of is when he first arrives back at court and promises not to savage her, also when he makes the comment about her being as loyal as a deer surrounded by wolves and she corrects him and says lions. She is aware of his genuine kindness, the main problem that she has with him, which is very noticeable during their marriage is that he is and will always be a Lannister.
832	Harrad	2012-05-28	Sansa's character if you didn't understand. She was diminished when compared to the book. And that's partly why the slight change from the book is useful here imo.Slight change: She wants Tyrion dead instead of praying for him to live. Thanks for helping me to understand.
833	Harrad	2012-05-28	I did not interpret Sansa's comment in the way that it seems that most people here do. If anything, I thought it was plain that her words to him were genuine and that she said the rest about Joff to maintain her usual lies in KL. Joff is right there when she says it, but both she and Tyrion understand through the exchange that she will not pray for the King's safety. I think that their expressions in the scene really say it all. Sansa was being honest when she said she would pray for Tyrion.There you go. That makes sense if they were sharing the jibe. That's possible but subtle.
834	lostinwesteros	2012-05-28	Just watched it today - Tyrion rocks!  What a speech to the men! Got me teary.
Loved the expression on Lancel's face throughout.  Great actor, what comic relief!
Really loved Sansa in all her scenes tonight, and she's never been a favorite of mine in the books.  Great acting/writing really showed her character growth, beginning of maturity.  Thought the doll scene perfectly exemplified that.
The wildfire scene has got to be one of the best of all times - no words strong enough to give justice to its power and perfection.  U n b e l i v a b l e!  Even the battle scenes on land, and that's spoken by one who usually can't stand battle scenes!  
The hound was beyond great in all his scenes EXCEPT we were really, really cheated in the San- San scene - my one criticism (but a major one).
So much more.  Will have to come back later to finish.
835	FantA´me	2012-05-28	Yet she has no idea why he is trying to manipulate her, for example, to trade her for Jaime, a good thing, so she shouldn't have sympathy for him. Air tight.Seriously? She should be thinking :" If my dear family's enemy trying to manipulate me , he might have a genuinely good reason for it!I should try to think about them and have some sympathy for the poor lad!" ?That's just ridiculous..

836	TheRiderThatMounts	2012-05-28	Interesting episode, the best one this season.No wonder since it was written by GRRM himself.
I did not agree with seeing Stannis as Achilles, first one off the boats, leading the men into battle without even an iron half helm on. It kinda makes him look like Robert.
When I first heard Bronn sing the Rains of Castamere with the men, I started singing with them. I was laughing like a mad man.
When, at the end of the episode, I heard the song again, it gave me goose bumps.
It was like the entire room was closing in on me, trying to crush me.
A great episode! Full of emotion!
One of the best episodes so far. Taking both seasons into consideration.
837	Harrad	2012-05-28	That's just ridiculous..What's ridiculous is to think that Sansa Book is so opposite to Sansa HBO that they would have the opposite reactions to the same situation. Look at BlueQueen's comment for something that makes sense. [Sense alert]
838	Harrad	2012-05-28	Guru Meditation is an error notice displayed by early versions of the Commodore Amiga computer when they crashed.
I had no idea that Amigas were still hosting websites.
839	Nymeria_Snow	2012-05-28	That. Was. Brilliant.Seriously, if I could get George Martin to write all the episodes I would (although then weâ<U+0080><U+0099>d probably never get Winds of Winter). He left in as many of the best moments that the budget allowed- obviously no chain moment but thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s understandable- and any parts made up felt natural and right.Props to all the actors too, who were all of them on top form. Lena Headley really stood out for me though, although Blackwater in the books really had my all-time favourite Cersei moments. That scene with Tommen was perfection.Also on a side note, the music was brilliant as well. I think with the epicness of the battle, it was really allowed to shine but that was some brilliant work.Season 2 has definitely has itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ups and downs but that may be my favourite episode of both seasons so far.
840	FantA´me	2012-05-28	What's ridiculous is to think that Sansa Book is so opposite to Sansa HBO that they would have the opposite reactions to the same situation.

847	JonF311	2012-05-28	Again, what's with the sympathetic Cersei. She was a friggin B***H in the book, not a sympathetic, fond mother.She's still a b***h, but she's a human b***h, non a one-dimensional harpy. IMO, one of Martin's biggest failures in the books is the botch he made of Cersei. Lena Headey and the writers have rectified that in the series. an if you think she's too nice, would you want her as a mother-in-law?

854	Dirty Steve	2012-05-28	WINNING
855	Juliads	2012-05-28	Its hard to point to the best parts of the last episode, there were so many.
The acting was great, the dialogue, etc.
Is this the last of the Hound?  He was one of my favorite characters.  The scene with Sansa was a bit of a let down.  The series seemed to be hinting at something between them, i'm not sure in what form exactly, but for her to decline his offer to escort her home was disappointing.
I haven't read the books, i don't know what is in store for Sensa, but I assume she would like to get the hell out of Kings Landing and head back home finally, that might have been her only chance to.
856	Raja	2012-05-28	That last scene with Cersei and Tommen was my favorite part of that episode. Such good television.
857	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-28	Awsome!!!But...Why didn't Varys tell his story? What are they waiting for? /frown5.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':frown5:' />  I think he was untrusting of whether Tyrion wanted the maps for the tunnels to flee or for defense of the city.
858	Grimwolfe	2012-05-28	makes me wonder now, assuming Bronn gets knighted, what's his sigil going to be if not a flaming chain? a flaming arrow or bow, or combination of the two mayhaps?

861	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-28	Quick question: towards at the end when the Lannister men turn over the boat on fire, right before Tyrion curses when more Stannis's men with Loras arrive, what are they shouting ? "Tywinn ! Tywinn!" or something else ?Halfman!Halfman!Halfman!

864	Ser Loudmouth	2012-05-28	I loved this episode!
In the Books, I found the battle of the Blackwater to be somewhat anticlimatic, so I wasn't really expecting much from this episode, but in the end I liked it more then in the books, even with the budget restrictions and all that.
The tension, the acting, all was great...
And the amount of foreshadowing was too damn high!
I am a purist and I don't usually apreciate changes or aditions, but I expecially liked the scene between Bronn and Sandor in this episode. And it was written by GRRM himself, so it's "cannonical" in a way. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
One change that I didn't understand howewer: Why didn't Varys tell Tyrion about how he was cut? He did it in the books.
865	Rhaquentis	2012-05-28	One change that I didn't understand howewer: Why didn't Varys tell Tyrion about how he was cut? He did it in the books.To give us a nice little talk between them in the season to come /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> Also, Pod was in the room with him.He was tearing up as well, just remembering about it. And here I was thinking that him being a eunuch was all just a big lie... :/ Oh well! Maybe it was an act and I can still hope /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
866	Lyana	2012-05-28	It's not television, it's HBO!
No, let me paraphrase: "It's not a TV show, it's Game of Thrones!"
Where should I start... that was an amazing episode.
All the tension that has been piling up, showing... no, letting us feel the fear and the misery.
And then... THE explosion. That belongs in the cinema, on the big screen.
Every freakin' scene was awesome - Tyrion, Sansa, Cersei, Bronn, The Hound, Davos, Varys, Joffrey and Stannis... oh, Stannis. His face, his determination, him swinging his sword. I was like: He's awesome!!! And at the end:"Stand and fight! Stand and fight damn you!", I felt like I was going to cry.
I loved the contrast between the two kings. The one is still a boy, escaping the battle while his men still need him and the other is an experienced military leader, whose men escape, when he needs them.
The little hints of Varys were also great:
- the story about how he has been cut - I see that could be of importance.
- his line about the bells and the wedding - nice foreshadowing there.
I loved how Sansa tried to trick Joffrey into fighting in the front lines.
But the nicest touch for me was how the explosion showed everyone's true face. While Joffrey and the pyromancer were facinated and Bronn didn't show much emotions, Tyrion and the Hound had those "What have we done"-looks and it was just great.
And just when I thought the final scene couldn't be more perfect, I hear the "Rains of Castamere" and that has blown my mind!
And the writing ... what can I say. Not just that it was GRRM himself, but that episode had amazing dialogs. The great lines were so many. I can't help it and will post the highlights that come on the top of my head:
 â<U+0080><U+009C>-Poor nose.
  -Donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t feel sorry for him. He will be half way up your ass before the night is through.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re just like me, only smallerâ<U+0080><U+009D> 
â<U+0080><U+009C>-Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not escaping. As strange as it sounds Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m the captain of the ship and if the ship goes down I go down with it.
 -That is good to hear. Though Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m sure many captains say the same while their ship is a float."
â<U+0080><U+009C>-Do you know how to use that?
 -Chopped wood onceâ<U+0080>¦ No, I watched my brother chopping wood.
 -I saw you kill a man with a shield. Youâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll be unstoppable with an axe.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>-I will pray for your safe return, milord.
 -Will you?
 -Just as I pray for the kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>-If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, heâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll do it without a second thought.
 -That would make me the Quarterman. Just doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have the same ring to it.â<U+0080><U+009D> 
â<U+0080><U+009C>-We are too far from the gates. Their fire, their archersâ<U+0080>¦ hundreds will die.
 -Thousands.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>-Your father doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t believe in the Gods?
 -He believes in them. He just doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t like them very much.â<U+0080><U+009D>
â<U+0080><U+009C>If any man dies with a clean sword, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll rape his fucking corpse.â<U+0080><U+009D>

867	Baitac	2012-05-28	Hey guys, first time poster here.I just was so blown away by the last episode.  Unreal television.  I really don't even know where to begin.I haven't read the books yet, I sort of got into game of Thrones late and I watched the entire first season about a month ago in a few days and now I am watching them episode to episode.  However there is no way I am going to wait around for episodes after the season 2 finale so I will be reading the books after episode 10.Where a bouts does it leave off?  I read that season 3 will start somewhere in the middle of the 3rd book.Welcome, Hellas! You picked a great topic for your first post. Hope you keep posting. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
868	WillWork4NinjaPowers	2012-05-28	Showing Stannis on the front lines adds to the contrast between Joff that had already been set up by Sansa, when she asks Joff if he will lead the van, like her brother does.  It's a stab at Joff.  Then we see Stannis on the front lines and Joff running off to hide.  It may not be in the exact character of Stannis, but it really highlights Joff's character.
869	StarkWard	2012-05-28	He gave her his cloak earlier in the season and he hasn't worn it since that I have noticed.Come to think of it, yeah. He did give it to her when she was being beaten in the throne room.
870	Marjie Eilie Myatt	2012-05-28	Overall, awesome, but there are nitpicks.  Even If GRRM did write it.  I would think time constraints reduced the SanSan scene.  But so many SanSan scenes have been reduced that I wonder if he has had a change of heart over what he originally wrote.Time constraints?  I could have used less Cersei monologue.  I thought she would never shut up.  They'll probably submit that episode for her Emmy.  blecch.
871	legba11	2012-05-28	Can someone tell me what the hell the Bronn/The Hound scene amounted to? Pretty dull and pointless if you ask me. Yeah, they're both interesting characters, but their meeting just fell flat.The whole opening sequence was how different people prepare for battle.  The theme of the episode was what Bronn has been telling Tyrion for weeks.  Plans and tactics and gimmicks are nice, but battles are won by men who are willing to fight and die.  Period.So what was Bronn doing?  Raising morale.
872	StarkWard	2012-05-28	Everyone's noting the possible foreshadowing by GRRM with Cersei's repeated mention of Sansa being the future queen. Also note that she always said it as "IF you will be queen". Of course, the realization is not as exciting if you've read the books already.
873	lostinwesteros	2012-05-28	@aquariumdrinker and @starkward above:
Excellent!  As big a fan as I am of the SanSan motif, I never once noticed the cloak thing.  I was so disappointed that the heart of their scene was just cut out.
@ marjie eilie myatt:
I'm with you, basically as I said above.  I canNOT believe they let Cercei have all that (did I use pointless in reference to the time? I meant to!) time and stole the SanSan moment away!
Grumble, grumble, grumble . . . Then, moving on from that, the rest of the episode, and I mean all the rest, was indescribably and earthshakingly a m a z i n g.
874	Bastard of Boston	2012-05-28	I wonder if the little boy playing Tommen has parents. I'd like to adopt him. And, I don't like kids. But, jeez.
875	lostinwesteros	2012-05-28	PS - can't wait to get back home to my laptop where I can access the emotion faces . . . Coulda used a bunch of those over the last couple of days!
876	lostinwesteros	2012-05-28	Can't get the "quote" function to work on my daughter's iPad, either, but @ Bastard of Bolton above, I was thinking the same thing.  And the one truly great Cercei scene in the episode (maybe even the series) is sitting beside Tommen on the Iron Throne telling him the story of the little lion cub.  Just saying.
877	MuchandMore	2012-05-28	I think this episode pissed me off more than any other so far.  If HBO weren't the cheap a$$es that they are, EVERY episode could be as good as this one.  It......was.....PERFECT! 
I really hope that going forward, they add more of the action.  It is SO much more enjoyable than them trying to distract me with topless woman.
878	Grunkins	2012-05-28	Best show of the season.  Bronn in battle (first saving the Hound, then killing dudes) was badass.  Joffrey is a bitch, so all is well.  I liked Cersei and Tommen in the throne room, and Tywin's entrance.  Stannnis didn't get very far did he?  He took that one section of the rampart and pretty much stayed there.  Anyone think Shae may not betray Tyrion?
879	RoamingRonin	2012-05-28	Cersei with Tommen on the Iron Throne was really heartbreaking. It was the best scene of the episode and probably the season. Lena Headey has always been by favorite actor on the show. It was almost as sad as when she confronted Tyrion about the death of their mother. She truly deserves some sort of recognition, an Emmy nomination at least, for her work this season. I can't wait to find a transcript for the scene. The episode isn't up on HBO On Demand yet.
880	Raksha the Demon	2012-05-28	In my opinion, this was the best episode of the season - even without Theon, whose arc has been outstanding this year.I loved the battle scenes and the moments before and in between.  The bit between Tyrion, Lancel, the (silent) Hound and Joffrey where the conversation was going round and round without getting anywhere.  The old pyromancer (yay, Roy Dotrice!)'s glee at finally being able to use the Wildfire again.  Tyrion's simultaneous awe and horror at the results of that Wildfire usage.  The gorgeous shot of Bronn setting it off with bow and arrow.  Sansa's sweet but catty 'prayers' for Joffrey and Tyrion; especially her reminding Joffrey (who is trying but failing to humiliate her again) how her 'pretender' brother always leads from the front.  Ilyn Payne's stare - forget the Hound, this guy is scary!  Cersei getting more and more drunk; and her touching and horrifying scene at the end with Tommen on the Iron Throne about to kill her child before the expected enemies can crash through and put him to the sword.  And Berserker Stannis - I don't remember if it was true to the book, but his insistence in leading from the front reminded me how single-minded Stannis can be; I loved it when his men had to drag him kicking and screaming from the battle when it was lost.   And the arrival of Tywin and the Lannister/Tyrell cavalry.  No one, I am now convinced, rides a white horse like Charles Dance as Tywin.  Amazing!  Tyrion emulating an angry hobbit and striking his foe in the lower leg, not to mention Tyrion the whole darned time.  I'm a book purist, but I don't mind at all if they have him keep his nose; Peter Dinklage is too good-looking to mutilate onscreen.I'll save my nitpicks for the appropriate thread; but I was very pleased with the episode, it was tense, action-packed and yet held some great character moments.  And thank the Seven there were no interruptions by Daenerys whining about her dragons.  (I do hope we see all three of them next week, though)

What a great line
884	Raksha the Demon	2012-05-29	Show : Makes sense with a Sansa that won't let herself trust or like a Lannister again.Book: Makes sense with a softer Sansa.They just portray two slightly different evolutions of the character. But I believe it was useful in the show because of how Sansa has (not) been portrayed in previous episodes. And like Mooncat said, might help explain her reaction to the forced marriage to viewers because right now, Tyrion seems like he should be her hero.The TV characterization of Sansa has not run quite as close to the book as I would like.  But it is in ACOK that after Tyrion saves Sansa from Joffrey's beating/stripping ordeal and brings her back to his tower and has her washed and medically attended, that Sansa herself, in her thoughts, wants to trust Tyrion, thinking that he seems kind; but reminds herself that Cersei seemed kind to her too.  (I don't have the book in front of me now)  She cannot bring herself to trust him or to forget that Tyrion is a Lannister.  Despite his having shown her some decency and even kindness, he is a member of the family that killed her father after promising to be merciful; the family that is holding her captive.  I didn't blame Sansa one bit for not trusting Tyrion, or any Lannister.  The show has also had to make Sansa more emotionally immature than she was in the books.  Her foolish behavior and somewhat superficial, sheltered outlook on life in the first season; is more understandable in an 11-year-old child than it is in a 13-year-old; and in the book, she was 12 during the Battle of the Blackwater; TV-Sansa is supposed to be 14 but looks 18 (it doesn't help that the young actress is a tall, beautiful girl who is physically maturing quickly).  Sansa was an isolated (no Shae to trust, just the drunken Ser Dontos) abused 12-year-old in the book; and the best defense she could muster was not to trust any Lannister again, even one who appeared to be kind; and it's a pretty good strategy.  TV-Sansa's distrust of Tyrion even after he saved her from Joffrey was well-portrayed by Sophie Turner, there is, initially, fear/wariness in her eyes and face when he approaches her and extends his hand.  Unfortunately, by the time they get around to marrying TV-Sansa to TV-Tyrion, the pathos and injustice of marrying a child (flowering or no flowering, she's not yet 13, young even by Westerosi standards; and book-Tyrion said on their wedding night that he desired her even though she is still a child) will be lost, because Sophie Turner is a gorgeous teenager who will be 17 or so in real life and not look remotely childish.
885	Raksha the Demon	2012-05-29	That line jarred me a bit. We know she prays for Joff to NOT return. So that implies she feels the same for Tyrion. Yet she and we know that Tyrion has saved her and taken her side when no one else did. It was clever writing but not entirely appropriate.In the book, if I remember right, Sansa does pray for Tyrion and many others, in a private but heartfelt prayer.  As for TV-Sansa, she's a bit different from the original character; maybe she believed that if Tyrion and Joffrey were both dead, she might have a better chance of being sent home.
886	Ghost714	2012-05-29	Does anybody think Joffrey or Cersei ordered Sandor to take out Bronn, but he desided not to after actually seeing Bronn was what he claimed to be, a "hard man", like Sandor himself?
Or was Sandor just testing Bronn for himself, trying to see what kind of man he would be fighting with soon? 
Or was Sandor just wanting to kill someone?
I could see it being the first option, there would be a lot of motive for wanting to take Bronn out of the picture in the show. He is in charge of the City Watch, and he actually spends time with the men, earning their loyalty. Also, Bronn isn't a fraud, he is everything he claims to be. So even if Cersei put someone else "officially" in charge, the men would probably still listen to Bronn, and think of him as their Commander(similar to Skahaz mo Kandaq with the Brazen Beasts in ADwD, even when "demoted", he was still in charge of his men). So I can see why Cersei would see the need to have Bronn killed, and not just demoted. I would like it if that was the case, because it would be interesting knowing Sandor didn't kill him out of some weird twisted respect for a fellow "real killer". 
I loved how Bronn got up, and didn't back down from Sandor, while keeping his hand on his knife, that scene was so badass. Bronn's knife at his lower back is so cool, it just really fits the character, and I thought it was a really great touch having Bronn shoot the guy on fire running at Sandor, that was one of those truly great moments in television, and this episode was full of moments like that.
887	J_Crews	2012-05-29	Bronn's knife at his lower back is so cool, it just really fits the character, I'm with you.  I wish my rinky-dink town had a custom knife maker.  I would SO have one of those made.  /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
888	Arawni	2012-05-29	Tactically, no Stannis shouldn't have charged up the ladder.  You hang back and engage when you think the turning point is come.  Just how Tywin does things.  Still badass, though. Not badass, just stupid. Maybe it's just me but I don't see that acting stupid and irresponsibly endangering your army and attack by charging mindlessly to the most dangerous spot on a battlefield. In a way I do understand why they wanted to place Stannis in the front line as they made some characters fight without helmets (IRL would NEVER happen but in this case characters must be recognizeble to audience) but still I couldn't get that "he's the badass!!11" feeling from it.Well, it didn't ruin the apisode for me, though, not by a close. Episode was epic and I loved it from beginning to the end and most praising about characters, acting and such has already been made so I won't repeate everything. Just awesome episode and that's it.
889	Vandalism	2012-05-29	Wonderful episode, really wonderful. I absolutely loved the genuine epic factor in it. Sandor's exchange with Bronn was bone chilling; I always love it when GRRM's characters interact with each other.
Stannis Motherfucking Baratheon was bad-ass as usual. They gave him fighting scenes which was brilliant, because the guy's a soldier and a good one at that. I loved his swordfighting scenes, Sandor and Bronn's combat skills and in general everything about the fighting.
The end was amazing, despite me being a Stannis fan. It was fast and abrupt, just like in the books. Loras taking off his helm and Tywin striding into the hall, boss as ever.
Then the Rains of Castamere =D
890	BlackTalon	2012-05-29	I'm with you.  I wish my rinky-dink town had a custom knife maker.  I would SO have one of those made.  /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />that knife is a typical Gurkha Kukri ( a bit strange, but apparently the filmmakers thought it would be sufficiently exotic to be unknown to most of the audience and not be associated with something from "this" world). One gets a good look at it when Bronn and Tyrion are surrounded by the mountain clans on their way back from the eyrie.If you are really serious about wanting one, you ought to check out www.himalayan-imports.com , they offer genuine handforged Nepalese kukris. Not cheap, but these knifes are the real thing, not some Chinese ebay crap.Long time knife and blade aficionado here :-)

891	nara	2012-05-29	Only question is, should Joffrey have been with Cersei and Tommen in that scene? It's great with Cersei and her baby, but would she have allowed Joffrey to be captured?  I doubt it.
Edited because I realized part of my comment was incorrect.

892	RoamingRonin	2012-05-29	On rewatch, I noticed that when Cersei says to Tommen "you will be strong and fierce, just like your father" they cut to Tyrion watching his father, Tywin, on his white destrier, cutting down soldiers left and right.  LOVE it.  Only question is, should Joffrey have been with Cersei and Tommen in that scene? It's great with Cersei and her baby, but would she have allowed Joffrey to be captured?  I doubt it.I assumed Cersei took only Tommen because she didn't know where Joffrey was. Lancel refused to tell her and it wouldn't be safe/smart for her to wander around the castle looking for him.
893	BlackTalon	2012-05-29	"my nose will be half way up your ass by the time the night is done"What a great linespeak for yourself ... I think I would have preferred not to be told anything about BronnÂ´s favourite practices in bed o_O
894	never trust a bard	2012-05-29	WOW.  Best episode yet.  Amazing.  It was nice to get a whole epi on one topic.  Amazing battle but still so many great moments for characters.Best line: Any man dies with a clean sword, I will rape his fucking corpse! - SandorMost chilling moment: Throne room with Tommen.  /eek.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':eek:' />Best acting:  Tie between Cersei and Sansa, well and Sandor, Joeffrey too ... ok, and a ton others.Loved all the Sandor stuff.  The wildfire was breathtaking.  I'm so amazed that we got so much character in this great battle episode.  We saw great character moments from Cersei (evil and vulnerable), Jeoffrey (weak and stupid), Sansa (starting to develop into her own), Sandor (seeing what a wrecked person he is), Tyrion (one of the few people who's got a great head on his shoulders).  I could go on and on.  So many great moments.  Pod, Renly's armor, OMG.  I'll just stop.

897	BigThroner	2012-05-29	Good EP>		 Strange they did not jump between storylines. Sad at first but
.looking forward to my favs next week! This series is eating a huge chunk of my
time i have watched every episode more than 3x's and still lern something here
and there. Books are a definite after this series , trust me. /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />
898	Conchobar	2012-05-29	In the book, when Tywin came, I imagined that shit all happened across the river. So Stannis and most of his army were across the river and they needed to cross it to get to the walls, but how are we supposed to imagine this large "Lannister/ Tyrell" force came to the other side of the river?
899	legba11	2012-05-29	On rewatch, I noticed that when Cersei says to Tommen "you will be strong and fierce, just like your father" they cut to Tyrion watching his father, Tywin, on his white destrier, cutting down soldiers left and right.  LOVE it.  Only question is, should Joffrey have been with Cersei and Tommen in that scene? It's great with Cersei and her baby, but would she have allowed Joffrey to be captured?  I doubt it.Do you think Joffery would have sat there and listened to his mom tell stories and then drink the poison?  I don't and I doubt Cersei did either.  He didn't come back to the keep because she beckoned, he came because he was afraid and she gave him the excuse.  To be honest, (and I'm glad this didn't happen) I'm surprised he didn't go find Sansa and go out with a bang, thinking he was a dead king anyway.
900	sdallis	2012-05-29	I want to write a long and elegant post about how amazing this episode was, but I can't because I shit myself and I have to go clean up...
901	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-29	Joffrey is too cowardly to even face Sansa without his Kingsguard; she would likely kick his ass like Arya before her if he tried anything funny  ^^@ Celli: I actually had to use the King's Landing map in order to make sense of both fights. In the books they had to cross a river, in the show it seems to me like Maegor's hold and the Mudgate were facing the sea rather than the river, and Stannis' army wasn't divided into a land and naval force but just attacking straight from the sea as one large naval force. With King's Landing facing the sea, there appeared to simply be no river for them to cross... which would explain it.
902	WillH	2012-05-29	Rewatched the episode and got so hype about it had to do a Stannis painting.  It's still really rough but wanted to share its progress and see what ya'll think.  Tried to give Lightbringer some glow to it.http://wharris.files...isthemannis.jpg

903	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-29	Nicely done! I have a new background!
904	Kantor	2012-05-29	I know Joffrey is a little beast, but I couldn't help feeling a little sorry for him after seeing how terrified he was when Stannis' army started to land.
For all of his psychopathy, he is still a child, and he doesn't know anything about the reality of war.
905	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-29	Well, that much is true. Much of my sympathy for him being only a kid is lost however because of his repeated claims he is going to kill Stannis and Robb personally - in the books he even wants to face Robb in a duel. Among the levies raised at Lannisport were probably people around his age who fought and died to defend his crimes as well. I'm not saying 'child soldiers' are a good thing, yet it seems like a 'common' thing in Westerosi warfare especially when the need for men is high. Squires commonly partake in battle at their Ser's side as well as aspiring lords. Think back on Cley Cerwyn (14 years old) who lead his House against Theon-occupied Winterfell out of sheer necessity and got killed in the battle against the Boltons, for example. Or Podrick who is even younger and already in the thick of it.

906	Ser Robert	2012-05-29	The Wildfire explosion was brilliant-I do think Tyrions role in the defence was underplayed though without the chain and wildmen.
Im glad they left out Renlys ghost-confused me for ages and missed the fact that Jamie figured out it was Loras brother (?) in AFFC on my first read through.

He's playing such a despicable human being, but when the time calls for it he can really pull off the childlike insecurity and fearfulness of Joff that almost tricks us into feeling bad for him. Its very subtle and that's one of the reasons why Jack Gleeson is such a damn good actor. Of course, two or three minutes later you remember this is JOFF and you are like "just die already" /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />Just wanted to come back to express my love for this episode again.

908	BigWilleyStyle	2012-05-29	I think the complaint is that a king would not lead the charge (even Robb is surrounded by his own men). I say in my post that my complaints are all moot because it is all coming from the source, but it still seemed out of place. I think it was a classic "give them a show" scene. Why would we want to see some bannerman storming the shores and climbing the walls?I had the same initial reaction as you. In the books we are told over and over again that Robert (not Stannis) would have been the one to lead the charge over the wall, kill most of his enemies and then make friends with those still left alive).  So I was initially surprised they went that way with his character.  However, I changed my mind for two reasons   a) We don't really get a Stannis POV so who's to say how he thinks on the inside. and /cool.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='B)' /> The non book reader reaction to Stannis makes me thing this is a good look for him.  All they've heard from Stannis up to this point is whining about the throne should be his and some underhanded sorcery used to accomplish his victories thus far. Him leading the charge shows how much he himself is willing to do to get his throne back. It also is supported by Davos' emphasis on him attempting to do it without the Melisandre's aide which I felt was understated in the book.
909	Gran de Lys	2012-05-29	I have to agree, WillH--your painting really captures the tone and mood.
Thinking about the Sansa/Hound scene, and after a rewatch, I'm actually glad they left out the song. Firstly, in a very battley episode, there were long stretches of talk: Cersei and Sansa, Cersei and Tommen, Tyrion and Varys, Tyrion and Bronn, Sansa and Shae, opening scene with Tyrion and Shae. I think that late in the battle when things were getting really dire, it would have slowed things down. But more importantly, while it worked in the drawn-out pace of the book, it would not have translated well to the compressed hour and the visual aspect of TV. I mean, hasn't poor Sansa been bullied enough by the Lannister monsters? "Kiss my sword," "You're gonna get raped," "The man who chopped off your father's head is going to chop off yours," "Sing for me." Cripes, the poor little creature's mind would have cracked in two. At that point, I would have run into the throne room and licked the poison off the floor to get away from their constant humiliating demands.
Oh, p.s., halfway through the episode, my viewing companion sneered, "So it's 'Saving Private Tyrion'." Remind me not to watch with smallfolk.

913	Axon	2012-05-29	Tywin coming into the throne room and announcing victory was legendary.
Stannis was particularly impressive in this episode (though it is clearly stated that neither he or Tywin lead from the front during battles in the books).   But that's why I love these GRRM penned episodes; it allows him to update the occurrences of the novels.  Stannis getting right in the thick of things, at least to me, seems more like what I would expect from him.

The leader of the Tyrell/Lannister vanguard on the white horse is Loras (instead of Garlan) in Renly's armor. Tyrion sees him before losing consciousness, which gives it a nice surreal touch imho. And later we see Loras take off the antler helmet and a thousand LOREAL Westeros macros are born.  /laugh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' />

917	Kaitscralt	2012-05-29	Without them showing Sansa meeting with Dontos in the godswood, and him "planning to take her home", it was a little weird that she didn't go with Sandor. Especially because he said he would keep her safe and take her home to Winterfell. I mean right after that, Sansa said you won't hurt me, as a statement, so of she didn't think Sandor would hurt her, then why not go with him?She didn't go with him because she was convinced the city had been sacked, and Shae told her that Stannis wouldn't hurt her. The Hound is scary and drunk and talks to her about his love of killing in an earlier episode.
918	teemo	2012-05-29	I loved this episode, and it was finally an episode my boyfriend liked, who had been hating it all season (sort of like me).  Well, he has never really liked it so much since Ned and Robert died.  He felt like they were the only "manly guys" in the show (people who actually fight in battle), and this episode we saw a lot of Bronn and The Hound and he became interested in their story (and Stannis until I told him that in the books he didn't actually fight - maybe I should have left that out since Stannis is one of my favorite characters)...wondering out loud where Sandor goes, actually LAUGHING at dialogue for I think the first time all season.  I know it was a war so it may be a little easier to get into it, but from an Unsullied, he noticed the different writing, the better dialogue, a shift of focus on more interesting characters...I was so happy!  And this is only the second time all season that I have done re-watches of an episode.  In the first season, I would re-watch every episode like 4 times...

I don't think he was first one on the walls, but it's much smaller scaled in the books and we don't have any named characters left on his side so I think it's justified.

What is her name?Ros has gotten as much (if not more) screen time as some main characters (up until the whore beating), and she is completely made up. She represents the changes made in the translation from book to show.Not only that, she is featured. The other whores aren't featured in scenes, and I don't think they are even given names.

928	timstanton	2012-05-29	i know its a little off topic by now, but people were talking earlier about when RW will be. if i had to guess, i would say that arya starts out with the brotherhood early next season, gets taken by the hound, and we see them at the RW episode 9. it seems that they like to put the major pieces at ep. 9, then the final scene of the season is zombie cat. (with the brotherhood, only reason i mentioned them at all)

She represents the changes made in the translation from book to show.Aha! Now I get it: Ros's nature as a prostitute is a symbolic acknowledgement that GRRM is prostituting himself by allowing his work to be adapted and changed! /devil.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':devil:' />Just kidding, of course... /laugh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' />
930	Lpearce7	2012-05-29	I've watched it thrice since Sunday, I just can't get over how perfect it was. I thought Lost was the best TV show I'd ever see, but this was better, no question. At least 4-5 actors should receive awards or at least nominations:
Cersei, The Hound(Sandor) & Bronn, Tyrion, Sansa was also great. And Shae was really good. Don't even get me started on how perfect the actors playing Stannis was. And Pod saving Tyrions life. Also Varys' promise to divulge the story of how he was "cut"
Simply put, the best TV I've ever seen, and I watch A LOT of TV!
931	Kvothe the Arcane	2012-05-29	As perfect an episode that could ever have been done. 
Special shout out needs to go to Stephen Dillane, he really sold his performance of Stannis to me this episode, truly brilliant. I'm also glad they have not gone for the nose-less Tyrion also, whilst the brutality of the injury worked excellently in the books on TV it would just hinder Peter Dinklage's fine acting with prosthetics on his face all the time. 
Here's looking forward to next week's finale, they have a lot to fit in!
932	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-29	Completely right dude, Tyrion's chopped off nose irritated me to no end even in the books - it's gross, you can't get around it since Tyrion is always scratching it and the injury served no real purpose. A cool battle scar is far more badass / overall better.okay so there are 3 whores in kings landing.Don't forget the one played by Emily Diamond... She's far hotter than all the others combined ^__^ The one from this episode kinda grosses me out... every time I see her I think of that scene with Littlefinger and the angry customer receiving a cum-kiss and my stomach just turns.

I think that scene really showed the truth about old time brothels, and how gross the must have been, and that was a high class whore house to.

936	legba11	2012-05-29	Joffrey is too cowardly to even face Sansa without his Kingsguard; she would likely kick his ass like Arya before her if he tried anything funny  ^^I take it back, I wish they had put in that scene then...

Not cheap, but these knifes are the real thing, not some Chinese ebay crap.Long time knife and blade aficionado here :-)Those are beautiful, but you're right about them not being cheap.  There was a nice 18-incher for only $150, though... not too bad.  Thanks.  I really like where Bronn wears it too.

940	Marjie Eilie Myatt	2012-05-29	She's not the one in Pycelle's chamber and the one Ros beat. That was the noob from episode 3 that Ros gave orientation too. She was the one Ros trained with in season 1 and the one sent to replace Ros after Ros' breakdown after the bastard massacre.Why hire another actress when they can just use one they already have?Ros is the whore in Pycelle's chamber in Season 1 Episode 10.  I just watched that episode tonight by coincidence.Somebody's got to do the requisite HBO sex scenes, I suppose.
941	Lady of Long Lake	2012-05-29	The sword, the face, the eyes, the voice, the fury, the fury, THE FURY!!!  Stannis owned.  Absolutely from start to â<U+0080><U+009C>Voltron-combination-to-defeat-himâ<U+0080><U+009D> ending,Agree!! That was an amazing performance. He looked possessed, fearless and deranged and I LOVED EVERY MINUTE of it. That was how Robert was described as a fighter and this was the first time Isaw that Baratheon warrior blood in Stannis. It was a wonderful surprise from the tv series:)Tywin scares me with his powerful swagger but his game face seems like a pose- something he does to look like a tough military commander. Stannis looked raw and out of control and real. He would scare the bejesus out of me if he came at me with that violent look on his face. God he looked fierce.
942	Lady of Long Lake	2012-05-29	Rewatched the episode and got so hype about it had to do a Stannis painting.  It's still really rough but wanted to share its progress and see what ya'll think.

God he looked fierce.I know it looked cool, having Stannis be that badass, but I hate what the are implying for the character. You said it yourself, Stannis looked "possessed" and "deranged". The show is making it out to seem like Stannis was unstoppable, but not because he is a naturally skilled swordsman or anything. They are making him seem unstoppable, "because he sold his soul to the devil", and that's why he couldn't be killed. This is backed up by the show having Varys say, "the dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his army's and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse." I really hate them doing this to Stannis's character, he is not evil, and he did not sell his soul to a "demon"(Melisandre), to win the Iron Throne. Melisandre is also not evil, we learn this as the story goes on. I don't know how the show is going to come back from this, that's a major "butterfly effect" IMO, and I am afraid the show will continue to make these two characters black, instead of grey. Even when the show gets to ADwD, I am afraid they will still make these two characters "evil", and that's bullshit IMO, the story is much better with grey characters. I personally believe that, even though Stannis and Melisandre are "grey" characters, overal I would still consider them as "good guys". Just like how Arya has killed in cold blood, but she is still in the catagory of "good", when looking at the big picture.When we first meet Stannis and Melisandre, most of us though they were "bad", but as the story progressed, we learn that's not the case. So I am worried that, even if the show wants to start showing these two characters as not being evil down the road, like in the books, they won't be able to, because they have made them to unredeemable, and to unlikeable. If that makes sense.
945	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-30	Well it depends on people's memory really. If they remember Varys' scene with Illyrio about killing Ned, they won't give much weight to his words. Melisandre wasn't even included in the attack, so his argument makes little sense and even the most casual of viewers will see Stannis was trying to take KL fair and square rather than relying on magic. I even saw someone remark 'why isn't he helped by scary gas demon?!' lol. Like in the books, almost all the information we get about Stannis is second-hand information given to us by his enemies. People may be able to see past that in time - I remember a lot of people saying Stannis grew on them gradually. When Tywin and Cersei will inevitably lose some respect (they have been toned down up till now, but Qyburn and the framing of Tyrion just has to happen) that'll only work to his advantage. If not, more people are sure to start rooting for him when he appears at the Wall and later even more when he's the only main guy left opposing the instigators of the Red Wedding and Ramsay the Horrible.

I'm hoping they don't cut Edric Storm and Stannis fighting with himself (morality -vs- ambition) over whether or not to let Mel burn him.  Seeing that struggle, with Davos essentially saving Stannis' soul and helping him to find the honorable path, could make for great TV and a lot of dramatic tension for season 3.

948	Ghost714	2012-05-30	Yes, but since we know how Varys was cut, we know he has good reason for a negative bias against magic and magic practitioners.The people who have actually read the books know that, not the people who only watch the show. It would not have been so bad, had Varys told the story, but he didn't, and now all the non book readers most likely think Stannis is evil. And that's my point, they are doing so many things to make Stannis look evil, it wasn't just this episode. This episode was just when they made Stannis look really evil. Most book readers start off not liking Stannis, and thinking he would make a bad King,  but as the story goes on, many of us changed our minds and we started to like Stannis, and thinking he would be a good King. I don't see that happening at all for the people who only watch the show. D B Weiss has actually said Stannis would make a horrible King, and it's very obvious his personal opinion of Stannis is reflecting in how the character is written. I don't agree with that at all, they should let the viewer deside for themselves on how the feel about Stannis. The show writers own personal opinion should not reflect in the character when doing an adaptation. They need to stop this black and white bullshit, and make the story with grey characters, like they are in the books. That's probably the biggest thing that sets aSoIaF apart from most fantasy, it's characters are not black and white, even the "good guys" do some fucked up stuff. That's one of the reasons why people like the books so much, and the show is screwing that up.

So even if they do give him a face turn, I don't see that many people starting to like him, like with the books. Right now they are going so heavy handed with the black and white characters, its going to be an unbelievable transition when these characters start doing the opposite. I don't see many show watchers changing their opinions of Stannis in particular.
950	Targaryen Kaiser	2012-05-30	I don't think they tried to make Stannis a bad guy. On the contrary,in his interactions with Davos, he seemed to be a stern but just person. All the non-book followers I have met, they were rooting for Stannis in the battle of Blackwater. XD
951	Red Raven	2012-05-30	Stannis was a badass but the best scene of the night for me was Bronn pulling the bow, arching waaaaay back and shooting the arrow into the night.  It was the coolest shot by bow I've ever seen save for the archer during the Barcelona olympics opening ceremonies.  Thrilling!
952	legba11	2012-05-30	Gotta disagree on Stannis being too heelish this episode (his direct knowledge of killing his brother certainly did that earlier, though).  Stannis looks like a true leader this episode.  Look at the other rulers we've seen:
Robert: gets drunk and goes hunting when it's time to do something difficult
Joffery: lol
Ned: Unable to put his honor aside to do whats best, this whole mess is his fault (as much as we love him, Ned would be a horrible king)
Dany: she planned on bringing a barbarian horde to rape and pillage to retake her throne and now all she talks about is burning all her enemies (I hope they fix this next season)
Renly: likable but like Robert, unable to do the tough parts of ruling 
In this episode, Stannis is shown as the man who will do what it takes to be king.  He (last ep) selected the most likable character currently on the show (Davos,) as his hand, and now, when the things get rough, he is the first man off the boats and the first man up the ladder onto the battlements.  There was no indication of anything mystical about him (other than Varys, who nobody believes).  They went out of their way (weeks ago) to make sure we knew he is doing nothing mystical this time.  To quote my non-book fiance, she he was on the front of the boat, "Now that's a king!"  He was painted as the anti-Joffery this episode, you could not do more to make him more of a face (this episode)
953	Harrad	2012-05-30	Robert: gets drunk and goes hunting when it's time to do something difficultHow quickly they forget. Stannis owes any claim he has to be King to Robert for actually deposing a real King and his regime, the Targaryans. Robert was a better warrior than Stannis and a better general, for example,  by inspiring loyalty in great allies like Ned Stark. Stannis can't even win a battle against Tyrion Lannister (who held him off until the cavalry came), and the only reason he could challenge at KL is because he used the Sorceress to murder his younger brother.Stannis improves in subsequent books with his (somewhat surprising) foray north of the wall and his campaign south of the wall. However he would make a terrible King and I don't suspect GRRM will give him the chance to be one.

Did you miss the part of Tyrion saying "fuck me", as like a thousand guys came charging at his small band of troops? Had Tywin and Loras been three minutes later, all of Tyrion's men would have been slaughtered, including Tyrion himself. Same goes for in the book. Stannis would not make a horrible King, it's because he used Melisandre to kill his brother that makes him so good. Stannis will literally do what ever it takes to fulfill his duty, which is sitting the Iron Throne. Renly was a Usurper by all the laws of Westeros, because he lost. Your not a rebel if you win, but Renly did not win, so he was a rebel. I am not saying Stannis would make the perfect King, but he sure as hell would not be a horrible King. Nobody can be a perfect King, because nobody is perfect, but Stannis would make a good fair King.

We (the television audience) know very little about Robert's winning the throne, he was described as a fearsome warrior.  We saw (and heard many times) about what a lousy king and father he was.  This episode showed Stannis being a true leader.  To be honest, I think he was too heroic this episode, it made for GREAT television, but I think it will detract somewhat from his dramatic face turn in Season 4.  Of course 19 episodes of him whining and brooding will likely erase these memories.
956	Jory's Shade	2012-05-30	I really hate them doing this to Stannis's character, he is not evil, and he did not sell his soul to a "demon"(Melisandre), to win the Iron Throne.

I am not sure I agree with this.  Stannis is rigid and determined to sit the Iron Throne because in his eyes, it is his by right.  I get that.  But, he has done evil and made "dark grey" choices to achieve that goal.  Melisandre is "evil" out of good intentions.  She believes the Red God is the true god and that her power is a testament to the truth of her believes, but her decisions and manipulations cannot be construed as anything but "evil", regardless of motivations and intentions.  That is why Jon gave her such short shrift at the Wall.The show can paint them as "evil" without corrupting the nuance of GRRM's character development.  At the end of the day, it is safe to chalk Stannis and the Red Woman up as antagonists.
957	J_Crews	2012-05-30	I love Stannis and always will, even if GRRM kills him or returns him to a dark place.  I won't root for him if the latter occurs, obviously, but I'll grieve for what might have been.  Stannis, in his heart-of-hearts, is a soldier doing what he believes is his duty under every law of Westeros.  He doesn't want to be King; he *IS* King, and, in his eyes, failing to fight for what is his is tantamount to not doing his duty -- an idea so alien to everything he is that he doesn't even consider it.  True, he has no real proof that Cersei's children are what they are, but he knows it to be true; and so duty requires he act upon it, proof be damned.Using Melisandre's magic to kill Renly was a necessity, because Renly commanded the larger force -- a force that Stannis both required in order to take the Iron Throne and should've been his by rights in the first place.  They were all rebels and the only reason he forgave any of them was, again, by necessity.In all honesty, the only thing that I imagine could make Stannis a poor King would be his past ideas of outlawing whoring and gambling.  In every other way, he would be an awesome King who would deal justly with every person and issue on their own merits.

Everything Melisandre does is to achieve her goal of stopping the Others and saving the world, how can that be "evil"? Sure she may be wrong about some things, or she may be right, but either way that doesn't make her evil. She is willing to make necessary sacrifices for the greater good, some of those things may be "bad", but she believes them to be neccisary. Given the evidence she knows, I don't blame her for her decisions. People in power have to be able to make neccisary sacrifices. That's not evil, it's a "necessary evil".

Sandor left the battle because he's surrounded by fire and absolutely terrified of it. He couldn't stay in the King's service after refusing to fight (and he was surely tired of being the Lannisters' dog) so he said "fuck it". In the books Sandor simply offers to take Sansa away from King's Landing, not to Winterfell. It doesn't make any sense in the show universe or the book for him to offer to take her from one (about-to-be) occupied city to another, but that's many of the show changes in a nutshell.

Kills Renly, kills the Castellan of Storm's End, wants to burn Edric Storm, does burn many others, and manipulates Stannis from the first moment.  Her burning of the Lord of Bones was evil and a manipulation of the Night's Watch.  She has done very little good IMHO, unlike Thorros, who could also and should also be criticized for necromancy.  Her intentions are to do the Red God's will to save the world from the Others. "Evil" used to accomplish noble goals is no less "evil", and Melisandre is truly one of the most "evil" characters in the epic.  Ramsey and Joffrey are hollow sociopaths, Melisandre is a far more complex "evil" antagonist.

"Evil" used to accomplish noble goals is no less "evil", and Melisandre is truly one of the most "evil" characters in the epic.  Ramsey and Joffrey are hollow sociopaths, Melisandre is a far more complex "evil" antagonist.Desperate times call for desperate measures? Just kidding, your analysis is spot-on
965	Ghost714	2012-05-30	Melisandre goads an aging Maester into suicide.  Kills Renly, kills the Castellan of Storm's End, wants to burn Edric Storm, does burn many others, and manipulates Stannis from the first moment.  Her burning of the Lord of Bones was evil and a manipulation of the Night's Watch.  She has done very little good IMHO, unlike Thorros, who could also and should also be criticized for necromancy.  Her intentions are to do the Red God's will to save the world from the Others. "Evil" used to accomplish noble goals is no less "evil", and Melisandre is truly one of the most "evil" characters in the epic.  Ramsey and Joffrey are hollow sociopaths, Melisandre is a far more complex "evil" antagonist.Are you truly that naive? First off, that "aging Maester" was trying to kill her. Secondly, Melisandre asked Cressen if he wanted to go through with his folly, she gave him a chance to not drink it, and he did it anyways. That's his fault, not hers, she basically told him it would not kill her, but it would him, and he did it anyways. How is the hell is she to blame?Yes Melisandre did kill Renly and Ser Cortnay Penrose, what of it? They were rebels, they committed treason, a crime punishable by death, and Melisandre did what her King wanted her to do. Rattleshirt deserved to die, and she made it to wear Mance could live. Everybody wanted Mance to live, Jon, Stannis, everybody. However, Stannis's code could not allow him to live, so Melisandre figured out a way around that. A great man got to live, and a horrible man was taken out of the world, how is that evil? Even Mance said they burned the man that they had to. What was needed to be done, was done, except this way Mance got to live. Melisandre then comes up with a way of saving Jon's sister, using Mance. There was nothing evil about that. Do you truly think Rattleshirt didn't deserve to burn for his crimes? Seriously?In Melisandre's POV chapter in ADwD, we get to read her thoughts, and be in her head, and we truly see that she honestly cares about stopping the Others and saving the entire world. She is willing to do what it takes to achieve that goal, and there is such a thing as a "necessary evil". People in power must always be willing to choose the "lesser of two evils". It sounds harsh, but she believes those things are necessary, and given the proof she has seen in her flames, how can you fault her for making those choices. Even if she was wrong, the proof she see's is still very convincing. When it comes to Edric Storm, It may seem harsh, but If I had the proof she did, and if I truly believed it was necessary to sacrifice a child to save the world, then I would do it in a heart beat. So I applaud Melisandre for being able to make those decisions, and for being able to do what it takes to "make it happen", and save the world. I am not saying to make that decision on a whim, but given the evidence Melisandre had, I don't fault her for making that sacrifice.
966	The Eightieth Sentinel	2012-05-31	After watching this episode 5 times, hearing Stannis screaming "nooooooo" when his men are pulling him away still gives me chills. The way the Hound tells Sansa how he's going "some place that isn't burning" also does. I still can't believe how incredible this episode was. 
Big thanks to GRRM and everyone who worked on this one. Also to D&D and HBO for bringing these amazing books to life. Even though there are changes(I'm not a purist but some of the changes just leave me questioning 'why?') I absolutely love the show.
967	A Bong of Ice and Fire	2012-05-31	I really hate them doing this to Stannis's character, he is not evil, and he did not sell his soul to a "demon"(Melisandre), to win the Iron Throne.Ummmm... He pretty much DID sell his soul to a foreign, creepy God to win the Iron Throne.  Everybody thinks Stannis is some super honorable noble guy, but he's actually quite pragmatic and will willing to do whatever it takes to win.
968	Alboin	2012-05-31	Everyone seems to like "Blackwater" (including me), perhaps none of previous episodes received such warm welcome... And such bad ratings,  half a milion fall. Any idea why is this so?
969	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	I know it looked cool, having Stannis be that badass, but I hate what the are implying for the character. You said it yourself, Stannis looked "possessed" and "deranged". The show is making it out to seem like Stannis was unstoppable, but not because he is a naturally skilled swordsman or anything. They are making him seem unstoppable, "because he sold his soul to the devil", and that's why he couldn't be killed.This is backed up by the show having Varys say, "the dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his army's and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse."I really hate them doing this to Stannis's character, he is not evil, and he did not sell his soul to a "demon"(Melisandre), to win the Iron Throne. Melisandre is also not evil, we learn this as the story goes on. I don't know how the show is going to come back from this, that's a major "butterfly effect" IMO, and I am afraid the show will continue to make these two characters black, instead of grey. Even when the show gets to ADwD, I am afraid they will still make these two characters "evil", and that's bullshit IMO, the story is much better with grey characters.I personally believe that, even though Stannis and Melisandre are "grey" characters, overal I would still consider them as "good guys". Just like how Arya has killed in cold blood, but she is still in the catagory of "good", when looking at the big picture.When we first meet Stannis and Melisandre, most of us though they were "bad", but as the story progressed, we learn that's not the case. So I am worried that, even if the show wants to start showing these two characters as not being evil down the road, like in the books, they won't be able to, because they have made them to unredeemable, and to unlikeable. If that makes sense.I don't know about all that. They are into burning people. I don't know how you would feel about burning alive but it definitely wouldn't rank of the best ways to go out for me.
970	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	Are you kidding me? Tyrion did not hold Stannis off until the calvary got there. Did you miss the part of Tyrion saying "fuck me", as like a thousand guys came charging at his small band of troops? Had Tywin and Loras been three minutes later, all of Tyrion's men would have been slaughtered, including Tyrion himself. Same goes for in the book.Stannis would not make a horrible King, it's because he used Melisandre to kill his brother that makes him so good. Stannis will literally do what ever it takes to fulfill his duty, which is sitting the Iron Throne. Renly was a Usurper by all the laws of Westeros, because he lost. Your not a rebel if you win, but Renly did not win, so he was a rebel.I am not saying Stannis would make the perfect King, but he sure as hell would not be a horrible King. Nobody can be a perfect King, because nobody is perfect, but Stannis would make a good fair King.Did I see you were saying his adultery with a Fire Priestess and giving birth to a shadow demon assasin to kill your brother makes you good????

971	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	^ Renly had to die. He was a usurper with no claim to the throne at all who was ready to plunge the realm into war just to become king (he would have gone to war with the Lannisters even if everything else didn't happen) and also kill his brother. Stannis (if he even knew it, which we can't be sure of) handled with him in the most effective way possible (no battle, less dead) that also dealt as little damage as possible to the realm (more men left to take on the horrible Lannisters).  He, as the King, has that duty towards his subjects, bannermen and family. Allowing yourself and all the brave men who marched with you despite the odds to be killed in a close to hopeless battle which would greatly help the corrupt, unlawful regime that sits the Iron Throne as well as ensure the death of your family and allow them to be disinherited is not the way of the King. Other claimants to the throne are the result of incest and adultery, and with all due respect but no one seems to care about adultery much in Westeros (cfr Robert who was well-known for his adultery and nobody gave a crap about it). And if Selyse was your wife, well... It's Westerosi principles, not ours.Ummmm... He pretty much DID sell his soul to a foreign, creepy God to win the Iron Throne.  Everybody thinks Stannis is some super honorable noble guy, but he's actually quite pragmatic and will willing to do whatever it takes to win.Close to everyone in the series prays for magic aid from the Gods. 'Warrior give me strength', 'Seven protect us all', 'May the Old gods protect you', 'Drowned God kill them all' ... The only difference there is, is that R'hllor actually has an impact. That's not selling your soul, that's just being smart and picking the right gun.

972	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	I think there is a slight difference in praying for power and burning people for power. I wouldn't say Renly had to die. If Stannis wasn't such a diffucult S.O.B. he could have just talked to Renly and worked out a comprimise. I think there are other ways to work with people especially your brother than just we think differently so I have to kill you.

973	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	Burning people who are already sentenced to death for power that will help you with your righteous cause, that is. Praying for the gods to strike someone down or help you strike someone down is just the reverse thing: you're still trying to get someone killed. The concept of sacrifice is apparently also not very clear to people: sacrificial magic works in Westeros because the only people who can count on help from the gods are those who are willing to sacrifice and actually pay a price for what they're trying to achieve - why would the Gods aid those who simply pray to them to see to their every need? Why would they want such weak people to succeed?
974	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	I'm trying to follow you here. Giving birth to shadow demon to slay brother makes you kingly. As long as its so your bannermans families wont lose all fighting at one spot so they can march or sail to there doom at KL?

975	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	Seems to me you're simply incorrectly oversimplifying the points I made 'cos you can't handle them. What you're suggesting is that Stannis would choose not to use the power at his command (and again, we are not certain he ordered Melisandre to kill Renly) and either allow his brother to kill him and all of his brave bannermen, disinherit his family and only child, let Baratheon bannermen slaughter each other which is exactly what the horrible Lannisters wanted and needed for them to remain on the throne, or simply wait at his castle until someone comes to do away with him and create a new song 'the Rains of Dragonstone', despite him being the one true King. Yeah, I suppose that makes much more sense, because that's what you would have wanted, or done in his stead. Allow yourself to be killed. Unfortunately, Stannis likes living, he does what he has to do, not what you want him to do, and that's the reason he's still kicking for now.

976	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	I am thinking very differently about results of praying. I believe praying to the weirwoods, the Old Gods, will be the most powerful religion when everything is all said and done.
977	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	Tell that to Ned Stark.
978	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	Well he didn't choose to use that same power at KL and that is your whole reasoning why he is so great because he used it against his brother. Renly was marching to KL, slowly but marching. Ready to take out the Lannisters and get rid of all the bad you are claiming Stannis is going to due away with. He saves no one at this nonbattle they just all die at KL instead.
979	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	Last I checked the story wasn't over yet
980	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	Renly was a rebel and nothing more. Allowing him to take King's Landing would just have been swapping one regime that had to be destroyed for another. Plus Renly would have eventually killed him if he didn't act so his actions are perfectly reasonable. Stannis is the King, and should have been the Lord of Storm's End and had the more powerful bannermen Renly was commanding as well. There is no reason he should not be allowed to stand up and defend his law- and tradition given rights from the people who would deny them from him when someone like Renly who crowns himself King on the sole basis of 'having a big army and thinking I'm great' does get your sympathy. Basically the true wrongdoers in this regard are the Tyrells, even from your point of view, because they and no one else saved the Lannister's asses and allowed them to continue their atrocities, such as the Red Wedding.
If Bran gets the ability to Warg into people / creatures through Weirwoods it may become powerful. But they still wouldn't be Gods. Don't expect people to take something you say seriously if you can't back it up with evidence.

The FACTS are he lead everyone to their death. I'm not quite sure how you could see it any other way.There's quite a big difference between people dying in a pitched battle, trying and very nearly succeeding to take a walled-city versus if Stannis had thrown his pitifully small force against Renly's huge host, trying to beat him conventionally.  That dog won't hunt, dude.  All of the Stormlords owed their allegiance to Renly who, in turn, owed his to Stannis as the elder brother and thus the leader of House Baratheon.  The Tyrells, technically, should've stayed loyal to Joffrey if not Stannis.  Loras, being daddy Mace's favorite, however, convinced him to back lover boy Renly instead.  People also seem to be missing the fact that, from their standpoint, it was always about the Tyrells gaining power.  Renly would have been a puppet-King, at best.  The Tyrells are very good at the game.
984	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	Stannis wasn't Lord of Storm's End and all the bannerman don't follow him because he is a miserable S.O.B that can't get along with anyone.

The FACTS are he lead everyone to their death. I'm not quite sure how you could see it any other way.Oh yeah, calling me a prick, that's gonna work. Melisandre wouldn't have had much of an impact on the Blackwater, plus Stannis' claim would always have been disputed because he 'gained it through magic' if she was there, which would lead to even more instability and war later on. The wildfire only worked because of Imry Florent's mistake, and Stannis was actually leading his men to victory and was extremely close to victory before the unexpected reinforcements arrived. It's not like he 'lead them there to die' or with the intent of losing his army, 'I don't see how you could believe that'. Are you in your right mind to be suggesting Stannis should *always* avoid combat? He should avoid hopeless combat, and the attack on King's Landing was by no means hopeless. His bannermen knew the risk of attacking King's Landing. The only ones who should kill are those who are ready to die. You cannot compare his situation with Renly with the attack on King's Landing - King's Landing was a tougher nut to crack and Melisandre already remarked she can't endlessly use the same trick. Even if Melisandre somehow killed every command / noble in the city (which would be impossible), the city would still be loyal to the Lannisters until it was taken with a military assault. And again you're oversimplifying. Stannis didn't lose his entire army - actually those who remained loyal to him and didn't flee because they thought they saw Renly's ghost were mostly lead back safely to King's Landing thanks to Stannis' tactical ingenuity. He started out with about 2000 men, and he had about 2000 left after the Blackwater again.Stannis wasn't Lord of Storm's End and all the bannerman don't follow him because he is a miserable S.O.B that can't get along with anyone.Again you fail. He *should* have been lord of Storm's End by tradition, however Robert chose to insult him by giving him Dragonstone. The men Renly had taken with him were converted by him, the others would have been converted as well if they hadn't been stopped by Loras Tyrell. He gained the support of the Night's Watch and the mountain tribes as well as many Northern Lords when he went to the Wall. Turns out he can get along with people and you shouldn't always believe everything every character says about another character.It was Stannis's choice to put himself at the time up against Renlys army of which he can't defeat.And look, it worked! The set-up was to first treat with his brother, then convincing Renly's army to join him instead. And it worked. He didn't have the army for a head-on attack on anyone at the time. If he had done nothing, it would've only been a matter of time until someone had attacked him, because he, as the King, would always be a threat to any pretender.

987	J_Crews	2012-05-31	Stannis wasn't Lord of Storm's End and all the bannerman don't follow him because he is a miserable S.O.B that can't get along with anyone.Renly was Lord of Storm's End and so they owed him their fealty... but Renly owed his fealty to Stannis as the head of his house.  That's why Stannis followed Robert's lead when he rebelled, even though he agonized over it because he knew the Targs were the rightful kings, and that's why Renly was honor-bound to follow Stannis' lead.
988	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	Just not buying it. Whether he intended on leading all his men to die or not doesn't really matter. He isn't a great king he lead them to there doom. I guess your reasoning is that because the surprise host(Renly's ghost) showed up and defeated him that its not his fault. Information is power and the fact that he didn't know that this army was coming to crush him makes him an even weaker choice for king.
989	J_Crews	2012-05-31	It was Stannis's choice to put himself at the time up against Renlys army of which he can't defeat.That's another misconception.  Stannis chose nothing.  He *IS* King.  Not fighting to secure that claim over all the usurpers running around would be failing in his duty; that's why he can't just step aside.
990	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	Nope. No one would have done better in his stead. Renly had no battle experience at all and had probably pissed himself the moment he saw the wildfire. Joffrey? Don't make me laugh. Balon has no knowledge of land tactics. The prerequisites for the army taking Stannis' host by surprise were so many that it was always going to be very unlikely. It already started with Edmure Tully disobeying his orders. If you believe Stannis shouldn't be King because his scouts, luck, the knights he sent to convert the rest of Renly's host, and ultimately his army failed him and he failed to predict everything that would happen and didn't defeat a 80 000 men host with what little men he had while attacking a city, you're clearly just bullshitting and making stuff up because you think 'Stannis is a miserable SOB'. If that's the prerequisite for becoming King, you might as well already melt down the Iron Throne LOL. You have very little, if any, arguments at all, and all you've so far managed to say is 'hurr durr me no liek King Stannis.'

992	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	Because Robert didn't give him Storm's End to insult him despite him holding it for him and keeping the Tyrell host busy (decisive for the outcome of his rebellion) because Robert didn't like him. This is proven in one of Cersei's chapters in AFFC and again by Cersei in A Clash Of Kings in one of Tyrion's chapters I think. Seriously, you should stop posting.

993	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	Your just making excuses for him. Great leaders win the fight and he lost. According to you its acceptaple because he didn't know Tywin and the Tyrells are marching on him and the wildfire plan. He went about it with less intel and a weaker plan than the Lannisters and lost. Even you would have to say he got his ass handed to him so I'm not sure what you could try and argue.

Answer: see what you quotedYou're hopelessly deluded, and I'm starting to think you're just here as a troll.  Stannis wasn't Lord of Storms End because Robert was a prick who repayed his loyalty by insulting him.  Robert never loved either of his brothers, but, at the time, Renly was young, and Robert had no idea he would eventually grow into a man who cared more about fancy clothes and throwing masquerade balls than whoring, and drinking, and warring.  Otherwise, he would've shunned him too, probably.Being nice is a pathetic prerequisite to have for a King.Also, this discussion should probably have it's own thread.

996	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	Anyone would have lost that battle under those circumstances. It was a close defeat, he nearly took King's Landing. It's also irrelevant to him being a good King or not. His host was mostly comprised of the vainglorious Knights of Summer that followed the fool Renly. He had to march them or lose them, so attacking King's Landing was the only viable option. Seriously, out of all the Stannis-haters on this board, you're easily the most laughable one with the least argument,s if you would call them that ('hurr he lost a battle he can't be King'). You're just throwing bits of shit at a concrete wall, hoping to tear it down and ignoring the boulders that are falling on your head and the people around you that are laughing at you. Nuff said.
Stannis is not a 'miserable SOB who doesn't get along with anyone.' He has a tarnished reputation because of Robert's (unjustified) hatred of him and no one can hold anything concretely wrong he did against him, they just have a general dislike of Stannis based on general opinion, not facts. Stannis convinced the Night's Watch and the Northmen, amongst others, to aid him. So he does get along with people, just not with people who decide hating him and going with the flow is the easier and safer option. People will be ruled by whoever has the power to come over and kill them if they disagree with them, which is the only reason the Lannisters still have 'support' after they fucked up the country so badly, and the only reason the Boltons are still Wardens of the North while they have spit on the most sacred of laws, killed people for fun, and whatever other shit Ramsay did. It doesn't justify any of them.

But I can at least see where you are coming from. You thought Robert was the prick. I thought Stannis was the prick. He they probably both are but the feelings of most in Westeros seem to be that they don't like Stannis and think he is. I wouldn't go giving him diplomat of the year because he saved the nightswatch in their hour of need and then tried to bully them into giving everything they had up. The nightswatch did what they had to do to survive Stannis.
998	Jory's Shade	2012-05-31	Are you truly that naive?First off, that "aging Maester" was trying to kill her. Secondly, Melisandre asked Cressen if he wanted to go through with his folly, she gave him a chance to not drink it, and he did it anyways. That's his fault, not hers, she basically told him it would not kill her, but it would him, and he did it anyways. How is the hell is she to blame?Yes Melisandre did kill Renly and Ser Cortnay Penrose, what of it? They were rebels, they committed treason, a crime punishable by death, and Melisandre did what her King wanted her to do.Rattleshirt deserved to die, and she made it to wear Mance could live. Everybody wanted Mance to live, Jon, Stannis, everybody. However, Stannis's code could not allow him to live, so Melisandre figured out a way around that. A great man got to live, and a horrible man was taken out of the world, how is that evil? Even Mance said they burned the man that they had to. What was needed to be done, was done, except this way Mance got to live. Melisandre then comes up with a way of saving Jon's sister, using Mance. There was nothing evil about that. Do you truly think Rattleshirt didn't deserve to burn for his crimes? Seriously?In Melisandre's POV chapter in ADwD, we get to read her thoughts, and be in her head, and we truly see that she honestly cares about stopping the Others and saving the entire world. She is willing to do what it takes to achieve that goal, and there is such a thing as a "necessary evil".People in power must always be willing to choose the "lesser of two evils". It sounds harsh, but she believes those things are necessary, and given the proof she has seen in her flames, how can you fault her for making those choices. Even if she was wrong, the proof she see's is still very convincing. When it comes to Edric Storm, It may seem harsh, but If I had the proof she did, and if I truly believed it was necessary to sacrifice a child to save the world, then I would do it in a heart beat. So I applaud Melisandre for being able to make those decisions, and for being able to do what it takes to "make it happen", and save the world. I am not saying to make that decision on a whim, but given the evidence Melisandre had, I don't fault her for making that sacrifice.Thank God JFK didn't think this way.  Evil done out of necessity is no less evil.  War and self defense is not evil.  It is a human reality.  Using shadow craft to achieve noble goals sells your soul and cannot be justified by the ends justifies the means.  Personally, I hope the Prince Who Was Promised has a different lore than Azor Ahai because if Jon is to wield Lightbringer, it is my hope the sword was not truly forged in the heart of Azor Ahai's wife.  I hold out hope that R'hllor's version of the return of Azor Ahai is different from Rhaegar and Aemon's version that we have not heard.
999	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	Maybe I'm the only one that thinks using a shadow demon to kill your brother makes you evil. Maybe I'm the only one who doesn't see what triumphant battle planning Stannis has ever used. Maybe I'm the only one that thinks you need to be capable at diplomacy to be a good king. And maybe I'm the only one who thinks burning people alive for power makes you evil.
1000	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	If you are blind to the reasons behind those actions which I already mentioned and King Stannis' victories which I already summed up, not to mention the fact he's survived a lot of people who you think are somehow more competent than him despite being killed (after all in your view a good king has to be successful at everything and be able to predict everything) then yes, you're the only one who thinks so. Not to mention you don't get what these books are about if you want to think in purely black and white terms such as good and evil so badly. I've already mentioned all these reasons and totally owned you in previous posts, I'm not going to start this over from the start again. Seriously, your argumentation is so weak to the point it seems you're simply trying to troll people. If you're hoping Stannis will die so that the Red Wedding Alliance and Ramsay Snow will rule 'happily' ever after, you really don't have a case for calling anyone evil. In fact, that makes you evil.'War and self defense is not evil. It is a human reality.'Renly: not self defense at all because no one was threatening him prior to his declaration as King, starts a pointless war, is ready to kill his brother. Stannis: commits self defense and kills Renly, although you're again stupidly ignoring the fact we can't be sure Stannis actually ordered Mel to do that.'Using shadow craft to achieve noble goals sells your soul and cannot be justified by the ends justifies the means.'Yes it can. Sending thousands to their graves and destroying your future goals in the process, being totally oblivious to and uncaring of the lives of those who follow you and those who should follow you is worse. Everyone in the series prays for divine intervention and magic assistance, the only real difference is that Stannis chose the right gun and his magic actually works. Shadow magic is not necessarily evil: it revived Beric Dondarrion, for instance. To say 'it's bad simply because it's magic' is bullshit. Westeros is a fantasy realm. And it does not sell your soul. Are you one of Varys' little birds, perhaps, imitating his speech?

1001	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	And look, it worked! The set-up was to first treat with his brother, then convincing Renly's army to join him instead. And it worked. He didn't have the army for a head-on attack on anyone at the time. If he had done nothing, it would've only been a matter of time until someone had attacked him, because he, as the King, would always be a threat to any pretender. I guess your definition of worked is different than mine. I think using black magic to kill your brother so you can take all his bannerman to die in KL is failing.

And maybe I'm the only one who thinks burning people alive for power makes you evil.But sticking a sword through someone for power doesn't?   I would have to guess that Dany then is evil as well since she burned MMD and brought to life dragons.  And anyone that uses oil in a siege to drop on the attackers is evil because they are using fire for power.It's a tool he had available to him.  He used it.
1003	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	My previous posts already covered that more than well enough. He had to march those impetuous bastards to King's Landing or lose them. You think they'd follow a King who would choose to just sit on his ass after the glory they'd been promised by Renly? You lose and are clearly too stupid to understand base logic or apply the details in the story to your 'opinions'. Stop trolling.
I'm certain you wouldn't be here moaning about Renly if he had shoved a sword through Stannis (which was his intention) and going all 'uhh he killed his brother he's BAD' so you might as well just shut up.

He did not take them there to die, he took them there to win and - even with the wildfire - it was working.  The only thing that saved KL was the Tyrells.  As was stated, if Renly's Ghost gets there maybe even just a few minutes later, they are attacking walls and not mens backs.
1005	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	You are the one pumping him as a great king and now you are saying he is a grey character. Honestly the books are full of grey characters I just don't even think Stannis is one of them. He is evil by most every definition, at least in my mind.

1007	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	It's okay, he started by calling me a prick some posts ago. By now the 'level' of his posts and argumentation has sunk so low that I'm positive he's just trolling and I'm just trying to end the 'conversation'.He is evil by most every definition, at least in my mind.And not in mine, or most people. Most people see the Red Wedding Alliance and Ramsay Snow as evil, the exact same people Stannis is fighting. GRRM called Stannis 'perhaps the only true hero of the series.' So we have strong reasons to believe Stannis is a grey character whereas you only have 'hurr I don't like him' going for you.

That was step one and the next step ended in epic failure. So clearly his plan didn't work. I mean these are not grey subjects.
1009	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	I don't disagree about Ramsey but because others are evil doesn't make Stannis good. Joffery is probably the most pure evil character in the books.
1010	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	Hopefully all true heroes look to burn children, not!
1011	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	Stannis didn't burn any children. He thought it was a good thing to do for Davos to get Edric to safety and continued to trust and respect Davos' council.that is a very fair statement since you declared how his plan worked so well not fighting Renly and getting his bannerman. That was step one and the next step ended in epic failure. So clearly his plan didn't work. I mean these are not grey subjects.Even a good plan sometimes doesn't work because of external factors. Robb Stark had a good plan to lure Tywin towards him and then have Edmure cut off his retreat, but instead Edmure held off Tywin despite his orders and ruined Robb's plan much in the same way Stannis' men also failed him. Does that make Robb Stark an idiot? I don't think so. Nor does it make Stannis an idiot. If he had just sat at his castle, he would have lost. His 20 000 men were worth nothing if he didn't use them and would have left him if he didn't attack King's Landing, and he got very close to achieving his goal. No one could see those 80 000 men coming, and no one would have defeated them if they were in Stannis' stead.I don't disagree about Ramsey but because others are evil doesn't make Stannis good.Stannis is only fighting because there are people like Ramsay who would deny him his throne. If they didn't, Stannis could and would rule peacefully and would make a far better King than Robert or Aerys. Or Joffrey. Plus Stannis is the only one who has made an effort to provide defence against the Others who are probably worse than all the human enemies.

1013	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	Robert on the other hand, was a quite merry and pleasant fellow. So pleasant, in fact, that he became blind to his enemies, allowed corruption like Janos Slynt's deeds to spread without another word and caused the Kingdom to become bankrupt. I'm sure we need our Kings to be pleasant!

1016	TheDarkOne	2012-05-31	It is kind of odd how the episode made Stannis appear to be the villain. It makes me wonder if they aren't trying to frame the show in a way so it's easier for people to root for certain characters as heroes. Stannis to me is the most heroic character in the series.
The thing I find most attractive about Martin's work is the duality that is presented in each character. That duality however doesn't lend itself to the traditional construct of protagonist versus antagonist. I hope we don't see the show try to make him the uber bad guy.
But, considering GRRMs involvement in writing the episode, maybe Stannis will transform into the villain. I hope not.

The good magic comes from The Children of the Forest.  I'll take Bran's magic and Dany's magic over shadow craft anyday.  Know that.  Conjuring up shadow beasts and using dweomers to shapeshift and make faux lightbringers are weak parlor tricks compared to Dragon fire.

1019	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	Yes.Stannis is not a pleasant guy. Boho, that's doesn't make everyone else not a traitor. It does make it so he is not Lord of Storms End was my point.
1020	DurararaFTW	2012-05-31	It does make it so he is not Lord of Storms End was my point.No, it doesn't. Not being the lord of Storm's end or a pleasant guy doesn't change the fact that as Ned says he is Robert's one true heir. And therefore, Robert dying makes him King.
1021	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	Berric and Lady Stoneheart are abominations not unlike a Wight.  The "right gun" is Dany's Dragons.  Get right with that.

Conjuring up shadow beasts and using dweomers to shapeshift and make faux lightbringers are weak parlor tricks compared to Dragon fire.I'm prone to agree on Stoneheart, but she was given life by Beric and not by a Red Priest. Beric did a lot of good, that's why he has the people's support. Dany's dragons are awesome but not as effective a weapon as the Shadows if you look at them from a 'potential innocent victims' and 'control' scale. The Shadows take out 1 target without danger of hitting another, the Dragons go on wild hunts and eat people's cattle and perhaps even children if we can believe the claims of the man in ADWD. They are definitely the most powerful, but a great liability as well and they are only prone to doing good because Dany is prone to doing good. That said I hope the dragons will turn out to be a force for good, I just don't take anything for granted with George.That wasn't really my point though as Stannis had no access to Dragons, he just picked the religion that had the best results for him and his bannermen so far. The Seven haven't showed any real power yet, but you can bet on it the Lannisters would like the Warrior to strike their enemies down if they believed he could.I'm very skeptical about the Children of the Forest. I don't think they're as good as they say and I don't think Bran wants to become an abomination like Bloodraven... and I don't think they'll give him a choice.You'll have to look for that interview yourself as I don't save / remember the location of every single interview GRRM ever did across his wide-spanning career. I'm not going to make something like that up, but if you won't take my word for it then fine.edit: this one gets close though.http://asoiaf.wester...ording-to-grrm/

1022	Jory's Shade	2012-05-31	I read that quote and agree.  Stannis is righteous.  I wouldn't equate that to him being a true hero.  I categorize Bran, Brienne, and Jon as true heroes.  I also do not consider Stannis evil; rather, he has been corrupted by evil.  He was very pious prior to turning to the Lord of Light and has become a great zealot for R'hllor since his conversion.  Stannis is not a "believer" like Matthos Seaworth, but he understands the Red God gives him the power he will need to win the Game of Thrones given his inferior troop and naval position.  I get that and do not fault Stannis for using all the tools at his disposal to take what is his by right, in his mind at least.  I just am not willing to ignore that it is the wrong path.
I feel the Red God is evil and corrupts righteous people with the lies it shows in its flames.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Thorros but consider him a rogue priest that is fearful of his visions and reticant to use the power of the Lord of Light, unlike Melisandre or the Red Priests in Volantis and Braavos.  At the end of the day, I think the Lord of Light is the Lord of Lies and not a source of good.
Dragons are pure magic made mortal.  They are the most devastating power in the world that must be tamed to protect the world from pure uncontrolled magic being unleashed.  Dany is the key to controlling this power.  That is why she is the mother of dragons.  I cannot wait to see what happens with Euron's horn and how that will effect Dany's dragons.
I too have reservations about the Children of the Forest, but I am not sure I consider Bloodraven an abomination.  I will have to see how the remaining Dunk & Egg stories and the final books come out, but I think there is still much to learn about how and why Bloodraven has become what he was when he met Bran.  What we do know is that Greenseers and The Children seem to have more accurate visions than the Lord of Light's lies, and that GRRM has a grand plan for Bran.  Also, the North still has the old magic, e.g. direwolves and giants, so that is why I am putting my skeptical eggs in the Children's basket.
Hell, maybe Tywin and Cersei are right: the gods are just cruel, not just the seven...
1023	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	I looked at Stannis going to the wall as his only option left. He had hardly any friends. He needed to gather another army to take the throne. He knew he wouldn't find any friends in the south. So really he went to the wall for selfish reasons. He figured that he could play up saving the realm from wildlings and booting the ironborn. Every northman could rally behind those causes as they probably have dealt with wildling attacks before and bore no love for the Greyjoys. All to give Stannis one more opportunity to take the throne.

1025	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	It's completely the other way around Arbor. He went to the wall first, not to White Harbour or any other castle to ask for their aid. He went to the Wall to aid them, knowing full well the Night's Watch would not enlarge his army. He did not make efforts to contact the Northern lords / hillmen until Jon suggested it to him. In fact it even diminished his chances. For Stannis it is a great sacrifice to go to the Wall - he leaves Dragonstone and Storm's End in a weak state of defence. The other lords do have the resources and men to send people to the Wall, they are not as hard-pressed as Stannis, yet they don't go there. What more do you need than GRRM himself saying it was a righteous move to not see something Stannis did as a completely evil act? Jezus you're biased, really.I'm skeptical about the Lord of Light as well but like all tools I believe they can be used for good or for bad and like all religions it's never good if you drive it too far. The High Sparrow for example has only caused trouble so far. Stannis however, makes an agreement with non-believers and has both believers as unbelievers in his ranks. This hints he's very much capable of religious tolerance and the Red God's power could definitely be a good thing if used for good as opposed to the Seven who have so far proven useless, if not only because R'hllor seems like a counterpart to the Great Other. Take Moqorro healing Victarion for instance - maybe not such a good thing considering what Victarion did afterwards, but there's always the potential to use this power for good like it was used on Beric. I was very skeptical about Melisandre's intentions for a long time as well but her POV reveals she does genuinely want to use her power stop the Others. Keeping Mance Rayder alive instead of Rattleshirt thanks to the glamour was another good act imo.

1026	7V3N	2012-05-31	For the discussion about the show making Stannis look evil:Just listen to the Stannis theme music (skip to 3:50 to see what I mean). It reminds me of the Lord Of The Rings orc theme music. They never humanized him with Cressen and have made Davos' bias much more immediately obvious.

1027	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	Now that you mention it, it is kinda similar. Stannis seems to have gained a lot of fans thanks to the Blackwater though - I think viewers right now are more concerned with how interesting a character is rather than purely how good or evil they are by now because they were tricked once into liking Ned Stark and then seeing him die and have come to realize GoT is not so much a case of good or bad. That was quite a hit for many I can imagine. A lot of people like Tywin Lannister as well despite him giving two downright evil orders (though, maybe they just forgot). I do kinda like the theme music and I tend to be positive and attribute it to the music trying to underline Stannis isn't going to f- around and is a force to be reckoned with. Also his scenes usually take place in places that are dark and full of terror - on a boat in the middle of the ocean, in the creepy place Dragonstone is... It's difficult to put in words, but despite the dark atmosphere of the soundtrack I feel it still has something heroic to it.

Jezus you're biased, really.Yes he went to the wall first so he could be seen as savior of the realm. He is going to make Jon Lord of Winterfell to rally the north. Jon refuses so he is going to take a bunch of wildlings with him. This is when Jon suggests that taking wildlings wouldn't help his cause of rallying the North to his side. That he knows where the northerners are who can't wait to throw the ironborn out.

1031	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	First you're going to argue Stannis is not a good commander, then you're going to argue he doesn't respect Davos? You're unbelievable. He didn't burn Edric Storm, and he wasn't going to burn Edric Storm either - Melisandre wanted to burn him but Stannis hadn't made a decision in the matter yet. Otherwise he would have long burned before Davos could even get to him. Stannis didn't have Davos locked up or punished for getting Edric Storm out either.Funny how you chose those words, for the supposed Azor Ahai reborn.It was intentional.

I said he got taught the lesson from Davos.I was definitley saying he respected Davos. So much he followed his advice to the wall. Davos knows Stannis about as good as anyone. Who better to judge when he feels like Stannis is going to burn the kid than him. The third death of joffrey  happens and three kings have died of which Melisandre foretold. And she is preaching to burn him for his kingsblood and Davos feels Stannis is going to do it and ships him off.
1033	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	I guess your thinking of what lies ahead if Stannis lives = Stannis is Azor Azhai reborn, he bears Lightbringer and he is just getting some men to fight the war at the wall since this where the real battle for mankind unfolds.    
My thinking of what lies ahead if he lives = Stannis is gathering an army of Northmen, He plans to team up with White Harbor to crush the Freys, en route to KL. He does not wield Lightbringer its a false sword. He is not Azor.
1034	Jory's Shade	2012-05-31	Our argument over Stannis is moot.  Stannis is dead."Your false kind is dead, bastard. He and all his host were smashed in seven days of battle.  I have his magic sword.  Tell his red whore."Ramsey wouldn't lie, we all know that...
1035	Jory's Shade	2012-05-31	I get your POV S&D, but I am in the f*ck the Red God camp.
1036	Ghost714	2012-05-31	Everyone seems to like "Blackwater" (including me), perhaps none of previous episodes received such warm welcome... And such bad ratings,  half a milion fall. Any idea why is this so?"Blackwater" did have the lowest ratings of the season, for the initial airing of the episode, but according to the Wiki, it was 3.38 million US views, not half a million. That's because of memorial day, and there was some NBA basket ball shit on to, I dunno what it's called I hate basket ball. However, the Blackwater episode has done really really good on the rewatches, from people with On-Demand and DVR's. Also tons of people have watched the episode when they replay it through the week.I was a little pist about that though, I was sure this would be the episode to get over 4 million US views on the initial airing. Why didn't they play the Blackwater episode this Sunday? They could have had a week break inbetween the 8th and 9th episodes, and the ratings would have been much higher. I mean it still did really well considering the holiday and stuff, but I still think they should have pushed the episode back. HBO kind of took a leap of faith giving them the extra money for the Blackwater episode, I just hope they didn't screw it up by playing the episode last Sunday. Watch, now next time when they ask for more money, HBO will be like, "fuck that, last time we did that the most expensive episode got the worst ratings". I hope that does not happen. The show has been so close this season to hitting 4 million, I just really hope the finale can get there, or higher.On a side note, I was looking at the ratings for the show the Borgias, and it only gets around half a million US views every episode. So compared to that show on Showtime, Game of Thrones is killing it. I am curious though, how is it they can have like a thousand horses in every scene on the Borgias, but Game of Thrones can hardly ever use horses, even when they are terribly needed? Game of Thrones has like 7 times more viewers than the Borgias, on average, so surly Thrones would have a much bigger budget right? I just don't get it, and it's not like the Borgias only spends their budget on horses either, they have pretty good sets and stuff. Can anybody shed some light on this?
1037	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	My understanding was HBO signed GoT for three seasons based off the pilot episode. So the budget was set in writing before any ratings were accumulated other than test screenings and such. So the deal is  the deal if you know what I'm saying but future seasons will depend on the ratings heavily. I think HBO knows they have a show that is tuff to watch only once so there ON Demand is blowing up the replays and they know it. Its probably working wonders for bringing along HBOGo as well.
1038	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	There was mention of raising a stone dragon at Dragonstone. They were going to burn Edric to raise the stone dragon supposedly. Only thing I know that fits that bill is Xaros Valaryian Stone Vault.Can you think of anything else that would fit that bill?
1039	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-31	That vault has like a titanium dragon battle armor or something

1041	StannisandDaeny	2012-06-01	I said he got taught the lesson from Davos.I was definitley saying he respected Davos. So much he followed his advice to the wall. Davos knows Stannis about as good as anyone. Who better to judge when he feels like Stannis is going to burn the kid than him. The third death of joffrey  happens and three kings have died of which Melisandre foretold. And she is preaching to burn him for his kingsblood and Davos feels Stannis is going to do it and ships him off.Stannis wasn't going to burn him, in fact the only reason Davos had time to act is because he was opposed to the idea. You think Edric would have lived if Stannis had wanted to burn him? He was vA©ry skeptical on that point and wanted proof the leeches were effective first, and even then you can't say 'he was going to burn him' because he never gave the order. I suppose if we're going to carry this logic we should also lock up everyone who sees a hot girl on the streets and thinks of doing them because hey, they're rapists... They didn't do anything, but they're still rapists, right? After all, you don't have to do something or be certain you're going to do something to be guilty of it...As for the Azor Ahai bullshit, yeah Stannis is not Azor Ahai. Duh. Doesn't mean he can't kick ass. You think he doesn't know that? The red religion is a means to and end for him, nothing more. It's just a good rallying call, it inspires the troops, and Lightbringer, while not more powerful than another sword, still carries a reputation (see how they melted Ice to have a counterpart to it), so it's just a smart and good move to go along with it even if you don't believe in it. Robb Stark wasn't able to turn into a wolf, but the story still spread fear among his enemies. Garlan Tyrell wasn't the ghost of Renly, but his deception worked as well. It worked, and that's what matters. Ever heard the saying the truth is the first casualty of war? Why do you think Stannnis' few remaining men still follow him with so much conviction? That's where the true power lies.

1042	7V3N	2012-06-01	I have recently been rewatching Band of Brothers and The Pacific and it was upsetting. They were so great that they consistently put Blackwater to shame. There is obviously a huge difference in budgets, but why so?!
1043	BlackTalon	2012-06-01	I am currently watching The Pacific and the first six episodes at least have definitely NOT put Blackwater to shame. I can barely keep the characters apart, the only two I know by name so far is that Leckie guy and Basilone, and him only because he got the MoH. (I have to admit though the two chicks from episode two are a match for anything GOT has come up with ^ ^)
Also, keep in mind that there are still tons of WW II surplus and war materiel (rifles, uniforms, cars, tanks, planes ...) around they could use for the show, that is a LOT cheaper than a show like GOT where EVERYTHING from the shoelaces upwards has to be specially designed and made. Plus, it is all either jungle, indoor studio or ordinary city streets cleared of modern signs.
1044	J_Crews	2012-06-01	My understanding was HBO signed GoT for three seasons based off the pilot episode. So the budget was set in writing before any ratings were accumulated other than test screenings and such. So the deal is  the deal if you know what I'm saying but future seasons will depend on the ratings heavily. I think HBO knows they have a show that is tuff to watch only once so there ON Demand is blowing up the replays and they know it. Its probably working wonders for bringing along HBOGo as well.No.  They greenlit season 2 after the pilot aired, then greenlit season 3 after several of this season's episodes aired.  HBO has never, to my knowledge greenlit 2 seasons at once of any show, and likely never will.  Season 2 also got an increased budget based off of the success of season 1... which has payed off in spades; seasons 2's lowest-rated episode had more viewers than the highest-rate episode from season 1.  Taken as an average of each week, season 2 has seen an increase of over 1.2 million viewers over the 1st season, which was already considered a big success.

1045	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-06-01	Good to know I guess my friend didn't know what he was talking about when he told me that then. I did read somewhere that it was doing better than Sopranos which is impressive.
1046	Zappotack	2012-06-01	One thing I just noticed where/when did Tyrion lose his helmet because I recall Pod giving it to him but then he doesn't have it with Mandon...
1047	J_Crews	2012-06-01	Good to know I guess my friend didn't know what he was talking about when he told me that then. I did read somewhere that it was doing better than Sopranos which is impressive.It's averaging more viewers than The Sopranos did in their 1st season when looking at it by averages.  Later seasons blew GoT's numbers out of the water, though (first run live-airing ratings, that is), but that's to be expected.  A mob show will always draw a more diverse audience than the fantasy genre.  When you factor in GoT's numbers from HBOGo, On Demand, and repeat airings our numbers look closer to Sopranos-esque ratings... but there was no such thing as HBOGo back then and On Demand was very new and not at all in widespread use.  Therefore, it's difficult to make such a comparison.
1048	legba11	2012-06-01	GOT's ratings are excellent, we don't need to worry (yet).  It is doing better than Boardwalk Empire, which is is equally expensive.  True Blood does much better, and is cheaper, but that show is a weird spike in their ratings.  HBO does not carry about initial viewings like normal networks because they do not pay for their shows with ads.  Whether you watched the show at Sunday, 9pm or Tuesday 4am (on HBO Go), you are paying for an HBO subscription, which is how they make money.
1049	boojam	2012-06-01	Did I miss something?Shae is Lorathi?So is Jaqen.... ? (Which I think we don't know for sure...being who he is).I am guessing no connection between them... and in the book seems no way Shae could be a FM, knowing what happens to her.
1050	Greywolf2375	2012-06-01	Berric and Lady Stoneheart are abominations not unlike a Wight.  The "right gun" is Dany's Dragons.  Get right with that.  The good magic comes from The Children of the Forest.  I'll take Bran's magic and Dany's magic over shadow craft anyday.  Know that.  Conjuring up shadow beasts and using dweomers to shapeshift and make faux lightbringers are weak parlor tricks compared to Dragon fire.The magic that allows you to dominate another persons mind?Or the magic that allows you to burn a child to death with its breathe?There is no "good" magic, just as there is no "bad" magic.  It is all in how it is used.
1051	Arawni	2012-06-01	And not in mine, or most people. Most people see the Red Wedding Alliance and Ramsay Snow as evil, the exact same people Stannis is fighting. GRRM called Stannis 'perhaps the only true hero of the series.' So we have strong reasons to believe Stannis is a grey character whereas you only have 'hurr I don't like him' going for you.So... Assassinating your own brother via some shadow monster to avoid blood shed is not evil, but assassinating a leader of a rival house via deception to avoid blood shed is evil? If Stannis's actions can be justified by "choosing the lesser evil", that same reasoning should apply to Tywin's actions too, right?You can label me a troll, too, because I find these excuses for Stannis's actions almost appalling. I seriously don't mean that as a personal offence, I was just... well, surprised. I can see necessity of his actions and yes, they can be defended from the pragmatical point of view. Killing Renly DID prevent blood shed between Baratheon bannermen although I simply cannot believe anybody would do such a deed just because of the "duty" or just to save his soldiers. Actually latter is implausible also because Stannis felt no qualms during the Blackwater when he sent his troops to die (and win, yes, but he was prepared in "thousands" dying in the process).However, morally I cannot help but seeing his deed not only disgusting but also cowardly. Even if one considers Renly as an usurper, sending a shadow monster to kill him in secret is a dishonourable way to get rid of usurper. People who break the rules should be executed, not assassinated in the dark. That is not justice, that is cowardice. Practical, maybe, but also dishonourable and dishonest.Many here say that Stannis would be a good king but I don't really see it. This is not because he has burned people alive or because he assassinated his brother (or at least turned the blind eye when Melisandre did it). A man could be a good king even though he has done such things - a good king is not necessarily a good man. But there are other qualities in Stannis that do make me doubt his ability to be a good king and a leader. He's seemingly rather uncharismatic and not well liked. There must be a reason why is is not liked and not only do I think that reason might hinder his abolity to be a good king, also the mere fact that ruling effectively when your administrative layer (= lords who implement kings commands) dislikes you, is very, very difficult. It is even more difficult when a man is seemingly obsessed with duty and does not make compromises.No, I cannot see Stannis as a good king. People who place duty above everything and see world white and black are not usually good rulers. They are tyrants. Maybe, MAYBE, if Stannis got very good advisers who could influence him, his rule could be ok, but if he would take the sole command - well, I doubt I would want to live in his kingdom. I'm sure that Stannis means well but as they say, road to Hell is paved with good intentions.(I do point out, however, that my impressions of Stannis's character and personal traits concerns HBO Stannis ONLY.)P.S. One more thing... Even though I do think that Stannis would not be a good king, I do like the character and don't consider him to be evil. I don't like some things he has done, namely killing his brother and how it was done, but I do find him interesting and in many ways symphatetic, also. So this is not "I just don't like Stannis" rant by any means.

1052	Arawni	2012-06-01	No, it doesn't. Not being the lord of Storm's end or a pleasant guy doesn't change the fact that as Ned says he is Robert's one true heir. And therefore, Robert dying makes him King. I am somewhat ambivalent about this. Technically this is true but on the other hand, Robert was usurper. His kingly line is not established and so even though Stannis is Robert's true heir, I don't complitely accept him as rightful king. From my point of view you need to have an established roayl line for that but there's none at the moment. Well, technically there's Dany but her father lost the throne so I don't see her as a rightful heir, either.Also, I do think that to be a king one needs to be RECOGNIZED as a king. It's not enough that one calls himself a king. If so any village idiot could be a king. At the moment Stannis is definitely not recognized as a king by most of the Westeros and so I don't personally consider him being one. And because of this I didn't even consider Renly to be usurper, just another claimant to the throne.But, as said, my personal opinion only.
1053	BeerSlayer	2012-06-01	All I can do is laugh hysterically at many of these posts. Where are all teh people going nuts over the changes from the book in this episode? Oh yeah that's because the man himself wrote it. All this gushing over this episode, "that's how you make an adaption" blah blah blah. If anyone other than GRRm wrote this episode, and I mean word for word the exact same episode, this thread would be full of these posts: "this is an abomination" "thanks for ruining my favorite book" "No san/san kiss/song?" "Tyrion still has a nose?" "this writer just doesn't get ___'s character and motivation" "why add bronn/hound scene, does nothing" "why can;t they make me feel the same thing on a tv show that I did when I read the books" etc... You know it's true, there is no way everyione would be gushing like schoolgirls if GRRM didn't write this episode. 
FWIW, I loved the episode rated it a 9, but I have loved almost all of the episodes. I loved the books as well. I just find the comments about this episode so hypocritical and hilarious. My 2 cents
1054	DurararaFTW	2012-06-01	So...

If Stannis's actions can be justified by "choosing the lesser evil", that same reasoning should apply to Tywin's actions too, right?The Red Wedding did not prevent the shedding of blood.

Practical, maybe, but also dishonourable and dishonest.And I'm sure Stannis would have preferred to do it that way, just as he would have preferred to hang Renly's lords for betraying him. But certain things need to be done or Joffrey reigns forever.Many here say that Stannis would be a good king but I don't really see it. This is not because he has burned people alive or because he assassinated his brother (or at least turned the blind eye when Melisandre did it).

It is even more difficult when a man is seemingly obsessed with duty and does not make compromises.In a more perfect world, I'd agree. But this is Robert's kingdom. It's filled with people that need to be forcibly removed. Installing Robert 2.0 or Aerys 2.0 on the Iron Throne or have Robb win the war then say screw and go back to Winterfell in the throne doews nothing to aid the realm.I am somewhat ambivalent about this. Technically this is true but on the other hand, Robert was usurper. His kingly line is not established and so even though Stannis is Robert's true heir, I don't complitely accept him as rightful king.

And because of this I didn't even consider Renly to be usurper, just another claimant to the throne.But, as said, my personal opinion only.What do you mean his kingly line is not established? All the lords of the seven kingdoms have sworn fealty to him and he's been sworn in by the High Septon as far I know. There's a reason why everyone calling himself king of the seven kingdoms in westeros put Baratheon behind his name. King Robert became King by right of conquest, the crown passes to the next of his line, Joffrey thought it was him, Stannis knew it was him, Renly knew it wasn't him, he went to war to make hmself king by right of conquest, to do that he needsto prevail over Stannis and Joffrey, he didn't, Stannis killed him.I dunno what is so complicated.

Whether you watched the show at Sunday, 9pm or Tuesday 4am (on HBO Go), you are paying for an HBO subscription, which is how they make money.Exactly.  Also, granted it's on Showtime and they have fewer subscribers than HBO (but they are their closest competitor), but The Borgias is considered a hit over there with less than a seventh of GoT's average viewership, and it is not cheap to make either, being a period-drama versus something like Weeds.... but on the other hand, Robert was usurper. His kingly line is not established and so even though Stannis is Robert's true heir, I don't complitely accept him as rightful king...After well over a decade of no Targs in Westeros, their claim is practically non-existent.  They've effectively lost the right to the kingship.Richard the Lionheart remained King of England when he disappeared on his Middle East adventures only because he left his irascible mother Eleanor of Acquitaine, and, even more importantly, William Marshall (largely considered the greatest knight in history and so influential that, after he was gone, his name became the official title of his successors -- Lord Marshal of England) in charge of things.  Otherwise, some enterprising distant cousin with powerful friends would've taken his throne.If Dany reclaims Westeros, it'll be as a conqueror.  None of that will matter if she wins, though.  Just like after Robert's Rebellion, she'll be touted as the "rightful" ruler if she's victorious (but the same people who say that would not be so nice if she was beaten).  We sometimes forget that Robert didn't seize his throne.  Not technically.  Gaining power wasn't the reason for the rebellion.  They rebelled to oust a mad tyrant who had killed both Ned's father and brother and whose son (in their view, at least) had kidnapped Robert's betrothed.  Lord Arryn called-up his banners because King Aerys demanded he send him Ned and Robert's heads; they were his wards and surrogate sons, and so he defied his king and rebelled rather than see them dead.  Robert was crowned only after they'd won and there was no sitting king, because his claim was better than anyone else's, his grandmother having been one of the daughters of King Aegon V -- thus he had royal blood through the female line.

1056	rmholt	2012-06-01	I have recently been rewatching Band of Brothers and The Pacific and it was upsetting. They were so great that they consistently put Blackwater to shame. There is obviously a huge difference in budgets, but why so?!I'm sorry you were upset.  I read the bob book and still couldnt tell the men apart in the series.  perhaps you shouldnt watch if you are upset.  too bad the bob battles lacked water, boats, and wildfire with huge realistic explosions.
1057	rmholt	2012-06-01	After well over a decade of no Targs in Westeros, their claim is practically non-existent.  They've effectively lost the right to the kingship.really? after ruling for 300 years?  Well, crackclaw can be counted on and the lannisters are hashing it so badly - and robert was an indifferent king.  I can see westerosians going right back to targs.

Pycelle was in on the lannister plot s well - too bad no one told jaime.Robert's claim was that he reached the throne that Eddard was holding for him - the king was dead and his heir was dead and everyone else had run or been killed.We have been told the female line targ relationship was an excuse.

My point was that, after such a long time has passed, it's hardly accurate to think of Robert as a usurper.  He's been king for nearly 2 decades; there are children who have been born and are nearing adulthood who only know the Targs from stories.  The point also remains that Robert didn't rebel in order to usurp power; that was a by-product.  Yes, the fact his grandmother was a Targ was used as an excuse to legitimize his crown, but that doesn't change the fact that the rebellion occurred for other reasons, not with the express goal of putting Robert on the throne.  That was decided after.  That whole idea was, essentially, a fantasy cooked-up in Viserys' head.

Pretty much everyone was impressed by last seasonÂ´s "Baelor" episode, or by the "What is dead may never die" one this season. Neither of them was written by Martin. Also, people, even outspoken book purists (like me) have often had loud praise for quite a few deviations from the book. It is the BAD, STUPID AND UTTERLY NEEDLESS changes that we are upset about."HURR DURR you all think I am only a lowly Hollywood writer, but now IÂ´m gonna show you I am an ARTIST too, like Martin! Just following the books is BENEATH me!!! Hold my beer and watch me making a CHANGE just to prove this!!!"I wasnÂ´t too blown away by MartinÂ´s Bronn/Hound scene either, I still donÂ´t know what that was really about.  I guess he wrote it so TyrionÂ´s assassination wouldnÂ´t totally come out of the blue for the viewers. There needed to be some sign of what Cersei was REALLY like, that she first planned to get rid of TyrionÂ´s strong right arm so she would have more control over him by having the Hound execute him in a "brawl".PS regarding the SanSan scene: I am a huge Sandor fan (SanSan not so much) and I am really glad they did the scene in that way. with the lack of attention and screentime Sandor has been getting in the show there would have been no way to do a 1:1 book scene. Almost no previous interaction, no Sansa POV ... it would just have totally freaked out the viewers and branded Sandor as a crazy would be rapist. I can just hear the comments from non-bookreaders "I guess the only reason he didnÂ´t rape her was because he heard footsteps outside" or some such nonsense.IÂ´m glad one of my favourite characters wasnÂ´t ruined that way-

1062	templar7	2012-06-02	The wildfire explosion was amazing. The chain wasn't even necessary.Agreed, not necessary at all. A brilliant job in simplifying the book in that aspect. I would have loved to have seen the chain but it would have required so much screen time in the setup that it had to be scraped. the wildfife scene was stunning. Just like the novel the wildfire literally consumed the ships within range. It didnt just set them ablaze but actually seemed to melt them alltogether. Also, the way the hound reacted to the inferno was well acted and really drove home the point!
1063	templar7	2012-06-02	Hmm... Stannis first to charge the beach and first to climb the ladders putting himself in harm's way. He is trying his hardest to be cannon fodder, is he not?no more than the way Robert and Ned are portrayed in the books. Robert Killed Rhaegar Targaryen on the battle field
1064	templar7	2012-06-02	One thing I just noticed where/when did Tyrion lose his helmet because I recall Pod giving it to him but then he doesn't have it with Mandon...At the 53.33rd minute of episode 9 Tyrion takes off his helm just prior to the ser Mandon moment.

And it did have flamethrowers, many large ships, tanks, etc. Don't be so subjective because I "insulted" Blackwater. The writing was the best of all season. GoT either isn't being given enough money or is using it in dumb/wrong ways, and the Blackwater episode suffered.Samples of The Pacific:http://www.youtube.c...h?v=yqnqLblyNa4http://www.youtube.c...h?v=HlbAl87k06w

Robb's entire camp got butchered, hundreds, if not thousands of people died.But still far fewer suffered than if there would've have been yers of battles as it probably would've gone if Robb would've lived. So Tywin saved thousands lives with Red Wedding and as such, if saving lives is suitable excuse for Stannis, it should be for Tywin, too.Who do you think he did for then?For himself.And I'm sure Stannis would have preferred to do it that way, just as he would have preferred to hang Renly's lords for betraying him. But certain things need to be done or Joffrey reigns forever.As I said, his actions can be seen as practical but that doesn't make them any less dishonourable or disgusting. Same goes with Tywin.In a more perfect world, I'd agree. But this is Robert's kingdom. It's filled with people that need to be forcibly removed. Installing Robert 2.0 or Aerys 2.0 on the Iron Throne or have Robb win the war then say screw and go back to Winterfell in the throne doews nothing to aid the realm.The mere fact that Stannis would not be as bad as a king as Aerys was doesn't meen that he would be a good king. Also, I'm not convinced he would be better king than Robert. Sure, his shortcomings are far different from Robert's but still there are many of them.What do you mean his kingly line is not established? All the lords of the seven kingdoms have sworn fealty to him and he's been sworn in by the High Septon as far I know. There's a reason why everyone calling himself king of the seven kingdoms in westeros put Baratheon behind his name. King Robert became King by right of conquest, the crown passes to the next of his line, Joffrey thought it was him, Stannis knew it was him, Renly knew it wasn't him, he went to war to make hmself king by right of conquest, to do that he needsto prevail over Stannis and Joffrey, he didn't, Stannis killed him.Err... Not all lords have sworn to Stannis - if they had, there would be no war. Unless you mean Robert of course but as seen, it's not enough that lords swore to him. They'd need to swear to Stannis for him to be really a king. At the moment his kingship is disputed and as I said, one cannot be a king if one is not awknoledged as one. What I said about established line I meant somewhat longer dynasty, for example Targaryens. Robert's line is not secure exactly because he was usurper. Once he seized the throne it was obvious that such an act was possible it's his death and not his years as a king that will test true validity and ability of his line. And yeah, Robb for instance does not claim to be a king of Westeros, but if he had succeeded, there would've been no king of Seven kingdoms and so Roberts dynasty as a ruler for whole Westeros would've ended there.
1067	boojam	2012-06-02	I am currently watching The Pacific and the first six episodes at least have definitely NOT put Blackwater to shame. I can barely keep the characters apart, the only two I know by name so far is that Leckie guy and Basilone, and him only because he got the MoH. (I have to admit though the two chicks from episode two are a match for anything GOT has come up with ^ ^)Also, keep in mind that there are still tons of WW II surplus and war materiel (rifles, uniforms, cars, tanks, planes ...) around they could use for the show, that is a LOT cheaper than a show like GOT where EVERYTHING from the shoelaces upwards has to be specially designed and made. Plus, it is all either jungle, indoor studio or ordinary city streets cleared of modern signs.I am not aware that there is THAT much useable WWII gear around still , and that they had to fabricate a lot of gear.That mini series was shot , 10 episodes, 200 million dollar budget, that about 20 million an episode and the invasion of  Peleliu and Okinawa looked like every dollar of it.The Pacific and Band of Brothers seemed near perfect WWII depictions to me.I had no problem following them , I think they were the best mini series duo HBO has ever done.

1069	StannisandDaeny	2012-06-03	Err... Not all lords have sworn to Stannis - if they had, there would be no war.All the more reason they should have sworn to him, the bastards. Even the most disadvantageous peace is better than the most just war, the crime of starting a selfish war does not change the law or grant you legitimacy, on the contrary. The law is there to prevent war, which is the most just cause there is.But still far fewer suffered than if there would've have been yers of battles as it probably would've gone if Robb would've lived. So Tywin saved thousands lives with Red Wedding and as such, if saving lives is suitable excuse for Stannis, it should be for Tywin, too.So you're trying to defend the Red Wedding, good luck with that ^^'You think by putting effin' Ramsay Snow in a position of power in the North is 'saving people'? Another war has already started there because they can't keep their subjects under control, and Tywin knew this. The intent was to have the North exhaust it's strength further from the start. Tywin ordered many senseless massacres for no reason, enough to prove 'preventing more deaths' was never his intent.The comparison Assasination of Renly - Red Wedding is ridiculous for many reasons:- Stannis was right in removing the rebel and usurper Renly, who had no cause to declare himself King and willingly go to war to kill his brother Stannis and all of his bannermen, which he would have. This opposed to Tywin who's starting of the war in the Riverlands was a complete and total overreaction. Ned Stark and his men were murdered for doing the right thing: the North was fighting for a just cause, Tywin was not. And neither was Renly.- The Red Wedding was a complete pointless massacre. Capturing the Starks was a possibility over killing them, which the Red Wedding Alliance ignored out of sheer spite.- We still don't know for sure if Stannis was certain about what was going on with Renly. The show makes it seem so, the books do not offer certainty.- Shadow magic is just another tool, it is no different than shoving a sword through someone or marching on a 2000 man army with 20 000 men of your own and 60 000 in reserve. So the argument 'hurr it's disgusting simply because it's magic' does not float. In the way Jaime Lannister would have said it: 'Would you have felt better if he had been killed in battle, rather than through Shadow Magic?'- Stannis and Robb were both fighting to remove Joffrey and the ridiculous Lannister regime, which, as has been proven, is an extremely crappy regime. They released religious zealots on the land, slaughtered the people of King's Landing in the streets, allowed dwarfs and other people to be killed on the streets, incurred the wrath of the Iron Bank, messed up their alliance with the Tyrells and hold a very weak grip over the Seven Kingdoms, not to mention establishing feuds by crimes such as the Red Wedding that would echo for centuries. Tywin on the other hand was fighting to maintain this regime. In the long run, the victory of Stannis and Robb would have always been better. The North was willing to treat with Renly because he was the most powerful Baratheon at the moment, if Stannis had been holding King's Landing and their enemies lay defeated at their feat, the North would have treated with Stannis as well. Stannis has been shown to be able to listen to good advice. Davos would urge for a treaty, and even Melisandre would, as her POV tells us she is genuinely concerned with stopping the Others, which would be easier if the North and the South stood together.- If Renly hadn't been destroyed, it would have set an awful precedent for further generations. All rebellions we've heard about were always the cause of the rebels thinking they had some right to the throne, through blood or otherwise, but none were as daring as to simply base it on 'I think I'm great and I have the biggest army.' In the long run, Stannis getting the throne and pointing out the law does matter and those defying the rightful king are doomed to fail (as the superstitious Westerosi would believe) would always win out in the 'preventing war and thus deaths' department, whereas Renly getting on the throne would be an encouragement to anyone to start wars. Why was Renly thinking Dorne, the Vale, the Riverlands... would ever accept him as their King? He would have had to conquer these in bloody campaigns as well.Robert's line is not secure exactly because he was usurper.No. Aerys lost his legitimacy as a ruler by senselessly killing off his subjects. Rightful king or not, what Aerys did does not belong to what a king should be allowed to do, on the contrary, it is the King's duty to defend his subjects. His right to rule ended right then and there. That's why the Baratheon claim to the throne is still valid.

Even the most disadvantageous peace is better than the most just war, the crime of starting a selfish war does not change the law or grant you legitimacy, on the contrary. The law is there to prevent war, which is the most just cause there is.If lord would've though that way, Robert would've never become a king. As said, I personally don't think Stannis would've made a good king and seemingly many lords of Westeros agree with me (not to mentions their own personal ambitions for power, of course).So you're trying to defend the Red Wedding, good luck with that ^^'Well, you are defending Stannis â<U+0080><U+0093> a murderer, a kinslayer, a fanatic. However, I am not actually defending Red Wedding because I think it was disgusting and appalling deed. Thing is that I think same way about Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099>s actions. I find it hypocritical that some atrocities can be defended with â<U+0080><U+009C>end justifies the meansâ<U+0080><U+009D> â<U+0080><U+0093>argument and some cannot depending on does one like or dislike the person who committed them.- Stannis was right in removing the rebel and usurper Renly, who had no cause to declare himself King and willingly go to war to kill his brother Stannis and all of his bannermen, which he would have.No, it is NOT right to murder a man and it is especially not right to murder oneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s brother! I simply fail to understand why people are ok with Renlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s murder. So what that he was an â<U+0080><U+009C>usurperâ<U+0080><U+009D>, so what that he was wrong according to inheritance rights in Westeros. Killing a man without trial is a MURDER. Killing oneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s brother is KINSLAYING. Id doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t matter that Stannis didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t kill Renly personally, he ordered/allowed Melisandre to do it and as such he is as accountable as she is.So our Stannis is now practical kinslayer. Good for him.You know, there  was another way to save his soldiers if that was his main motivation. He couldâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve just given up and join Renly. Yes, I know that Stannis is not a man to do so and Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not saying he shouldâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve done so, but it was an option. The fact that he rather killed Renly and that he didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t give damn if â<U+0080><U+009C>thousandsâ<U+0080><U+009D> would die at Blackwater, tell me that he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t care about lives of his men. He just wants to be a king. I really haven't got any vibe from him that he wants to be king to save people or to make the land prosper or anything. He wants to be king because "it's miiiiiine!!"- We still don't know for sure if Stannis was certain about what was going on with Renly. The show makes it seem so, the books do not offer certainty.As said, I talk about Show Stannis. In the last episode he clearly acknowledges that he murdered Renly. And I agree with him.- If Renly hadn't been destroyed, it would have set an awful precedent for further generations. All rebellions we've heard about were always the cause of the rebels thinking they had some right to the throne, through blood or otherwise, but none were as daring as to simply base it on 'I think I'm great and I have the biggest army.' In the long run, Stannis getting the throne and pointing out the law does matter and those defying the rightful king are doomed to fail (as the superstitious Westerosi would believe) would always win out in the 'preventing war and thus deaths' department, whereas Renly getting on the throne would be an encouragement to anyone to start wars. Why was Renly thinking Dorne, the Vale, the Riverlands... would ever accept him as their King? He would have had to conquer these in bloody campaigns as well.Oh but there already has been a precedent â<U+0080><U+0093> itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s called â<U+0080><U+009C>King Robertâ<U+0080><U+009D>. He not only proved there can be a king who is not Targaryen but also that throne can be seized through fighting. And thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s exactly what our kings in Westeros are trying to do now. It doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t matter that rebellion didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t start as a way to destroy Targaryen regime, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the results that count.No. Aerys lost his legitimacy as a ruler by senselessly killing off his subjects. Rightful king or not, what Aerys did does not belong to what a king should be allowed to do, on the contrary, it is the King's duty to defend his subjects. His right to rule ended right then and there. That's why the Baratheon claim to the throne is still valid.I wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t talking about legitimacy or rights. I wrote that Robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s line is not secure which it clearly isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t because as soon as he died, several people started fighting for the crown.
1071	A Bong of Ice and Fire	2012-06-09	For those criticizing Stannis's actions - please!  This IS Stannis in all his red passion, stripped bare of everything except his all-encompassing desire to be King, which is his RIGHT. 
"Ours is the Fury", indeed!  He stayed back and watched his fleet get blown to green hell. Then instead of shrinking in horror and defeat, he took his fate in his own hands and went to TAKE what is HIS. 
It's now perfectly clear why Tywin, Tyrion, Cersei, and Varys truly feared this man. We hadn't seen that before. 
I FELT every moment of Stannis's mad charge and his reluctance to leave alive. Wow. Just wow.
George RR Martin presented us with the essences of who these characters really are in this episode. Truly the best cinema-TV-film experience I've ever had.  The rest of the writers try on their episodes, but really they are hacks in comparison.  
There is only one GRRM. And he made me understand that there is only 1 Stannis, truly.

"Fuck the King"
1073	Castel	2012-06-10	You think by putting effin' Ramsay Snow in a position of power in the North is 'saving people'? Another war has already started there because they can't keep their subjects under control, and Tywin knew this. The intent was to have the North exhaust it's strength further from the start. Tywin ordered many senseless massacres for no reason, enough to prove 'preventing more deaths' was never his intent.I'm pretty sure the Boltons had things in hand before Stannis the Wildcard jumped in. Of course Tywin cares about preventing deaths. Just not across the board, I doubt he gives two fucks what happens to his enemies. And no, I don't think that Tywin ever ordered a single "senseless" massacre.- The Red Wedding was a complete pointless massacre. Capturing the Starks was a possibility over killing them, which the Red Wedding Alliance ignored out of sheer spite.Except that this was always the plan. Cat was to be captured. Capturing Robb is a dangerous game. What if he escaped?  On top of that, unless he dies the North will always have hope. The point is to establish a new regime in Winterfell, that's best done by taking out the current leader. Robb had no value as a chip. Everyone thought that all his heirs were dead and that Sansa was with the Lannisters. What are they going to do? Surely they're not going to trade him. He was a traitor and there was nothing to gain from keeping him alive.- Stannis and Robb were both fighting to remove Joffrey and the ridiculous Lannister regime, which, as has been proven, is an extremely crappy regime. They released religious zealots on the land, slaughtered the people of King's Landing in the streets, allowed dwarfs and other people to be killed on the streets, incurred the wrath of the Iron Bank, messed up their alliance with the Tyrells and hold a very weak grip over the Seven Kingdoms, not to mention establishing feuds by crimes such as the Red Wedding that would echo for centuries. .The things in bold happened after both Stannis and Robb had lost their major battles. The Starks went to war first to free Ned and then for revenge. Stannis went to war for his claim. That's that. Honestly pretending that there's some greater cause here for Robb is strange. He's not trying to put a better person on the Iron Throne, he's doing his best to make it irrelevant and thumb his nose at the concept. This opposed to Tywin who's starting of the war in the Riverlands was a complete and total overreaction. Ned Stark and his men were murdered for doing the right thing: the North was fighting for a just causeAs opposed to Robb going to war because Ned was put in prison by what he knew to be the rightful king at the time based on really questionable evidence?  No, it is NOT right to murder a man and it is especially not right to murder oneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s brother! I simply fail to understand why people are ok with Renlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s murder. So what that he was an â<U+0080><U+009C>usurperâ<U+0080><U+009D>, so what that he was wrong according to inheritance rights in Westeros. Killing a man without trial is a MURDER.

You really think that all kings dealt with their enemies with trials? Renly was planning to kill Stannis and claim his throne, Stannis killed him first. C'est la vie.So our Stannis is now practical kinslayer. Good for him.And so were the Targs when they fought their Blackfyre cousins. Such things happen in war. Why should Renly be spared because he happens to share some common DNA with Stannis?

1075	buckfosto	2012-07-04	Hi everyone, I'm new to the board. Started reading the books on Memorial Day and I'm just about done with SoS now, so I wanted to wait before posting anything. 
I actually liked the emotional beats of Blackwater better on the show than I even did in the book. I thought Dinklage's "I'll lead the charge" under his breath, surprising even himself was really brilliant.  I got chills and I still do when I think about it.  In the book, I didn't feel the same emotion and feel him torn as much. Same with Cersei's speech to Sansa.  I really felt her character.  The Hound was amazing and getting to see the fire through his eyes really brought home his fears.  The way he delivered "the Blackwater's on...fire" was great.  
For epic scale of the battle, the book definitely had it.  But for me, the character moments were even stronger on the show.  I'm really enjoying the ride of both

1077	sagaz	2012-08-22	Sorry I didn't read the whole thread and I don't know if someone said this but I was thinking (and I didn't rewatch, i saw 209 blackwater 3 times when it aired and a rewatch of the whole season in june) that with this episode Martin has given us a Cersei chapter of aCoK.
Cersei wasn't a POV at that point, but she was there.
Because of the show, we can see it through her eyes, as her POV. 
Very clever of GRRM!!
1078	LÂ<U+0092>Age dÂ<U+0092>or	2012-05-28	I feel like I need to make an apology to the producers of the show since till last night I had numerously called them out for modifications that were clearly meant for cutting down on the expenses i.e. dropping the Reeds etc. After watching last night's episode and the amount of work and resources put into it I have to admit that the spending cuts were all worth it as Battle of the Blackwater Bay was as epic as it could get. It was certainly the most important aspect of Season Two for me and I'm so relieved at knowing that they pulled it off beautifully and put on a show for everyone.
1079	Harrad	2012-05-30	The adulation, even hysteria, regarding this episode is like lemmings going over a cliff. There was a nice explosion scene and the acting was at its usual high level. But this was not a cinematic battle scene by any stretch of the imagination. The ships in the harbor were laughable, the "crowd" scenes in the battle before the gate were sparse. The pacing of the battle was unintelligible. To any but a book reader, I imagine the only take-away was that the presumptive winner, Stannis, lost.

If you didn't think that this was amazing film work, then that is fine. I would like to point out that your opinion is in the extreme minority and that the vast majority of fans from both the books and the shows were blown away by it. I haven't read one negative review by a critic, and I am reading over and over again that if the episode would have gone on for another half hour, then it would have been worthy to show at theatres. I also read reviews that call it the best battle on TV ever filmed.So... although you have a right to your dissatisfaction, most of us were extremely happy.
1081	MysticWind	2012-05-30	The battle was as much as high water mark for TV fantasy as the Battle of New Caprica was for TV sci-fi (what with the Galactica jumping into atmosphere to deploy fighters and the death of the Pegasus). Both with exhilarating moments, both heralded by audiences, both hyped as all hell.
Well, at least if Game of Thrones descends into arbitrary mystic nonsense that breaks its own world-building, it won't be the fault of the show's producers.

Blackwater approached that and as a single episode it might even have been better than Exodus. But... the four hour arc of the Battlestar storyline was much better than the lead in to Blackwater.
1083	KC_Accidental	2012-05-30	I think BSG's big scenes dwarfed Blackwater because as good as it was it was essentially 30 men storming a castle.

Obviously it didn't match up to what I imagined in the books. (Smaller engagement, no naval battle, no bridge of ships, etc.)... still, I think you're being too hard.I agree with you that the battle before the gates was sparse.... but considering even big blockbusters also tend to clear things out a bit for close fighting shots, I didn't mind.How was the pacing of the battle unintelligble? The bells ring a warning, troops get ready. The ships roll in. Tyrion makes his wildfire play. Stannis storms the beach, with archers cutting some down. Tyrion orders a sortie through the gates, which is momentarily successful before being soundly beaten. Stannis' troops bring up the battering ram. The Lannisters are being soundly beaten, defeat is imminent. Tyrion leads a Hail Mary sortie through secret exit, which is again momentarily successful before a counterattack from a landing farther down the beach. Day saved by Loras et al.It seemed well paced, to me...

1087	MysticWind	2012-05-30	This episode isn't the best thing ever, but some of the unimpressed responses reminds me of LoTR fans who don't like the movies. The hard to please levels are so immense it's fascinatingly mind-boggling.I measure all TV by the standards set by the Occupation/Precipice/Exodus arc in Battlestar. Blackwater approached that and as a single episode it might even have been better than Exodus. But... the four hour arc of the Battlestar storyline was much better than the lead in to Blackwater.I agree, though comparing four hours against one is a bit like comparing an apple with a watermelon.
1088	Don't_call_me_Ser	2012-05-30	The actual land battle at the gate was a bif naff if honest. It was a 30 on 30 rumble, the battering-ram turtle thing almost exploded when the torch was dropped onto it (seriously, watch it again, it takes light very fast for no real reason). 
Tyrion and his 29 men manage to seemingly go around the outside of the castle and blindside the 30 guys at the front gate (This Ep had a ÂL10mill budget apparently, extras are like ÂL80 a day maybe, why so very few of them?)
The Ep was very good, I really enjoyed it. But some people's reactions is like they saw the modern "Gladiator" for the first time.

It is certainly the most impressive medieval battle ever shot for TV, I would say. I could make all kinds of arguments about "fog of war", and "Stannis DID lose", but I suppose it wouldn't matter to you - You may not be a lemming, but is being a contrarian any better?

1091	Salome Sand Witch	2012-06-06	I must admit, I was very sad about the loss of Tyrion's chain (which I don't think would have cost much of anything budget wise to include).  The loss of that for me really diminished Tyrion's brilliance and strategic thinking, which I think is key to his character (even the "tv" character as opposed to the "book" character agrees on those traits for him).

The loss of that for me really diminished Tyrion's brilliance and strategic thinking, which I think is key to his character (even the "tv" character as opposed to the "book" character agrees on those traits for him).it's not the chain that costs money. it's filming scenes of burning ships snagged on it.they took out a lot of tyrion's strategic moves. sending LF out of the city, taking hold of tommen, the chain as you said, poisoning cersei, the planned jaime escape, getting rid of cersei red cloaks.i'd have liked to see all of that but they really left enough to convince the audience
1093	A Bong of Ice and Fire	2012-06-09	You can count me in the "not very impressed" group as far as how well the battle was done.  Still like the series and the episode a lot.Too bad for you. Because what we saw is as close to artistic perfection as you will ever see. Every line of dialogue, every shot, every facial expression, every piece of music, every sound effect - was perfect. These were GRRM's characters and story as they were meant to be, free from the well-meaning hackery of D&D (may the Seven bless them).
1094	Masamune	2012-07-15	You have the right to your own opinion... If you didn't think that this was amazing film work, then that is fine. I would like to point out that your opinion is in the extreme minority and that the vast majority of fans from both the books and the shows were blown away by it. I haven't read one negative review by a critic, and I am reading over and over again that if the episode would have gone on for another half hour, then it would have been worthy to show at theatres. I also read reviews that call it the best battle on TV ever filmed.So... although you have a right to your dissatisfaction, most of us were extremely happy.This isn't the first post of yours that, instead of actually challenging the poster's argument, simply resorts to cheap argumentum ad populum.For what it's worth I enjoyed the Battle of Blackwater and felt it was the only true highlight of Season 2 but even I concur that the structure of the battle itself was a complete mess.
1095	Michael Snow	2012-07-22	And so he spoke... and so he spoke... that Lord o' Castamere...
How awesome was that? This was easily the best episode of the season, and maybe the best episode of the series itself thus far. It was really that good. I barely know anyone who has read the books, but a lot of my friends watch the show. They loved this episode too, even without all the missing bits us book fans may have noted.
Lannisters have never looked cooler than at the end of this episode.
1096	Whoresbane Umber	2013-02-15	yeah it was proably the best episode
1097	Crow's Eye Kraken	2014-03-05	Despite the smaller size of the battle than was portrayed in the books, Blackwater was still above and beyond in terms of production values. And honestly, as good as I believe the TV show is in bringing George's universe to life, it can't show the entire world from an omniscient point of view. I.e., the Battle of the Blackwater is fought between thousands upon thousands of soldiers on both sides, but clearly thousands can't be shown on this sort of budget. The rest is left to our imagination, knowing that there are thousands of unseen soldiers. And in the end, I'm still just as satisfied, perhaps even more so, than if a Hollywood-budget battle cinematic was churned out.Â
1098	storm.131	2014-06-03	I realise that the changes for the series to the battle as written in the book were most probably due to the budget and logistics, however I think the changes improved on the novel. Â Most notably, Tyrion's use of wildfire in the tv version of the battle, made much more sense without the king's own men being in the thick of battle, as was the case in the novel. Â As others have already said, one of the best ever battle scenes in a tv show.
1099	HouseLark	2012-05-29	I haven't seen any mention of Lancel in all the discussion of Blackwater and I really think he deserves a no since we know that he'll be involved in future. So far he's been a simpering idiot but we saw real development in his character in Blackwater and I think it was important because it provided a marked contrast with Joffrey. I think most of viewers will have bracketed Joffrey and Lancel together as weak hearted individuals and certainly war brought forth the coward in Joffrey. But the way in which Lancel found his courage made Joffrey's cowardice all the more stark.
Once again, Lancel bore out Ned's dictum that a person can only be brave when they are scared. Great work by Eugene Simon.
1100	Arkash	2012-05-29	Speaking of Lancel, I didnt understand what happened with Cersei... did she stab him ?
1101	Zappotack	2012-05-29	Speaking of Lancel, I didnt understand what happened with Cersei... did she stab him ?She hit him at the place where the arrow wound was...
1102	Lyanna Stark	2012-05-29	No, she punches him where he'd already been injured. In the TV series he gets hit by an arrow before he goes to speak to her and she punches him there to make it hurt more. In the books Sansa calls for servants to take care of him and helps him to his feet, too.
I agree that Lancel was really good in this chapter, and that it sets the stage for his split with the rest of the Lannister family and his fervent religiousness. Poor thing. He seemed rather inept at fighting, but really did his best.

1103	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-29	Lancel and Osmund Kettleblack and M-- uh yeah, he was great in this episode. I loved that Martin kept his standing up to Cersei in.
1104	nara	2012-05-29	Someone else has said it in the main thread, but I wish that they'd kept him fighting a little longer to show the courage and skill that he demonstrated in the books.  Lancel is a true Lannister in terms of warrior skills, but is seduced by Cersei, and that's his undoing.
1105	TheEvilKing	2012-05-29	WHERE IS JULANDRO?
I CAST: SUMMON JULANDRO
1106	Greywolf2375	2012-05-29	It was fun to see Lancel as Robert's and Tyrions whipping boy, and a nice change to see him actually be able to stand up in a fight.
Best part though,,,they still don't have him wearing that silly beret hat thing.
1107	TheEvilKing	2012-05-29	No, the best part was when Tyrion told him to tell the King that he's very busy, and he complied with a very serious and straight face.
Lancel confirmed for comedy genius.
1108	Independent George	2012-05-29	No, the best part was when Tyrion told him to tell the King that he's very busy, and he complied with a very serious and straight face.I laughed out loud and woke up the dog. She was considerably less amused than I was."The Hand would like me, to tell you, to tell the King..."
1109	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-29	I like Lancel more and more. He is just the victim of being part of the Lannister-family and falling for Cersei.
1110	Mediumjon Umber	2012-05-29	I concur. Lancel taking the arrow in the armor like a little girl and his two high-pitched screams during the episode is worthy of an emmy.
1111	Reposado	2012-05-29	I agree that Lancel was really good in this chapter, and that it sets the stage for his split with the rest of the Lannister family and his fervent religiousness. Poor thing. He seemed rather inept at fighting, but really did his best.yess, can not wait for this
1112	Chelly	2012-05-29	I got to admit, he was really good this episode. He's very funny to watch and I really gained some respect for him standing up to Cersei.
1113	Husband to Bears	2012-05-29	He had no blood on his sword when he took that arrow!
1114	ServantOnIce	2012-05-29	I liked Lancel standing up to Queen of Mean.  He had a valid point. Cersei only cared about Joffrey surviving (Maggy the Frog's prophesy) and nothing else. Did she have to realize that if they lost the battle Joffrey, Tommen and her were dead as doornails? 
But fear makes us stupid as well as making cowards of us all!  Good episode for Lancel! Also, when Joffrey and he walk out and see the horse scared and folks feeling knowing war was at their gates, all Joffrey's bravado that he spoke of to Sansa disappeared. I bet Joffrey needed a bath after that battle.
1115	It is known.	2012-05-29	He had no blood on his sword when he took that arrow!But he didn't die so we don't have to call the Hound /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
1116	Ferrum Aeternum	2012-05-29	No, the best part was when Tyrion told him to tell the King that he's very busy, and he complied with a very serious and straight face.Lancel confirmed for comedy genius.I've watched the episode 4 times now and LOL'd hard at that bit each time.
1117	It is known.	2012-05-29	This episode actually made me like Lancel /ohmy.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':o' /> I didn't think that was possible!
1118	Silverx2	2012-05-29	I liked lancel a bit more leading up to the episode, i think they did a really good job of fixing him after last season, however in the book wasnt he injured to the point where they were worried he wasnt going to survive? And when jamie visits him after his marriage he looks like a shadow of his former self, because of how weak he looked?
I would have liked to have seen lancel go back out and fight a bit more and maybe get injured again.
1119	Brienne the Beauty	2012-05-29	I liked lancel a bit more leading up to the episode, i think they did a really good job of fixing him after last season, however in the book wasnt he injured to the point where they were worried he wasnt going to survive? And when jamie visits him after his marriage he looks like a shadow of his former self, because of how weak he looked?Maybe his wound gets infected. No antibiotics in Westeros after all.
1120	It is known.	2012-05-29	And he spent his whole time running around delivering messages instead of getting it seen to, might have lost a bit of blood too.
1121	towerofjoy	2012-05-29	I got the impression from the book that his guilt over his incest with Cersei contributed to his difficulties post battle. An arrow in the shoulder would be pretty hard to recover from.
1122	Independent George	2012-05-29	I liked lancel a bit more leading up to the episode, i think they did a really good job of fixing him after last season, however in the book wasnt he injured to the point where they were worried he wasnt going to survive? And when jamie visits him after his marriage he looks like a shadow of his former self, because of how weak he looked?I would have liked to have seen lancel go back out and fight a bit more and maybe get injured again.For dramatic purposes, I agree - it would have been better if he was wounded more visibly (perhaps getting concussed, or cracking a few ribs). However, the arrow did hit him in his sword arm - he can't exactly fight if he can't hold a weapon. Relaying messages is about the only thing left for him.
1123	Lyanna Stark	2012-05-30	For dramatic purposes, I agree - it would have been better if he was wounded more visibly (perhaps getting concussed, or cracking a few ribs). However, the arrow did hit him in his sword arm - he can't exactly fight if he can't hold a weapon. Relaying messages is about the only thing left for him.In the novels it's alluded to that his injury (injuries?) may possibly have made him unable to procreate, which may be one of the reasons he's gone all fervently religious, including wearing a hair shirt. Or maybe he just really didn't fancy Amerei "Gatehouse Ami" Frey.
1124	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-30	Lancel was very good in this episode - comic relief and the voice of reason in Cersei's ear, and horribly mistreated too when she hit him. It's not his fault he was hit by an arrow so I think he's managed to gain some respect from the viewers for his standing up to Cersei as well.
1125	It is known.	2012-05-30	In the novels it's alluded to that his injury (injuries?) may possibly have made him unable to procreate, which may be one of the reasons he's gone all fervently religious, including wearing a hair shirt.

I'll have to do a reread, that's what I love about these books, there's always something i've missed /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
1126	Hear Us Roar	2012-05-31	Yeah he was speaking some sense in this episode, and actually did some fighting.
1127	Maia	2012-06-01	Didn't like how they pussified Lancel, frankly. The funny thing about Lancel in the books is that while he was easily dominated by Cersei and Tyrion, in great part because of his youth and inexperience, he was actually physically brave, like most Lannisters.
And while not a great fighter as Jaime was at his age, or a good general as Tywin ditto, Lancel did very well as a knight and an officer during the Battle of the Blackwater, leading several sorties, fighting on while wounded, coming to Cersei to protest Joff's removal from the walls, etc.
1128	Batman	2012-06-20	Didnt even take out one man! He has the best armor, sword and training that Lannister money can buy! He is smart though, so he probably let some of his blood drip onto his sword, in case he dies of his wound, so that the Hound doesnt come back and....you know.....

1129	Lothar Imbel	2012-06-20	I think Lancel might actually be one of my favorite characters in the TV show.  His scenes last season with Robert were hilarious.
1130	The Ghost of Winter	2012-06-20	When I first watched the show, I kind of thought Lancel was a chick. "Oh that person is way too pretty to be a guy" Lol 
It was amusing that he was Tyrion and Cersei's personal raven during the episode
1131	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-06-20	I think Lancel might actually be one of my favorite characters in the TV show.  His scenes last season with Robert were hilarious.That's because Lancel is hilarious to watch. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
1132	julandro	2012-06-28	WHERE IS JULANDRO?I CAST: SUMMON JULANDROI'm here! lol I have nothing to say. I am very disappointed. The creators could have done a good sex scene. I do not understand because they have not exploited the relationship between Lancel and Cersei.

1134	Janicia	2012-09-13	In the novels it's alluded to that his injury (injuries?) may possibly have made him unable to procreate, which may be one of the reasons he's gone all fervently religious, including wearing a hair shirt. Or maybe he just really didn't fancy Amerei "Gatehouse Ami" Frey.Lancel was so weak from his injury that he wasn't able to do the act.  He wasn't injured in the nether regions, just really sick.
1135	Volantis	2012-10-09	I'm here! lolI have nothing to say. I am very disappointed. The creators could have done a good sex scene. I do not understand because they have not exploited the relationship between Lancel and Cersei.Yeah we saw Lancel naked but not Cersei??
1136	Jon of Norvos	2013-01-11	I liked the way Lancel was played. The only problem I have ( and a few others it seems) is tieing the Lancel in the TV series to the Lancel in my head from the books :A decent knight, with indecent family, remember he is Kevan's son.
A point can be made that Lancel is just copying his father, after all Kevan has always walked in Tywins shadow (who hasnt?) and following the orders or suggestions of Tywins daughter is probably what Lancel views as the best course.
Disclaimer : thats not to say Kevan didnt think for himself, but then he has the advantage of age
1137	Pinkie Baelish	2013-01-11	Lancel: I want to escort him back to battle.
Cersei: Why do I care what you want?
1138	willowbark	2013-02-09	Didn't like how they pussified Lancel, frankly. The funny thing about Lancel in the books is that while he was easily dominated by Cersei and Tyrion, in great part because of his youth and inexperience, he was actually physically brave, like most Lannisters.And while not a great fighter as Jaime was at his age, or a good general as Tywin ditto, Lancel did very well as a knight and an officer during the Battle of the Blackwater, leading several sorties, fighting on while wounded, coming to Cersei to protest Joff's removal from the walls, etc.I also am disappointed about the differences in Lancel from the books and the show, but I am guessing that the creators are trying to tone down some of the others that they consider side characters, to make the big characters stand out more.  I'm not an avid re-reader of the books, but it did seem to me that Lancel was toned down in this, to make Tyrion's going out in battle the big contrast to Joffrey and then the Hound fleeing.  I think it would have been just as effective though, if they did still allow Lancel to have more battle efforts on the show.
1139	Zorn Gottes	2013-08-10	Lancel getting pissed with Cersei and yelling "Now listen to me" was one of the best lines in the episode, almost cathartic /laugh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' />
1140	ServantOnIce	2012-07-05	I know this has been asked about, but did anyone from HBO ever give us a response?

1146	Sambo	2012-05-28	I literally yelled that when he had his moment.
Could anyone tell who the kingsguard member was?  Was it Mandon Moore ala the book or did they change it to Meryn Trant as some have speculated?
I imagine we'll find out next week but, well, I'd like to know now.

A stand up and cheer moment!
1148	Carne	2012-05-28	It was Mandon Moore.
1149	Chelly	2012-05-28	I'm pretty sure it was Mandon Moore. Meryn is a little bit smaller.
I was very excited for Pod's rescuing of Tyrion. It was a wonderful moment and fit nicely with the earlier conversation between Tyrion and Varys.
Varys: Do you trust him.
Tyrion: Oddly I do.
Podrick is so adorable, yet him cutting down Mandon was pretty cool. I can't wait for him to have some lines.
1150	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-28	It was a cool moment, but it's a shame they didn't build Pod's social awkwardness and (apparent) ineptitude up a bit more. He had what, one scene prior to that? What could the book-ignorant audience really gleam from it?
1151	Cheese Pudding	2012-05-28	He was a bit more sociable in the series. Blame the number of episodes. But he was awesome in the episode. I cheered too.

1153	Rhaquentis	2012-05-28	Yes, Pod! He gave them "payne" /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> We will see him more in the future. Hopefully Portman will stick around for the show!

1154	House Snow	2012-05-28	It was probably hard to intoduce Pod in any kind of expositional way, which is pretty important, maybe why he didn't get any screen time.  Having a scene where Tyrion and Pod just talk to character build would be kind of hard to justify, but maybe they could have squeezed him into a Bronn or Varys scene. I also got a little sense that he might have had more to do in the scenes he was in (Janos, Cersei), but that they got edited out.  I sort of remember reading an interview with him where he indicated he had a scen or two wtith Tyrion where they did have interaction.  It would have been nice to have a little more but I think they gave just enough time that it wasn't too badly pulled off.  Who knows maybe a scene in the last episode.

1155	Gannicus	2012-05-28	It was a great moment. And he's a good character, I hope he's still alive.
1156	Samalander	2012-05-29	I sort of remember reading an interview with him where he indicated he had a scen or two wtith Tyrion where they did have interaction.That's next episode.
1157	Bastard of Boston	2012-05-29	When POD speaks, the world listens. Or, more accurately, do not fuck with Pod. You will get fucked up. Just don't.I went back and forth over the show's treatment of Pod up to this point, but hindsight is 20/20, and I think I enjoy the fact that he didn't utter his first line until Sunday...he is the quintessential sleeping giant. Of course, now I want him in all of his awkward stuttering glory going forward. He's one of my favorite characters in the novels, and I'm so looking forward to him being more of a fixture in the King's Landing scenes.
1158	Jolene Brown	2012-05-29	I wish they had cast Pod a little younger... by the time he gets to his Brienne story, I feel like a bit of the effect will be lost.
1159	Clariana	2012-05-29	One wonders whether the series is hinting that Varys played a part in placing him with Tyrion...
1160	StarkWard	2012-05-29	I think Tyrion chose him by himself. He has a preference for odd things. Odd Pod. Feel his Payne.
1161	bayrodney	2012-05-29	I don't think it was ever mentioned to the audience of the relationship in season one of the family name of Ser Rodrik and Jory as both being Cassels.
So do you think the family name of Podrick will ever be mentioned to relate him to Ser Ilyn as both being Payne's?
Back on topic, Podrick was great /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
1162	never trust a bard	2012-05-29	I was afraid they were going to do something different since we hadn't seen much Pod.  I was so pumped to see him standing there with his sword in hand!!!!  Pod to the rescue!
1163	bloocanary	2012-05-29	I literally yelled that when he had his moment.Ditto. My neighbors were probably wondering why someone shrieked "PODRICK MOTHERFUCKING PAYNE AAAWOOOO!" at 1 am, but there you go.
1164	Independent George	2012-05-29	Hurray Pod!!! Podrick. The squire. His. The Hand's. Lord Tyrion.
					
					
							Edited by Independent George, 29 May 2012 - 11:19 AM.
1165	AegonTheUnlikely	2012-05-29	Pod cracks my list of top secondary characters.  His bit with Brienne, later on, is fantastic.  Hopefully they give him a bit more to do next season- I think they ought to be able to work him in as the loyal squire he is; which will contrast nicely with the way Bronn and Shae react to Tyrion's being brought low after the Purple Wedding.
1166	Reposado	2012-05-29	i think they either never reveal his surname or give him a new one. it would be too clunky to reveal how unrelated to ser ilyn he is.
but i do wish they had introduced him earlier, even if he never had lines, he could have been kicking around in the background of tyrion scenes. would have made the moment bigger for non-readers
1167	Silverx2	2012-05-29	Was it pod who tackled the soldier before tyrion got slashed?
1168	Dotini	2013-07-25	What was the weapon used by Pod to slay Ser Mandon Moore?
1169	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-05-27	First off the boat, first up the ladder, kicking all sorts of Lannister ass and the last one to leave.

I wonder what's gonna happen to him now... I hope we get to find out about this on the next episode.
1172	Ser Giant	2012-05-27	So glad he was actually present and fighting, a great change from the book. Makes me love the character even more than I already did.
1173	Stannis4Life	2012-05-27	Stannis, not only the rightful king, but the most deserving king.

1178	Fat Mac	2012-05-27	A little unrealistic that Stannis was first on the ladder- those guys usually die. Either way him cutting that guys skull in half was too epic for words.
1179	Zios	2012-05-27	Now that we know Stannis has balls. Can't wait until he fights the wildlings...I can see it now, Stannis leading the charge himself chanting his own name then jumping on a giants head taking it down himself....
1180	NedFlanderStark	2012-05-27	My non-book-reading-friends that I watch the show with now understand why Stannis is my favorite.  The Iron Throne is his by right.

1183	Ser Hippie	2012-05-27	A little unrealistic that Stannis was first on the ladder- those guys usually die. Either way him cutting that guys skull in half was too epic for words.The defenders there were overwhelmed by his sheer badassery and impeccable grammar.

But jeez stannis if you are going to be first off the boat, first to the wall, and first up the ladder - could you put a freaking helmet on?

1185	fede989	2012-05-27	You know what? If G.R.R.M haven't writhed this episode himself people over here would be crazy about how they ruined Stannis, he would have never lead the charge himself in the books, he was a commander like Tywin, he stayed on the back, etc. But because George did write this episode now the purist can't complain.

1186	Bride of Winter	2012-05-27	this may be the first and last time I applaud the writers for something, but Stannis is just perfect. 
It took me until ADWD for Stannis to be in my top 5 favorite characters (well part of that was due to everybody I loved dying in ASOS, but still) 
but in the show, Stannis was pretty much one of my favorites by 2x01, and this episode cemented it. I'm glad that they showed a side of him we missed in the series.
1187	SerMixalot	2012-05-27	A little unrealistic that Stannis was first on the ladder- those guys usually die. Either way him cutting that guys skull in half was too epic for words.no way, all the stories of the great seiges and sech have the kings, leaders, lords etc being the 1st one over the wall, through the breach etc.  may not be realistic but certainly apropos for GRRMs world
1188	imbs	2012-05-27	You know what? If G.R.R.M haven't writhed this episode himself people over here would be crazy about how they ruined Stannis, he would have never lead the charge himself in the books, he was a commander like Tywin, he stayed on the back, etc. But because George did write this episode now the purist can't complain.I know for one that a thread on another forum (where the posters are not so up to date on this kind of thing) and they are still spouting the same stuff about how hbo are neglecting the books etcetc. Things like stannis' character, tyrion only killing one person, no chain and im sure it will go on *until* someone inevitably points out that G.R.R.M wrote this ep /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />

1190	redditdedditrevolver	2012-05-27	dont need a helmet when  ou have your own personal guy to hold a shield over your headI guess thats true, and since I re watched it bronn and Sandor didnt need helmets... though Sandor is 7 ft tall and bronn's a merc
1191	Affcwasmyfavorite	2012-05-27	I loooved it! I almost had to choke back tears as his men were pulling him away from the fight!
1192	Harrad	2012-05-27	dont need a helmet when  ou have your own personal guy to hold a shield over your headYou don't need a helmet when the audience has to see who you are. Nothing to do with actual battle, everything to do with photogenicity.
1193	Bran Snow	2012-05-27	you know the episode has to be good when it comes down to people having to complain about the lead actors not having helmets.
1194	tsunad	2012-05-27	A little unrealistic that Stannis was first on the ladder- those guys usually die.But in the books, doesn't it mention that during the Greyjoy Rebellion, Stannis was the first one through the castle wall?I thought I remembered that being mentioned by a character.  Admittedly, that was when Robert was King and he was just a commander, but if that's Stannis's personality, it makes sense he'd try to lead the assault on the gates.
1195	Bran Snow	2012-05-27	You don't need a helmet when the audience has to see who you are. Nothing to do with actual battle, everything to do with photogenicity.This is a good point. Its so the audience can see the actors face. Its the same thing when you have a pilot not wearing his mask
1196	Harrad	2012-05-27	I agree that Stannis would make a great king, but I absolutely cannot agree that he is the rightful king. The Targaryen empire built the 7 kingdoms, and my loyalty will always be to Fire and Blood!Don't you all get it? There is no "rightful king." The only defensible society is the democratically elected Wildlings or perhaps the Night's Watch. You don't derive supreme power from some aquatic tart.
1197	Lord Godric	2012-05-27	I was surprised he was the first up the ladder.  Mad props to him. 
Do we ever find out what happened to him in this episode?
1198	LuisDantas	2012-05-27	Seeing Stannis in such evidence only emphasizes how much of a Draco Malfoy he is among much of the fandom.  I wish I knew how GRRM feels about the popularity of the character.
1199	Harrad	2012-05-27	I was surprised he was the first up the ladder.  Mad props to him.Do we ever find out what happened to him in this episode?Yes. He shows up behind the Wildlings months later. If HBO shows how this is done, we will get our money's worth.
1200	Darth Pipes	2012-05-27	Stannis rushing headlong into the battle more than makes up for his inability to give a good war speech.  That is why his men follow him.
1201	Trebla	2012-05-27	But in the books, doesn't it mention that during the Greyjoy Rebellion, Stannis was the first one through the castle wall?I thought I remembered that being mentioned by a character.  Admittedly, that was when Robert was King and he was just a commander, but if that's Stannis's personality, it makes sense he'd try to lead the assault on the gates.Don't think so. He was the fleet admiral and crushed the Iron Fleet at sea.Book Stannis always led from the rear while Robert led from the front. I don't have an issue with the TV change, though.
1202	Tourniquet	2012-05-27	Stannis I support you now and forever! Lets take this city!!!
1203	Triskan	2012-05-27	Yes. He shows up behind the Wildlings months later. If HBO shows how this is done, we will get our money's worth.I wonder if we'll see him before that.  I suspect that we will.  There will have to be some scene of him sulking on Dragonstone reconciled w/ Davos when Davos convinces him that he needs to think about the realm for the sake of the throne rather than vice versa. But he won't have big role in S3, I suspect.  He has a huge role in book 5, so it will be interesting to see how they handle the B4 and B5 split.  Presumably they'll then them together for the show.
1204	Lord Godric	2012-05-27	Seeing Stannis in such evidence only emphasizes how much of a Draco Malfoy he is among much of the fandom.  I wish I knew how GRRM feels about the popularity of the character.I don't think that is true at all.  I don't think Martin writes these books like JK Rowling writes Harry Potter with obvious good guys and bad guys.  Stannis isn't likeable, but he'd make a good king.  That's reason enough to support him, and Martin has always portrayed him in that light.  I don't think he'd be "surprised" that anyone supports Stannis because he doesn't write Stannis as an "evil" character like Malfoy is in Harry Potter.  I think the analogy is horrible, honestly.
1205	Dolorous Nick	2012-05-27	Don't you all get it? There is no "rightful king." The only defensible society is the democratically elected Wildlings or perhaps the Night's Watch. You don't derive supreme power from some aquatic tart.Agreed.  Martin pretty much skewers the whole concept of royalty and birthright in his novels.  Any monarchy is only as good as the man who happens to be sitting his arse on the throne at any given time.  The realm might luck out with a Baelor The Blessed or get fucked over with a Joffrey or Aerys II.  Stannis is one of my personal favorites, but he would have made a terrible king in that he is far more concerned with his own personal honor, glory, and respect than the common good of the realm.  Great general, lousy ruler ala President Ulysses S. Grant.Oh yeah, back to the subject of the thread.  I thought I remember reading in one of the novels that Tywin and Stannis, unlike the reckless Robert Baratheon, tend to lead from the back of the line vs. charging into the fray.  So, while it was pretty badass to see Stannis scramble up the ladder and lop off some heads, it does seem to contradict his book persona.
1206	OzorxOron	2012-05-27	My favourite character of the series, he was amazing this episode.
1207	Feather Crystal	2012-05-27	Very clever "Stannis the Mannis"! You managed to combine "menace" with "the man". Brilliant!
1208	ckal	2012-05-28	ALL HAIL STANNIS!
Stannis became quite possibly my favorite character after ASOS, and is definitely one of my favorites in the show now.
Sheer badass!
1209	YouKnowNothing	2012-05-28	From reading the books I really don't want to like Stannis, but watching the episode tonight really has changed that. /dry.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='<_<' />  At certain points I got chills watching. Oh yes, and the head chopping scene was gnarly. It reminded me that Stannis is a battle veteran.
1210	sagaz	2012-05-28	"But your Grace, hundreds will die!"  "Thousands."The face of Dillane before he says "thousands" was epic!!! I'm searching for the meme right now! (I'd do it if I know how....)

1211	Dragon of Valyria	2012-05-28	Eh. Stannis was behind until his field commander went boom. The situation changed, and unlike Joffrey, Stannis knows how to make men fight for him. Seems to fit quite well. Don't you all get it? There is no "rightful king." The only defensible society is the democratically elected Wildlings or perhaps the Night's Watch. You don't derive supreme power from some aquatic tart. ...and not the Freehold of Volantis, or the other semi-republican Free Cities?And what about fire-breathing winged tarts? /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />

1212	salt	2012-05-28	I'm a big fan of Stannis, but I still would have said that him being the first one up the ladder and being right in the thick of the front line combat was a little over the top- EXCEPT that it balances out some terribly lame non-book stuff from the earlier episodes, namely his 'OH GEE A SON? REALLY MEL FOR TRUE GRUNT MOAN SEX' scene.
1213	The Smiling Eye	2012-05-28	Imagine if Stannis had Melisandre with him? How do you guys think the tide of battle could have been turned?
He was incredibly badass. Seeing him fail to take the city was heart wrenching. Damn Lannister scum!
1214	Hear Us Roar	2012-05-28	I love that they did not keep him on the sidelines
1215	Triskan	2012-05-28	From reading the books I really don't want to like Stannis, but watching the episode tonight really has changed that. /dry.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='<_<' />  At certain points I got chills watching. Oh yes, and the head chopping scene was gnarly. It reminded me that Stannis is a battle veteran.That was my initial reaction in the books too...I didn't really want to like Stannis at first (rooted for Renly in the early-going of CoK), but as time went on he kept listening to Davos, kept keeping a level head, and kept going up against folks I didn't care for.
1216	xythil	2012-05-28	It doesnt bother me because it makes sense...
1217	Lies And Perfidy	2012-05-28	Stannis getting dragged away from the battle by his own men was such a splendid added moment.One realm, one god, one king.
1218	kimo333	2012-05-28	he's always been my favorite king
1219	Harrad	2012-05-28	Eh. Stannis was behind until his field commander went boom. The situation changed, and unlike Joffrey, Stannis knows how to make men fight for him.Seems to fit quite well....and not the Freehold of Volantis, or the other semi-republican Free Cities?And what about fire-breathing winged tarts? /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />Semi-republican as in the rule of the rich? O wait..that's what we have. But seriously how can any of those "kings" have a better claim? Stannis is the rightful heir to a usurper over a conquering foreigner who ruled by right of dragons (i.e. fire-breathing winged tarts). Lets leave out rightful and wrongful. The only distinguishing characteristic is a continuum of "honor" that leads to self-destruction on on end (Ned) and dynasty-destruction on the other (Joff). Who has just the right enough?
1220	tolthar	2012-05-28	I thought this very vividly and subtly illustrated just who stannis is. What martin did was forfeit the idea that Stannis is a rear commander and show us that his sense of honour and righteousness would drive him to recklessley charge into battle in order to attain what he wants. Hence his men having to drag him from the battlements as they are losing. it doesn't really ruin his character. I could very possibly imagine Stannis doing this which is why i liked it.
1221	The  Halfhand	2012-05-28	That was my initial reaction in the books too...I didn't really want to like Stannis at first (rooted for Renly in the early-going of CoK), but as time went on he kept listening to Davos, kept keeping a level head, and kept going up against folks I didn't care for.This. I first started liking Stannis in the books when they went back to Dragonstone and he kept on letting Davos off the hook.
1222	DurararaFTW	2012-05-28	I agree that Stannis would make a great king, but I absolutely cannot agree that he is the rightful king. The Targaryen empire built the 7 kingdoms, and my loyalty will always be to Fire and Blood!They're called the 7 Kingdoms because the Kingdoms were already well and built and had 7 kings long before the Targaryans came along. All Aegon did was conquer them. If Daenerys has right to the throne cause Aegon defeated everyone, then Stannis does because Robert made everyone bend the knee and swear to serve him as well.But in the books, doesn't it mention that during the Greyjoy Rebellion, Stannis was the first one through the castle wall?I thought I remembered that being mentioned by a character.  Admittedly, that was when Robert was King and he was just a commander, but if that's Stannis's personality, it makes sense he'd try to lead the assault on the gates.Thoros of Myr and Jorah were the first ones over the Wall at Pyke, Stannis was busy handing Victarion his ass in naval combat and taking Wyk.
1223	Keep Shelly in Athens	2012-05-28	Stannis wanted that stupid city so badly...it was riveting to see. I think this "throne lusty" Stannis was an improvement over the books because there he was kind of apathetic about ruling, like lawful zombie, just following the rules (that conveniently benefit him, but he never seemed jazzed about it, just bored). He's so much classier when Show Mel's not around to tempt him with bastard sons that he would never legitimize anyway by his own honor code...*ahem*
I worry that they will only have a short time to show Stannis' camp, post-defeat in the next ep, which will most likely be jam packed. The scene I'm dying to see in S3 (4?) is his big epiphany about "protecting my kingdom to win my crown." That line right there has always made me think that GRRM is on Team Stannis (EAT IT, Weiss).

1224	Eggplant Wizard	2012-05-28	Another thing they did really well was Stannis speech before the battle, if you want to call all four words of it a speech. He said something like "let's go get em" ... not the most inspiring words ever spoken. Basically, it reinforced what Renly said: people don't like Stannis. He isn't inspiring. It was such a great character moment.
1225	Independent George	2012-05-28	Stannis kicking ass was a great addition from the book. That was one thing I never got from the books was that he was a great soldier - you heard it but you never saw it.But jeez stannis if you are going to be first off the boat, first to the wall, and first up the ladder - could you put a freaking helmet on?The helmet thing is the same reason why the Night's Watch won't wear hats, and the pilots in BSG had those ridiculous lights inside their visors - it's so viewers can see their faces and react to their emotions. I like realism, but if it's a choice between realism and drama, I think you have to go with drama.It might be a deviation from the books, but we needed to see why people fear Stannis. Until now, all we got was gossip from people; we gradually came to see his inner strength once he was separated from Melisandre, but now we got to see the war leader that even Tywin was wary of.
1226	Stannis is the Mannis	2012-05-28	Good topic title.
Also, I agree. Great episode for Stannis.
1227	Zappotack	2012-05-28	So maybe in ADWD he will march on Winterfell with a war hammer...
not complaining
1228	Stag's Fury	2012-05-28	I would have gladly lay down my life for Stannis. He's actually the only character in the book that I like enough for me to fight for lol.
1229	Dragon of Valyria	2012-05-28	You know, Stannis himself admits that Robert was a stronger warrior than he... if Stannis is this insane, just imagine what Robert at the height of his strength would have been like.
1230	Davos55	2012-05-28	Just a boss all around.
1231	Stag's Fury	2012-05-28	You know, Stannis himself admits that Robert was a stronger warrior than he... if Stannis is this insane, just imagine what Robert at the height of his strength would have been like.There's a reason that Robert can smash Rhaeger's ribs in with his hammer /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
1232	Honey Badger	2012-05-28	I don't like Stannis or Tywin as they'd both be tyrants.  But honestly, Stannis as King with Tywin as Hand would probably be the most potent combination and give everyone the best chance for peace.  They are both heartless badasses.
1233	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	It's even cooler because GRRM wrote it, 'cos now it can't be refuted it came from the writer. There is a quote from Stannis in the books where he says 'Lightbringer didn't serve me better than any other sword on the Blackwater' so yes, he did fight, if not on the battlements then certainly below as his men were retreating. I love how unfazed he was by the wildfire. "Prepare to land." -> great moment, followed by 'hundreds will die my lord!' 'Thousands.' How can you not love this guy? =)ALL HAIL KING STANNIS
1234	Tony Soprano	2012-05-28	He was great! When I saw the preview for the first time, I thought it was stupid to portray him as a hot-headed psycho charging along with the rest of the arrow fodder. But after seeing the episode, I realized he's a great warrior. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />First guy up the ladder, killing a bunch of Lannisters... that was so badass.And at the beginning of the season, I thought Stephane Dillane wasn't such a good choice for Stannis, but after watching him in " Blackwater " , I saw that I was wrong. He's a great actor, perfect for the role. /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' /> HAIL STANNIS! /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />
1235	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	I never disliked Dillane, but the writing for him was sometimes a bit off earlier (not his fault) which had me worried they were gonna cast him like a typical villain. Lines like 'I cannot defeat my brother in the field' (especially how he said it) 'Clean doesn't win wars', how he sends Davos and Melisandre after Renly instead of Cortnay etc. had no real place with King Stannis, but were luckily redeemed by his speech about the Siege of Storm's End. One thing I do hope is that they will mention the Hillmen killed his scouts somewhere, 'cos that was the reason he wasn't prepared for the Lannister / Tyrell horde rather than tactical ineptitude.
1236	Crown	2012-05-28	Stephen Dillane nailed Stannis, wow, what a strong performance: 'COME WITH ME, AND TAKE THIS CITY!'
1237	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-28	Stannis was insanely badass in that battle.
1238	BlackTalon	2012-05-28	I have come to like show Stannis more than book Stannis.
1239	sumpthy	2012-05-28	yeah, Stannis was pretty heroic this episode, I was cheering him on more than anyone...Eh, I got a bit of a villainous vibe from him, especially from the music. You'd have Stannis/Mel's evil sounding theme every time it focused on Stannis and the far more heroic sounding main theme every time the Lannisters were doing anything.
1240	The Monkey	2012-05-28	Eh, I got a bit of a villainous vibe from him, especially from the music. You'd have Stannis/Mel's evil sounding theme every time it focused on Stannis and the far more heroic sounding main theme every time the Lannisters were doing anything.That's why this battle is so good on a narrative level. Our beloved Tyrion, Sansa, Sandor and Bronn are being attacked by the ruthless rebel Stannis. But oh wait, Joffrey and Cersei are on their side too. And Stannis may be a just man, but he deals with black magic and other amoral activities. And both sides see Robb as a traitor. There is no "good guy" here, which makes this battle much more interesting than those between Starks and Lannisters (where it's pretty obvious who the audience will root for).

1241	Lord Reyne	2012-05-28	But in the books, doesn't it mention that during the Greyjoy Rebellion, Stannis was the first one through the castle wall?I thought I remembered that being mentioned by a character.  Admittedly, that was when Robert was King and he was just a commander, but if that's Stannis's personality, it makes sense he'd try to lead the assault on the gates.I thought Jorah Mormont was the first one to breach the walls at Pyke, cant remember where I read that
1242	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	It was Thoros Of Myr. It's mentioned on several occasions, even on the show. Though it could be Ser Jorah was close behind him /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
1243	Gilps	2012-05-28	It was definitely Thoros of Myr who was first through the breach at Pyke. But Jorah Mormont was right behind him. It was for his bravery that day that Jorah was knighted.
1244	BlackTalon	2012-05-28	Yep it was mentioned in the show, when poor Jory talked to jaime while he was standing guard in front of RobertÂ´s chambers.
1245	Castel	2012-05-28	Stephen Dillane nailed Stannis, wow, what a strong performance: 'COME WITH ME, AND TAKE THIS CITY!'Dillane was rough in the beginning, especially his scene with Melisandre in the second episode, but he won me over today. Him folding his cloak neatly and that little shrug of his mouth when he said "Thousands" was just too badass, in the understated way I've come to expect of Stannis. I mean, the guy's an ass, but he's an impressive ass. I'm glad that all that build up and talk of him being a "feared battle commander" was actually justified.Honestly this episode was a tug of war between Tyrion and Stannis to see whose could drag the other across the line with sheer awesomeness. I had no idea who to root for.

1246	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-05-28	Imagine if Stannis had Melisandre with him? How do you guys think the tide of battle could have been turned?I'm quite sure he would have won, in the books as well as in the show.It wouldn't have been an honourable victory as it would have been a result of the dark arts.Even Varys brought this to light this episode, he wasn't worried about the fleets and all Stannis's men, he was worried about the magic.
1247	Dunnii	2012-05-28	So it seems I may be the only person on this forum who still dislikes Stannis. I don't care how badass he is. He:
1. Killed his own brother in a very creepy way.
2. Destroyed statues of gods -- ignoring that others may follow those gods. 
3. He's an insane delusional man -- does he really believe he's some kind of god himself? He's as crazy as Aerys was.
He's a heartless jerk if you ask me. And no amount of going out there first in a battle is going to change that. He has NO guilt/remorse/feelings about sending "thousands" to their deaths? 
He isn't any different than Joffrey who smiles when hearing the screams of men dying in the wildfire.
Call me old-fashioned, but I don't want this series to be totally amoral.
1248	Rockroi	2012-05-28	Holy water cannot help you nowA thousand armies couldn't keep me outI said it in the main thread but as the relationships between the main characters got more and more personal; as they could not- unlike the small folk â<U+0080><U+0093>take refuge under the shelter of ignorance, men like Tyrion and Varys, the Hound and women like Cersei were afraid.  But they were afraid not of something, but of a very specific someone.That someone had to have chops.  He had to make you know that he wasn't fucking around here.  That he was coming and that he would destroy everything between him and his throne.  And either that works and the episode is a success or its not and its just a bunch of swordfights nobody cares about.I don't want your moneyI don't want your crowdSee I have to burnYour kingdom downStannis is the rightful King of Westeroes; in both the books and the show all anyone can say to Stannis is that, well, people just donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t like him and do not â<U+0080><U+009C>wantâ<U+0080><U+009D> him as their King.  But Stannis has said time and time and time again- Want has nothing to do with this. To Stannis- and the character that was forged as this season went along- he has to destroy these false Kings, false gods, false protectors, falseâ<U+0080>¦.hoods (after all, what is a theif if not a hood?).  He does not want their money or the sycophants who praise them.  No.  He wants his Kingdom.Holy water cannot help you nowSee I've had to burn your kingdom downMaybe Varys said it best; the warth that Stannis is capable of is not something anyone whould ever want a part of.  Varys- for reasons known and suspected- cannot have Stannis on the Throne. Because there is no force as fearsome as a truly just man.  AQnd when Varys talks about sorcery and fear, that's all just window dressing- Varys is afraid because what they all deserve is coming for them.  And he's the one with the burning stag on his chest.And no rivers and no lakes, can put the fire outI'm gonna raise the stakes; I'm gonna smoke you outWhen the ships exploded, Stannis remained Stannis.  He didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t grow another personality; he did not retreat, reconsider or capitulate.  No.  No, no.  See, Iron will break before it bends.  And this fucking guy ainâ<U+0080><U+0099>t breaking.  He simply and matter-of-factly called his next play.  Period.And when a man said the fire was dangerous, what did Stannis do?  Did he berate the man (like Robert probably would have)?  Did he vacillate and ponder the dangers of fire (as Renly would have)?  Did he mock the man who raised this concern (as Tywin would have)?  Did he give the man false hope (as Robb probably would have)?  Did he scream at the man for forgetting who he was (as any Greyjoy would have)?  No.He said what was true and kept moving.  Simple and matter-of-fact.  The Imp is out of tricks.  And he was right.  And they followed.See they were there when I woke up this morningI'll be dead before the day is doneHundreds dead? More like Thousands.  And it matters. Not. At. All.  This is war and Stannis is the warlord of Westeroes.  When he got to that boat he KNEW â<U+0080><U+0093> and the show made sure that we knew â<U+0080><U+0093>that Stannis had to get these men into those boats.  He cannot do that from a hill or behind the lines.   No, men- Help me Take This City!  A roar.INSTANTLY Stannis knew what had to be done- no waffling, no hesitation, no mercy, no stopping him.  First one into the boat.  When the men cheered him down the ropes, he had them.  The show finally SHOWED us- as opposed to telling us â<U+0080><U+0093>that Stannis Baratheon may be King, but he is the best soldier in Westeroes.  And he stood on the prow of that boat (EASILY the most underrated shot), flinched his sword in the moonlight as his skiff raced ashore, and dared the world to shoot him.And now all your love will be exorcisedAnd we will find you saying it's to be harmonized.On the beach heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a leader- get his men to the wall!  Stannis is a leader and yes the VAST majority of the time Stannis would lead from the rear.  But this is not those times.  So Stannis adapts.In the books, Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> most underrated virtue is his ability to listen to wise counsel over and above his own prejudices and pride.  Stannis can adapt.  Stannis can evolve.  And so he charges to the beach right into the lion's jaws.  .And he spooks a false King. The reaction from Joff, Sandor and Tyrion was perfect.  Tyrion was afraid and he overcame his fears- the Hound and Joff were afraid and it consumed them.   And they were afraid of this death coming at them and its leader- this implacable force blasting onto their beaches, climbing up their Walls and battering down their doors.  And they fear his determination to destroy them all.And it's an even sumIt's a melodyIt's a battle cryIt's a symphonyAt the Wall, Stannis knows.  A man gets his head caved in a few inches from him- yes, that happens.  LADDERS!  FORM UP!  Like it was nothing; like it was everything.  Stannis commands these same men who moments ago were puking on themselves and shitting at the sight of wildfire.  And now they only have one thing- this man his voice and his plan.  And it works.Again, I believed it because Stannis would do this and so much more to get his crown and toss aside these pretenders.  It is believable even in the shadow of its fantasy.They can keep me alive'Til I tear the walls'Til I slave your heartsUp the latter.  This is clearly unrealistic.  Pretty much the first person up any wall is the first man killed.  Wellâ<U+0080>¦ not today.  Stannis with a  sword in his hand is a beast.  Slick, hard, tough.  As Doc Holliday would probably have said, No, Stannis ainâ<U+0080><U+0099>t no daisy.â<U+0080><U+009D>  He will do whatever it takes, kill who ever he has to, destroy whatever is standing before him to get this day won.  Its as cold as that.And they take your soulsAnd what have we done?Can it be undone?In the evil's heartIn the evil's soulAnd it goes to Hell the only way it could have: with All the West, Highgarden, Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing and many forgotten pots of Aerys Targaryenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s wildfire combining to consume his men on the Blackwater.  So close- he was in the City!As his men fall back, Stannis wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t spooked by some stupid armor or some fairy-tale.  No.  He was enraged that he had come so agonizingly close and it has to be stopped here, by the Lannisters and their bought men, by a dead King's tricks and by all the hate that the world had for him.  A weak pretender sits the Throne and the rightful King has to be dragged kicking and screaming from the battlements to eat his defeat.â<U+0080><U+009C>â<U+0080>¦ and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heartâ<U+0080><U+0099>s shell upon it.â<U+0080><U+009D>  - Herman Melville, Moby Dick (p. 155, Barnes and Noble Classics edition, 1993).That was amazing.  That was what I signed up for.  This Stannis was the Stannis from the books- hard and mean; tried and true; vicious and just; and scary.  Oh so fucking scary.  We finally saw why the world holds Stannis in such high regard, in such high esteem, in such contempt and in such almost paranoid fearfulness.Because they know.  They know they cheated death and made him storm back to his stone to brood.  They know they pulled a fast one on the man everyone agrees is the most dangerous man in the land.For. Now.Before the day is done

1249	Greywolf2375	2012-05-28	I thought Jorah Mormont was the first one to breach the walls at Pyke, cant remember where I read thatThoros of Myr was through with that ridiculous flaming sword of his, then Jorah.For all the epicness of the battle in this episode, the acting is what won it for me.  ShowStannis is not BookStannis, and ShowStannis knocked it out of the park this night.
1250	ViennaGirl	2012-05-28	So was Stannis captured? He has some northern badassery to complete, obv...  I LOVED him in this ep. I liked him anyway, even in the books, but I was ready to enlist in his army last night. But then Tyrion came along, and I was ready to enlist with him, too. What a perfect episode.
1251	sumpthy	2012-05-28	Stannis wasn't captured. That was his own men dragging him off because he refused to retreat.
1252	Lady Octarina	2012-05-28	I loved how they put Stannis there fighting and inspiring everyone and etc, whereas in the book he basically just watches from afar. But after he climbed the walls I was kind of worried about how they would manage to get him away from Lannister hands and back to Dragonstone, Storm's End, or wherever they'll take him. I wonder if he'll try to kill the men who dragged him away.
But I was angry at something: as much as I'm a Stannis fan, I had to root for the Lannisters this time, just like in the book. I blame The Rains of Castamere for that, and Tyrion.
1253	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	I'd just like to point out Stannis did fight off-screen in the series. He later mentions Lightbringer didn't serve him better than any other sword on the Blackwater... He wouldn't have found out if he hadn't used it.So it seems I may be the only person on this forum who still dislikes Stannis. I don't care how badass he is. He: 1. Killed his own brother in a very creepy way. 2. Destroyed statues of gods -- ignoring that others may follow those gods. 3. He's an insane delusional man -- does he really believe he's some kind of god himself? He's as crazy as Aerys was. He's a heartless jerk if you ask me. And no amount of going out there first in a battle is going to change that. He has NO guilt/remorse/feelings about sending "thousands" to their deaths? He isn't any different than Joffrey who smiles when hearing the screams of men dying in the wildfire. Call me old-fashioned, but I don't want this series to be totally amoral.No, you'll still get along great with Luis Dantas, no worries there /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' /> As for killing Renly, Stannis didn't ask to fight Renly, Renly chose to crown himself King full well knowing he would have to kill Stannis to remain King. Killing him was self-defense on Stannis' part. Although he's aware of what's happening in the show, in the books this is unsure as Renly and Cortnay have been switched around. Yeah he destroyed statues of gods... but he did not kill everyone who still believed in those Gods, and, taking the odds into account, his men needed a strong symbol to rally behind. The Red God and the new sigil were that symbol. Even when they're freezing all the way up North his men still clutch onto that belief, and don't desert him. There's a clear distinction between King's men and Queen's men in the books, based on their beliefs. Stannis sees the Red God as a means to an end and clearly doesn't believe he's Azor Ahai or any of that, he's not very pious at all (I always found this awfully clear from the books, like when he refuses the men their burnings in ADwD). So no, he's not as mad as Aerys... As a leader, you can't show shock, you're there as an inspiration to your men, sure you could tell the men the war is going to be all roses and sunshine like Renly would, but Stannis is simply honest with his men: thousands will die. And more of us will die if I lie to you and you're not prepared to face that fact. I'm sure he says that in their best interest, not because he's happy or doesn't care they're dying. After all he has nothing to win by losing men.If you don't want the series to be totally amoral, perhaps you should root for Stannis ^^ He has far better morals than his incestuous enemies, or woman-raping, people-torturing Ramsay, or everyone who benefited from the Red Wedding.

1255	insertname	2012-05-28	"As for killing Renly, Stannis didn't ask to fight Renly, Renly chose to crown himself King full well knowing he would have to kill Stannis to remain King. Killing him was self-defense on Stannis' part."
While Stannis is not as bad as Joffrey, he is no hero either. And claiming that killing Renly is self-defense is just laughable. He killed Renly, his own brother, because he stood in his way of becoming king, and that's the end of it. Stannis isn't cruel, but at the same time he is definitely ruthless and will do anything to achieve his goals.
1256	Howdyphillip	2012-05-28	If you don't want the series to be totally amoral, perhaps you should root for Stannis ^^ He has far better morals than his incestuous enemies, or woman-raping, people-torturing Ramsay, or everyone who benefited from the Red Wedding.If you consider cheating on your wife with a hot red headed sorceress to have magical demon shadow assassins to kill your brother to be good morals, then Stannis has the high ground.If you are like the rest of us, you consider Stannis a complex character with an equal portion of good and evil in him very similar to every other character that GRRM wrote about.
1257	Dunnii	2012-05-28	StannisandDaeny and Rockroi wrote some pretty compelling posts about Stannis.  I understand more why people like Stannis so much. I just never liked the killing of Renly.
Obviously, like everyone else, I love this book series because there is always the unexpected and characters have many shades. BUT.... he is a rather amoral man, I think.

1258	TheEvilKing	2012-05-28	Potential plot hole that has been bugging me: Stannis was on top of the Wall when his soldiers started pulling him away. On one side of the Wall is a Lannister held King's Landing. On the other is Tywin and Loras's army. How exactly does he retreat without getting captured?
But yeah, he was still awesome in this ep.
1259	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	Going by booklore the Bastard of Nightsong led a rearguard charge that allowed more men to retreat and the Lyseni galleys were still held in reserve, it's not that hard to imagine them landing some troops to aid the retreat, or even simply providing some cover fire.claiming that killing Renly is self-defense is just laughable. He killed Renly, his own brother, because he stood in his way of becoming king, and that's the end of it. Stannis isn't cruel, but at the same time he is definitely ruthless and will do anything to achieve his goals.Renly declared war on Stannis. It wasn't the other way around. There was no cause of conflict between them other than Renly deciding he'd make a better King and being all too wiling to send men to their graves, including his own brother, and Stannis can't be expected to just back down simply because it's his brother threatening to kill him.Btw, just a tidbit here, George did in fact at one point say Stannis might be the ONLY hero in the series ^__^If you consider cheating on your wife with a hot red headed sorceress to have magical demon shadow assassins to kill your brother to be good morals, then Stannis has the high ground.If you are like the rest of us, you consider Stannis a complex character with an equal portion of good and evil in him very similar to every other character that GRRM wrote about.First of, we can't be sure Book-Stannis was aware of this.You're right in saying GRRM's characters are grey rather than black or white however, but they're not all the same. Ramsay Snow is obviously far more evil, as are the Freys and the Lannisters. We don't ever see Stannis just killing people for no reason or sending his men to commit atrocities just to subdue his enemies. His character has developed in a way that has made him able to compromise, as his success in striking an alliance with the Mountain Clans shows. In a world full of grey characters, I still tend to root for the best guy among them, not to mention the lawful one.

1260	Harrad	2012-05-28	I would have gladly lay down my life for Stannis. He's actually the only character in the book that I like enough for me to fight for lol.Stannis is in the middle of the "honor" spectrum. He would like to think and his fans would like to think that he is the epitome of honor. Sorry but that was Ned Stark. Can you imagine Ned Stark using the black arts to kill his younger brother to support his own claim, even if it were unassailable? Still Stannis treats Davos and some others honorably and is a brave warrior. A lot of that can be said for Jaime Lannister, for example, who also turns out to be in the middle of the honor spectrum.
1261	Roose Boltons Pet Leech	2012-05-28	Stannis isn't cruel, but at the same time he is definitely ruthless and will do anything to achieve his goals.No. He agonised over Edric Storm, and when Davos made that decision for him, Stannis understood. Stannis isn't Tywin Lannister: he has morals.
1262	Roose Boltons Pet Leech	2012-05-28	Can you imagine Ned Stark using the black arts to kill his younger brother to support his own claim, even if it were unassailable? Kind of a moot point, since Ned would never have found himself in the situation of needing to. I can't imagine Benjen doing a Renly.
1263	Honey Badger	2012-05-28	Still not loving the tactics employed by Stannis, although this episode was fantastic.  Without the chain, Stannis with 200 ships still held the Blackwater.  He lost maybe what, 20 ships?  Big deal.  From there he could contest every position with missile fire.  Tyrion attempting to charge the mud gate from a secret outlet shouldn't have been possible.  Also with numerical superiority, Stannis should have scouted, scouted some more, and scouted again just to be sure.  He had the spare men to prevent Tywin from sneaking a march on him.  
In the books, the chain plus the consistent wildfire launches took out their fleet.  They explained it away with a blunder from Stannis placing an incompetent in-law as the fleet commander, when Stannis should have led the fleet.  That, and not having the Red Witch's Deus Ex Machina birthing factory.  Here, the Onion Knight and his King straight fucked up by not scouting and assessing the situation, which is what the book Davos complained about.  Weird that they become their own worst enemy on the show.
1264	Ser Giant	2012-05-28	Stannis is the the best "Ned Stark" we have left though.
1265	Mediumjon Umber	2012-05-28	This episode clearly showed what "he will break before he bends" means. Even after losing the vanguard of his fleet he is the first to land on the shore. And when Tywin's army arrives to win the day, Stannis has to be pulled to safety by his men. Granted that as an aspiring king and general it's pretty damn stupid to be the first man up the ladders, but I think the show's Stannis is a much likeable character than the book version was at this point.
1266	victim	2012-05-28	Stannis' bravery was not on account of his idiocy but rather of his pride. While what he did may be unbecoming of a King, it was very much in line with the portrait we have been painted of House Baratheon. From all accounts, this is what these guys are like. Robert was just like this. Renly may have been different but even so I don't think he feared his pending battle with Stannis ever. All these men do is assume they will win because of their proud nature; Renly assumed he'd defeat Stannis in the field just as Robert assumed he'd slay his boar. Stannis being the first to climb the battlements is not different. He'd climb a much taller ladder to take his throne if he had to because Baratheon pride get's in the way of all else. Stannis wasn't going to stand idly by and let some "rotten-fruit" sit on his rightful seat, so he charged in head-first with his guns blazing (or perhaps more appropriately, his sword blazing) to bring that evil-little-heathen to justice. After all, it's a fitting thing for a Baratheon man to do. 
Side-note: It's almost fitting that these men who march into combat with a grin on their face don't actually die on the battlefield.
1267	Dunnii	2012-05-28	But, if we are speaking of "morals," I find it interesting that there are such crimes in this world as "kinslayer" and "kingslayer." Stannis, no matter how you justify it, is a kinslayer. Later, one of the priests that supposedly buries "The Hound" talks about how The Hound was haunted by his hatred for his brother. It is surely a sin in Martin's world. I've never quite understood, though, the hatred for Jaime for killing an obviously insane king. Nevertheless, these sins are both talked about at length.
I would venture that Stannis will die for his sin of killing his brother. I guess I keep hoping for some morality as Martin plans out his character's fates. I also think it rather interesting how brothers/brothers and brothers/sisters have big problems in this series. I keep waiting for Jaime to kill Cersei. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
Wow, great post, victim (above)

1268	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	The morals of Westeros have little meaning in such a barbaric and overall wrong society. Brienne's arc shows just this, even from the writer's point of view: she believes Jaime is bad because he's a Kingslayer without applying any logical trail of thought to it. Then, she slowly starts to understand what he did was right. I'm also pretty sure that, had a battle taken place and for instance Loras would have killed Stannis, no one would be calling Renly a kinslayer.

1269	Ser Giant	2012-05-28	When Renly was killed he was enemy of Stannis, not brother. There was no "kinsalying" involved, only the removal of an obstacle/enemy.
I'll never understand why anyone ever liked Renly, he was Robert's spoiled little brother, that's it.
1270	tsunad	2012-05-28	It was Thoros Of Myr. It's mentioned on several occasions, even on the show. Though it could be Ser Jorah was close behind him /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />Thanks.  For some reason, I had Thoros and Stannis confused in my mind.  I'm not sure how that's happened.  /ohmy.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':o' />I checked the books, and during the Rebellion, Stannis took Great Wyk.  (ADwD mentions this in one of Asha's chapters.)  So he couldn't have been at Pyke.
1271	Xanrn	2012-05-28	Renly wasn't exactly planning on taking Stannis alive, so it was kinda Self Defence.
Its not really kinslaying if you kill your kin before they kill you.
Mel wouldn't have made any difference on the Blackwater, unless she was a High Mage of High Thyr. She has never shown enough power to deal with amount of Wildfire.
Not having a fuckwit in command of your navy or some decent tactics would have worked better.
1272	The Smiling Eye	2012-05-28	Stannis is in the middle of the "honor" spectrum. He would like to think and his fans would like to think that he is the epitome of honor.

A lot of that can be said for Jaime Lannister, for example, who also turns out to be in the middle of the honor spectrum.Stannis isn't about honor primarily. He's about justice. Sometimes forsaking a portion of honor in order to exact justice is necessary. Stannis is that.
1273	Eirikr	2012-05-28	I know the song Don't Die With a Clean Sword references Sandor's command (and thus the Lannister side), but to me it's the theme to Stannis and his relentless strength and endurance. I admire unyielding, iron-willed heroes, and Stannis is number one. Nothing would please me more in terms of ASoIaF than Stannis sitting on the Iron Throne, preferably after having executed Theon, Littlefinger, and Daenerys. I wasn't sold on Stephen Dillane as Stannis in the beginning, but this episode settled the matter for me; he was fantastic.
1274	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	I agree except on the killing of Daenerys part: he had a hard time choosing to fight the Targaryens and I hope that will drive him to come to some agreement with her. Fake Aegon however is grindermeat.
1275	Lion of Red	2012-05-28	The portrayal of Stannis in this episode was awesome, whilst it probably wasn't the wisest choice to go first up the ladders it was a pretty badass move and like people have said it suited him.
Up to this I hadn't liked show-stannis that much despite liking book-stannis but this episode changed that.
1276	SerMixalot	2012-05-28	Stannis leading his troops ashore also makes sense from the standpoint that the show removed the land based portion of his forces.  THe only forces he has are on the ships.
1277	LordofWinter	2012-05-28	First off the boat, first up the ladder, kicking all sorts of Lannister ass and the last one to leave.The King Westeros deserves, the King Westeros needs.Pledge your allegiance!yup, i just might have to change my avi' for a stag.

The part that sounds like 'Warrior of Light' represents Stannis and the part that sounds like the main theme represents the Lannisters (well mainly the likeable people on their side).
1279	Lord Godric	2012-05-28	When Renly was killed he was enemy of Stannis, not brother. There was no "kinsalying" involved, only the removal of an obstacle/enemy.I don't buy that.  Especially in the context of the books.  When Davos caught wind of Stannis and Melisandre's plan to kill Renly he told him it was kinslaying and Stannis was too ashamed to respond.  He knew what he was doing.
1280	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	I suppose he should have just allowed Renly to kill him then.

1282	Lord Godric	2012-05-28	I suppose he should have just allowed Renly to kill him then.It is war, but I doubt Renly would have killed Stannis.  Renly seemed to want to work together - but Stannis wouldn't allow that because he was older and had the better claim to the throne.   Also Stannis' methods were questionable.  Killing your brother in war because he lost in one thing.  Killing him using dark magic because you were going to lose is less forgivable.
1283	Harrad	2012-05-28	When Renly was killed he was enemy of Stannis, not brother. There was no "kinsalying" involved, only the removal of an obstacle/enemy.I'll never understand why anyone ever liked Renly, he was Robert's spoiled little brother, that's it.How cornvenient! And when Robert was killed he was just a threat to the Lannisters, no "kingslaying" involved.
1284	DurararaFTW	2012-05-28	Yeah it was kinslaying. Treason mean death, and what Renly did was definitely treason, no matter if Joffrey was Roberts blood or not. Would it have more noble of Stannis if he butchered everybody else but spared Renly solely cause he is his brother. Like they make clear half a hundred times this episode, Stannis was gonna kill Tyrion, Cersei and all the Lannisters too. It wasn't like "I always hated my brother, so I'm gonna kill him." Stannis will kill anyone that betrays the Kingdom. If Tyrion, Varys and Cersei know Stannis well enough to understand this then you can bet your ass Renly did, he knew exactly what he was getting himself into, and he laughed at the prospect.
1285	Ser Giant	2012-05-28	I don't buy that.  Especially in the context of the books.  When Davos caught wind of Stannis and Melisandre's plan to kill Renly he told him it was kinslaying and Stannis was too ashamed to respond.  He knew what he was doing.That was kind of my point. It doesnt matter if Stan knew or not, Renly was not his brother once he decided to call himself heir and king. Renly was only an enemy.The morality of assassination is the only real issue with Renly's death.
1286	Eirikr	2012-05-28	Renly made the conscious decision to betray his older brother and usurp his throne, in violation of both morality and the rule of law. In light of that, Stannis would be entirely justified in ceasing to consider Renly his brother. Renly forfeited the right to kinship, so to speak.
If not for Renly's actions, the houses sworn to House Baratheon would have been united and likely victorious against King Joffrey and the Lannisters. Hence Joffrey, Cercei, Pycelle, and numerous others would be put to justice for their crimes against the Seven Kingdom (and House Stark!), Sansa would be reunited with Robb, and Tywin would most likely be apprenhended or at least prevented from arranging the Red Wedding. Robb would be able to move his host back north towards Winterfell and deal with the Greyjoys & Boltons, and King Stannis would have the resources to truly fortify the Wall & the Nights Watch against the Others.
All in all, I'm pleased that the deceitful Renly died a horrible death. It couldn't have happened soon enough.

1287	MysticWind	2012-05-28	I don't think Stannis is necessarily moral or heroic, but for some reason he gives the vibe off that he'd be a competent administrator. His humorless, no-nonsense attitude contrasts with the depraved Lannisters, the ravenous Greyjoys, the honor-obsessed Starks, and his frivolous foppish brother. Stannis would not be an inspiring monarch, but he'd likely be pragmatic and capable. I think that's why he's saddled with the religious obstacle and a lot of his power base being dependent upon that shady foreign religion- it gives him strength but at the same time makes him a less appealing contender. Otherwise, more people would be able to support him just because he'd bring order to the realm despite his uninspiring, cold and calculating nature.Stannis is in the middle of the "honor" spectrum. He would like to think and his fans would like to think that he is the epitome of honor. Sorry but that was Ned Stark. Can you imagine Ned Stark using the black arts to kill his younger brother to support his own claim, even if it were unassailable? Still Stannis treats Davos and some others honorably and is a brave warrior. A lot of that can be said for Jaime Lannister, for example, who also turns out to be in the middle of the honor spectrum.I think one of the points of this series is that honor in of itself isn't everything. A lot of the "Ned is stupid" meme can be attributed to how pigheaded he is about honor, to the detriment of the greater good, at times. Whether it really would have saved thousands of lives or not, Ned rejecting the argument that assassinating Dany could have prevented a war because "honor" was at stake is an example of this. So Ned is honorable and nice, and loses his head for his troubles.

Whether it really would have saved thousands of lives or not, Ned rejecting the argument that assassinating Dany could have prevented a war because "honor" was at stake is an example of this. So Ned is honorable and nice, and loses his head for his troubles.On the other hand, if Ned Stark hadn't been an honorable man, he wouldn't have inspired his children to such greatness. He wouldn't have inspired the noble actions of the Brotherhood Without Banners, nor inspired numerous other men and women of the North. Without Ned's honorable actions, the houses of the North would likely not hold such a high sense of loyalty to House Stark despite the power of the Boltons, either. One honorable man can inspire countless men and women to greatness for generations. Ned's honor will "echo in eternity", so to speak, as will the honor of Barristan Selmy, Arthur Dayne, and many others.

1289	MysticWind	2012-05-28	Ah, but the point is that there's more than one way to play the game of thrones, and maximizing your honor is only one of them. Stannis doesn't do that, instead his build is more balanced between honor, greater good, badassedness, ruthlessness, and dourness. That's why people like his claim, because he appears to be the only contender who might actually have a post-war strategy to rule the country.
1290	Eirikr	2012-05-28	Stannis is in the middle of the "honor" spectrum. He would like to think and his fans would like to think that he is the epitome of honor. Sorry but that was Ned Stark. Can you imagine Ned Stark using the black arts to kill his younger brother to support his own claim, even if it were unassailable? Still Stannis treats Davos and some others honorably and is a brave warrior. A lot of that can be said for Jaime Lannister, for example, who also turns out to be in the middle of the honor spectrum.I think the key difference is that while Ned Stark was honorable in his dealings with friends and foes alike, Stannis Baratheon is only honorable towards those he believe have earned the right to be treated with honor. That seems very reasonable in my opinion.Jamie can't really be put in the same boat as Stannis I think; he's too treacherous, chaotic and unpredictable by comparison.

1291	Harrad	2012-05-28	I don't think Jamie can be put in the same boat as Stannis; Jamie seems more treacherous and unpredictable, whereas Stannis is very set in his ways, with rigid values.I agree they are not the same. Jaime is more loyal to his family and deadly to all others. Stannis is deadly to all that offend his warped sense of whatever you want to call it. Renley got it right when he said that no one (other than this blog) would support Stannis as King.

1292	DurararaFTW	2012-05-28	As Varys said, it wasn't Ned's honor that killed him and the king. It was his mercy. Stannis may have honor but he is utterly without mercy.

1293	MysticWind	2012-05-28	They wouldn't support Stannis because he's uninspiring and probably would make a better Hand, not because he would be an ineffective or bad king. Stannis, like the Five Good Emperors of the Roman Emperor, would be a dull and decent king obsessed with order and justice, but lacking glory or finery. He's the king that Westeros deserves, but not the one it needs right now.
1294	Eirikr	2012-05-28	I agree they are not the same. Jaime is more loyal to his family and deadly to all others. Stannis is deadly to all that offend his warped sense of whatever you want to call it. Renley got it right when he said that no one (other than this blog) would support Stannis as King.Renly was incorrect, as proven by the fact that thousands supported Stannis as King at the Battle of Blackwater (enough to outnumber King Joffrey's men five to one if I recall correctly), and that thousands of northerners support Stannis as King in ADWD. Furthermore Renly was the one who was disloyal to his family by usurping the rightful heir, and consequently forced Stannis to act accordingly. If Stannis wasn't a loyal family man, he wouldn't have carried out Robert's commands so dutifully despite all the insults. Jamie engaged in incest with his sister, and betrayed her in AFFC, so I don't think he holds up very well on the "family values scale" by comparison.

1295	Songlian	2012-05-28	This thread manages to express my level of fangirlism perfectly.
1296	Harrad	2012-05-28	Renly was incorrect, as proven by the fact that thousands supported Stannis as King at the Battle of Blackwater (enough to outnumber King Joffrey's men five to one if I recall correctly),Except.... All the loyal Renley troops switched to the hated Lannisters just to get back at Stannis. And they were enough with Tywin to boot Stannis out of town.
1297	Ramsay Gimp	2012-05-28	I think another important difference between Ned and Stannis is that Stannis doesn't suffer many illusions. He knows that he is hated by many, he knows how many of his bannermen think and what they will say before they say it, he knows after the Blackwater that his chances aren't that good. But he still chooses to do things his own way, damn the consequences. He isn't surprised by the treachery of others, with the possible exception of Renly because that hits so close to home
1298	Winterfell is Burning	2012-05-28	That's why this battle is so good on a narrative level. Our beloved Tyrion, Sansa, Sandor and Bronn are being attacked by the ruthless rebel Stannis. But oh wait, Joffrey and Cersei are on their side too. And Stannis may be a just man, but he deals with black magic and other amoral activities. And both sides see Robb as a traitor. There is no "good guy" here, which makes this battle much more interesting than those between Starks and Lannisters (where it's pretty obvious who the audience will root for).About the part in bold: he isn't the rebel, the audience knows he is speaking the truth when he says he's Robert's rightful heir. Which, of course, adds another level of ambiguity to it.
1299	salt	2012-05-28	Except.... All the loyal Renley troops switched to the hated Lannisters just to get back at Stannis. And they were enough with Tywin to boot Stannis out of town.Is that why they switched sides during the battle?  It seems like the 80,000 Lannister/Tyrells surprising their flank and slaughtering them from behind might have also provided a small incentive to surrender.No doubt many of the Stormland men wished they were fighting for Renly instead of Stannois, but If they were simply looking for any opportunity to get back at Stannis, they would have just left with the Tyrells rather than ever joining him.
1300	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	It is war, but I doubt Renly would have killed Stannis.  Renly seemed to want to work together - but Stannis wouldn't allow that because he was older and had the better claim to the throne.   Also Stannis' methods were questionable.  Killing your brother in war because he lost in one thing.  Killing him using dark magic because you were going to lose is less forgivable. Renly could have never solidified his 'claim' to the throne as long as Stannis lived. If he had wanted to work together, he had every opportunity to support Stannis, but he didn't. If it had been up to Stannis, Renly wouldn't have rebelled, unfortunately he did. Renly declared war on his brother and put himself in the line of fire. The only ones who should kill are those who are prepared to die. Renly was prepared to kill Stannis, but apparently you would have accepted it if Stannis had fallen in battle as opposed to the actual events. Right, then. The manner of killing is entirely obsolete to me, in fact, Stannis avoided battle. A King's duty is not only to lead, but also to serve his bannermen's best interests: not having to face the rebel Renly in combat with 10 to 1 odds was definitely in their (and the entire realm's) best interests.Except.... All the loyal Renley troops switched to the hated Lannisters just to get back at Stannis.And in that, they were wrong and deluded, just like they were wrong and deluded in fighting the North later. Less influential men take leadership where they can find it out of fear for repercussion. Had it not been for Loras' intervention, the forces Renly left behind would have been recruited by Stannis.
1301	Eirikr	2012-05-28	Except.... All the loyal Renley troops switched to the hated Lannisters just to get back at Stannis. And they were enough with Tywin to boot Stannis out of town.According to the books, the majority of Renly's followers swore allegiance to King Stannis immediately after Renly's death. Ergo, Renly was mistaken in his boisterous claim that nobody would want to support Stannis as King.

1304	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	No one cares if they did. The majority of Renly's forces in Stannis' vicinity joined him, the others would have been recruited as well if they had been close enough, they only needed someone to lead them. As I said regular men will take leadership where they can find it out of fear of immediate repercussion by their nearby leaders. Or do you think the Goldcloaks all fought out of love for Joffrey? So your argument that 'no one wants to follow Stannis' isn't worth jack shit.
Most of the information we get about Stannis is second-hand information from people who have come to dislike him through Robert's reign for... well, what? Because siding with the King, who disliked his brother, was the easy choice, of course. That's the root cause of his tarnished reputation, because when we actually see Stannis, we see he's able to get the Night's Watch's support as well as the mountain tribes', and then people just go and blindly believe everything every character ever says about him rather than looking at the facts... Create your own opinions instead of taking others' for your own.
The point is simple, if you declare war on someone for no reason, you shouldn't whine if that person kills you.

1305	sToNED_CAT	2012-05-28	Well that scene with Stannis leading his men to storm city walls was pretty stupid. He's not just a general, he is a king (claimant) if he dies the whole war is over, I don't think his men would continue fighting for little Shireen. Only incompetent leader would risk the outcome of whole war like that, and Stannis is not incompetent.
1306	ellipse	2012-05-28	Mel wouldn't have made any difference on the Blackwater, unless she was a High Mage of High Thyr. She has never shown enough power to deal with amount of Wildfire.the good thing about having mel around is her ability to see possible threats to her or people around her. they could have been prepared for wildfire and tywin attacking.

And if it had been Tywin Lannister that was around they would have joined him. Who declared war on whom? Renley tried to join forces with Stannis, but the "justice" or was it "honor" or was it "fairness" wouldnt allow Stannis to side with the more popular, albeit younger, man. Neither younger Baratheion, nor the original one was or would be a good king. One of GRRM themes might be, as human history as shown, there are no good kings. They are all despots who deserve to be ousted before they install their idiot children or relatives after them.

When Renly fled King's Landing he didn't know that Joffrey wasn't Robert's trueborn son.  So Stannis suddenly claiming himself king also looks just like someone trying to usurp the throne.  I wouldn't exactly call that someone who just dislikes his family and is trying to stick it to his older brother.
1311	Mad Queen	2012-05-28	This thread manages to express my level of fangirlism perfectly.Yes Yes Yes Yes!Stannis in this episode gave me goosebumps. This is why I watch this show. I cannot say it any better that it has already been said, but I must add my little voice to the chorus.
1312	Lord Godric	2012-05-28	You: "Renley got it right when he said that no one would support Stannis as King."

No one, originally, wanted to support Stannis when they have better alternatives: Renly, Robb, Lannisters.  That is how I interpreted Renly's remarks.  Not that no one would ever support Stannis.  When Renly and Robb are dead Stannis represents the best chance against the Lannister for most of Renly's bannermen so they switch to him. But only as a second choice.  Not many men in the North have, yet, switched over to Stannis' side but when they do it will be to get rid of a common enemy.  Not because Stannis is the man they want to follow.  Which goes back to Renly's point.
1313	Rapsie	2012-05-28	Stannis was utterly brilliant. Can't wait to see more of him!
1314	LaughedHunter	2012-05-28	I loved how they had to drag Stannis away while he was shouting "stand and fight". that was one of the episodes best scenes

Renley tried to join forces with Stannis, but the "justice" or was it "honor" or was it "fairness" wouldnt allow Stannis to side with the more popular, albeit younger, man.Yes, according to justice, honor, fairness, loyalty, and a variety of other virtues that you seem to hold in very low regard, Renly shouldn't have attempted to usurp the throne for himself. He betrayed his older brother, and neglected the rule of law. Renly declared war on Stannis by attempting to unlawfully usurp him. Renly was the instigator. I get the impression that you think popularity should trump both morality and the rule of law, so that anyone who promises enough "bread and circuses" should rule.
1316	Died a Hero	2012-05-28	But in the books, doesn't it mention that during the Greyjoy Rebellion, Stannis was the first one through the castle wall?Thoros of Myr was the 1st through the walls of Pyke. Stannis did smash the Iron Fleet though. Stannis is a battle commander, not a war hero. Robert would have been the first through the wall if he could have been, but not Stannis. Don't get me wrong, I loved this episode (gave it a 10 due to a lack of an 11 button) and if R.R. wants to change the direction of one of his characters for a T.V. gleam, that's fine by me.

1319	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-28	His rallying battlecry was just so quintessentially Stannis too. No long, drawn out speech to inspire the troops, just a simple "COME WITH ME AND TAKE THE CITY!"
1320	Gannicus	2012-05-28	Unbelievable episode, and an unbelievable performance.  I loved how Stannis was the first man a shore, the first man over the wall, and the last man to leave. What a brilliant touch that was.
1321	SerMixalot	2012-05-28	watching this season, one wonders why westeros wouldnt want Stannis to be king (lannisters excepted)
1322	Rockroi	2012-05-28	They wouldn't support Stannis because he's uninspiring and probably would make a better Hand, not because he would be an ineffective or bad king.I don't think this logic jives with the books; its not like Mace Tyrell is saying to anyone, "I like Stannis a lot; I just don't want him for King.  Hand, on the other hand..."  Its not like President v. Vice President where you can see the person in one roll but not the other.There are several reasons why the ruling classs does not want Stannis.  The reason the vast majority of Westeros' ruling class does not want Stannis as King is because the vast majority of Westeroes' ruling class:1. -Wants to rule instead and UNLIKe Robert and Renly and Joff and Tommen they cannot manipulate Stannis.  They cannot make him do anything.2. -Knows Stannis is a brutal man who will desire to bring an end to their own individual shinanigans.  Stannis ain't going to allow the Mountain to go traipsing through the Riverlands; he ain't going to let Lysa Arryn make a weird 5 year old Warden of the East; he ain't going to let Doran Martell send his dumb kid half way around the world.3. -Knows that Stannis seeths with hatred at all of them.  Stannis either a) beat the shit out of them during the war (Highgarden), b )  hates them for showing up late to the war (Frey, Lannister), c) knows youre a bunch of inbreeding freaks (Lannister), d) beat the shit out of you during another Rebellion (Greyjoy) or e) knows your full of shit and will ruin you (Varys).If I were Mace Tyrell I could think of no worse moment in my life than the day Stannis became King.  He would be this implacable monter (to Mace at least).Stannis, like the Five Good Emperors of the Roman Emperor, would be a dull and decent king obsessed with order and justice, but lacking glory or finery. He's the king that Westeros deserves, but not the one it needs right now.I don't know what this means or what its supposed to mean.  Why does the realm not need stability?  Why does it not need order?  Justice? Confidence?  Steadiness?  I think the LASt thing this realm needs is a metioric leader (Renly/Robb) who will not do anything to upset the grand order.  Or a raging psycho (Joff) or a dependant child (Tommen).Stannis is excatly what the realm needs; its just that most of them don't want it.watching this season, one wonders why westeros wouldnt want Stannis to be king (lannisters excepted)As I stated above, there are many reasons but the vast majority are self-serving.

1331	Sorlain	2012-05-29	Arguing about succession in a series, with a central theme of promotion and rise based on merit rather than blood strikes me as a bit pointless. As stated above, Aegon wasn't a lawful king, he just set fire to everyone who would tell him otherwise. The Mad King -was- the rightful king, but his actions showed plainly that he wasn't fit to rule and Robert took over. How many of the kings in the War of the Five Kings had any claim to the throne? Joffrey and Stannis and that's about it, with the former being a spoiled, cruel child in the books and even worse in the show.

I wouldn't exactly call that someone who just dislikes his family and is trying to stick it to his older brother.He rebelled against Joffrey AND Stannis when he went and declared himself King. And he was the first to declare for himself, it's not like he saw Stannis crown himself in spite of Joffrey and then decided to follow the example. That's more what Robb did.That's right. I hold virtues in low regard. The rule of law as in GoT (as irl):1. The golden rule: he who has the gold, rules2.

They were just hanging out at the Vale, being good lawful citizens and then they had a deathsentence on their heads. Even Joffrey was more reasonable then that.You mean because his brother rebelled and usurped the throne fair and square, it goes to Stannis on succession. How about Dany, the heir of the King that Robert unlawfully rebelled against. How about the heirs of the kings that Aegon the Conqueror unlawfully dethroned? Rightful heir? It is too laugh.Again, Aerys declared against Robert, not the other way around, second Dany is not heir of Aerys, they don't do Queens anymore ever since Dance of Dragons and yeah, you can believe in right of conquest or you don't. Either way Dany has no rightful claim to the throne whatsoever. WHEN they sit on the Iron Throne, or conquered most of the Seven Kingdoms, their word is law, until then they can hardly complain that Stannis considers them his enemy.

1337	Brucolac	2012-05-29	After reading the last book, I thought GRRM was drawing some inspiration from George Washington during the American Revolution for Stannis.   The scene of Stannis on the landing boat was a reenactment of the painting 'Crossing the Delaware.' I think Stannis is a character that GGRM has grown fond of and has probably grown in scope and impact since he first brought him into the series.   Having a chance to change his past for the show as compared to the books was probably a perk for Martin.

1338	Raksha the Demon	2012-05-29	Stannis is an intriguing character; but I would not want to live under his rule; he's in thrall to a religious fanatic; burning starving men for cannabilism (with dead bodies, not people they'd killed) or contemplating burning his young nephew for some cranked prophecy, just being a bit too content to burn people alive for a religion in which he may not even believe.  If Stannis became king of Westeros, there would be a war of religions; which the place doesn't need.  I distrust religious fanatics and those who follow them.
1339	Clariana	2012-05-29	I think Stannis is a derivation of "Stalin" or "man of steel", and come to think of it the Stannis of ASoLaF does resemble the Russian dictator in a great many ways personality-wise: determination, fanaticism, the imposition of a rigid adherance to doctrine and certain codes of behaviour, valuing loyalty above all else, plus the slight whiff of hypocrisy...
As a character he certainly grows on you...
1340	BigBucket	2012-05-29	Would it have more noble of Stannis if he butchered everybody else but spared Renly solely cause he is his brother.This is something I can't understand either. Stannis killed the only brother he loved in order to spare thousands of lives. Yet people suggest it would have been more honourable, noble and 'good' if he'd killed thousands so he could spare his brother.  I thought this was a great episode, really well written and really well acted. The scene on Stannis' ship with "Hundreds will die", "Thousands" and the small speech was superb, absolutely my favourite scene of either series so far. The lighting, music and acting from Dillane really gave me goosebumps. There was a nice contrast between Tyrion and Stannis in the speeches as well. Tyrion is completely new to this sort of thing and his speech is somewhat rambling and jokey but he manages to wing it and its still very good. Stannis, the no nonsense leader of men, says exactly what he needs to and no more. "Come with me and take this city!"
1341	Lord Manwoody	2012-05-29	"But your Grace, hundreds will die!"  "Thousands."Loved that line.  I love Stannis in the books and I love him in the show.I thought Varys' reason for not wanting Stannis on the throne was interesting.

1342	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-29	Varys was lying ^^ He's terrified of 'a truly just man' (there's actually a quote of him saying that somewhere) and knows Stannis wanted to do away with him and his corruption. I wonder how, if and when the show is going to let Varys' mask drop and fully reveal his part in Ned's death. They pretty much already have but I think a lot of viewers have already forgotten his little conversation with Illyrio. Stannis is an intriguing character; but I would not want to live under his rule; he's in thrall to a religious fanatic; burning starving men for cannabilism (with dead bodies, not people they'd killed) or contemplating burning his young nephew for some cranked prophecy, just being a bit too content to burn people alive for a religion in which he may not even believe.  If Stannis became king of Westeros, there would be a war of religions; which the place doesn't need.  I distrust religious fanatics and those who follow them.It's a case of keeping your camp from falling into total anarchy really. If you allow cannibalism, before you know it hungry men would be cutting each other's throats just to get a bite - 'cos there's no way the rate of the dying was high enough to feed the entire army. He didn't burn his nephew and accepted Davos' choice, so you can't really hold that against him either. That said I do think it was very unfortunate as well, but then the situation was extremely severe and not something someone had seen coming, as opposed to for instance Ramsay murdering that shepherd for no real reason or Cersei giving innocent people to Qyburn for his experiments. Under equal circumstances, I would always prefer Stannis out of those 3... So far Stannis has managed to bring and keep together a host of believers in the Red God and believers of the 7, the latter being the more dangerous (and useless) in my impression because of the High Sparrow who has an army of zealot lowlifes just swarming out uncontrolled across the countryside doing nothing useful (Jaime even referred to them as 'useless mouths', and I think he's correct in his assessment) and threatening people like Jaime with a club (happens in AFFC) simply because he wants to see his cousin. I don't think Stannis would allow followers of R'hllor to commit such crimes.The Mad King -was- the rightful king, but his actions showed plainly that he wasn't fit to rule and Robert took over. How many of the kings in the War of the Five Kings had any claim to the throne? Joffrey and Stannis and that's about it, with the former being a spoiled, cruel child in the books and even worse in the show.Joffrey had no claim at all. Aerys lost his claim when he failed his task as a King which is protecting his subjects, high and low, he even did the complete opposite. Robert was right in removing him - he was not a good King either but he didn't kill his subjects for sport or out of madness either, so his heir, Stannis, takes over after the Lannisters murdered his brother.

1343	TheEvilKing	2012-05-29	"But Your Grace... the fire... their archers... hundreds will die..."
"Thousands."
*CUE STANNIS THEME MUSIC*
Stannis turns to address his men, as you anticipate a stirring and inspirational speech.
"LET'S TAKE THIS CITY!"
1344	Lyana	2012-05-29	Loved the way Stannis was represented in this episode.
It had a bit of a Hollywood-touch, but it was fine by me. I was glad they finally made him, or perhaps tried to make him more likeable to the viewers.
His determination and his fearless attack were great moments. But the scene that got tears in my eyes (and one of my favourite moments) was him showting: "Stand up and fight! Stand up and fight, damn you!" It was really heartbreaking, but I loved it.
1345	Rockroi	2012-05-29	Arguing about succession in a series, with a central theme of promotion and rise based on merit rather than blood strikes me as a bit pointless.This is not an accurate depiction of the history of Westeroes.  Advancement is rarely based on merit.  In fact advancement based on merit is so rare that it stands out with such striking contrast.  Almost every single lord and lady we have ever encountered in the series got their position based upon being a direct decendent of the previously named lord or lady.  Hereditery is more or less everything in Westeros.As stated above, Aegon wasn't a lawful king, he just set fire to everyone who would tell him otherwise. The Mad King -was- the rightful king, but his actions showed plainly that he wasn't fit to rule and Robert took over.Ughh... yeah but you skipped over the 300 year period in between Aegon I and Aerys II where it was "All Targaryens All the Time."  That's a close to 300 year uninterrupted streak of all Targaryens, one right after the other.  And when there was a "rebellion" or conflict it was always between two (or more) Targaryens.  Hereditery is so paramount to ruling classes that its hardly ever ignored.  Again, the exceptions only stand out because they are so rare.And its not just with the Iron Throne.  Robb Stark is Lord of Winterfell not because he was so amazingly awesome but because he was born first.  Same for all Lannisters, Arryns, Martells etc etc etc.  In the case of the Starks it goes back thousands of years.  Merit has almost nothing to do with that.I am only pointing this out because Stannis' claim is legitimate based upon that 300 years of precedent.  He's the King because his brother died without lawful issue.  Period.  The only reason Joff was King was because the other families ether a) wanted the Kingdom themselves or b ) were petrified of the idea of Stannis as King and Lannisters at war with him.Actually, I'd say Robb has the best "claim", if such a thing can even be said to exist. The Kings of Winter have been of House Stark for 8000 years, a far more ancient royal linage than the Targaryens or Baratheons (or the Greyjoys, I seem to recall that they only because Lord Paramount of the Iron Islands after the conquest).Ended when Torren knelt. Stannis is an intriguing character; but I would not want to live under his rule ... If Stannis became king of Westeros, there would be a war of religions; which the place doesn't need. I distrust religious fanatics and those who follow them.Agreed.  Therefore, its a good thing Stannis is not - in any concievable way -a religious fanatic.  He has in his counsel a red priest.  That's it.  He is no more or less religious than the Lannisters for having the High Septon around.I think Stannis is a derivation of "Stalin" or "man of steel", and come to think of it the Stannis of ASoLaF does resemble the Russian dictator in a great many ways personality-wise: determination, fanaticism, the imposition of a rigid adherance to doctrine and certain codes of behaviour, valuing loyalty above all else, plus the slight whiff of hypocrisy...I am not sure I entirely agree, but the descriptoion of Stannis as a "Man of Steel" is perfectly apt.  I just don't see Stannis being dogmatic or a fanatic.  He does have a ridgid adherence to justice, but that's hardly a doctrine like communism (and to point out, Ned Stark was also a ridgid adherent to a code).  I think Stannis is also not immovable.  As stated several times, he listens to wise counsel.  Stannis also lacks that knee-jerk paranoia that Stalin had that no only cause Stalin to murder thousands of his followes, but to doctor photographs to remove those he had killed from history (ie- removing Trotsky from photos with Lenin).  Stannis is many things but a ccold-blooded murderer is not one of them: case-in-point after the defeat on the Blackwater, one of his lords advises storming the Crack-claw shores and just killing people to show them  that Stannis is still to be feared.  Stannis enthusiastically rejects the plan when Davos shares his insights (insights Stannis obviously had all along).And Stalin's paranoia also extended to himself: when the Germans attacked in 1941 the Russion losses were so staggering that Stalin was certain there would be a coup against him.  When his generals- en masse and unannounced -went to appraise him of the newest rounds of losses, he looked up at them and said, "So, its come to this?"  It took the generals a few hours to figure out what he had meant: he thought tthey had come to arrest him.Now, I agree on the Iron Man attitude and the drivbe.  But not the cult of personality that Stalin bred: fear, paranoia, and arbitrary and caporicious retribution.  That's not Stannis.(quick aside: in those YOUTUBE vids of the movie "Downfall" - where they put in fake sub-titles of Hitler raging against everything in the world- the ones that talk about GAme of Thrones all have Hitler saying "Stannis" when in the movie he says "Stalin."  Intereting).

1346	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-29	Let the audience think Stannis is the bad guy and the Lannisters are on the road to victory right up to Tyrion's crossbow and Qyburn coming into play, muahahaha...
1347	Keep Shelly in Athens	2012-05-29	Stannis is an intriguing character; but I would not want to live under his rule; he's in thrall to a religious fanatic; burning starving men for cannabilism (with dead bodies, not people they'd killed) or contemplating burning his young nephew for some cranked prophecyCranked is right. And it seemed so urgent in Storm, but in ADWD it's on the back burner.
1348	Wjaykusuma	2012-05-29	King Stannis is my god! My favorite character on the books and now on the show.I wonder what's gonna happen to him now... I hope we get to find out about this on the next episode.Stannis is only a man /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
1349	WhiteVeils	2012-05-29	I was a little surprised to see Stannis out front.  It seems like a very vulnerable position.
That said, I was thinking about it.  If Melisandre told Stannis that he would not die in this battle, which is a perfectly reasonable and likely prophecy for her to give him (since, well, he doesn't),  then there is no reason for him /not/ to lead from the front.  His faith would convince him, in fact, that it is better for him to do so, since he is taking the place of some other person who would likely die. Someone has to go first. 
Just an interesting thought.
1350	BigBucket	2012-05-29	Yeah I was a bit surprised, I don't think a King would ever have actually gone in with the wall fodder but it made for great t.v. It also works well with who Stannis is and helps to show that. He's an experienced, resolute bastard and when the shit hits the fan he's the first one in the boat shouting "Follow me!" Contrast that with Joff who looks like he's never been happier to follow one of his mothers commands and get his arse out of there.
1351	Harrad	2012-05-29	Stannis was never in a dangerous position during the battle since he is a main character who lives through at least 3 more books. And he is not a "resolute bastard." If he were a bastard he would probably put himself on the death list.
1352	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-29	In medieval times it was common for poorer lords with fewer men at their command to fight. Kings would also fight if the situation was dire, and it was dire, seeing as his field commander had just been taken out. There's always a chance an arrow will hit you, but that chance is always small. It wasn't like he was running 3 metres ahead of everyone. As for going up the ladder first, the wall was hit where the defences were weakest - you could easily see there wasn't space on the battlements for a large number of men to await the defenders, there wasn't even enough space to get a good surround. He faced 2 vs. 1 odds at most and Stannis, as almost any man trained from childhood to be a knight and then a lord would be, is going to be more skilled than random militia / men-at-arms. It would've been a different story if he had happily been cutting away armour-plastered heavy knights, but I don't think this was as unrealistic as people are making it out to be. The fighting was in fact very realistic, I've mentioned it before but I'll say it again: the choreographer did an amazing job getting the actors to display medieval techniques. Caesar and Alexander the Great would be other examples of real-life commanders who also fought.
In the end I can just bring it down to this: Stannis is a BAMF and haters gonna hate.

1353	MysticWind	2012-05-30	Stannis is an intriguing character; but I would not want to live under his rule; he's in thrall to a religious fanatic; burning starving men for cannabilism (with dead bodies, not people they'd killed) or contemplating burning his young nephew for some cranked prophecy, just being a bit too content to burn people alive for a religion in which he may not even believe.  If Stannis became king of Westeros, there would be a war of religions; which the place doesn't need.  I distrust religious fanatics and those who follow them.  I disagree- religion in Westeros is much more anemic compared to that of medieval Europe. Oh sure the Faith of the Seven might have some militant orders, but overall their church (temple?) organization seems to be far more politically weak than that of the Papacy during the Middle Ages. Far less influential. And there are people believing all sorts of different religions (the old gods, the Drowned God) with minimal religious friction.I don't know what this means or what its supposed to mean.  Why does the realm not need stability?  Why does it not need order?  Justice? Confidence?  Steadiness?  I think the LASt thing this realm needs is a metioric leader (Renly/Robb) who will not do anything to upset the grand order.  Or a raging psycho (Joff) or a dependant child (Tommen).Stannis is excatly what the realm needs; its just that most of them don't want it.I'm being pithy and quoting from The Dark Knight. Of course Stannis should be the king, he's depicted as a dour man who does what needs to be done for the greater good (as I both said before and say below), and he has the best claim to the throne. Ned Stark freaking endorsed him. But my point is that he's unlikely to get his chance at Marcus Aurelius because the Westerosi are a bunch of heroic and villainous twits who will kill each other first and lay waste to their own continent while sinister invaders creep outside, because dammit that's what heroes and villains do, instead of rallying around a boring and fairly sexless guy who otherwise might make a decent king who could protect the realm from White Walkers and dragons.(And of course, Stannis isn't perfect, his power base is built upon a foreign cult with their own sinister designs and capabilities. That's one of the things that makes the series balanced- if Stannis wasn't so dependent upon Melisandre and a spooky sect, he'd be the natural choice for everyone reading the series to support, Robb Stark's naive northern warrior heroism be damned.)I'm surprised that no one is disagreeing my main points about Stannis probably being the only decent contender for a ruler of Westeros. He really comes across to me as an uninspiring man who is willing to do his duty, and so would probably do a decent king who doesn't get wrapped up in depravity, honor, or violence. Anyone disagree?As for the Stalin post, I interestingly view Stannis as another Kerensky- a figure who was legitimate and a moderate, but unfortunately was impotent against the greater passions of radicals, and ended up being lost in the tide of history.

1354	sToNED_CAT	2012-05-30	To be a king you need to be also a good diplomat and able to make friends not enemies. ESPECIALLY in Westeros where kings seem to be completely depending on their grand vassals (royal demesne being so small and weak on it's own) Stannis lacks even the basics of diplomacy, he's too inflexible and I think if he became a king he would end up like Aerys - eventually he would piss off some of his vassals enough, so they would revolt.
1355	DurararaFTW	2012-05-30	See I think Westeros needs to have Stannis ruling it for a while, just someone that'll throw everyone that's not doing their job on the fire. It won't be pretty but after Robert it needs some discipline.
1356	sToNED_CAT	2012-05-30	Caesar and Alexander the Great would be other examples of real-life commanders who also fought.Caesar fought sometimes, yes, but I don't think he fought in front ranks during sieges... That's incredibly dangerous, far more than doing it in open battle. On battlefield commander has some control over situation, he is not as easily visible to enemy missile troops and stones thrown from the walls or boiling oil are far more dangerous for armoured man than swords. I don't exactly remember the book where I read it (maybe something written by Machiavelli or Vegetius?), but the book stated that while it is sometimes advantageous for general to lead his troops  in battle, he should NEVER be the first one when attacking the walls.I think of all famous commanders only Alexander did it regulary and the results: arrow in chest, broken arm, heavy concussion, while he was never wounded during regular battle despite the fact that he liked to lead the charge and was involved in lot of swordfights. Obviously sieges are much more dangerous for commanders.

That's how his brother became King and that's where Stannis' "right" devolves from. Ask Dany if Stannis is justified in being King rather than her. Since Stannis doesn't seem to grasp that fact, if he became King, there are any other number of facts he is likely to miss in the same way.Would he be a good ruler? No. He is a dull, unimaginative plodder with a little-brother persecution complex. He is a mediocre general who thus far in GoT HBO is 0-1 on the battlefiled and 1-0 in murdering his rival to avoid a battle. He would be as bad a King as Robert for the opposite reason. Instituting his Robespierre-like Tyranny of Virtue after he became King, would result in dissent and rebellion leading to a quick change of regime, such as Napoleon after the French revolution. I suspect GRRM feels the same way about Stannis as will be evident in upcoming books.

Though I guess the point is that in Westeros, being an even grittier analogue to medieval Europe, justice is just as devalued and relative and really just as worthless in protecting the common good.He still seems like the only contender who might actually carry out the necessary motions of statecraft instead of just maintaing his own glory and power, unlike the others. Well, and Robb. But Stannis is likely a more seasoned administrator than Robb.I also view him as one of the few leaders who is willing to do the dirty jobs and take up the unappealing duties that others shirk.To be a king you need to be also a good diplomat and able to make friends not enemies. ESPECIALLY in Westeros where kings seem to be completely depending on their grand vassals (royal demesne being so small and weak on it's own) Stannis lacks even the basics of diplomacy, he's too inflexible and I think if he became a king he would end up like Aerys - eventually he would piss off some of his vassals enough, so they would revolt.Yeah, Stannis seems he'd probably fit in better as the head of state of a classical centralized empire such as that of imperial Rome or China, where power of the central authority is more assured (depending on the era) than in feudal states.

1360	greywindsrage	2012-05-30	I thought this very vividly and subtly illustrated just who stannis is. What martin did was forfeit the idea that Stannis is a rear commander and show us that his sense of honour and righteousness would drive him to recklessley charge into battle in order to attain what he wants. Hence his men having to drag him from the battlements as they are losing. it doesn't really ruin his character. I could very possibly imagine Stannis doing this which is why i liked it.Well put. After he saw the Imps little trick he realised that the only way to get his men to overcome their sudden fear was to lead the charge. GRRM does a great job in showing the difference between him and Joffrey. Stannis' men witness the wildfire explosion only to see their leader shrug it off. That is inspiring enough. The Lannister soldiers saw their "King" leave them when they needed his presence the most and it took Tyrion's insirational speech and bravery to get them to defend the gates. It makes Jofferys arrogant boasting  all the more hilarious, "A King doesn't speak of battle plans with stupid girls" DWL!
1361	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	Stannis has the right to be the next King in the same way that anyone in Westeros has the right. If he beats all the rivals he will be King. That's how his brother became King and that's where Stannis' "right" devolves from. Ask Dany if Stannis is justified in being King rather than her. Since Stannis doesn't seem to grasp that fact, if he became King, there are any other number of facts he is likely to miss in the same way.It's not a question of becoming King. Stannis is King. Aerys was rightfully removed for his crimes that made him lose his legitimacy as a ruler, opening the way for a new regime. Robert wasn't a great King, but neither did he commit crimes against his bannermen or smallfolk, so he held on to his legitimacy. The Lannisters murdered Robert, murdered countless children and smallfolk, and denied the most sacred law in Westeros, that of the guest right. So far they've been horrible rulers with a very weak grip on the land - Dorne wants them dead, the Riverlands are contested and want them dead (except for the Freys), the Vale is in turmoil and there's nothing they can do about it, their grip on the North relies on a fake girl and is heavily contested, they are allowing the Night's Watch to simply die out and they incurred the wrath of the Iron Bank and their own relations with the Tyrells are vA©ry difficult as well. They've allowed religious zealots that contribute nothing to society to spread out over the lands and become a dangerous force once more. They don't even base their 'claim' on their military, they invoke the law by saying Tommen is the true King. Which he's not. By saying they honour the law, they become subjects to the law, and thus on a level of law submit to Stannis. They have zero basis for a claim. Zero. And they're making it so almost the entire realm has reasons to carry grudges against them, grudges that could lead to further war, while with Stannis, people just carry a general dislike for him that is the result of people being influenced by his (true) brother's (who hated him) opinion rather than cold hard facts, because there was not one reason for people to dislike Stannis as much as they do even before the series began. Not one. And you tell me Stannis would be a worse ruler and doesn't deserve the crown on the sole basis that he simply hasn't been given the opportunity to prove himself yet? Really? *Really?* Daenerys has not yet come into play or declared herself Queen, so it's logical Stannis doesn't consider her right now.He is a mediocre general who thus far in GoT HBO is 0-1 on the battlefiled and 1-0 in murdering his rival to avoid a battle.He's not a mediocre general. He is one of the best in Westeros. Just take a brief look at his military career: 1) Held Storm's End - this shows knowledge of defensive siege tactics and the ability to keep your men disciplined, which is extremely important to any general. 2) Conquered Dragonstone - shows his knowledge of offensive siege tactics 3) Crushed the Iron Fleet - he's a good naval commander, as well! 4) Was very close to taking King's Landing but on the verge of victory was defeated on the Blackwater, like any commander would have if your second-in-command fucks up, your men abandon you and a 80 000 men horde descends out of nowhere to attack your split, outnumbered host (or is it Stannis' fault his scouts were killed by the mountain tribes too? I don't think so) 5) Sprung the ideal ambush attack on the Wildlings on unfamiliar ground. 6) Chased the Ironmen out of Deepmotte Dyke and hunted them down on unfamiliar ground, denying them escape.Which commander in Westeros can put forth such results? He is right up there with his (true) brother, Robb and Randyll Tarly among the best commanders in Westeros, with the added bonus that he's proven himself in all different sorts of fights rather than just land battles. Stop your hating because it's becoming more ridiculous with every single thing you say. If you can't even admit he's a good commander you're clearly just speaking bullshit 'cos you hate him ^__^I suspect GRRM feels the same way about Stannis as will be evident in upcoming books.No, that's just what you are hoping. It seems more likely to me, that the people will begin to realize Stannis might not be that bad after all the shit the Lannisters have done. Though they're more likely to support fake Aegon. Stannis would be a good King because he, unlike Robert, is not stupid enough to discard good advice or to allow corruption.

Defending such castle as Storm's End is really not that difficult, just don't starve and keep the discipline.2. Conquering the Dragonstone wasn't too impressive feat. After all Targs were completely defeated, there had just very few soldiers. And I'm not even sure he had to fight - I think Vis and Dany simply fled and rest surrendered.3. Crushed the Iron Fleet fine. BUt I always got the impression that despite Ironmen considerable experience on sea, they simply are no match for whole Westerosi royal fleet (not to mention Westeros armies).4. Actually the bad scouting WAS his fault, it is always commander prime responsibility to cover his back. You don't get reports from your scouts you send more scouts. Plus the battle seemed too rushed and reckless for me - too many dead even if he won. He should have used his feet to disembark his soldiers further north on the coast and attack the city from that direcion, no need to cross the river under enemy fire.5. and 6. were just minor batles and he always had an advantage (against Wildlings in discipline and Melisandre and Ashas Ironmen were far less numerous).

1363	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	Defending Storm's End was difficult - he was facing dissension and greater numbers. I'm pretty sure you and me wouldn't want to have been in his shoes.From the gift chapter of the winds of winter we can conclude Stannis did have to conquer Dragonstone.The Ironmen crushed the Tyrells in AFFC, and crushed the Lannisters at their own port so that argument doesn't fly either. They live and die on the sea and are pretty much the gods of the sea, Stannis' victory over them was no doubt his greatest victory.It was the only way to deploy his entire force at the same spot and most likely get siege equipment across, plus he chose to attack the city where it was the weakest which is always the best choice. Reasonably he had more reason to suspect any possible Lannister reinforcements would appear from up there because no one had reason to suspect the Tyrells and Lannisters would strike a deal. It was Imry Florent who failed, not Stannis. The scouting is not his fault - he put scouts there to warn him (what more should he do?), they just failed in their mission. Despite all this and most of his men abandoning him, Stannis had the Lyseni galleys and a charge from the rearguard by the Bastard of Nightsong ready as his final cards to play which allowed him to avoid capture and escape with those who remained loyal to him and would fit on the boats. Only a smart commander keeps such things in reserve.Against the Wildlings he was greatly outnumbered and faced giants and mammoths. It's not just that he won, it's how he won, and that's with very little apparent casualties, on unfamiliar ground, fighting the enemy on their own ground, in circumstances (cold, snow) that were unknown to his army. He sprung the ambush perfectly and say what you want about Mance, but Mance is not a man who is easily surprised - his camp was guarded for an attack against Others of all things, the most sneaky bastards in the series with camouflage armour, yet Stannis' host took him completely by surprise.The Ironmen were outnumbered, but an incompetent or 'mediocre' commander would have easily allowed them to escape, especially seeing as he was fighting on unfamiliar ground. Again it's not a question of 'whether' he won, it's a question of 'how' he won - the Ironmen were tricked into a false sense of security and were completely surrounded before the trap was sprung, so none of them got away. Perfectly executed is what I'd call that, instead you use the word 'mediocre.'If he's that mediocre, I don't see any reason for Tywin to see him as their most feared enemy when he has only a small host at his command, yet he does. Are you suggesting that not only Stannis is a mediocre commander, but Tywin is a fool and a bad judge of character / skill as well?

1364	HouseLark	2012-05-31	I was a little surprised to see Stannis out front.  It seems like a very vulnerable position.For everyone who is surprised by this I ask why? It's normal for kings and highlords in our history to stay back in a position of command but in Westeros the leaders were often at the front of the battle. Robert was on the Trident along with Rhaegar. Robert was also the first over the wall when Pyke was taken during the Greyjoy rebellion while Ned was always said to lead from the front. Robb is always in the think of things and even Aegon the Conquerer got involved in the fighting (admittedly from the back of his dragon!). It's just not that weird in Westeros for leaders to head the battle charge.
1365	DurararaFTW	2012-05-31	2. Conquering the Dragonstone wasn't too impressive feat. After all Targs were completely defeated, there had just very few soldiers. And I'm not even sure he had to fight - I think Vis and Dany simply fled and rest surrendered.3. Crushed the Iron Fleet fine. BUt I always got the impression that despite Ironmen considerable experience on sea, they simply are no match for whole Westerosi royal fleet (not to mention Westeros armies).The contradiction is just baffling. Stannis had to defeat the royal fleet to conquer dragonstone. You think the royal fleet fought at Summerhall, or Ashford, or Stoney Sept or the Trident?4. Actually the bad scouting WAS his fault, it is always commander prime responsibility to cover his back. You don't get reports from your scouts you send more scouts. Plus the battle seemed too rushed and reckless for me - too many dead even if he won. He should have used his feet to disembark his soldiers further north on the coast and attack the city from that direcion, no need to cross the river under enemy fire.Further scouting means delaying more, like Renly did who had 100,000 men and took about as many days to march on King's Landing and ended up accomplishing nothing at all because surprise! Someone struck against him first. He knew that King's Landing was vulnerable and he was right. If the Tyrells picked the Lannisters to side with or Tywin decided to reinforce King's Landings garrison, that weakness would be gone. Therefore city had to be taken BEFORE then. He had window of opportunity to strike in, thanks to Littlefiner and Edmure it closed sooner then expected.5. and 6. were just minor batles and he always had an advantage (against Wildlings in discipline and Melisandre and Ashas Ironmen were far less numerous).The wildings had a 20 to 1 numerical advantage, and giants and mammoths. And all Renly bannermen had deserted him.If the troops of Dragonstone or the royal fleet under Roberts rule are so disciplined that no matter the numerical disadvantage it's still an unfair fight in their favor then that's a credit to Stannis. Not anyone else. He's the master of ships and Lord of Dragonstone.

1367	Ser Giant	2012-05-31	Ha! Love that movie/album. You need to add a couple lines about how he'll eat your pets, correct your grammar, loves dogs, will slice the top of your head off, has a flaming heart with a STAG on his effing chest, etc. But it's a good start.
1368	Lady of Long Lake	2012-05-31	You know what? If G.R.R.M haven't writhed this episode himself people over here would be crazy about how they ruined Stannis, he would have never lead the charge himself in the books, he was a commander like Tywin, he stayed on the back, etc. But because George did write this episode now the purist can't complain.That's what makes this utterly amazing! We've never had a spotlight view on Stannis because he doesn't have a POV in the books. This is George's unique chance to show us new facets to their personalities- things we haven't learned before in the books. We got to see Stannis fleshed out more as a character and I am so darn impressed! I see glimpses of Robert In Stannis now and that's the first time I've seen ANY similarity between those two Baratheon brothers.
1369	MadMage	2012-05-31	While Stannis leading the boats to shore and being the first to land didn't surprise me, leading the charge and climbing the battlements did. Following his characterization and more importantly how others in the books describe him, I foresaw something more along the lines of him staying at shore and directing his troops with maybe a soldier carrying a tower shield to protect him. To show Stannis' badassery, they could've gone the route of him  not even so much as flinching while arrows fell around him and maybe throw in a duel or Tyrion's rear attack being split off and charging at him so he could get a few swordplay scenes.
In the books, they described Robert as being foolhardy to be the first to often storm the ramparts while Stannis was the more patient commander.
1370	StannisandDaeny	2012-06-01	It was out of necessity: the battle scene is different here and his men were really scared because of the wildifre, the geographical changes also made it so he was immediately on the side of the battle rather than isolated from the attacking force with the Blackwater in between him and the battle. You can compare it to how Tyrion leads the charge at the end out of pure necessity as well. Heck, Tyrion kills a ton of people in the book, why Stannis shouldn't be able to do the same or more I don't understand...
1371	Maia	2012-06-01	Eh, a deluge of Stannis love, I see.
How easily people forget that, according to his own "duty onto death" code, he has betrayed his brother Robert, by keeping the incest secret from him and abandoning him to Cersei's tender mercies, when he firmly believed that she had already murdered Jon Arryn to protect herself?
Also, Stannis's own prolonged inaction was responsible for Robb and then Renly proclaiming themselves kings. Book Renly didn't want to be king initially, let's remember, he was just completely opposed to Cersei, whom he rightly considered culpable of Robert's murder,  being in power. He was A-OK with Ned as regent, though.
Instead of publicizing his claim pronto after Ned's arrest and contacting the Starks/Renly, what did Stannis do? He tried to secretly sway Renly's bannermen away from under him, with very little success.
And why? Because of petty dislikes for Renly and the Starks and of the lie he tells himself re: Stormlands being "his by right", which they absolutely weren't. It may have been unfair, but Robert had 100% the right to dispose of the Stormlands however he wished, after he became king. He didn't have to give them to any of his brothers either, instead of keeping them for his own sons.
 Renly didn't know that Stannis was anymore "rightful heir" than Joff was and wouldn't have come after after his brother, if Stannis hadn't come after him. 
And let's not forget that in the books "no man is as accursed as a kinslayer" - it is a huge, huge sin, even if your close relative is a rebel.
It is one thing to have a battle, which results in one of you dying, it is quite another to order assassination, do it with one's own hands or even directly command a unit  that kills your sibling in battle (cue Bloodraven).

Tipping off Ned Stark earlier would have been dangerous because as far as he knew, Stark wasn't necessarily on his side, and if Robert denied the accusations he'd have played his hand before assembling what meagre defenses he did at the start of aCoK.Also, Stannis's own prolonged inaction was responsible for Robb and then Renly proclaiming themselves kings.

Remember that he read the proclamation letter of Cersei's incest before their encounter. Renly was ok with Ned as regent as he'd have been Stark's closest ally and his influence would have increased. When Ned chose to support Stannis' claim as Robert's heir, Renly got out of dodge pretty fast... for similar reasons Stannis left for Dragonstone that you reproached him for.And let's not forget that in the books "no man is as accursed as a kinslayer" - it is a huge, huge sin, even if your close relative is a rebel.It is one thing to have a battle, which results in one of you dying, it is quite another to order assassination, do it with one's own hands or even directly command a unit  that kills your sibling in battle (cue Bloodraven).The beliefs of characters are not necessarily true. Euron and Tyrion are the other kinslayers by your definition with the former doing it via a faceless man assassin hired consciously and the latter took a direct hand in killing his father. Stannis might suspect what was done, but he so far denies not just his own involvement in Renly's death but even Melisandre based on testimony of others. He dreamt of Renly's death but he so far has not shown any indication that he suspects it to be more than just that; a dream. Of the three, he is the only one that expressed regret over his kin's death.

1374	Maia	2012-06-01	Stannis went to Jon Arryn to try to convince Robert since as he explained to Catelyn and Renly during the encounter outside Storm's End that Robert wouldn't have listened to him and that it would appear self-serving.So? It was his duty and he had shirked it. He certainly expects of others to do their duty no matter the risks. And once he became convinced that Cersei had murdered Jon Arryn, he also knew that Robert was in mortal danger.Re: Ned, if Stannis had compelling arguments, why wouldn't he have been at Stannis's side? Stannis knew very well that Ned was honorable, loyal and hated the Lannisters.As to "self-serving" - well, it is another Stannis's delusion, isn't it? Robert had a bastard by a noble mother whom he could have legitimized and was still fully capable of producing further children. I  doubt that Stannis would have become Robert's heir longterm if he had successfully exposed Cersei. Which, I suspect, may have been another reason that after Arryn's death and Robert picking Ned over him as Hand, he didn't try.So, take your pick: dereliction of duty, cowardice or maybe darker motives in the bargain, too. However you look at it, it was betrayal by Stannis's own code.Even once the truth was made known, it did not dissuade Renly's ambition or keep him from acting flippant towards his elder brother.What truth? Stannis's late proclamation didn't contain any proof, did it? In fact, he had _less_ evidence than when he was back in KL, what with Gendry and Barra, etc. And given that both Robb and Renly have proclaimed themselves during Stannis's incommunicado passivity period that continued for at least 2 months, possibly more, it really looked self-serving "also ran" and pathetic.Yes, Cat believed him, but that's because she had corroborating evidence and intuition re: attempts on Bran and also tried to make sense of Ned's fate. Robb would have believed too. It was still nothing that would have stood up to impartial judgement, though.There is zero doubt that Robb would have supported Stannis after Ned's execution, if only Stannis had made his claim by that time. IIRC, that was one of the main objections raised against proclaiming for Stannis during the council - that Stannis gave no indication where he stood.So, yea, King in the North? Stannis's fault, 100% preventable and mainly caused by Stannis's petty resentments towards Ned and by extension Starks in general.By the time Stannis proclaimed himself, Renly had already made irrevocable commitements which he considered necessary for successful fight against Cersei. There is no way that Tyrells would have supported Stannis for the throne - they hated and feared him and wanted Margaery to be queen. There is no way Renly could have laid down that crown after claiming it without losing all credibility. Etc.When Ned chose to support Stannis' claim as Robert's heir, Renly got out of dodge pretty fast... for similar reasons Stannis left for Dragonstone that you reproached him for.Huh?! Ned never trusted Renly with the incest story or his intention to support Stannis. We don't know how things may have turned out if he had, IMHO.Renly got out of dodge when it became clear that Ned refused to take pre-emptive action against Cersei and was determined on a wholly self-destructive path.Re: kinslaying. Davos and Cressen certainly understood that that was what Mel was suggesting when she counseled Stannis to confront Renly and were horrified. Stannis is not dim - he is just in denial. He knew to send Mel close to SE to off Penrose, too.Also, Tyrion is completely screwed up psychologically by his kinslaying and Euron was more than a little mad to begin with. Additionally, that taboo is much weaker among the Ironborn than among all the other Westerosi. And yea, I absolutely expect it to haunt Tyrion for the rest of his life. It certainly did Bloodraven. I don't expect Euron to survive for long either.
1375	StannisandDaeny	2012-06-01	Stannis at first had suspicions, not certainty. Like Ned, he wouldn't want the blood of children on his hands. On top of that, he was the least likely person to be believed if he said Robert's children were born of incest because 1) his brother hated him and wouldn't name him his heir, he wouldn't even give him Storm's End 2) it seemed too convenient for him if he spread that claim, not to mention he could easily be framed for a murder of Robert if he made this claim because it would 'play to his advantage' if Robert died if he made that claim, someone else had to find out first. 3) Robert was unlikely to let his 'honour' be tarnished by making it public his wife had been cheating on him. 4) Robert was far too dependent on the Lannisters' gold to lose their support. At the point he got his suspicions, there was little reason to reveal them at all: he would either be killed for false claims or the realm would be plunged into war. When the Lannisters murdered Ned Stark and Robert and Joffrey quickly proved what a horrible King he was going to be however his suspicions were proven true and he had every reason to declare himself King and keep those abominations far from the throne - why such an extreme reaction from the Lannisters if they were certain of themselves? The genocide the Lannisters were already committing in the Riverlands was another reason to finally decide to stand up and fight the enemies of His people - during the period of time he was at Dragonstone there was no real reason to start a war with the Lannisters over something he didn't even want. Stannis was smart enough to see if he told of what he had discovered he would probably end up the same way as Ned, that's all. As for Robb, the North was about to strike a deal with Renly before Renly was killed, pretty much proving they didn't give a shit about his claim - he had no reason to regard them as allies.

1376	Ser Dermett Corbray	2012-06-01	When I saw Stannis leading the attack, kinda reminded me of the book when Robert lead the attack against the Greyjoys, first through the gates and that. Baratheons be tough bastards, eh?

The script actually had hem staying on the beach (apparently not doing too much once the initial orders were given), and the director felt that didn't work on TV.There is zero doubt that Robb would have supported Stannis after Ned's execution, if only Stannis had made his claim by that time.

However, Renly could have attempted to first talk to Stannis before making a definite move. They were brothers, after all, but it seems there was just too much animosity between them right from the start.
1379	boojam	2012-06-02	Where in seven hells is Stannis' helm!? or better yet his crown...I would like to know if it was George, or the director, or the show runners who decided not to even give him a shield.I could cite a lot of ancient and medieval king-commanders who lead from the front. Alexander the Great being the best example.In fact the Stannis of the wall first mirrors an incident in Alexander's later campaigns, where he was first to the top of a wall, and took and arrow that nearly killed him.Still Alexander wore a helm and carried a shield. Another example is Richard I. Who usually spent most of his time directing a battle, but when push came to shove would lead from the front.... and that by the by , got him killed in a latter battle in what we know know of as modern day France.But even kings did stupid things. Henry II of France was killed in a tourney in 1559 when in a joust he took a lance through the eye-hole in his helmet. Unlike what Ned told Robert ... in this world a knight , even the captain of your own Scots Guards could kill you, even tho it was a accident in this case.So crazier things happen in real history than fiction.

1380	Ser Giant	2012-06-02	His shield/helm are his men, it's the reason they showed the soldier holding his shield over Stannis' head.
Plus it's alot easier to identify who Tyrion is in a large battle than it is Stannis since he's of average height.
1381	JKeats	2012-06-02	Would he be a good ruler? No. He is a dull, unimaginative plodder with a little-brother persecution complex. He is a mediocre general who thus far in GoT HBO is 0-1 on the battlefiled and 1-0 in murdering his rival to avoid a battle. He would be as bad a King as Robert for the opposite reason. Instituting his Robespierre-like Tyranny of Virtue after he became King, would result in dissent and rebellion leading to a quick change of regime, such as Napoleon after the French revolution. I suspect GRRM feels the same way about Stannis as will be evident in upcoming books.Well no, we already have GRRM's view of Stannis on record.See this thread:  http://asoiaf.wester...ording-to-grrm/And this interview:  http://www.amazon.co...TF8&docId=49161To be sure, readers are allowed to disagree with authors, so it's not like this definitively settles the question of Stannis' righteousness.  But GRRM clearly thinks he'd make a half-way decent king.

The fact that GRRM kept Stannis in the background in the script and the director made the change is just evidence that we shouldn't act like everything GRRM writes is the right way to do it on TV.  The episode would have been A LOT worse without Stannis badassery.  This is why purist arguments irritate me, when a change makes for obvious better TV and you can't handle it then you are just being stubborn and unreasonable.

1384	BigBucket	2012-06-02	Stannis was never in a dangerous position during the battle since he is a main character who lives through at least 3 more books. And he is not a "resolute bastard." If he were a bastard he would probably put himself on the death list.Not sure if you've misunderstood me but I was using bastard figuratively not literally. Stannis will fight to the death to fulfil his duty and this was an excellent way of showing that.

1387	A Bong of Ice and Fire	2012-06-09	For those criticizing Stannis's actions - please!  This IS Stannis in all his red passion, stripped bare of everything except his all-encompassing desire to be King, which is his RIGHT. 
"Ours is the Fury", indeed!  He stayed back and watched his fleet get blown to green hell. Then instead of shrinking in horror and defeat, he took his fate in his own hands and went to TAKE what is HIS. 
It's now perfectly clear why Tywin, Tyrion, Cersei, and Varys truly feared this man. We hadn't seen that before. 
I FELT every moment of Stannis's mad charge and his reluctance to leave alive. Wow. Just wow.
George RR Martin presented us with the essences of who these characters really are in this episode. Truly the best cinema-TV-film experience I've ever had.  The rest of the writers try on their episodes, but really they are hacks in comparison.  
There is only one GRRM. And he made me understand that there is only 1 Stannis, truly.
1388	StannisandDaeny	2012-06-11	There can be only one!
1389	Batman	2012-06-11	Stannis had me wishing that he won and mounted all of the Lannisters heads on spike, including Tyrion.
If that doesnt show how badass he was in this episode nothing will.
1390	Triskan	2012-06-11	Stannis was a good general for Robert. He's a decent general now...although so far in battles he is 0-1. He's unlikely to be a good king. Although in Westeros there's not a lot to live up to, considering the last two kings.He's 0-1 if you're only counting the TV show. 
	Spoiler "I defeated your uncle Victarion and his Iron Fleet off Fair Isle, the first time your father crowned himself.  I held Storm's End against the power of the Reach for a year, and took Dragonstone from the Targaryens.  I smashed Mance Rayder at the Wall, though he had twenty times my numbers.  Tell me, turncloak, what battles has the Bastard of Bolton ever won that I should fear him?"

1392	Triskan	2012-06-11	That's one of my favorite Stannis quotes and your sig is awesome. Just wanted to pop-in and say that.Flattery will get you...very far, Ser....very far indeed.

1394	Darth Rivers	2012-07-01	Stannis leading the attack seems just perfect for him, even from the books. I am pretty sure that he got to fight on the far bank of the Blackwater in the books, though.
1395	Darth Rivers	2012-07-01	In medieval times it was common for poorer lords with fewer men at their command to fight. Kings would also fight if the situation was dire, and it was dire, seeing as his field commander had just been taken out. There's always a chance an arrow will hit you, but that chance is always small. It wasn't like he was running 3 metres ahead of everyone. As for going up the ladder first, the wall was hit where the defences were weakest - you could easily see there wasn't space on the battlements for a large number of men to await the defenders, there wasn't even enough space to get a good surround. He faced 2 vs. 1 odds at most and Stannis, as almost any man trained from childhood to be a knight and then a lord would be, is going to be more skilled than random militia / men-at-arms. It would've been a different story if he had happily been cutting away armour-plastered heavy knights, but I don't think this was as unrealistic as people are making it out to be. The fighting was in fact very realistic, I've mentioned it before but I'll say it again: the choreographer did an amazing job getting the actors to display medieval techniques. Caesar and Alexander the Great would be other examples of real-life commanders who also fought.In the end I can just bring it down to this: Stannis is a BAMF and haters gonna hate.Well, the medieval techniques weren't all that accurate, since chainmail cannot be pierced by hand weapons. Even couched lances and point blank crossbows have difficulty with that. Its only disadvantage to plate is the need for thick padding. Also, men-at-arms were no less armored than knights. As for real life examples, Stannis strikes me as a Henry V. Not the Shakespearean version, but the real deal. He's got lots of experience since his youth, he is dedicated to his goals and he doesn't shy away from the thick of fighting (in the books, he was cut off from the walls by wildfire in the river, but likely fought the Lannister-Tyrell horde as he was forced to retreat). ETA: It just struck me... Stannis is leading a starving, demoralized and disintegrating army while a strong force of enemies is approaching... The battle for Winterfell will be Stannis's Agincourt.

1396	Vandalism	2012-07-01	Stannis the Mannis Baratheon for king! Stannis for the win!
This guy is just radiating bad-assery all the time. I absolutely loved how he fought in the Blackwater, and the only scene he had that I disapprove of was the choking of Melisandre.
1397	Rockroi	2012-07-01	I do not think Stannis will ultimately prevail.  I think that Dany and her Dragons (and Stannis' ultimate hatred for the Targs... and the fact that he was going to kill her) make it hard for him to prevail against that type of opponent.
As I stated before; I think Stannis will attack the Others as King and in doing do preserve the realm long enough for Dany et al to actually beat back the Night. 
I hope Stannis gets the opportunity to go out on an honorable and just blaze of Glory.
1398	KnightOfDragonstone	2012-07-01	I agree that it was awesome, and I think Stannis is the rightful and best king for Westeros, but I can't help but feel that him charging in as an action hero just makes him seem like somoene who would be a worse king. He should be a clever and cunning military strategist who stayed back to give orders and be able to improvise with his charge. It proves that he is no coward, though.

1399	TheCasualObserver	2012-07-02	*ADWD spoilers*
I'm ashamed to admit but it took me a while before I actually started liking Stannis. I was outraged originally when Renly was killed - It was such a surprise from a series where magic has played such a small part to see magic kill off a main character and after the blackwater I assumed Stannis was finished and didn't think much more of it. But the more I read the books, the more my appreciation for him grows. In one episode of the series he explains why he was compelled to kill Renly with the shadow - his younger brother used his popularity to gain a crown, while Stannis could rely only on his right as the elder brother to rule. He held storms end for a year, ate rats when the food ran out, nearly starved alongside his men and would have were it not for Davos Seaworth. He suffered through all this but at the end of the seige storm's end was taken from him and given to Renly, who hadn't fought for it, hadn't starved for it, hadn't done or achieved anything to warrant it. Yet Stannis obeyed. He gave up his seat and went to Dragonstone like the leal lord he was. His brother snubbed him, but Stannis did nothing because Robert was his King and elder, so he had the right of it and obeyed. But then Robert dies, his "children" the product of incest with his wife and brother-in-law. Stannis knows it is his time to rule. But in spite of this, his younger brother Renly again takes what should be his - the loyalty of the reach and the stormlands. Unlike any other King in the War of the five kings, Stannis has payed his dues - Robb was just a lord seeking vengence, Balon Greyjoy was a brutal rebel seeking glory, Joffrey was an entitled ass-hat, Renly took his crown on a whim because his boyfriend told him to. Stannis is alone in having suffered for the throne. Can you really blame him for what he does to Renly? The culmination of a decade of resentment towards his younger brother who spits in his eye again when he declares himself king.It wasn't really out of character for Stannis - he did show remorse afterward but this really was the only way Stannis could possibly begin his rule and Stannid will do what is necassary.
When Stannis lost at the Blackwater he saw his forces reduced to practically nothing, just the two thousand he had left at the start of his campaign. The whole world seemed to conspire against him - If Edmund Tully had allowed Tywin lannister to cross the river, Stannis would be sitting on the throne. If someone less gifted than Tyrion had been in control of kings landing, he still could have taken the city in time for the Lannister/Tyrell attack. If he had brought Mel with him, he might have killed Petyr Baelish before a pact was made between Lion and Rose. But nothing went right and he was forced to flee. Then in his darkest moment, he sailed for the wall and resuced the kingdom from the wildlings before they could breach it. Now he marches on Winterfell, seeking to claim at least one of the seven kingdoms back. Stannis and Stannis alone is the man to rule the 7 kingdoms. Don't get comfortable Tommen, Euron, Aegon and Dany. He ain't finished yet.
1400	Ser Oswell	2013-06-14	Stan The Man showing how it is done. Brilliant!
1401	echidna	2013-07-25	I agree that Stannis would make a great king, but I absolutely cannot agree that he is the rightful king. The Targaryen empire built the 7 kingdoms, and my loyalty will always be to Fire and Blood!But Stannis's grandmother was a Targaryen. So he's the only King involved in the war who is notably Targaryen, at the time of Blackwater.Having a Targaryen grandparent wa s a notable part of Robert's 'right' to the Iron Throne. He was the oldest male leader of the victors with the right heritage.Stannis, being male, has more right to the Iron Throne than Danerys under the Westerosi rules of succession.

1402	Nedmight	2013-07-04	This is something I don't understand completely. While in Harrenhal, Tywin was talking about going after Robb in the night and decided to ride out with his soldiers. Then all of a sudden he shows up at the Battle of Blackwater Bay with House Tyrell. How did it go from a night raid to saving King's Landing? Was this a trick to keep it secret from potential spies? I understand that it was meant to be a surprise for the viewer but it was actually a bit confusing. No book spoilers please.
1403	echidna	2013-07-25	He appeared to be having two conversations at once. One about going to a battle, and another one about Robb's actions.
If you rewatch the scene you can pick out the 2 different things.
It's a common way to confuse the reader that Agatha Christie used a lot
I missed it the first time too. My guess is that Tywin was discussing going to King's Landing and then he was asked about Robb Stark, which is where we started seeing the conversation

1404	Dementia	2012-05-27	Since they really haven't set up Ser Dontos, are non-book readers understanding why Sansa didn't go with the Hound?  By the end of the conversation, it's obvious she's not afraid of him anymore.  It didn't seem like she thought it was a Cersei/Joffrey trick...  Is anyone even thinking about it?
1405	Khal-a-bunga	2012-05-28	I don't know; maybe because the Hound is a brutal killer and she is a teenage girl. If I were in her shoes, I wouldn't be too keen on traveling thousands of miles with that dude either. The Dontos sub-plot can easily be pushed to next season, and I'd bet we'll be seeing a bit more of him in the finale.
1406	Werthead	2012-05-28	Ser Dontos was in the episode (juggling in Maegor's Holdfast) so I was surprised they didn't use him more. I wouldn't be surprised if his rescue promise was in the next episode.
1407	Crown	2012-05-28	Ser Dontos was in the episode (juggling in Maegor's Holdfast) so I was surprised they didn't use him more. I wouldn't be surprised if his rescue promise was in the next episode.I noticed him too, made me laugh, he looks like such an idiot.
1408	HouseLark	2012-05-28	Yeah, Sansa refusing the Hound's offer is difficult to explain without Dontos' plot. Oh well, I guess even GRRM isn't perfect!
1409	King Rickon	2012-05-28	You think it's difficutl to explain why a young, shallow and scared teenaged girl wouldn't run off with a drunken, misfigured killer?  I mean, just the fact that they'd have to walk out of the Red Keep in the middle of a war is reason enough to not go.  And, up until this point, she's been terrified of him.  So I can't see what would have to happen for her to grab his drunk hand and run off into the middle of a city on fire with him.
1410	Frumpus	2012-05-28	I almost thought it was Moon Boy at first but then I remembered it was Dontos. So glad that he got to show up again and you have to leave it to GRRM to remember his characters. I bet in the hands of another writer, this episode would have been Dontos-free.
1411	Soiled Septa	2012-05-28	HBO may have purposely put that scene after the Blackwater episode for a few reasons.  1) Littlefinger ends up as the mastermind behind Dontos' rescue of Sansa. 2) It seems that Littlefinger returns to Kings Landing in the finale. 3) The non-readers do not realize the level of scheming Littlefinger is capable of. 4) Viewers may call bullshit if Dontos reaches out to Sansa while Littlefinger is away.
1412	Dunnii	2012-05-28	I think Martin set up the fact (for TV viewers) that Sansa didn't go by having Cersei tell her about the people who ran during the battle and she had their heads chopped off. Maybe she was just too scared to go. It's possible Cersei would not chop off her head, but it could have been a part of her fear....?

1413	towerofjoy	2012-05-28	Sansa is basically told she is better off with Stannis in control and would likely survive the sack as long as she stays put. With the Hound it would seem much more uncertain.
1414	Crown	2012-05-28	Yeah, Sansa refusing the Hound's offer is difficult to explain without Dontos' plot. Oh well, I guess even GRRM isn't perfect!Is it? I can easily understand that a 16 (?) year old girl doesn't want to go with a murderer, rapist and whatever else Clegane has done.
1415	Qwop22	2012-05-28	I suspect we will see Ser Dontos and Sansa next season or possibly season 4. The whole plot only really comes to fruition after the PW. They would not stretch out that plot line for two seasons /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />

1416	heathergalaxy	2012-05-28	It seemed to me that Sansa was betting that Stannis would take the city and she'd be safeÂ®. However I bet when she sees that the Lannisters keep on keeping on that she will wish that she had taken the Hound up on his offer and then goes along with Ser Dontos because she doesn't want to miss another chance of getting out. I think it makes total sense why she wouldn't want to go just yet.
1417	Lord Godric	2012-05-28	Ser Dontos was in the episode (juggling in Maegor's Holdfast) so I was surprised they didn't use him more. I wouldn't be surprised if his rescue promise was in the next episode.I was thinking that they would wait until next season because to have this "I'll rescue you" plot  waiting around for two whole seasons (assuming we don't even see Joffrey's death next season) might be dragging it out for way too long.  But it would be a good way to end the season for Sansa.
1418	NomadicDirewolf	2012-05-28	a viewer probably understands the reasons why sansa didnt go with the hound, at the time it was mentioned repeatedly that stannis would not harm her, and as it says in the books, he'd send her back to catelyn. So its a safer, more direct route to home without the hound, who'd be difficult to share the road with, given his violent nature and his lack of protection from any side in the war of the five kings, and stannis' victory looked all but certain at that point
1419	unBloodraven	2012-05-28	I suspect we will see Ser Dontos and Sansa next season or possibly season 4. The whole plot only really comes to fruition after the PW. They would not stretch out that plot line for two seasons /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />I agree @Qwopp22, there's still too much to come in Sansa's plot line and setting up an escape for another season when there are so many other things to focus on in the story would overwhelm the TV story.There has already been alot of cuts in terms of plot for this season (mostly from Jon's POV which is frustrating) so this I don't mind at all.
1420	Hot Pie Targaryen	2012-05-28	Dontos is also in episode 4 this season standing a few feet away from Sansa when Meryn Trant beats her. We'll see that plot thread introduced soon.
1421	Hot Pie Targaryen	2012-05-28	sorry;duplicate post again.

1422	Dementia	2012-05-29	Lots of good points, thanks!  Since *I* know that Stannis doesn't win, I think I was forgetting that Sansa doesn't know that!  And at the end of the Hound/Sansa scene it seemed obvious that she was no longer afraid of him, so I didn't think that would be what stopped her from going.  Sounds like most of my non-book reading friends think she's going to go with him!!
1423	Spidey	2012-05-29	Ser Dontos was in the episode (juggling in Maegor's Holdfast) so I was surprised they didn't use him more. I wouldn't be surprised if his rescue promise was in the next episode.And here is was, wondering whether that was Moonboy...
1424	never trust a bard	2012-05-29	I'm not sure Dontos is even going to be part of her escape.  I was thinking they might just get to the point and let Littlefinger rescue her.  They seem to be cutting out some serious middlemen this season and combining storylines.  That seems like an easy place to snip.
1425	Mulled Wino	2012-05-29	I don't think they had time to fit that storyline in yet.  No biggie, there's plenty of time later
1426	Darth Vader's Bastard	2012-06-01	there can be only so many characters, especially on a tv show, before it becomes overwhelming. they already introduced so many new characters for season 2, i don't really expect ser dontos to be a part of the show.
1427	Reposado	2012-06-02	i think it's part of the, some arcs are better left confined to a season, style. this would fit. having sansa meet with dontos can wait till LF is back in KL. they've already cast him and established him as a presence in the red keep. they need someone to coax sansa to leave, so why wouldn't they use a character, that both does this in the books and is kicking around on the show.
they've got to get her to the vale somehow. they need to get more use out that eyrie set
1428	Dunnii	2012-06-02	this thread confuses me. Dontos is in the very first scene in the first episode of season 2 and Sansa saves his life.
Seems to me he will enter her life soon. Right?
1429	The_Spanish_Inquisition	2012-06-02	Sansa is basically told she is better off with Stannis in control and would likely survive the sack as long as she stays put. With the Hound it would seem much more uncertain.This is why she didn't go. She's sure Stannis won't hurt her, and running off into an dangerous future with a drunken brute she's terrified of doesn't seem like a chance she would want to take. That's not even considering the fact that Sandor is basically a fugitive at this point. He's not a safe bet. She's still convinced that chivalry will save her. Stannis might not hurt her, but what about his men? Seems like despite what Sandor has been trying to showher, reality hasn't quite sunk in.Dontos really isn't needed here. It's just as believable to have Littlefinger holding the reins on the whole plot without including the Dontos information.
1430	Reposado	2012-06-03	Dontos really isn't needed here. It's just as believable to have Littlefinger holding the reins on the whole plot without including the Dontos information.It isn't needed, but they've already cast him. Why, if just for the one scene? Have they casted anyone with less of a role than that?
1431	iheartseverus	2012-06-03	I think it could be set up to be some great tv if they do use Dontos--the non-bookies will be all 'oh, can that drunken fool really get her out of there?'  worry, worry.  Then, he does get her out.  YAY!!  But then, we see who's behind it all, who's standing there with that oily, knowing smirk.  Peedo Petyr!  OH, F*CK ME, NOOOOO!
1432	The_Spanish_Inquisition	2012-06-03	It isn't needed, but they've already cast him. Why, if just for the one scene? Have they casted anyone with less of a role than that?Who knows. Maybe they cast him earlier fully intending to write him into the plot as per the book, but then realized they just had way too much information to convey and something had to be cut. The Dontos subplot is one of the easiest to just do away with, especially once you realize Baelish was driving the plan anyway.IMHO, the most important part of the tourney scene involving Dontos is just further establishing the Joffrey/Sansa/Sandor dynamic and less about getting Dontos into the story. Watching the way Sandor lies to Joffrey to save Sansa, and how Joffrey clearly idolizes his bodyguard is worth writing Dontos in for only one episode, IMHO.Or, maybe he'll appear next episode.
1433	rezor	2012-06-04	Damn, this site has been playing up hardcore all week so can't go back to page one to quote what a previous poster said, but in terms of it being believable that Sansa wouldn't feel safe going with the Hound because of he's violent/a rapist, etc, I agree. But surely Sansa would've been tempted when he offered to take her back to Winterfell? At this point, her options are staying to see what Stannis might do to her/ hanging about to bear Joffrey's psychotic little children/having more rosy chats with Cersei. Not very enticing options. You would think the mere mention of the name of her home would have her leaping at the chance to go back to her brothers, despite her misgivings about the Hound. Yes, he's scary as hell but he did save her from being raped and you would think that would make the idea of escaping with him a little more favourable. So that scene was not very believable for me. She didn't even look tempted.
1434	DaughterOfThe9Moons	2012-06-06	Damn, this site has been playing up hardcore all week so can't go back to page one to quote what a previous poster said, but in terms of it being believable that Sansa wouldn't feel safe going with the Hound because of he's violent/a rapist, etc, I agree.

Yes, he's scary as hell but he did save her from being raped and you would think that would make the idea of escaping with him a little more favourable. So that scene was not very believable for me. She didn't even look tempted.I agree with you. Except for the bolded part which is not supported by textual evidence. In fact when Jaime hears about the "the Hound" butchering/raping at saltpans he thinks that doesn't sound like Sandor's style. Sandor's fighting prowess is discussed and then there are his confessions about having killed multiple women and children... I think that if he were a rapist, especially considering how often he appears in the POV characters thoughts that one of them would have mentioned or hinted that this was so.Anyway, I would have thought she would have been tempted as well considering how the TV series has portrayed Sandor in a much less agressive, more toned down manner. If you think about his interactions with Sansa in the book they were way more extreme and so even without the promise of Dontos as a rescuer I don't think she would have left KL with him. As it was I feel like it seemed strange she didn't go and I think the fact that a lot of non readers thought that she was going to leave with him supports that. (Even though I personally thought it was clear she had declined his offer.)
1435	heathergalaxy	2012-06-08	Based on the last episode, my guess is that since Sansa (rightly) doesn't trust Littlefinger with her true feelings that they'll have the Ser Dontos plot to get her out of there (probably after she marries Tyrion). And then Sansa can be (again rightly) horrified that Littlefinger was behind it.
1436	Myrcella	2012-08-25	I think Sansa will escape with Littlefinger straight away. The last we see of Sansa in E10 is Baelish requesting to escape Sansa. She reluctantly refuses, and then Littlefinger says the same line Clegane said in the book, something about everyone being liars and being better than her.
1437	Masamune	2012-08-25	I think it could be set up to be some great tv if they do use Dontos--the non-bookies will be all 'oh, can that drunken fool really get her out of there?'  worry, worry.  Then, he does get her out.  YAY!!  But then, we see who's behind it all, who's standing there with that oily, knowing smirk.  Peedo Petyr!  OH, F*CK ME, NOOOOO!No they won't, because now they know Littlefinger wants to help her escape.They've more or less scrapped that plot twist now because of their need to shoehorn Aidan Gillen into as many scenes as possible.
1438	Ciazio	2012-09-07	Is it? I can easily understand that a 16 (?) year old girl doesn't want to go with a murderer, rapist and whatever else Clegane has done.13/14 years old. But she wants to go with him, they're in loooooooveeeeee..... /love.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':love:' />  He's such a gallant knight....... /leaving.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':leaving:' />
1439	acedrian	2012-09-13	I think its fairly clear that poor Ser Dontos was a victim of editing in the series. It doesn't really make sense to have him in that very first scene, and then not follow up with the whole "thanks for saving my life - now I will help you escape" thing. The only thing I can think of is that the producers intended to run the Dontos plot right up until after the first episode was made. Then for whatever reason they changed their minds and removed him from the plot (apart from that first scene). Even if they are delaying the escape plot till the next series, it makes no sense now to include this redundant middle-man - especially when no one is going to remember Dontos from episode 1 series 2 and the debt he owes Sansa.

It may be because of bad acting? The guy who played Dontos was (by far) one of the worst actors of the show, IMO.But if they shot that scene, they must have shot all the others, right?
1441	Ser Luke.	2013-03-02	I just don't get why they would show Ser Dontos in the first episode and then cut his larger parts in the rest of the season. I love the show and I completely understand they have to leave some characters out, but why introduce someone you're never going to build on?
1442	Frey-A-La-Mode	2013-06-28	I agree, something strange happened there... It may be because of bad acting? The guy who played Dontos was (by far) one of the worst actors of the show, IMO.But if they shot that scene, they must have shot all the others, right?Ya, I didn't find him very convincing in that scene either. Now I'm not sure if they'll bring him back. It seems highly unlikely that they'll replace him, because viewers aren't very likely to remember him. I wonder if they'll still do the note thing? (come to the godswood if you want to go home). Maybe she won't receive that note until the morning of Joffrey's wedding or something. I could also see Shae helping her escape... Although that one might be a bit of a stretch.
1443	TheEvilKing	2012-05-29	When I first watched the ep I assumed it was Ser Meryn that attacked Tyrion, and not Ser Mandon like in the books.However, now I'm 90% convinced that it was Ser Mandon Moore. Also, I believe it was Joffrey that ordered the attack in the TV show.Joffrey name-dropped Ser Mandon in a recent episode. Then, in this episode, when the Hound quits the battlefield Joffrey asks the two Kingsguarders to go out there and fight on his behalf. He names them Ser Mandon and Ser Boros. He also mentions Ser Mandon again shortly afterwards when he asks him to bear the King's banner.Also the Kingsguard who attacks Tyrion wears a helmet so that you cannot see his face.I think in the next ep we'll see Ser Meryn still alive and kicking and beating up little girls.Why do I think it was Joff that ordered the attack? A couple of quotes from His Grace:"Next time you kiss my sword it will be wearing my uncle's blood." He then goes on to talk about Stannis, so that's far from definitive, but..."Ser Mandon, Ser Boros, you will represent me on the battlefield." Very precise wording there, and this is GRRM who wrote the episode. Ser Mandon then goes on to try and kill Tyrion.I'll also note that in the books, Tyrion thinks Cersei tries to have him killed, but he doesn't have any real evidence as far as I can remember. So this isn't really a change. Also I'll note again that GRRM wrote the ep.
1444	ChillinLikeSerIlyn	2012-05-29	This was something the show didn't do a great job of. From what I can tell from reading posts from non-readers, most think it was Ser Meryn if they even realized it was a Kingsguard member at all. It was Ser Mandon, but the show did a poor job of setting up his character. IMO, they should have made Mandon the one who Tyrion threatens in the previous episode (instead of Meryn) so viewers would be more clear.

1445	Mediumjon Umber	2012-05-29	It was definitely Mandon Moore who tried to kill Tyrion. Unless he shaved since we last saw him, Trant has a dark mustache and stubble and he's a lot shorter.
Slightly off topic, but was I the only one who thought Moore looked pretty deformed under the helmet? Or was the helmet and lighting playing me a trick? /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
1446	Tourniquet	2012-05-29	Ser Mandon was finally mentioned by Cersei a few episodes back when she orders him to fetch Ros who she presumes to be Tyrion's whore.
1447	The Last Reyne	2012-06-02	I agree it was Mandon Moore and that it was Joffrey who ordered it. Cersei may have hated Tyrion, but she would never attack him directly.She would have gone after those close to him as she tried to do when she went after Ros. Cersei is smart enough to realize the consequences of having to face her father if she had ordered the death of her brother. Joffrey on the other hand is not smart enough and this just the kind of stupid and childish act one can expect from good King Joffrey.
1448	Reposado	2012-06-02	definitely was mandon. for one, it doesn't appear that meryn trant was near the battlements. more importantly, they're not going to off the one kingsguard that they give all speaking lines to. (besides, hound, jaime barristan obv)  not when they can drop a name and still have the role played by a featured extra.
if they killed off meryn trant, it would mean casting a balon swann or a mandon moore for next season, when they can just keep giving speaking parts to meryn trant.
1449	Zappotack	2012-06-02	I think it was Cersei who ordered the attack its been shown over and over her rage toward Tyrion about Myrcella and regarding Joffrey Fighting. And Joffrey was terrified and left command to Tyrion so theres no reason for Joffrey to have him executed at that time.
1450	Lord Varys	2012-06-02	As in the books, the assassination attempt on Tyrion is still a riddle. GRRM did not give us more hints in his script than he did in the book. In fact, the way Joffy was portrayed in 'Blackwater' strongly indicates that he was not behind Ser Mandon. And Cersei, well, she actually confirms that she is not behind it when she drunkenly says to Sansa 'if my wretched brother prevails...'. If Cersei had ordered Tyrion's death she would be damn sure he would not survive the battle!
And considering Cersei's chapters in AFfC and ADwD it is save to say that she had nothing to do with it (at least in the books). Which would leave the usual suspects:
1. Varys, who would have little/no motive (neither in the books nor in the show, since in both it's somewhat indicated that he intends to recruit Tyrion into his camp).
2. Joffrey: Technically he would have a motive, but it feels not alright, and it would also cause a problem to reveal the truth since now both Joffrey and Ser Mandon are dead.
3. Littlefinger: He is the likeliest candidate for a number of reason: He is the only one with a possible connection to Moore (both are from the Vale of Arryn). He is the one character who wants to get rid of Tyrion after he came back alive from the Vale and knows that he was behind that dagger thing (that's why Littlefinger chose Tyrion as scapegoat for Joffrey's murder). And it's also his confirmed modus operandi to have people killed while he himself is not present.
4. Ser Mandon acted alone, feeling that this Hand of the King posed a threat to his king. Actually, the way it's shown in the series this may actually be quite likely. And it would still be a possibility in the books as well.
But I concur that this was poorly set up in the series. They should have introduced the KG and Ser Mandon to the audience earlier, and they should also have shown us about this Littlefinger-Tyrion-enmity. By, say, show us Tyrion investigating Littlefinger's affairs as Master of Coin, or Littlefinger complain to Ros about this new dwarf hand instead of this stupid pimp-intimidates-prostitute-scene.
1451	Dornish Hen	2012-06-02	"Next time you kiss my sword it will be wearing my uncle's blood." He then goes on to talk about Stannis, so that's far from definitive, but..."Ser Mandon, Ser Boros, you will represent me on the battlefield." Very precise wording there, and this is GRRM who wrote the episode. Ser Mandon then goes on to try and kill Tyrion.When I first heard Joffrey talk about his Uncle's blood I thought he was talking about Tyrion!  Then I remembered that Stannis is also his uncle.  But it could go either way if you believe that Joffrey was the one who ordered the hit on Tyrion.There is also a little look on Joffrey's face after he commanded the Ser Mandon and Ser Blount to represent him.  I couldn't figure out if it was a side glance at Tyrion, or a sheepish look of shame because he was leaving the battle.  When I first watched the episode, my first reaction was that it was Joffrey who was behind the plot.
1452	I'll pay the iron price	2012-06-04	Well now we know the TV show hasnt gone with the nose hacked off plot!
1453	A Bong of Ice and Fire	2012-06-09	It had to have been Cersei. Joffrey is scared shitless and is depending on his uncle Tyrion to command. Cersei NEEDS to kill Tyrion, and she's already very fatalistic about the battle's outcome. 
Joffrey hopes Tyrion will lead them to victory; Cersei knows he won't.
1454	Jaqen Hghar	2013-03-19	I have to admit I didn't even realise it was a King's Guard member until now that I read it here; I watched the episode yesterday and read the book sometime in July/August so I had sort of forgotten that part of the plot...At this point I feel that I have to address something that's been bothering me a long time - the representation of the King's Guard in the show sucks! It's made clear in the books that the King's Guard wear all white - white tunics, white armour, the lot. Why hasn't the showmakers bothered to make that easy effort which would have made the King's Guard members so much easier to spot in the mess of armour, clothes and people that is often on screen?

1455	The Monkey	2012-05-28	So where was Sallador San in the battle?  They bothered to include him in a single scene in episode two, yet not show him in the actual battle.
Maybe he will be in episode 10, escorting Stannis back to Dragonstone, but anyone could do that. Why bother casting the role if he's not going to have any significance on the plot?
					
					
							Edited by The Monkey, 28 May 2012 - 06:22 PM.
1456	Dornish Hen	2012-05-28	I was also disappointed in the missing Salador San.  That was one of the things in the episode I was looking forward to.  His one scene this season was so great, I'd hoped there would be more.  /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />
1457	Gannicus	2012-05-28	Hmm...tbh I forgot about him.  He didn't really play a roll in the battle.  But they could have shown him on a ship watching the fight.  He'll most likely show up next week.
I also hope the show gives him a slightly larger roll than the book does.  He seems like a good character.

1460	SerMixalot	2012-05-28	shame he never hooked up with cersei!
1461	Howdyphillip	2012-05-28	I think, when the battle ragged the hardest, just before Cersei picked up Tommen...
Sallador San snuck in the throne room for a quickie...
1462	Arkash	2012-05-29	I agree, I think too he will be the one to "fish up" Davos.
1463	Greywolf2375	2012-05-29	Yeah, if they don't have him finding Davos floating or out on the little islets, it's almost pointless to have introduced him at all.  And with the way he languishs in luxury and counsels Davos, I would miss that.
1464	LÂ<U+0092>Age dÂ<U+0092>or	2012-05-29	I think he will have a larger role in the aftermath of the defeat, since he will probably be the one taking Stannis back to Dragonstone and effectively Stannis' fleet Admiral. While as others mentioned there is a high chance he saves Davos as well, additionally Stannis is in his debt so I'm pretty sure he will play even a bigger role in the future than he has in the books.
1465	Tourniquet	2012-05-29	Poor Davos...
1466	Mediumjon Umber	2012-05-29	Sallador remained outside of Blackwater Bay, so they stayed true to the book by not including him. His task was to guard the rear and, when the battle was lost, to pick up any survivors.
1467	boojam	2012-05-29	Sallador remained outside of Blackwater Bay, so they stayed true to the book by not including him. His task was to guard the rear and, when the battle was lost, to pick up any survivors.I think one sentence in the dialog would have been nice to have.
1468	Reposado	2012-05-29	yeah should have been mentioned. but it should have been last episode or the one before. just a quick scene with saan mad at davos for putting him in the rear because he will miss the best plunder would be a nice character note and an explanation of why he isnt in this episode when we had that scene of davos convincing him to go to KL.
1469	Tadco26	2012-05-29	I think it was an awkward situation that GRRM decided to avoid addressing personally, since the previous writers made Davos leader of the attack and in the books Davos notes that it was foolish for Ser Imry Florent not to use Salidor and his extremely experienced sea men, but instead keeping them as a rear guard because he didn't trust them.
1470	Michael Stark Thenextwolf	2012-12-13	Salladhor is the man "im not going to rape the queen im going to fuck her"
1471	Jaqen Hghar	2013-03-19	Salladhor is the man "im not going to rape the queen im going to fuck her"True - which seems somewhat confusing, considering that Mr JLB Matekoni until now has been known to prefer women of "traditional build" /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />

1473	Haberdasher	2012-05-28	Well. Since it's not a thread yet at least in the episode's page, I'll ask: Opinions on the Rains of Castamere?  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's a bit more country or firefly-theme styled than I might have expected, but I think it worked and I definitely think it'll work well in its later appearances (different circumstances and different people playing it).
1474	Nuttz	2012-05-28	They managed to combine the two greatest things ever: The National and aSoIaF.
1475	victim	2012-05-28	They managed to combine the two greatest things ever: The National and aSoIaF.This. My two favourite things in the entire world. I only have one complaint -- it's awesomeness was beyond my comprehension. I also loved the way they introduced it now in a very memorable way, so that it can be even more memorable in the future scene that we're all waiting for.
1476	The Last Reyne	2012-05-28	The end version was very haunting, a good sign of how it will be used later in the series and its importance.
1477	Faraday	2012-05-28	Loved it. Wasn't expecting to see it this season/maybe ever but I loved it's inclusion and the song is so haunting in the end credits. Perfect way to end the episode. 
As an aside I felt the score throughout was phenomenal.
1478	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-28	Oh yes, that was a very nice one. His voice is breath-taking, pretty perfect if you ask me. And the song in combination with the ending scene where Tywin looks like he's the ruler of the whole world, wow. But the whole episode was perfect. GRRM did a perfect job, again.
1479	_Oberyn_	2012-05-28	Meh, the song was great ofc but in credits one i did not care much about the singers accent.

1485	House Snow	2012-05-28	I thought they did an amazing job of introducing it.  Non-readers are already talking about it which shows that they were effective in making it seem important.
1486	boojam	2012-05-28	So George wrote the lyrics and did it say that Ramin Djawadi wrote the music and the arrangement?
1487	ServantOnIce	2012-05-28	Don't mess with Tywin Lannister . . . period.   As long as Tywin and Tyrion are around the Lannisters are unbeatable . .   and it is clear that the Starks are clearly  in danger.  Winterfell in Iron Born hands, The Tyrells and Lannisters united, Their only chance at an ally in ruins  .  . . welp they are in trouble.
1488	Apoapsis	2012-05-28	I've always imagined it as having the melody of the chorus from A Place to Survive by VdGG, but this works too. If they have someone else sing it one more time to really make it stick and associate it with the Lannisters, even the non-book readers may realise that something's wrong when a certain group of particularly shitty musicians start playing it...

1524	StarkWard	2012-05-28	I like how haunting it was, even just the instrumental will do. We'll certainly remember it when they use it again.
1525	gogorath	2012-05-28	Love the National's version, especially the subtle instrumentation.  Don't like any of the ren faire versions, especially anything remotely peppy.  It's a dirge, and even if Lannister soldiers might pep it up in their drinks, almost all the you tube versions are too fast, too high pitched, completely unaware of what emotion the song is supposed to convey.  Plus, the musical complexity of these is pretty simple, and the first one in particular is hopping around on the vocal melody for no apparent reason.
Perhaps the accent sounds out of place to non-Americans, but I love the modern but not anachronistic feel of it.  It's a nice device.  
Lastly, while I can respect anyone's opinion that doesn't like it, the National is a pretty fantastic band.  Great musicians, great songwriters and absolutely incredible live.

(except for possibly Ned's beheading)

1533	Bastard of Boston	2012-05-29	Love the National interpretation. Bronn's fit the tone of the show in-episode. I think the National "remix" is a great contemporary song that will fit in nicely on my iPod. It truly was a great surprise.
1534	Mulled Wino	2012-05-29	Eff the Lannisters and their song....
(it was actually pretty awesome, still eff the lannisters)
1535	Mr. E	2012-05-29	Slow and solemn, I can understand.  Listless and expressionless, just doesn't do it for me.  But, I guess that's why there are different varieties of things.I thought it was more forlorn and funereal than listless. It has the tone of a war crime, basically.
1536	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-29	I know I'm going to cry when they play the Rains of Castamere somewhere in Season 4, or maybe at the end of Season 3. 
Let the dragons take almost all the Lannisters and the Boltons.
1537	TheDarkOne	2012-05-29	There are so many good versions on Youtube. I saw a rap version once that was really cool. I will try to find it. It would be awesome to see them use different versions of it in the show.
1538	WinterWarrior	2012-05-29	I was in awe when it started playing at the end over the credits. It was SO well done. I liked that version very much and thought it was appropriate for the mood after Tywin rode into the throne room - it made me think of death and Lannister triumph.
Very, very well done.
1539	Reposado	2012-05-29	Wasn't a huge fan of the credits version. but I'm excited that now the melody is established, we can get an instrumental version later on and have it be recognized. I picture it with fiddles and an Acadian sound

1541	nara	2012-05-29	Would love to hear the end credits verion again at the following times...
	Spoiler  RW and after the toilet scene, the latter being ironic.
1542	House Balstroko	2012-05-29	To be honest this version is better http://www.youtube.c...h?v=Nj0ClrpqJhU (Christocakes).Yup, that's the version I posted. Its my favorite version so far.
1543	boojam	2012-05-29	I think on the DVD edition should have Rory McCann singing it.
1544	aimlessgun	2012-05-29	Absolutely amazing. I cannot stop listening to it, and singing it! I was tearing up at the end of the episode with Cersei's story and then the song.
As for versions, to each their own but the one from this Ep. will always be the 'real' one for me. Plus I don't notice accents in singing /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

1545	The Frostfangs	2012-05-29	Yup, that's the version I posted. Its my favorite version so far.its too upbeat to have at the RW it needs to be solemn and foreboding.
1546	Ser Redjed	2012-05-29	I loved both versions of "Rains Of Castamere", and was equally surprised to find out the closing credit version was The National, I thought it was Leonard Cohen.  Well done indeed.
1547	Abaddon	2012-05-29	Yes, very Leonard Cohen.  Loved it.  Even though I heard it before the show it still stood the hairs on my arms on end...
Since it was credits music it didn't bother me one iota that it was anachronistic with the mostly mideval tone we otherwise have.
1548	Tourniquet	2012-05-29	I thought it would be more "minstelesque" rather than the somber tone they chose. Very good none the less.
1549	Fragile Bird	2012-05-29	1st Post /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Loved how Sky Atlantic decided to talk over the end credits for half the damn song........... /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />I loved both versions of "Rains Of Castamere", and was equally surprised to find out the closing credit version was The National, I thought it was Leonard Cohen.  Well done indeed.2 first posters, welcome to Westeros to both of you!  Post often, keep a sense of humour.I mentioned on another thread that I saw a lot of bitching about the song, once they released the CD, but I liked it immediately because it is indeed very Leonard Cohen.  The voice just expresses weariness, and wariness, perfect for times of war.
1550	ChristophUL	2012-05-29	I love The National's version.  I get a sense of doom sending shivers up my spine.
1551	Valkyrja	2012-05-29	Even though I have been very vocal about my disappointment as to the lack of overall 'medieval feeling' in the HBO series (in favour of a more generic fantasy vibe), even I must admit that this song is awesome. It seems to perfectly capture the Lannisters....especially the proud, arrogant, menacing lion that is Tywin Lannister.
I can totally this as an instrumental version played both during and after (in the credits) the Red Wedding.
1552	Bozworth	2012-05-29	I'm still not very fond of The National version. But I absolutely loved Bronn & Co singing, it sounded amazing.  /wub.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':wub:' />I'm in this boat.  I liked the Bronn version, but I didn't care for the end credits version.  If they stick to the book's way of incorporating it 
	Spoiler into the RW, the melody needs to be a familiar one by that time.
  So hopefully it will get some more exposition and a more fleshed out rendition, 
	Spoiler likely from Tom O'Sevens early next season if I had to guess.
1553	Rhaegar The Rocker	2012-05-30	I'm embarrassed to admit that I didn't realize Bronn & Co were singing RoC until the end.  However as soon as I heard the National's version I knew what it was.  I always heard it in my head with Nick Cave singing it, and this was pretty close to what I'd imagined.
1554	KC_Accidental	2012-05-30	Nice Cave would have been better. I'm really not a fan of The National's version.
1555	Mark Antony	2012-05-30	idk i can't stop listening to The Naitonal's version tbh.
1556	phedre	2012-05-31	When I heard it, my first thought was "where have I heard that before?!?". Had to go re-watch S2Ep1 to confirm, yup, that's what Tyrion was whistleing on his way to the small council meeting /laugh.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':laugh:' />  And then again in Ep2!
Loved it!!
1557	Parise	2012-05-31	The first time I listened to The National's version, I didn't like it very much. But then I listened to it again and, BAM I was hooked. I love it!
1558	BlackTalon	2012-06-01	that song seems to have become a huge hit, just the original version on youtube is getting close to 600.000 clicks, and with all the identical uploads of the song it is closer to 700.000.
1559	ServantOnIce	2012-06-01	I've never heard of "The National" before this thread . . .
1560	Asarlai	2012-06-01	The use of the song was a great surprise and very well done. The lyrics have always stuck in my head, even years after first reading them.
1561	Fylimar	2012-06-01	I didn't know the band before, but it sounds a little like something, Nick Cave could do - so that's positive. I would have loved a more medieval musical approach, but this is ok for me too. It's very fitting for the things to come.
BTW: there are some more songs mentioned in the books... so there's hope for Nick Cave ;-)

1562	lannisterbannerman	2012-06-02	The National's version is incredibly gripping and powerful. They really do that song justice. Love it!
1563	the_stormborn	2012-06-16	It's interesting because the way they chose to record it in the show was so much different than what I had imagined while reading the book.  For some reason, I had pictured it as a bit louder and more energetic but I have to admit that the direction they took it in was AMAZING. 
It's so soft and so raw that I think it takes the whole read-between-the-lines theme that is so prevalent in the book to a whole new level.  It's so understated and so simplistic and beautiful that it really underscores the deeper meaning of the song.
Maybe I'm biased because I've read the books and I know what's coming in the next few seasons, but I think the simplicity of it makes it almost threatening. 
As it was meant to be in the books since the Rains of Castamere is supposed to be a warning to rebellious lords.
Brilliant.
1564	BongSooHan	2012-07-05	The Bronn version been great, but the ending credits version was much more scary.
That Tyrion has been whistling it several episodes before is just great.
1565	ServantOnIce	2012-07-05	I sure missed it!!!!!   Wow!! Great find!!!
1566	The Bloody Boar	2012-07-08	I always imagined the song as being much faster paced. After all, it's not meant to be a lament.
1567	Melpadgett	2013-03-13	Who exactly is singing in the credits...is it supposed to be a character...it sounds like Sandor, lol!
1568	ebevan91	2013-03-13	Some guy from some band noone's ever heard of.
1569	total1402	2012-10-05	In the books nobody in Westeros is aware of this until much later and certainly not the royal council; something which is a bit of a joke about how everyone dismisses stories of dragons hatching. But, Varys just told Tyrion in the second season... Why? He has no reason not to tell Tywin and Cersei. It'll beg the question of why they don't send assasians or some other response to kill Daenerys; like Robert did last time. It just felt like a really strange thing to do and I don't think the producers understood that the story would have been different if the Lannisters knew about Daenerys n dragons.
1570	Raging Throner	2012-10-19	Tyrion in the book and on the show is not devulging too much information to Cersei and Tywin. 
	Spoiler Plus, Tyrion is not on the council anymore and will be gone from KL soon.  It is also difficult to show Varys' reach as a "spy" without making it seem as though he knows everything going on in the realm.
1571	PatrickStormborn	2012-10-19	The scene had one purpose, imo: to show that Jorah has been sending reports as late as Qarth.
And it doesn't really matter, anyway, as Tyrion instantly dismisses these reports, just as they are dismissed by Tywin in the book.
1572	oierem	2012-10-19	And to try to conect Dany's storyline with the rest of the story.

I wish Dany had actually gotten that out of him after having asked just that before realising that he was involved in the plot on her child.
1574	Top12Gun	2012-10-19	The scene had one purpose, imo: to show that Jorah has been sending reports as late as Qarth.And it doesn't really matter, anyway, as Tyrion instantly dismisses these reports, just as they are dismissed by Tywin in the book.Not only to show Jorah the Homeless's betrayal, but also to portray Varys as nearly omniscient and to set the stage for him as Tyrion's ally. Besides, if he told anyone who took him seriously, it might provide some momentary unity within the government and that would undermine his goals, however fleeting that unity might be. Besides, he knows that Westeros may face a war on two fronts if he stages Aegon the Little's move for the throne, and that never ends well for the country in the middle. He may see the benefits of splitting Westeros as outweighing the problems of facing Daenerys the Unsure's dragons afterwards.
1575	Phaing	2013-02-25	Warning?If they had any idea of what was going on up at the wall... but hell, Amon Targaryon has been forgotten, I can't honestly see anyone in that Throne-room capable of understanding what the significance of this side of things.Filed and forgotten.Until the Wights punch a hole through the wall...
1576	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	The fans of Sansa and Sandor have been disappointed about how little air time the relationship between Sansa Stark and Sandor Clegane has received, going back to season 1.  Tonight, in an episode written by GRRM himself, a scene that fans of the couple have loved, was gutted.  The fleeing Sandor waited for Sansa to return to her room, and among other things, demanded a song from Sansa.  Sansa sings for him and afterwards, in the next books, starts remembering things that didn't happen, infamously, the remembered kiss.  None of this appeared tonight.
Does this mean the end of SanSan?
1577	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-05-27	Unsure.....this scene didnt have the "let's be emo drunk and stick a knife to the girl's throat" theme and was more of the "I want to rescue you...no Little Bird I won't hurt you, you are safe with me" theme....
Also, it is of interesting note that she goes into her room and picks up the doll her father gave her, holds it, and after she tells him he won't hurt her (which was more of an affirmation/statement/realization than a question), they zoom in on the doll while her hand seems to drop it while she looks after him.
That can be interpreted in a few different ways

1578	House Snow	2012-05-27	Lets hope so
1579	Ran	2012-05-27	It should be remembered that even when GRRM is writing, he still has to work within whatever parameters the writers have set. If they've radically altered a character, he has to stick with it. In this case, it seems to me that the threat of rape and the kiss and other elements of that scene that aren't present are likely not present because the producers have never made them evident and don't want them to be.
Why? I've no idea, but I have a theory or two. In any case, these missing elements don't necessarily mean that anything is "dead". I mean, how can a relationship turn on one scene like that? There's enough there that you can maybe sorta see something in the future.

It was as if George was trying to say he intended more of a daughter-ish/protector role as the core of their relationship...not a romantic one.  He is drawn to her innocence, he wants to protect her, but it's not a sexual attraction.I always thought Sansa later remembering a kiss that never happened was just her childish tendency to romanticize everything trying hard to stay alive.  She's terrified of the Hound and in no way attracted to him, yet she recalls him kissing her?  Sounds like a random firing out of one of her beloved songs about Knights saving Ladies.
1584	House Snow	2012-05-27	So cruel . . . . /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />Couldn't resist. Im quite anti Sansan.

We've had more scenes alluding to SanSan than any other non-canon pairing.Hell, it's even in the "Last Time on GoT" clips.that was to set up their interaction in this week's episode. they always show clips in the last time section to remind viewers of where we are with a character. i think hbo has shown very clearly that this is not a ship.I noticed that as well.  It was as if George was trying to say he intended more of a daughter-ish/protector role as the core of their relationship...not a romantic one.  He is drawn to her innocence, he wants to protect her, but it's not a sexual attraction.this! almost. i agree their relationship was always one of him wanting to protect her and keep her safe. he was drawn to her innocence. but on the night of blackwater bay he was drawn to it in a not so innocent way. sansa, in turn, was just following her old ways of responding to a knight in shining armor coming to her rescue. hence the false memory. it was more a sign of her clinging on to her dreams coupled with ptsd, imho.i never saw sandor's leaving the cloak as symbolic on his part but for sansa, still in her fantasy world, it is. i kind of expect grrm to have her hold onto it until she is finally ready to leave that way of thinking completely behind her.that said, sansa was amazing in tonight's episode. her performance was stellar and truly that of a queen.
1591	scurvy	2012-05-27	The Bear and the Maiden Fair.			"I called for a knight!"			"But you're a bear!"			"A bear! A bear,"			"All black and brown,"			"And cover in hair!"
1592	Bride of Winter	2012-05-27	If we're talking the romantic sense, it can stay dead for all I care. I always found SanSan icky, but I think the relationship between them is really interesting, and I sort of think this episode whitewashed it a little
1593	Lord Godric	2012-05-27	that was to set up their interaction in this week's episode. they always show clips in the last time section to remind viewers of where we are with a character. i think hbo has shown very clearly that this is not a ship.It's really no different than how it is portrayed in the books.  The only difference is that Sansa begins to fantasize about Sandor and their "kiss" later on.  I never thought they had a "ship" and I never thought canon allowed for that interpretation, at least not based on the actual interactions.  Based on Sansa's recollections later, maybe.
1594	Balefont	2012-05-27	Yeah, I don't think SanSan ever existed to the extent (or at fucking all) the shippers imply.
1595	greensleeves	2012-05-27	I agree with Christina ... there are many ways to interpret the doll
Another way to interpret the doll is that she goes from clutching it to her chest to having it hang upside down and seemingly unnoticed... this could symbolize her growing up (setting aside childhood) or it might even symbolize her letting go of a real chance to return to her father's lands.
1596	Lannes	2012-05-27	I agree with Christina ... there are many ways to interpret the dollAnother way to interpret the doll is that she goes from clutching it to her chest to having it hang upside down and seemingly unnoticed... this could symbolize her growing up (setting aside childhood) or it might even symbolize her letting go of a real chance to return to her father's lands.That's the biggest thing I took away from that scene- the doll dropping symbolizing Sansa is putting her childhood behind her.
1597	Caro99	2012-05-27	Gosh... I was literally unable to speak after the episode ended. And san/san... Wow. I was in shock trying to decide if I liked her going with him or not (but then the preview for next week crush that) ok so about a future between them: I am a devoted san/san shipper and want them to be together against all odds in the end <3 it was sad we didn't have the song or the un-kiss moment or her cupping his cheek, (I think we can still have her hugging his cloak next week- i can't recall if he was wearing any) but I loved how they both acted and the face of sandor as he wants to make her realize that all men are bad. I think the fact that after he says this and calls robb and ned killers, we don't see sansa calling him horrid but instead daring to trust him speaks volumes. And I liked how george clarified that sandor did indeed thought of taking sansa to winterfell. I like what ran said about how the show is one thing, the books another and george may not have been allowed to write the moment like he wanted, but cause it justifies my future clinging to the belief that these 2 are bound to meet again. I can see sansa in an upcoming scenario where she is either alayne stone or a sort of queen in the north unable to trust anyone and then sandor appears after the quiet isle and she remembers how he said he would not harm her... Oh well. I' writing this from my phone so I'll come back tomorrow with a clearer head /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
1598	Fragile Bird	2012-05-27	Caro99, as I said, I hope Ran's right, because I was so looking forward to the tension in that scene, and the song for Sandor and the dropped cloak.  While Sansa is surprised to see Sandor there, you don't have the fear factor from the book.  And while Sandor is drinking, he's still appears more or less sober.  And I do hope this is just a matter of time constraints.
1599	towerofjoy	2012-05-27	I think Sansa symbolized innocence to Sandor. And because he lost his very early he alternates between hating her innocence and wanting to protect it. I don't think it was sexual at all on his part.
Sansa is always looking for her Florian. Sandor and Tyrion don't really fit the bill but always save her from others like Joff seemed to initially. She has been in a desperate situation since Ned's death - and is likely looking for a protector more in the model of a father than lover.
1600	Tourniquet	2012-05-27	I think that in subsequent seasons she can imagine a remembrance of the scenario that didn't happen AT ALL. She might mention that she sang to him and he tried to kiss her when none of that happens. It will be even MORE of a fabrication of the truth in the show.
1601	Valkyrja	2012-05-27	I have to chime in here and say that I too hope Ran is correct here! /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
I love the Sansa and Sandor scenes, and was gutted they weren't featured more in the HBO series. I was hoping this episode would include a bit more at least, but even GRRM can't completely undo what was done earlier in the show (that is, to downplay it).
I also firmly believe the 'San/San' (I'm scared to even say that phrase on these boards some days!) element was toned down in the series due to the even bigger age-gap between the actors in the show than the already-wide age gape between Sansa and Sandor in the books. Despite loving this odd pairing (in terms of enjoying seeing them interact), I can see how TV audiences would find it disturbing or hard to understand if a) he was a lot more violent and angry towards her and /cool.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='B)' /> he was even remotely 'sexual' towards her.
Perhaps I am just rationalizing. Of COURSE I know this was written by GRRM, but for me.....'San/San' won't be 'dead and buried' until the characters either never meet again or die horrible deaths, or the novels end without any resolution between them whatsoever. All of which are certainly possible. Nevertheless, I refuse to believe that lack of book San/San this episode means anything other than ....this is not the books. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
1602	Lord Elrosir	2012-05-27	I also firmly believe the 'San/San' (I'm scared to even say that phrase on these boards some days!) element was toned down in the series due to the even bigger age-gap between the actors in the show than the already-wide age gape between Sansa and Sandor in the books.Bingo.  The Hound was already unlikeable enough being close to Joffrey and doing his deeds.  Where he is right now is able to have redemption with Arya.  Playing his shit out from the book would just make him seem to be a creepster to American viewers.

To have ran saying that we should not really call san/san dead now was great and made me recall george burying 'the hound' but leaving the posibility of sandor alive. damn, george really likes to keep us speculating with his subtle hints about these 2 even in the show x) I wonder how the show will deal with sansa staying in kl next week cause I really did for a moment thought they had actually decided to have them go away together.. I think that I could have forgiven the show a little as I mentioned on another thread the lack of song and white cloak if we had only seen sansa cupping sandor's cheek after he tells her that she can trust him. That would have been beautifully bittersweet <3
1604	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-05-28	HBO is setting LF up, methinks...
they already had him telling Sansa about Sandor's burns instead of Sandor himself and in the previews, they have him telling her the "Look around you, they are all liars and everyone one of them is better than you" which was.....another Sandor line!!!
SO........they are giving ALL of Sandor's lines to LF!
1605	Gaius Martell	2012-05-28	They've spent more time on Sandor/ Sansa than they would need to were that relationship not important, considering everything else that's been cut from the TV series.
1606	Fragile Bird	2012-05-28	What worries me is the thought that, lol, the 2 Ds know the ending of the series (in case anything happens to George) and the relationship has been downplayed because it ain't gonna happen.  Or, hopefully, it's been played down because, as Lord Elrosir says above, Sandor would seem too much of a creepster.
But it does seem to take away the infamous "I shoulds fucked her bloody" comment made to Arya, because there is no hint, really, of any underlying sexual turmoil in Ep. 9.
1607	ckal	2012-05-28	Sandor was trying to be....heroic. He wanted to save Sansa....but why?
We don't know the answer to this. He's always shown 'kindness' and 'honesty' with Sansa on the show. Far more than most others have at least.
1608	Lord Godric	2012-05-28	They've spent more time on Sandor/ Sansa than they would need to were that relationship not important, considering everything else that's been cut from the TV series.Absolutely.  Just the fact *any* scenes between them made it to the show says something.

1610	Buster	2012-05-28	They've spent more time on Sandor/ Sansa than they would need to were that relationship not important, considering everything else that's been cut from the TV series.From what I can see the only thing that would please SanSan fans would be 10 hours of SanSan scenes.

1612	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-05-28	well hells bells.....anything but ros and endless "i will take what is mine"  bla bla bla shut up already Dany!  lol
1613	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-05-28	my ex...(yes he's a MAN)....even picked up on something with sansa and sandor and he hasnt read the books.
he commented on it 2 episodes ago and i told him they dont interact after this season.....he was surprised
"then what's with the setup, then?"
1614	Dragon of Valyria	2012-05-28	Yeah, I don't think SanSan ever existed to the extent (or at fucking all) the shippers imply.It certainly exists on the show though--they've gone out of their way to show them together, and the scene tonight somehow turned what was sinister and scary in the book into something sweet (for a mentally damaged murderer).Still, his departure from the city at least means we won't be subjected to it anymore. Sansa deserves much better.
1615	Buster	2012-05-28	and endless "i will take what is mine"  bla bla bla shut up already Dany!  lolMy guess is that we'll get at least one more "I WILL TAKE WHAT IS MINE!!!" scene outside the HotU this season and a few (hundred) more in the seasons to come. She will never stop with the repetitive dramatic speeches.he commented on it 2 episodes ago and i told him they dont interact after this season.....he was surprisedWe still have two books left, they have time to meet again.

1617	Cat from The Canals	2012-05-28	I thought that the kiss was very important and was surprised that GRRM left it out. I never saw Sandor as looking at Sansa in a sexual way but in a protective way. On the other hand that kiss was so important because Sansa reflected on it so many times like he could have been her real Jonquil; she should have left with him that night. It showed compassionate side of the Hound especially when her flashbacks parralled the story of  The hound traveling with Arya and showing her compassion in his warped Clegane way.  I love the series and I know it would be impossible to cover all the details of ASoIaF but I think they could work in at least 2 more episodes per season

Sansa invents it in her memory.

I love the series and I know it would be impossible to cover all the details of ASoIaF but I think they could work in at least 2 more episodes per seasonHe never kissed her. She imagines it later.I haven't seen the episode yet, but from everything written about it, the scene makes sense with the way the characters have been portrayed so far. It's a shame Sandor's character has been whitewashed, but the show character is still good. I'm looking forward to the Arya/Sandor interactions in seasons 3 and 4.I shouldn't really comment yet, but in terms of Sandor and Sansa actually having a romantic relationship. Well although the attraction is hinted at and there is a lot of foreshadowing to discuss, realistically it is unlikely to happen, or be short lived and end in horrible agonising death.I do think they will meet again other wise HBO would have cut their scenes or actually made him more of a threat because scared victim seems to have been Sansa's main role this season. Certainly by the sounds of this episode there might be a protector type thing going on.At least it sounds like the characters of Sansa and Sandor got a decent amount of character development in this episode, which apart from Robb/Tallisa and Arya's character development, has been my main gripe with this season.
1620	Maroucia	2012-05-28	HBO is setting LF up, methinks...they already had him telling Sansa about Sandor's burns instead of Sandor himself and in the previews, they have him telling her the "Look around you, they are all liars and everyone one of them is better than you" which was.....another Sandor line!!!SO........they are giving ALL of Sandor's lines to LF!I hate them for that!!! HATE THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!  /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' /> /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' /> /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' /> /bawl.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bawl:' /> /bawl.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bawl:' /> /bawl.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bawl:' />

1625	Eggplant Wizard	2012-05-28	Sandor was trying to be....heroic. He wanted to save Sansa....but why?We don't know the answer to this. He's always shown 'kindness' and 'honesty' with Sansa on the show. Far more than most others have at least.Sandor acts like that because his character is meant to be somewhat ironic. He hates knights because Gregor is a knight but Sandor embodies many knightly virtues. For instance, he always protects Sansa from beatings and refuses to hit her.
1626	Maroucia	2012-05-28	c'mon maroucia.....what didja think of tonightI didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t watch the whole episode yet since I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have HBO so I have toâ<U+0080>¦ humâ<U+0080>¦ download itâ<U+0080>¦ in a not so legal wayâ<U+0080>¦ I wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t say moreâ<U+0080>¦(I already said too much... /blushing.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':blushing:' /> )I have the episode already on my computer though, and went through all of the scenes to get an idea of the subject that we are talking of right now, and Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m highly disappointed about that specific element.

This is the worst reason ever, because, if HBO really felt this would have been too awkward, then why pick Rory to play the Hound and not choose a younger actor in the first place (as the Hound is supposed to be)??? I looove Rory as the Hound, donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t get me wrong, but it was HBOâ<U+0080><U+0099>s choice to cast an older actor, they knew what the story would be, so to me, itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s plain BS!They had no reason to change this storyline; itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s obviously a lack of interest from the producers that created this unbearable situation, to me of course ( and to a few others, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m sure).EDIT: of course, this post is about the whole season and not so much a complaint about this week's episode, as there was no way to fix this mess at this point...

1627	Patchface12	2012-05-28	I don't want Sandor and Sansa to be together, but I liked their relationship in the books. I guess D & D thought the pedopheliac overtones of their relationship would make Sandor less likeable to a TV audience. So they've just reduced him to some random scary guy in the background who kind of feels sorry for her.
I liked how much screen time he got in the episode, but I hate the dull monotone he speaks it all in. Book Sandor was bitter. HBO Sandor seems like he could give a crap about anything. I like that he cursed out Joffrey, but I wish he'd done it with more passion. Once again, I blame the directors for this. "Give me less"
A lot of fans like the Hound and Jaime, even if they started off as haters, but some read past their more redeemable acts and think, "Whatev, still totally hate that guy."
If your like that, I don't care, but I'm worried one or both of D & D are in this camp regarding Sandor

1631	Villemo	2012-05-28	Maroucia, don't worry /grouphug.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':grouphug:' />  we have books, imagination, of course it's a pity that TV series 'murdered' SanSan thread.

1632	zuziako	2012-05-28	Regardless of how Sansa-Sandor relationship will play out in the books (or won't play out at all), you can't say there was no sexual interest from Sandor side. It was not just "father-like protection", or whatnot, it's naive to think that. He commented on her tits and figure, noticed how she almost look like a woman, and in the blackwater scene in the books he DID think about raping her, he even said it himself to Arya later (that he "should have raped her"). That does not mean he didn't wan't to protect her, but still the sexual interest was there. 
It is true however that in the tv version this was toned down immensely, that aspect was generally lost. Which could  mean that it was not important enought to keep, and that pointing to the conclusion SanSan was only a book2 thing, and will never resurface later. But nothing is certain... not with George anyway. Relationships can play out in so many ways...
1633	Lyanna Stark	2012-05-28	Yeah, I don't think SanSan ever existed to the extent (or at fucking all) the shippers imply.Female son, I am disappoint.

1637	Kobayashi Maru	2012-05-28	@Maroucia I'm in the simillar situatio like you regarding this episode,I have it but I just saw that one scene and my little hart was broken. /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />
I just lost all hope they will end up together.I just have some strange feeling that GRRM was considering it before all that 5 year gap issue between the books and when it didn't turn out as he planed and characters didn't age 5 years he decided to go in completly other direction.Right now I'm almost convinced that unkiss situation was just GRRM and not Sansa missremembering.He wrote couple of versions and used the one whithout the kiss and later over the years just forgot..or something and included the scene in which she remembers it.Later when faced with it he realised what he had done and made up this it is important part BS.
I'm sorry but I'm just sooooo disapointed I am starting to turn against GRRM /worried.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':worried:' />  so not like me to have all this Misery moments.
And the fact that they gave all his best lines to LF is even scarier and more disapointing.Now it looks to me that those two will hook up.Now if you ask me THAT is sick.I just don't see it because I am convinced LF was the one who wispered in Joff's ear to do what he wants and kill Ned.And being with a man who played part in your father's murder is way worse than being with much older man with anger issue.
Honestly I had my doubts about Sansa and Sandor the minute I saw they casted Rorry.I love him and he is doing great job but he IS quite older than her and I thought no way they are showing him touchin her all the time.
I can't wait for the next book.I am definitely going to go all Misery on GRRM /mad.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':angry:' />
1638	Raksha the Demon	2012-05-28	I was personally disappointed that the key Sansa/Hound interaction lasted what, all of two seconds; while Varys and Tyrion verbally fenced about sinking ships for just as long with not much of a point.And don't get me started about Sansa deserting the frightened women in the Keep after telling them to pray.There were at least some good Cersei/Sansa bits.Best Sansa moments - her asking Joffrey if he was going to be leading from the front; that's what her brother Robb always does...
1639	Fragile Bird	2012-05-28	Just got caught up from last night - wonderful comments everyone, and as usual, I am out of likes, so here's a group hug for all of you /grouphug.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':grouphug:' />I'm glad so many of you share my thoughts, lol, I'm not the only, ermmm, strange one!!
1640	Kittykatknits	2012-05-28	Why? I've no idea, but I have a theory or two. In any case, these missing elements don't necessarily mean that anything is "dead". I mean, how can a relationship turn on one scene like that? There's enough there that you can maybe sorta see something in the future.Any chance you would share those theories? I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.....The scene between the two of them makes sense when I consider the changes that have been made to their storyline this season. I'm disappointed about the entire S2 arc between them so this episode doesn't really matter all that much to me, I didn't expect much to begin with. I don't understand why she did not go with him though. In the books, it made sense but that doesn't translate to the tv show. He outright stated that he would take her home, keep her safe, and not hurt her. She even acknowledges this fact. Her reasoning seems to be that Stannis and his men won't hurt her? That strikes me as rather weak. That portion made no sense to me at all.I don''t think SanSan is dead or over. There is an active SanSan thread over in the books section in the forum with lots of really good reasons why they are likely to meet again in the books. IF the only character/plot change the show made was to the relationship between Sandor and Sansa, then I would be worried. But, that isn't the case at all as we have changes to Dany's storyline, a huge change to Jon's that has resulted in changes to his character, changes to Robb's, a weakening of Catelyn's character, and whitewashed Tyrion. The differences between the books and the show were bigger this season than they were in the first and I expect that to continue going forward.So, I don't think we can predict future events in the books based on the TV show which I am very glad about. The books are my canon. I enjoy the show in some respects but it's a pale imitation to what I really love - the books series.San/San isn't dead for me at all. I'll stubbornly cling to hope until the last page of the last book. I'm a sucker that way.

1641	Queen of Winter	2012-05-28	Unsure.....this scene didnt have the "let's be emo drunk and stick a knife to the girl's throat" theme and was more of the "I want to rescue you...no Little Bird I won't hurt you, you are safe with me" theme....Also, it is of interesting note that she goes into her room and picks up the doll her father gave her, holds it, and after she tells him he won't hurt her (which was more of an affirmation/statement/realization than a question), they zoom in on the doll while her hand seems to drop it while she looks after him.That can be interpreted in a few different waysTrue about the doll being interpreted in a few ways, Christina. I kind of took it to mean that part of her (the child still existing in her) was clinging to things that she took comfort in---things like the doll , partly because her father gave it to her.  (If you remember in AGOT the book, Sandor at one point came up behind Sansa, placing his hands on her shoulders--she thought it was her father, until she turned around and saw it was the Hound).I think her holding the doll also kind of symbolized that she wasn't quite "ready" to leave with Sandor, just yet. (i.e. remember that old saying about letting go of 'childish things',etc)Quite frankly, I'm disappointed in the SanSan story line thus far (as many of you are). I understand that they have to change things for TV and all, but l was hoping the Blackwater episode might be closer to what happened in ACOK. Not surprised they changed it, but still somewhat disappointed with it. Just my two cents for what it's worth......

1642	ZenderZill	2012-05-28	I think in the series they're focusing on the long term character development of Sansa.
In a general sense, throughout all of Joffrey's cruelty, drunk Cersei scaring her, Sandor/Tyrion (later) looking out for her, Littlefinger's schemes, etc... its all about her growing into a hardened woman.
She starts the first book as a complete idealist, thinking that beautiful knights are honorable, queens are gracious, and that imps and monsters are evil. Her character arc over all the books is about her going from being a shallow little girl to an understanding woman worthy of being Catelyn and Ned's daughter.
I think they're sticking to it quite well in the show, and in particular in this episode they did it exceptionally!
1643	jons nissa	2012-05-28	IF the only character/plot change the show made was to the relationship between Sandor and Sansa, then I would be worried. But, that isn't the case at all as we have changes to Dany's storyline, a huge change to Jon's that has resulted in changes to his character, changes to Robb's, a weakening of Catelyn's character, and whitewashed Tyrion.but those are all character changes or modifications. a relationship change would be a major plot change. however, since robb/tylisa and dany are still up in the air, i may change my tune after next week's episode. i doubt it though. from all the side glances tylisa throws, i still expect her to be part of the plan to destablize robb and i expect dany to still have enough of a khalasar to move on with.as for what is shown to transpire between sandor and sansa, it appears to portray it as a type of friendship that benefitted both of them. and as the only friend she has that has always looked out for her well being and tried to help her recognize what is happening around her, i have no doubt they will meet again. the hound has shown that he genuinely cares about sansa in both the series and the books. and sansa learns to see the hound's true worth as a person and as knight in both the series and the books. but there doesn't seem to be any hints of romance at all on the show which is made with an understanding of where the story will eventually wind up. make of that what you will.
1644	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-05-28	well dont forget the HBO producers are....*gasp*.....MALE!  Thats right, they are men,......
SO...in their testosterone minds, they are naturally going to focus on the "cool" characters such as Tyrion. 
They dont much care about "blossoming females", unless it involves showing her boobs and having endless sex.
The whole Sansa/Sandor dynamic was naturally lost to them.  That is a given.
Just as I am sure they will make Sansa like Tyrion and like being his wife, if only because they adore the actor.
Besides, unlike the books, Sansa isn't friendless...she has Shae now
1645	Greywolf2375	2012-05-28	I'm definitely not a SanSan person, but I do like the dynamic they have.  Since we still have a long way to go with the TV series I'm sure there will be plenty of opportunity for Sansa to morph how she got the cloak and how she remembers their parting to be different.
That being said, if it is dead and buried, I'm completely ok with that.
1646	Patchface12	2012-05-28	The fact that they gave Sandor's line about how he got his burns to LF pissed me off a lot, but this "they're all liars here, and everyone better than you" I like, esp if she's coming back from her meeting with Dontos, which he set up in the first place. That I found oddly appropriate and creates a twist of irony to the sceneTho HBO's Hound has been a huge disappointment to me
1647	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-28	I'm definitely not a SanSan person, but I do like the dynamic they have.  Since we still have a long way to go with the TV series I'm sure there will be plenty of opportunity for Sansa to morph how she got the cloak and how she remembers their parting to be different.That being said, if it is dead and buried, I'm completely ok with that.She still could have the cloak he wrapped around her shoulders when Joffrey had her punished and Tyrion came in to save the day in a badass-Tyrion way. Because, during Blackwater, he didn't have a white cloak if I remember well. besides, I don't think she will remember their parting different than it was. He never came too close to her, never *almost* kissed her, he only offered to take her with him.  Lucky for us, he'll be there next season and I still hope we'll see more of him in the last two books.

1648	Leia	2012-05-28	After all the disappointment this season, and I'm not only referring to SanSan scenes but a lot of others, I need to say I don't care anymore what happens in the show. I'm sick of HBO. As much as I loved season 1, I equally do not like season 2. Only thing I care about now is for Sandor and Sansa meeting again in the books and preferably having a true romantic relationship. Unfortunately, I think that ship has sailed (or rather sunk), mainly because probably GRRM didn't actually want to foreshadow that story and as he was writing the episode now, he might have wanted to make it clear we can not expect much in the future books (or show). There is also a possibility that he, at first, meant for it to happen later, but then had a change of heart - I really think he wants to spite the fans actually and especially with SanSan being so much shipped... And maybe thing for the other discussion, but I would nevertheless like to mention it. I have had a strong feeling recently that Sansa might end up as queen actually and I can not see how Sandor might fit in as her husband or even lover since I doubt that Sansa would cheat on her husband (who would be king also).
I also have to say, I am a hard SanSan shipper but I gotta be pessimistic because if I weren't these kinds of things would sadden me even more than they do. You know, better to be surprised in the end than disappointed.
And for all of you who don't like SanSan or don't ship it - I can not blame you, everyone of us have a different view on things and if we would all have the same opinion the discussions would be utterly boring. /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
1649	Valkyrja	2012-05-28	I feel your pain everyone.....I may have to bow out of this convo (not that anyone cares) simply because the prospect of the San/San being over and done with forever due to evidence found in a TV SHOW is waaaay too depressing for me. /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
One reason I am really pissed off is because I feel it is extremely unfair that we are now supposed to be taking the HBO version as 'canon' because of GRRM's involvement and D&D's knowledge of the series' end. I did not start watching an HBO show only to have them 'spoiler' me and ruin my enjoyment of the later books in the series because I can now deduce things that are or aren't going to happen via what happens in the tv series. /bs.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bs:' />
Bugger that.

1650	Maroucia	2012-05-28	I'm not giving up on SanSan book. Not yet.As others have said, GRRM didn't have that many options when writing this episode since he had to work with a totally different storyline than the one that he has created. The bedroom scene to be believable, had to be way different than the book version, otherwise it would have been extremely weird and out of place.HBO totally messed up though. /tantrum.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':tantrum:' />And as Kittykatknits has mentioned, Sansa has no reason not to go with the so nice and almost knightly tv-Hound, she even comes across as stupid for not going with him. He clearly tells her with no ambivalence at all that he will bring her to Winterfell!!! WTF??Go with him girl! GOOO!!!!!!!!  /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />Even though I do love tv-Hound, heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s really dull in comparison to the fierce, complicated and quite psycho book-Hound that we loveâ<U+0080>¦Soooooo sad!!! /bawl.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bawl:' /> /bawl.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bawl:' /> /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' /> /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />
1651	Valkyrja	2012-05-28	On another note, I've read a number of reviews of the episode (written by non-book-readers) and they are breaking my heart! So many people think that Sansa (in dropping the doll) is actually going to leave with the Hound! They are rooting for her to do so! When she doesn't (as I know the show wouldn't dare stray so far from the books into territory that would make the San/San fansdie of happiness.....gods forbid! /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' /> (They apparently only allow Arya to have sojourns with people she never even met in the books.)So even with such a small dosage of 'San/San' in Blackwater, GRRM is still able to troll even the tv-show fans into thinking 'something' of this pairing! /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />OK......taking a deep breath now..... /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />Edited to say: Forgot to mention Maroucia, that yes, the way this scene plays out, all those viewers who thought they were 'onto' something in that episode will now be back to thinking that Sansa is a complete idiot. Yes, some people say she was an idiot for not going with the Hound in the books as well, but his motives and, erm....violent manner of asking were at least a deal more ambiguous (to her, at the time) in the books than in the show! They never adequately showed how frightened Sansa was of the Hound. Possibly due to the combination of aging her up and softening the Hound down. I used to think that aging Sansa up would be a good thing for these scenes on-screen, but actually now I think its been detrimental, because now it seems they are saying she supposed to be old enough to fully understand and accept and even *articulate* what the Hound wants to teach her, but that she still makes dumb choices anyway. Grrr.Edited for clarity

1652	Grail King	2012-05-28	Ok ok I could not stay away until tomorrow I'm afraid to say /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' /> lol, well fragile bird and valkyrja, I totally agree with what you both said! To have ran saying that we should not really call san/san dead now was great and made me recall george burying 'the hound' but leaving the posibility of sandor alive. damn, george really likes to keep us speculating with his subtle hints about these 2 even in the show x) I wonder how the show will deal with sansa staying in kl next week cause I really did for a moment thought they had actually decided to have them go away together.. I think that I could have forgiven the show a little as I mentioned on another thread the lack of song and white cloak if we had only seen sansa cupping sandor's cheek after he tells her that she can trust him. That would have been beautifully bittersweet <3I posted in another thread, that I felt the cupping or a palm on the face would have been a good way to leave that scene, but I like it just the same, I think it's open for the future.

That would turn out as a huge mess also, I have no doubt about itâ<U+0080>¦
1654	Grail King	2012-05-28	Sandor was trying to be....heroic. He wanted to save Sansa....but why?We don't know the answer to this. He's always shown 'kindness' and 'honesty' with Sansa on the show. Far more than most others have at least.A daughter or SISTER - he may never have / LOST
1655	Maroucia	2012-05-28	I posted in another thread, that I felt the cupping or a palm on the face would have been a good way to leave that scene, but I like it just the same, I think it's open for the future.It does, but the dynamic is totally changed and not as half as interesting as in the one in the book. There's nothing really special about it as it is now...

1656	Grail King	2012-05-28	I think some of you are too hard on the producers, and the comment of they are men after all was really sexist .
I've always looked at this relationship from a fathers view, no way would I want my 12-18 year old hook up with someone with so many issues as Sandor has and I think that's the tack they are using for the show.
We still have the death of the Hound and quiet isle so let it play out, the end should match the book if they have the info GRRM gave them and GRRM was in on this episode.
1657	jons nissa	2012-05-28	the way this scene plays out, all those viewers who thought they were 'onto' something in that episode will now be back to thinking that Sansa is a complete idiot.i don't believe that will happen. i am by no means a huge sansa lover but no one can deny that sansa shows true leadership in last night's episode. she is far more queenly than cersei was (which is exactly how that played out in the books). sansa is clearly growing and adapting.but yes, it is puzzling why she doesn't go with sandor especially after saying she doesn't believe he will hurt her. curious to see if and how they will address that next week.It does, but the dynamic is totally changed and not as half as interesting as in the one in the book. There's nothing really special about it as it is now...why must it be all or nothing? i found their relationship special in the books and i find it special in the show. but i never thought they loved each other or expected some sort of romance from them. westeros is shown as a place where kindness, affection and loyalty are detrimental to one's life. still, sandor dares to show his vulnerable side to sansa and stands by her as much as he can. she in turns dares to be honest with sandor and may be the only one to respond to him softly. they both are each other's lifeline to all that they secretly hold dear (which i believe explains why he went to her room and why she keeps his cloak). how is that not special?must it involve romance?
1658	Soiled Septa	2012-05-28	Does this mean the end of SanSan?i think hbo has shown very clearly that this is not a ship.The way I see it, a "ship" is in the hands of the fans. It does not matter what Martin writes or HBO shows us. If we sense an attraction, for whatever reason, the "ship" is there.I do not consider myself a shipper at all but I love the dynamic between The Hound and Sansa. As for the Blackwater episode, I think that shippers have more to grasp onto. "I'll take you to Winterfell" (Swoon) /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' />
1659	Kittykatknits	2012-05-28	but those are all character changes or modifications. a relationship change would be a major plot change. however, since robb/tylisa and dany are still up in the air, i may change my tune after next week's episode. i doubt it though. from all the side glances tylisa throws, i still expect her to be part of the plan to destablize robb and i expect dany to still have enough of a khalasar to move on with.You mean relationship changes like between Tyrion and Shae, Joff and Cersei, Robb and Talisa -who is a completely new character? We don't know yet about Jon and Ygritte, I think that one is to soon to say right now.
1660	Chelly	2012-05-28	I said much of my thoughts on the SanSan(dirty word /drunk.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drunk:' /> ) scene in the episode discussion, but I'd like to go in more detail about it. Looks like I found the right place /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> . I really loved this episode. Its one of my favorites in the series so far, but I was expecting more from the Sansan scene. I don't think the scene would have looked as good on the show than in the books, so I understand the need to change some of it, but he was presented so...KNIGHTLY. That is my main issue, I think. Shunning the evil king/fiance and then offering her a straight up faitrytale type rescue and then whisk her away back home and safe from the evil fiance while protecting her and defending her honor along the way. Her not going with him makes no sense in the context of the show.If she stayed, there would be two options.Stannis wins: At best, Stannis won't harm her(he won't treat her unkindly at least), but he will still keep her as hostage and use her as leverage against her brother and the North's cause. There is a worst case scenario  but she's unaware of that, she doesn't know about Mel, R'hollor sacrifices, or Stannis' willingness to go along with it and what might happen to her if Robb refuses to bend the knee or compromise.Lannisters win: At best: Then she's stuck in the same predicament except THERE IS NO HOUND to stand between her and her king or his sick desires. Joff made it clear he doesn't give a shit what happens to her as this was demonstrated during the riot. He was going to leave her out there to be beaten, raped, killed or possibly all three. It was Sandor who came through for her as he had in the past, stopping her from making a fatal error in attempting to push Joff of the balcony(last season) and backing her up in her bullshit reason for why Joff shouldn't kill Dontos. Now she can marry Joff and he's allowed even more freedom as her husband to abuse her as he likes. Worst case scenario: uuumm, they find a reason to have her executed.In the book, we can totally understand why, regardless of her shitty predicament, she chooses to not go with him. He's scary, drunk, threatening, and had put a blade to her throat. Also, there is the huge promise of Dontos and his plan to have her escape. She has a hope to hold on to, so why would she risk it for this very unstable and unpredictable drunk whose motives and what he wants from her are not very clear. Honestly, the way he is presented on the show at moment and in the past makes her look dumb for not going with him. He was planning to take her HOME! Yes, Winterfell is less than an ideal place at the moment, but his point to was to bring her back to her family and loved ones.I'm sorry, but I think I may have strayed from the topic a little. I don't think SanSan is "dead", but I don't think SanSan is ever going to fully happen either. I love the interactions between the two because I felt that both were very crucial to each other's growth and transformations, Sandor for starting to become a slightly better person and Sansa for shedding her naive fantasy and preconceived notions of beauty, good, evil, love, hate thus forcing her to grow up. I can't see these two ever becoming an "item" but I can see them developing a very deep and intimate(emotionally!) companionship of sorts. He's always played a protector type role for her which I love and I actually prefer to keep the possibility of a romantic attraction/attachment very ambiguous than it being front and center. It actually makes SanSan much more interesting and compelling for me. Perhaps I'm a romance masochist. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />Don't fret SanSan fans. I'm sure this won't be the last of them. I think Sansa dropping her doll represented her immediately regretting her decision and understanding everything he has said to her. This shows some promise to me if she's accepting and taking in some value of his words to her. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
1661	Fragile Bird	2012-05-28	I agree with what you are saying Chelly.  But I'm curious, Dontos has disappeared - what does that mean about escape?  Will they bring Dontos back in Season 3, having left him out more or less in Season 2 just so that fewer balls are being juggled plot-wise?  I see speculation that Shae has replaced Dontos - the thought that Shae would deliver Sansa into LF's hands makes sense in some ways, if we see Sansa and Tyrion marry, and Shae sees this as an avenue to get rid of a rival and yet help someone she seems to be warming to.  They have already changed Shae so much, book Shae certainly wouldn't do it.
But I really miss the fierceness of Sandor.  In the HBO series, yes, he's the fierce warrior, but he's not that mix of fierceness/angry man/simmering brother hater/despiser of knights in the way book Sandor is.
I constantly repeat to myself what my girlfriend's then 16 year old kept saying to me about Harry Potter - HP the book and HP the movies are not the same thing.
1662	Balefont	2012-05-28	They've spent more time on Sandor/ Sansa than they would need to were that relationship not important, considering everything else that's been cut from the TV series.It exists to exploit the whole white knight saving the princess trope but not to the extent that there is an intent for a romance.  It's more to teach Sansa that there is more to a person than how they look.  Cute Joffrey is a bastard and ugly Sandor is (somewhat) chivalrous.  That's it.  I think the show is doing a better job drawing those lines than perhaps the books may have.  However, in the books, you never get a physical attraction reaction from Sansa during ANY of her POV chapters when she is interacting with the Hound.  She just doesn't feel at all for him like some here hope and imply.
1663	Maroucia	2012-05-28	why must it be all or nothing? i found their relationship special in the books and i find it special in the show. but i never thought they loved each other or expected some sort of romance from them. westeros is shown as a place where kindness, affection and loyalty are detrimental to one's life. still, sandor dares to show his vulnerable side to sansa and stands by her as much as he can. she in turns dares to be honest with sandor and may be the only one to respond to him softly. they both are each other's lifeline to all that they secretly hold dear (which i believe explains why he went to her room and why she keeps his cloak). how is that not special?must it involve romance?I was not talking about romance since at this point in ACOK, there isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t really any to say the truth.The SanSan relationship is a complex one because it involves a weird mix of trust and fear on Sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s part, while the Hound wants to protect her but is also torn between his not caring persona and another deeply hidden part of him that canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t bear to see this poor girl being mistreated all the time. This situation creates a conflict in Sandorâ<U+0080><U+0099>s head that increases his rage, as we can obliviously see by the way he acts every time heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s around Sansa. Add to that a sexual tension (that is for now, only there because of Sandorâ<U+0080><U+0099>s interest) and you have the book SanSan of ACOK that is lacking in the showâ<U+0080>¦

They have already changed Shae so much, book Shae certainly wouldn't do it.Exactly, the lack of Dontos is strange. Why even bring him up at his point? The lack of Dontos just adds to the wtf-ness of her choice to remain at KL. I still think Dontos will have a part in her escape since he was introduced and it was made clear he owes her big time. Shae being involved is interesting. Maybe she will have a hand at Sansa's escape, but I hope she doesn't replace Dontos because then his scene would have been pointless.

1666	Lord Godric	2012-05-28	SanSan shipper may just be worse than Harmony shippers.
Just the mere fact that the relationship has got a handful of scenes shows that they haven't discarded it, which they easily could have. The outrage I see at the producers and the sexist comments about them being men seriously confuse me. I guess the only thing that would make the shipper happy is a SanSan spinoff.

Completely unnecessary for the plot yet it was there.  Like I said I think only a spinoff with ten hours completely dedicated to SanSan would appease the shippers.

She just doesn't feel at all for him like some here hope and imply.Huh? As the books are actually what Martin wrote, and with the show devolving into ridiculously bad fan fiction, I think I'll take my cue from the former. Doing so, one cannot miss reading Sansa's thoughts later on when she and the Hound are separated: thinking of him climbing into her bed, and kissing her. We don't get a physical reaction from her because most of her thoughts on it seem to be somewhat subconscious and she doesn't crush on the Hound as she does with Loras Tyrell for instance.***I think the show missed a great opportunity last night to create some suspense and mystery concerning Sansa's decision to go with the Hound and whether the unkiss really happened - if indeed they're going to reference this in later seasons. As he's walking out, they could have had her say "Wait!" The effect of this being that we would not have known (until next wk) that she didn't go with him, and we would not have known precisely how they parted, meaning that a kiss could have taken place.Ah well. To come back to Fragile Bird's question in the OP: No, Sansan is not dead and buried. It's just been fucked with.
1673	Lord Godric	2012-05-28	Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not true. Just one other scene, a five minute scene and I could have been happy.

Then that seems like a petty complaint.
1674	Lyanna Stark	2012-05-28	. As he's walking out, they could have had her say "Wait!" The effect of this being that we would not have known (until next wk) that she didn't go with him, and we would not have known precisely how they parted, meaning that a kiss could have taken place.Instead, Sansa looks like the Dumbest Person in Westeros and she is going to get slagged off to hell and back again in the next season for not loving Tyrion, her awesomesauce husband.(It was actually my SO who complained to me about this first as he could not for the life of him understand why this was changed, in light of what a huge fan favourite Tyrion is.)
1675	Wouter	2012-05-28	The problem with Sansa's scenes in this episode is that she a)implied that she was praying for Tyrion's death (a departure from the books, where she prayed for his safety at this point, adding him as last when she prayed in the sept) and b)that non-book readers will not understand why she refused to escape with Sandor. Especially when it comes out that Sandor indeed escaped and Sansa is still stuck as a captive, next week. Right now, quite a few people watching the show think she actually went along. What reason does show-Sansa have to not go with him, other than she might be afraid of the danger (but book-Sansa is actually brave)?
As for Sandor, like many characters he has been softened to some degree - much like Tyrion has been softened. Some things just wouldn't come over very well on TV, I suspect, and apparently the producers don't want the audience to lose sympathy with a number of characters. Sandor apparently is one of them, which is not necessarily bad for any future involvement with Sansa.
1676	Grail King	2012-05-28	Just to put out there, this is not a love story of SanSan, it is  one story out of many of the metamorphosis of a young naive girl to a young independent woman who may or may not be a player in this world, but will be strong enough and wise enough to make it on her own, what better way to honor her parents, to be as strong as her lady mother, as honorable as her lord father and a bit more savvy in politics.
And just to remind everyone she's doing this without the protection of her wolf.
1677	Maroucia	2012-05-28	So fifteen minutes instead of ten and there'd be no complaining?  Then that seems like a petty complaint.Seems like this thread is the perfect place for my petty SanSan complaints, don't you think? /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
1678	Grail King	2012-05-28	The problem with Sansa's scenes in this episode is that she a)implied that she was praying for Tyrion's death (a departure from the books, where she prayed for his safety at this point, adding him as last when she prayed in the sept) and b)that non-book readers will not understand why she refused to escape with Sandor. Especially when it comes out that Sandor indeed escaped and Sansa is still stuck as a captive, next week. Right now, quite a few people watching the show think she actually went along.

The whitewashing of Tyrion however will be difficult for Sansa's arc next season, although I like that they seem to have set up him admiring her and her making it absolutely clear she sees him as a Lannister.Also at least one other scene between them would have set the storyline up better. An exposition on his background or fear of fire, would have helped. Or the "dog will die for you but never lie to you line".It is frustrating to see your favourite storyline basically disappear, but then compared with what they have done to Cat and Robb and Dany and Jon etc. it is not so bad. To be honest compared to the  train wreck that is Robb / Talissa it is not bad.
1680	Fragile Bird	2012-05-28	Once again, as usual, outta Likes.  Rapsie and Grail King, I'm talking to you!
1681	Feather Crystal	2012-05-28	I never "saw" the Sansa and Sandor interaction in the books as a "romance" like the San/San fans have. I would be disgusted if they end up together, because the origins were not the foundation for a healthy relationship. I am hoping that GRRM's portrayal of the scene in the tv version last night was deliberate on his part to put an end to the San/San speculations.
1682	Wouter	2012-05-28	As far as Tyrion, he's a two edge sword, yes he's kinder, but he's a Lannister and Sansa stated she will teach her children to hate Lannisters, and don't forget the surrounded by lions statement which Tyrion did hear, he's aware she hates him because he's a lannister.Sansa doesn't actually hate Tyrion in the books though - certainly not at this point (later on she is ambiguous about him and no doubt there are times she hated him, like right during the wedding for example). Moreover, in the books at least Tyrion says in public (with her present) that he won't agree to a prisoner swap on Robb's terms and that the way she is treated will depend on Robb's action. Considering how Sansa is being treated by the Lannisters, with lots of beatings, this wasn't a nice thing to say even though Tyrion feels some guilt about it (but Sansa cannot read his thoughts) and he actually stops the worst beating. In the books, Tyrion wasn't all that nice to Sansa but she still feels gratitude enough for his few kindnesses that she prays for him to survive (after a bit of hesitation maybe). In the show Tyrion seems very nice to Sansa throughout (OK, he still fights for the wrong side but personally he has been very nice to her) but yet Sansa seems to lump him in with Joffrey in her prayers, by her own admission.I guess they are preparing the ground for their situation later, but this way it risks being seen as mostly Sansa's fault. I hope they at least keep it so that he doesn't give her warning in advance; it's important to understand her reaction, that she is ambushed completely by all the Lannisters without any regards for her feelings whatsover - including by Tyrion.
1683	Maroucia	2012-05-28	As far as Tyrion, he's a two edge sword, yes he's kinder, but he's a Lannister and Sansa stated she will teach her children to hate Lannisters, and don't forget the surrounded by lions statement which Tyrion did hear, he's aware she hates him because he's a lannister.I started explained to my wife the scene about leaving with Sandor and his demeanor and she stated just the way he tells Sansa how he likes killing and other issues she wouldn't go with him either and even though a dog won't lie to you lots of dogs will turn on you.My wife doesn't read the book, but understood the attraction she called it a Fatal Attraction.I'm glad to hear your wife's thoughts about that scene. It's great to see how those things are perceived by non-readers since they don't have the same expectations than we do. I hope most people will end up with the same analysis than your spouse, but I doubt it, especially for the why didn't she go with him? part...For my part, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m slowly going down the rage/disappointment high that I was on since yesterday. I have watched the bedroom scene again, and itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not that bad, I can now start to appreciate it. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just a thousand leagues from the book version of it.Still, I agree with other posters that it could have been way worst than it is.

1685	Raksha the Demon	2012-05-28	I don't think SanSan is definitely dead, but the TV version of it lacks the punch of their relationship in the book, which was compelling, if not sensible or age-appropriate.  The show got it right three times - when Sandor helps Sansa and prevents her from killing Joffrey at the end of Season One, when he verbally tag-teams with her against Joffrey to save Ser Dontos, and when he saves her from the rapists during the riot.  They set up his concern for Sansa, and, it seems to me, his attraction to her; but not the complete depth of the characters' connection; that she touches him physically and emotionally and actually brings him to tears with her song.  Maybe if the writers had cut out Tyrion's chat with Varys, they could have shown that last night.  I don't know that the "Blackwater" treatment of SanSan portends much for the future of the characters' relationship in the books, though; considering the changes in other characters' motives and personality and action.  The SanSan in Season 2 could have been worse (Robb/Talisa, shudder).
1686	Aslerys	2012-05-28	Ok this might be a silly question but are you sure that this is the last time they see each other?
I read the books and I know that the bedroom scene is the last time they were together but I could swear that I saw a picture where Sandor is pushing Sansa against the wall in the stairs outside her bedroom, she is looking really scared and he seems to be very angry and I don't remember to see this in the show...
But maybe it was a deleted scene or something...

Exactly - and exactly why I was upset that they gave LF the role of telling Sansa how Sandor's face was burned.  If they had kept that scene between Sandor and Sansa, I think the relationship would be much stronger than what it is now.

You don't say "Fuck the king" to his face and then hang around.ETA:  And especially not when Tywin Lannister rides into town and wins the day.

For example, I myself don't see a shred of romantic insinuation between Sansa & the Hound.  She's terrified of him, but on some level, she is able to recognize him as protection.  In the future, she thinks of him at times when she feels threatened...times when she'd be happy for his protection.  She knows he's a dangerous killer, but also believes he wouldn't kill her.  And with regards to the non-kiss, she remembers his lips as being "cruel."  He left her with a "cruel" kiss and a bloody cloak - - hardly the stuff of romance.I believe Sansa romanticizes that moment (invents the memory of a kiss) because she needs to cling to the dying remnants of her girlish ideals about knights swooping in and saving ladies.  The Hound came drunkenly and forcefully at her, threatened her with a knife, but at his core, he wouldn't have hurt her and was trying to help her.  That's what she believes, though that doesn't stop her from inventing the memory of a "cruel" kiss.  I think that word is pretty significant.  She could have remembered it being surprisingly gentle, or even surprisingly passionate; instead, she took the scary route.  That kiss, nor the Hound, isn't something she'd be longing for, IMO.The Hound, on the other hand, later regrets not raping her that night.  Had he gone through with that atrocity, I wonder how different Sansa's memories would have been.That night Sansa scarcely slept at all, but tossed and turned just as she had aboard the Merling King. She dreamt of Joffrey dying, but as he clawed her at his throat and the blood ran down her fingers she saw with horror that it was her brother Robb. And she dreamed of her wedding night too, of Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s eyes devouring her as she undressed. Only then he was bigger than Tyrion had any right to be, and when he crawled into bed his face was scarred only on one side. â<U+0080><U+009C>Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll have a song from you,â<U+0080><U+009D> he rasped, and Sansa woke and found the old blind dog beside her once again. â<U+0080><U+009C>I wish you were Lady,â<U+0080><U+009D> she said.This dream speaks volumes, IMO, as to Sansa's views of the Hound.  She dreams of Joffrey dying then morphing into Robb dying; quite a horror.  She dreams of Tyrion (an undesirable) climbing into her bed; he morphs into the Hound and she wakes immediately.  Had that part of her dream been something she'd have wanted to continue, I don't think she'd have awaken.  For instance, had Tyrion morphed into Ser Loras, her unconscious mind may have allowed the dream to continue on a little longer.  It would have been pleasant, as Ser Loras was someone she's attracted to. But it was a disturbing dream all around, and the Hound's appearance was the breaking point, which caused her to wake up.

1690	Grail King	2012-05-28	I was disappointed that they are given Sandors line about lairs to LF, but than I can see it if he's also going to be the new protector of her, hope it comes back and bites LF in the ass.

Yes, this is not the stuff of "romance" - if by that you mean the girl meets the handsome prince and he's wonderful and sweet and they fall madly in love. Isn't that what Sansa's whole arc has to been getting her to see the folly of? She's a long way past romanticizing these kinds of men: that's why she can no longer have fantasies about Loras Tyrell. She's facing the truth about Sandor, in that yeah, he's not a "nice man" and he's probably a man who would kiss a woman harshly, but it doesn't negate the fact that she is thinking about it and romanticizing it. She almost sounds bitter in that scene because he took something from her and has no left her with very little.I believe Sansa romanticizes that moment (invents the memory of a kiss) because she needs to cling to the dying remnants of her girlish ideals about knights swooping in and saving ladies.

Had he gone through with that atrocity, I wonder how different Sansa's memories would have been.Now you've entered the realm of pure make believe. He never regretted not raping her. He regrets leaving her to suffer with the Lannisters, and the indignity of being married to Tyrion. That is what he regrets. I would suggest a closer reading of the scene again? Or perhaps the link that Lyanna Stark was so gracious to provide? Or maybe the From Pawn to Player Sansa re-read threads?This dream speaks volumes, IMO, as to Sansa's views of the Hound.  She dreams of Joffrey dying then morphing into Robb dying; quite a horror.  She dreams of Tyrion (an undesirable) climbing into her bed; he morphs into the Hound and she wakes immediately.

But it was a disturbing dream all around, and the Hound's appearance was the breaking point, which caused her to wake up.The dream is ambiguous, but your interpretation makes little sense when we actually put the dream into the context of what we learn later on in AFFC. When Randa Royce asks her if she knows what goes on in the marriage bed, she thinks of Sandor. We have her thinking that he kissed her as well, and consciously rejecting a fantasy of Loras Tyrell. This equates to a really suggestive possibility that her dream was indeed an erotic one about the Hound. As for her waking up directly afterwards, don't you know Martin is the biggest troll? He isn't going to give away all his goodies in one go.

1693	Dracarya	2012-05-28	I noticed that as well.  It was as if George was trying to say he intended more of a daughter-ish/protector role as the core of their relationship...not a romantic one.  He is drawn to her innocence, he wants to protect her, but it's not a sexual attraction.I always thought Sansa later remembering a kiss that never happened was just her childish tendency to romanticize everything trying hard to stay alive.  She's terrified of the Hound and in no way attracted to him, yet she recalls him kissing her?  Sounds like a random firing out of one of her beloved songs about Knights saving Ladies. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />

1694	LÂ<U+0092>Age dÂ<U+0092>or	2012-05-28	They are trying to ease up on Hound's sick shit since they don't have much time to make him sympathetic gradually, it seems to me the show likes to further develop this misunderstood rabid dog theme around Sandor. I was waiting for the forced song though...
1695	Woman of War	2012-05-28	Thank you for the link, jon's nissa. After reading this I had the distinct feeling that at some points or in some aspects Sandor did for Sansa, albeit in a cruel wretched way, what Ned should have done. Education about the life as it is.
1696	Lyanna Stark	2012-05-28	And the source material proves...what, exactly?Different interpretations run rampant in a series like this.  For example, I myself don't see a shred of romantic insinuation between Sansa & the Hound.  She's terrified of him, but on some level, she is able to recognize him as protection.  In the future, she thinks of him at times when she feels threatened...times when she'd be happy for his protection.  She knows he's a dangerous killer, but also believes he wouldn't kill her.No, she thinks of him in every single chapter. Just finished a reread, it's right there on the pages. Sure, you can argue that it's not transforming into something else, but that seems like personal prejudice since the text indicates otherwise, whether we like it or not. (For the record, I don't think he's amazing or 100% suitable either, but I don't argue with the text.)And with regards to the non-kiss, she remembers his lips as being "cruel."  He left her with a "cruel" kiss and a bloody cloak - - hardly the stuff of romance.Never said romance, but she clearly feels something for him, if you add up all the details. For instance the ones in my linked post. Like the one where Myranda Royce talks about marriage beds and having sex and she thinks of first Tyrion and then Sandor and agrees that she knows what goes on. What is your explanation for that? It comes completely out of left field.I believe Sansa romanticizes that moment (invents the memory of a kiss) because she needs to cling to the dying remnants of her girlish ideals about knights swooping in and saving ladies.  The Hound came drunkenly and forcefully at her, threatened her with a knife, but at his core, he wouldn't have hurt her and was trying to help her.  That's what she believes, though that doesn't stop her from inventing the memory of a "cruel" kiss.  I think that word is pretty significant.  She could have remembered it being surprisingly gentle, or even surprisingly passionate; instead, she took the scary route.  That kiss, nor the Hound, isn't something she'd be longing for, IMO.No, because her specifically wishing later on that he was there is in fact not her wishing that he was there....or? She compares almost every other man she meets to him, from Ser Loras, to Dontos, to Tyrion, Lothor Brune, Bronze Yohn Royce etc.I don't understand why you think she ought to have remembered it as being gentle when it wasn't. The point is, she's whitewashing events, he is whitewashing events separately while with Arya and they're both spending some significant time thinking about each other. In the text.The Hound, on the other hand, later regrets not raping her that night.  Had he gone through with that atrocity, I wonder how different Sansa's memories would have been.My goodness. People do need to learn to read, especially to really read the word "BEFORE" as in "before leaving her to the imp", i.e. "anything including murder would have been better than leaving her for the imp". As he's also wishing Arya to kill him at the time, he's going to be suitably dramatic to get her to stab him. But as we know, she does not.Also, if he is regretting not raping her, that means people actually think his plan was to rape her, so the plan then was 1. rape her. 2. offer escape from KL 3. ??  4. profit. Brilliant plan?This dream speaks volumes, IMO, as to Sansa's views of the Hound.  She dreams of Joffrey dying then morphing into Robb dying; quite a horror.  She dreams of Tyrion (an undesirable) climbing into her bed; he morphs into the Hound and she wakes immediately.

It would have been pleasant, as Ser Loras was someone she's attracted to. But it was a disturbing dream all around, and the Hound's appearance was the breaking point, which caused her to wake up.Sure, you continue to think that, but in that case, answer me this: Myranda Royce's comment later in AFFC, runs like this:"I do need another husband, I had one once, but I killed him.""You did?" Alayne said, shocked."Oh yes. He died on top of me. In me, if truth be told. You do know what goes on in a marriage bed, I hope?"She thought of Tyrion, and of the Hound and how he'd kissed her, and gave a nod.Now, on its own, I'd say the dream is ambiguous. Add it up with the Sweetrobin kiss and the section above, plus that Sansa seems to think of Sandor in a generally positive light as of AFFC and you have....? Sure, you can deny it, I mean people deny that Jon is the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar as well, but that doesn't mean it makes sense based on the text.

But I cannot deny that it's there, any more than I feel I can deny that Aegon is fake or that Jon is the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar.It's not a question about liking it or not liking it, as if I'd had my way, Aegon would NOT be fake, for instance. I was devastated that he is.The thing is, Sansa does turn it into a memory of a kiss and she does think positively about him once they are separated. I'm not making this up either, since my SO picked up on it much faster than I did the first time he read the novels.
1698	WetHair	2012-05-28	In one of GRRM's interviews or comments at a conference (which I now can't find to link to) he said that he thought The Hound WAS loved. He didn't say specifically by Sansa but she is the only person to fit the bill other than perhaps his parents, but I very much doubt that was who he was alluding to. It made me feel happier for him.

He didn't say specifically by Sansa but she is the only person to fit the bill other than perhaps his parents, but I very much doubt that was who he was alluding to. It made me feel happier for him.I think I remember what you are referring to, and I thought that maybe he was referring to the readers of the series--that perhaps he was surprised at how much people liked him. BUT I could be remembering something completely different all together. I probably am.Hah, this seems to be an extremely touchy thing. The romantic in me has suffered massive blows throughout the entire series so I find myself extremely skeptical of a "happily ever after" between these two (or anyone else for that matter). I'm curious to see how her scenes will play out later on when she does start to think of him often, or if they will just dismiss it entirely. Time will tell.I do NOT think that GRRM was using this episode to squander anyone's thoughts of the Sandor and Sansa relationship (whatever it is), he was simply using what he had to work with. We didn't get the song because it was never mentioned prior. Fair enough. Otherwise, the Sandor scenes in this episode were top notch, I'm so happy that he got some screen time, and Rory McCann was just awesome. Love that guy.

People are going to interpret things differently, that's the nature of fiction.
1701	Rapsie	2012-05-28	Finally seen the episode. Given all the cuts, if the scene was important for later in the story, why include it at all? If they never interact again, then the scene was unnecessary. Oh well, we shall see: if either the cloak or the Unkiss appear in Season 3 it may still signify something be it protector or Direwolf replacement or just weird WFT moment for those who haven't read the books.

========================================================================================================================
What's to say yours is the correct interpretation? Or someone else is wrong?
I think Sansa is having subconsciously an infatuation with Sandor, he is the closest thing to her ideal of a Knight in KL, he shows he cares for her but I think more as the sister he lost in his childhood or a daughter he feels he never could have because of his disfigurement and the known perception of him in Westeros.
These are two of my favorite characters, but I look at it from a different point of view then most of the fan base here, I may be utterly wrong but I'll have to wait for George to finish this story
PS to George:
Please before I / we bite the dust.
1703	zuziako	2012-05-28	As someone said, there are no "wrong" interpretations, but you can always deny the obvious or over-interpret and be happy with yourself. As much as inappropriate Sansa-Sandor relationship may be, it's still there. At one point Sansa wants to fantasize about Loras and ends up thinking about Sandor, there are situations in which she wishes for him and compares other to him (Lyanna pointed to citations earlier). No matter how you want to see it points to affection that's connected with romance.
I guess what some fans might be unhappy about is how suddenly important this relationship became in the fandom, when, truth be told, is not the most important plot line. Well, no duh, but hell, it's the perfect fiction romance. Contrasted, inappropriate and yet at the same time fitting, with both hope and doom in store.

1706	Dornish Hen	2012-05-28	When Sansa dropped the doll, I took it to mean that all of her child-like notions are falling down around her also.  She's just realized that The Hound would never hurt her, and what that means to her.  Everything she's thought about knights and chivalry she just realized are in The Hound.  (Series Hound, that is.)  Between a drunk Cercei and a nice Hound, Sansa just got her world rocked!
I too am rereading the series and I found it very interesting when Lothor Brune saved her from Marrillion, she immediately thought he was The Hound there to save her.  (That's as far as I've gotten.  I know there are more instances!)  I'm hoping that next season the writers will invent the "memories" or "visions" for Sansa so that the relationship (or whatever you'd like to call it) will continue on screen.  
A girl can hope that a thing will happen!!!
1707	Ran	2012-05-28	By the costuming, I'd take it that this was an alternative shoo of the ep 8 (or maybe 7) scene where Sansa thanks him and the Hound does his thing. Differnt location, and they seem to have been directing more intensity. Why they changed it to what we eventually had on screen, I couldn't say.

I'd love to get my hands on that version of the scene somehow! /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
1709	Caro99	2012-05-28	i think that pic is from a deleted scene in episode 3. the dress and hair are the same from her dinner with cersei, so maybe it could have happened between dinner and shae'shandmaiden intro?? but if what ran said is true then it makes me a little sad we could have had that scene which look quite faithfull to the books regardless of how much i love the scene in episode 7 where she thanks him...i'm sorry if i got the name wrong, but i think leia a few pages back said how maybe sansa will end up as a queen, and well sandor just doesn't seem the sort of guy men would want as their king consort (however much i think they would love their kind and gentle queen) but sansa being a queen can still allow her to keep sandor as her paramour one day /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />and someone metioned this before, whichi hadn't thought about and it's brilliant- the cloak sandor gave her back on episode 4!!! maybe there is indeed a chance of seeing her wrap herself in his cloak either next week or in S3!! yes /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />Hopefully we will get to see sansa thinking about sandor at least once one day on the show. But even if it happens, to the people who havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t read the books it will still come out so unlike the books L they may think she is regretting the lost opportunity of not accepting his offer cause of the winterfell promise, rather than because he just has a special place in her thoughts and hearts, like in the books. Winterfell was not promised there, only maybe the north and then maybe riverrun or the vale or something, so itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s nice to read sansa thinking of sandor cause of himself rather than of him as a tool to go home (sort of like sandor wanting sansa for herself, not her claim to winterfell and the north) /wub.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':wub:' />

1711	David Selig	2012-05-28	It doesn't mean anything, the show is different from the books. And it's not up to Martin to change the general direction where it's going according to the showrunners. If they don't plan for SanSan, it's their call.

Im not sorry for calling them MALES and making seemingly sexist remarks about the producers......(btw, in case anyone missed it, they actually are men. really...they are...oh and they are obviously straight men as they like naked women)
why?
because I am sulking (still) over all the wasted precious minutes for 2 seasons spent on watching Ros have sex.....
on....oh wait.....Ros is having sex...again! Look....ros is naked....oh wait...ros is beating the naked whore in the bed....look ros is crying to LF.....
Oh look.....now Robb is having sex and we get to see endless minutes on Talissa....did you miss her naked butt?  oh look....we get a closeup....oh wait...ygritte is making lame sex jokes to jon!  20 mins of them running thru the snow.....
if you go back and add up all the wasted time spend on gratuitous NUDE women having.....sex.....
and think of all that time being dedicated to character development and storyline...(not just sansan but other characters as well)
it makes me sad so I stand by my remarks about them.....grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

1720	Maroucia	2012-05-28	There is a whole lot of sex in the books, but if you look at the overall percentage of it, it's certainly not as high in the books as it is in the show.

1722	Juliads	2012-05-28	I have not read the books, I dont particularly care what type of bond or relationship the hound had with sansa, but I do feel disappointed that the viewers may never see them in a scene together again.  That seems like bad planning.
Throughout season one and two it felt apparent that something would develop between them, we were given moments where this cold harsh man was uncharacteristically kind and compassionate towards Sansa.  I assumed that towards the end something would be revealed.
Either he related to her abuse from Joffrey, or he viewed her in some daughterly fashion or he really did have romantic feelings towards her, etc.
Perhaps his character was different in the books, maybe more cruel, but i have no clue as to why Sansa didnt accompany him out of the Castle, that was probably her only chance to escape.  Silly girl.
Even if this is the last we see of them together, i do hope we will get more Sandor, that actor is brilliant, The last few episodes i was always anticipating his scenes, as infrequent as they were....

1723	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-05-28	Well......as a wrap up for myself....I was naturally disappointed in the SanSanness of the season but I am also disappointed in MANY dropped character/storylines so far.  Im still trying to wrap my head around Tywin/Arya vs Roose/Arya, for example.
the whole wasted Robb love scenes....to me took up too much time and didnt much add anything (for me, anyways).  I'm still WTF to Talisia, Talisa, Talissa...who-cares-who-she-is........
But, to be kind, I AM grateful they showed us anything at all.  I actually do like Rory McCann *drool* and ok so im the oddball but I kinda preferred his quieter portrayal of Sandor vs the uber emo teenager snarling all the time in the books.  I thought he did a wonderful, emotional scene in the middle of the battlefield when he "lost his belly for fighting".  That scene wasn't in the books as he isn't a POV, so it was nice to see it.
I think Sophie Turner is a beautiful Sansa.

I had tried to watch Season 1 on TV, but every time I turned on the series some naked woman was being fucked by someone, and it didn't seem all that interesting.  And there was a character that was a dwarf, and it seemed such a cheap stunt.  "Hey, let's add some eyecatching stuff, naked women and dwarves".  But having read SF and historical novels for over 30 years, I finally picked up the damn book.  Thank God I didn't have to wait years for the next book, 5 at once, lol!  Then the dvds came out, and I watched those.So after all that, season 2 has been very disappointing in some of the episodes.  Ros.  Half an episode in chit chat between Jon and Ygritte.  There wasn't a better way to use the meagre amount of time?  But even though on one hand I agree your comment was sexist, sadly, it was true, lol.

I also suggest you to read the books, they're reallyyyy goooood!!!!!

1732	Feather Crystal	2012-05-29	Dislike it all you like, but read what's actually in the book before you're having a fit. I linked the actual book quotes some pages back, but I guess I need to link them again since people have all sorts of odd notions about this.How about this for some actual source material instead of baseless speculation?It's insulting to suggest that I haven't read the books if I have a different opinion than you. I have read them...twice actually.And the source material proves...what, exactly?Different interpretations run rampant in a series like this.  For example, I myself don't see a shred of romantic insinuation between Sansa & the Hound.  She's terrified of him, but on some level, she is able to recognize him as protection.  In the future, she thinks of him at times when she feels threatened...times when she'd be happy for his protection.  She knows he's a dangerous killer, but also believes he wouldn't kill her.  And with regards to the non-kiss, she remembers his lips as being "cruel."  He left her with a "cruel" kiss and a bloody cloak - - hardly the stuff of romance.I believe Sansa romanticizes that moment (invents the memory of a kiss) because she needs to cling to the dying remnants of her girlish ideals about knights swooping in and saving ladies.  The Hound came drunkenly and forcefully at her, threatened her with a knife, but at his core, he wouldn't have hurt her and was trying to help her.  That's what she believes, though that doesn't stop her from inventing the memory of a "cruel" kiss.  I think that word is pretty significant.  She could have remembered it being surprisingly gentle, or even surprisingly passionate; instead, she took the scary route.  That kiss, nor the Hound, isn't something she'd be longing for, IMO.The Hound, on the other hand, later regrets not raping her that night.  Had he gone through with that atrocity, I wonder how different Sansa's memories would have been.This dream speaks volumes, IMO, as to Sansa's views of the Hound.  She dreams of Joffrey dying then morphing into Robb dying; quite a horror.  She dreams of Tyrion (an undesirable) climbing into her bed; he morphs into the Hound and she wakes immediately.  Had that part of her dream been something she'd have wanted to continue, I don't think she'd have awaken.  For instance, had Tyrion morphed into Ser Loras, her unconscious mind may have allowed the dream to continue on a little longer.  It would have been pleasant, as Ser Loras was someone she's attracted to. But it was a disturbing dream all around, and the Hound's appearance was the breaking point, which caused her to wake up.Thank you! I agree! /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' /> /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' /> If I had a dollar for everytime someone interpreted this relationship wrong... well...

The purple wedding is a perfect example of it, who sent the killer after Bran another.Also, she never said she was the only one who knows it, just that she has determined based on what is written what she believes it to be.

He doesn't spell out in big letters, but he does give enough information that for the vast majority of "questions", there is one right answer.  The purple wedding is a perfect example of it, who sent the killer after Bran another.I don't see the Sandor/Sansa romance question as having one right answer however. For my part I see their relationship as being mainly about the learning experience they both get from it. Sansa learning more about the harsh realities of life and Sandor, that not everything he sees as weak or innocent is to be pitied or despised. Again with Sansa's later thoughts about Sandor. She is a young girl going through a period of her life that I would imagine is confusing for any young girl. Add in to that all that she has endured and that Sandor, in a wierd way, is probably the person she has been most intimate with for quite some time and the fact that he often appears unbidden as the subject of her thoughts could mean absolutely nothing in the longer term. Or they could indicate some serious romantic feelings. You pay your money and take your choice.Also, she never said she was the only one who knows it, just that she has determined based on what is written what she believes it to be. Stating what you believe and telling someone they are wrong for believing differently are two different things.

1741	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-05-29	Nope...you are WRONG!  wrong i tell you.....
who am I talking to?  meh.....pick someone LOL
ok....seriously.... /mellow.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':mellow:' />
Shae's purpose seems to be two-fold:  to give the actress screen time and to provide a "sounding board" for Sansa as no one wants to read "Sansa thought.......this.........." with much of her storyline being internal.
Perhaps they will have some girl talk about the Hound
1742	Independent George	2012-05-29	i keep hoping Drogo will get the late night munchies and eat Dany....but nope......Hey, considering all of Doreah's lessons to Dany; how do we know that he didn't? Har!/duck and cover.

yea yea i meant Drogon.....dang typo.....
1744	Fragile Bird	2012-05-29	Hey, considering all of Doreah's lessons to Dany; how do we know that he didn't?/duck and cover. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />	 Stay on topic, she said, sternly.  /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' />
1745	Valkyrja	2012-05-29	Speaking of said topic, I just read YET ANOTHER review of the episode by a non-book-reader, and they were convinced that Sansa was going to run off with the Hound and have a love-affair together.......this person's observation was based solely on the tiny bit of San/San screen time in the tv series.
I'm not saying that means *anything* whatsoever, other than that 'it' (whatever 'it' is) has obviously caught the attention of those who have not read the books, and will most likely perplex these viewers when Sandor and Sansa don't interact again. (Or....at least not yet. /leer.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':leer:' /> )
Again.....my question is......after this episode (which otherwise seemed to demonstrate some 'growth' from Tv-Sansa), how are they going to explain why she didn't leave with him? A converstation with Shae? Whatever it may be, I hope it doesn't involve Littlefinger.  Hmmph. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
1746	Tharvot	2012-05-29	Nah, the episode did not kill the San/San idea in any way.  It was modified from what was in the book, sure, but the meeting was still there.  
There is clear importance to the meeting.  It revealed that not only was the Hound through with his loyalty to the Lannisters, but it also revealed that he had some sort of feelings for Sansa...whether those feelings were protective or emotional in nature is not revealed.
Sansa can very easily "misremember" the events as she did in the books, she could well fantasize about them too.  The Blackwater episode did not do a whole lot to enhance their relationship, but it did not wipe out the possibility of it either.  The fact that the season included most Sandor and Sansa interactions should speak volumes towards the importance of their perceived relationship going forward.
1747	Woman of War	2012-05-29	Again.....my question is......after this episode (which otherwise seemed to demonstrate some 'growth' from Tv-Sansa), how are they going to explain why she didn't leave with him?The growth of tv Sansa is the explanation: she was not so willing anymore to to as she was told, not if she was not convinced. And Sandor with his drunk behavior did not inspire trust, the more mature episode 9  Sansa had an opinion she was willing to defend ( finally - the girl is growing up - thank you HBO!).

I don't think TV or book - Sansa should have gone with the Hound either. But I guess I just wonder if they will bother to explain something like this to the TV audience or not....I'm sure there will still be those who say she is stupid, no matter what explanations are or are not given. Just like there are those book readers who insist Sansa is stupid, even in her later chapters.Of course, neither TV or Book Sansa is stupid.....she is a survivor, imo. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

The Blackwater episode did not do a whole lot to enhance their relationship, but it did not wipe out the possibility of it either.  The fact that the season included most Sandor and Sansa interactions should speak volumes towards the importance of their perceived relationship going forward.I agree that the TV episode did not kill 'San/San' for me. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Nevertheless, I think that I need to be much more clear about what *I* mean by the term 'San/San'. I know that in 'fandom' (whatever that is) the 'slash' thing is used to denote a hoped-for romantic relationship between two characters. This is not how I am using it, personally. I don't even really like the term myself. I've been using 'San/San' because everyone else seems to use it and its easier to type than 'Sansa and Sandor's strangely compelling connection with each other that could or could not develop into something more for both of them but probably won't be ever be acted upon and may not ever come up again in the series even though it would be nice to have some resolution on the subject'. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />I just wanted to be clear that when I am answering the question 'Is San/San dead?' and I say HELLS NO!!!!, that I mean that the Blackwater episode by no means shows that Sandor and Sansa will never meet again. If anything, its inclusion in the series at all (even as 'just' a 'mentor/protector' type relationship), still could mean that they will, at the very least, meet up again someday.For me, it would still be 'San/San' even if they never meet up again, or if they do meet up again but don't have a romantic relationship (which they mostly won't), or if they even meet up again and are somehow involved with each other's deaths! Just like, for me, I still like 'Jaime/Brienne' , even if it is never romantic and nothing of the sort happens.Trying to explain this fully is difficult. I am just getting tired of the disdain and disgust from San/San-haters who seem to think that if you appreciate the Sansa/Sandor interactions in anyway, and if you had wished and hoped to see them accurately put on-screen, that it means you are some rabid tween fangirl type who sits around drawing Sandor as a bishounen all day and has an unrealistic grasp on the world of ASoIaF and the probability of 'romance' therein. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />

I don't want to spoil anything for you, but if the tv series follows the books AT ALL in the next season(s), then we will have not seen the last of the Hound. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
1752	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-05-29	Rory McCann  /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' /> /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />
1753	Caro99	2012-05-29	yeah can't wait to see rory next season! /wub.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':wub:' />  and yeah, the moments between arya and the hound are quite incredibly funny and deep, but i'm going to be a little teary-eyed for only getting to see sandor with arya, instea dof him with the little bird, who will in turn be with tyrion and LF...
i asked a friend who hasn't read the books if he thought sansa had rejected the hound, and he told me that the way he got it, sandor just left too quickly after he assured her he wouldn't hurt her. that if he had stayed 2 minutes more or something, she would've made her mind to go with him..
there's been some speculation about the show turning sansa's internal monologues into conversations with shae, and that maybe we will see sansa telling shae about the un-kiss moment and that she ought to have gone with the hound... & well, while i have loved all the sansa/shae moments the show came up with, and i think it will be bittersweet to watch this friendship fall apart due to tyrion aand sansa getting married, I do not want sansa to tell shae about the hound and her. even if in the show it's much lighter stuff than in the books, the odd connection that happened between them is compelling cause no one in westeros expects to see the lannister's dog and ned stark's pretty daughter forming a bond of sorts. if shae know, well i think i would view her as as intruder to san/san. these 2 haven't even consioucly realized they may be thinking a little too much of the other, so if we see in S3 a jealous shae (she has to get jealous in order for the show to set up her betrayal to tyrion) telling tyrion about sandor and sansa to make him jealous in return, and even worse, she could tell cersei and tywin when they threaten her after joff's death,it's all going to loose so much more of the beauty of the san/san connection..
i guess that if the show can't come up with anything more than conversations with shae about sandor in oder for onlt show viewers to get sansa misses the hound, i'll jjust have to wait and see how they deal with it to see if i would have a chang of heart about this.
 another thing that has been mentioned is if whether or not sansa and sandor will have a romantic vibe to them if george decides to have them thrown together again... i actually do think that if sansa and sandor meet again something romantic is bound to happen. it can only be a kiss or him dying for her, but i can't see them just recalling what they lived in KL in the past and then walking on their own separate directions. they've made a deep impression on the other that cannot just be forgotten or ignored when and if they ever meet again.
1754	Fragile Bird	2012-05-29	I thought that was well said, Caro99.  I agree with your analysis about not wanting Sansa to have a chat with Shae.  Cringe worthy.
1755	Maroucia	2012-05-29	Speaking of said topic, I just read YET ANOTHER review of the episode by a non-book-reader, and they were convinced that Sansa was going to run off with the Hound and have a love-affair together.......this person's observation was based solely on the tiny bit of San/San screen time in the tv series.I'm not saying that means *anything* whatsoever, other than that 'it' (whatever 'it' is) has obviously caught the attention of those who have not read the books, and will most likely perplex these viewers when Sandor and Sansa don't interact again.

1756	Maroucia	2012-05-30	I agree with you guys that a chat about the Hound between Sansa and Shae could kill some of the appeal of the secret bound that Sansa and Sandor share together, but I also wonder how else could the show be able to demonstrate the fact that Sansa misses the Hound and has some regrets about not following him out of the city.If Sansa tells Shae that the Hound went to her room on the night of the battle to offer her to flee with him, it wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be that bad. This would be ok to me, but only for that specific matter, I would hate it if Sansa would start to talk of Sandor all the time to Shae! /stillsick.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':stillsick:' />The worst scenario, to me, would be one that would involve not even a single hint that Sansa still thinks of the Hound.Now that would kill me!!!  /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />Anyway, in the long terms, Shae is going to get killed, her knowledge of Sandorâ<U+0080><U+0099>s interest in Sansa would die with her.
1757	zuziako	2012-05-30	I agree with you guys that a chat about the Hound between Sansa and Shae could kill some of the appeal of the secret bound that Sansa and Sandor share together, but I also wonder how else could the show be able to demonstrate the fact that Sansa misses the Hound and has some regrets about not following him out of the city.She huddles in his cloak. Maybe a dream sequence?
1758	The Anti-Targ	2012-05-30	Well given in the books to dat the last scene between them in CoK is the last they see of each other I imagine SanSan is pretty well dead.
If Sandor is still alive there's a possibility that he'll hook back up with Sansa and become a devoted dog once more, but with an owner who has genuine affection for him. However Sandor's fated to die while putting his unBrother down methinks.
1759	Ghosteline	2012-05-30	Since there were so many people here arguing how to interpret SanSan relationship and if Sandor felt the need to simply protect or was there more.... well if you read from the third book how Sandor remembers Sansa, then Im pretty sure theres way more chemistry there.
AND BEWARE HERE COMES A SPOILER! (sorry I don't know how to hide a spoiler /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' /> )
When The Hound is badly insured and is about to die (well we don't know if he did die or not).. and he asks Arya to kill him... he also begins to blabber about some things he did in the past... and he also starts to sob and I can't remember exacty what he says about Sansa, but it's something like this: "I was just standing there and watched her getting beaten. She never gave me the song, I took the song from her. I meant to take her too, I should have. I should have fucked her before leaving her to that Imp."
Well sure he's is in a pretty bad shape at that moment, when his ready to die. But in my opinion theres more to that relationship.
And I also hate when people worry too much about the age gap. I mean you can't compare SoIaF world to our modern world. In SoIaF almost all the relationships are quite messy and don't quite seem to work together. So I think their chemistry fits very well to this world and I do hope they will meet again in further books.
1760	SerMixalot	2012-05-30	watched the google author interview with GRRM and he put it nicely, in his medieval setting, there is no adolescence. you are either a child or a woman (or man), so in that sense these sexual type relations make more sense (though obviously creepy withour modern sensibilities)
1761	Kittykatknits	2012-05-30	I wasn't sure about Shae in season one but she's really grown on me. I understand about wanting to keep her connection a secret but talking to Shae is one of the few methods that can be used to get her feelings across on a tv show. Sansa could say she missed her only chance or something similar without actually using his name. Or, she could wrap herself in his cloak at another point. But otherwise, not sure what can be done.
I still don't think SanSan is dead. In fact, the more I re-watch the scene, the better I feel about it.

They just need to show that she is thinking of him!

But, I can completely understand why you would not want that to happen.Regarding SanSan, I read something elsewhere that really changed my perception of the scene between them in Sunday's episode.

I have now accepted the changes HBO made, even though I'm not entirely satisfied with them.Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve finally watched the episode in its whole yesterday, and I really liked it! Sandor had a lot of screen time, which I obliviously appreciated, and the battle was great even though I pictured it with way more wildfire, but I guess it would have been too complicated and expensive for HBO to do it this way. Also, this episode really made me love Stannis who was such a badass in it!My biggest complaint after the SanSan changes is that Tyrion didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t loose half of his nose. Only a cut on the face! /frown5.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':frown5:' /> It's not that I don't like him, but the lost of his nose is an important part of his downfall to me.But overall, it was an excellent episode.

There was no sexual undertone in the show-bedroom scene; Sandor did seem to be attracted by Sansa to some extend, but nothing more.

Someone did a comparison of the scene in the show versus the books and broke down all the symbolism and pointed out that the reason that Sansa did not go with him is because she is not ready to go yet. If you want to read the write up and I'll send you a PM telling you where to see it.I would like to hear from it also!

1768	Kittykatknits	2012-05-30	i'm not sure if it was lyanna stark who mentioned it on the sansa re-read thread, but some believe that the morning when arya leaves the hound to die is the same morning we get of sansa at the eyrie since she woke up startled with her nerves all a tingled or something like that. so if the show has these 2 scenes one after the other, it would be nice to see sansa sensed the hound's pain.I read that and I think she might be right.

1771	Caro99	2012-05-30	thanks kittykatknits! off to read it, but not before i tell maroucia that she's right- i hadn't thought off them not including him climbing into her bed since there was no bed undertone in the episode, but maybe if they go for it it would be so odd that people who have not read the books and don't like sansa, while not understanding it thoroughly, would be like, "Wow, little miss perfect is having a dream of the hound in bed!"
but if the bed isn't included i hope they can find another way to convey that she seems him as more than just a protector figure.. the un-kiss may work, but him climbing into bed is nice for me causei see it as a mature older sansa accepting sandor into her bed one day..

1773	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-05-30	OK so.....I rewatched it again and I have decided that when he says to her "No Little Bird, I wont hurt you"....he meant that he won't hurt her.....by taking her with him.
SO.....my new interpretation was that he decided that "not hurting her" meant leaving her behind, which was why he left.  He LEFT her.
basically, he withdrew the offer.
1774	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-05-30	http://www.youtube.c...&feature=relmfu
sigh
1775	Juliads	2012-05-31	question to the book readers....
After the blackwater battle, when he offers to take her and she declines, is this the last that they see of each other?
and hasn't he actually been killed in the novels, i seem to recall hearing some posters mentioning that...Does that mean we will see the last of him in S3?  Such a great character and talented actor, it would be a shame if they continue to give him abbreviated scenes then kill him off. 
and I just have to express my amusement over how many non-book viewers(i gather a growing majority) think that Sansa left with him.  I re-watched the scene, and i don't see any firm inclination that she follows him out that door.  WIshful thinking i suppose.
1776	Caro99	2012-05-31	Hmmm Christina, I think you may be on to something here. Maybe Sansa was going to go with him after she gives him that lingering beautiful look when she states he wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t hurt her. But just then Sandor realized that he shouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t make such a promise cause harm may come to her if she leaves with him (whether itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s thanks to him or for other reason), so he decided to go away. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m sure he knows staying alone in KL with Joff for company isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t safe, but maybe, since there is some sexual attraction in there, he realized he could end up being a danger to her innocence or somethingâ<U+0080>¦ but I like this theory cause it both makes Sandor a man who is willing to sacrifice his wishes for the well-being of the little bird and it also makes Sansa for non-book readers less â<U+0080><U+009C>foolishâ<U+0080><U+009D> for not going away with him.Juliads, unfortunately they donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t meet again after he leaves her room for at least the next 3 books, but there is a popular theory going around that his Hound identity died but Sandor is still alive in a sort of Westesori rehabilitation centerâ<U+0080>¦ Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not sure how much I should say if you have not read the books, but if S3 ends or includes a certain major event where he and arya are concerned, then we may very well see him in S4 as well!  Aww, poor non-book readers who think she did elope with him. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m sure that even if I had not read the books by now, I would definitely be intrigued by San/San and would be just like this lot! Lol, I mean, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve read the books more than once and I still for a moment felt convinced that the show had changed their storylines so she could run away with him. I know it was mad since it would mean a lot of important future plot changes, but until we got the preview for next week I was stunned into believing this. /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' /> silly me /blushing.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':blushing:' />

I would be able to buy a lot more aspirin for my headaches.This has to be one of the most asinine comments I have ever read anywhere. Clearly the product of someone who has a poor understanding of literature and its relationship with readers.It's impossible to even appreciate the point of view of those who believe in a pairing as outlandish as Sandor and Sansa when some of its loudest proponents are smug, self-righteous, and narrow. Reminds me of the worst sort of fans from the animated Avatar series.
1778	Valkyrja	2012-05-31	Juliads, while Sansa and Sandor have yet to meet up again in the book series, keep in mind that the book series is still unfinished at this point, so there is a chance they may meet up again. I do not believe that Sandor is dead. His persona of the Hound may be, but I feel that he is alive and in hiding. Whether or not he reappears in the story, we'll just have to see.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that neither of them have seen each other again since the night at the Blackwater, both characters in the books seem to think of one another a great deal. Sansa thinks of Sandor in almost all of her subsequent chapters, either comparing other men to him, wishing that he were still there, wrapping herself in his cloak, misremembering the night of the Blackwater until she thinks for sure that he kissed her (in the books he nearly does, so the mismemory is slightly more understandable), and finally, in her later chapters she even has a fairly risque dream (some say its a nightmare) that includes Sandor climbing into her bed. Sandor, for his part, rather frequently mentions 'the pretty little bird' that he seems to regret leaving in King's Landing.....at least, it stands out as fairly frequently, coming from him of all people.
Some say that San/San shippers just magnify the importance of such remembrances, but I say that this is clear and present in the text, and at the very least (regardless of any sexual or romantic undertones) the characters' continued thoughts about each other signify just how much the complicated 'relationship' meant to each of them.
Whether they ever meet up again or not, Sandor continues to play a part in the story after this point, so we should expect to see him around in the HBO series for at least the next season, hopefully the next two seasons. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

I thought it was rather sad and sweet when he spoke of her giving him a song with such pride. His despair when he learned of her marriage was very powerful too.I think there is a good chance we will see him for the next two seasons actually if the two big weddings are split amongst seasons as I think they will be.
1780	WinterWarrior	2012-05-31	I don't agree that he withdrew his offer. I think she refused him.
I am a big supporter of San/San and think they will get together some day and he will die protecting her or rescuing her from something at some point.
I think the HBO San/San scene that Martin wrote in "Blackwater" stands alone and should not be clouded by the book scene. I think it is totally about Sansa coming into her own and into womanhood, leaving childhood behind. She is in the middle of her first flowering, she handled being cooped up with the women during the battle better than Cersei did, she is back in her room thinking she is safe and Stannis is winning and will soon liberate her, and then there is the Hound.
Sansa stands her own, does not seem to be afraid of him after a while and says "no" to this very powerful man. He respects that and leaves. I think the fact that he does not touch her or come on to her in a sexual way empowers her to a certain extent. It is one of the few times during her captivity at KL that she can say "no" and it means something, someone powerful listens (even though the Hound is powerful in a physical way, not royal power). She lets go of her doll in that scene as she lets go of victimhood and childhood (in my opinon).
I think her words "I know you will not hurt me" speaks volumes about her sense of self and the fact that there is a bond of trust that she has with him. This is setting us up for some later San/San event in the future. I do believe he is in love with her and she is drawn to him.

1781	Valkyrja	2012-05-31	WinterWarrior, I think you make an excellent observation and a very interesting interpretation.... thank you for sharing! /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
I agree that HBO Sansa has refused the offer. It is easy to get mixed up if we think about the books here, but Book-Sansa does *not* outright refuse the Hound. Book-Hound is MUCH more emotionally unstable and incredibly drunk at this point, and from what I understand of that scene, he THINKS she is refusing the offer, and basically leaves before she really has a chance to process what has happened. I agree that they've given HBO Sansa more agency in this scene, which fits given that she is older in the show and it also fits in more with the characterization of these two characters in the show (HBO-Hound is less scary and physically agressive towards Sansa, HBO-Sansa is older and less frightened, especially during the Blackwater episode where she seems to come into her own.)
As much as I would have loved to have seen the book scene come to life, it was just completely unrealistic, as the characterization of Sansa and the Hound in the show is different enough at this point that it would not have worked to do the scene from the book.
At this point, I am just SO glad they kept that scene in at all. It definitely had viewers and reviewers talking about San/San in a way that I did NOT expect. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
1782	Woman of War	2012-05-31	I am suggesting a mindgame here:
Imagine you only and definitely only have seen HBO and be honest about it:
And then imagine Sandor were gay, I know he isn't, no need to convince me.
I think his actions towards Sansa in S2 so far would all be the same if he had acted out of basic human compassion, honesty and the sincere wish to help, apart from somewhat liking that girl. And he expresses those emotions as far as a damaged personality like Sandor is able to express them. Would he express them differently if he only had a "fatherly" concern?
Would his kindness towards Sansa  have taken any other shape than it does here in HBO if he had no sexual interest in her, because for example he might be gay, only as mindgame here?
i believe there might have been exactly the same exchanges between them, exactly the same kindness towards her  if we assume there is no erotic tension. And it is well possible that Martin, having written this episode, is perfectly aware of it. He consciously left out the rapey undertones and the idea of a kiss. Which, logically, does ot mean that there will never be any erotic attraction but so far there is none given by the HBO script.
So my point is: there are no erotic undertones to feel in this episode, only concern from Sandor's side. Or are there any?
1783	Valkyrja	2012-05-31	Just because the erotic/romantic/sexual undertones were not included from the book, does not mean that none were conveyed, even if accidentally. I've seen plenty of reviews from non-book readers saying that it seemed to them that the Hound had special feelings for Sansa. I think that is one thing that cannot be denied here.....whether in the books or in the show: it is not 'just' basic human compassion that makes Sandor care for Sansa during their time together at King's Landing. There are other people who are in states of distress at various times (take Lollys, for example) during this time, that he did not help. Sandor is attracted to Sansa for who she is, and wants helping her, from very early on. Whether this attraction is fatherly, sexual, romantic, etc. , none of the above or a strange combination is thus far left to the interpretation of the reader. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
1784	Woman of War	2012-05-31	Yes, the attraction is "special", no doubt. Maybe Sansa represents his lost childhood, maybe his last chance of return into humanity, maybe his wish to finally do something right, maybe sexual desire. In the books he has grossly botched that situation and Sansa herself was of course aware of the threat to her life with the knife on her throat. But she was ot aware of the danger of getting raped, she merely expected a kiss, about that she had heard  in her stories, about everything else she knew nothing. Whereas HBO Sansa had not only nearly been raped in the streets, she had heard about rape all day long and would have recognized that kind of threat straightaway. The plotline could not be written the same way and so everything is open to different interpretations. In episode 9 so far Sandor has done much better, no sexual approach.  I am as well convinced that the two characters will meet again and that this might be the real test what Sandor has made of his life.
You cannot compare Sansa to Lollys because Sandor, in the books, expressly states that he hates cripples and the weak like Lollys and Tyrion. This is indeed a very ugly side of him, distinguishing between the weak who are worthy of his concern, like especially Sansa, and those mishappen who are scum to him like Lollys and Tyrion. The quality of "special" that Sansa represents to him is imo open here. Could he, always within the HBO script, feel the same wish to help a, say, ten year old innocent, wonderful and goldenhearted boy, who gets tortured and abused and who might represent the child Sandor would have wanted to be? Or not?
					
					
							Edited by Woman of War, 31 May 2012 - 11:35 AM.
1785	Valkyrja	2012-05-31	Sorry, your are right, Lollys was a bad example, but was the only one I could think of off the top of my head.
Regarding if Sansa were a boy, would he still care for her in a special way.......I really have no idea.
I don't understand the need to play 'mind games' with this issue.....yes, stepping back and looking at things  from different perspective is always good. Nevertheless, I'm hardly going to change my mind about liking 'San/San' just because I am imagining for a second that the Hound is gay. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
I stand by my belief that the sexual/violent aspect of their relationship was toned down for the TV show because it might make Sandor's character much less sympathetic to tv audience, and it would probably be extremely uncomfortable for the actors portraying these characters. Despite being aged up for the tv series, the age gap between HBO Hound and Sansa is even wider than in the books. I think they set out from the beginning to 'tone down' the character of the Hound so that hardly any of his 'intense' scenes with Sansa would need to happen the way they do in the books.
1786	Woman of War	2012-05-31	Well, I guess, that way Martin has taken himself the freedom to do with that relationship whatever he wants in the future without having it burdened with something definite already. You can put much more subtlety into a written story than into the less ambigous medium movie. In a book things are open to interpretation, whereas in a show like that they are done or not and images can have an impact that cannot be taken back.
In cinema  it's ALL about looks that are exchanged, and these special LOOKS I am missing here.
And don't get me wrong, I am a movie addict.
1787	Kittykatknits	2012-05-31	I don't agree that he withdrew his offer.

This is setting us up for some later San/San event in the future. I do believe he is in love with her and she is drawn to him.I agree with your interpretation, very well stated. I thought it was rather apparent that she refused him but everyone who I have talked to in RL and have not read the books thought she went with him. So, it probably wasn't that clear to many viewers.The important takeaway from this scene is to show that she trusts him and feel confident that he would never hurt her.It's been my theory for a long time that they will cross paths and he'll end up dying for her. The vibe from the show was different than the books but the way that scene ended really left met even more confident about it afterwards than I did before.Well, I guess, that way Martin has taken himself the freedom to do with that relationship whatever he wants in the future without having it burdened with something definite already. You can put much more subtlety into a written story than into the less ambigous medium movie. In a book things are open to interpretation, whereas in a show like that they are done or not and images can have an impact that cannot be taken back.In cinema it's ALL about looks that are exchanged, and these special LOOKS I am missing here.And don't get me wrong, I am a movie addict.I've been reading online reviews and talking to people in RL all week who have not read the books and the reactions have a big range. Some of have said his feelings are merely those of someone who wants to protect her while others thought he loved her. It's all over the map, which I think reflects the reaction of fans of the books.As for the looks, there were a few of them, the look in season one when he took her to the queen, his watching her after the conversation, and the looks between them in the last episode. A few people thought he was in love with her because of those.So, I think it's open but I do agree the obvious sexual component has been removed. Since this is for a TV show, I can understand the decision.Although, the dynamic between the two in Clash reminds me quite a bit of the movie Labyrinth if you have ever seen that. I'd like to have seen some of that on the screen.
1788	Juliads	2012-05-31	I am suggesting a mindgame here:Imagine you only and definitely only have seen HBO and be honest about it:And then imagine Sandor were gay, I know he isn't, no need to convince me.I think his actions towards Sansa in S2 so far would all be the same if he had acted out of basic human compassion, honesty and the sincere wish to help, apart from somewhat liking that girl.

Or are there any?good question, and i love a mindgame!If there were any erotic undertones to the scene, it would be up to the individual viewer to decide. I suppose that question has been on everyone's mind whenever a san/san moment pops up.  If tv Sandor was motivated by any physical attraction it was displayed very subtly.  What I really enjoy about their scenes together is this apparant brute, a violent killer is compelled to show concern for Sansa's well being, and I suspect a great deal of restraint around her too.  This last episode revealed more of his personality to the tv viewers, more vulgar, violent,etc.  Yet I felt that the bedroom scene was his strongest sign of restraint.  When he responded to her with "no, i won't hurt you" He seemed subdued and a little defeated.I'm not a reader of the novels, but If his character has been curtailing any of his mannerisms or behavior for her comfort, I imagine that would be a strong sign of some type of affection forming, at least on his behalf.Whether or not it is sexual or more paternal, it is very hard to say with only the tv scenes to rely on.  My guess is, there might be a combination of reasons, but physical attraction is probably one of the factors.If he were gay would he have the same reaction to Sansa?  it's hard to answer because i don't really know what motivates him.  Is he kind to other defenseless young females in KL, or just Sansa because of the abuse she recieves from the king?My guess is he's not shown any thought or care about another person's(male or female) well-being besides Sansa, and that has been very crypic at best.  If the attraction between them both was withdrawn..I would gamble he would grow to dislike the king for his abusive ways just the same, but not have the extra focus on Sansa herself. He might not have taken the time to search for her during the riots, etc.I do love their story-lines, give me something to over-analyze /happy.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='^_^' /> !

1792	Kittykatknits	2012-05-31	Omigod, selfspoilering! This is like unwrapping your birthday gifts one day too early! Don't!Eh, i have a pretty strict policy about reading the last couple pages of books as a general rule. I want to know what type of ending I'm in for before I put the effort in to reading a book. I'm probably in the minority on this though.

I want to know what type of ending I'm in for before I put the effort in to reading a book. I'm probably in the minority on this though.So do I, I have no shame about self-spoiling in a mystery and finding out who the killer is,or in a romance to find out if they get married, but reading the last chapter in ASOIF isn't going to get you anywhere.  I am very disappointed in those who are telling Juliads things she should read for herself, lol.  Let her suffer like the rest of us did.  /bawl.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bawl:' />
1794	Woman of War	2012-05-31	I guess, with the next book I will do that with my favorite POVs, only to know if they are still alive or not - and what am I going to do if they arent??? Defenestrate the books or read them?
Well i guess I will read them and get adapted. My family is anyway always accusing mo of listening to depri-music like Garbarek or June Tabor or Mark Knopfler or early music with original instruments. so I will be able to stand original literary depression  /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />

Twelve years later and I'm still grieving. I am mentally preparing for more of the same. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Is it to much to hope that none of them to die? Yeah, I know, wishful thinking.And Mark Knopfler - Oh, be still my heart. Love his voice, love his music. I think I know what I'm going to go listen to now.

I had reservations about saying anything, but I figured that since this thread was labeled 'Book Spoilers' already, that a few more dind't matter, especially since Juliads specifically asked to be spoiled.
Ah well.....too late to take it back...... sowwy!!! /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
1797	Roboginger	2012-06-01	One reason I am really pissed off is because I feel it is extremely unfair that we are now supposed to be taking the HBO version as 'canon' because of GRRM's involvement and D&D's knowledge of the series' end. I did not start watching an HBO show only to have them 'spoiler' me and ruin my enjoyment of the later books in the series because I can now deduce things that are or aren't going to happen via what happens in the tv series. /bs.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bs:' />Bugger that.I agree Here, it is kind of a bummer /frown5.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':frown5:' />  It almost would have been better if the book series was finished before the show was out. I would hate to have the show some how influence the books, or have some kind of huge spoiler unknowingly thrown in.
1798	Maroucia	2012-06-01	I heard an interview in which GRRM says that the fact that there is now a tv-series about his ASOIAF story doesn't influence his writing in any way. I hope he was telling the truth, but I trust he was.
1799	Rinso	2012-06-01	Eh, how can something that was never alive to be dead and buried? Sandor is one of the few characters that the show has totally dropped the ball with and he was basically demoted to a sad looking extra in the background. I was pretty pissed off about it in Season 1 (considering he's more or less my favorite character in the books) but I got over it and went into Season 2 with no expectations about him whatsoever. So I'm pretty zen about how lame his last scene with Sansa was when I compare it to what was in the book.
Seriously, in the few parts where the show falls flat (like Sandor Clegane's characterization for example) I really envy the fans who watch it and haven't read the books. They don't know better and happily move on. I wish I wasn't such a purist but it's not like I can help it /worried.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':worried:' />

1803	Istari	2012-06-01	GRRM's intentions for Sandor and Sansa shouldn't based on the show. GRRM had to edit the bedroom scene in ACOK to match their on-screen relationship already prescribed by HBO.
I refuse to take the show as canon - that is just silly.
I also refuse to believe that Sandor and Sansa is 'dead and buried'.
We all know that GRRM is ruthless when it comes to killing off characters. I believe that the gravedigger is Sandor. If his story (or his significance to the grand scheme of things) was finished, GRRM would have killed him off.
Which leads me to the question: Why keep the character alive - especially a character like him - only to have him live in isolation?
Answer: His story is not finished. To me, that indicates that San/San is alive and above ground.

But then again.... if he does turn out to be dead (and lets pray to the old gods and the Seven for him to still be alive) then my theory goes out the window....
The only consolation that I have (if Sandor really is dead) is that there was a meaningful connection between the two of them while they were still alive. Sansa cares for Sandor, and she knows her cared about her.....
The only bad news is that Sandor would have died completely unaware of how important he was to Sansa. What makes this worse is that 'people dying without knowing the truth'  is a theme that happens all too often in ASOIAF....(most obvious example would be the fact that Rob ... and I guess Cat too... died under the impression that Bran and Rickon were both dead)

1804	Yvonesan	2012-06-16	I was really anxious about Sandor/Sansa's scene prior to the episode but I was glad to find my fears unfounded. My initial reaction was a little disappointment (but not surprised due to the limited time available in an episode) that the scene wasn't longer but I was pleased with what we did get all the same. Even with the changes from the book. I thought it was significant to have Sansa voice the thought that Sandor "won't hurt" her, considering that one of the possible interpretations from the book scene is that he fully intended to hurt her. It seems to me that GRRM doesn't want this to be the case. He really drove the point home in the scene... with Sandor repeatedly saying it too... "I'll keep you safe", "no, little bird I won't hurt you" and his frightened reaction to Sansa's belief that she'll be safe with Stannis or so many of the powers that be in her world. The one thing I really regret after this is knowing that we won't see Rory McCann's Sandor in any scenes with Sansa for at least quite some time to come. Thank heavens we'll still see him next season at least! He just is Sandor Clegane to me. I truly hope that they won't relegate his scenes with Arya to a minor detail.

I think he's making sure that we keep the character in our minds because he is going to surface again at some point and when he does, he will still be playing a part in Sansa's story.

It will be my first question to anyone who reads WoW before I do (just as it was when ADwD was published)... if Sandor Clegane has re-appeared. For now, I just have to read Sansa's chapters to know that "SanSan" is not over yet.

So it will be quite some time before we see any further interactions (if ever, but please let it happen!) and the scene reflects that but there was no final closure to it either, just as there wasn't in the books. Which makes sense based on what has already been written, as the author hardly wants to remove the possibilities since it would give away some of his future intentions for the story.
1808	cannibaltortoise	2012-10-08	In the books there is no way it is just a paternal/protective thing, in a way it is. He obviously cares for her and wants to protect her, but It's pretty clear part of him wants a bit more then that. Also based on Sansas dreams etc. I'm thinking in a way she wouldn't mind too much, yeah Iknow she's still a child, but this is Westeros.Personally I do prefer the protective element though.

1810	Le Cygne	2012-11-12	Quotes:Sandor in Blackwater:Show scene - "I could take you with me.  Take you to Winterfell.  I'll keep you safe.  Do you want to go home?...  No, Little Bird, I won't hurt you."Book scene - "I could keep you safe," he rasped. "They're all afraid of me. No one would hurt you again, or I'd kill them."Sansa before the Blackwater scene (he's the only one who gets his own prayer):I would be gladder if it were the Hound, Sansa thought.  Harsh as he was, she did not believe Sandor Clegane would let any harm come to her....He is no true knight but he saved me all the same, she told the Mother. Save him if you can, and gentle the rage inside him.Sansa at the end of the Blackwater scene:Some instinct made her lift her hand and cup his cheek with her fingers. The room was too dark for her to see him, but she could feel the stickiness of the blood, and a wetness that was not blood. "Little bird," he said once more, his voice raw and harsh as steel on stone. Then he rose from the bed. Sansa heard cloth ripping, followed by the softer sound of retreating footsteps.When she crawled out of bed, long moments later, she was alone. She found his cloak on the floor, twisted up tight, the white wool stained by blood and fire. The sky outside was darker by then, with only a few pale green ghosts dancing against the stars. A chill wind was blowing, banging the shutters. Sansa was cold. She shook out the torn cloak and huddled beneath it on the floor, shivering. How long she stayed there she could not have said, but after a time she heard a bell ringing, far off across the city.Sansa after the Blackwater scene:I wish the Hound were here. The night of the battle, Sandor Clegane had come to her chambers to take her from the city, but Sansa had refused. Sometimes she lay awake at night, wondering if she'd been wise. She had his stained white cloak hidden in a cedar chest beneath her summer silks. She could not say why she'd kept it. The Hound had turned craven, she heard it said; at the height of the battle, he got so drunk the Imp had to take his men. But Sansa understood. She knew the secret of his burned face. It was only the fire he feared. That night, the wildfire had set the river itself ablaze, and filled the very air with green flame. Even in the castle, Sansa had been afraid. Outsideâ<U+0080>¦ she could scarcely imagine it.Sandor on Sansa after Blackwater (he brings her up over a dozen times):"Seven hells. The little sister."..."This one's own sister"..."I watched them beat your sister"..."I never beat your sister"..."Or maybe a sister? Sansa. That's it, isn't it? The wolf bitch wants to kill the pretty bird."..."I saved your sister's life too"..."Your sister sang me a sweet little song."..."You ought to sing me a pretty little song, the way your sister did."..."I thought your sister was the one with a head full of songs"..."What wife?"...The Hound sat on the bench closest to the door. His mouth twitched, but only the burned side. "She ought to dip him in wildfire and cook him. Or tickle him till the moon turns black." He raised his wine cup and drained it straightaway....The Hound poured a cup of wine for Arya and another for himself, and drank it down while staring at the hearthfire. "The little bird flew away, did she?"..."A proper little lady. Not like her bloody sister."...He made a queer sound, and it took her a moment to realize he was sobbing.  "And the little bird, your pretty sister, I stood there in my white cloak and let them beat her."Sansa on Sandor after Blackwater (she thinks about him over a dozen times):[They] would have killed me, if not for the Hound....I wish the Hound were here...  Sometimes she lay awake at night, wondering if she'd been wise. She had his stained white cloak hidden in a cedar chest beneath her summer silks...  But Sansa understood......a man as different from Sandor Clegane as......Sansa wondered what Megga would think about kissing the Hound, as she had....uglier than the Hound...A dog can smell a lie, you know, the Hound had told her once. She could almost hear the rough rasp of his voiceâ<U+0080>¦ She wondered what had become of Sandor Clegane....Sansa found Bryen's old blind dog in her little alcove beneath the steps, and lay down next to him. He woke and licked her face. "You sad old hound," she said, ruffling his fur....It was Lothor Brune's voice, she realized. Not the Hound's, no, how could it be? Of course it had to be Lothor.....Only then he was bigger than Tyrion had any right to be, and when he climbed into the bed his face was scarred only on one side. "I'll have a song from you," he rasped, and Sansa woke and found the old blind dog beside her once again.  "I wish that you were Lady," she said....When the mob sought to rape her, the Hound carried her to safety, not Littlefinger....as tall as the Hound...He had come to Sansa in the darkness as green fire filled the sky. He took a song and a kiss, and left me nothing but a bloody cloak...."You do know what goes on in a marriage bed, I hope?"  She thought of Tyrion, and of the Hound and how he'd kissed her, and gave a nod.

1811	Woman of War	2012-11-17	Le Cygne, all your quotes are from the books and far more advanced thatn the series are at that point.
I think it is well possible that GRRM may keep the general direction that Sandor wants to be more than Sansa's protector. After all this mixture of protectiveness and outright sexual violence, with a knife at her throat and explicit thought of rape, is hugely interesting and adds important facets to the character Sandor. Actually without his infatuation with Sansa and his travel with Arya the character Sandor would be quite pointless to write and to read  about, one more evil guy, so what.
But it is possible that in episode 9 GRRM has been preparing us for a final outcome that leaves out some of the ambiguity of their relationship. I am quite sure that a reciprocal love relationship between Sandor and Sansa has never been intended in Martin's story but that the author wanted to let us guess and consider the possibility. Something so deliciously twisted! 
In the series the author apparently shortens and straightens their common storyline, leaving out beautiful but sadly unnecessary twists and hints that will finally be meaningless for the story outcome. Sandor, if he ever leaves the Quiet Isle, will be Sansa's protector, he will die for her and if she is by then old enough to recognize his emotions she might be aware that he loved her in his weird way - at the moment before she sees him dying.
1812	Little Red Riding Hood	2012-11-20	I sincerely hope not!
Do you want  rip my "heart out ( leaving her for that dwarf " or anyone other than my Hound)?
 I think it will be the only way to lose my obsession with ASOIAF. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />
1813	Feather Crystal	2012-11-20	I just really hate that the relationship between Sandor and Sansa is viewed as a positive romance. The way the SanSan fans portray it, its akin to the Disney Beauty and the Beast, and every other Disney female character that is attracted to a man that scares and intimidates her, threatens her with bodily harm, and plays on her insecurities. The Disney female also rejects anyone that is reasonable, or treats her kindly, and would have provided more suitable circumstances. Sandor is also a full grown man and he's attracted to a young teenaged girl. That alone grosses me out!
My personal opinion is that GRRM did not intend for the romance to bloom. I see Sandor having an attraction that thankfully he didn't act upon forcefully. That's the only good thing he has going for himself. Sansa was scared witless in Kings Landing and I'm hoping that if she had any romantic notions, it's chalked up to her youth and desire for a protector. She's beginning to grow up at the Vale and learning that she can take care of herself. She won't have any further desires or need for  a "Sandor". That is what I am hoping for her character development.

1817	Feather Crystal	2012-11-21	Nobody likes violence, and its bizarre of you to say that a person would have to enjoy violence to enjoy the books. It might be helpful for you to imagine what it might be like for a 25 year old woman who is attracted to a 14 year old boy. How would that make you feel? What would you think of a female, old enough to have graduated from college and to see her pursue a 14 year old 8th grader. Does that gross you out? It does me.Our society has made it seem acceptable for older men to pursue younger women, and our advertising is full of it. It makes me sad and mad every time I see a young girl being sexualized.And men who chase younger women are desperate to find a reason to claim that what is a culturally constructed choice is really an unavoidable biological reality. The difficult-to-deny reality is, that younger women lack the experience and wisdom to call their older lovers on their bullshit. One of the main reasons older men lust for underage women is the desire to control them. In addition, men desire to have their egos stoked by believing that they are still attractive to younger women.Thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s nothing innocent or harmless or healthy about older men pursuing substantially younger women. The cost is high to everyone involved. While a few young women may say they are attracted to much older guys, it's often because they falsely imagine themselves to be â<U+0080><U+009C>so much more matureâ<U+0080><U+009D> than â<U+0080><U+009C>other girlsâ<U+0080><U+009D> their age.Lynn Phillips, a psychology professor at New York University, did a famous study of young women (mostly under legal age) who were in relationships with significantly older men. Most of the girls she interviewed described these affairs as mutual, exciting, and fulfilling. They pushed back against the suggestion that they were being exploited, claiming in many cases to have initiated or at least welcomed the sex with older men. Phillips then interviewed a similar number of older women. Each of these was over 30, and each had been in a relationship with a much older man while still in her teens. With the benefit of hindsight and experience, these older women acknowledged that theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>d been used and hurt and exploited. They admitted that their claims of maturity and sexual adventurousness were all a pretense.When adult men sexualize teen girls, even just by ogling them, the girls are re-enforced with the idea that their worth in the world is dependent on how sexy they are. Girls who choose men so far out of their age ranges tend toward low self-esteem and depression. These arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t sweet coming-of-age stories. They are pornographic story lines that young girls are eager for sexual initiation at the hands of an older, wiser mentor.
1818	Woman of War	2012-11-21	Great, Feather Crystal, that is about the best post I have read about this topic in these forums.
/thumbsup.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':thumbsup:' />
1819	Little Red Riding Hood	2012-11-21	Maybe, I have not explained well, I'm not saying that "you should" love violence, what I say is that violence, hatred, love and kindness are part of our very nature, because we are human and that is an essential component of the novel that we like. Or you deny that ASOIAF is terribly violent?That does not mean that I advocate violence, you see it in my post?: No.Nor defend the relations of old men with teenagers. That's not what I defend. Please, read my post. I am against it ( for that reason, Littlefinger or Craster or Walder Frey  disgusts me so much).What I advocate is the archetype of this unique relationship. I think it is clear in my post.What I advocate is, say, that they are the exception of that rule (as my father and my mother are the exception). Because the bond is established in spite of the age. Beyond age, beauty, education, intelligence, or social classes, they established a bond like human beings.An attraction between two human beings.

Beyond age, beauty, education, intelligence, or social classes, they established a bond like human beings.An attraction between two human beings.I think ASOIAF is very realistic. I actually think GRRM is making a political and religious statement. He was a Vietnam war conscientious objector, after all. And I'd like to think that GRRM is more enlightened about male/female relationships. He recognizes that some males are attracted to much younger females, but I refuse to believe that he actually intends to have Sandor and Sansa become lovers. I think he understands that it is wrong, and I'm hoping for he'll pen Sansa to become stronger, confident, and more mature and realize that Sandor is not what she really wants or needs.
1821	Le Cygne	2012-11-21	It's romance, Westeros style, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  He protected her, and she trusted him.  He wanted to kiss her, and she imagined he did.  He broke down because of the wildfire, and she understood.  He felt terrible that he left her, and she wished he was there.  He couldn't stop talking about her, and she couldn't stop thinking about him.  There's something there in the books, and there's something there in the show.I wasn't real thrilled with season 2 and yet I loved the show SanSan scenes.  They were even better the second time.  The actors are wonderful.  Favorites are 1x08 The Pointy End (another GRRM episode) and 2x06 The Old Gods and The New and 2x09 Blackwater was a great Sandor episode all around.  I wish there were more but I like all of them.  The bedroom scene was odd (I guess it was just chance he was sent there then), but I'll take it.Why didn't Sandor leave his cloak?  Why didn't Cersei order the killing of the bastards?  Why did she slap Joffrey?  Why did Jaime kill his cousin?  Why didn't he call Brienne "Wench" (at least Sandor called Sansa "Little Bird")?  Why was Brienne a bloodthirsty killer?  Why didn't Catelyn make Jaime swear an oath?  Why didn't Ghost help Jon beat Qhorin?  Why did Ygritte run away instead of Jon let her go?  Why didn't Arya kill the guard?  Why did she have such an easy time in Harrenhal?  Why did Jaqen kill the Tickler?  Why did they cut good Jaqen scenes?  Why was Dany's storyline changed beyond recognition?  Why did Joffrey torture the prostitute?  Why didn't the men of Westeros take off their clothes, too?  Why were Shae and Tywin so nice?  Why was Littlefinger everywhere?  Why was Ros everywhere (or even there at all)?  Why didn't Renly eat a peach?  Why did Brienne kill the Rainbow Guards instead of Loras?  Why Talisa instead of Jeyne?  Why take away Robb's honorable reason for breaking his promise?I wish I knew.  The point is, they made a lot of changes.And here's an interview with GRRM on Geek and Sundry, after this episode aired:Interviewer 1: "I'm a big fan of the Hound, myself, actuallyâ<U+0080>¦"GRRM: "I do know there's all these people out there, who are as they call themselves the SanSan fans, who want to see Sandor and Sansa get together in the end."Interviewer 2: "The TV show has played with that a little, probably stoked those fires, I would think."GRRM:  "Well sure, and I've played with it in the books, there's something there, but it's still interesting to see how many people have responded to it."Interviewer 1:  "I'm not going to say that hasn't crossed my mind."http://www.youtube.c...h?v=cLynybVOi2IAnother GRRM interview:"One of the reasons I wanted to do this with HBO is that I wanted to keep the sex," he admitted. "We had some real problems because Dany is only 13 in the books, and that's based on medieval history. They didn't have this concept of adolescence or the teenage years. You were a child or you were an adult. And the onset of sexual maturity meant you were an adult. So I reflected that in the books."But that's a problem for a TV show."So we ended up with a 22-year-old portraying an 18-year-old, instead of an 18-year-old portraying a 13-year-old," George said. "If we decided to lose the sex we could have kept the original ages. And once you change the age of one character you have to change the ages of all the characters, and change the date of the war [that dethroned the Mad King].""The fact we made all these changes indicates how important we thought sex was."http://www.okmagazin...mes-thrones-hboAnd another GRRM interview, also recent:The other big decision we had to make to keep all that material was the ages of the characters.  In the books, Dany is 13 years old when all of this begins.  And I was drawingâ<U+0080>¦ although my books are fantasy, not historical fiction in the strict sense, they occur in an imaginary world and imaginary kingdoms, they're very heavily based on real history.  And of course, I've done a ton of research about real medieval history.   And basically in the middle  ages, they did not have our concept of adolescence, of this sort of these sort of teenage years in between where we're kind of adults, but not adults, and we have different ages, where we're allowed to vote at this age, and we're allowed to go to war and die at a different age, and we're allowed to drink at another age, and have sex at a different age, depending on which state we're in, all of that stuff.  They had child and adult.  And the difference between them was the onset of sexual maturity.And we still have in our cultures, remnants of this older structure in our ceremonies, the Jewish bar mitzvah, the Catholic confirmation ceremony, which I went through at 13, reaffirming as an adult the vows made for me by my godparents at baptism.  The Catholics once considered 13 adulthoodâ<U+0080>¦  These things are just remnants now, but they weren't remnants in the middle ages, and they're not in the books.  They had a very different way of looking at things.  So I was using that based on historical precedent.But there was no way that was going to fly in our present environment.  If we had cast a 13 year old Dany, there could have been no sexual stuff whatsoever with her.  And even if we had cast a 17 year old actress playing a 13 year old, there are some really stringent laws in the UK, you can't do that, even if you have an actress who is past the age of consent playing someone who is under the age of consent, you cannot have a sexual situation...  So we have a 22 year old actress playing a 17 year old Dany, instead of a 17 year old actress playing a 13 year old Dany, and we did that deliberately so we could include this material.  So I think that speaks to the fact that we did think it was necessary to the story we wanted to tell...http://www.youtube.c...h?v=QTTW8M_etkoI added the transcript...

1823	Woman of War	2012-11-22	Sandor is an immensely interesting character BUT......
I am a woman who enjoys her sexuality and I feel not the least little bit attracted to the character Sandor, neither book nor HBO Sandor. EEEWW! About as erotic as chopped wood, stale cheese and dirty laundry in my bed!

You choose to interpret that he's saying they will have a relationship, and I think he means he's suggested an attraction, mainly on Sandor's end, but that doesn't mean that it will develop into anything further.I am completely disgusted and nauseated by Sandor. Sure, I pity his upbringing, but what you do with the rest of your life is a choice. You can choose to remain a victim and victimize others, or you can choose to change and be better than the people around you. It seems the Sandor character has finally made a good choice staying on the island. I don't expect to read very much about him again. The Sansa character has other more important development in future.
1825	Little Red Riding Hood	2012-11-22	I think ASOIAF is very realistic.Really! Ned, cutting the heads to the deserters is realistic?. /eek.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':eek:' /> ..Well, it seems that my standards of what is realistic are very differents from yours.I actually think GRRM is making a political and religious statement.Is very possible, but in that case donÂ´t you believe  that GRRM could be telling us :People can redeem (and redeem itself), choose with freedom  and to be happy whatever their choice?As on these specific characters GRRM shows us-as the books shows: Sansa  thinks about him, she dreams with him, she desires be with him, she donÂ´t cares about his past.She regretted not having gone with him, she fantasizes about his kisses, she dreams that he is up to her bridal bed, she keeps his cloak- that we know does not exist, and we know that in Westeros is the symbol of marriage- under her clothes-(and as we know that this cloak does not exist -then-what we're seeing is her desire for him.)"Despite all this explosive mix that we have inside, that we are:Love, hate, kindness,even cruelty, we can be better and make that a better world will be possible"Yes, I think he is making a Statement about be human.

1829	Feather Crystal	2012-11-23	I just feel sorry for you. If you don't understand or recognize how wrong and sick the "Beauty and the Beast" style storyline is, you could be doomed to being victimized yourself in the future by a controlling and abusive male.
1830	Woman of War	2012-11-24	I just feel sorry for you. If you don't understand or recognize how wrong and sick the "Beauty and the Beast" style storyline is, you could be doomed to being victimized yourself in the future by a controlling and abusive male.I've worked in a kind of social worker job with women who left their abusive husbands. And there were women who did not let me sleep at night: those who believed they could redeem their violent and controlling men by love and patience, by staying with them, by waiting until their love had turned them into  better men. In short: those women who put their own safety behind the wish to keep and reform their man. And they even felt a twisted pride for being " the one and only", the chosen one, who could reach this man - until they ended in the emergency ward or even in the morgue (the latter did not happen fortunately while I was in the job, the first did)It is not a woman's mission to save a violent guy, there is nothing romantic in it, this doesn't enhance her value, she has a life of her own. She should see to saving herself.Now we are in a fictional world here and we are allowed to play and to smoothe our nightly dreams with deliciously twisted fanfiction scenarios that would be awful and dangerous in RL. This is what fiction is for. But it would be highly dangerous to transfer those dreams to our personal history.
1831	ShowOverBooks	2012-11-24	What exactly, is the difference between Hound/Sansa and Drogo/Dany? The fact that The Hound is ugly?
1832	ShowOverBooks	2012-11-24	Nobody likes violence, and its bizarre of you to say that a person would have to enjoy violence to enjoy the books. It might be helpful for you to imagine what it might be like for a 25 year old woman who is attracted to a 14 year old boy. How would that make you feel? What would you think of a female, old enough to have graduated from college and to see her pursue a 14 year old 8th grader. Does that gross you out? It does me.Our society has made it seem acceptable for older men to pursue younger women, and our advertising is full of it. It makes me sad and mad every time I see a young girl being sexualized.And men who chase younger women are desperate to find a reason to claim that what is a culturally constructed choice is really an unavoidable biological reality. The difficult-to-deny reality is, that younger women lack the experience and wisdom to call their older lovers on their bullshit. One of the main reasons older men lust for underage women is the desire to control them. In addition, men desire to have their egos stoked by believing that they are still attractive to younger women.Thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s nothing innocent or harmless or healthy about older men pursuing substantially younger women. The cost is high to everyone involved. While a few young women may say they are attracted to much older guys, it's often because they falsely imagine themselves to be â<U+0080><U+009C>so much more matureâ<U+0080><U+009D> than â<U+0080><U+009C>other girlsâ<U+0080><U+009D> their age.Lynn Phillips, a psychology professor at New York University, did a famous study of young women (mostly under legal age) who were in relationships with significantly older men.

They are pornographic story lines that young girls are eager for sexual initiation at the hands of an older, wiser mentor."Nobody likes violence"Well, that is a baffling claim. Given the popularity of hunting, combat sports, and action/horror movies.It is not just our society which has made older man/younger woman 'acceptable'. It is also nature. The nature which drove and evolved our behaviour during the hundreds of thousands of years before 'civilization' brought about by agriculture.A boy in his late teens is not the physical equal of a man in his late 20s/early 30s. He would not be as skilled and capable a hunter. A girl in her late teens/early 20s is in her prime reproductive capacity.After we became civilized, it became possible for a man to gain wealth as he got older - making him a better provider. A wealthy man in his 50s still has good breeding potential. A woman in her 50s has no such potential.

1834	Feather Crystal	2012-11-24	@ShowOverBooks, we're not animals, we are, hopefully, enlightened intelligent beings who understand the harm of older men preying upon young, naive girls. We also live in a society were women should be able to be financially independent. There are plenty of older wealthy women who could support a much younger man, but it wouldn't make either scenario healthy or morally right. 
Regarding Daenerys and Drogo...I never commented on them previously, but I don't approve of their age difference either. And there aren't as many fans for their storyline, which I find curious. I can't help but wonder if it isn't because Dany's is a much stronger, confident character?
1835	Feather Crystal	2012-11-24	As for the "breeding" argument, I don't buy it. Men are more interested in the sex part with no strings attached. Today's older males would be more likely to want any fetuses aborted.
1836	Little Red Riding Hood	2012-11-24	That is your opinion, not absolute reality.
What has that to do with Sandor / Sansa?
1837	Feather Crystal	2012-11-25	I was replying to ShowOverBooks. They were assuming I approved of Daenerys and Drogo.
1838	ShowOverBooks	2012-11-25	I was replying to ShowOverBooks. They were assuming I approved of Daenerys and Drogo.Ah, but I was not replying to you specifically in that post.
1839	ShowOverBooks	2012-11-25	As for the "breeding" argument, I don't buy it. Men are more interested in the sex part with no strings attached. Today's older males would be more likely to want any fetuses aborted.Men want sex. We are fine with having children (most of us want to have children - it's instinctive to reproduce). It's responsibility we don't want.Look at all the rich powerful men in history who had harems and hundreds, even thousands of children. If we have none, we want them more as we age. It's our genetic legacy.
1840	jons nissa	2012-11-25	SPOILERS!Sandor, if he ever leaves the Quiet Isle, will be Sansa's protector, he will die for her and if she is by then old enough to recognize his emotions she might be aware that he loved her in his weird way - at the moment before she sees him dying.except that sansa seems to also harbor feelings for sandor as we come to realize during her time in the vale.You can take GRRM's words either way. You choose to interpret that he's saying they will have a relationship, and I think he means he's suggested an attraction, mainly on Sandor's end, but that doesn't mean that it will develop into anything further.yes, most sansan fans take this quote as support that the two will marry and have lovely puppies and live happily ever after. but I agree, there is clearly a bond between the two that is FULL of sexual tension but that their interactions with each other were not meant to be seen as a courtship for the two.What exactly, is the difference between Hound/Sansa and Drogo/Dany? The fact that The Hound is ugly?i think objections to the hound have nothing to do with the fact that he is ugly. probably more to do with his violent tendencies, excess with drinking and jaded view of mankind. telling sansa that her father enjoyed killing was no kindness and unsupported. still, he does have sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s well being at heart and does what he can to help her. thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just not enough to base a â<U+0080><U+009C>love storyâ<U+0080><U+009D> on, imo.Our society has made it seem acceptable for older men to pursue younger women, and our advertising is full of it. It makes me sad and mad every time I see a young girl being sexualized.while i agree with woman of war and feather crystal that sexualizing women, especially young women, is a serious problem in our world, i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think grrm is trying to do away with that. his story is set in a world where young girls marry older men. period. end of story. he doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t seem to be focusing on illustrating the problems with that. heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s created too many situations where that is what happens and everyone deals with it. heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s said over and over that dany and drogo are a love story. sansa, on the other hand was only in love with fairytales. her problems with tyrion were not based on their age difference, her interest in willas existed despite the age difference and she has imagined sexual situations with sandor despite their age difference. grrm is focusing on other things here, not the age of the two people involved being appropriate or not.

I guess rape is less objectionable than criticizing a girl's father.so many things to address.first off, from your name, i take it you prefer the show to the books. as we know, the show can be very different from the books at times. case and point, dany and drogo's wedding night on the show portrayed dubious consent, if that. in the books, there is no question of rape that night.also, drogo IS very gentle, kind and positive with regard to dany as much as is possible for a dothraki lord. you may want to bring up their early sex life here and yes, he doesn't seem very concerned about dany's distress. i agree, this was a dark period for dany but she manages to make things more advantageous for herself and comes to love her husband completely. drogo also shows his love for her. you may have a different interpretation but the author meant for this relationship to be seen as a positive one and shows how dany grows in strength and respect. if he succeeded to show that is debatable. but this thread is not about dany and drogo so let's not get too side tracked.the example of the hound talking about her father was to support the claim that he had a dark view of mankind. ned is one of the noblest characters in westeros but in the hound's eyes, he's just another killer. that's not the end of the world but not what one would choose for sansa who loves chivalry and songs. ultimately, i am glad sansa had a friendship with sandor because he really meant to open her eyes to the world and help her prepare herself for what was to come. however, the fact that his outlook on the world was so dismal could mean he might not be the best one for that job. the fact that sansa is terrified at the start of each of their encounters also doesn't bode well.again, this is to answer your question about why people object to sandor more than drogo. nothing more. btw, i prefer the books but love the show.

She didn't have to seduce him to get him to treat her as a human being, rather than property. Unlike the other Kingsguards.Drogo treated Dany far worse than The Hound treated Sansa. I guess you can't expect a Targaryan to behave rationally. A bit surprised to see the attitude here, though.A handsome chieftain is more 'romantic' than an ugly guard, apparently.
1844	jons nissa	2012-11-25	A handsome chieftain is more 'romantic' than an ugly guard, apparently.you seem extremely fixated on looks. interesting. i prefer dialogue and actions. intent is also very important for me. anyway, time will tell if sansan is indeed going to ride off into the sunset. he may very well be her sun and stars and she the moon of his life. we'll see.
1845	Little Red Riding Hood	2012-11-26	she has imagined sexual situations with sandor despite their age difference. grrm is focusing on other things here, not the age of the two people involved being appropriate or not.I agree with you. That is precisely my pointI do not like  that in many countries exist a tendency to sexualize women (luckily this does not happen in my country).And  precisely another reason of why  like me so the  relationship of Sandor and Sansa, Is because although paradoxically exist clearly a bond between the two that is FULL of sexual tensionit emerges as a logic reaction to the feelings they have for one another.In the books exist another couples with differents ages:Walder Frey and his wife of 16 years old,	  Craster y sus hijas= Littlefinger.George writes with disgust about this. Not as "something pleasant". If not , he not had writing  characters like Brienne or Pia or many others. So do not think that's their goal: "sexualize women". He shows his disgust about it when he write characters that certainly treats Sansa like  a object to be used (as Joffrey, Littlefinger or Marillion)Not Sandor, (Despite their abrupts reactions that GRRM tells us he is leaving behind "burying them" in Quiet Isle.).who seems genuinely in love with her.

1847	Little Red Riding Hood	2012-11-26	Hi, girl! ( :.donÂ´t misunderstand me either. What I'm saying is that I agree with you on some points.I donÂ´t see very platonic their relationship-for the way that Sansa express her contact with Sandor.Sansa thinks about him, she dreams with him, she desires be with him, she donÂ´t cares about his past. She regretted not having gone with him, she fantasizes about his kisses, she dreams that he is up to her bridal bed, she keeps his cloak- that we know does not exist, and we know that in Westeros is the symbol of marriage- under her clothes-(and as we know that this cloak does not exist -then-what we're seeing is her desire for him.)It does not sound confusing to me, Rather look like attraction, simply.And indeed, Yes, Sansa has lived traumatic events-her brothers too, but ... then why she feels particularly attracted to Sandor and no for other guy?, Sandor donÂ´t looks like her "Knight of shining armor",She could think in this way with another guy, and she didnÂ´t.Moreover, the relationship of "Humbert Humbert" with Lolita is very different from the interaction of Sandor and Sansa, their characters too.Lolita didnÂ´t feel anything by Humbert Humbert (not to mention , that Lolita does not attracts him by herself ) and she was cheating him all the time. He recognizes it. He blackmails her. Humbert uses Lolita, and he donÂ´t matter what she really wants.In the relationships of Sandor and Sansa, sincerity is a factor very important.Sandor is attracted by who she is, not for her age. He never forces her to do something that she donÂ´t wants to do, despite that  the desire that he feels for her is palpably strong, and although he had that opportunity-of rape her or at least compel to give her consent;he stops and he leaves her with regret, Do you really imagines to Humbert doing something like that? I donÂ´t think so.Even, Sandor acknowledges, for example, that although she looks almost like a woman,  she isnÂ´t a woman yet ( serpentine scene) and although he is under the influence of alcohol, he controls his desire and he donÂ´t harms her.Sandor respects the decisions of Sansa, andAlways offers everything but not imposes anything to Sansa.He cares of her, like a fierce mastiff perhaps, He protects her , even, from himself.

1848	Little Red Riding Hood	2012-11-26	"Lolita" is written from the point of view of the character of Humbert, he is not an impartial narrator ...  of course.... then .. what we read is not sexual something between them. Not is the "reality" writing for a omniscient and impartial narrator. No. We read the point of view of Humbert.. and a point not very sincere because-as he recognizes  with irony- he writes for a " jury "(us, the readers) that judges him.In ASOIAF, the chapters are written in the third person, BUT ,are written from the point of view of the character, in this case Sansa, so when we read "He touches her almost gently" we're not reading the point of view of GRRM, much less the point of view of Sandor.We are reading the point of view of Sansa. We are reading what she feels when he touches her.

1849	jons nissa	2012-11-26	And indeed, Sansa has lived traumatic events-his brothers too, but ... then why she feels particularly attracted to Sandor and no for other guy?, Sandor donÂ´t looks like her "Knight of shining armor",She could think in this way with another guy, and she didnÂ´t.no he doesn't look like a knight be he behaves like one and i believe she is responding to that. he protects her from harm a great deal, fights in tournaments and even stands up to joffrey for her. he even has a pet name for her. i believe she reminds him of the good he has in him. and no, she couldn't think this with any other guy because other than tyrion, no one else comes to her rescue. he is very much her knight and her only knight at the moment so no, she couldn't tink of another guy this way.He cares of her, like a fierce mastiff perhaps, but with care after all.absolutely. i want him to be lady's substitute and defend sansa with his dying breath. but that's all i want from him for sansa. Moreover, the relationship of "Humbert Humbert" with Lolita is very different from the interaction of Sandor and Sansa, their characters too.this was probably not the best example, especially given the age issue at the core of the lolita relationship. i brought it up because it was the first one i could think of where a young girl becomes aware of her sexuality at the same time that an older man is around to pay attention to her. i realize that humbert is an unreliable narrator but he is the only narrator and we have to take his word (loosely) if we are to follow the story. he mentions several instances where lolita approaches him (NOT seduces him) giving him the belief that she was capable of understanding how her actions would be interpreted and that she wanted him. i don't believe that to be the case at all but i do believe lolita was curious about her effect on him. and this was all humbert needed to exploit her. this is how i see sansa and sandor, to some extent. again, it's not an exact comparison but sansa's sexuality was awakening at the same time that sandor begins to become aware of his feelings for her and begins to treat her gently. i don't believe he will exploit her but he held all the power in their relationship while they were in king's landing and she spent a great deal of time being terrified of him. but she notices and responds to his strength and begins to give him the attributes of a knight very quickly when she talks about him. look at when she thinks of him while she's in the eyrie: when she is in danger or afraid, for the most part. anyway, that's my interpretation of their relationship: friends with a sexual undercurrent that shouldn't be acted on. at least not until 8 or 10 years pass and she has had a chance to experience other men's attentions and affections. they were very important to one another while in king's landing and then left. time to move on. my opinion. that's all. your opinion is different and that's ok.

1850	Little Red Riding Hood	2012-11-27	The power of Sandor over Sansa, emanates from his personality, not of a "real power" over her destiny.Because,  she could had spoken with Joffrey about what Sandor was doing with her and  she didnÂ´t.Dontos has more "real power" over her than anyone else because  he offers her release her. However, by whom she is attracted is by Sandor.By the way, I could not forget to tell you that is a real pleasure talking to you because you respect the criteria of others and support your opinions with arguments.Not to mention that you has read one of my idols: Nabokov. /happy.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='^_^' />

1851	Little Red Riding Hood	2012-11-27	Furthermore, Sansa does not remember Sandor only when in situations of danger when she wants protection. Also , she recalls him in another different and varied situations.A good overview of all of them appear in her aunt's wedding at The Eyres.Her aunt is in the marriage bed, "Singing".and then Sansa:"Sansa went down the steps and out into the night. A light rain was falling on the Remains of the feast, but the air smelled fresh and clean."  While she is in the closed room and she goes out, she is thinking about the lie that was her own matrimony.Outside, where "the air smelled fresh and clean" (and sincere) she starts thinking in Sandor:"A dog can smell a lie, you know, the Hound had told her once.She could almost hear the rough rasp of his voice. Look around you, and take a good whiff. They're all liars here, and every one better than you.She Wondered what had Become of Sandor Clegane."There, in the rain, despite the rain, she stays  thinking about him."She stayed outside for a long time."That is, it, although rain-nothing less than Sansa, who does not like ruining your clothes or your hairstyle-she stays "for a long time" where "the air smelled fresh and clean"  thinking in Sandor.Is not that something significant?

1853	Little Red Riding Hood	2012-11-28	Ah! but Sandor is alive.His uncertain fate only it is known by Brienne (who seems unlikely she finds to Sansa.)The most knowledgeable about Sandor is The Elder Brother.But, how could he tell her about it?Only if they have a encounter.(More  improbable even)
1854	Raksha the Demon	2012-12-02	The fans of Sansa and Sandor have been disappointed about how little air time the relationship between Sansa Stark and Sandor Clegane has received, going back to season 1.  Tonight, in an episode written by GRRM himself, a scene that fans of the couple have loved, was gutted.  The fleeing Sandor waited for Sansa to return to her room, and among other things, demanded a song from Sansa.  Sansa sings for him and afterwards, in the next books, starts remembering things that didn't happen, infamously, the remembered kiss.  None of this appeared tonight.Does this mean the end of SanSan?I don't think the short-changed SanSan bit in Blackwater means that the relationship is over.  It might just mean that GRRM could only fit so much into a very intense episode, and might have thought (or been told) that TV-Sansa is not as popular as Tyrion or Bronn, with or without Sandor.  The SanSan relationship in the book is compelling, riveting drama.  The TV series left out what was most important, in my opinion; that Sansa touched the Hound, touched his face and touched his heart; and he was a man who had been known much pain and was filled with anger, and it meant a lot to him.  He had sexual and emotional feelings for her; but did not act on his sexual desire (thankfully).  He also watched out for her and gave her some valuable advice at a time when she was not only absolutely alone but in danger.  Sansa came to rely on Sandor as perhaps the only honest man in  King's Landing; and someone she knew cared about her; and that was worth a lot to her.   And he'd saved her from rape and possibly worse (as the TV series did show).  Post-Blackwater Sansa was starting to focus on Sandor in a romantic way; and he seems to figure in her burgeoning sexuality.  Do I think that Sandor is going to be Sansa's knight in a blood-spattered white cloak, and will come to her rescue and carry her off to Clegane Keep or post-Bolton Winterfell or Pentos?  Heck, no.  At least probably not.  Sandor is an alcoholic emotional mess; and until and unless he learns to control his personal demons, he's not fit to be any woman's mate, much less a girl who, when we saw her last in AFFC, was not yet 14.  In some ways, Sandor was younger than Sansa; his personal emotional development seems to have been permanently stopped in adolescence, while Sansa's development is hurtling forward by leaps and bounds; in ASOS she is emotionally scarred and more mature than Margaery's giggling cousins (some of whom are a bit older).  Sandor and Sansa have had a tortured, powerful relationship that meant a lot to both of them.  It is not a relationship we would want to see between a girl aged 11-12 and an angry, violent soldier in his 20's in our time, but in GRRM's world, the relationship did have ultimately positive results for both of them.  Whether, if they meet again (and I think they will), a hopefully older mid-to-late-teens Sansa can love a hopefully more mature and controlled Sandor and he be able to treat her well, remains to be seen - he may not find a more experienced girl/young woman as appealing as the little innocent girl he knew in King's Landing; and she may not find a more subdued, gentled Sandor as attractive as the passionate and powerful warrior she knew.   Knowing GRRM, they'll meet again shortly before one or the other is killed.

1855	Woman of War	2012-12-02	I agree with you Raksha - who would have thought!
If or when Sansa and Sandor might meet again Sansa might be shrewd and cunning in a darker way Littlefinger- or Cersei-like. This would not appeal to Sandor anymore, they might even end on opposite sides of the game. I do not believe that Sandor will return to mindlessly serving  the ruthless power side again so if Sansa should end there....
Or Sansa might become an independent young woman who knows what she wants and then she would not be the little bird anymore that touched Sandor's heart. But he might still fight for her and save her life.
But I think that Sansa will simply outgrow Sandor like  a warm beloved children's coat, like a surrogate parent where you learn to keep a distanced yet caring relationship when you mature.

1856	jons nissa	2012-12-02	By the way, I could not forget to tell you that is a real pleasure talking to you because you respect the criteria of others and support your opinions with arguments.Not to mention that you has read one of my idols: Nabokov. /happy.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='^_^' />thanks! i enjoy discussing characters and plots politely, even if i'm passionate about something. i'm not a fan of "that is not possible" or "you are not reading it correctly" type of statements. grrm has said that he purposely is writing with hints, clues and vagueness to encourage discussion while avoiding saying things with certainty. sansa is really interesting to me at this stage of the story. i would love more open dialogue about her but that is difficult at times.anyway, i adore nabokov. i think it's part of an overall love for russian writers. lolita is a big favorite of mine.
1857	Little Red Riding Hood	2012-12-11	Thank you. Yes he wrote marvelously, talking about this has made me remember a plot that really has many points of contact with Sandor and Sansa relationship, "Lady Chatterley's Lover" Have you read it? (Of DHL the great friend of my beloved Aldous Huxley)Of course: the characters of Sandor and Sansa are more intense, better written, STRONGER, for that reason  I like so much ASOIAF:Their characters are so alive, so Pure Flesh and Blood.

1858	Little Red Riding Hood	2012-12-11	Also, I remember,both they called  to each other : bird and dog(even, another character compares at the gamekeeper with a dog). "His soul" is bitter at first.His eyes and his smile twisted look like those of Sandor.Even, the way that both they touch and look to each other before becoming lovers is similar.

1859	willowbark	2013-02-09	I noticed that as well.  It was as if George was trying to say he intended more of a daughter-ish/protector role as the core of their relationship...not a romantic one.  He is drawn to her innocence, he wants to protect her, but it's not a sexual attraction.I always thought Sansa later remembering a kiss that never happened was just her childish tendency to romanticize everything trying hard to stay alive.  She's terrified of the Hound and in no way attracted to him, yet she recalls him kissing her?  Sounds like a random firing out of one of her beloved songs about Knights saving Ladies.Sansa was one of my favorite characters to read from the very first book, and I never ever thought of there being any romance between them until I came to this forum, where it seems to be considered a given.  I think that when he wrote the books, he had certain relationships in mind, and was surprised at how readers may have interpreted them.  Maybe he has asked the show creators to give a better sense of what he meant by those relationships.  I remember watching one interview where he talked about the fact that he considered Dany and Drogo to be a great love story - I didn't quite get that from the book, but it seemed that the show made more efforts to make that visible.  I think the SanSan relationship may also be one of these situations, where the show is trying to clarify the need for the Hound to protect Sansa, rather than the perceived romantic relationship.  I think if the show was going to go for a more romantic vibe for the couple, they may have gone for a younger looking actor for Sandor, to reduce the liklihood of the ick factor of modern sensibilities of the age factor. Also, my take on the doll falling to the floor was that it may be the nod that she is warging Sandor, which is a pretty big theory on the explanation of the kiss that never was, as I understand it.
1860	Le Cygne	2013-02-09	Some reviews of the episode/show:Also, I think that fact that The Hound is clearly in love with her, in a Beauty/Beast sort of way, helps endear her to us.- IGNSansa and the Hound! Sansa and the Hound! I have to admit that the scene where Sansa finds Sandor in her room after he leaves the battle is one of my favorites in all of the books. (I'm a 12-year-old Beauty and the Beast fan at heart.) I only wish we could've seen more of them together throughout the season.- Chicago TribuneWhy, oh, why wouldn't Sansa go with The Hound at this point? Their shared scenes have always been a pleasure to watch, but none more so than their final one last night. (Though he never asked his little bird for a song, did he?)- TorSansa argues that Stannis won't hurt her, which the Hound quickly explains that yes he will, he's a killer. Like him, like Ned, like Robb. And to look him in the face so she can get used to seeing men that killâ<U+0080><U+0094>they're all around her, making the world what it is. She looks at him and is no longer afraid. He's the Beast, and she's Belle, and gosh, he's just gruff because he's scared! Tale as old as timeâ<U+0080>¦ song as old as rhyme!"You won't hurt me," she realizes."No, little bird, I won't hurt you." But he will leave, and does.- Hey, Don't Judge MeBut while Bronn distracts himself with a presumably hired lady love, Sandor keeps a rather affectionate candle burning for Sansa. Perhaps making a reference to flame isn't exactly appropriate, considering that Sandor was scared enough of the fire to desert his post. But that does bring up another subtle contrast between himself and fire-starter Bronn, doesn't it?- TV OvermindBut as fire raged outside King's Landing the Hound finally had enough, handing in his tersely memorable notice and pausing only to offer sanctuary to Sansa on his way. Sadly his little bird rejected his offer â<U+0080><U+0093> but their surprisingly tender scene provided a brief respite amid the death and destruction.- The GuardianI never thought it would be possible, but the Hound made me tear up a bit. His conversation with Sansa was so heartfelt. Their relationship has been building up to this, but it was still surprising. Will Sansa get out with him in time? Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m guessing that she will be too late once again.- CliqueClackThe Hound is obviously soft for Sansa - I think she represents a pureness and innocence he can never possess, and of course there is her beauty, such a beauty that it reminds the Hound of his inner and outer ugliness, and so she becomes a kind of symbol of all things clean that he feels motivated to protect, and yet Sansa refuses him.- (Not So) DailyAnd Sansa, wellâ<U+0080>¦sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s clearly getting much better at manipulating Joffrey, and her scenes with Cersei, and most notably the scene with the Hound (Rory McCann) were some of the best weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen with the character.- What CultureSandor Clegane (Rory McCann) surprised us in this episode. His "eff it all" attitude, drinking and his offer to take Sansa (Sophie Turner) away were at the top of the list. He's clearly had enough of his employer and doesn't care who knows it. We must say, we probably would have fled with him if we were Sansa.- E OnlineAgree or disagree with Martin, you have to admit he makes his point very well, and scenes like the Hound advancing on Sansa to tell her that all men she knowsâ<U+0080><U+0094>or will knowâ<U+0080><U+0094>are killers and that the world is made by killers are at once beautiful, mesmerizing, and horrifying.- AV ClubThe attention Martin paid to Sandor and Sansa's subtext-ridden relationship was nice. Sandor seemedâ<U+0080><U+0094>for the first time in this seriesâ<U+0080><U+0094>a real living, breathing person, and Rory McCann was finally let out of his cage and allowed to do his thing. That final scene in Sansa's chamber was delightfully scripted, acted, and shot, and I loved the slow confidence in Sansa's eyes when she stared up at him and said, "You won't hurt me."- TV Equals"But he arrived, Stannis (who deserves major props for walking the walk; he was the first of his men on to land and on to the ladders) was defeated and we're left to wonder if Tyrion is alive; where Sansa is off to with Hound; and how the King's Guard will react to its highness as a coward.- TV FanaticDespite his burned and battered visage, he's no monster, merely a man sickened by all the hypocritical, monstrous things he's seen other, supposedly better men do to one another... With the water on fire and his life on the line, Sandor Clegane used his one good eye to take a clear-eyed look at the real cost of other people's games and did the most reasonable thing of all: He walked away.- GrantlandHaving abandoned the battle, he offers to take Sansa with him, returning her to Winterfell, an offer she momentarily rejects but seems to relent to in the end.  OR DOES SHE?!- ScreencrushHe offers to take her back to Winterfell and to protect her, but she refuses, still saying how much she loves Joffrey. That's when the Hound gets real with her, looks her straight in the eyes and explains that he's not playing games, he's being 100 percent honest. He will keep her safe and she doesn't need to keep lying and pretending to love Joffrey. And it seems to work.- Buddy TVWar forces us to consider our allegiances, and in that battle the Hound realizes that his King is not worth protecting with the flames nipping at his heels. That he feels differently about Sansa says something about the character, something the show has been subtly laying the groundwork for all season.- Cultural LearningsThe Hound doesn't say much, but the show has done a good, subtle job of letting us know what Sandor Clegane thinks of Joffrey's treatment of the "little bird."- Huffington PostSansa is almost raped before being rescued by the Hound, who takes care of things in his usual brute force fashion. But his affection for Sansa is obvious ("I didn't do it for you," he tells Tyrion)- AV ClubI loved finally seeing a bit of interaction between Sandor Clegane and Sansa. While he may not look the part, he is quite the knight in shining armor.- TorJust as it's about to get really horrible, the Hound shows up, disembowels one, snaps another guy's neck and kills the third one leaving the last guy cowering in the corner. He tosses Sansa over his shoulder and tells her, 'You're all right, Little Bird." I think he likes Sansa. He brings her to the castle where Tyrion frets over her (because he's ultimately a gentleman) and then thanks The Hound, who is all Honey Badger about it. "Don't give a shit if you're proud of me. Didn't do it for you."- Hey, Don't Judge MeI was glad to see that Sansa didn't relent, but fought back, despite being outnumbered and outmatched. The horror of the near-gang rape scene was keenly felt in her terror and distress and the savage and uncaring masks of her attackers, seeing her as something to be destroyed, to be bloodied and used, to be cast off like garbage. It's the Hound, of course, who comes to her rescue, the "monster" who is far more civilized than his masterâ<U+0080><U+0094>or anyone, reallyâ<U+0080><U+0094>would give him credit for. (In fact, it's the fourth time the Hound has saved her: last season, he chided Joffrey when he made Sansa stare at Ned's rotten head on a spike; he saved her from a beating when he told Joffrey that Sansa wasn't just being superstitious when she made the comment about his name day; he gave her his cloak when Joffrey orders her stripped in the throne room.)Upon seeing the frenzy of the crowd, the first thought that Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) has is of Sansa's safety, but he's thinking in far more pragmatic terms, seeing the Stark girl as a bargaining chip, a hostage, a pawn. It's not the Hound's perception. He sees Sansa as a "little bird" whom he saves from the hungers of the crowd, bringing her back to the keep so she can be returned to her "cage." His sense of honor and morality is at odds with both his "freakish" appearance and his own use of brutality. Rather than just save Sansa, he disembowels one of her captors and slays them all gruesomely.

1861	Little Red Riding Hood	2013-02-11	But while Bronn distracts himself with a presumably hired lady love, Sandor keeps a rather affectionate candle burning for Sansa. Perhaps making a reference to flame isn't exactly appropriate, considering that Sandor was scared enough of the fire to desert his post. But that does bring up another subtle contrast between himself and fire-starter Bronn, doesn't it?- TV OvermindI didnÂ´t realize this, but yes, the show subtly play with this parallel between the "ladylove" and fire, even the girl and Bronn keeps a conversation about his facial scar and how a member of his family made him the scar.
1862	Craven Mummer	2012-05-29	When Tywin finds out Arya is not in King's Landing his reaction will be fascinating. 
Let the condescending lecturing and bitch slapping begin!
(null)
1863	Sarnius	2012-05-29	I think Twyin knew Arya was with him.
When he was speaking to his bannermen, he said "And a Young Wolf is at my doorstep".
1864	mhout005	2012-05-29	I think Twyin knew Arya was with him.When he was speaking to his bannermen, he said "And a Young Wolf is at my doorstep".I think he meant Robb Stark.
1865	Sarnius	2012-05-29	I think he meant Robb Stark. Could've meant Arya too. Robb wasn't exactly marching up to Twyin for battle though was he? Also he said 'a'.
1866	Noelle Snow	2012-05-29	I think he knew Arya wasn't who she said she was but I sincerely doubt he knew she was Arya. He'd have never left her in Harrenhal if he'd known who she was.
1867	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-29	Tywin wouldn't have left Arya in Harrenhal if he knew who she was. He suspected her to be a Northern highborngirl, but not important enough. Had he known Arya Stark was missing, well.. He might have known she was Arya.
Cersei will get it hot I guess. And Tyrion, him most of all.
1868	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-29	I'm looking forward to seeing him walk all over Cersei and Joff. And Tyrion.
1869	Keep Shelly in Athens	2012-05-29	so wait, we didn't get his reaction in the books?
1870	Arkash	2012-05-29	In the book, Arya never approachs Tywin.
1871	Ser Giant	2012-05-29	Arya wasnt his cup-bearer in the books.
1872	AegonTheUnlikely	2012-05-29	I can see Tywin being quite angry at Cersei.  Tyrion, however, had no part in it.  Arya was gone before he ever got to King's Landing.  This one's on the Queen Regent, all the way.
Unless Tywin, in a characteristic move, blames Tyrion regardless of the circumstances, because he just hates him that much.  I don't buy it, though.  Deep down, he knows that Tyrion is his son, and is the most like him of his children- which is why he refused to speak to his own sister for months after she told him as much.
1873	Reposado	2012-05-29	When Tywin finds out Arya is not in King's Landing his reaction will be fascinating.Let the condescending lecturing and bitch slapping begin!(null)hadn't thought about that. if they do a slow, silent realization, it will be amazing
1874	Pellaeon	2012-05-29	I hope for Tyrion he will be unconcious when Tywin find out who he left in Harrenhal, with Gregor Clegane. Cercei is his favorite daughter so he will probably blame Tyrion for not telling him what happend. But after the changes in the TV series he could hold Cersei and Joffrey responsable for this. But who ever will face his reaction, may the old and the new gods be with them
1875	SerMixalot	2012-05-29	well cersei and joff are to blame for letting her go
cersei joff and tyrion are to blame for not finding her and not telling Tywin
I suspect nothing will be said of Arya
1876	Perin Stone	2012-05-29	I think Twyin knew Arya was with him.When he was speaking to his bannermen, he said "And a Young Wolf is at my doorstep".If this turns out to be true, I will never watch another episode.
1877	Ser Hippie	2012-05-29	There's no way he would leave her at Harrenhal if he knew who she was, she's the 1a/1b of Lannister prisoners value-wise next to Sansa.
I'm also eagerly looking forward to him finding out.
1878	Lord Balbi	2012-05-29	If this turns out to be true, I will never watch another episode.hahahaha! I intend to agree. I guess the writers only wanted to put the viewers on edge. It doesn't really make sense comparing to what we know it's coming.
1879	Greywolf2375	2012-05-29	There's no way he would leave her at Harrenhal if he knew who she was, she's the 1a/1b of Lannister prisoners value-wise next to Sansa.I'm also eagerly looking forward to him finding out.almost forget leaving her, if he had actually thought she was Arya he would have had her grabbed almost immediately because of who she is.   And then that would have been a fun reunion when he produces Arya and lets Cersei figure out a way to lie out of it.
1880	Ferrum Aeternum	2012-05-29	I think Twyin knew Arya was with him.When he was speaking to his bannermen, he said "And a Young Wolf is at my doorstep"."At my doorstep" implies that the Young Wolf was nearby, i.e., outside with arrival imminent.If he'd meant Arya, I believe he'd have said " A Young Wolf is in our midst" or something along those lines.
1881	BlackTalon	2012-05-29	How did Tywin react to the news that Arya is missing when he comes to KingÂ´s Landing in the books? CanÂ´t really remember that or even if it happened.
1882	Pellaeon	2012-05-29	How did Tywin react to the news that Arya is missing when he comes to KingÂ´s Landing in the books? CanÂ´t really remember that or even if it happened.There was non because he believed she was dead, but in this case he met a highborn girl who looks like Arya, because she was it
1883	DurararaFTW	2012-05-29	And Tyrion was unconcious for quite a bit of time following Blackwater so his initial reaction couldn't have been depicted.
1884	Mulled Wino	2012-05-29	"at his doorstep" is likely referring to robb's proximity to casterly rock
1885	towerofjoy	2012-05-29	It's telling that Tywin spoke to Arya about the importance of family and legacy but never mentioned Tyrion, just Cersei and Jaime. But I agree that deep down he knows Tyrion and he are more alike that the twincest twosome.
His sister Gemma (think that's her name?)  comments on this to Jaime later on. Be so ironic if C/J were a certain someone's spawn. Don't believe this particular theory - but who knows...
1886	Darth Pipes	2012-05-29	I'm looking forward to seeing Tywin's reaction when he finds out Arya is not in King's Landing.  Book Tywin would NEVER admit that he screwed up though.  He's not about to allow any blame, doubt or ridicule of his abilities to get around.
Considering Tywin apparently has Littlefinger's transporter, I'm surprised he doesn't return to Harrenhal.  He took all of two days to reach King's Landing with his party!
1887	Sidonie	2012-05-30	There is another possibility here. Cersei may find a young girl who pretends to be Arya Stark for her.  Tywin may never in fact know the real Arya is missing.
1888	SpaceChampion	2012-05-30	Tywin mentioned Robb is at Ashemark according to his latest reports.  That is "on his doorstep" in relation to Casterly Rock, for sure.
1889	KC_Accidental	2012-05-31	I think Twyin knew Arya was with him.When he was speaking to his bannermen, he said "And a Young Wolf is at my doorstep".That is ridiculous. Why would he not do anything if he knew? Anyway I seem to remember him saying "THE young wolf" which obviously implies Robb. In fact it doesn't even imply, it just plain is. Why would a little subtle nod to knowing about Arya have any relevance in a conversation about whether to march to Kings Landing or not. The dilemma was having 2 foes to worry about. If Robb wasn't a worry then they'd already have been off to Kings Landing. The whole scene was to make you think he was marching on Robb, not Stannis. And certainly not to let viewers speculate that he knows about Arya.
1890	FloredaA—	2012-05-31	As soon as the news that Jaime has escaped reach King's Landing, Sansa and Arya's value as hostages will drop, and more important political issues get a priority. Sansa's only value becomes what legitimacy she can bring to whoever the Lannisters choose to support as a warden in the North, and as a younger daughter, Arya has even less value.
1891	Tytus	2012-05-31	Tywin mentioned Robb is at Ashemark according to his latest reports.  That is "on his doorstep" in relation to Casterly Rock, for sure.Yeah, I don't even know how there is any argument here. Robb is nicknamed "The Young Wolf."This is like Joffrey mentioning "his dog" and someone wondering if he meant Gregor... use you context clues people.

1892	SerMixalot	2012-05-31	for me this issue is a huge plot hole created by the season's changes.  If Tywin finds out arya is not at KL, his reation should be "She is at Harrenhall, bring her immediately to KL"  whereby he will find out she escaped Harrenhall.  This would naturally result in Tywin ordering a bunch of heads removed.  If it is never discussed it will look queer.  I suspect it wont be discussed
1893	HouseLark	2012-05-31	for me this issue is a huge plot hole created by the season's changes.

I suspect it wont be discussedMy expectation is that Tywin will ask to see the Stark girls and Cersei will have to confess Arya is missing. You'll see a glimmer of recognition flash across Charles Dance's face but he won't say a word (Tywin would never admit even an error not of his own making). He might pay an angry visit to the maester and send a raven to Harrenhall telling Gregor to detain the (unnamed) northern cup bearer. Tywin will be told she can't be found. That will be the last we hear of it. It's information that Tywin does not need to share and therefore will not and it will be a small victory for a Stark over the most powerful of the Lannisters.Saying that, if Kevan also has similar thoughts then we might see it discussed between him and Tywin. I expect that will be a short conversation...
1894	bikie	2012-05-31	I would love to see Tywin's reaction to some how realizing that was Arya (there's no way he knew) and seeing his reaction to Joffrey as well. I'm sure it won't take long for him to realize his cupbearer would have been a more compentent king than his grandson....
1895	RobertOfTheHouseBaratheon	2012-06-01	I think he'll see littlefinger and quietly enquire whether he'd met Ned's daughters, when LF says he has Tywin will give him the stare of death then move on and demonstrate to Joff & Cersei whos actually in charge. Don't think we'll see this till next year though. I can't see them visiting KL or Stannis next episode especially with Tyrions fate in the ballance. It'll be Winterfell and Dany heavy with probably a look at Robb as they love him.
1896	Volantis	2012-10-14	I think Twyin knew Arya was with him.When he was speaking to his bannermen, he said "And a Young Wolf is at my doorstep".Young Wolf = Robb StarkAnd Arya was inside harrenhal not at the doorstep

If word of Jaime's escape has not yet reached King's Landing, then surely the subject of how to get him back will come up...at which point, someone - preferably Cersei - will have to tell Tywin that they "misplaced" one of their bargaining chips. After that, I don't think it'll take him too long to put two and two together.Of course, it's entirely possible that this simply won't come up, but I had hoped for some closure to that particular storyline. I would also love to see the look on Charles Dance's face when/if he figures it out. /drunk.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drunk:' />
1898	I'll pay the iron price	2012-10-16	Tywin would never have left her at Harrenhal if he'd known who she was - especially in the care of Gregor Clegane!!!!!!!
1899	once you go black	2012-11-11	I didnt get why it had to be Tywin and not Roose [like it was SUPPOSED to be]
1900	AlQohoric	2012-11-11	I didnt get why it had to be Tywin and not Roose [like it was SUPPOSED to be]We get deprived of the pleasure of seeing Ser Amory get marched into the bear pit.
1901	The Key Is Patchface	2013-01-14	I think Twyin knew Arya was with him.When he was speaking to his bannermen, he said "And a Young Wolf is at my doorstep".Pretty sure he meant Robb
1902	Genevaman	2013-01-18	I didnt get why it had to be Tywin and not Roose [like it was SUPPOSED to be]I believe it was to establish Tywin as a character more. Most of what we know of Tywin in the books is gleamed from the inner monologues of Tyrion and the twins. With TV, you have to show rather than tell. Also, the relationship between Arya and Tywin was one of the few changes in the series that I'm actually glad they made. It humanises Tywin and made for a much more compelling character interaction than Weasel and Roose.
1903	drigoly	2013-01-19	Could've meant Arya too. Robb wasn't exactly marching up to Twyin for battle though was he? Also he said 'a'.Robb was at the doorstep of his castle&home casterly rock, he clearly meant Robb.
1904	Ramsay Gimp	2012-05-28	This was Sandor Clegane's best episode of this season, and probably of the series so far. He seemed so ferocious and hateful"Any man dies with a clean sword, I'LL RAPE HIS FUCKING CORPSE!!!!"  /cheers.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cheers:' />
1905	The Last Reyne	2012-05-28	Yeah, they have kind of glossed over him this season, but GRRM wrote this episode and he really brought the Hound to fore. It was great to see as the Hound is an interesting and complex character that has not really gottenhis due this season.
1906	Chalkius Stark	2012-05-28	He was awesome. That line you quoted, and also 'Fuck the King'
1907	addie	2012-05-28	I did regret that his fear of fire is not really explained. I am not sure that non readers understand his behavior.
1908	Tony Soprano	2012-05-28	He was great. I would have preferred if they spent some more time on San/San, but it was still great.
Especially after he left the battle, the way he talked with Joffrey, that made me laugh.
" Fuck the King " /lmao.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lmao:' />
1909	shadowspace	2012-05-28	I did regret that his fear of fire is not really explained. I am not sure that non readers understand his behavior.I'm not really a "book reader" but in season 1, episode 4 (Cripples, Bastards And Broken Things), at the Tourney, Littlefinger mentioned to the Stark girls who the Mountain was and how the Hound got his scars.

1910	BlackTalon	2012-05-28	I am pretty sure that most non-book people can figure out why a man with half his face burned away would be in no hurry to ride into a raging inferno.
And yes, FINALLY the hound gets something resembling real screentime and more than his average three and a half words per season.
1911	Crown	2012-05-28	I just saw the screentime list and the Hound has the most this episode. He was great: 'fuck the king!'
1912	sumpthy	2012-05-28	I did regret that his fear of fire is not really explained. I am not sure that non readers understand his behavior.They have gone into his backstory. They also re-established his fear towards the beginning when he shied away from a guy waving a torch about (the scene when Joffrey, Tyrion, Lancel and Sandor are on the battlements), and then again when he threatened to strangle the archer with his own guts.
1913	White Raven	2012-05-28	I was disappointed that he seemed afraid of two little bonfires. There was not enough burning city for me. (Yes, I know it's the budget but still...)
1914	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-28	He has massive balls to say that to Joff's face and then stalk off. + Westeros points for you.
1915	Honey Badger	2012-05-28	I love that he finally got to use his "LOOK AT ME!!!!" line.  More subtle here than his audition tape, which is fine.  As for his fear of fire, it's been spoon fed to the audience half a dozen times.  They can't beat it into their skulls any further.  At this point they have to know or they haven't been paying attention.
1916	Triskan	2012-05-28	I'm pretty sure that The Hound cut two people completely in half. 
I don't like killing in real life, but I very much like The Hound killing things on my TV screen.  /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
1917	Freya	2012-05-28	I did regret that his fear of fire is not really explained. I am not sure that non readers understand his behavior.Well, me and my brother are non readers ( though I started the first book a few days ago ) and when we saw that fire scene we were both like " Yeah, getting your face shoved in a fireplace by your older brother, when you're just a kid, can get any person traumatized " Really loved all the Hound + fire scenes <3 Great episode.Have some more faith in the non readers ;D
1918	erolyn	2012-05-28	So, so happy with the Hound this episode. I've been missing his character development all season.
1919	WinterfellRose	2012-05-28	Watching The Hound on screen was the best part of this episode for me. He was great with Bronn, awesome fighting and especially his expressions when his fear of fire finally got him. Watching the wildfire explosion, he was actually silently mouthing 'Oh my God'....At first I was hugely disappointed with his scene with Sansa but I've calmed down. I wished it was portrayed differently, have her at least cup his cheek or make it more vague if she actually went with him but what can you do... If GRRM wrote it, there must have been good reasons for the change.
1920	Triskan	2012-05-28	Here is a review from a non-book reader at Grantland who gives The Hound his due:http://www.grantland...ur-wife-wont-doAnd most of all, what will become of the Hound? As the season marches inexorably to a close and the various remaining heirs and claimants continue their slow, sad slog toward a meaningless prize, it fell to a ruined man to see the folly at the root of it all. Clegane isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t even a knight, yet he wields the most powerful weapon in all of Westeros: the ability to say enough. At the close of Game of Thronesâ<U+0080><U+0099> best hour, heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s suddenly a surprise contender for the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s greatest creation.
1921	Caro99	2012-05-28	he was great!! i love rory and he was finally allowed to show some resemblance to the sandor book version and to his fantastic audition. i'm so happy he had the most time on the episode, and even if i wish they had kept a closer adaptation with the san/san scene, he was great with what he was allowed to do. he fought really cool and i can't wait for his scenes with arya next season! XD
1922	Buckwheat	2012-05-28	I think his scenes were great in this episode. I think I lost half of Tyrion's speech on the battlements because the fear in his eyes when he saw the torch. It is interesting that they established some sort of competitiveness/hate/whatever that was between him and Bronn.
I hoped Sansa would sing for him, but I think I can live with the change,
1923	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-05-28	I absolutely LOVED Rory Mccann in this episode!!  Loved seeing the Hound have his breaking moment and telling Joff to fuck off!
YEAY SANDOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
how many other men could say that to Joff's face and walk away?  And live? 
Awesome HOUND!
1924	Istari	2012-05-28	Here is a review from a non-book reader at Grantland who gives The Hound his due:http://www.grantland...ur-wife-wont-do...you quoted something that went something along the lines of 'one of the show's greatest creations"(referring to the hound)  hardly HBO's creation haha /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />

1925	Envie	2012-05-28	Like many, I am a big fan of the Hound and all the symbolism that goes along with his story. He's always been a dark horse hero for many of us and I absolutely love the actor they've chosen and he is doing a fantastic job of bringing The Hound to life through this amazing critical episode in the story.
I was also disappointed Sansa did not sing for him as it was in the books, I even thought I read an interview snippet saying she was nervous about singing... so I was expecting it. I guess the tiny bit she sang of a hymn was all we're getting. Boo. /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
1926	Dornish Hen	2012-05-29	I love The Hound and I am always grateful for any screentime he gets. Go Hound!!  The thing I was most surprised at was that The Hound has friends to have dinner with. Who knew?
1927	Mulled Wino	2012-05-29	No complaints here.  The Hound went all Hound and killed it.
1928	Mulled Wino	2012-05-29	...you quoted something that went something along the lines of 'one of the show's greatest creations"(referring to the hound)  hardly HBO's creation haha /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />To be fair, that guy never read the books and wont read them until after the series ends.
1929	WinterWarrior	2012-05-29	Loved the Hound, both in the books and now in the series. And the fact that his story line is being told in full in the HBO series makes me hopeful that he still has a significant role to play in books not yet written.....I would really like the San/San story to continue.

1930	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-29	Finally we saw him how he should be, judging from the books: the cold, traumatized man with just one fear, but with a massive strength whom everybody should be afraid of. Slicing people in half, screaming he would fuck their corpses if their swords would be clean etc. Can't wait to see him back in Season 3, and hopefully in the last two books.
1931	scurvy	2012-05-29	I just saw the screentime list and the Hound has the most this episode. He was great: 'fuck the king!'I just wish he had said, "Bugger the Kings Guard, Bugger the City, Bugger the King."And, had he told Sansa about how his brother burned him two episodes ago and told her if she told anyone he would kill her, it would be so much more.  The LF scene at the tourney didn't hold true.  How would LF know and why would he say it aloud publicly if he did?  Sandor would gut him.Loved the portrayal. Loved the actual use of the character.  He and Arya are going to rock next season.
1932	boojam	2012-05-29	An amusing thing.
There is an very recent interview on the web with Sophie Turner (google it)
She said when left in change she was a bit afraid because she says she can't sing, but gave it her best, she's fine.
Any way so we didn't get the Sansa/Sandor song, I don't think because Turner can sing.
On the other hand Rory McCann can.
He brings his guitar to all the shoots.
So he could have sung for her!
Had to smile when Bronn and guys were singing, in came the Hound who apparently never sings.... 
So it goes.....
1933	Kittykatknits	2012-05-31	It was nice finally seeing Rory bring the Hound to life!!! He was amazing in this episode. The lines were great and all very in  character, which makes sense as Martin actually wrote this episode.
Loved seeing him walk in to the brothel and all conversation stops. He then kicks two guys out of their table and takes their drink too which I thought was a nice touch.
I think his line, "Fuck the kingsguard, fuck the city, fuck the king" might be the most epic line of the show that wasn't taken from the books.
Can not wait to see more of him.

1935	bikie	2012-05-31	I could watch spinoffs of the hound and bronn, as well as arya and tywin... the actors were fantastic and the chemistry was amazing... I'm hoping jamie and brienne have the same sort of chemistry... haven't gotten it from that pair yet that I have from the aforementioned...
1936	Ghosteline	2012-06-01	I can't even say how much I loved the Hound in this episode - and what a great acting job by Rory - I mean to make a fear look so obvious on your face! I could really feel his terror! I love The Hound character so much as he has very strong opposites in him, which makes him so dynamic and interesting and somehow you don't know what to expect. On one side he is a brutal emotionless killing machine and on the other hand he must have been one of the most honest men in Kings Landing and seemingly the only one who understood how wrong Sansa was treated. He kind of laughs at world. In a way his view of life might seem so dark and wrong and yet, I feel as if its right and honest and seeing through all the false glitter. And of course that little tender spot he has for Sansa just revieles his honesty and some kind of kindness he has inside. Its just so interesting to see the clash of this kindness and anger he has in him. Just love him!!!!!!!!!!! And Rory is hot!!!!
I was expecting also a bit more from the SanSan scene.... but the soft spoken words from the Hound... were just melting me ...so... worked for me! /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
1937	Free Northman	2012-06-01	I was disappointed that he didn't dominate Bron in that confrontation they had earlier in the episode. In fact, here you have the most feared fighter in Westeros and Bron is ready and apparently very confident of taking him down without a sweat.
And the way they made the scene play out it seemed as if Bron had the upper hand, with his hand on his secret dagger in the small of his back and the Hound apparently unaware of it.
I really felt that this was an opportunity to establish the Hound as a whole new level of warrior above the common sellsword Bron, but that they let it slip.
For example, it would have been great if Bron actually whipped out his dagger, only for the Hound to catch his wrist and crush the dagger out of his grasp.
Instead, Bron comes off as the more savvy, and the scene where he later sees and laughs at the Hound in his moment of fire weakness hammers it in even more.
Totally the opposite of what it should have been, which is that the Hound is absolutely supreme except when faced by fire.

They left me with the impression that they are both pretty big Bronn fanboys.
1940	Plaguewalker	2012-06-02	Loved, loved, loved The Hound in this (and always, but nice to see him getting his due at long last screentime-wise). I think the fear of fire was explained well with his expression (awesome job, Rory) as the wildfire erupted, as well as him telling the pyromancer that he better not let any "of those fuckin' flaming arrows" get near him.
I was disappointed, however, with his exit. It seems every week we get minutes upon minutes of Tyrion being pithy and Cersei talking about her scheming (is it really such great scheming if all you do is talk about it? This is a point that has bothered me many a time) and Joffrey being a sociopath, but I felt this was the one time all season where The Hound deserved to be front and center for not just the battle scenes and the brilliant "Fuck the king" moment but also his final interaction with Sansa.

(And no, I did not intentionally stalk you on Westeros today, I just happened to be drawn to the same threads, surprise surprise.)You bring up a good point about how much screen-time  many of the other characters tend to 'eat up'. I don't claim to know a ton about them, but from every little bit that I've seen of behind the scenes stuff and interviews, D&D (the showrunners) seem to be almost....well.....reveling in creating as close to possible their 'preferred' version of this story.They seem to not just include, but also to amplify the things that they especially like about the story. Fair enough. I'm sure we'd all do the same if we had the chance to run the show! For instance, my preferred fan-version would probably be one giant road-trip with all the Stark kids + Direwolves learning life lessons, Hodor Hodoring, Hot Pie being Hot Pie, Tommen + kittens(!) being too stinkin' adorbs to die, the Hound swearing and raging and acting 'not ungently' now and then, Tormund Giansbane making 'member' jokes, Jaime and Brienne being badass, and even.... Dunk and Egg tagging along for some anacronistic/ Time Travel episodes . /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />That said, D&D are HUGE fanboys of Tyrion and subsequently include him in almost every single episode so far, and also ....they  do tend to 'white-wash' Tyrion a bit (I wonder what they will do with his scenes starting from ASoS onwards, as he starts slip into his own Dark Side little by little.... ), at the expense of other characters. I shudder to think of how they will portray poor Sansa during her forced marriage to Tyrion! /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />Because of this, I can't help but feel skeptical that some of D&D's choices about characterization (what and how much they choose show of the characters as they are written in the books) is influenced not just by the text, or by how much time they have per episode, but also by deliberately choosing what they like and don't like from the text.Some of it is of course based on what they think will work well on television vs on the page, but I think they are greatly underestimating their audience here as well as the potential of the tv series.For example, the HBO series has so far completely ignored a very prevalent theme: the concept of "True Knighthood". This theme greatly affects Sandor's character, as well as many others such as Sansa, Jaime, Brienne, etc. throughout the story, and is important enough to GRRM (and to the understanding of his created world) that it is even one of the main themes of this prequel Dunk & Egg stories as well. While the theme may not seem to directly affect major plotlines (and may be why it was omitted from GoT show), it affects character development big time. Surprise, surprise, it is noticeably the character development )aside from a few 'choice' characters) that is sorely lacking in the tv show, at least in my eyes. /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />Sorry for the tangent....where was I......Oh yes, Rory McCann. /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' />  The Hound. /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' />  (The Power of this character is such that even the watered-down tv-version makes me fling my undergarments across the room swoon. /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' /> )

1942	Plaguewalker	2012-06-02	HODOR! (As in, "I agree completely and totally with everything you have ever said.")
You are spot on about them tossing the whole exploration of "true Knighthood" to the wind to the detriment of the show overall. That's another thing that has rankled me. Someone I know who didn't read the books was describing the show to someone else as "kings and boobs and killing." Many a time that's what I feel the show has been reduced to, though apparently, by the ratings, they're doing something right to please a great number of people.
Gotta go to work now...will be thinking of other things...other brawny, irritable things...for the next 12 hours, though... /drool.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drool:' /> I do love brawny and irritable things.
1943	The_Spanish_Inquisition	2012-06-02	In the book, The Hound was much scarier (and drunker) when he was in Sansa's chamber.  I really liked how Rory McCann portrayed a kinder gentler Hound in that scene.  Unfortunately, throughout the show The Hound hasn't had enough time to really show his true nature, good and bad.  This episode finally gave him the time to shine!After this episode, my friends finally understand my Hound love.   /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' /> /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />I read all the comments about this episode before I saw it, and I will admit I was convinced I would hate the Sandor/Sansa scene, but actually I loved it. I think the vulnerability Rory shows in the Hound makes it easy to forget the brutality of the book scene, and it's still just as powerful, IMHO anyway. We've already seen him angry - time to see him scared and seeking comfort.I have to wonder if Mr. Martin wrote that scene in such a way as to specifically to make Sandor seem more sympathetic. I know he has said that he was surprised that readers felt so deeply connected to Sandor, and that he didn't really intend for him to come across as a heroic figure. I'm curious if reader/viewer opinion of Sandor is changing his opinion or plans for him.
1944	I'll pay the iron price	2012-06-04	Yes, the Hound rocked in the Blackwater episode.
Rory Mcann played the part wonderfully!
1945	camradio	2012-06-04	purely epic, nothing else to say
1946	Plaguewalker	2012-06-04	I watched Blackwater again last night (I haven't been able to watch the final ep yet...so no spoilers, folks!) and I remembered something that I particularly love about how Rory plays The Hound. Note: this is not fangirl squeeing, just an observation from someone who has both fenced and practiced Northern Shao Lin Kung Fu for years. I don't know if this was his idea or his trainer's or what, but I *love* how he stands "at attention." Soft-knees, toes out. Like an actual warrior ready to fight, not an actor waiting to deliver his next line, standing the way he imagines a big brutal swordsman would stand. Huzzah!
That is all. Carry on.

1950	Batman	2012-06-11	You can really tell that GRRM wrote this episode. The Hound speaks much more like he does in the books. Strong and fierce and hateful. Plenty of curses
I love Tyrion but it was awesome to see the Hound put him down. Eat shit dwarf, classic
1951	Elder Sister	2012-06-11	Sandor Clegane has always been my fave ASOIAF character.  Like several have already said, I was a bit disappointed that the Hound's disdain of knighthood and all of the hypocrisy he sees in King's Landing hasn't been brought out more, but that is my only complaint.  Rory McCann is brilliant as the Hound.  I loved him in The Book Group and I love him in GOT.  He's just a fantastic actor.My favorite moment in the Blackwater episode is immediately after the wildfyre explosion.  The camera pans to where Tyrion, Joff, Hound, and crazy alchemist codger are standing.  The only two people to recognize the enormity of what has just happened are the Hound and Tyrion.  You can see on their faces how horrified they are to witness men burning in the bay...the other two just look thrilled.I cannot wait to see Rory M. and Maisie Williams in their scenes as Sandor and Arya.  Good times!

Plenty of cursesI love Tyrion but it was awesome to see the Hound put him down. Eat shit dwarf, classicAgree, but...I wanted more from the Sansa scene. I loved how drunk and unhinged yet vulnerable he was in that scene in the book. You really had a sense what a troubled yet not evil character he was. I thought the tv scene was almost like an afterthought. But yeah, he was terrific overall. Cannot wait for next season when my two faves (Sandor and Arya) get to have their scenes. Those bits by far were my fave interactions of the entire (book) series (tho I've only read through FFC).
1953	Yvonesan	2012-06-16	And yes, FINALLY the hound gets something resembling real screentime and more than his average three and a half words per season. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />  Way too interesting a character to be kept in the background so much of the time. And especially when Rory McCann does such a perfectly wonderful job too. It was such a pleasure to finally see a reasonable amount of screen time for the Hound and I'm so glad that it was GRRM handling the script.
1954	Valkyrja	2012-06-16	Agree, but...I wanted more from the Sansa scene. I loved how drunk and unhinged yet vulnerable he was in that scene in the book.

Cannot wait for next season when my two faves (Sandor and Arya) get to have their scenes. Those bits by far were my fave interactions of the entire (book) series (tho I've only read through FFC).Totally, agree, Plaguewalker. I dearly wish the Sansa bedroom scene could have been more like it was in the books -- it is one of the most memorable scenes with the Hound for me (out of many), especially from ACoK. It is also one of my favourite scenes from that book, so I may be biased. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />I think the only reason GRRM didn't write that scene (or any of the Hound's scenes in that episode) to be closer to how it was in the book is that the Hound's character in general has been majorly toned down for the Tv series. This is most unfortunate, as Rory McCann's audition tape for the role had him playing a version of the Hound that was MUCH closer to the books (more angry, etc.), so we know that he could have done it easily. It was the other writers and the showrunners who chose to change the Hound's personality from angry and raging to a calmer, toned down version who doesn't even mention anything cynical about knights /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' /> (*sadface* because the whole true knighthood concept is one of my favourite themes running through the series). I'm not sure why they chose to portray him this way, other than perhaps some silly need to make him seem more 'sympathetic'? Ah well. Sadly, though, this meant that GRRM had to write the tv!Hound in the Blackwater to be as close as possible to his version of the Hound and yet still make sense within the framework (or lack thereof) that they had already set during the previous episodes. This is why the Sansa scene seemed so lacking in comparison with the positively *explosive* scene in the book --- TV! Hound was quieter and calmer all around, so was subsequently quieter and calmer about deserting during the battle. Yes, he was scared of the fire, but he was shown to just sort of calmly stroll out of there. TV!Hound  was similarly never angry and raging to Sansa in the (sadly few) previous scenes they'd shared, and so to make him suddenly explode like that in the final scene would have seemed, of all things (absurdly, to us book readers)...out of character.This but one of many examples from the second season of GoT where the tv!character seemed so changed as to almost be like totally different character. (Sorry to sound like a book purist but given that some of these characters have been near and dear to my heart for over a decade now, I can't really help it.)

We know what happens in the original scene but as you say Valkyrja, tv!Hound was a lot calmer than his troubled counterpart in the book. I think GRRM still gave us the same outcome from it on screen i.e. the Hound never intended to hurt Sansa and Sansa comes to realize this; she's the only one he came to after the battle where he can just be himself and to reveal that he's leaving; he offers her the only real protection that she's ever had since her father died (although Sansa doesn't realize it), an escape from the dangerous plots in KL (life with LF/Tyrion don't ever truly do this).

Specifically:1.) The scene where he leers at her when he comes to fetch her after Ned has been arrested.2.) The way he steps toward her when he says, "No, it gives me joy to kill people."Sandor's a very large, intimidating, and scary looking guy. And though they've mellowed him out for the show, they also cut the few scenes in ACoK that were so integral to their dynamic and their budding sense of trust in each other. Also keep in mind that Cersei had just been regaling Sansa with stories of what happens when men get their blood up in battle. So, yeah, she had reason to be afraid when she retreats to what should be a safe place for her to discover this huge scary drunk guy splattered with blood and gore hiding out in her room.I don't know if it's been mentioned but I got a interesting vibe from the delivery of Sansa's line, "You won't hurt me." It's not only a recognition of sorts on her part, but also like she's reminding him that he won't hurt her. Sort of "I know you're a BAMF and you get off on killing people, but there's nothing in you that ever will purposely hurt me. Immirite?"Does that make sense?
1957	Juliads	2012-07-29	I just wonder what they are going to have the Hound rambling on about in Season three during his travels.  It might come across odd or out of character to have him speak almost obsessively over his "little bird"  since the tv show removed almost all traces of his feelings for Sansa, dammit... /tantrum.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':tantrum:' />
I was also a viewer-before-reader, and i found this site already wondering what the connection, if any, was between Sansa and the hound.  Whatever the tv show removed, it left enough to allow viewers to sense something was building between them.   The outcome of tv bedroom scene was the same as the original, but i personally found the book version to be much more memorable and very touching.  Feeling his tears in the dark, so sad...
1958	Yvonesan	2012-07-30	Thanks for the non-reader opinions, good to hear them! I suppose a guy waiting for you in your room in the dark (never mind a member of the Kingsguard in Westeros with more than just a reputation for killing) is reason enough to be afraid. It's still interesting to hear how it came across to those for the first time when compared to the original scene in the book. I don't know if it's been mentioned but I got a interesting vibe from the delivery of Sansa's line, "You won't hurt me." It's not only a recognition of sorts on her part, but also like she's reminding him that he won't hurt her. Sort of "I know you're a BAMF and you get off on killing people, but there's nothing in you that ever will purposely hurt me. Immirite?" Does that make sense?Yes. I don't believe he'd have hurt her, especially since he's offering his protection in taking her with him to bring her home but I think the recognition on Sansa's part that he won't hurt her and her voicing it aloud is important in the timing of it. She says it to him after he has just reacted to her belief that Stannis won't hurt her, with him trying to get it into her head that everyone around her is a killer and she has to get used to that fact and work out who she can trust because of it. The "you won't hurt me" comment is virtually as good as an admission that she knows she can trust him with her life. I just wonder what they are going to have the Hound rambling on about in Season three during his travels. It might come across odd or out of character to have him speak almost obsessively over his "little bird" since the tv show removed almost all traces of his feelings for Sansa, dammit... /tantrum.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':tantrum:' />I'm anxious over how they proceed with it too. And not just in relation to Sansa either, I don't want him to be dismissed as an important less-than-major character or his scenes relegated to almost non-existent compared to the book. He's too unique a character to do that fairly. A significant part of his journey with Arya in S3 does reveal his regrets and concerns over his "little bird" and I can't imagine that it will do the story any justice to remove that. Especially considering what happens to the Hound at that very point towards the end of season, if it's to pan out similar to the book story. If the scriptwriters don't care much about his character though, they could very well not give much attention to the story he does have. Let's hope this won't be the case. It's one thing I almost hate that GRRM does i.e. make you care so much about characters even without their own POVs!

I understand the need to dial down the Hound's more OTT behavior for the screen (else they risk him coming across as unlikeable and psychotic as Joff) but they could've written S/S scenes in such a way as to convey the impact these two characters have on each other without the problematic aspects of the book scenes (swords to throats and so on). That they chose not to include most of S/S's book scenes leads me to believe they don't see Sandor as a very important character in the story they're wanting to tell. I hope I'm wrong but I'm preparing myself for the possibility that Arya and Sandor's road trip will be drastically different than what was on the page. /frown5.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':frown5:' />
1960	Yvonesan	2012-07-30	I'll be trying to prepare myself for that possibility next season too.  I agree with what you say... I think GRRM did a good job in his episode last season considering what had already been done to Sandor Clegane (and Sansa) but I couldn't help but get the impression that the Hound's story was overall being relegated to insignificant on screen. I find that very difficult to accept when the character is so interesting AND the actor playing him is so good and fits the part so well.
1961	TheRedPriest	2012-08-16	GRRM really gone into The Hound's depths on this one.
Also, the acting was great, he fights so desperatly, you feel his terror.
And the scene with Bronn was worth the episode by itself...
1962	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-08-27	I am hoping the positive viewer response to the Hound's presence will finally convince DnD what a gem they have with Rory Mccann as the Hound and finally bring his character to the forefront next season with Arya.
As they've already butchered the SanSan bits.....are they going to completely cut out Sansa's fantasy that he kissed her that night?  Multiple chapters have her dwelling on an event that never happened.....which makes me wonder if that will be addressed in the show.
With the scenes as they stand currently, it doesn't make sense for her to be repeatedly thinking back to him kissing her
1963	Arya The Assassin	2012-06-01	Empire has posted a 26 minute long audio interview with the director:Neil Marshall Game Of Thrones PodcastWinterIsComing.net has posted a few quotes from the interview:â<U+0080><U+009C>Blackwaterâ<U+0080><U+009D> director Neil Marshall on nudity and creating the battleQuote:A notable section of the discussion involves the showâ<U+0080><U+0099>s use of nudity and â<U+0080><U+009C>sexposition,â<U+0080><U+009D> an aspect so notorious it was lampooned by SNL.

1964	Catastrophe	2012-06-01	I really hope that "particular executive" stops working on the show.

1966	victim	2012-06-02	It actually makes me really uncomfortable that there is an executive producer who represents "the pervert side of the audience." While I don't have a problem with nudity when it is used appropriately in scenes which require it, I have a problem when it is used gratuitously and in scenes where it doesn't add much. Take for example, the Littlefinger scene in Season One where he tells the story of Brandon and Catelyn; it was completely gratuitous that such a scene would take place when really his monologue should have been more than enough to capture the audience. That there is a T&A producer breathing down director's necks to include such scenes is unforgivable. The scene in question I don't think was particularly bad, as there's plenty of reason to believe that Bronn would like a prostitute on the night before a large battle, although it was gratuitous in the way it was shown. What I mean is that for a producer to approach Marshall about the shots he is choosing and urge him to film full-frontal nudity is quite disturbing. I believe that just because someone is naked in a scene doesn't mean they have to show everything. I couldn't help but feel sorry for the poor actress who had to sit there naked while such a good scene took place.
1967	BlackTalon	2012-06-02	I couldn't help but feel sorry for the poor actress who had to sit there naked while such a good scene took place.AFAIK that "poor girl" with Bronn is "Sahara Knite", a professional pornstar (saharaknite.org, avast doesnÂ´t like that website and blocks something, anyway be advised it is very NSFW) She probably would have let the whole roomful of guards bang her on screen without a second thought if the money was right.I have to admit, though, that I was negatively surprised that sort of thing is handled in such a blunt and crude fashion. We have always suspected, of course, that there was some pressure to include some nudity, but this is worse than I would have thought. Unfortunately it shows in the series.One can only hope that the overwhelmingly negative feedback from the fans will make D&D think twice about that practice in the future. There are noticeably fewer and les crude sex scenes in season 2 at any rate, compared to s1, which is one of the few positive things to be said about this season.

1968	Wouter	2012-06-02	So, confirmation there is such a thing as "boob quota" on HBO. A shame, GOT doesn't need a bit of porn added to be successful.Another thing that did strike me during the interview is that it was Marshall's decision to send Stannis (fighting) up the battlements - the script had him "just standing there" beneath the walls, as he said. On the one hand, maybe GRRM could have done more, letting him lead the reinforcements who attacked Tyrion's sortie for example, but it does also confirm that TV/film making rules apparently demand that such characters are "action men".While Stannis' scenes were great in a way and also showed a particularly strong contrast with Joffrey, it's still a bit of a shame in my opinion that it just has to be like that on TV. As great as TV is, books are still clearly superior in many ways, in my opinion, also because they don't have to deal with design by committee and by "focus groups".

1969	Woman of War	2012-06-02	Why do people have  so many issues with nudity and sex scenes and not with bodies cut in half?!
But, seriously, there is nothing wrong with nudity and sex if it is definitely part of the story and not only added for thrills. This gets though difficult with "no nudity" clauses in some contracts and some actors being minors but showing Cersei naked on her walk of shame for example would not be gratitious but necessary, especially if her body is not fashionably perfect ( how could it after three children), showing Jaime and Cersei having sex over Joffrey's corpse is not for thrills but an important part of the story. Daenerys naked and vulnerable was necessary. So prudity would simply be wrong here. Baring a character's body means baring his soul as well, making him or her helpless or threatening and a movie can make use of it, prude decency might be wrong here.
1970	Wouter	2012-06-02	But, seriously, there is nothing wrong with nudity and sex if it is definitely part of the story and not only added for thrills.Neil Marshall just stated clearly the (full frontal) nudity in the Bronn-Sandor confrontation scene was added purely and only for thrills ("for the pervert side of the audience", as stated), on the explicit insistence of one of the executive producers (Dan or David, I suppose?).The "sexposition" scenes of S1 (mostly) also have not been well received with many viewers, particularly not the infamous LF monologue scene. No doubt, this scene was also added on the insistence of the same "pervert side" executive.IMO those scenes do detract from the show and leave open the possibility of attacks from reviewers about the shallowness of the show, aimed at horny teenagers, as a few critics have written. The source material sometimes may be threatened to be drowned by the (gratuitiously added) sex scenes, and at times the over-the-top violence as well (not that I'm complaining about the Blackwater though, hard to do that without lots of explicit violence).Sometimes serving the needs of the "pervert side of the audience" in such a gratuitious way clashes with the needs of the other sides of the audience, though.

1971	Ran	2012-06-02	Executive producer is what he says. That's Benioff, Weiss, or Doelger. He also indicated that Benioff, Weiss, or both were always around to do script changes, consult, etc.
When I was over at Magheramorne during filming of the first season, David was pretty much always present, while Dan was always around at Malta at the time, and... I don't think Doelger really gets involved quite at that level. So I'm pretty sure it's either Benioff or Weiss.
I hope Neil's frankness about what was, basically, a funny anecdote from his perspective does not lead to his not being invited back to direct again, since he actually seemed open to it.
Also, sex scenes less crude? I mean, other than the big error which was the Littlefinger sexposition scene that was all sorts of wrong, I'd have to say this season was actually even cruder about sex than last year. So... we'll see.

1972	Kittykatknits	2012-06-02	I found both seasons had their moments. The LF scene was over the top. But, the highlight for me was LF spying on a man who was receiving a BJ while spying on a three way in another room. Then, LF wipes off a prostitute's mouth a moment later. That really took the cake for me.
I don't have a problem with sex or nudity at all really when it serves a purpose. The book has sex in it but each scene adds to the development of the characters. This interview just confirmed my worst suspicions, it's added for thrills and to appease the "perverts". It's further disappointing when the nudity is so disproportionally female.
1973	PatrickStormborn	2012-06-02	I have no problem with nudity if it benefits the plot (Theon's scenes, for example). I do have a problem with nudity if it's just there for the "pervert side" of the audience -- particularly considering the ratio of female to male nudity on this show.
1974	David Selig	2012-06-02	No wonder so many of the naked scenes feel really tacked on and pointless...
 And from a practical point of view, I wonder whether it has the desired effect in terms of increasing the viewers. If your main interest is watching naked chicks, why bother with GOT, there's the Internet for you.

If your main interest is watching naked chicks, why bother with GOT, there's the Internet for you.That's my view too - I have nothing against porn, but let porn be porn and let ASOIAF be ASOIAF. There is enough nudity in ASOIAF already that is functional to the story and needs to be shown for storyreasons, they don't need to add more in such a forced way as they have been doing.On the interview: I was impressed that Neil Marshall was also solely responsible for the battering ram used by Stannis' forces, and the upside-down boat used to protect it from 'countermeasures' from the walls. I thought that was a brilliant piece of TV.

1977	jlk7e	2012-06-02	Do people really think that either Benioff or Weiss would say that they are not on the "serious drama side" of the production but rather the "perv side"?  That screams "network suit," doesn't it?
Just to clarify: I wouldn't be at all surprised if either Benioff or Weiss was encouraging directors to include more nudity.  I'd be very surprised if either of them was saying their role was to be a perv, and specifically disclaiming being interested in "serious drama."  If I had to bet, I'd say Doelger or one of the co-executive producers.

1978	Woman of War	2012-06-02	Well, we should not exaggerate: it is not exactly "pervert" to enjoy naked people. Poorly done  it only takes valuable screentime from the plot itself. But it is sad to expect nudity always going along with the norms of what is seen as attractive, especially concerning women. This leads to unnecessary restrictions concerning plot advancing sex and nudity with the main protagonists, that self-censorship of showing only conventionally attractive naked people. That's HBO: sex is not wrong, being not perfect is.
And, btw,  what about a full frontal shot of Jaime climbing into the bathtub?  /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> Definitely part of the plot.
1979	BlackTalon	2012-06-02	That is not going to happen, there is an interview of him somewhere that he gave together with Kit Harington and Peter Dinklage, and acted all horrified at the idea of being naked in front of the camera. Almost a bit ridiculously so, IMHO.

I'm hoping for a chest shot but not much else. I also would like to remind NCW that he has a backside too. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />You touch on many of my thoughts regarding nudity in the show. I am fine with nudity and sex scenes - when it adds something. With a few exceptions, I feel as if the nudity on this show has not done so. In fact, the focus on it has taken time away from plot and character development. It also concerns me that the nudity is so disproportionately female. We have had multiple sex scenes where the man does not even show his chest yet the women is entirely nude. I like that you bring up the idea of conventionally attractive naked people. Martin, in the books, uses the body and sex as a way to advance the plot and add to characterization. The scene between Catelyn and Ned, for example, showed us that we have a healthy, loving couple. Yet, that got dropped. I wonder what they will do with Sam and his pink mast later.Love the highlighted sentence.

1982	Kittykatknits	2012-06-02	Wasn't that a joke? He's done full-frontal nudity in the past.I can't find the interview, but his reaction was something like "What? Oh, god no." Not 100% but something close to that.

Neil's whole point was that the nude scene wasn't relevant to the story or characters in any way, it was added solely because some old fat rich scumbug working for HBO wanted to see tits and vag. Utterly disgusting.On the bright side, I think Neil's decision to have Stannis fight his way up the walls was brilliant. That was an amazingly epic scene, and it really made me root for the one true King of Westeros. I agree with Ran, I hope that Neil will be back to work on GoT again, he's a great director.

1984	Ran	2012-06-02	Uhm. It was an executive producer. There's only three of those who can be referred to. It was not an executive at HBO. HBO execs do not hang around on set, leaning over and telling directors what to do. That's the job of the executive producers of the show, and specifically the impression the production give is that it's D&D who call those shots.And as I said, I didn't see Doelger anywhere when I was at Magheramorne -- maybe he was in Malta, I don't know -- but my impression is that D&D are the only ones who are always on hand for shooting; Doelger's around and does his part, but I don't think he's at all as hand's-on as either of them. So... I continue to think it's one or the other of them.I don't think the "pervert side of the audience" thing is meant to suggest that the person saying it is there just for that, or denigrating the drama side of things, merely that he feels that the earthiness and sexiness of the series is a real part of what appeals and he wants to make sure that the opportunities to show it are in there ... and, sometimes, shoehorned in there even when it's not really adding anything useful beyond more T&A.I'm not saying it's a great thing or at all supporting it, but I don't think hyperbolic stereotypes are very useful here. People say stuff because they have reasons and beliefs and obligations that combine to make them say it. It's not just 'I want T&A just because I can get it', usually.

1986	Catastrophe	2012-06-02	Alright. You seem to have some very extensive knowledge of the show's production, so I'll concede your point. I was originally under the impression that the executive in question was someone from HBO unnecessarily micro-managing the series. That type of executive meddling is unfortunately very common in the television and film industries, and while I'm pleased to know that it doesn't happen on GoT, you can understand why I was initially so cynical. I also realize that the executive's comment about representing the "pervert side of the audience" may have been a joke, or a tongue-in-cheek statement not meant to be taken 100% seriously. I was jumping to conclusions, and I apologize for that, I'm just annoyed with how much gratuitous nudity and sex has been forced into the show.
It's not that I mind nudity or sex in themselves-- I recognize that some sex scenes are absolutely necessary to the story-- it's just very irritating to me when they serve no purpose and detract from the overall plot. They've also tarnished the show's reputation to some extent, as evidenced by all of the reviews, articles, and comedy sketches making fun of GoT's use of "sexposition." On a more personal level, I know several people who dislike the show and refuse to watch it because they believe it to be "exploitative trash" or something of that sort. (I had a lot of trouble convincing my girlfriend to give the series a chance for precisely that reason, and if I hadn't read the books I might have felt the same way too.) Maybe the producers think that overwhelmingly frequent doses of nudity and sex will make the show more popular, but it seems like they're sadly mistaken, since it's done the exact opposite.
For what it's worth, I didn't even mind the naked girl in the scene with Bronn and the Hound. Honestly, I barely even noticed her at all. It's more the general trend of superfluous sex in GoT that I have a problem with.

1988	Wouter	2012-06-03	I suspect that the executive producers mentioned was acting on behalf of "suits" higher up the HBO foodchain, anyway. I think that HBO knows/suspects that a not insignificant part of their subscribers demands/expects this kind of thing and they fear cancelled subscriptions if they don't cater to their wants. If that would be true, they might have instructed their showrunners that a certain amount of nudity is to be "encouraged".
1989	rickonfortheironthrone	2012-07-29	I don't much like the pointless sex scenes, but I am willing to tolerate them if they really do rope in enough viewers year after year to see the series through to its true end.
1990	Yvonesan	2012-07-30	I suspect that the executive producers mentioned was acting on behalf of "suits" higher up the HBO foodchain, anyway. I think that HBO knows/suspects that a not insignificant part of their subscribers demands/expects this kind of thing and they fear cancelled subscriptions if they don't cater to their wants. If that would be true, they might have instructed their showrunners that a certain amount of nudity is to be "encouraged".That could be true but their take on it is very telling when the nudity is female only. I mean, how ridiculous was it that Robb and Talesa's sex scene had Robb barely showing his chest and Jeyne Talesa (or whatever her name is supposed to be) baring all?And what about the significant number of HBO subscribers who watch the show for the original great story it tells ...that includes any scenes where male nudity is required as equally as that of female? If they take it far enough (and S2 was bordering on that), they could well lose those viewers too. I do realize that HBO probably prefer to keep the "pervert" side of the audience happy. How sad that it is when it affects the quality of a show. Generally I don't bat an eyelid when it comes to nudity on screen, but it's getting to me with this show and I think it's because I love GRRM's story so much and on screen there has been an increasing number of scenes where female nudity is being used for no real purpose.  I definitely have no issues with it when it's part of the original story, since GRRM deals with it in his writing as much for both sexes in relevant situations but the depiction of nudity on the show has merely cheapened it and actually does take away from the story. The scene that Ran mentions from S1 is a good example... could anyone actually take in what LF was saying? I found it very difficult to do so when the non-canon naked women sex was practically shoved in our faces. The long and the short of it for me is that it has reduced my opinion of the showrunners and made me wary of what to expect from the show going forward. What Neil Marshall said has little bearing on it since I've only just read what he said and I had already formed my own thoughts and suspicions on the matter based on what I've watched, in S2 even more than S1. I guess time will tell if the original viewers will stick with it and that's usually a challenge for any long-running show to begin with (even with a fantastic written series as the source to work from) but I'd say continued female nudity purely to keep male perverts happy is not the way to hang on to most of the audience, never mind deviating from the original work a lot when the original work is what hooked people.
1991	Silverx2	2012-05-31	Something that seemed odd to me this episode occurred when Shae pulled Sansa aside and told her to go back to her room and bar the door. At this point Sansa asks Shae to come with her when Shae responds "I can i need to say say goodbye to someone first" 
Normally you would expect that person to be Tyrion, however in this case it doesn't make much sense.Tyrion is out fighting, Shae going with Sansa isn't going to prevent her from speaking with him should he survive the battle. This leads me to believe that Shae is going off to see someone else before going to a safe place in the city, i think maybe she has been meeting with Varys possibly leading up to a setup later on where she ends up in Tywins bed.
Otherwise what is she going to do, run out to the battlements to look for Tyrion?
1992	Thendel	2012-06-01	Actually, that would be my guess: Shae would assume that Tyrion's atop the walls himself, overseeing the battle and relatively easy to find. But this does raise the question: Does Show-Shae love Tyrion to the point that she wants to say goodbye when she thinks she's going to die? Then how does Cersei buy her off in Season 4? With golden promises? If Shae loves Tyrion, she won't sell him out for riches. With threats? Show-Shae's been established as a "bad-ass prostitute" who wears a knife on her person like a professional assassin and is accustomed to pain. Somehow I can't imagine her selling out on Tyrion "just" because of the threat of further torture.
Then again, there's also the likelyhood that's she's lying to Sansa and just wants to get rid of her so she can escape the city by herself.

1993	The Last Reyne	2012-06-02	I do see her going out to find Tyrion, but I thought it was Tywin who turns Shae and she gets killed by Tyrion just before he kills his father.
1994	House Snow	2012-06-02	I suspect that they are going to make Shae 's turn more rational from her point of view, where it was kind of convoluted in the book.  I have to say after initail reservations, I sort of like what they have done with Shae character.  I find her much more interesting then the book and I think thye have managed to do it without sacrificing that much of her character.  I too think the person she wanted to see is Varys.
1995	rezor	2012-06-04	I suspect that they are going to make Shae 's turn more rational from her point of view, where it was kind of convoluted in the book.

I'm not sure if they'll change things around and/or show it in s3, but TV Shae would almost certainly be scheming to get out of Kings Landing, thinking it's just about to get taken. She was all daggered up to go. And as Tyrion is out fighting and probably dead already (as far as she knows), Varys is the most logical man to go to. Let's not forget, they're drinking buddies now. He's probably offered to help her already (in the show universe), even if it's all a manipulation. Would she be naive enough to think he'd help her escape with no ramifications though? Maybe not, or maybe yes...either way, she's shrewd enough to make her own bargains and would probably try. Perhaps she thinks he'd help Sansa escape too, and I have a hunch the writers will go for that option over Littlefinger's help, who so far has been pretty absent from Kings Landings affairs, wining and dining with Tywin Lannister and everyone else in between.
1996	ServantOnIce	2012-06-20	Actually, that would be my guess: Shae would assume that Tyrion's atop the walls himself, overseeing the battle and relatively easy to find.

Remember the show is different than the books and they may add some loving between Sansa and Tyrion.  That would create jealously and pain in Shae making her ability to sell him out for a new husband with lands and gold more lucrative.Remember a woman scorned is easy to manipulate if you focus her anger.
1997	Shahrbaraz	2012-07-22	I don't like this, it's losing it's dark theme though, Shea was a whore and that was all. She was there for the money, the moment Tyrion couldn't offer she left him. In the show their trying to excuse every characters mistakes and issues with some monologue and story from their past and how they've been wronged. It's losing it's touch, we get it everyone suffered.
1998	Katydid	2012-05-27	THAT is how you adapt an episode, and THAT is how you write these characters.Absolutely fantastic to finally see The Real Cersei emerge this season.Tyrion's humor and bravery.  The Hound's fear.  Joffrey's chicken-shittedness.  And the list goes on.Thank you GRRM.
1999	Cressit	2012-05-27	Thank you GRRM for the scene with The Hound and Bronn to set the tone for the fighting men of the episode.

2004	Bastard of Boston	2012-05-27	Please give GRRM and Lena Headey their Emmys now. They deserve them. It is known.
2005	Katydid	2012-05-27	Please give GRRM and Lena Headey their Emmys now. They deserve them. It is known.And Dinklage!
2006	Jennelyn	2012-05-27	Yes, it was definitely obvious who wrote this episode. Very VERY well done!
2007	SerMixalot	2012-05-27	GRRM should write every episode of every tv show, ever
2008	TheeMikeHoncho	2012-05-27	All I can say is WOW. It was unreal, GRRM needs to be cloned so he can write the episodes and the books simultaniously.
2009	scurvy	2012-05-27	The Rains of Castamere was awesome and even moreso in the credits.
Tyrion alluding to a wedding being the worst thing in life.  Terrific.
Varys talking about being cut and the dark arts.  Nice touch.
Everyone was pitch perfect- Tyrion, Cersei, Bronn, Sandor, Sansa, Stannis, Davos and no BS in the other parts of Westeros and Essos despite the credits map.
Totally blown away.
2010	SerMixalot	2012-05-27	wow, just wow.
THAT is how it is done.
Well done HBO.
2011	kwak76	2012-05-27	Was this the only episode that G RR martin wrote for?
2012	SerMixalot	2012-05-27	yes
2013	SerMixalot	2012-05-27	this season that is
2014	Balefont	2012-05-27	GRRM did write a brilliant episode.  However, I gotta hand it to D&D for all that they have done to take this from book to screen and they have done a fantastic job working the source material in with the various constraints.  I don't think enough people give them the credit they deserve and that's a shame.
2015	zippypoodle	2012-05-27	Absolutely fantastic to finally see The Real Cersei emerge this season.The problem is that show Cersei is a better and more interesting character than book Cersei. Book Cersei is practically a Disney-villainess and pretty much Martin's worst-written characters, especially once she gets a POV. The non-Martin writers have improved on Cersei as far as I'm concerned.I'll just write it off as the stress of the situation and the wine bringing out the worst side of her.

If any of the writing or producing would have offended him to the extent that we read about here, I am absolutely positive that he would have withdrawn. Instead, he is writing in the parameters of what has already been written a good portion is not exactly like he wrote it in his books. D&D has done a brilliant job of setting us up for this climax.

2019	Lord Godric	2012-05-27	THAT is how you adapt an episode, and THAT is how you write these characters.Absolutely fantastic to finally see The Real Cersei emerge this season.Tyrion's humor and bravery.  The Hound's fear.  Joffrey's chicken-shittedness.  And the list goes on.Thank you GRRM.I agree hands down about Cersei.  THAT is how Cersei should have been all along on this show.  THAT is Cersei.  Unhinged, emotional, fearless.  I wish she would always be written like that because that is how the character really is.  I guess only Martin knows how to do it though, because it does it beautifully!

But, I'm going to throw in that the way Cersei has been altered (for the better) on the show makes me appreciate this more erratic version. I think, at the end of the day, I appreciate how Cersei isn't one dimensional. In the books, she tends to be that way. The show started with her being much cooler -- much more aloof and shrewd. I enjoyed that. And, now you have a desperate and drunk Cersei in Blackwater. I don't like to talk about GRRM's Cersei in this episode and D&D's Cersei as two different characters -- as I'm seeing right now. For me, they both compliment one another...the show's Cersei is wonderfully nuanced.

2023	Tourniquet	2012-05-27	I give the other writers the benefit of the doubt. Its obvious that this was the best episode by far and it really is no wonder...this is Georges child and he treats it well.
2024	King Tommen	2012-05-27	I agree that Martin did an amazing job and it stands to reason because a) he unquestionably knows these characters and this world better than anyone else and /cool.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='B)' /> he's a fine screenwriter in his own right.  But also take into account that Martin was gift wrapped the episode with the most dramatic impact, had the most action, climaxed many of the threads that had been set up earlier in the season and had 10x the budget of any other episode so far on the show.
He also was allowed to have an entire 60 minutes devoted to one location and not have to jump around from one spot to another trying to cover off 7-8 different completely disparate plot threads which often make other episodes seem disjointed.  The other writers can certainly learn a lot from Martin but they had to do a lot of the heavy lifting in order to set up this episode for Martin to knock over all the pins.
If you want to look at how Martin does on a level playing field, you can check out "The Pointy End" which is his Season 1 episode, structured in a much more conventional sense.  It is a very strong entry but I wouldn't necessarily say the best of the season and it didn't stand out significantly from the episodes immediately before or after (which were all excellent IMO).
2025	dayman	2012-05-27	GRRM needs to write everything on the show even if it means the books take longer the writing was so superior to other episode it wasn't even funny

This was unquestionably the best episode. But it is also unquestionably the best possible episode to write, especially for Martin. GRRM gets his rocks off on this type of stuff. He knocked it out of the park, lets hope Valar Morghulis is a fitting end!

2028	House Martell	2012-05-28	I have not liked Lena Headly's Cersei until tonight. she was amazing in this episode. The writing was SO noticeably better, I'm sorry but the other writers should be embarrassed after seeing "Blackwater". Cersei and Cat have been very watered down so far but this gives me hope for the future (of course now there's only 1 episode left, and will have to wait a year).
The San-San scene was near perfect, I never fully got it, but that made it so clear

2030	kimo333	2012-05-28	thank you grrm for making grrm a bitch
2031	The Other Knight	2012-05-28	People do realize that Cersei was acting this way because she was drunk and afraid for her and her children's lives right? The character was just like she has been the entire show, especially during the final scene. She wasn't written any differently.
2032	Night Gathers	2012-05-28	With all these positive remarks I'm really looking forward to watching this episode!
2033	Eggplant Wizard	2012-05-28	Bronn, the Hound and Cersei were great. I thought Tyrion was slipping a bit this season but that was a good episode with him, it felt more like the real Tyrion.
2034	Seprious	2012-05-28	Risking parroting every other post made here...
Hands down best episode of the season.
2035	Brucolac	2012-05-28	The Rains of Castamere was awesome and even moreso in the credits.That was a nice choice using the National for that.
2036	DornishKnight	2012-05-28	And Dinklage!And Alfie!
2037	Golden Twin	2012-05-28	THAT is how you adapt an episode, and THAT is how you write these characters.Absolutely fantastic to finally see The Real Cersei emerge this season.Tyrion's humor and bravery.  The Hound's fear.  Joffrey's chicken-shittedness.  And the list goes on.Thank you GRRM.Agreed to the fullest. A faithful and brilliant episode which accomplished so much in the confines of budget, production etc. Amazing writing by GRRM. Goes to show that the shit they have been pulling this season which cannot be explained by production constraints and seem to be dumbass writers' attempt at showing off is unacceptable. Seriously sack these imitators and let GRRM write everything.
2038	teemo	2012-05-28	Yeah I'm glad he got things under control a bit, D&D were running wild with their fanfic. It's just like GRRM to put in a lot of Sandor, Sansa, and Rains of Castamere.  LOVED IT.  I felt like I was in the books again...haven't felt that way since season 1.
2039	Ran	2012-05-28	Howdyphillip,I am absolutely positive that he would have withdrawn.I don't think so. There would doubtless be contractual penalties and such, so why do it, really? He's remarked on authors who decide to get all offended after the fact when they knew what they were getting to. He has his hopes, he thinks it'll work all right and that D&D will do their best, but if the show ever steps off a cliff... well, he still has the checks, and hey, the books are over there on the shelf, just as he meant them to be.
2040	Honey Badger	2012-05-28	For those who are saying GRRM should write every episode, just remember why television shows are written and directed by a team, not a single person.  Last person to try it alone was Aaron Sorkin, and that involved a whole lot of cocaine, and it didn't last long.  Yeah I'm glad he got things under control a bit, D&D were running wild with their fanfic. It's just like GRRM to put in a lot of Sandor, Sansa, and Rains of Castamere.  LOVED IT.  I felt like I was in the books again...haven't felt that way since season 1.He okays the scripts so he's aware of any severe changes.  Like it or not, he signs off on this stuff.  It's not fanfic, jesus what hyperbole.  Plus he's contracted to write one episode a season, so it at least needs to flow in line with what he writes.  It's not like HBO will kill Brienne prematurely, then GRRM gets in a huff when he sends in his Brienne episode and goes: "Holy shit, what did you guys do?!?!?" He's not getting blind sided by anything.
2041	teemo	2012-05-28	He doesn't have to sign off anything, he doesn't have veto power or something....they can do whatever they want.  Maybe fanfic is a bit of hyperbole, but I still think he really turned things around this episode.

2042	Khal-a-bunga	2012-05-28	Wow, some of you guys are beyond fanatical. This isn't even the best-written episode of the season (What Is Dead May Never Die). However there's no point in arguing with purists, so I'll leave it at that.
2043	HouseLark	2012-05-28	Wow, some of you guys are beyond fanatical. This isn't even the best-written episode of the season (What Is Dead May Never Die). However there's no point in arguing with purists, so I'll leave it at that.I agree. The writers of this show have done a bang up job of adapting a massive text. However, what is clear is that the other writers don't seem to understand the characters of Sansa and the Hound. Both were magnificent in Blackwater and for just about the first time I felt real character development from them.
2044	Howdyphillip	2012-05-28	Howdyphillip,I don't think so. There would doubtless be contractual penalties and such, so why do it, really?

I could see him not making public comments against it, but it is hard for me to believe that he would continue to contribute.

However there's no point in arguing with purists, so I'll leave it at that.De gustibus non disputandum estbut  i didnt have theese thrills this season untill nowi think that GRRM had the best episode on hand of the season and he put it 1000% above what was the rest of the seasoni dont get how to compare to What Is Dead May Never Diethis is ASOIAF not Tullisa/ Ros / Dragon thiefsnow leave GRRM get back to his Book writing as he isnt that young and i dont his pupils to finish the series in his place as he was taken by the Many Faced God

2046	Stag's Fury	2012-05-28	The question is, which episode should GRRM write next season?
assuming RW is in season 3, I'd say it's 100% that GRRM will be the one writing that episode?
and in season 4, maybe that certain battle up north?
s5/s6 is gonna be tough, early-mid AFFC/ADWD is a bit slow paced.
2047	hombay	2012-05-28	Class difference between writers to be honest, GRRM is such a bloody beast! /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
2048	BlackTalon	2012-05-28	That was a nice choice using the National for that.What is "the National"? Non-US/UK member here.
2049	Crown	2012-05-28	King George, of house Martin, first of his name.
2050	Brucolac	2012-05-28	What is "the National"? Non-US/UK member here.It's the band that performed the Rains of Castamere in the credits.
2051	Currawong	2012-05-28	I don't think he will write the RW.  He has already spoken several times about how difficult and painful it was for him to write the chapter in the book, so I think he will hand it over to someone else, and do another episode.

I suspect we would not see near the amount of praise that we are getting from the purists.Whilst i agree this was one of the best episodes of the season, i think the main reasons for this is the nature (and budget) of the episode. D&D obviously love G.R.R.M's books and have done a fantastic job so far, and have even improved on some of the things from the books. This series is at the very least one of the best shows on Television right now, and the lack of appreciation on this website for anyone but the author is irritating to say the least.

I think this was a fantastic, extremely strong episode, which kept more in line with the book while allowing for cuts to be made. I hardly even cared about the changes, because everything else in the episode was so immense. This is my opinion, that is yours. No need to be insulting. If you don't think GRRM is an incredibly amazing writer, then why are you here?

Some of the writing for this show hasn't been as good as the writing in the books as well, but I would still stress that overall, the writing has been excellent, and in some places absolutely inspiring. This episode would not have been nearly as epic as it was if the writing leading up to this didn't set it up so well.

I suspect we would not see near the amount of praise that we are getting from the purists.D&D got their praises when it was due in season 1, then they decided to stick us with the cheesy end.
2058	JW.	2012-05-28	D&D got their praises when it was due in season 1, then they decided to stick us with the cheesy end.Agreed, they did a fine job last year. This year it was just not up to par to that, and they got flak for it... let's hope they will follow the season 1 route with season three.It's no suprise to me that Both episodes written by GRRM are the finest of the two seasons so far.
2059	Le Cygne	2012-05-28	I agree, this episode was a beautiful adaption of the book. 
It is possible to stay with the books and create a wonderful television experience.
Because he not only did it, but far exceeded every other episode this season.
2060	Lord Rayder	2012-05-28	It was just fantastic...the wildfire, seeing a glimpse of the real Hound, the Cersei and Sansa interactions, Tyrion being awesome, Stannis being badass and yet shouting as he was taken away in sadness, the battle scenes....
Oh, and the Rains of Castamere by The National in the credits. The National are my favorite band, and to hear them play TRoC is just...awesome beyond belief.
2061	Maria Underfoot	2012-05-28	Can't he just write every episode? Of course, he should focus on TWOW, but I'm sure he could manage it!!!
Such an amazing episode, it stood out, showing just how talented Martin is, and how he can instantly make a difference compared to the other episodes. Brilliant dialogues, great character developments, hilarious lines. ("QUARTERMAN" was fantastic)
Bravo, and I hope that if he can't write all the episodes, he can at least be present and advise the other writers.
2062	Sxxman	2012-05-28	To be fair, this episode did have the biggest budget out of all the episodes by far, so it was much easier for him to recreate Blackwater as close to the books as possible.  I think that a lot of ya'll are overlooking that fact....not to mention the Battle of Blackwater and Ned's death were the climax in both the books...
Don't get me wrong GRRM did a great job, but he did have much more to work with in this episode than D&D had in any other episode.

2063	Greywolf2375	2012-05-28	GRRM did write a brilliant episode.  However, I gotta hand it to D&D for all that they have done to take this from book to screen and they have done a fantastic job working the source material in with the various constraints.  I don't think enough people give them the credit they deserve and that's a shame.Just so it gets said again.  I have my complaints and nitpicks about what I have liked and haven't liked, but what they have done to take this from how everyone has imagined these scenes to look to what they have created is quite an amazing accomplishment.
2064	Howdyphillip	2012-05-28	It is possible to stay with the books and create a wonderful television experience.I was going to write out a list of all of the changes from the book to the television show, but you can pretty much go scene by scene and find them. My point is that this episode has as many changes as any other episode of the season, We would just look pretty silly talking about how GRRM doesn't know anything about these characters.
2065	fede989	2012-05-28	Oh here we go.Look, GRRM is the boss. I think this was a fantastic, extremely strong episode, which kept more in line with the book while allowing for cuts to be made.

If you don't think GRRM is an incredibly amazing writer, then why are you here?There's a great difference between thinking that GRRM is a great writer, and being a fanatic, that would turn everything that he does into some holy grail of perfection, while lambasting every other writer that dares to change even the minor thing of the books to make the best adaptation possible, because "they don't understand the novels" The arrogance.

My point is that this episode has as many changes as any other episode of the season, We would just look pretty silly talking about how GRRM doesn't know anything about these characters.You give certain people a big enough battle with enough violence to orgasm over and nothing else will matter to them.It was a good episode, but not the pinnacle of all TV ever like some are making it out to be.
2067	zippypoodle	2012-05-28	There's a great difference between thinking that GRRM is a great writer, and being a fanatic, that would turn everything that he does into some sacred grail of perfection, while lambasting every other writer that dares to change even the minor thing of the books to make the best adaptation possible, because "they don't understand the novels" The arrogance.Sage post.
2068	Katydid	2012-05-28	To be fair, this episode did have the biggest budget out of all the episodes by far, so it was much easier for him to recreate Blackwater as close to the books as possible.  I think that a lot of ya'll are overlooking that fact....not to mention the Battle of Blackwater and Ned's death were the climax in both the books...It didn't cost GRRM a single penny of any budget to write the characters properly. My main issues with this season has been not so much with the changes to the story, but the changes to some of the characters.  The softening of Cersei is my biggest gripe, with the Evyl-fying of Joffrey a close second.  Having him become the mastermind behind the slaying of Robert's bastards was atrocious.  Book!Joffrey is a spoiled idiot who is ultimately unimportant to the bigger picture (except in how his death pushes Cersei further into batshit territory.)  I saw no need to try and make him some uber-villain him for the series, nor waste precious screentime on his need to watch two whores beating each other. Watching Cersei bow her head contritely, cowed underneath his 'I could hang you for this' threat was equally painful.I felt like George got the two of them, specifically, back on track with 'Blackwater'.  Seeing Joffrey racing to hide behind his mommy's skirts in the heat of battle is the Joffrey I've wanted to see all season.  Watching a sadistic Cersei sitting with her youngest son on her lap, ready to poison him to death, as well.  I thank GRRM for delivering.

I thank GRRM for delivering.Cersei was vulnerable in this episode too, when she was drinking with Sansa and at the very end, not that much different from what we've seen so far (except GRRM wrote this episode).   With regards to Joffrey, he was always a cowardly character in the series, this episode didn't bring that Joffrey back, he was always there (GRRM did write this episode).  I understand we all have opinions and interpretations but I really didn't see that much difference in these characters in this episode than in previous ones.
2070	Howdyphillip	2012-05-28	You give certain people a big enough battle with enough violence to orgasm over and nothing else will matter to them.It was a good episode, but not the pinnacle of all TV ever like some are making it out to be.Oh... Don't mistake me. This was the best episode of television that I have ever seen in my life. All I am doing is pointing out that this episode had as much or more changes in it than any of the other episodes. The characters were even drastically changed in places.
2071	StarkWard	2012-05-28	And to think that they already cut out a lot from the original script, for production reasons of course, it's quite normal. I wonder what the whole script come to life would look like.
2072	Dracarya	2012-05-28	There's a great difference between thinking that GRRM is a great writer, and being a fanatic, that would turn everything that he does into some holy grail of perfection, while lambasting every other writer that dares to change even the minor thing of the books to make the best adaptation possible, because "they don't understand the novels" The arrogance.'Fanatic' is an awful term, and inappropriate too. If I was such a fanatic, I wouldn't watch this TV show, due to all the deviations. I've never said GRRM is perfect, but I for one find myself comparing other novels to his, and after reading his level of writing, it took me a while to get into other books. That's just testament to him as an author, and for spending all his time on these novels. They're not perfect, it feels like we spend half our lives on here arguing about things and nitpicking, but, as Katydid said above, the real treat of having GRRM write an episode was seeing the characters as they should be, as he created them. Most other writers on this show pale in comparison in that effect. The changes, meh, I realise there were probably the same amount in this episode as the others, but the way it was written made it feel that bit better, for me. Plus, as I said, the way the characters were portrayed seemed much truer to the books. I'm annoyed about there being no chain, and while I'll bitch about changes like this in every episode, I can still appreciate an incredibly strong episode when I see one. This is one.So, thank you GRRM, for taking time out of your busy schedule to write this episode and give us Blackwater in the best possible way.
2073	leo0274	2012-05-28	George Martim should write all the episodes
2074	Mooncat	2012-05-28	The changes in the episode, I think, were much less noticeable because the characters stayed in character and the alternating points of view reminded me so much of the book.
2075	Bronn Stone	2012-05-28	Book Joffrey is about fourteen.  Show Joffrey is seventeen.  It would have been mind-numbingly stupid to write a seventeen year old Joff who is as passive as Joff in the books.  Those are some of the most significant three years in a child's life.  D&D had no choice but to age him up with the other characters, but to pretend that those years wouldn't change his priorities would have been simply foolish.
2076	Howdyphillip	2012-05-28	, the real treat of having GRRM write an episode was seeing the characters as they should be, as he created them. Most other writers on this show pale in comparison in that effect.This isn't close to the truth... Characters were drastically changed from the books1. Stannis would have never charged the wall himself. He led from the back of the battle2. Bronn and Sandor would never have gotten in a who's dick is bigger contest right before a battle3. Shae would have never gone out of her way to help Sansa... or anyone but herself for that matter.and most importantly,4. Cersei would have never... never... never considered poisoning Tommen.What happened here is that GRRM adapted all of these things so that we could get similar emotional responses as we had when reading the books. This is the exact same thing that has gone on all season.I am not saying that all of the changes this year were as good as this, Mr. Martin obviously knows just what emotional response he wants from his series and was able to adapt these things better than anyone else.
2077	KAralinda	2012-05-28	aren't we forgetting about the good work made by the director (Neil Marshall)?!?
2078	Sxxman	2012-05-28	This isn't close to the truth... Characters were drastically changed from the books1. Stannis would have never charged the wall himself. He led from the back of the battle2. Bronn and Sandor would never have gotten in a who's dick is bigger contest right before a battle3.

This episode was my favorite, but episode 6 was my second favorite but people nitpicked the changes in that one to death.  When GRRM makes changes = who cares, he nails the charactersWhen D&D make changes = ruining characters, future plotlines, they don't understand anything, the show is going downhill.If people are going to nitpick about things being in the show but not in the book (and vice-versa), then don't be biased about it and only complain when D&D do it.

2079	Triskan	2012-05-28	/agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />I can not agree with this more...GRRM is putting his name on this series. If any of the writing or producing would have offended him to the extent that we read about here, I am absolutely positive that he would have withdrawn. Instead, he is writing in the parameters of what has already been written a good portion is not exactly like he wrote it in his books. D&D has done a brilliant job of setting us up for this climax.On top of this, Blackwater inherently had the most potential.  I'm very happy that GRRM wrote it, and it was fucking great, but I suspect it would still have been a pretty great episode even if someone else had written it. I mean, George didn't exactly write the visual effects of that wildfire explosion.
2080	King Tommen	2012-05-28	It's also very naive to think that a TV episode screenwriter is solely responsible for the finished product on the screen.  Showrunners have their fingers in almost every aspect of the production of every episode, including the writing.  Scenes are often added and altered after the script has been submitted.
So if you like the episode, it seems really silly to praise Martin solely for it and not acknowledge that the entire production team (especially D&D) had a hand in putting it together.
And it bears mentioning again that a big reason why some of the characters were so fleshed out in this episode was because Martin was allowed to stay in one location for the entire 60 minutes and not have to hop around every 3 minutes to check in on the other 7-8 storylines that he covered off in his novels, a luxury not afforded the writers of the other episodes this season.
He also got a massive budget afforded to him for this episode alone that D&D went to HBO begging hat in hand for so that many of the battle storylines could be executed effectively.
He gets the characters better than anyone else, of course that goes without saying.  But somehow implying that everyone else working on this show is incompetent is ridiculous.  I liked "The Pointy End" (Martins's Season 1 episode) a lot but it wasn't the best entry that year and IMO didn't stand head and shoulders above the other great writing work done that year by everyone else.
I hope we continue to get Martin to check in every season as he does bring a lot to the table but let's be honest in saying that "Blackwater" was an easy softball down the middle of the plate for him to knock out of the park.
2081	Khal-a-bunga	2012-05-28	Oh here we go.Look, GRRM is the boss. I think this was a fantastic, extremely strong episode, which kept more in line with the book while allowing for cuts to be made. I hardly even cared about the changes, because everything else in the episode was so immense. This is my opinion, that is yours. No need to be insulting. If you don't think GRRM is an incredibly amazing writer, then why are you here?If you took any insult, that's on you - I'm just calling it as I see it. This episode was undoubtedly the easiest to write of the entire season. While I completely agree with everyone on how well-written the episode was, just because the author of the books wrote it doesn't mean it's inherently better written than any other episode. Even the books have their flaws; I'm sure Martin would be one of the first to admit that even if some of his more fanatical fans wouldn't concede to the possibility. Bottom line is that George wouldn't have allowed D&D the opportunity to create this show if he didn't have faith in their writing abilities, and given his television background and the fact that he wrote these novels to be too big for television, I'm sure he's far more understanding about the changes that have been made than many book purists.
2082	SerMixalot	2012-05-28	was GRRM comparing the previous episodes to a barrell full of puke?
One wonders
2083	SerMixalot	2012-05-28	how come i get the impression varys is trying to recruit tyrion to the targaryen claim
2084	Dracarya	2012-05-28	This isn't close to the truth... Characters were drastically changed from the books1. Stannis would have never charged the wall himself. He led from the back of the battleDramatic effect for TV, a necessary change IMHO.2. Bronn and Sandor would never have gotten in a who's dick is bigger contest right before a battleCan't really explain this one. Maybe making them seem a bit more human? Couldn't say.3. Shae would have never gone out of her way to help Sansa... or anyone but herself for that matter.Shae has already been drastically changed from the books, so this was just going along with how Shae has already been portrayed.and most importantly,4. Cersei would have never... never... never considered poisoning Tommen.You don't think so? I know it didn't happen in the books, but I think she could. It'd be out of love, in her mind, and to not give Stannis the satisfaction of wiping out the Lannister line. This is down to interpretation then, but I think it's possible.What happened here is that GRRM adapted all of these things so that we could get similar emotional responses as we had when reading the books. This is the exact same thing that has gone on all season.I am not saying that all of the changes this year were as good as this, Mr. Martin obviously knows just what emotional response he wants from his series and was able to adapt these things better than anyone else.I agree. I just think he did it better, and I don't see why people saying so gets such a shitty response from some people /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' /> I have no problem with changes that make sense, like Ros replacing Alayaya for example, and it seems that most of the changes in this episode made more sense than some of those in other episodes.

People are allowed to moan about what they want - if you don't like it, don't look.
2087	Hot Pie Targaryen	2012-05-28	I would so love to see another reality where these same fans in this thread were under the impression that D&D wrote this episode rather than G.R.R.M. I suspect we would not see near the amount of praise that we are getting from the purists.Whilst i agree this was one of the best episodes of the season, i think the main reasons for this is the nature (and budget) of the episode. D&D obviously love G.R.R.M's books and have done a fantastic job so far, and have even improved on some of the things from the books. This series is at the very least one of the best shows on Television right now, and the lack of appreciation on this website for anyone but the author is irritating to say the least.This is what I was thinking. If it was not known that GRRM wrote the episode, I predict a lot of readers would be furious about the lack of the chain, the lack of the song and kiss, and the downplaying of Renly's ghost. They would say the Hound/Bronn scene seemed forced, and would probably have an issue with something from the books. Mind you, I'm not accusing people of anything, so I don't mean this to come across as negative at all. I just think it's a perception thing. Personally, I've been very happy this season. There have been some changes that I wasn't thrilled with, but overall this is easily the best show on TV right now. And has a better cast ever been assembled in the history of television? The most disappointing thing for me is that the season is almost over and the idea of waiting 9 1/2 months seems almost unbearable at this point.
2088	Faceless Sam	2012-05-28	The problem is that show Cersei is a better and more interesting character than book Cersei. Book Cersei is practically a Disney-villainess and pretty much Martin's worst-written characters, especially once she gets a POV. The non-Martin writers have improved on Cersei as far as I'm concerned.I'll just write it off as the stress of the situation and the wine bringing out the worst side of her. if you think cercei is a one dimensional villain you must have read different books than i did...

2090	dreamcatcher	2012-05-28	Agree, the characters were well-rounded, each had his or her own motivation, I actually felt for them... this is how it should've been the whole season, instead we've been watching some kind of an interpretation by D&D. We don't want new interpretations, it's all in the books, you can't get more grey characters than that.
2091	Malgarroth	2012-05-28	To be fair, this episode did have the biggest budget out of all the episodes by far, so it was much easier for him to recreate Blackwater as close to the books as possible.  I think that a lot of ya'll are overlooking that fact....not to mention the Battle of Blackwater and Ned's death were the climax in both the books...Don't get me wrong GRRM did a great job, but he did have much more to work with in this episode than D&D had in any other episode.You made a mistake there, but the correction reinforces your point.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BaelorGRRM didn't write Ned's death. And it was an amazing episode, my favorite.
2092	Khal-a-bunga	2012-05-28	You've posted that twice, and I'm still not going to answer you, because it seems like all you want is another argument. People are allowed to moan about what they want - if you don't like it, don't look.Perhaps you should take your own advice. I can share my thoughts on anything posted here same as you, and if you don't like it then don't read it. I'm not trying to pick an argument whatsoever; I simply dislike book purists and am entitled to do so, same as everyone else here is entitled to their point-of-view. Is every person who complains about the changes trying to pick a fight? I don't think so. They're merely giving their opinion, same as me. My opinion is that the show more often than not benefits from changes being made. Not because it's trying to be better than the story in the books, but because there is a finite amount of time and a finite budget to be worked with. I love the books and I love the show, but it seems it's easier for me to view them as two seperate but connected entities, which obviously isn't the case for a lot of people here.

2095	SerMixalot	2012-05-28	the actor playing Joffrey was excellent.  He really played the scared but trying to do well child king well.  Probably more appropriate for a 13 yr old than a 17 year old, but apropos for Joffrey
Would have love to see a scene where joffrey met stannis

And it was an amazing episode, my favorite.I'm sorry about that, he directed the one before that.  Don't know how I mixed them up, considering I listened to GRRM's commentary on "The Pointy End" where he kept saying that he wrote the episode (I believe he commented on "The Pointy End").
2097	Lord Godric	2012-05-28	On top of this, Blackwater inherently had the most potential.  I'm very happy that GRRM wrote it, and it was fucking great, but I suspect it would still have been a pretty great episode even if someone else had written it.I mean, George didn't exactly write the visual effects of that wildfire explosion.No, but if someone else had written it they may have decided to not show that at all.  I read an interview with someone from the show and they said they came very close to not showing the battle *at all* instead remaining inside with Cersei and Sansa and the women and having reports brought in about the battle.  If Martin's script had not called for seeing the battle we might not have seen it.
2098	zippypoodle	2012-05-28	if you think cercei is a one dimensional villain you must have read different books than i did...Please. Enlighten me on the many layers of book-Cersei. Your average bean dip has more.
2099	zippypoodle	2012-05-28	was GRRM comparing the previous episodes to a barrell full of puke?One wondersNo, one doesn't.

I read an interview with someone from the show and they said they came very close to not showing the battle *at all* instead remaining inside with Cersei and Sansa and the women and having reports brought in about the battle.  If Martin's script had not called for seeing the battle we might not have seen it.So it's your contention that the producers of the show had no intention of showing a battle at all until Martin gave them a script that had fight scenes in it and they suddenly realized that they should show it?  Brilliant. The interview you are referring to is what D&D had resigned themselves to something they may have had to show given the limitations of the budget before deciding to go to HBO for the increased funds for the episode so that they could stage a battle on some kind of larger scale.  This was long before Martin submitted a script as all of the writers would need to have a general outline for each episode provided by the producers before knowing how to structure their given hour.Are people here so obtuse as to not understand what "showrunners" do?  They are involved at every stage of the production, they aren't the HBO suits.  These guys know the books backwards and forwards and have sat down and spoken to GRRM for countless hours about the direction and plotting of the series and how to best adapt his novels.  They aren't some idiots sitting in a room waiting for Martin to tell them how to stage a TV show.
2101	Fragile Bird	2012-05-28	and most importantly,4. Cersei would have never... never... never considered poisoning Tommen.What happened here is that GRRM adapted all of these things so that we could get similar emotional responses as we had when reading the books. This is the exact same thing that has gone on all season.I am not saying that all of the changes this year were as good as this, Mr. Martin obviously knows just what emotional response he wants from his series and was able to adapt these things better than anyone else.I think I have to disagree with this point.  In the book, Tyrion has moved Tommen away from King's Landing for safety reasons, in particular I think, remembering what Gregor Clegane and Amory Lorch did to Rhaegar's children.  By keeping Tommen at King's Landing, I think GRRM is showing us, the book readers, what could have happened had Tommen not been moved, while at the same time showing the TV-only audience how ruthless Cersei can be.

2103	Fragile Bird	2012-05-28	Thats what the Illyn Payne beheading all of us if Stannis takes the city bit to Sansa was for....how do you need more than that to show how ruthless she can be.Yes, true, but the difference is, Ilyn Payne being there was in the book, and in the book Tommen was moved for safety.  By keeping Tommen in King's Landing, GRRM is telling us, the book readers, I bet you didn't think she'd poison Tommen did you, and for the TV watcher who hasn't read the books, he's clearly showing them how far Cersei is willing to go, even against her own child.  And by the way, why wasn't Joff with them?  She was willing to poison Tommen, but she'd let Stannis burn her Joffrey alive?  Well, she might not know about burnings, they may not have happened yet, but she knows Stannis will kill him.
2104	SerMixalot	2012-05-28	i think they implied she didnt know where joff was.
that scene would have been weid with joff in it
2105	The Other Knight	2012-05-28	It doesn't hurt that he got Blackwater to write. The episode D&D fought their behinds off to get made. But they won't get credit for that.
It is like Baelor last season. The best material is usually going to yield the best results.

2106	sadfascist	2012-05-28	GRRM did write a brilliant episode.  However, I gotta hand it to D&D for all that they have done to take this from book to screen and they have done a fantastic job working the source material in with the various constraints.  I don't think enough people give them the credit they deserve and that's a shame.I have tremendous respect for D&D as showrunners. It's clear that without the two of them specifically the show would only be a shadow of what it is.But as scriptwriters? Not so much.It's no accident the absolute worst scenes in GOT (off the top of my head: Theon giving Ghost to Jon, Littlefinger sexposition, Stannis introduction scene, Twyin teaching Jaime to read, anything to do with Ros or Talisa) have all been written by D&D. Bryan Cogman is a significantly better scriptwriter. GRRM blows them all out of the water.We can recognize this fact in addition to appreciating D&D for being amazing showrunners. There is no conflict; people are better at some things than others. Heh, tell that to the San San shippers. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />I for one am convinced that the only reason Sansa did not sing to the Hound in "Blackwater" was because D&D cut it out. It's inconcievable GRRM would not include this scene in his original script.Yet another poor D&D choice.(And yes, if it turns out Martin was the one responsible, then my opinion of Martin will immediately decline.)
2107	Mad Queen	2012-05-28	This episode reminded me of what I watch GoT for. I couldn't stop smiling for a long time after it ended. I don't know if the merit is all GRRM's, and certainly nobody here, even the biggest "fanatic", thinks everything GRRM does is perfect. Just head to the book forums and read the numerous criticisms of AFfC and ADwD. But undoubtedly this was the best episode of season 2 and I think GRRM deserves a lot of credit. After all he created this whole thing, we already know he can be an excellent writer. I bet a lot of people here have only read the book series recently and just don't have the same attachment to it as the others who have read and re-read it so many times over the years.
2108	The Other Knight	2012-05-28	I have tremendous respect for D&D as showrunners. It's clear that without the two of them specifically the show would only be a shadow of what it is.But as scriptwriters? Not so much.It's no accident the absolute worst scenes in GOT (off the top of my head: Theon giving Ghost to Jon, Littlefinger sexposition, Stannis introduction scene, Twyin teaching Jaime to read, anything to do with Ros or Talisa) have all been written by D&D. Bryan Cogman is a significantly better scriptwriter. GRRM blows them all out of the water.We can recognize this fact in addition to appreciating D&D for being amazing showrunners. There is no conflict; people are better at some things than others.I for one am convinced that the only reason Sansa did not sing to the Hound in "Blackwater" was because D&D cut it out. It's inconcievable GRRM would not include this scene in his original script.Yet another poor D&D choice.(And yes, if it turns out Martin was the one responsible, then my opinion of Martin will immediately decline.)They have also written some of the best scenes in the series. People like to say the first season is better, when they wrote more episodes in the first season. They wrote The Kingsroad, Baelor and Fire & Blood.And what in the world was wrong with Tywin teaching Jaime to read?

2110	HouseLark	2012-05-28	To me, the idea that Tywin of all people would spend time teaching his dyslexic son to read is absurd. YMMV.A man who can't read is at a severe disadvantage to his noble peers, they would run rings around him. Tywin would not want his heir to have that weakness, or any weakness. And I dare say that knowing Jaime, only Tywin could sit him down and force him to learn.
2111	The Unborn	2012-05-28	And what in the world was wrong with Tywin teaching Jaime to read?It wasn't in the books for god's sake!No seriously nothing was wrong with it, it was perfectly in tone Tywin and the kind of man he is. If his son can't do something, he will damn make sure he will do it.
2112	SerMixalot	2012-05-28	what is absurd is the needless modernizing by including dyslexia.
2113	Khal-a-bunga	2012-05-28	what is absurd is the needless modernizing by including dyslexia.Modernizing? You can't be serious. Please, don't be serious.
2114	DornishKnight	2012-05-28	Please. Enlighten me on the many layers of book-Cersei. Your average bean dip has more.Without taking a side, I'm going to give my impression  of book Cersei:She wants to be a man and is the epitome of the "I want a penis" syndrome.  She thinks that: she has more power than she actually has, that Joffrey is a good boy, that Tommen is a fool like his father except a coward to boot (while punishing him for daring to defy her), and that she is some sort of genius. She is actually abrasive, self centered (loves her children, HAH! Look at how she treats Tommen), paranoid, impulsive, idiotic, ignorant of how things actually work (the "power is power" scene was perfect, as far as Cersei was concerned), and sees enemies and allies in all the wrong places.The scene last episode was spot on. If you have seen the interviews, Lena Headey does not read the books.  Her opinion of Cersei's character in the first season interviews were laughably wrong.  This season was a lot closer.  What we are seeing in the show is a woman who has a facade of being in control, a schemer, and cold but we have seen it start to crack this season (I think Martin may have sent them a message).  I expect her to lose the facade as the series progresses.I have a friend who has not read the books except the first.  When I told him that we get Cersei POV's his reaction was: "That doesn't sound interesting.  It would just be reading about a genius evil schemer."   My reaction: "You know nothing! Jon Snow."Can't wait for season 4 when Lena goes batshit.
2115	The Other Knight	2012-05-28	I'm not saying D&D are bad writers, just not as good as Bryan Cogman and GRRM.

YMMV.You mean like when they had Ned warn Yoren about Arya? Yeah, I know inferior.And there are no such things Ros scenes. She has had one scene dedicated to her this entire series. The rest were Theon, Littlefinger and Joffrey scenes.And it makes complete sense that Tywin would teach his son, his heir how to read even if he hated him for it. It completely fits his character.
2116	David Selig	2012-05-28	I don't see it honestly. Yeah, it was a really good episode, but in terms of writing "Baelor" for example was just as good if not better. And it really helped Martin that he had the green light to write a whole episode only about a single plotline, which is the climactic point of the book/season which wasn't an option for the other episodes.
2117	SerMixalot	2012-05-28	Modernizing? You can't be serious. Please, don't be serious.u dont think it odd that they included a disease which is related to reading and writing when 99% of the population does not read or write?and then of course heroic father figure can solve that particular problemyes smacks of needless modernization
2118	Lord Godric	2012-05-28	So it's your contention that the producers of the show had no intention of showing a battle at all until Martin gave them a script that had fight scenes in it and they suddenly realized that they should show it?  Brilliant.The interview you are referring to is what D&D had resigned themselves to something they may have had to show given the limitations of the budget before deciding to go to HBO for the increased funds for the episode so that they could stage a battle on some kind of larger scale.  This was long before Martin submitted a script as all of the writers would need to have a general outline for each episode provided by the producers before knowing how to structure their given hour.Are people here so obtuse as to not understand what "showrunners" do?  They are involved at every stage of the production, they aren't the HBO suits.  These guys know the books backwards and forwards and have sat down and spoken to GRRM for countless hours about the direction and plotting of the series and how to best adapt his novels.  They aren't some idiots sitting in a room waiting for Martin to tell them how to stage a TV show.No shit.  But I remember many times seeing Martin writing about his script and wondering if they were going to be able to do it at all.  I certainly think that it is possible that if David and Dan knew that they were going to write they episode they could have made the decision to not go to HBO and request more money because they would try to make it work their way.  Knowing Martin was writing the episode and knowing he writes things much larger for television probably pushed them to decide to show the Battle instead of getting reports about it.  In their interview they admit that this episode was given to Martin because he does things big.  If he wasn't doing it we probably would have had most of the action coming in the form of reports.
2119	Rapsie	2012-05-28	Brilliant episode and the writing was fantastic. The characters felt like they were from the books, which they haven't done in recent episodes!
2120	King Tommen	2012-05-28	Well your implication was that actually filming the battle of Blackwater wasn't even on D&D's radar until Martin brought it to their attention which seems ridiculous.  If you watch that interview and others with D&D, you can see that they very much want to show these battles, were angry about having to cut Tyrion's battle last year but had to remain within budget.  There was a clear decision early on in the conception of Season 2 that they absolutely needed to make an exception for Blackwater because of how the entire season builds towards it so they went to HBO with their business case as to why they needed the extra funds to film it.
How anyone takes that interview and makes the leap in logic that Martin told them that they should film the Battle of Blackwater is beyond me.  Anyone with half a brain who has read the books knows that filming this battle would be very important which is why they took the extraordinary steps of asking for substantially more money for this one time exception.
I'm not sure where the impression that Martin "writes much larger for television" comes from.  Was "The Pointy End" written any larger than any other Season 1 episode?  The reason this episode was "big" was because it was Blackwater, not because Martin wrote it.  D&D love Martin and wanted to entrust him with a very important episode which happened to be Blackwater, not because he writes teleplays with lots of action scenes (pretty sure that's not something he's known for at all).
2121	Howdyphillip	2012-05-28	No shit.  But I remember many times seeing Martin writing about his script and wondering if they were going to be able to do it at all.  I certainly think that it is possible that if David and Dan knew that they were going to write they episode they could have made the decision to not go to HBO and request more money because they would try to make it work their way.

In their interview they admit that this episode was given to Martin because he does things big.  If he wasn't doing it we probably would have had most of the action coming in the form of reports.I work in the industry lighting TV and film, so I have a little bit of insight here. I don't know anyone from this production, so I have no real inside scoops, I am just speaking from conjecture. I don't think that HBO gave two shits who was penning this actual episode when it came down to decisions of increasing budgets. GRRM is signed on for an ep a year, so they certainly want his name at some point on the season, but they didn't pour money in an episode because of the person who wrote it. They increased the budget because it was necessary for the series as a whole. D&D would have written a different script, but they would have still lobbied to get the additional financing, and they would have written in large scale scenes as well.The only reason that D&D talked about having to write the whole thing from the perspective of Cercei was that they were afraid that the budget wouldn't come through, and that would be the cuts that they were left able to afford. That is why they say they begged for more money. To tell you the complete truth, I don't believe that they had to beg too hard. HBO knew what they had on their hands, and knew that the extra money they spent would be well worth it for all of the word of mouth and critical acclaim that they would get for the extra dough they spent. This is the kind of money that is spent that actually works for you and turns into more.
2122	Ran	2012-05-28	Just to reiterate what others have said -- D&D were definitely trying to figure out the battle, and GRRM writing the script didn't magically make it happen. What they have said is that he provided some suggestions for how to rework it to fit the budget. So I'm guessing the idea of using a surprise attack via the tunnels instead of a sally port charge with a bunch of expensive, hard-to-work-with horses was his idea, and presumably he suggested the alternative way to use the wildfire once they realized they couldn't afford the chain and would have to rethink the battle.
2123	ServantOnIce	2012-05-28	GRRM did write a brilliant episode.  However, I gotta hand it to D&D for all that they have done to take this from book to screen and they have done a fantastic job working the source material in with the various constraints.  I don't think enough people give them the credit they deserve and that's a shame.I have been a total jackass to D and D the last few weeks. Until I watched the extra features on HBO GO. I realized what a tool I have been to them and what a blessing, fortune, good thing it is to have two real fans with real talent to do the job they did.Also, I am sure they know that some things didn't work this season, no need for me are other fools to mention it.I need to chill out and D and D while they didn't write Blackwater, they did work hard on it and anyone who says they didn't just doesn't know what they are talking about.GRRM was offered more $$$$ than HBO did to do this series and he trusted D and D and while he likes some changes, some he doesn't he believes it is in good hands.I owe those guys and apology. I didn't know what on earth I was talking about, many of their critics don't.

[...]And it makes complete sense that Tywin would teach his son, his heir how to read even if he hated him for it. It completely fits his character."Baelor" was a great episode. The last scene in "Baelor" plus the Robert/Cersei chat in "The Wolf and the Lion" were great additions by D&D.Again, I am not saying D&D are bad writers. They are just not as good as GRRM and Bryan Cogman. Between the two of them Martin and Cogman are responsible for four very strong episodes with zero bad scenes. I don't think you could pick any four D&D penned episodes without encountering at least one (probably several) egregiously absurd and/or baffling scene along the lines of Ros sexposition, Talisa romance, etc.My view is that D&D do well when they stick to the source material and much less so when they try to invent storylines out of whole cloth. This is not necessarily a book purist view (though I am a purist) because Bryan Cogman's added scenes are great. I think the difference is that I can envision Cogman's scenes actually taking place in the setting of the story, and for many of D&D's scenes I simply cannot.P. S. I am wrong about the Twyin/Arya heart to heart. D&D didn't write that one, Vanessa Taylor did. My criticism still stands though.And there are no such things Ros scenes. She has had one scene dedicated to her this entire series. The rest were Theon, Littlefinger and Joffrey scenes.Ros has WAY more than one scene in Season 2, but I was actually referring to Season 1. She's better integrated this season.

Beyond your completely made up figure of the literacy rates in Westeros, you're also ignoring the fact that dyslexia - being a mild and often correctable brain defect - has nothing to do with overall literacy rates, whatsoever. Human beings have been reading and writing for thousands of years at this point in our history, and to think that dyslexia came about in the modern age (and therefore represents a relatively new type of disorder) shows a gross misunderstanding of how dyslexia works and is also just an all-around stupid complaint to level against the show. I get that it feels out of place and somehow modern to you, but if you're going to level asinine complaints against anything (in this instance, a television show) then try to at least know something about what you're talking about.

Tywin has brilliant son, but isn't Jaime. (and also think is a very good setup for everything that happens after blackwater.I believe Ros is a very elegant plot device.... she will take the form of every salient whore in the novels. I'll bet that she will be in the brothel where the BwB take Arya and Gendry, (or maybe she'll be in Braavos when Sam kicks Dareon) and will be one of the whores from mole town in the wall, throwing arrows at the wildlings with Jon and Satin when Stannis arrive... the same way they put her in Alayaya place this season.And I like Robb's storyline.I think somewhat the changes are made to give something new to the readers, within the scope of the story. something to look forward to the next episode.

D&D love Martin and wanted to entrust him with a very important episode which happened to be Blackwater, not because he writes teleplays with lots of action scenes (pretty sure that's not something he's known for at all).Actually David says that no one writes those scenes better than George.  George created the world that weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve lived in for the past six and a half years, so the word â<U+0080><U+009C>contributionâ<U+0080><U+009D> doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t encompass the scale of what heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s provided for the series. We were at the Paint Hall with him during season one, showing him one of the sets, and he said, â<U+0080><U+009C>So this is where theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll shoot the scene from my episode?â<U+0080><U+009D> And we looked at each other and one of us said, â<U+0080><U+009C>George, theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re all your episodes.â<U+0080><U+009D> The characters sprang from his brain, so did all the major storylines, so did all the prominent characters. We wanted to give him â<U+0080><U+009C>Blackwaterâ<U+0080><U+009D> to write because no one writes better large-scale battles than George. Ultimately we had to sacrifice some of that scale. There are some wonderful moments from the script (and book) that we wish we could have afforded. But when youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re delivering ten hours of epic fantasy in less time than a studio feature delivers two hours, it just isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t possible to shoot everything you want. It always comes back to horses or Stonehenge.And it was never my intent to say that they showed the battle only because of Martin - simply that Martin pushed the boundaries of what they did show.  If anyone else wrote it it probably would have focused a lot more on what happened inside with Sansa and Cersei and that we can't say that 'regardless of who wrote the episode' we'd see the greatness of what we saw, because that just isn't a guaranteed fact.

2130	ServantOnIce	2012-05-28	How do you know 99% of the population of Westeros couldn't read or write? Westeros is based on Medieval Western Europe, particularly the British Isles and except for Nobility and Clergy no one would read or write. There was no mass public education and no push for learning letters in the home. So the statistics he quoted are accurate. I have heard that around only 3% of people could read or write. That is why folks like Shae and Bronn should not be able to read or write.Also, there was no social advancement, folks lived and died in their same social classes they were born in. Maybe you could luck out and become clergy and learn how to read or write . . but that was about it and even that was a long shot.Stop thinking modern . . think primitive this was primitive warfare in a primitive culture . . . folks had no idea of the scientific method or research . .

Also, since Westeros has only one wide-spread language in use, and the fact that religion plays a large role in the day-to-day life of the people would lead to that conclusion. Regardless, none of this has any bearing on the fact that dyslexia exists because people are capable of reading and writing. The idea that dyslexia is strictly a modern-day disorder has no scientific basis, and doesn't make sense as a complaint against the writing on the show.
2132	zmflavius	2012-05-28	While I liked this episode the most, personally, I don't hold much against the staff writers; there was, yes, a deal which could have been done better, and some episodes I didn't especially like, but none of them were especially "tear out my eyes and ears bad."
2133	Reposado	2012-05-28	They aren't some idiots sitting in a room waiting for Martin to tell them how to stage a TV show.maybe they should be, after seeing this episode penned my martin. the other writes can create some good scenes, but generally the episodes they produce are poorly structured and paced.

So the logical assumption for a student that had dislexia, was that they were just plain dumb and any effort to teach them their letterings would be stopped for more productive ends.  The knowledge that a child was seeing letters reversed or mixed up would not be assimmilated by the teachers.  Combine that with the relative rarity of the disease, simply makes this scenario-a child with dislexia being high born enough to be taught and the symptoms recognized instead of ignored, a solution found and the disease overcome, somewhat ridiculous for the setting.Sorry if you dont see it that way
2135	The Other Knight	2012-05-28	maybe they should be, after seeing this episode penned my martin. the other writes can create some good scenes, but generally the episodes they produce are poorly structured and paced.How many are allowed to stay in one location for 55 mins?
2136	Versiroth	2012-05-29	George Martim should write all the episodesI think the other writers are doing just fine.   Sure, I'd LOVE to have Martin write them all, but I'd much rather him get out books 6 and 7 before I turn 40 (I'm 32...).    With what he's done in the past, that likely wont happen even if he sticks to writing the books only.  If he jumped into the show, we may not ever get the proper conclusion.
2137	Strider	2012-05-29	It was a great episode and GRRM deserves all the applause and praise he is receiving.  I'm not sure if this is my favorite episode of the two seasons, but it's certainly in the top three or four.
It should also be noted that this may have been the easiest episode yet to write.  The story and action is concentrated around King's Landing.  In the previous episodes the writers were faced with the challenge of multiple story lines, jumping back and forth between Bran in Winterfell, Cercei, Joffrey, Sansa, and Tyrion in King's Landing; Robb and Catelyn and the Northern army; Renly, Loras, and Margaery; Stannis, Davos, and Meilisandre; Theon in Pike and later Winterfell, Jon beyond the Wall, etc., etc.  It's very hard to pull all of this together into a unified whole in 60 minutes, which is one reason why so many of this season's episodes have not felt as compelling as last season's.   If faced with the task of writing all the episodes, could GRRM have done a better job than the other writers?  I don't know.  
In any case, kudos to Martin for a brilliant episode.
2138	Lord Manwoody	2012-05-29	This isn't close to the truth... Characters were drastically changed from the books1. Stannis would have never charged the wall himself. He led from the back of the battle2. Bronn and Sandor would never have gotten in a who's dick is bigger contest right before a battle3. Shae would have never gone out of her way to help Sansa... or anyone but herself for that matter.and most importantly,4. Cersei would have never... never... never considered poisoning Tommen.What happened here is that GRRM adapted all of these things so that we could get similar emotional responses as we had when reading the books. This is the exact same thing that has gone on all season.I am not saying that all of the changes this year were as good as this, Mr. Martin obviously knows just what emotional response he wants from his series and was able to adapt these things better than anyone else.Unfortunately, we don't get unlimited time and money in bringing the series to the screen.  Changes are necessary.  I think they've done an excellent job overall.I'm not going to debate about who understands and writes the characters better.  I'll just say that it should be George R.R. Martin, since they are his characters that he invented.I cannot imagine how challenging it is to bring this series to life with finite time and money, and that challenge will only grow as the story expands.  I have a hard time keeping track of everything and I've read the books multiple times.I thought Stannis being the first man up the ladder was totally unrealistic.  Yet, I liked it.  This is television and fantasy...it doesn't have to be realistic for me to enjoy.  I like a little unbelievable on occasion.I also thought the Bronn vs. Hound scene came from out of nowhere.  But again, I loved that one.  I thought the whole scene did a fantastic job of capturing Bronn's character.  As one of the better minor characters in the series, I like it.

2139	Reposado	2012-05-29	How many are allowed to stay in one location for 55 mins?that helps, but i've seen plenty of great episodes of shows that do not stay one place.this episode showed what you can do with this source material. they need to figure out how to give every episode a sense of purpose a focus. too many have been just checking on all the character(sorta like seasons 2-4 of heroes)i'm not saying what they've done hasn't been very good, and one of the best 6-7 dramas on tv right now. but it could be great,and though they were all roughly in the same place, this episode had to juggle story lines for sansa, tyrion, cersei, davos, etcwas it somewhat easier to write this episode, possibly. but the degree to which it blew the rest of the episodes away.....they could also juggle what scenes go in what episodes to make it less "little bit of everyone"
2140	Lord of Cheese	2012-05-29	I wish they had a few more episodes than just the 10. This could have adjusted the pacing and given us more character development. I doubt it would have cost them that much more in budget to have a few more episodes.
With the books, everyone talks about the characters. Thats what has substance. They dont need to have a lot of special effects on tv, just preserving the wonderful dialogue would have made the series. Saving the budget for the blackwater would have been enough.
2141	Reposado	2012-05-29	I wish they had a few more episodes than just the 10. This could have adjusted the pacing and given us more character development. I doubt it would have cost them that much more in budget to have a few more episodes.yeah, it really does. each additional episode costs another 5-10 million. and it doesn't bring in any more revenue. the extra two episodes don't sell more blu rays or add subscribers.the only thing they can do, is spread the book out over more seasons
2142	Ser Tom Tarly	2012-05-29	My favourite episode of the series thus far, very well written. I especially enjoyed the scene with Sandor and Bronn, it had me thinking what if. If I wasnt a reader I would have thought it was all going to kick off there and then. The " Fuck the king" line was great, the look on Joffreys face, nobody else would have got away with that, he would have set the Hound on them /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />
2143	protar	2012-05-30	Far and away the best episode of the season, nay the series. I'm sorry but Martin just blows the other writers away. That is how you adapt ASOIAF. You'll notice that there were actually a lot of book deviations but virtually all of them had a justification, and stayed true to the spirit of the novels. The only scene that fell a bit flat for me was Bronn vs. Hound. Wish we could have Martin writing all the episodes, or more realistically (though probably still very unlikely.), I wish they drew up a new deal so Martin gets more control over the show, like veto power over some of the changes. Season 2 could've ran a lot smoother with such a deal.
2144	SerMixalot	2012-05-30	For me the negative changes have had nothing to do with budget or the number of episodes.  For me it has been changes to basic characterization, things like Jon needing a father figure or Robb hooking up with Talisa cause his mother showed him  noone else is completely honorable, etc.  These changes dramatically change the book characters and I can see no reason for those changes.  We need to see how they will resolve the Robb/Talisa relationship, but I just cant see how they can do it realistically.
They could have changed a little of the dialogue, kept the same story arcs and made the characters closer to the book, i.e. Jon Snow.  THis seems to arise from a basic misconception of Jon's character.
They developed this Arya-Tywin arc that albeit was well acted, went nowhere and left out important character development.  Ok I agree that it would have taken more sets, more characters to develop Arya properly here, but still something could have been done
The Dany arc has been rather a bore for me.  Her arc has been relatively pointless and could easily have been done closer to the book with the same amount of time/budget.  Ok it wouldnt have had the "cool" dragon theft story, but that story is leaving me with a full case of "meh" Does anyone really think she wont get her dragons back?  And so many of her scenes have just seemed repeptitive
I think the KL arcs were for the most part decent, though they probably could have deleted the Joffrey tortures prostitute scene and added a scene or two on either establishing a clearer link between tyrion and Ros or shown some of the darker sides of Tyrion (killing Simon SIlvertongue for example), though again for the most part KL worked though they could have lessened some of the changes to Cersei
2145	_Oberyn_	2012-06-02	Apparently Martin had nothin to with the "Stannis on the wall business", Neil Marshall said in an interview that Stannis was supposed to be at the boats shouting orders but he decided to make things more interesting.
2146	Boz Skagos	2012-06-03	This was hands-down my favorite episode of the season, and possibly of the series.
2147	GoodGuyA	2012-06-03	I hate how people are so ingrained in their minds of what was in the source material that they cannot imagine it possibly happening any  other way. The reasons are basically being invented in order to stick to the purism. Here's a fact: Stannis fought at the battle at The Wall. I don't understand why it was so incredibly important that for the Blackwater he couldn't fight at all. I honestly never saw Stannis as a great man of action myself, but what in his character suggests that if he had a different mindset he would have never gone to fight himself?
This happens repeatedly throughout the series where interpretations of things in the books must be wrong because they aren't what happened. What's wrong with Littlefinger going to Storm's End early? It makes so much sense, when you think about it. How would Catelyn have heard about Renly's forces and King's Landing not until after all was said and done? Infinite complexities are plot devices all the same, and tighter scripts makes for easier viewing. A few people need to take a step back from their "high and might literary podium" and actually examine how things work in context of the TV series, then judge thematic elements.
2148	ServantOnIce	2012-06-09	A few people need to take a step back from their "high and might literary podium" and actually examine how things work in context of the TV series, then judge thematic elements.As soon as The TV Show Can Do No Wrongers step down from theirs . . . . .  some things worked well this season, some things didn't.
2149	A Bong of Ice and Fire	2012-06-09	The other episode writers do try, and I try to be not too hard on them when they fail, as I am just grateful and thrilled that we have this show to enjoy at all.
But this episode showed why this is GRRM's story, not theirs. Lots of details were changed from the books, but it didn't matter. Because George IS these characters, and he made us feel and understand them in ways that the other writers are simply not capable of doing, no matter how they try. 
Season 2 overall was much weaker than season 1, lacking a strong linking narrative and a great central character and actor, whereas season 1 gave us Ned/Sean Bean vs the Lannisters to hold it all together. Season 2 was more flailing and "all over the place", illustrating why we all thought this series was really ultimately unfilmable.
But GRRM is on a different plane as a writer, and this is his baby.
This episode will live forever (at least in my heart) as the greatest, most well-written, visceral, emotional, and REAL cinematic experience ever. 
GRRM won't live forever, but the fruits of his genius will.  And Blackwater will be remembered as one of the tastiest of those fruits.

2150	effervesce	2012-06-09	the facts are that westeros is based on a middle aged society where the vast majority could not read or write (well over 95%-so my 99% is only a slight exaggeration) and well before the advent of the the age of reason and the birth of the scientific method.  So the logical assumption for a student that had dislexia, was that they were just plain dumb and any effort to teach them their letterings would be stopped for more productive ends.  The knowledge that a child was seeing letters reversed or mixed up would not be assimmilated by the teachers.  Combine that with the relative rarity of the disease, simply makes this scenario-a child with dislexia being high born enough to be taught and the symptoms recognized instead of ignored, a solution found and the disease overcome, somewhat ridiculous for the setting.I think you need to watch the scene again. Tywin explicitly says that the maester thought Jaime's reading education was hopeless - basically the response you say people should have had. Tywin took it upon himself to do everything in his power to change the situation, because he's obsessed with his family's legacy and the thought of having an heir who couldn't read would be terrifying to him. It makes perfect sense.
2151	Yvonesan	2012-06-17	I'm not saying D&D are bad writers, just not as good as Bryan Cogman and GRRM. And it shows. The first season is better because D&D stuck closer to the source material of the books. When they did not do so (i.e. Ros), the result was almost invariably inferior.Agreed. I try to keep an open mind on it but this season doesn't compare to last season in terms of quality and I found myself getting distracted while watching most of it. The Blackwater ep was different and glued me to my seat again ...it's difficult not to attribute that to GRRM. In fairness, he does stand the best chance of getting it right since he wrote the story in the first place.Overall, I think it's been more difficult this season to stay invested in the characters to the same degree and I think that's partly due to the sheer number of new characters added in an already pressurized season (in terms of time) and partly due to how the limited time has been used for the characters we got to know and love in S1. It's easy to get annoyed with the likes of Ros and Talisa because their time on screen seems so cheap and pointless (although I suspect that Talisa may have a purpose not yet revealed), taking away so much precious time that could otherwise be spent on scenes/characters that are more important to the story. Anyways, of interest to me - my non-reader friends had no idea who wrote this episode when they watched and all of them said it was far superior to the rest of the season. George's scriptwriting has to be at least somewhat responsible for it. This is what I was thinking. If it was not known that GRRM wrote the episode, I predict a lot of readers would be furious about the lack of the chain, the lack of the song and kiss, and the downplaying of Renly's ghost.The lack of a kiss? Sansa has influenced you too much if it's in your head too! /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />Re the changes made to the episode (or any episode for that matter), I think they're only to be expected on screen ...what matters is how well the change is carried out, how good the storytelling is. If it makes sense, then it works. If it's a detail that seemed relevant in the books and isn't shown on screen, I can accept it if we can still take away the message that seems most important to take away from the particular scene. This episode is the one that I'll remember most from S2 but it saddens me that it stood over the rest so much when compared to it, there were so many S1 episodes of pure brilliance. Maybe I'm expecting too much and when it comes down to it, it's still good TV but I do think something has been lost this season, disappointing when the original story is so good.
2152	ServantOnIce	2012-06-19	After 8 viewings . . still amazing . .

2154	Dawn Age	2012-06-25	I think they had to show how bold Stannis is, being the first on the beach, over the wall and had to be dragged away from the battle by his own men. He wasn't everyone's favorite in Clash of Kings but he won many readers over later on in the books. They have to establish now instead of having us wait several seasons. It worked too, the guy has a huge following now. We didn't like him at first and now we are rooting for him.
2155	thetoddsays	2012-06-01	I know ser Davos survives the battle of blackwater bay in the books, but his ship was off to the side of the fleet, and he could tell something wasn't right. In the show, his ship was right in the middle of the wildfire explosion. How can he still be alive on the show? Thoughts anyone? Has the fire God claimed him?
2156	White Harbors Wrath	2012-06-02	He was clearly shown being blown of the side of the ship towards the water. We know from 100 years of cinema explosions hardly kill anyone...I'm not even entertaining the idea he might be dead...there's no way they cast that guy for 4 episodes of one season.
2157	TheCube	2012-06-02	He was clearly shown being blown of the side of the ship towards the water. We know from 100 years of cinema explosions hardly kill anyone...I'm not even entertaining the idea he might be dead...there's no way they cast that guy for 4 episodes of one season.Yep, this ^Even if you haven't read the books, being blown "to safety" like that screams that we're not done with him yet.
2158	ServantOnIce	2012-06-02	They've killed off so many folks alive in the books, I am wondering if Tyrion is alive!!!  Dinklage may be tired of playing Tyrion and want to move on to other projects  but they could always cast someone else in his role, "the show must go on."
But I don't know, I thought so but when that sucker went up the way it turned that portion of the fleet to ashes, it would take a supernatural MIRACLE for Stannis to be alive  but hey ain't this a FANTASY series???? /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />
2159	scurvy	2012-06-02	Don't you know, he'll wash up on some rock an episode or two into next season and one of Sallador's ships will find him.
2160	Mediumjon Umber	2012-06-02	When I read CoK I was positive Davos was a goner.
/Sarcasm: The scene in Blackwater however... Pffff. The wildfire hardly touched him! I bet Davos didn't even lose one hair of his eyebrows.
2161	Sr.DavosSeaworth	2012-06-04	I'm fine guys, thanks for the concern. I can't imagine for a second that they would kill the onion knight. Who would argue to keep Edric Storm alive? We know there will be Dragonstone scenes from the casting of Selyse and Shireen.
2162	Tourniquet	2012-06-05	Everyone that I watched the show with who hasn't read the book is under the impression that he is dead.
2163	Matthew Marzolf	2012-06-08	I was sure he was dead when I read the book.
2164	Ser Dermett Corbray	2012-06-12	I got the vibe he was drowning in the books but then I kinda knew he'd live because I'd picked up a later book to "have a look" in a shop and noticed his name as a POV chapter heading. D'oh!
I guess he could swim underneath the wildfire as his explanation for surviving. Would be a nice addition to the TV show if he suffered severe burns though. Not the Hound level of burns but perhaps an arm or his neck.
2165	Feather Crystal	2012-05-28	I think the best performance of the night was Lena Headey's Cersei. I'm a Stannis lover too, but I thought GRRM provided some real "meat" for Lena to flesh out for the viewers what the book readers already know and understand: that the book Cersei is a stronger female character than how she has been portrayed on the show. What were some of your favorite lines that she had tonight?
I had to add this edit: I spelled her last name wrong. I believe it's actually, "Headey". I don't know how to edit the subject line to correct the spelling there. Sorry about that.

2166	The Last Reyne	2012-05-28	I have to agree. Her scenes with Sansa were brilliant as she seems to get drunker and drunker but her scene with Tommen (who gives a wonderfully understated performance) was outstanding. We really got to see all facets of Cercei in this episode. Lena Headey was absolutely brilliant her best work imo of the series.
2167	Sheep the Evicted	2012-05-28	I said last week that Headey is a truly fantastic actress. She is a terrible Cerscei (i suspect it's more her fault then the writers), and like everyone else i hated her portrayal at first but once i got over the changes i just have to admit she is incredibly entertaining to watch. I actually think i liked her scenes more then i liked the battle.
2168	zuziako	2012-05-28	I loved the throne scene with Tommen! Although as far as lines go, my favorite was:Sansa: You were Roberts Queen.Cersei: And you will be Joffreys...Enjoy!It was delivered perfectly!
2169	imbs	2012-05-28	drunkenness + recklessness + obnoxiousness = stronger character? i really don't think so. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' /> But totally agree on the performance part; she was amazing idd.

2170	Chalkius Stark	2012-05-28	She was great this episode, she had some real good lines to help her though. All that stuff with Sansa, especially the quip Zuziako quoted, was brilliant.
2171	Crown	2012-05-28	The Throne scene with Tommen was beautiful, even though I knew what was going to happen, I was still afraid she would poison Tommen and herself. Very strong scene.

2172	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-28	Definitely agree. She had me at "shut up, you little fool."
2173	The Meeraculous Third Reed	2012-05-28	Great acting. Best actor/tress this season IMO, alongside Williams and Allen.
2174	Howdyphillip	2012-05-28	I actually felt a little sorry for Maisie Williams because it seems to me that Lena Headey might have just wrestled an Emmy away from an 11 year old girl....
Now that I think about it, it is a rather Cersei thing to do. It may be fitting.

2175	Little Miss Sunshine	2012-05-28	Lena stole the show. She was perfect! That's the only word I can say right now - PERFECT!
Between her and Michelle Farley and Maisie, at least one of them has to be nominated...
2176	Winterfellian	2012-05-28	Hers was definitely some of the best acting in all the season. I loved, loved her scene with Tommen at the throne. She completely sold me that scene despite having read the books and knowing they were safe.
2177	Darth Pipes	2012-05-28	Her performance was fantastic.  It was great all year but it really came together tonight.  GRRM kept most of Cersei's funny dialogue during his scenes with Sansa and then wrote that killer scene at the end, all of which Headley sold.  I really hope she gets an Emmy nomination this season.
2178	Greywolf2375	2012-05-28	yep, could not agree more.  How she subtlely changed through the episode as she got more drunk and more bad reports came in was perfect.  How she became more vicious to Sansa and those in the room was just about perfect
2179	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-28	She was hot as hell in that pseudo-Lannister armour dress, too. /happy.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='^_^' />
2180	Lady Octarina	2012-05-28	I didn't like her Cersei during season 1, but she's simply brilliant in Season 2! Honestly, if they did a whole episode of drunken Cersei I'd never complain!
And I think she managed to pass quite appropriately Cersei's attempt at strength at the same time as despair for her life and her sons'.
2181	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-28	I absolutely loved her scenes, yes. Lena Headey is doing a terrific job here. The last scene with Tommen really was beautiful and I pitied her that moment. Which was gone after a second, but that doesn't matter.
2182	ServantOnIce	2012-05-28	Hers was definitely some of the best acting in all the season. I loved, loved her scene with Tommen at the throne. She completely sold me that scene despite having read the books and knowing they were safe.Her telling Tommen one day he would be king seemed like she knew in her heart that Joffrey is too wicked to last . . . or she was afraid they had lost . . but regardless  . .  /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />
2183	Darth Pipes	2012-05-28	The little moment at the end, after Tywin says that they've won, is a great moment too where an overjoyed Cersei hugs Tommen.  Very human moment for her.
I'm happy now that Lena Headley is going to have some scenes with Charles Dance.
2184	Bronn Stone	2012-05-28	I thought Lena and Sophie owned the episode.  Pretty impressive in that the rest was great as well.
2185	Mooncat	2012-05-28	I can't wait to see Tywin, Cersei, Tyrion, and Joffrey all in one place. The Lannisters really made this episode (plus the battle, of course).
2186	Tewks44	2012-05-28	Cersei did fantastic, I'm really rooting for her to get an emmy this time around.  She's a fantastic actress, and she really shone in this episode.
2187	Bronn Stone	2012-05-28	I think the best performance of the night was Lena Headley's Cersei. I'm a Stannis lover too, but I thought GRRM provided some real "meat" for Lena to flesh out for the viewers what the book readers already know and understand: that the book Cersei is a stronger female character than how she has been portrayed on the show. What were some of your favorite lines that she had tonight?But apparently not so brilliant that she has earned the right to have her name spelled properly.Her last name is "Headey".  No L.
2188	Morvran	2012-05-28	I guess I'm the first to disagree here.  I think she's done a bang up great job this season, but last night I found myself getting annoyed during a couple of her scenes.  I think it had something to do with her 'drunken' delivery.  I'll have to watch it again to get a better grasp on why it annoyed me, but it did.  (I think I was also annoyed that she pulled Shae into a conversation b/c Cersei would never do that, but that doesn't speak to her acting so it's a moot point).
2189	Lord Godric	2012-05-28	Lena Headey was great in this episode -- but she had great material to act as Martin knows Cersei much better than David and Dan do.  Martin brought out book!Cersei and I was glad to see it.  Lena Headey played her perfectly and I just hope we'll see more of her like that.
2190	moonrise	2012-05-28	Lena was great, and to some extent, I think Sansa is being less dull. As in the books, the world around her is shaping her as a stronger girl... at least when compared to season 1.
2191	Feather Crystal	2012-05-28	drunkenness + recklessness + obnoxiousness = stronger character? i really don't think so. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' /> But totally agree on the performance part; she was amazing idd.Perhaps "stronger" wasn't the best choice of word, but I was referring to some of the changes that the show has done versus how it was done in the books. For example, the killing of Robert's bastards was Cersei's work in the books, but in the tv version, it's Joffrey.But apparently not so brilliant that she has earned the right to have her name spelled properly.Her last name is "Headey".  No L.I realized my mistake immediately after starting this thread, but was unable to correct it last night as it didn't post right away. I had to wait until this morning to find my thread and it had two pages of comments before I could make any changes. I don't think I can edit the subject heading, but I will try.
2192	teemo	2012-05-28	But apparently not so brilliant that she has earned the right to have her name spelled properly. Her last name is "Headey". No L.Erm that's a little intense.  Sometimes people just make mistakes.Lena is awesome, and I am really glad that more of Cersei's evilness has come out.  Even though I haven't always thought of her as the perfect Cersei, she is starting to fit more and more.  I think Lena understands her.  I did think she was acting really drunk though last night but didn't look it.
2193	Mulled Wino	2012-05-28	She was hot as hell in that pseudo-Lannister armour dress, too. /happy.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='^_^' />YEEEEEEsSSSSssSSSSSAss!Headey is smoking and her Cersei this episode was absolutely tittilating.

2194	Chelly	2012-05-28	Lena was spot on this episode. I agree with mostly everybody here, she deserves some recognition. I actually prefer Lena's portrayal of Cersei than Cersei in the books. Her scene with Tommen actually made me tear. That was one of the best moments of the episode for me.
2195	Mulled Wino	2012-05-28	She was hot as hell in that pseudo-Lannister armour dress, too. /happy.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='^_^' />My god, she is sooooooooooooooo hot.

Martin brought out book!Cersei and I was glad to see it.  Lena Headey played her perfectly and I just hope we'll see more of her like that.Lets not get ahead of ourselves. The reason most of us didn't like Cerscei in the first season is because she is nothing like book Cersei. In the books Cersei was all wild fire (what was it that Kevan said ?) and raw emotion, like a female version of Jaime and i think Headey is incapable of playing her like that so she turned her into a bitter and sarcastic Ice Queen in stead. Alot of fun to watch, but not the Cersei we know.
2197	mcb	2012-05-28	I actually felt a little sorry for Maisie Williams because it seems to me that Lena Headey might have just wrestled an Emmy away from an 11 year old girl....According to IMDB, Maisie Williams is fifteen. Just nitpicking.
2198	SerMixalot	2012-05-28	My god, she is sooooooooooooooo hot.makes you wonder what they are going to do with her walk of shame scene!
2199	Howdyphillip	2012-05-28	According to IMDB, Maisie Williams is fifteen. Just nitpicking.Yes, I know this... I was just trying to give dramatic effect and use the character's age...One other point is that there was no one submitted for a lead acting role from this series. I think that Dinkledge might have beaten the stranglehold that Bryan Cranston has on that one this year and the show could have won four this year. One for Peter as best actor in a drama, one for Alfe Allen as best supporting, one for Lena Headey. as best actress, and Maisie for best supporting.As it stands, I think that Peter has his already wrapped, and Lena will be a strong favorite.

2200	teemo	2012-05-28	makes you wonder what they are going to do with her walk of shame scene!She has a no nudity clause, so probably just weird angling or a body double....
2201	Prince of Dragonstone	2012-05-28	Her scenes in "Blackwater" make me really excited, considering what's in store for the upcoming season(s). Let's just hope stays on air long enough to see the insanity that was Cersei in AFFC.
2202	All-for-Joffrey	2012-05-28	Honestly, if they did a whole episode of drunken Cersei I'd never complain!You'll get a whole season of it when they film A Feast for Crows. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />

2206	mcb	2012-05-28	She has a no nudity clause, so probably just weird angling or a body double....Now that's just plain mean. She's done nudity before, after all.
2207	kephv	2012-05-28	im sorry but Arya hasnt done anything this season emmy worthyI disagree. Practically every scene she's been in she's nailed. Definitely Emmy worthy.
2208	nara	2012-05-28	She has a no nudity clause, so probably just weird angling or a body double....Out of curiosity, how do you know that?Surprises me a little because hasn't she done it before (in 300)?  In any case, I don't think you need to see her fully naked to get the point across.
2209	TheSwordOfTheEvening	2012-05-28	Loved the scene on the throne, though the ending itself with tywin/loras storming in was a bit to abrupt for me.
2210	David Selig	2012-05-28	Lean Headey has been so much better this season than the last (during which she was mediocre with an exception of one or two quality scenes), it's really quite a turnaround IMO.
2211	Bronn Stone	2012-05-28	You can change a subject line by editing the first post using the Full Editor option.  I am pretty sure that is still enabled.
2212	Envie	2012-05-29	I know a lot of people don't really care for the show's portrayal of Cersei but please don't blame it on Lena Headey ... she is a fantastic actor, really. If you don't like the personality then blame the writers as that's how they've chosen to portray Cersei for this series. Personally I really like her as a more 'ice queen' sort of character - it gives more realistic life to a Queen who has both succeeded and failed in many ways. She's true to the Lannister arrogance and pride.
I'll also agree that Cersei's scenes this episode were truly amazing. I loved her drunken taunting of Sansa and how much she despised the 'hens' in the room, which I remember being one of the key points during the same scenes of the book... how much she despised their frailty and weakness and she was forced to do her 'duty' as queen in supporting them while they cowered - but instead got completely drunk and obnoxious haha.
I also loved how after explaining to Sansa what would really happen if the walls were breached and the men reached them - Sansa quickly started gulping down her wine. Hah...priceless.
2213	Hyper	2012-05-29	Lena Headey was fantastic as Cersei - I have always been a big fan of her in the role.
But then again I have always liked the more 'rounded' Cersei of the show compared to the more 'eeeevil' Cersei of books 1-3.
					
					
							Edited by Hyper, 29 May 2012 - 12:12 AM.
2214	Envie	2012-05-29	I agree with you - having her show a 'weaker' or 'softer' side, even affectionate works for the series where a lot of what she did or how she behaved in the books would not have tranlated to screen in a way viewers could identify with and even admire/hate etc.  I think she's more well rounded as well.
2215	RoamingRonin	2012-05-29	Loved Lena's performance. Can't wait to see her and Tywin sparring next season.Out of curiosity, how do you know that?Surprises me a little because hasn't she done it before (in 300)?  In any case, I don't think you need to see her fully naked to get the point across.I read the same thing, can't remember where though. She did use a body double for the first episode's sex scene. Perhaps the pay just isn't enough.
2216	WinterWarrior	2012-05-29	I can't stand Lena but I can't figure out if its because I hate Cersei so much or if its her. I do think her acting is better this season (last season all she did was wrinkle her brow and look out) but I still can't stand her. So maybe she is a good actor because she gets such a strong negative reaction from me. Her evil Cersei was well played in the Blackwater episode.
It bothers me that we have more of Cersei coming in future books. When I mentioned Cersei after reading the 5th book my husband who has not read the books said "She is still alive? You have to be kidding me!". Honestly,the character has done enough damage that she should have been killed off by someone by now. Why couldn't Varys take care of her along with her uncle?

2217	Feather Crystal	2012-05-29	Lena was spot on this episode. I agree with mostly everybody here, she deserves some recognition. I actually prefer Lena's portrayal of Cersei than Cersei in the books. Her scene with Tommen actually made me tear. That was one of the best moments of the episode for me.I agree. The Blackwater episode humanized Cersei for me and I started to sympathize with her! LOLLoved the scene on the throne, though the ending itself with tywin/loras storming in was a bit to abrupt for me.It would have been abrupt if you didn't catch that the rider on the white horse coming through the fog/mist was Renly's ghost. Someone posted a screen shot and you have to zoom in really close to see his crown. The tv show has to condense a lot of material, but I much prefer GRRM's adaptation than what has been done with the previous episodes this season.

Honestly,the character has done enough damage that she should have been killed off by someone by now. Why couldn't Varys take care of her along with her uncle?Well thats the point Varys wants her too do as much damage as possible. They have a little dialogue before he kills him in which Varys states that he is undoing so much of the damage that the queen did and that he therefore must die (Or something along those lines atleast, it has been a while).
2219	nara	2012-05-29	Loved Lena's performance. Can't wait to see her and Tywin sparring next season.I read the same thing, can't remember where though. She did use a body double for the first episode's sex scene. Perhaps the pay just isn't enough.I heard about the body double too, but assumed it was because she was pregnant during Season 1 filming.  I'm just surprised that a woman can get a job on an HBO show and not have to take her clothes off.
2220	WinterfellRose	2012-05-29	In the Kingswood, there lived a mother lion with her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods, evil things. Like stags and wolves...he could hear them howling in the night. Little cub was frightened. His mother said: 'You are a lion my son, you mustn't be afraid. For one day, all the beasts will bow to you and you will be king. All the stags will bow, all the wolves will bow, the bears in the north and the foxes of the south. All the birds in the sky and the bees in the sea. They will all come to you little lion...to rest a crown upon your head.'Cub said: 'Will I be strong and fierce like my father?'  'Yes,' said his mother. 'You will be strong and fierce, just like your father.'That will keep you safe my love. I promise you....This gave me chills..... She was brilliant....
2221	WinterWarrior	2012-05-29	Well thats the point Varys wants her too do as much damage as possible. They have a little dialogue before he kills him in which Varys states that he is undoing so much of the damage that the queen did and that he therefore must die (Or something along those lines atleast, it has been a while).You're right, now I remember. I had forgotten that. He wants her to do as much destruction as possible and then (my opinoin) his Blackfyre imposter will be more acceptable when he enters into the Westeros game of thrones - or whatever other reason Varys may want to keep her alive. Thanks for reminding me!
2222	boojam	2012-05-29	She has a no nudity clause, so probably just weird angling or a body double....The actor's contracts are on line?Or is that from an interview?
2223	Greywolf2375	2012-06-01	My wife finally got to watch the episode last night, so I watched again with her.  I didn't catch it the first time, but I love how it seems like Cersei is turning the whole time into Maegors with Sansa into a drinking game.  Like it's a big game of "asshole" or something.
Said something dumb little dove?  Drink.
Said something about the gods?  drink.
Said something?  drink.

2225	evening gale	2012-06-03	I replayed her last scene in Blackwater at least 4 times. I loved the right profile shot of her sitting on the throne, hand clutching her little boy's shoulder. Her smile and the lines on her face lent such sympathy to a character I normally love to hate. It was a beautiful portrayal of a mother reassuring her son in what she thought would be the final moments of their lives. I found myself saying a little prayer for her to prevail. Superb. I cannot wait for tonight!

2227	A Bong of Ice and Fire	2012-06-09	I previously thought Lena Headey was a pretty much a hack actress just capable of giving us a cartoon Cersei with 1 facial expression. 
I was wrong. 
To really shine all she needed was good writing. And here she got, well, the best - GRRM.

I can't quite remember what it was but it was actually kind of funny.  Lancel had a great reaction to to when Tyrion said they would put Joffrey's pinched head on a spike.Tyrion: "I chopped wood once.  Actually, I watched my brother chop wood once."Such a Tyrion Lannister line.
2242	LordBloodraven	2012-05-28	"But...what would you have me do uncle? /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' /> "
"Lead. Why would these men fight if you don't?"
Joff to Lancel: "What did my mother say, did she have urgent business with me?" Scared Joff is funny.
"But you were Robert's queeeeeeeeeeeeen"
"And you will be Joffrey's queen. Enjoy it!"
Edit: I forgot the Hound
Hound: Someone bring me a drink. Fuck, that's water?! Bring me wine
Tyrion: Can I get you some iced milk too with a nice bowl of raspberries too?
Hound: Eat Shit dwarf.
Joffrey: Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight . 
Tyrion: You're kingsguard Clegane. We must beat them back or they're going to take the city. Your king's city
Hound: Fack the kingsguard. Fack the city. Fack the king

If so, D&D could keep him around and give him the tasks that other non-introduced characters have. He has been a great character.
2261	Bran Snow	2012-05-27	I think he will still be around. He has to deny being Tyrion's champion a second time when Tyrion is accused of killing Joffery.
2262	Ser Hippie	2012-05-27	I'm hoping that they keep the same general outline (bribed with knighthood and a marriage) and so we still get his [bastard] son Tyrion, at least.

2265	Triskan	2012-05-27	This is a great question.
My brother was only recently introduced to the books and has read them once, and he already expressed this concern.  
TV Bronn is so perfect, and he and Tyrion play off of one another so well. 
Fare ye well, Bronn.  I wish I could have sung Rains of Castamere with you and the boys one last time.

2268	Dolorous Nick	2012-05-27	Dont think so.a- Bookwise he is in for one more full season at least.b- Martin has said he has a significant part in the upcoming books.c- He is a huge hit with the viewers.In light of all that i think he may get writen in the seasons hes suposet to be absent.They can always expand his role in the third season and assign him dialogue/actions that, originally, were given to characters that were written out of the series (Dagmer absorbing Reek's duties) or just flat out create new stuff for his character (Pyatt Pree).  Likable scoundrels will always have a fanbase.

2269	Lord Elrosir	2012-05-27	I'd wager a fair amount of money that Bronn is not going anywhere.  Much too popular of a character (that doesn't die).

2270	ckal	2012-05-28	TV Bronn is so perfect, and he and Tyrion play off of one another so well.Fare ye well, Bronn.  I wish I could have sung Rains of Castamere with you and the boys one last time.This.I think later in the books he will get his few men and climbing spikes and pregnate that bitch,.And this.
2271	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-05-28	the scenes between him and the hound were epic
2272	Hear Us Roar	2012-05-28	he will be around well in to season 3
2273	Eggplant Wizard	2012-05-28	They played him up so much in the show I think it's safe to expect more of him. Same goes for LF who is absent from the next book or two.
2274	boojam	2012-05-28	b- Martin has said he has a significant part in the upcoming books.He has?Could be, George said he would be putting Osha in the next novels.....For instance D and D seem to have a role for Natalia Tena next year.Makes me wonder about Tom Wlaschiha , book wise , in a way, he vanishes too.
2275	Zappotack	2012-05-28	he will be around well in to season 3Even four I believe. If red wedding is end of Season 3, Purple Wedding half way through season 4, Tyrions trial second last episode ending with the viper. So he could be there in all season 3 and 4.Also I like to believe he and Varys end up having a scheme which gets Aegon on the throne. I don't believe he'll last there but he's come too far just to be killed so simply and undramatically. Just my hopes.

2276	madman2711	2012-05-28	Bronn is living with Tyrion until the PW in his new home after his and Sansa wedding so he can be in S3-4 without any doubts
2277	sumpthy	2012-05-28	Maybe he can actually have interactions with Cersei in season 5/6 rather than just having Cersei hear about his trolling. Like Lollys can bring the baby to court and Bronn can tell Cersei what they want to call it, and have his second duel on-screen.
2278	Faraday	2012-05-28	That could work. I was thinking they might shoehorn him in to someone else's storyline for a bit - sort of have him make up for characters that were cut. I think he'll be around for a good while; he was pretty awesome last night.
2279	GoodGuyA	2012-05-28	They'll give him stuff to do. I wouldn't be surprised if they ditched the whole Lolly plot. Just have him rewarded in some other way. Maybe when Tyrion jumps ship (haha) he could hang with Jamie as an Ilyn Payne substitute.
2280	Wjaykusuma	2012-05-28	Bronn will be a knight!
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
2281	drigoly	2012-05-28	I fear that they will make him a kingsguard to keep him around in season 3
2282	Poe	2012-05-28	They have gone through the trouble of making him a more prominent character. I think its fair to say that we will feature in all the subsequent seasons and I couldn't be happier. He is awesome...!yeah just like Irri.... i'm still sour about that
2283	boojam	2012-05-28	I am guessing this has been brought up before.
Why is Bronn so mysterious about his background... plus he seems to have the skills way above average for a common sellsword.
("O you never heard of him.")
Note also, he is the one who found Shae and she too has never told her back story. She is reticent to tell it, and in this E9 does not get to tell it.
(Actually Bronn does not tell Tryion who he got Shae from.)
I think all the above is true about the books too?
Odd? Bronn and Shae connected in some way?
Maybe not.

Bronn and Shae connected in some way?Maybe not.Could be . . . are Bronn and Shae related? Is Shae his sister?  Bronn's skills so far on TV at least are far beyond D. Naahris and other great sell sword warriors in the books.  Bronn is a "Navy Seal" type of sell sword and his knowledge of things is far above someone baseborn.Is Bronn one of those high born lads looking for adventure that  Yoren talked about to Tyrion last season?  According to the books The Red Viper was that type of person, a high born lad who became a sell sword and practiced magic.
2285	Darth Pipes	2012-05-28	I fear that they will make him a kingsguard to keep him around in season 3Nah, totally not Bronn's character.  I think we'll continue to see him and I imagine the non-readers will be in for quite a disappointment when he doesn't agree to champion Tyrion.  What I always liked about that was it was real.  Bronn likes Tyrion but he only cares about money and won't be deterred.  He's not Han Solo coming back and flying to the rescue.It's possible we'll still see Bronn when Cersei becomes Queen Regent for Tommen.  Maybe he can be the one to tell her that they named the kid Tyrion.
2286	Greywolf2375	2012-05-28	they don't even really have to shoe horn a whole lot - he is commander of the GC as well, so having him around going forward isn't going to be that hard to keep him involved and around the main cast of KL.
2287	Ser Adam	2012-05-28	Just the way he speaks and swaggers, I find it hard to picture being noble. He sounds and acts about as low born as they come!
2288	Lord Leyton	2012-05-28	Or they can just have Bronn following Tyrion across the narrow sea, it would certainly be more entertaining than the turtle trecking and maybe when Tyrion is kidnapped he can tag along with Aegon.
2289	malek	2012-05-28	Dont think so.b- Martin has said he has a significant part in the upcoming books.Wen Martin said this ?! Any quotes perhaps ?Btw. I really don't understand what is the point of his scene with Hound. I loved the scene, but why was it written ?
2290	Ser Giant	2012-05-28	I didnt like that scene, Sandor would have just ripped Bronn's face off if he tried sticking him with that blade.
I'm actually starting to dislike the Bronn character, or maybe I'm just getting sick of how much screen time he has gotten in the last couple episodes.

2293	Ser Giant	2012-05-28	I am definitely in the minority, everyone loves the guy. He has his moments, but is annoying and intrusive in some scenes for me.
2294	Qwop22	2012-05-28	Personally, having just reread SoS, I wouldn't mind them doing the same ending of Bronn as in the books. It's a nice bittersweet goodbye between old friends, and no one dies! Bronn comes into Tyrions cell, they talk, and Bronn having been made a knight and getting married, refuses to be Tyrions champion. That would make a great TV scene. Especially if they keep this dialogue. 
"Bronn hesitated at the door. "What will you do, imp?"
"Kill Gregor myself. Won't that make for a jolly song?"
"I hope I hear them sing it." Bronn grinned one last time, and walked out of the door, the castle, and his life.
2295	NomadicDirewolf	2012-05-28	he's still got a good season or more to go, especially, considering he'll be gone around the time of the purple wedding, cant remenber when exactly  when it was in the books, and then for all we know he'll only take a two year break out from thrones with the aDwD and aFfC seasons, which are probably going to be put together, i think its more than likely bronn will turn up again in tWoW or aDoS, and yh its possible he'll be written into other storylines, but i reckon that'd be more likely when he's still about in KL rather than when he's gone
2296	Mulled Wino	2012-05-28	I didnt even read the op, Just assumed that this is a pro-show-Bronn thread.  I dont see why he wint be around for the next 2 seasons bare minimum.  
That guy has acted his way into my top 6 with arya, varys, joffrey, cersei, theon and now bronn.
2297	Reposado	2012-05-29	what if, they replaced kettleblack's role in ASOS with bronn, leading to the eventual reveal that bronn as been a LF plant the whole time.
it'd be a way to get a lot more mileage out of a good actor
2298	YNGWLF	2012-05-29	My guess is they'll keep him around for the next two seasons just like in the books. But eventually they'll have to cut him out to make room for other characters like Victarion, Euron, Ramsay and his Crew, Edmure and the Blackfish, The Reeds. They can't afford to pay everyone. 
Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if they moved some sort of Tyrion/Bronn farewell scene to this upcoming episode. Bronn telling Tyrion he was knighted and that he's leaving, It would make the audience sympathize even more for Tyrion. I hope they don't, I really do like the way he's portrayed in the show and the guy who plays him, but seems like a possibility. And tho I do like him, it's more important for me to see the Reeds, Victarion, etc...
Also, I wonder if his sigil in the show will be changed to a flaming arrow instead of a flaming chain? small detail, but it interests me.
2299	Harrad	2012-05-29	Martin has said he has a significant part in the upcoming books.If true, this is a good thing. One wonders how much of an interaction there is between the series and the books. Not in the obvious sense that the series follows (more or less) the books, but in the sense that the audience reaction to the characters in the series influences the future books. Bronn written and acted in the series is a signficant enhancement (as Bronn Series would say). The rejoinder to "You fought without honor." "No, but he did," as his opponent flies out of the Aerie, is a classic line that does not appear in the book, for one example. Even if Bronn gets put to pasture as in the book, I expect him to return now to both.
2300	ChristophUL	2012-05-29	Although I do not think it will be shown it will be told that Bronn was knighted.  I also hope they show the conversation with Tyrion before a certain trial.
2301	runeghost	2012-05-29	I'm wondering if Bronn isn't going to get most of the Kettleblacks' plotline.
2302	wolverine	2012-05-30	If I remember correctly he gets married (to Lollys) and vanishes pretty soon. I'm wondering if they'll write him in elsewhere since he's become popular and is recognizable. They have spent alot of time developing him to ride off in the sunset,(null)How much more?  I wouldn't mind if Sandor chops him to bits on  his way out of town.  Sandor kicks major ass.
2303	Reposado	2012-05-30	If I remember correctly he gets married (to Lollys) and vanishes pretty soon. I'm wondering if they'll write him in elsewhere since he's become popular and is recognizable. They have spent alot of time developing him to ride off in the sunset,yeah, he then comes back and has that one conversation where he asks tyrion if he can provide two castles and two lordships, that's why i would not be surprised to see him usurp kettleblacks role as he did bywater's
2304	baxter	2012-05-30	someone has probably said it, but I recall George noting certain characters had done so well on the show that he wanted to feature them more in the books, Osha comes to mind, Bronn as well.  I think D&D have been surprised at how good Jon and Ygritte interact, so I wonder if they write in more dialogue there too.
2305	scurvy	2012-05-30	Even four I believe. If red wedding is end of Season 3, Purple Wedding half way through season 4, Tyrions trial second last episode ending with the viper. So he could be there in all season 3 and 4.And, because AFfC and ADwD will be combined to make the timeline make more sense to the TV viewership and not to write Tyrion out of a full season, they could tell Bronn's story with the Stokeworth family, marrying the lackwit Lollys, raising his bastard Tyrion, killing his goodbrother in single combat, and exacting a confession that Cersei sent Ser Balmon to kill him.  Sure most would be vignettes, but the joust and confession would be outstanding and leave him out there as an enemy of Cersei and Tommen.
2306	FiveByeSeven	2012-05-31	Also, I wonder if his sigil in the show will be changed to a flaming arrow instead of a flaming chain? small detail, but it interests me.I was wondering the same thing. Now I think I know the answer.All season I've been trying to figure out the sigil that appears next to Jerome Flynn's name in the opening credits. Fans have claimed it was a flaming chain, but it looked too different. Now I realize it's a soaring arrow, the same he loosed in "Blackwater" to ignite the wildfire. So there's your answer: Bronn's sigil in the show.

2308	BlackTalon	2012-05-31	youÂ´re right, amazing!
these sigils are nicely done, the sigil of Carolyn Strauss is an ostrich, and Strauss is German for ostrich. I guess she has German ancestors.

2310	Clariana	2012-05-31	I seem to recall a while back a convo where it seemed to be agreed that Bronn looked very much like a black brotherhood deserter, a la Mance Rider, I think that background suits his portrayal in the series very well...
2311	Reposado	2012-05-31	And, because AFfC and ADwD will be combined to make the timeline make more sense to the TV viewership and not to write Tyrion out of a full season, they could tell Bronn's story with the Stokeworth family, marrying the lackwit Lollys, raising his bastard Tyrion, killing his goodbrother in single combat, and exacting a confession that Cersei sent Ser Balmon to kill him.  Sure most would be vignettes, but the joust and confession would be outstanding and leave him out there as an enemy of Cersei and Tommen.doubt this will happen. this means introducing several characters for what would be a very minimal sideplot.and they have enough on their plate as is.
2312	Northern Girl 30	2012-05-31	I am guessing this has been brought up before.Why is Bronn so mysterious about his background... plus he seems to have the skills way above average for a common sellsword.("O you never heard of him.")Note also, he is the one who found Shae and she too has never told her back story.

Not sure how Shae and Bronn could be related though but maybe connected somehow.
2313	K.C.	2012-06-01	Bronn's book storyline is unresolved. When last we heard about him, he was gathering swords while claiming lordship over territory just north of King's Landing. Whoever comes to power is going to have to deal with him eventually.
In the meantime, I recall a shot of a man tearing a girl's dress during the riot scene. I didn't pay close attention (and wasn't on these forums at that point), so I could be mistaken, but I assumed that was meant to be Lollys. They can just have a sentence about marrying Bronn off to some lackwit without developing the Stokeworths in detail.
2314	MadMage	2012-06-01	what if, they replaced kettleblack's role in ASOS with bronn, leading to the eventual reveal that bronn as been a LF plant the whole time.it'd be a way to get a lot more mileage out of a good actorThey wouldn't even need to make Bronn to have been a LF plant the entire time. Just say that LF was able to earn his loyalty while Tyrion was convalescing from the injury sustained in battle. I wouldn't even mind seeing him help LF get Sansa out of the city at the end of the PW.

I wouldn't even mind seeing him help LF get Sansa out of the city at the end of the PW.yeah, I don't think he can have been a plant - the intersection of Bronn & Tyrion was a little too random for LF to have been able to plan that.  It would be plausible if LF did gain Bronn as a resource once they reached KL.  Bronn, in his own words, has been dealing with a better class of people now.

2317	7V3N	2012-06-01	Bronn will definitely be back. Cersei tried to have him killed. Bronn made the man confess the crime and point the finger at Cersei, then killed him and is currently the accepted Lord Protector of Stokeworth. He has only gotten more powerful and could come to play if there is scent of Tyrion's return to Westeros.
2318	Reposado	2012-06-01	yeah, I don't think he can have been a plant - the intersection of Bronn & Tyrion was a little too random for LF to have been able to plan that.  It would be plausible if LF did gain Bronn as a resource once they reached KL.  Bronn, in his own words, has been dealing with a better class of people now.very true. very possible for LF to corrupt Bronn once Tyrion has brought him to KL and could still do all the things that Kettleblack needs to do, other than Sansa recognizing his father
2319	FiveByeSeven	2012-06-02	youÂ´re right, amazing!these sigils are nicely done, the sigil of Carolyn Strauss is an ostrich, and Strauss is German for ostrich. I guess she has German ancestors.My personal favorite sigil in the opening credits belongs to costume designer Michele Clapton. It's a peacock! Which is perfect for her role.
2320	K.C.	2012-06-02	very true. very possible for LF to corrupt Bronn once Tyrion has brought him to KL and could still do all the things that Kettleblack needs to do, other than Sansa recognizing his fatherShe's been fucking Lancel and Bronn of the Blackwater and probably Ser Dontos (since we're folding characters into one another)?But seriously, there is some logic to the Bronn/LF idea. I don't think he can absorb all of the Kettleblack storyline though. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />

2323	I'll pay the iron price	2012-06-04	Bronn is to good a character to simply dissappear into obscurity!
2324	Smooth	2012-06-04	Did anyone else find his response to the question of where he learned the Lannister songs odd? From drunk Lannisters is believable enough, but the way he said it made it seem like a lie. I've always hoped there's more to Bronn than meets the eye, but there's several indications in the last couple of episodes that make it seem like he may just be.
2325	7V3N	2012-06-04	Bronn is the sellsword from the riddle. Except he killed all 3 and looted their corpses.
It is known.
2326	A Bong of Ice and Fire	2012-06-09	Btw. I really don't understand what is the point of his scene with Hound. I loved the scene, but why was it written ?It showed us more who these characters really are. They're KILLERS, as the Hound clearly explains to Sansa later. And killers make the world go round. They're the swordsman standing before the King, the Priest, and the Rich Man from Varys's riddle to Tyrion. And good Lord, when Sandor calmly reacted to Bronn's good-natured (?) provocations with an icy "you think you're a hard man?" line, it was perfect. And Bronn's response, whoa. Great scene by George!
2327	teemo	2012-05-27	I have to DVR and watch later, but I wanted to go ahead and submit this thread.  I genuinely hope this episode is 100% perfect and there is nothing to nitpick at.
Typical rules:
Forum rules - no nitpicking actress' faces, body, physical appearance, etc., or making skeevy remarks regarding sex scenes.  Also, please don't talk about physically harming the writers of the show or wish terrible things upon them.
And for the good of the thread, this is a place where people are free to vent about whatever they want, so no getting angry at someone for being too fanatical or a book purist.  And a lot (most) of the posters on this thread aren't those, they just have issues with parts of the show because we love the books.  Feel free to debate the accuracy of someone's nitpick (for example, responding to - "I am so pissed that they have never shown Beric Dondarrion!!!!")...just be nice /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
Hope it's good.  Family gatherings.  Sigh.
2328	Oberyn King	2012-05-27	I am so pissed that I have to work and will miss the epic Blackwater battle.
2329	Greywolf2375	2012-05-27	One thing....
Davos & Stannis allowing the fleet to get that close to a single ship?
2330	Megaduck	2012-05-27	You shall not nitpick this Episode.
2331	Cressit	2012-05-27	You really should title this micro- or nano- nitpicking because it was pretty major, IMO.
2332	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-05-27	This is the first thread made that isn't a rate the show, discuss the show thread?
DIE IN WILDFIRE PLEBEIAN!!!
THIS WAS THE BEST SHOW EVER!!!
Oh gods... My body... I can't.... I can't hold all these feelings!
2333	Ser Coffee The Bold	2012-05-27	This was obviously the best episode of the series so far. The wildfire explosion sent shivers up my spine. This was probably the most loyal to the book series out of all episodes this season. I'm interested to see what they will do with Tyrion's injury, it looks like he will get to keep his nose and he will simply be left with a gashing scar, but we'll have to see.
2334	Planetary	2012-05-27	I really have no major complaints. No other TV series has done a battle scene this large in scale, and even Rome with its $100 million budget didn't attempt anything like this.
Overall, epic.
The highlight for me was watching the wildfire explosion -- the blooming green fire, the ships splintering, the screams, and the faces of Tyrion, Joffrey and the Hound bathed in green light with shock on their faces as the pyromancer cackled. Absolutely fantastic.
The only things that jumped out at me were, 1) I didn't get the sense that Stannis' military was that massive, and I was confused by Stannis himself not only taking the ladder up, but being the first guy up without any protection. And, 2) the ending felt a little rushed.
I have no qualms with the economical storytelling that put Tywin in Harrenhal for all those episodes, and given that plot deviation it really wasn't surprising that Tywin and Loras appeared together striding into the throne room. I'm sure for TV-only viewers, it makes things a lot more understandable to see those two, and to see the lion banners among the forces that turned the tide.
Lots to get to next episode...I'm looking forward to the House of the Undying.
2335	Bastard Walder	2012-05-27	The Hound didn't make Sansa sing for him.
But I guess that's minor.
2336	Ciglon	2012-05-27	With the way Davos flew 20 yards from the explosion, how the hell are they gonna expect people to believe he survived all that? Was a bit excessive imo.
2337	NedFlanderStark	2012-05-27	What was up with all the female actresses physical appearances in this episode???
2338	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-05-27	Oh yah there was no chain.  Didn't miss it though.
Also, did they rename Podrick Payne to Podrick Drake?
2339	Planetary	2012-05-27	With the way Davos flew 20 yards from the explosion, how the hell are they gonna expect people to believe he survived all that? Was a bit excessive imo.Wondering about that too. I think it's possible they may kill him off, but I hope that's not the case.
2340	congokong	2012-05-27	This episode was fantastic. As a purist, this is the first time I could say that this season. The only real chnages I noticed were with Shae being with Sansa, but that's because of the changes D&D made. GRRM had to work with it. I didn't like how small the room was with Cersei, Sansa, and all the women. I thought it was a giant keep where no one could overhear everything Cersei says.
Oh, and Stannis should wear a helmet.

2341	congokong	2012-05-27	The Hound didn't make Sansa sing for him.But I guess that's minor.Since the show writers took out the conversation where he says he'll have a song from her eventually, I guess it would be awkward to put it in now.
2342	Sand11751	2012-05-27	Wow, I must be the only person who had serious problems with this episode:
The Hound's "resignation" - was Joffrey seriously about to cry or was there some another reason he did not have the other KG's "fire" the Hound rather than let him him resign? This is the same king who set the KG on Boros for daring to be late, drunk and a buffoon at a tournament when the season started, but the guy who deserts AND says fuck the king gets to retire. Ok.  
No-helmet-wearing-Stannis dodges flaming arrows and scales the walls first? He became a BAMF in one episode. Wow.
Cersei actually contemplated an act that would have hurt Tommen, absent making sure Sansa lost her head first. Better yet, Ilyn, despite supposed orders lets the little dove fly back to her room. I give up.

2343	TheTrueMithrandir	2012-05-27	unfortunately there was no clash of ships, but its not really a nitpick just an understanding of the budget restraints,
2344	rmholt	2012-05-27	Not enough helms.  The Hound at least could have worn his without it confusing us.
Dinklage got to keep his nose.  Surely Hair and Makeup could have managed?  Or CGI?  Or he could have taken one for the team.
Sansa not going with Sandor. Sure that might have messed up the plots a little but that would be OK with me.
2345	rmholt	2012-05-27	With the way Davos flew 20 yards from the explosion, how the hell are they gonna expect people to believe he survived all that? Was a bit excessive imo.WHo says he survived?  Although I will be most displeased just for the Manderly negotiations.
2346	Morvran	2012-05-27	I could have done with a nastier wound to Tyrion's face, if just to make non-readers really freak out and think he was dead.
2347	Bride of Winter	2012-05-27	no major nitpicks because this episode was probably the best this season. a few little things though - I was kind of hoping it would show more of the sea-battle. It showed Tyrion's perspective from the land nicely but it completely left out Davos' half. And the sense of doom in his chapters with the ships catching on fire and crashing into each other was just unforgettable. So I'm kind of pissed about that.Also really dumb nitpick but I always really wanted them to finish the Red Wedding with a fade to black and then playing the Rains of Castamere during the credits. I don't really think it fit with the Battle of Blackwater? Like I get that it's a Lannister victory, but they just made it, and were pretty much convinced they were going to die. that's not what the song's about. For gods sake, they played the song during the Red Wedding.Lastly, the ending just felt sort of awkward. I would have rather the door have burst open to Loras (or even Tywin I guess) and Cersei dropping the bottle and that being the end of it.

2348	Ramsay Gimp	2012-05-27	Stannis should have had a cool Baratheon or R'Hllor themed helmet. Other than that great ep
2349	Morvran	2012-05-27	My only nitpick would have been if Shae was able to break into her story that Cersei requested, but thankfully she was cut off.  When she started, "When I was 13..." I groaned and just about punched the couch hehe.  But it didn't happen, so nitpick retracted.
2350	SerMixalot	2012-05-27	the only nitpick is that i makes the rest of the season seem like even less
2351	SerMixalot	2012-05-27	not having lancel, the hound and stannis wear helmets, but that makes sense so we know who they are
Stannis DEFINITELY would have been 1st up the ladder.  he is that macho!
Cersei and Sansa-outstanding
Shae-cant wait for her to die
Varys awesome as always!
2352	Patchface12	2012-05-27	Easily the best episode in the season so far. Maybe Martin, like us, did not like D & D's treatment of the Hound and Cersei.
He made Cersei a bitch with little to no redeeming qualities, and when the Hound called Sansa little bird, I finally felt like he was the book character on screen, not some glorified background character.
The most minor nitpick I can think of is Shae is too likeable. Other than that, awesome, amazing episode.
2353	UnknownSoldier	2012-05-27	My only nitpick would be the scene on the Blackwater. The way it played out with the literal creeping doom as the wildfyre spread to the ships and then as everything got crushed up against the chain was one of my favorite scenes in the series. While the explosion was cool, it just didn't do the scene justice.
2354	Ciglon	2012-05-27	WHo says he survived?  Although I will be most displeased just for the Manderly negotiations.I'm fairly certain he will survive, or else who will set Edric Storm free, and be forgiven for it? Who will be able to convince Stannis to head North? Who will go to get Rickon from Skagos?I don't believe anyone is capable of doing all that except Davos, remember that he is the only voice that speaks truthfully and without abandon to Stannis except Melisandre, since everyone else just repeats her words to him like a parrot. Seeing as it's pretty certain that he will be coming back, I think it would have been better to have him fall when the boat sank/got ripped asunder.I mean, Matthos was blown away by the explosion and it will later be revealed that he died from that. But from what we saw it looked like Davos suffered a blow equal or even worse than his son did, and we expect him to survive? Not entirely far-fetched, admittedly, but a tad bit hard to believe.
2355	Dunnii	2012-05-27	I haven't really posted -- been lurking each week -- but just had to say this was a great episode! Loved the wildfire.
But.. I want to nitpick about Lena Headly. Way too much Cersei tonight. The way she talks drives me nuts. And I hate her character so much; I hate her more than Joffrey, so it was nerve wracking to have to watch her talk so much.
But overall, what a great episode. And I'm glad Tyrion didn't lose his nose. It's TV -- I don't want to look at a man without a nose!!! Voldemort was enough.
2356	SerMixalot	2012-05-27	my biggest complaint is that I wont have anything to complain about this week
2357	K.C.	2012-05-27	Does the existence of Ros in the preview for next week's episode count? I know how much the nitpickers love her.
2358	moonsblood	2012-05-27	Overall it was a great ep, I really wish Georgie could write every one.
Little things:
Lena really over did the drunk acting, I found her to be more comical than anything else.
The Sandor and Sansa scene was a bit weak.
I was sad to see the chain go, but I get it.
2359	Affcwasmyfavorite	2012-05-27	My only nitpick was too much non-essential fluff at the beginning, I spent half the episode looking at the clock on my tv going shit shit shit 10mins left?? How will they, Oh they just shoved it in at the last second ok! XD
2360	Magjee	2012-05-27	Solid episode, I hope non-readers gathered what happened there.
Would have loved to see the all out battle as described in the book, but it would have been impossible with a tv budget /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
2361	Morrigan	2012-05-27	The Hound didn't make Sansa sing for him.But I guess that's minor.Yeah, I thought about that, and figured, maybe it would have looked silly on the screen. I dunno. I liked how Sansa clutched the doll Ned gave her last season. <3Oh, and Stannis should wear a helmet.This! LOL. He charges headfirst without adequate protection. Sheesh, Stannis, learn how to wage a war. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />Also really dumb nitpick but I always really wanted them to finish the Red Wedding with a fade to black and then playing the Rains of Castamere during the credits. I don't really think it fit with the Battle of Blackwater? Like I get that it's a Lannister victory, but they just made it, and were pretty much convinced they were going to die. that's not what the song's about. For gods sake, they played the song during the Red Wedding.Well they have to introduce the song at some point. I thought it was fitting.My own nitpicks, though they are few and pretty much all very minor:- It should be Garlan in the armour, not Loras! (Spoiler alert: I'm kidding, I really don't care)- A real nitpick: I didn't quite get the point of the pissing contest between the Hound and Bronn. What was that scene for? I get that Bronn saved Sandor's ass after and sorta proved Bronn's point to him, but other than that? Felt a bit awkward.- I was hoping the Hound to be a bit more brutal towards Sansa (song or no song). He was too... gentle, haha. - Lancel takes an arrow wound and so he runs to report to the queen? Eh, looked kinda weird, but I guess they preferred to use a familiar face for that. Not sure if that wound would incapacitate Lancel that badly later on.- Speaking of that, Tyrion got to keep his nose. Okay, I understand that (though I'll miss the "handless and noseless, the Lannister boys!" line /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />). But the scar should have been a wee bit more impressive, IMO.- Really tiny nitpick: I wish Stannis wore a helmet. And that the Hound wore his hound helmet.
2362	Tourniquet	2012-05-27	Reverse Nitpick: Tyrion had on the chain of the Hand of the King rather than the Pin?!?!
2363	zippypoodle	2012-05-27	OMG! So many changes from the novels!! Completely ruined!!
Bronn did NOT have a face off with the Hound in the books.
Stannis did not personally charge the wall.
No freakin' chain? NO FREAKIN' WAY!
Cersei did not have a convo with Pycelle.
Tommen was not supposed to be on the throne with Cersei. He was supposed to be hidden away an another fort!
Cersei and Sansa were supposed to be at a feast! Not just in some little room! GRR!!!
2364	Valkyrja	2012-05-27	I agree with some of the nitpicks above, especially about the scale of the battle. I appreciate the budget constraints, but it would have been nice to have just a few more wide-shots of everything.
But most of all, my nitpick, as to be expected, is Hound-related....
No blood-stained white cloak left in Sansa's room! /bawl.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bawl:' />
Unless, of course, she somehow still has the one he gave her earlier in the season, but considering he wore it again afterward (or another one?), I highly doubt it. /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />

2365	Gaius Martell	2012-05-28	I'm not sure how I feel about Tyrion's facial wound.  I don't think chopping his nose off would be good for a TV series, since it's hard for audiences to like an ugly character, and Dinklage looks MUCH better than Tyrion should, as is.  But a light scratch on both cheeks?  That might not even SCAR, which is a problem, methinks.
Oh, and I wish Pod would have had speaking lines.  They seem to have given a bunch of his nervousness to Lancel.  I enjoy him stumbling over what to call people, and I'm afraid we'll miss out on him calling Brienne "Ser" a few seasons down the road.

2366	_Oberyn_	2012-05-28	The Hound slicing people in half was a bit too "Chuck Norris" for my liking /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
2367	Tewks44	2012-05-28	TERRIBLE EPISODE
In the books they were drinking golden vintage from the Arbor, in the show it is CLEARLY Dornish red.... WHAT???? WHAT THE HELL GRRM?
In the books they assemble in the Tourney Grounds, while in the show they are clearly seen landing on the RIVER BANKS!!?!?!?!?!?!11?!?/ UNACCEPTABLE 
In the books the ships were equipped with horns, and in the show they used drums?? ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS
2/10, would not watch
2368	Lord Elrosir	2012-05-28	Try hacking at someone with a heavy, heavy two handed longsword with the strength of a Clegane, and you'll slice people in half.  I thought it was awesome!
2369	towerofjoy	2012-05-28	I love how everyone on the boards has morphed into nagging mommies - "Stannis/Sandor/Bronn/Lancel: wear a damn hat..."
2370	teemo	2012-05-28	Alright, I LOVE this episode like I assume most people do (and this is from a book purist), but there are still a few things:Bronn and Sandor?  Wtf I don't get it?No chain and not enough wildfire overall after the first explosion.  But that was a nifty explosion.Why did Maegor's Holdfast look like a homeless shelter?  And what is Shae doing there and why would Cersei even acknowledge her?Why the hell is Stannis fighting?  It was damn cool though, I'll say that.Shae is always sleeping with Tyrion like it's no big deal.  No secret meetings.  Just meet up anywhere and it's cool.San/San, I'm assuming shippers aren't too happy with that scene.  I don't really care, but it was weird. Also, it made more sense in the books for Sansa rejecting Sandor's offer to leave with her, because Dontos swore to help her and Sandor was freaking her out. The offer doesn't look so bad in the show. I was also looking forward to her song, since I thought it was going to happen because she said in an interview she was nervous about singing in an episode.  Should have known it was a prayer.No Antler Men because they don't want to make Tyrion look bad at all.Didn't Lancel get shot with an arrow on his right side?  Then how was Cersei causing him pain by hitting him on the left?"Fuck them in the asses?"  Really?Sansa talking shit about Joffrey to Shae.Lol I like how Shae thinks she can't get raped because she's carrying a knife with her.  This is the second time we've seen "badass Shae with a knife."People are going to be confused by the Mandon Moore thing.The very last scene with Cersei/Tommen was kind of lame (her storytelling specifically).Deviations I thought were good/didn't mind:The Cersei poisoning Tommen thing seemed kind of unnecessary, but it did hit home the point that no matter how psycho she is, she has always shown love for her children.  However, Tommen shouldn't even be there....but whatever, it would have confused viewers to have a Joffrey/Tommen/Ros threatening contest; two was enough.Loved Bronn singing Rains of Castamere.  And that girl, she's one of the three whores of Westeros, right?The Hound becoming especially infuriated with Joffrey.  Loved the look on Joff's face.The banter with Tyrion/Lancel/Hound/Joffrey was pretty funnyTyrion not losing that much of his face.  Just would have been too difficult to maintain for who knows how many more seasons.  Spend the money on something else.But I would like to say, I am SO SO ecstatic that they made The Rains of Castamere.  Even if he didn't fit in the credits, I just think it's so awesome that they made it and played it twice in the show.  THANK YOUUUUU.10/10 though, despite any deviations.  I wish GRRM could write them all.Oh, and this is the first episode my boyfriend has ever said was "okay."  YES.  Progress.

2371	victim	2012-05-28	I don't think the Knight in Renly's Armour came across very well, I didn't even really notice him until the very final shot when he removed the helm. I hope we hear some talk of that in the next episode; perhaps Stannis' troops talking about Renly's ghost or even Loras saying what he was doing or something will suffice. I guess I just wish we got more of a close-up to see he was clearly a Baratheon killing Baratheon's, at first I thought he was fighting for Stannis. 
Other than that, damn great episode.
2372	House Martell	2012-05-28	I mean, Matthos was blown away by the explosion and it will later be revealed that he died from that. But from what we saw it looked like Davos suffered a blow equal or even worse than his son did, and we expect him to survive? Not entirely far-fetched, admittedly, but a tad bit hard to believe.Matthos was on the back of the boat nearest to the explosion (after the "bomb" ship passed them) and was consumed by flame. Davos was on the far end of the ship and the explosion threw him off away from the fire into the water, which will be what saves him.Yes the "no helms" was a little silly but it's TV, you don't want all your actors running around in helmets with their faces covered.Is "Stannis was too awesome" a nitpick?And my biggest complaint is GRRM just made all the other writers look foolish
2373	Nagisa Furukawa	2012-05-28	The gutting of the Sansa/Sandor scene.
Other than that, no big complaints.
2374	K.C.	2012-05-28	hk47, I was wondering the same thing about Cersei's "homeless shelter"... I think it was supposed to be a bunker. But Cersei questioning Shae made total sense to me, especially if she was drunk.
Also, the choice of singer during the credits made it seem like someone got Game of Thrones and True Blood mixed up.
2375	tolthar	2012-05-28	Just wanted to point out that tyrions wound is exactly what that type of gash would look like after just being cut. Its not till it bleeds and pusses and gets infected and rots that it becomes worse, as it bleeds more it will inflame and get bigger. This is a fresh sword cut to the face. and in the books he only loses the bridge of his nose. Its what Tyrions believes is comical about it when he looks at it in a mirror.lets at least see what it looks like next episode.
2376	The Smiling Eye	2012-05-28	If I had to nitpick, It'd be about Sandor. I get that he's impressively strong and one of the strongest men in Westeros, but him cleaving a man in full plate in two effortlessly is a bit too much I think. That requires superhuman strength, especially with a mere sword.
2377	teemo	2012-05-28	hk47, I was wondering the same thing about Cersei's "homeless shelter"... I think it was supposed to be a bunker. But Cersei questioning Shae made total sense to me, especially if she was drunk.Also, the choice of singer during the credits made it seem like someone got Game of Thrones and True Blood mixed up. /lol.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':lol:' /> yeah, I guess so.  It's hard to say since Cersei wasn't really all that drunk in the books.  She stopped after a couple and was a little loose lipped, but she was really just comical and over the top in the show.
2378	teemo	2012-05-28	I really feel like GRRM was having a lot of fun in this episode...like having Stannis fight and stuff.  Little additions for fun and things we didn't get to see in the books.  I really liked that.  I also liked how he was able to kind of "fix" some of the writers mistakes, or at least work around them really well.  I liked Sandor's attitude, it shows that he's a badass that doesn't care what anyone thinks of him.
2379	rmholt	2012-05-28	Who the heck thought it was OK to let Pycelle's beard grow back normally?
2380	Kushluk of Skagos	2012-05-28	I am a huge sansan fan.... I cried when I read it in the book (no joke), so I missed that.
2381	DurararaFTW	2012-05-28	Who the heck thought it was OK to let Pycelle's beard grow back normally?This, if anything he looks less weak now.
2382	Jolene Brown	2012-05-28	That was absolutely badass, the only teeny tiny quibble is that I think they could have worked in the Renly's ghost thing with a line or two of dialogue and a weird fuzzy vision Stannis had of Renly/Gethin Anthony's face, or maybe by giving someone else the relevant lines of Dontos's dialogue to Sansa.  But the ending was so amazing, and the episode was so great - I hope episode 10 can live up to it! 
it's funny but I always thought it was Loras in Renly's armor in the books anyway - I was really shocked when it turned out that it was Garlan instead.  I must have missed whatever reference made it clear it wasn't Loras when I was reading the book initially.
2383	Brucolac	2012-05-28	Loras tells Jaime about the battle and not being able to fit into Renly's armor.   Garlan is probably not going to be cast anyway, so it makes sense to use Loras instead.  I think that was only in there for book fans, anyone who hasn't read them isn't really going to notice that rider being all that different from the others.
2384	The Knight of Flours	2012-05-28	Surely this should be the shortest nit-picking thread ever?
I guess it might not be and that would really be my only nit-pick about this episode..
2385	Acetabularia	2012-05-28	Wow. I'm impressed! I think they cut budget on the previous 8 episodes just to give this one a boost. There was no song from the little bird, but at least the hound paid Sansa a visit. From the way they were going in the previous episodes I thought they were going to cut that scene completely. I was also afraid Tyrion wouldn't suffer his fatal wound, but they stayed true to the book there too.
Granted I did imagine the battle differently when I read CoK, with the huge chain across the Blackwater and the three whores. But the way they adapted it was impressive. I'm a little disappointed that they didn't give Davos as much screen time, non book readers will probably think he's dead after he got blasted from his ship.
I'm actually looking forward to the season finale now! /wideeyed.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':wideeyed:' />
Just to add some cynicism in here: The reason this episode was so good was probably because it didn't feature the storyline of Robb/Talissa, Jon and Dany.
2386	teemo	2012-05-28	Just to add some cynicism in here: The reason this episode was so good was probably because it didn't feature the storyline of Robb/Talissa, Jon and Dany.Yeah, I've noticed I've found episodes much more enjoyable when Dany and Robb/Talisa aren't in them (I like Jon in the show for the most part).
2387	teemo	2012-05-28	This is the first thread made that isn't a rate the show, discuss the show thread?DIE IN WILDFIRE PLEBEIAN!!!THIS WAS THE BEST SHOW EVER!!!Oh gods... My body... I can't.... I can't hold all these feelings!did you just tell me to die, lol
2388	Sheep the Evicted	2012-05-28	The only major thing i didn't like was the change to the Hound/Sansa scene (nope don't give a shit if GRRM wrote it, it was weak) also how rushed the fight at the end felt. All of a sudden there is guys, then there is more guys, then there is Tywin Lannister saying we won; i get a feeling the Unsullied will think its a dues ex machina and won't like or understand it. This is a minor concern though, its so staggering to see what they DID manage to pull off that all the rest are insignifcant niggles.
2389	teemo	2012-05-28	Would have been awesome if it was a two hour special.  Sooo hard to fit all of that into an hour.  I kept checking the time and thinking, "how are they ever going to finish this?"  I think Mandon Moore, fake Renly, and how the war was actually won is going to really confuse some people as well.
2390	Sheep the Evicted	2012-05-28	Alright, I LOVE this episode like I assume most people do (and this is from a book purist), but there are still a few things:Bronn and Sandor?  Wtf I don't get it?Why did Maegor's Holdfast look like a homeless shelter?  And what is Shae doing there and why would Cersei even acknowledge her?San/San, I'm assuming shippers aren't too happy with that scene.  I don't really care, but it was weird.

This is the second time we've seen "badass Shae with a knife."Dude you're a master. I fucking lol'd about Lancel (which i didn't realise till you mentioned it) and of all the things you listed the others are the only things that made it onto my niggledar.
2391	Valkyrja	2012-05-28	The only major thing i didn't like was the change to the Hound/Sansa scene (nope don't give a shit if GRRM wrote it, it was weak) also how rushed the fight at the end felt.

This is a minor concern though, its so staggering to see what they DID manage to pull off that all the rest are insignifcant niggles.Obviously, I am not GRRM so I can't say for sure why he did what he did, but it seems to me he was doing the best he could the with Sandor/Sansa scene given how much of their interaction in general had been omitted by the show during the previous episodes. He seems to have put as much in as possible while still keeping the 'continuity' of the show-'verse. Sandor never even asked Sansa for a song during the show, so her singing for him would have had zero meaning for non-book reading audience and may have even seemed weirdly out of place in that moment.That said, I am a huge fan of Sansa and Sandor, so I totally agree and wish GRRM would have just said a great big F*** YOU to the previous episodes and written it in anyway. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
2392	madman2711	2012-05-28	my nitpick is that it was too short screen time, i mean it was closing to end time and Tyrion was still inside the walls, the ending was a bit rushed with the Ty/Ty (Tyrell/Tywin) cavalry incoming
i would have asked HBO to cancel all other Tv Series for this one 
and please D&D when GRRM is writing take notes as to how is it done
cersei was brilliantly bitchey as she should have been all this season
2393	NedFlanderStark	2012-05-28	My only complaint is that they didn't make Stannis badass enough
2394	Sharpes	2012-05-28	Nitpick: I was looking forward to the fade-to-black-followed-by-loud-noises scene and it didn't happen! /ohmy.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':o' /> </sarcasm>
Couldn't see if there was a Tyrell flag in the host attacking at the end.
Sadly, it still doesn't make up for 8 eps of disjointed editing and nonsensical scenes. >/sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
2395	The Knight of Flours	2012-05-28	Didn't Lancel get shot with an arrow on his right side?  Then how was Cersei causing him pain by hitting him on the left?I just watched it again and it looked like she hit him on the same side he took the arrow.
2396	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	'We outnumber them 5 to 1' - it was actually more like 2,3 to 1 odds, make it 2 to 1 or 3 to 1 if you want 'cos obviously 2,3 doesn't sound well, but please, not 5...
2397	Dracarya	2012-05-28	I have such tiny nitpicks that they're barely even worth mentioning, the episode was that good. Slightly disappointed that:
- There was no chain
- Sansa didn't sing for the Hound, and that scene was pretty short
- Small scratch on Tyrion's face, but I understand why he didn't lose his nose.
As for just the viewers, they might be confused as to why Tyrion was attacked. But I hope that gets cleared up next week for them.
2398	DurararaFTW	2012-05-28	'We outnumber them 5 to 1' - it was actually more like 2,3 to 1 odds, make it 2 to 1 or 3 to 1 if you want 'cos obviously 2,3 doesn't sound well, but please, not 5...?? With the Stormlands bannermen along with the Dragon stone bannermen, Stannis had something approaching 30,000 men at his side. King's landing had, what? 5000 at best? A 5 to 1 estimate was fair.
2399	Gogossos	2012-05-28	The build up was brilliant in portraying that uneasiness just before battle but it took too long. Which isn't bad in itself but it made the ending seem too rushed. Between Tyrion saying "oh fuck me" when he was being overrun by Stannis' men and Tywin bursting into the throne room with a "we won" is about 4 minutes. Too short a time to let the tide turn one way and then the other way.
2400	The Meeraculous Third Reed	2012-05-28	My gripes are minor, and they mainly revolve around the failure to distinguish Sansa as a worshipper of the Old Gods. The different religions are important, and the failure to acknowledge that is a continuing theme and subsequent failure (see Karstark's referral to The Father last week).
2401	Ran	2012-05-28	Sansa is a worshipper of the Seven and the Old Gods alike... and actully tends to the Faith more, really.
2402	kkae	2012-05-28	Stannis charging alone without helmet and shield felt wrong. Sure it was cool but didn't feel right.
2403	The Greenseer	2012-05-28	Best show of the series, and straight up bad ass!
If I am to nitpick it would be:
 no chain,
and to the non-reader it prbly was not clear that the Hound was deserting because of fear of fire.
Aldo didn't a lot of KL's surrounding areas burn as well?
2404	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	?? With the Stormlands bannermen along with the Dragon stone bannermen, Stannis had something approaching 30,000 men at his side. King's landing had, what? 5000 at best? A 5 to 1 estimate was fair.On first readthrough I was under the impression he had a mighty host as well, but it wasn't the case. At its peak his army wasn't even half as big as Tywin's army. I missed the fact Stannis had failed to get Renly's entire host (mostly because Renly took only part of his army to Storm's End and the Tyrells stopped him from claiming the remaining bannermen Renly had left behind). In the end he only got a quarter of it and had 20 000 men. The combined force of the defenders was 6800 (Tyrion had been enlarging the city watch and hiring mercenaries), which isn't that hopeless since a siege means the defenders have a large advantage. It was only later I realized (also by looking at the Wiki) that Stannis was actually very badly outnumbered when the 80 000 Lannister / Tyrell men arrived, so I was hoping they'd make this clear in the show as well. 3-1 (the actual odds at the start now that I look back on it) is doable for a defending force in a siege, 5-1 becomes kinda iffy. And then there's of course the Hillmen who dealt damage to Stannis' force before he reached King's Landing. You can check out the Wiki for further clarification: http://awoiaf.wester..._the_Blackwater

You can check out the Wiki for further clarification: http://awoiaf.wester..._the_BlackwaterAh right, in the book Renly had split off his cavalry and infantry, his infantry being stuck a few days back while his cavalry had no supplies so had to engage Stannis, then Renly died and the cavalry flocked to Stannis while Loras fled back to the infantry and kep them on stand by.In the show Renly isn't half the idiot he is the books, and no such distinction was made. It was just the Tyrells that fled. But even so, Matthos still doesn't understand siegecraft for sh*t I agree.
2406	birdsong66	2012-05-28	My only nit-pit is that THIS episode makes all the rest look like hack work.  With very few changes, which didn't really disrupt the continuity as such IMO, stands as evidence that one can adapt a book or scene for a television audience without completely fucking it up, dumbing it down, or otherwise spoon feeding it as a shadow of the original.  Thank you GRRM.About halfway through, Mr. Birdsong66, with a look of surprise on his face, said, "Who wrote this?  It's good."YAHTZEE!!
2407	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	In the show Renly isn't half the idiot he is the books, and no such distinction was made. It was just the Tyrells that fled. But even so, Matthos still doesn't understand siegecraft for sh*t I agree.Here's to hoping it'll be explained in the next episode 'cos for a non-reader Tywin and mostly Loras' presence must've been rather sudden and random, but it was a good catch. Maybe Mathos just isn't that strong at maths... (c what I did there?)
2408	Morvran	2012-05-28	The two non-readers I watched with BOTH didn't realize Tyrion had been struck down by one of his own men!  Whether just because the Kingsguard don't stand out enough, or b/c of the way the battle was shot, or b/c they decided not to cast Mandon Moore's character...they didn't catch it.  It should have been clearer.  He should have been fighting side by side with Moore and then Moore turns on him.
2409	Arkash	2012-05-28	Because I dont recall the show ever really mention enough the Kingsguard, there like a bunch of normal guys in the show, one of the really few things I have to reproach the show.
2410	Ser Greenbark	2012-05-28	Tyrion's speech- it was primarily all about protecting your city.  But looking at who he was speaking to it was all Lannister troops- presumably from the West?  Not a major thing, I just thought the speech would have been better if it was more explicitly Lannister vs Baratheon or something like that.  Defending the city doesn't make sense if they are not from the city.
2411	Gran de Lys	2012-05-28	Tewks44, you made me spit coffee out my nose. I hereby rescind previous bitching about the lack of chain. For the most part, the episode did everything right--righter than I could have dreamed. Aside from nitpicks about Stannis not wearing a helmet/applying sunscreen/moisturizing around the eyes, I think a couple of key points were rushed, as other posters have said. It's important that non-book viewers know that Tyrion was struck down by one of his own, and that was a bit of a mess, and the Ghost o' Renly thing seemed hazy and confusing even to me, and I was looking for it. Also, "We won" sounded a little like an answer to, "Were you able to find a parking space?" GRRM's usually subtlety was lost with that line; a smirk would have done it.
On the other hand, "Rains of Castamere" was handled nicely. The significance of the ballads is going to move into play next season and this was a great set-up. Not bothered by Tyrion's hanging on to his nose. I never thought that would be feasible on TV anyway.
2412	bikie	2012-05-28	the only nitpick is that i makes the rest of the season seem like even lesshaha, that's my nitpick as well... watching this and thinking it would be worth it to wait 5 years between season if GRRM could write them all...
2413	Lady Octarina	2012-05-28	I missed Renly's Ghost, and the Hound's anger and panic when he leaves the battle. But the episode was so perfect I had to try really hard to notice anything that bothered me. /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />
2414	StannisWins	2012-05-28	But the episode was so perfect I had to try really hard to notice anything that bothered me. /bowdown.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bowdown:' />I hope this isn't a "repercussion", but this attitude fascinates me. Why would you even want to try to notice something that bothers you? It seems like so many people here watch the episodes with the specific intent of find things that they don't like just so they can complain about them.It's just weird to me that people go into this with the attitude of "ok, what won't I like tonight?".
2415	Targaryen Kaiser	2012-05-28	Not a really nitpick but I would like to see Highgarden's flag along the Lannister's one, when the cavalry saved the city. Not that it really matters anyway. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
2416	Greywolf2375	2012-05-28	I hope this isn't a "repercussion", but this attitude fascinates me. Why would you even want to try to notice something that bothers you? It seems like so many people here watch the episodes with the specific intent of find things that they don't like just so they can complain about them.It's just weird to me that people go into this with the attitude of "ok, what won't I like tonight?".That's not really what that means I believe.  It's just an ironic statement - "I had to TRY to find something I didn't like"
2417	Arkash	2012-05-28	As for the sigils, I agree: they showed Renly's one: the golden stag on green, but yeah, I would have loved to see the golden ROSE on green.
2418	Valkyrja	2012-05-28	Not enough heraldry/banners/flags in general in the series, imo!
Sounds stupid, but this fact honestly disappoints me. /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />
2419	SerMixalot	2012-05-28	Try hacking at someone with a heavy, heavy two handed longsword with the strength of a Clegane, and you'll slice people in half.  I thought it was awesome!i would love to, but I am only  missing the heavy two handed longswordand the strength for that matter /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />
2420	Qwop22	2012-05-28	One thing that sort of killed the battle for me was the fact that Stannis was the first one to charge off the little skiff right into the wall of archers, WITH NO HELMET ON. First off, why would the King be on the front lines missing armor, charging straight into a wall of fire arrows. Secondly, he just climbed his way right up that ladder into defenders without getting hurt? That whole scene of that small group of men standing at the wall with Stannis and then climbing up the wall seemed a little cheesy to me. I would think they would all have gotten slaughtered either in the charge to the gate, or definitely climbing the ladder lol. But it's a TV show and I know it has constraints. The episode was still awesome.
2421	SerMixalot	2012-05-28	i got the impression that that bronn-sandor scene was something GRRM wanted to put in his books
2422	ShadowRaven	2012-05-28	I liked this episode very much. The best of the season I guess.
Just:
- Battle went to fast. It didn't seem like they outnumbered CR 5/1......
- Where's Tyrion's ring?
- Where was the North?
- Bran?
Oh and:
- Phuck you Tywin
- Phuck you Lannisters!
I really HATE High Garden now. Really, bastards.
2423	FierceElite	2012-05-28	Can't get past this leader-Davos. So horribly out of character. Or his dickckhead, religious zealot, of a son.
Shae is just nothing short of terrible, in every way. Such a waste of screen time, with every scene she's in.
First I was confused why Cersei needed poison with Ilyn Payne around. Then I just facepalmed at the prospect of Cersei poisoning Tommen.
While I totally approve of The Rains of Castamere, that whole Bronn vs Hound scene was so entirely pointless. The Hound isn't one to engage in a pissing contest.
Tyrion and Varys scene was okay, I guess.
That Sansa and Joffrey scene was just...awful. Nothing takes me out of the show more than a character doing something horribly out of character.
I appreciated the Cersei/Sansa scenes nearly straight out of the book, but I'm getting really fed up with Lena's monotone Cersei. She's more boring than detestable. The dialogue that wasn't out of the book...dumb. "You were Robert's queen." "And you will be Joffrey's, enjoy." It was funny and all, but come on. Cersei hates on her son way too much in the show. He's supposed to be her gold medal. He can do little to no wrong, in her eyes.
Sigh...I just don't understand why we couldn't have the chain. It really emphasized Tyrion's genius. I can't see how it would have cost more to do the chain and launching pots of wildfire than a massive wildfire explosion. This feels like one of those stupid times where they just thought they could do something more "exciting" than the book and exercised their creative license. Hate it.
I mostly enjoyed the battle beyond that, except I wasn't a fan of Stannis pulling the old one man army cliche. He's not renowned for being a warrior like Robert. He's a commander.
Emphasizing the Hound's fear of fire was done well enough.
Joffrey being a little bitch was amusing. "What did my mother say, exactly? Did she have urgent business with me?"
Tyrion rallying the troops was okay, though I don't think that's exactly how the dialogue went.
Sansa singing was just...ugh. It's nice the Hound and Sansa got their scene and all, except the guy that plays The Hound doesn't get the character at all, and the dialogue was almost completely different.
That was such an awful way to course correct with Ser Mandon. Really? He's just going to attack the Hand for all the world to see? I expected it, but it's still lame that they watered down Tyrion's injury. Pod didn't waste any time owning him though, lol.
Cersei and Tommen scene sucked. It annoyed me a lot that they made the Lannister flag so obvious. It would have been a lot more interesting if you weren't sure who it was that was showing up all of a sudden. Would have been nice to pay homage to the book fans by showing someone leading the charge in Renly's armor...Looks like people in this thread are saying Loras was wearing Renly's armor, but I couldn't tell. Looked bland.
...and Tywin being all bloodied up. He's an old man and there's never been mention of him having any particular military prowess beyond his brain. Hard for me to swallow the notion that he was in the middle of the combat.
More Rains of Castamere at the end was awesome.
2424	runeghost	2012-05-28	I'll join with the helmet nitpickers. It's really a very minor point, and I know that the reason for the lack of helms is so that we can actually see the faces of the truly talented cast, but I still winced a little every time I saw experienced warriors and/or important notables running around a battle full of rocks and flaming arrows without any sort of helm. At least Tyrion had one on for his big charge, and it actually made sense that he had it off when he got hit.
In any case, it was a brilliant, absolutely amazing episode!

2425	SerMixalot	2012-05-28	the sansa joffrey scene was from the book
2426	teemo	2012-05-28	If the chief nitpick of the show is no helmets I think that means the episode was awesome.

2429	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	If they had helmets the same people would probably be going 'Who was that?!' 'I could hardly make anything out!' 'Was that Stannis who cleaved a guy's head off?' /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />

I get that this fandom can be unnerving trying to find flaws in every single scene of every single episode, but I meant exactly this:That's not really what that means I believe.  It's just an ironic statement - "I had to TRY to find something I didn't like"
2432	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	'OMG was that Tyrion they cut down?'
2433	Storms End	2012-05-28	This thread shouldn't even exist for this episode.
2434	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	Exactly. GRRM wrote it and he is pretty much the God of his own realm.
2435	SerMixalot	2012-05-28	in the scene with tyrion/shae/sansa a couple of things seemed off
tyrion refers to shae as sheela (clearly to  hid that he knows her)
and she responds Shae
Not Shae, Milord
then at the end of the scene she says Come My Lady
both of these seem out of context for a lowborn servent to be speaking to a high born even given the special circumstances of shae
of course it could beintentional by GRRM to show Shae is not careful and sansa begins to suspect something is up with Shae
I think HBO is setting us up for Cersei to have a hand in Shae's downfall next season
2436	AdiTarg	2012-05-28	I would like to point out, that I found Bronn's position when shooting the arrow extremely awkward. I thought he should have been in the opposite direction, something was off there. At least in terms of where everyone should have been.
I also thought the end was too short, they should have added another minute or two.
2437	pntrlqst	2012-05-28	Hound/Bronn scene was unnecessary and slowed the pacing of the episode down considerably. Had no place in this episode. Without it this would have been flawlessly written/directed and fluid from beginning to end, but alas ... it had to take a piss break where only a few sprinkles came out.
2438	SerMixalot	2012-05-28	I find it ironic that Cersei is able to immediately see through Shae, due to Shae's inability to do a correct curtsey (and how stupid is Shae to not know how to do a curtsey-she must have seen 10,000 of em), yet so few people actually recognize these westeros courtesies.
Robbs camp could use someone with Cersie's observational skills
2439	moonrise	2012-05-28	Is that a Nalgene bottle Pod gives the Hound when the latter asks for wine instead of water?
2440	Talleyrand	2012-05-28	There was a few minor nitpicks I had but I feel as when compared to the pure enjoyment I had watching this episode it just doesn't feel right to try and criticize it.
2441	teemo	2012-05-28	It's hard to nitpick GRRM's show, but I think it's fair.  It's not like he's the only person involved with the show.  D&D and other people are doing things and approving things and modifying things where necessary, and also a lot of GRRM's scenes probably ended up on the cutting room floor (like all episodes have scenes that end up there).  Plus GRRM has to deal with some stuff he didn't create (Shae with her new attitude for example).  It was so awesome though, I'm still joyous from it /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />

2442	House Martell	2012-05-28	i got the impression that that bronn-sandor scene was something GRRM wanted to put in his booksHound/Bronn scene was unnecessary and slowed the pacing of the episode down considerably. Had no place in this episode. Without it this would have been flawlessly written/directed and fluid from beginning to end, but alas ... it had to take a piss break where only a few sprinkles came out.I get the feeling that GRRM was trying to "fix" what the previous writers had done to the Hound. This episode really tries to drive home the point that he is a badass and more complex than just being Joffreys guard dog. Other than killing Micah way back in the beginning of last season TV hound has been a "pretty nice guy", violent yes but he's usually saving someone (Loras/Sansa), so starting a fight with Bronn (a guy who's on his side) show us that he is kinda a dick and not totally beholden to "vows" or the king.
2443	House Martell	2012-05-28	The two non-readers I watched with BOTH didn't realize Tyrion had been struck down by one of his own men!  Whether just because the Kingsguard don't stand out enough, or b/c of the way the battle was shot, or b/c they decided not to cast Mandon Moore's character...they didn't catch it.  It should have been clearer.  He should have been fighting side by side with Moore and then Moore turns on him.I've never liked the Kingsguard look in the show. I always thought they were supposed to be all in white and really stood out. Their armor in the show doesn't look terribly different from anyone else's...
2444	LordofWinter	2012-05-28	i loved this episode. in line with the topic of this thread i decided to compose a pros and cons list. cons:no chain- i knew it wouldn't happen, the scene didn't really suffer without it, but again i really missed it. cersei plans either to sympathy kill tommen or a double suicide- either way completely out of character for that bonkers blonde. lancel-just in general, i don't like the character. they did a decent job in regards to how things played out with him. i guess one arrow in the ribs sufficed. ser dontos- okay, i'm pretty sure he was in the room with Cersei, Sansa and the women dressed in motley juggling, so can we please introduce his side story with                                                    sansa already.im pretty sure davos is dead. at least it looks impossible for him to be alive. he was right in the thick of that blast and flew 30 yards. i wouldn't have minded if they had toned that down just a bit. the hound- liked him, just thought he didn't look distraught enough. seemed more tired than scared for his life. and did he just say fuck the king in front of all of the kings men without anything happening to him? joff homeboy you are slippin' and finally........LORAS FUCKING TYRELL!?? seriously? you couldn't cast a Garlan? fantastic, now i'm going to have to read fanboys talk about how Loras was probably the better fighter and option. the purpose of Garlan Tyrell is to demonstrate the difference between real knights(Garlan, Beric, Barriston) and "the knights of Summer" (Loras, Lancel). you didn't even need to pay him much. just two episodes and never see him again. i understand budget and all of that shite but for christs sake!!!!!NOT ENOUGH VARYS!!! I CAN'T SAY THIS ENOUGH. pros:sandor vs bronn- who else actually wants to see this fight now? drunk Cersei- played the scenes beautifully, even had that twisted look in her eyes the whole time. Stannis B- "hundreds will die my lord" "thousands." / "come with me and take this city". BAMF status-approved. plus who wouldn't fight for a "king" who's the first man off the boat and takes on 3 men at a time?varys talking about the bells always ringing for horror. funerals, sieges and weddings.....joff-who is this actor? cause i'm pretty sure i feel so bad for him that he's going to be seen as Joffrey Baratheon for the rest of his life, and for that people will want to spit on him. but holy fuck does he do a spot on job. tyrion- not only did i almost tear up after his speech, i ran out into the street and killed two of stannis' men myself while yelling "HALFMAN, HALFMAN, HALFMAN!!!!" did i mention bronn? cause i can't remember a time when he was on screen that i didn't enjoy it. he gets more badass with each growing second. wildfyre- great!!! would have like to have see them use it more, but i guess that also falls into a budgetary thing. THE REINS!!!!!!-thought it was a nice addition to have bronn singing it with lannister men, but the way they played it at the end was beyond perfect. bronn quote of the week - "i saw you kill a man with nothing but a shield, you'll be unstoppable with an axe." thank you GRRM
2445	unRobert	2012-05-28	my nitpick: Should have been 2 hours.
2446	teemo	2012-05-28	my nitpick: Should have been 2 hours.Yesssss.  It would have ran a lot more smoothly.
2447	protar	2012-05-28	That. Was. Awesome
I mean yeah, would've liked the chain and more navel stuff but they are on a budget and Ran has said that they at least tried to make the chain so it's no biggy. The only thing that kind of fell flat was the Bronn/Hound scene: No build up and no pay off, it felt out of place and kind of felt likeit was just there to fill up the nudity quota.
But otherwise everything was great.
2448	Don't_call_me_Ser	2012-05-28	OMG! So many changes from the novels!! Completely ruined!!Bronn did NOT have a face off with the Hound in the books.Stannis did not personally charge the wall.No freakin' chain? NO FREAKIN' WAY!Cersei did not have a convo with Pycelle.Tommen was not supposed to be on the throne with Cersei. He was supposed to be hidden away an another fort!Cersei and Sansa were supposed to be at a feast! Not just in some little room! GRR!!!But you do get that the TV show is not the same beast as the books? It's similar, we'll get to the same destination, but the path will be rather different at times. If the changes are upsetting you this much you'll probably explode by season 5 or so?!
2449	The Meeraculous Third Reed	2012-05-28	Sansa is a worshipper of the Seven and the Old Gods alike... and actully tends to the Faith more, really.Yes, but a nod to the Old Gods from time to time would be worthwhile, considering that she's going to be spending an awful long time in the Godswood during season 3 (even if her reasons are less than pious, she still needs the Old Gods as a justification to do that).
2450	Don't_call_me_Ser	2012-05-28	..... Ignore, double post. Can we not delete them? I can't see how?

2451	Talleyrand	2012-05-28	One thing keeps on niggling at me. Loras was wearing Renly's armour so they stuck with that part, would it have been two hard to simply have maybe just a few people shout "Renly!" or "Its Renly.". Maybe they'll have someone explain it to Tyrion when he wakes up.
2452	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-28	I expect explanations in the next episode as well because there was hardly any time for that now and it must have all seemed very random (on purpose) for non-readers.
2453	Sorlain	2012-05-28	This may or may not have been mentioned before, but I'm still a bit annoyed that the show kind of forgot about Lightbringer. Stannis' just swinging a regular sword around. Unsurprisingly that about sums up my problems with the episode.
2454	Mad Queen	2012-05-28	I could have lived without that Bronn/Hound scene. It didn't really add anything to the story. More Hound is always a good thing, but I'd rather get a longer scene with Sansa.
2455	Natmus	2012-05-28	The biggest, most glaring, error in continuity is the one that has been building a few weeks: Tywin Lannister kicking his heels at Harrenhal until the second half of the eigth episode of the season, and then suddenly appearing outside Kings Landing a two days later (show-time), having linked up with the Tyrell forces on the way. Not the fault of this episode as such, but bad coordination by the story supervisor.I'm utterly amazed that the attack on Tyrion did take place in full view of hundreds of witnesses. Having Pod taking out the Kingsguard (Was it Mandon Moore? No names were named or faces seen.) in front of all the other soldiers must raise some questions for later.Stannis never thought of entering King Landing through the man-sized sevage drains, which only are held locked by a little chain. Stannis didn't even think of guarding them, so they couldn't be used as sally ports.Sandor Clegane was denied his catch-phrase word "bugger" and used "f*ck" repeatedly instead. Why?Putting Loras in Renly's armour made little sense in the context of the show, and I doubt if any non-reader notices, and even if they do, they hardly understand. In the books, Renly's very distinctive armour first gave grounds to believe that it was Renly himself that had arrived to defeat Stannis, as seen in Sansa's chapter where Ser Dontos tells her that Renly has saved the city. Later this all gives rise to the Renly's Ghost myth, but the best part of the books was just there where Dontos tell Sansa that Renly has come to save the city, and you as reader wonder how that can be, as you as reader clearly saw Renly killed. That little masterpiece of writing in the books couldn't be translated into the show, so I wonder why they bothered with Renly's armour on Loras at all, since it's so meaningless in the context of the show.

2458	House Snow	2012-05-28	I honestly don't see what was so different about this episode from some of the other ones people were complaining about.  Most of the things people whined about were still present in this episode.  Multiple added scenes, some of which were mostly character building, change in a cannon scene with no song from Sansa, a couple of major changes in the battle, a couple of character x (mainly Stannis) would never do that moments, etc.  Kind of feel like that the biggest difference is that GRRM wrote the episode so the changes went from stupid to awesome, when really they were always pretty awesome.
2459	gelerth	2012-05-28	Anyone can tell me how Bronn teleported to the other side of the BW ? He borrowed magic portal from LF ? Same question goes to Tywin's army...

Couldn't agree less.
2461	Dirty Steve	2012-05-28	Wow, I must be the only person who had serious problems with this episode:The Hound's "resignation" - was Joffrey seriously about to cry or was there some another reason he did not have the other KG's "fire" the Hound rather than let him him resign? This is the same king who set the KG on Boros for daring to be late, drunk and a buffoon at a tournament when the season started, but the guy who deserts AND says fuck the king gets to retire. Ok.  No-helmet-wearing-Stannis dodges flaming arrows and scales the walls first? He became a BAMF in one episode. Wow.Cersei actually contemplated an act that would have hurt Tommen, absent making sure Sansa lost her head first. Better yet, Ilyn, despite supposed orders lets the little dove fly back to her room. I give up. It was Ser Dontos who was Drunk not Boros. If your going to Nano nitpick then come correct
2462	Dirty Steve	2012-05-28	Anyone can tell me how Bronn teleported to the other side of the BW ? He borrowed magic portal from LF ? Same question goes to Tywin's army... There were 50 miles of tunnels built by the Targs. Some were made for escape. The same tunnels that lead Tyrion out of the black cells at the ens of ASOS
2463	Bronn Stone	2012-05-28	Putting Loras in Renly's armour made little sense in the context of the show, and I doubt if any non-reader notices, and even if they do, they hardly understand. In the books, Renly's very distinctive armour first gave grounds to believe that it was Renly himself that had arrived to defeat Stannis, as seen in Sansa's chapter where Ser Dontos tells her that Renly has saved the city.

That little masterpiece of writing in the books couldn't be translated into the show, so I wonder why they bothered with Renly's armour on Loras at all, since it's so meaningless in the context of the show.This is more in the TBD department, IMO.  A comment in a subsequent episode that the knights rode through the back lines of Stannis' troops because they appeared to be lead by Renly could make all the difference.  That comment may never come, but it still could and it would make sense.  We don't have to actually see every detail for it to have happened - being told later is good enough and essential for certain budgetary issues.If there was anything that characterized the Blackwater episode in my book was that it was jam-packed.  They couldn't spare forty seconds for Varys to actually explain why he hates sorcery.   I would guess that in GRRM's first draft, he did make that explanation then and there.  There was no time to peek in on any other POV.  And I think it worked pretty well.  So if time was so critical, I can see postponing the explanation of Loras' trick to either the final episode, or early next season (if KL is not really revisited in the finale).
2464	Serr Parker	2012-05-28	I know its without repercussion but if you don't like this your expectations were too high, I would have liked a chain and other little things but Cersie's little story about the Lion in the Kingswood made up for it a great touch
2465	Reposado	2012-05-28	The only thing that kind of fell flat was the Bronn/Hound scene: No build up and no pay off, it felt out of place and kind of felt likeit was just there to fill up the nudity quota.to be fair, that was quality nudity.but the chain would have been really hard to film. i didn't expect to see that.
2466	Harrad	2012-05-28	The "ship" that Stannis rode in on did not heave on the waves. He went up the stairs like it was a two story house.
Cersei called the stags evil, even tho Tommen knows that the stag is his house sigil. A little strange that there werent good stags and bad stags (Stannis).
2467	Jolene Brown	2012-05-28	Putting Loras in Renly's armour made little sense in the context of the show, and I doubt if any non-reader notices, and even if they do, they hardly understand.

I just love that sad little moment when Dontos is like, do you know who led the vanguard, do you?  And Sansa answers, "Robb?" all hopefully, even though she must know that's ridiculous.  So sad.  Poor thing.
2468	unRobert	2012-05-29	It's awesome that even this thread is mostly full of praise.
My nitpick has been mentioned earlier, as someone stated that it has now been established that Harrenhal is a two day ride from KL. This is not necessarily episode specific, but I don't understand why they did this at all. That one line of dialog could have been changed from 2 days to at least 2 weeks. Now after teleporting LF and Tywin's 2 day march on KL, we're supposed to watch 3 seasons of Brienne, Jamie, Arya and others taking months to not even reach their destinations (all in the riverlands)?
2469	Sand11751	2012-05-29	It was Ser Dontos who was Drunk not Boros. If your going to Nano nitpick then come correctThat's what you come up with - I typed a name wrong? /eek.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':eek:' />
2470	Spidey	2012-05-29	I'm a bit iffed about the Lancelpoking. I liked how in the books he stood up against Cersei and called her on her bullshit. He actually earned some respect from me by that.
Here, she just pokes him and he doesn't get to finish. /sad.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':(' />
2471	KC_Accidental	2012-05-29	Cersei continuously mockingly repeating everything Sansa said like a little child. Sounded like she got acting lessons from Ygritte. 
Stannis without helm or shield first off the boat and first up the wall! Why he was even up there I do not know. 
Looked like 20 men were attacking the mud gate.
Shae.
2472	Reposado	2012-05-29	tough to find anything to pick at here. the only thing i would have liked to see that would have been reasonable (because things like the bridge of burning boats is not really filmable) was the lack of catapults. while the boats are ferrying men in to the shore, they should have some catapults throwing stuff at them.
2473	Leto Atreides	2012-05-29	My biggest nitpick would be that it never looked like Stannis's army had a chance to take the city. Even before Tywin's cavalry charge, they were just a couple of guys running by the wall. They should have added at least one shot that establish how huge Stannis army is.
2474	Marjie Eilie Myatt	2012-05-29	The two non-readers I watched with BOTH didn't realize Tyrion had been struck down by one of his own men!  Whether just because the Kingsguard don't stand out enough, or b/c of the way the battle was shot, or b/c they decided not to cast Mandon Moore's character...they didn't catch it.  It should have been clearer.  He should have been fighting side by side with Moore and then Moore turns on him.I haven't re-watched it, but didn't they use Ser Meryn Trant to do the deed instead?  It looked like the same guy who's been slapping Sansa around.  His lower face in the helm looked like Ser Meryn, who I thought was on the wall with Tyrion earlier and went out with him.Since this thread is for nitpicking without repercussion, let me echo what many have said here and on other threads about the lack of helmets on these key players--including Stannis, who doesn't belong anywhere near this battle but they've got to show him as a fearless commander I suppose.  Of all the things that we make excuses for  --they're on a budget, blah blah blah-- how stupid do they think we are?  And it's obviously not minor; we ALL were thinking it as we were watching.  It was a total distraction.There's lots of ways we could have told them apart.  Make Stannis' fiery heart on his breast plate more prominent/obvious, for example, or give him an antlered helment.  (Show him putting the helmet on as he's about to disembark.)  We saw how Tywin walked into the throne room with a big red sash on.  We know the Hound has the dog-shaped helmet.  And I don't know about you, but I can tell the Kingsguard helmets from the others.If they want to save money for the battle, they could ditch that hovel of a bunker the women were holed up in, and crowd them all into the throne room.  The set already exists and it's not a far cry from the room they were trying to feast in, in the book.  Ditch the breast plate Cersei's wearing.And, where, indeed, is Ser Dontos, as others have asked?  It wasn't worth saving the guy from his fate; non-readers (and we're always making excuses for the non-readers) won't even remember who he is next year.  I couldn't think of a good reason for Sansa to turn Sandor down in his offer of a trip to the North.  But thank goodness he didn't make her sing.
2475	Evamitchelle	2012-05-29	I haven't re-watched it, but didn't they use Ser Meryn Trant to do the deed instead?  It looked like the same guy who's been slapping Sansa around.  His lower face in the helm looked like Ser Meryn, who I thought was on the wall with Tyrion earlier and went out with him.I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be Mandon Moore. He was on the wall with Boros Blount, and Joffrey specifically tells them to stay with Tyrion.
2476	Lady of Long Lake	2012-05-29	I wanted louder drums. These are war drums, for Heaven's sakes. Make the world reverberate with their sound! We want weak knees and wet under clothes so make them FIERCE!
2477	teemo	2012-05-29	I couldn't think of a good reason for Sansa to turn Sandor down in his offer of a trip to the North.  Exactly.  After she had made that deal with Dontos it made plenty of sense to turn it down....but now with no Dontos?  Doesn't really make any.  Why would she want to stay there and marry Joffrey?  And it wasn't like in the books; Sandor wasn't in her bed freaking her out.  He was sitting in a chair and speaking pretty clearly. Big error IMO, Sansa/Dontos storyline should have been introduced earlier and more time made for Sansa in general.  It wasn't until the last couple of episodes until she started getting any real screen-time. That's not a nitpick of this episode, that's just overall for the season.
2478	KC_Accidental	2012-05-30	I think Sansa's reasoning was that Stannis was going to take the city and she thought she'd be ok if he did. That's my only guess. To be honest I was confused as to why she never went with him in the book. Sandor or Dontos? Which will keep her safe the most? Hmmmm.
2479	SerMixalot	2012-05-30	seeing where the Hound ended up it looks like Sansa made the right choice! /drunk.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':drunk:' />
2480	StarkWard	2012-05-31	For the lack of anything bad to say, just this... It would have been better if they included Mel's whispered warning to Matthos (Death by fire is the purest death.) on the previously on section. That way, people will really think Mel is prophetic. Maybe they didn't put it because it was too much of a giveaway.
2481	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-31	Since this thread is for nitpicking without repercussion, let me echo what many have said here and on other threads about the lack of helmets on these key players--including Stannis, who doesn't belong anywhere near this battle but they've got to show him as a fearless commander I suppose.I can't repeat it enough, but Stannis did fight on the Blackwater in the books, just off screen. He said "Lightbringer didn't serve me better than any other sword on the Blackwater." How would he know if he hadn't used it? He just didn't fight on the walls in the book, but that's because of the geography of the battle changing and minor characters like Guyard Moriggen being cut. Plus GRRM wrote it. He decides what his characters can or can't do.Make Stannis' fiery heart on his breast plate more prominent/obvious, for example, or give him an antlered helment.That's actually more dangerous than what he did now, it's like saying. "HERE I AM. SEE? I'M THE KING. HERE I AM SHOOT ME. AM I PLAIN ENOUGH FOR ALL TO SEE? SHOULD I WEAR AN EVEN BRIGTHER OUTFIT?' Stannis instead blended in with his men, which was the smarter choice. Some enemy soldiers would know his face, but a lot of men wouldn't be able to make him out as the King because they've never seen him up close. He wore no helmet so at least his men would recognize him, and there were plently of soldiers without helmets as well (like the one he kills). A helmet may give some protection but it also severely limits your hearing, vision, and if it's a visored helmet like you suggest, your ability to shout orders, which are all extremely important for a commander. In the book, Stannis wears only a crown in battle.

2482	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-31	They could've made a bigger point of Loras in Renly's armour, like with Stannis muttering "Renly... !?" or something as he turns to regard this mystery horseman carving his men up. Honestly, if I hadn't read the books, I never would have made that correlation.
2483	Slingingstones	2012-05-31	After the initial shock wave followed by the sound wave of the Wild Fire, the expressions on all defenders of King's Landing was truly the: J. Robert Oppenheimer moment, "Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."It visibly shook the Hound.  It certainly was some potent, "pig shit".

2484	Kittykatknits	2012-05-31	Unlike every single other episode this season, I have very little to nitpick.
I thought Cersei's breastplate was rather silly looking. Reminded me of the bra Madonna used to wear.
I wish the scene between Sandor and Sansa had been a bit more clear in explaining why she didn't go with him. Every single person I have spoken to in RL thinks she went with him.
Tywin's line at the end was a bit over much. The "we won" sounded awkward to me. His presence alone was pretty powerful.
2485	Mista C	2012-05-31	Davos, upon seeing the single Lannister ship leaking fluid from the back, procalaims to himself "Wildfire!"  Davos knows what wildfire is?  Tyrion didn't even know what it was until he went and saw it for himself.  And Davos knows what it looks like leaking out of a ship at night in the dark?
2486	Silverx2	2012-05-31	This isnt so much a nitpick of the show as the story overall but:
Once again we get a scene that shows why i hate the character Sansa so much. it seems like she goes out of her way to avoid being saved. In the books we at least get her pov, we know she had a plan to escape. but in the show here comes the hound, Stopped by her room specifically to ask her if she wanted him to take her with him north, and she said no. Okay sure she THINKS stannis is winning but that doesnt change the fact that he drawbridge is up and the castle is full of lannister guards, a wooden door isn't going to stop them from getting in. Her character is just so infuriating, which is also why i like Arya so much. Sansa waits to be rescued and constantly refuses opportunities to help herself escape, Arya sees opportunities and takes them.
My other nitpick would be about the fleet.. no not that they got that close to one ship, but that other nitpickers seem to think that sailing a boat is like driving a car. most of the fleet are mainly sail powered, once in formation breaking apart and scattering becomes extremely hard and potentially dangerous. naval combat is much more different that Arial and ground.
2487	Roboginger	2012-05-31	Just to add some cynicism in here: The reason this episode was so good was probably because it didn't feature the storyline of Robb/Talissa, Jon and Dany. /agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />TERRIBLE EPISODEIn the books they were drinking golden vintage from the Arbor, in the show it is CLEARLY Dornish red....

2488	Elba the Intoner	2012-05-31	I haven't posted on the nitpick thread before mostly because I wanted to see how everything played out first, but now that we are at episode 9, I want to nitpick about something that keeps popping up, not just in this episode but others, that I don't like. 
That is, why do they keep referencing how much Varys "likes" little boys? This is the third time at least that there has been some hint to it and I don't like it. It's not necessary to his character and I thought that in the books he was only using little boys (and girls) as part of his spy network. I guess what bothers me about it is that it's another change to a character that I don't understand, and I think it hurts his character. In the books it is Littlefinger who uses children as sex slaves, giving little boys to Lynn Corbray, and that is one of the reasons why I hate him. Though Varys is no saint, and he does use children for his little birds network, I didn't get the feeling it was for sexual uses which to me is worse. Anyway, that's just my feelings on the matter. I guess it's not really a big deal in how the show is playing out but I don't like it.
2489	Ser Dermett Corbray	2012-06-05	Can someone tell me if they made it apparent how Pycelle was released from the black cells? I assumed it must of been Cersei (wasn't it Tywin in the books?) but I can't remember it being explicitly made apparent by any characters who freed him. Just turns up randomly to give Cersei her bottle of Dreamy Sleepy Nightie Snoozy Snooze then waddled off after spending so long in the cells.
2490	Feron Amathy	2012-06-05	the ending annoyed me. they really messed up the whole renly's ghost thing by being in two minds about how far to push it and ending up doing it half-arsed, meaning it confuses those who haven't read the books and annoys those who have. they take care to focus on a guy being a bamf riding a white horse, but without any dialogue to convey that the horseman's wearing renly's armour it's wasted.
my proposed alternative (because obviously i know better than george and d & d):
episode where cat (and the viewer) are reintroduced to renly: as well as the return of loras and renly and the introduction of margaery you have one more storm lord in the shot (doesn't matter who). said storm lord exchanges 10 seconds worth of dialogue with renly (equivalent to how they introduced karstark with robb).
post shadow-baby: littlefinger and the two tyrells AND said storm lord are in the tent with renly's body. the scene works as they did it except that the storm lord makes no move to leave at the end of the scene. loras' notices and asks him if he's coming. storm lord apologises and says that with renly dead, stannis is the undisputed ruler of the stormlands, and his place is by his side.
later in the episode, 30 second shot of stannis landing on the beach. the storm lord has the remnants of renly's army lined up waiting for him. they all kneel, and stannis and the storm lord's eyes meet, storm lord dips his head and stannis nods, slight smile of satisfaction on his face.
blackwater. storm lord is with stannis when the wildfire goes down (could even make it him who argues with stannis that 'hundreds will die'). storm lord leads the reinforcements who attack tyrion's victorious sortee while stannis is fighting on the wall. tywin and some bamf on a white horse charge in. cut straight from badm to storm lord's stricken face. he whispers 'renly?' under his breath. cut to tyrion about to pass out watching the cavalry pour in, but add shouts of 'Renly' to the sound effects. then cut to stannis seeing his men running and shouting at them to hold. then have him do a whole 'Renly?' under his breadth. then cut back to a close shot of badm's helmet, *with the antlers*, then back to stannis, clearly unable to believe his eyes, being dragged to safety by his men while he's too stunned to resist. then as cersei's finishing her story to tommen, cut to one low shot of the horsemen dismounting, so you see the white horse's legs and a slow-mow of the rider's boots hitting the ground, with twyin's boots (encrusted with lions, so you know it's him) hitting the ground next to him as he too dismounts, then when they enter the throne room you see loras taking off the antlered helmet.
benefits:
1. gives added weight to renly earlier in the season (the only recognisable characters in his camp are loras, margaery, brienne and renly himself, all very young and inexperienced, lending weight to i-started-this-war-by-kidnapping-an-innocent-dwarf-with-no-idea-what-i-was-going-to-do-next cat's holier than thou 'playing at war' crap).
2. showing an actual transfer of stormlands power from renly to stannis without any dialogue and with a scene lasting seconds, instead of littlefinger's exposition-heavy explanation to the tyrells.
3. viewers understand the whole renly's ghost thing (makes it clear why stannis' men rout, and it's a cool/clever idea, lets the tyrells make one last homage to renly before they complete the alliance with the lannisters)
4. foreshadows and therefore makes more believable stannis' regret over murdering renly in episode 10.
5. doesn't leave viewers wondering wtf the white horse was all about.
george, i await you're invitation to help you with winds so that it gets released at some point in the next decade.
Edit: And have Littlefinger enter the throne room with Tywin and Loras, with close up of him with a sly grin on his face before the fade to black. This would reinforce that it was LF who brought Lannister and Tyrell together, effectively shaping how the season would turn out, and repair some of the damage done to LF's subtle puppet-master image after the hammering the writers have given it this season (pointlessly threatening Cersei, pointlessly threatening Ros, hey Cat I've just brought you the bones of your husband who I betrayed, by the way do you wanna hook up?)

2491	Ser Hippie	2012-05-27	Anyone else feel they did a really good job of making up for the somewhat hit-or-miss depiction of Sansa so far this season. Sophie Turner has been really great, but I think that - because Sansa is a very introspective character in ACOK - the show wasn't always making her growth quite clear. However, I think this episode was really a great one for her as a character (and Sophie as an actress).
- The Sandor/Sansa scene, while slightly different, still conveyed a lot of emotion
- Calming the other ladies down
- The snappy comebacks to Joffrey and Tyrion*
- Conversations with Cersei
*Speaking of this, I think the implicit message when she said she would pray for Tyrion's safe return just like she would Joffrey's will set up her disgust at their marriage really well. It makes clear that, while Tyrion is a nicer guy to her, he still is and always will be a Lannister first and foremost.
2492	Dragon of Valyria	2012-05-28	Reposted from the main thread: What an episode. Sophie Turner was MAGNIFICENT. As per usual, she kills every scene she's in. Both the devious insousciance with Joffrey and the terror when talking with Cersei--nailed it. I like that Sansa is basically this brave, angelic counterpart to the cynical, world-weary Cersei. While Cersei is losing it and attacking Lancel, Sansa thinks of the others and tries to buoy their spirits. What a queenly thing to do. Magnificent.Good point about her remarks to Tyrion--I think at first he was surprised, as I was, that she would wish him well--but then the bit about Joffrey made it clear how Lannisters really stand in her mind. She's learning the game of verbal sparring, even whilst still being a bit of an ingenue. Remarkable. I wonder if it means that by the end, she'll learn the tricks of the trade whilst still remaining ultimately a good person. I'd like to hope so.I think this episode did a huge amount to develop her as a character, especially given how they chose to portray her in season one. I never doubted her for a second, but this episode shows that she has a kind heart (in contrast to her earlier portrayals, which were allegedly "bratty.")
2493	The Last Reyne	2012-05-28	Yes, its nice to see the Sansa from the books begin to make an appearance.*Speaking of this, I think the implicit message when she said she would pray for Tyrion's safe return just like she would Joffrey's will set up her disgust at their marriage really well. It makes clear that, while Tyrion is a nicer guy to her, he still is and always will be a Lannister first and foremost.Well said.
2494	Chalkius Stark	2012-05-28	She's coming across as much smarter and switched on than before, which is good as part of her character development. Gonna love it when she moves in with Littlefinger!
2495	addie	2012-05-28	These scenes with Cersei were magnificient, and you can feel how much she is leraning with Cersei as she will from Littlefinger later on.
2496	Crown	2012-05-28	Just saw next week's preview, seems like we're getting a Sansa/Littlefinger scene. Can't wait to see it!
2497	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-28	I loved the scene with Joffrey and Sansa, what she said to Joffrey and the looks they exchanged. Joffrey knows she hates him, but she's able to say it in a way he can't punish her.
And, then Tyrion and Sansa. Great build-up for their marriage. He's a Lannister to her, after all.
2498	Gogossos	2012-05-28	The first time I came across Sansa after Ned beheading, both in the books and in the show, I was curious to see how she gets her resolve. In the books we have the internal dialogue to clue us in and in the show the story relies on Sophie's acting. And how great is she? After Ned's death, she had this glaze over her eyes where there was brightness before. This year the writers have made her confide in Shae in order to portray her true feelings but she doesn't need that if she continues in the same vein as that retort to Tyrion
2499	Ser Erebus	2012-05-28	Sophie Turner's acting has gotten better and better. I can imagine Sansa being a very difficult character to write and portray considering the dangers of going too bratty. Sophie has been nailing it this season and its great to see the writing giving her the opportunity to portray Sansa from the books. The Scene with Joffrey and Tyrion was great! I was worried it would be difficult to pull off Sansa's revulsion at her marriage considering their relationship with Tyrion up until this point. I would hate to have seen it bundled and have the audience turn against Sansa for randomly hating Tyrion.
2500	Davos55	2012-05-28	Sophie Turner really was amazing this episode. I have always loved her as Sansa, and it was nice for her to  have many moments to shine and show off her acting chops throughout this hour.  She is such a beautiful young actress who in my opinion has only been getting better and better.  She was very funny in the commentary last year on one episode, and she fits the role of Sansa so well.
Amazing performance..keep up the great work Sophie!!
2501	Darth Pipes	2012-05-28	Yeah, I thought her acting was really good tonight.
Another detail that I loved was her picking up the doll that Ned had gotten her last season.  A callback I never expected.
2502	Mooncat	2012-05-28	I'm so happy to see a Sansa that equals her character in the books. Her character arc took leaps and bounds in the episode, but without taking away from the plot. The scene with the Hound was great, if still a little creepy. Her complete disgust of everything Lannister also helped to pave the way for the future. I didn't even mind her relationship with Shae in this episode!
2503	Lyanna Stark	2012-05-28	So you know WTF? Sansa now seems like the thickest person in the Universe, which will be GREAT when she doesn't like being married to Tyrion and 90% of the fans will rage that she doesn't automatically love him.
*facepalm*
2504	Wouter	2012-05-28	Anyone else feel they did a really good job of making up for the somewhat hit-or-miss depiction of Sansa so far this season. Sophie Turner has been really great, but I think that - because Sansa is a very introspective character in ACOK - the show wasn't always making her growth quite clear. However, I think this episode was really a great one for her as a character (and Sophie as an actress).- The Sandor/Sansa scene, while slightly different, still conveyed a lot of emotion- Calming the other ladies down- The snappy comebacks to Joffrey and Tyrion*- Conversations with Cersei*Speaking of this, I think the implicit message when she said she would pray for Tyrion's safe return just like she would Joffrey's will set up her disgust at their marriage really well. It makes clear that, while Tyrion is a nicer guy to her, he still is and always will be a Lannister first and foremost.It was an excellent episode overall, but I do a couple of problems with the way Sansa was portrayed (not with Sandor mind - he was softened a bit, like many others on the show, but this is probably necessary for the show).The first is the point you raise above: I agree that Sansa told Tyrion, in an underhanded way, that she actually would rather have it he died ("I pray for you like I pray for Joffrey" - Tyrion no doubt understood what that meant!) in the battle, so Stannis would win. In the books, Sansa actually prayed for his safety in the battle, despite wanting Stannis to win there too. And given that show Sansa has less reasons to not be fond at all of Tyrion (in the books, he announced in public, with her present, that there would be no exchange of prisoners on Robb's terms and that the way Sansa was treated would depend on Robb's actions), it comes across as being somewhat ungrateful even if Tyrion is fighting for the wrong side. I hope this does not mean the show is setting her up to be blamed for the coldness of their marriage.The second point is that they may have gone too far a bit in softening Sandor; while the implicit threat of rape has been understandably removed (I guess that is necessary if they want the audience to feel some sympathy for Sandor in the future), they also took out him threatening her with a knife and making her sing, and he was generally less drunk and threatening than in the corresponding book scene. As a result, I fear it makes no sense for show followers (who have not read the books, like those on the unspoiled speculation thread over on TWOP) that Sansa didn't just go with him. In the books, Sansa has good reasons not to go with him (seeing as he seemed just as likely to rape or kill as to save her) but I'm afraid this didn't come over well in the show.
2505	Lord Godric	2012-05-28	I'm honestly surprised at the love for Sophie Turner's acting here.  Because I think she has been absolutely horrible.  Maybe it is the monotony of the emotions Sansa is supposed to convey but I think Sophie Turner has major facial expression problems when acting.  And I know that people are going to say she is supposed to have a deadpan delivery of everything because she doesn't really mean anything she is saying but I think she was this way last season too when she had a much larger range of emotions.
With that said she was better in this episode.  Her scenes with Cersei probably stole the show away from all the amazing action scenes we saw outside (which were absolutely great too).
2506	Grail King	2012-05-28	I'm honestly surprised at the love for Sophie Turner's acting here.  Because I think she has been absolutely horrible.  Maybe it is the monotony of the emotions Sansa is supposed to convey but I think Sophie Turner has major facial expression problems when acting.

Her scenes with Cersei probably stole the show away from all the amazing action scenes we saw outside (which were absolutely great too).I actually think she is quite good for her first time, I think she started to come into her own at the end of season one with the death of Ned.For the most part her emotions have to be kept in check just like in the books, but when she has any emotional scenes she nails them, Neds death, the beating and stripping in front of the court, the rape scene etc. all well done for a 15-16 year old in her first major role with people years more experienced than her.I say she's holding her own.
2507	Caro99	2012-05-28	i've always liked sophie's acting, (i hated that LF told her about the hound's scars, but sophie's face as she hears that story was really well done) and of course after "baelor" she's appears to really get the character. i think both her body language and her face expression can convey many of sansa's internal dialogues from the books, so i can see a great actress on the making. last night's episode only proved to be yet another hard acting challenge she managed to overcome brilliantly, and even if the san/san scene wasn't what i wanted, i think both sophie and rory did a great job with what they were allowed to do
edit: and i was happy to see sansa telling tyrion she was praying for him to end up probably just like joff in her mind. so happy we won't have her suddenly falling into his arms when they marry, but now more people may get her less cause tyrion is in the show basically the good guy. so she'll come off as an ungratful girl or something, instead of a victim of a forced marriage to a man whose family destroyed hers... and in the books tyrion never really understood nor even took the time to come to know her, yet in the show we have him now thrices sort of admiring her... i can already imagine sophie's great acting during her wedding to tyrion, crying and refusing to kneel down

2508	Woman of War	2012-05-28	Sophie Turner has  actually grown in this episode. Finally she appeared as the teenage girl she is supposed to be in the series, not as the frightened little girl, acting far too young for her age as she has done so far. I liked her in the farewell scene with Joffrey and Tyrion, she actually seemed  rather sharp. And she was not a meek, passive little bird with Sandor but she had some standing when she refused to go with him. That was easier actually because the rapey aspect of that encounter was not there, Sandor acted more like a very twisted father figure who was honest with offering support, not lashing out with that creepy mixture of violence and craving for closeness and sexual dominance.  And that more adult Sansa could afford holding the doll and remembering her father without being childish like Sansa of season one would have appeared. Sandor referring to Ned fitted in here as well.
2509	SerMixalot	2012-05-28	I think sophie is doing an oustanding job in her role.  This season for her (and parralleling her book story) has been about controlling her emotions.  Not letting the anger and hatred she feels come out.  That requires the dead pan delivery, stunted speaking, etc.  She rises above the common actress by expressing the emotions underlying her words, through the brief halts, her eyes, her body language, the pause when she goes to kiss the sword.  These little things show the anger and hatred and pain she is experiencing.
2510	Aslerys	2012-05-28	Sophie is doing  a very good job. Sansa is not easy to play and I'm quite happy to see that Sophie seems to understand the complexity of the character, not all 15/ 16 year old girls would be able to do that, besides I just love her accent she really sounds like a proper lady... /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
2511	Kittykatknits	2012-05-28	I think Sophie is doing a great job with her role. She's nailed every scene we've seen her in this season. I loved seeing her delivery to Tyrion during last night's episode, her scenes with Cersei were great. It was so obvious who the real queen was there.
Sansa is a very internal character but Sophie is doing a great job of getting her character across despite this. I love her.
2512	kephv	2012-05-28	I think Sophie's been fantastic this season and last. It's just a shame Sansa hasn't received more screen time this season.
2513	TheSwordOfTheEvening	2012-05-28	definitely liking her better than the first season. lookin better too /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />

Her scenes with Cersei probably stole the show away from all the amazing action scenes we saw outside (which were absolutely great too).What are you talking about? Sophie Turner's facial expressions have been amazing! Especially this season, and especially this episode. Go back and rewatch them when she is talking to Joffrey in the Throne room before he goes out to the battlements. When she says, "your right your Grace, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest, and he is just a pretender". She was truly amazing there. I don't know how anybody could think otherwise. Not to mention her lines with Shae and Cersei.
2515	Ser Hippie	2012-05-28	I hope this does not mean the show is setting her up to be blamed for the coldness of their marriage.'Unfortunately, I think she's going to get blamed regardless (Tyrion's a popular character to begin with and Dinklage is more or less the face of the show) - so while I agree that the popular view that Sansa is at fault is wrong, I guess I'm just happier with people feeling that way because she's "ungrateful" and views him as a Lannister now and forever and his looks aren't really as big a part of it (at least I suspect they won't be) as that leads to a lot of the "Sansa's a superficial bitch" type commentary.As a result, I fear it makes no sense for show followers (who have not read the books, like those on the unspoiled speculation thread over on TWOP) that Sansa didn't just go with him. In the books, Sansa has good reasons not to go with him (seeing as he seemed just as likely to rape or kill as to save her) but I'm afraid this didn't come over well in the show.I'm not sure about this myself either. Some non-readers I've seen have put forth that Stannis was about to win the battle and Sansa preferred to rely on him than a drunken Sandor she doesn't really know. I haven't seen as much hand wringing as I feared, but maybe more will come out once the aftereffects of "wow wildfire!", etc. wear off.
2516	Kittykatknits	2012-05-28	Unfortunately, I think she's going to get blamed regardless (Tyrion's a popular character to begin with and Dinklage is more or less the face of the show) - so while I agree that the popular view that Sansa is at fault is wrong, I guess I'm just happier with people feeling that way because she's "ungrateful" and views him as a Lannister now and forever and his looks aren't really as big a part of it (at least I suspect they won't be) as that leads to a lot of the "Sansa's a superficial bitch" type commentary.I'm pretty certain this will happen no matter what HBO does going forward. Every person I have talked to IRL who watches the show but has not read the books absolutely loves Tyrion.
2517	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-05-28	I can already see them setting Sansa up to be blamed for not loving Tyrion...
they've already vastly changed the dynamics of his relationship with shae, for example.  they have tyrion and shae actually expressing true emotions!
in the books, despite his occasional forays into fantasy, she was his paid whore and he reminded her of her place on many an occasion.
but then again....HBO may decide to have Sansa more sympathetic towards him in the show

2519	Envie	2012-05-29	I thought Sophie's acting in season 1 was a little rough but she did a fair job of portraying Sansa the way I thought of her from the books. Season 2 has been a much better round of acting so she's clearly really getting into her role now and of course everything's changing dramatically for Sansa so her scenes have been really much more epic with the near rape, throne room humiliation, and now these fantastic scenes with Cersei over the past few episodes. Just fantastic.
As for fans hating Sansa because she doesn't love Tyrion... I don't think most of you are giving viewers who don't read the books enough credit. Despite a whole lot of Tyrion fanfare, I think most people can easily relate to a young girl's emotions like Sansa in this situation. Particularly considering all the setup they've given her with the many 'wooden face' scenes where she simply parrots the words she knows everyone wants to hear. No one is going to blame her for being even more unhappy once she's forced to wed Tyrion. If anything, it will simply lend even more empathy to her while at the same time giving Tyrion even more mad props.
2520	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2012-05-29	I really like the nice touch of her holding on to the doll that Ned gave her.  They probably won't be able to do the snow castle scene, so that doll will probably stay with her as the thing that reminds her that she's a Stark, and gives her the courage to face whatever is coming.
2521	Bastard of Boston	2012-05-29	"Joffrey will. The worst ones always live." Loved it. Sophie is hit or miss with me, but this is baptism by fire. She's not the phenom Maisie is, but she's putting in the work. And, Sansa isn't the easiest role.

2522	Harrad	2012-05-29	Good point about her remarks to Tyrion--I think at first he was surprised, as I was, that she would wish him well--but then the bit about Joffrey made it clear how Lannisters really stand in her mind.As BlueQueen pointed out this is a case of using the same words twice but having the opposite meaning in the two cases. Sansa begins talking cordially with Tyrion, the person who has helped protect her from Joffrey, and sincerely wishes him protection in battle. At that moment Joffrey walks in and she switches to her rote response to also wish Joffrey well, but this has the opposite meaning directed at that sadist. Her best personal outcome for the battle would be Joffrey killed, Tyrion surviving, and Stannis defeated.

2523	Every	2012-05-29	I think Sophie owns this role. I agree sometimes she acts a little immature, but I think that's the point of Sansa's character at this stage - Sansa is an immature girl plunged into a very adult situation. She's growing up fast, but it's not going to happen overnight and nor should it.
I did think the scene with the Hound didn't make much sense with the changes. When they removed that sense of threat from the scene, they also removed the reason for Sansa to choose not to go with him. In the show universe, it seems a bit implausible that this man she apparently trusts offers to help her escape, and she refuses for no obvious reason.

Without establishing Dontos as her "escape route", it makes no sense for her not to go with Sandor. Sandor said he would protect her, and he specifically said he would take her home to Winterfell, and Sansa said "you won't hurt me", as a statement. So there was no reason in the show, for Sansa to not go with him. I get that we are suppose to think Sansa was counting on Stannis to win, and she didn't think Stannis would hurt her. That doesn't make sense though, Stannis won't hurt her, but he definitely wouldn't take her home either. Stannis considered Robb an enemy, so he isn't going to just send Sansa to her mom. So even though Stannis would have kept her safe, she also knows Sandor would to, and since Sandor specifically offered to take her to Winterfell, it makes no sense that she wouldn't go with him. Especially when you consider Stannis hadn't completely taken the city at that point, so anything could have happened. For all Sansa knows, right after Sandor left, Ser Ilyn could have showed up, or Cersei, you know? There was no certainty that Sansa would ever see Stannis at the point when Sandor made his offer. Also, most young people usually take the fast payout, instead of the longer road, even if the longer roud is the better choice, because young people don't think ahead like that. So again, I say it doesn't make much sense.

In the books it's far more obvious why she doesn't go with him, but show!Sandor is not nearly as socially inept as book!Sandor.

Stannis considered Robb an enemy, so he isn't going to just send Sansa to her mom.I'm not so sure. Stannis did make quite a point of offering Cat Joff and Cersei's heads for what they did to Ned; I could easily see him shipping Sansa back to Winterfell. Robb would be his one ally against the remaining Lannister-Tyrell alliance, no?Stannis even straight up told Cat that he would send her girls back to her, if either of them were in King's Landing when he took the city.

2527	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-29	I'm not so sure. Stannis did make quite a point of offering Cat Joff and Cersei's heads for what they did to Ned; I could easily see him shipping Sansa back to Winterfell. Robb would be his one ally against the remaining Lannister-Tyrell alliance, no?Stannis even straight up told Cat that he would send her girls back to her, if either of them were in King's Landing when he took the city.Indeed he did. But, he did name Robb to die when Melisandre asked to name someone. I never forgive him that, although I want him to take the Iron Throne.It's just too bad that they didn't give Sansa a valid reason to refuse to go with the Hound. I mean; in the books it was obvious why, although I probably would go with him regardless. In the show however, I would totally go with him, there was absolutely no reason why she wouldn't. As Sansa says; He won't hurt her.
2528	YTDN	2012-05-29	I think Sansa's reasoning is that, if she goes with Sandor, she'll end up on the run through the war-torn countryside, her only protection being a man who, while he said he wouldn't hurt her, still admits to finding killing fun. Staying and waiting for Stannis means she would be even as a prisoner in relative safety and security, and probably has more chance of being reunited with her family as part of some treaty than running of into the unknown with Sandor.
2529	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-29	Indeed he did. But, he did name Robb to die when Melisandre asked to name someone.

As Sansa says; He won't hurt her.Yeah, that's true. He didn't even beat around the bush: he says he'd take her home to Winterfell. She's not even "met" Ser Dontos the Fool yet, so it's not like she has anything else going for her other than the (possible) belief that Stannis would treat her well. She's also just spent an evening learning about highborn girls being raped during a city's fall...
2530	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-29	Yeah, that's true. He didn't even beat around the bush: he says he'd take her home to Winterfell.

She's also just spent an evening learning about highborn girls being raped during a city's fall...Yeah, I didn't really bought everything Cersei said about rape and so on. Stannis is a just man (cutting off fingers of the man who saved him, afterwards naming him a Lord), he wouldn't let his men sack the whole city and rape every woman etc. like the Lannisters did during Robert's Rebellion. Anyway, HBO better come up with something good for Sansa, to prevent her from being called the shallow arrogant bitch who should've gone with Sandor.
2531	SerMixalot	2012-05-29	I am in the process of reading aSoS and there really isnt alot of meat to show Tyrion in a bad light pre marriage.  Some potentially great scenes with tywin but nothing that shows him to be the rapscallion he is.
2532	Clariana	2012-05-29	I thought her turning down Sandor was an act of courage... That she saw staying in King's Landing as part of her duty emblemised by the doll that Ned gave her, however bitter she found it, and refused to run away like a coward.
2533	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-29	Anyway, HBO better come up with something good for Sansa, to prevent her from being called the shallow arrogant bitch who should've gone with Sandor.It'll happen anyway in my opinion when she's forced into marrying Tyrion; they've glossed over pretty much all of Tyrion's flaws, while Sansa is still portrayed as relatively "human," given her situation. To your average viewer, she'll probably come off as a bitch who can't look past Tyrion's deformity (Dinklage's Tyrion is a good-looking, fundamentally kind and intelligent guy who just happens to be a dwarf, after all), when by rights they should be looking at her with a lot more sympathy. It's the danger they're running by making Tyrion the unambiguous hero of the show.Well, unless they change the intricacies of their mock-marriage... a lot.

Some potentially great scenes with tywin but nothing that shows him to be the rapscallion he is.Maybe they could use the scene with Tywin when Tyrion is told he's going to marry Sansa. He doesn't necessarily think of her as someone he could love, but merely as the Key to the North. That should place him in a bad light, marrying Sansa only for her claim, not caring about what she wants.

But, they already made Tyrion the unambiguous hero of the show. All of his scenes are flawless, he slaps Joffrey multiple times including the sentence 'Did my hand fall of my wrist?' etc etc. The only scene which could show his flaws is the scene in which he's going to marry Sansa just for her claim. But then the producers should make that very clear which I know they won't.I already feel sorry for Sansa right now.
2536	never trust a bard	2012-05-29	The actress was phenomenal this week.  Loved her comment to Tyrion.  Definitely believe she meant it as we all took it. I think the show's done a fine job of reminding us that Tyrion is hated by the world no matter what good he does.  Sure, he gets his credit at the Blackwater, but the whole town blames him for all the harm Joeffrey's done to the kingdom.  I think it will be easy for viewers to see why Sansa won't love Tyrion.  As long as she remains a "ward" of the Lannisters, her trust/love of any Lannister would seem unbelievable.
2537	Harrad	2012-05-29	The actress was phenomenal this week.  Loved her comment to Tyrion.  Definitely believe she meant it as we all took it. I think the show's done a fine job of reminding us that Tyrion is hated by the world no matter what good he does.

As long as she remains a "ward" of the Lannisters, her trust/love of any Lannister would seem unbelievable.To think that Sansa would think the same of the Lannister that is hitting her as the Lannister that stops the hitting demeans her. If you look at the sequence of events she speaks in a non-robotic way to Tyrion, meaning what she says to him. Then Joffrey comes in the room and she reverts to Robo-San, mouthing the same words and obviously not meaning them.As far as Tyrion using Sansa for his own purposes in their upcoming wedding....no....Tryion is a good soldier for the Lannisters and agrees to it, despite not wanting to do it. This is clear in the book.
2538	Juliads	2012-05-29	I thought her turning down Sandor was an act of courage... That she saw staying in King's Landing as part of her duty emblemised by the doll that Ned gave her, however bitter she found it, and refused to run away like a coward.could be, personally i would have assumed that when the queen had Ned imprisoned, and finally when the new king had him executed that all sense of duty or responsibility she might have felt was gone.

2539	Grail King	2012-05-29	"Joffrey will. The worst ones always live." Loved it. Sophie is hit or miss with me, but this is baptism by fire. She's not the phenom Maisie is, but she's putting in the work. And, Sansa isn't the easiest role.I think Maisie is OK, she's no phenom though, she has no real emotional roles as of yet, Sophie on the other hand has to make a entitled spoiled girl going through her flowering, physically watch her father beheaded, beaten by supposed  future husband, betrayed by future mother in law, stripped naked, berated as stupid, forced to marry a deformed son of the family who help kill her family seem real and she does; she is emotionally blank when she needs to be, bitchy when needed,caring, manipulative, Brave, scared and Queenly and her zingers to Joff and Tyrion  are on the money.Maisie is good for her age but Sophie packs the emotional drive that makes her portrayal work.
2540	Wouter	2012-05-29	Unfortunately, I think she's going to get blamed regardless (Tyrion's a popular character to begin with and Dinklage is more or less the face of the show) - so while I agree that the popular view that Sansa is at fault is wrong, I guess I'm just happier with people feeling that way because she's "ungrateful" and views him as a Lannister now and forever and his looks aren't really as big a part of it (at least I suspect they won't be) as that leads to a lot of the "Sansa's a superficial bitch" type commentary.I hadn't looked at it like that yet. I'm fine with it as long as show-Tyrion still ambushes her with the wedding (together with the other Lannisters) the way it happens in the books - no advance warning, only given her a (non)choice after Cersei and Joffrey have already commanded her to marry Tyrion and while the guests are already waiting (minus the Tyrells who also only got told at the last minute, I suppose). If it happens like that, people can then refer to the scene in "Blackwater" to point out that she never liked any Lannister (post-"Baelor"), even Tyrion.I don't think the show will have her liking Tyrion much better though (maybe a little, especially if he stops short of the bedding scene as I suspect show-Tyrion might). The plot still has to go on as it does.to Harrad;As far as Tyrion using Sansa for his own purposes in their upcoming wedding....no....Tryion is a good soldier for the Lannisters and agrees to it, despite not wanting to do it. This is clear in the book.Tyrion does agree to it, not because he is forced to do so by Tywin (Tyrion has refused Tywin on other counts, before, Shae being foremost among them), but because he is a good soldier for the Lannisters as you say (and thus a clear enemy of Sansa, certainly in this particular situation where her interest and the Lannisters are as opposed as they possibly could be) and because he is swayed by Tywin's arguments of getting Winterfell. Plus, both his thoughts as he was getting swayed and his thoughts afterwards (even in "Dance", here and there) make it clear he did like the idea of getting the pretty wife that Tywin had assured him he was never going to get otherwise.to Ser Mixalot;I am in the process of reading aSoS and there really isnt alot of meat to show Tyrion in a bad light pre marriage. Some potentially great scenes with tywin but nothing that shows him to be the rapscallion he is.They don't need to show Tyrion in a bad light (ASOS pre-marriage doesn't show him in any particularly bad light, no need to force anything) before the marriage, they only need to show the Lannisters - all of them - going along with screwing Sansa over. Few people are not going to sympathise with Sansa is she is only being told of her very own wedding 5 minutes beforehand.

2542	Caro99	2012-05-29	i still wonder why the show had cersei mentioning that if stannis won it would take him some time to take the red keep, and since he isn't going to spare her, she was going to have herself and sansa killed by ser illy. we see her telling this to sansa, so it's a little odd (since in the books sansa is terrified of ser illyn) that she would be willing to wait in KL since by the time stannis sat the iron throne she would probably be headless.. yeah, they  had shae telling her that in her rooms she would be safe from ser illyn and stannis wouldn't hurt her, but oh well, just another little diffrence from the book.
i got a no-book reader friend today be the first person i think i've seen commenting that sandor was the one at fauly in the show for sanas not going with him, instead of sansa coming of as foolish for not going with him. he said that he left her too quickly after he told her that he wouldn't hurt her and basically she had no time to make up her mind if she ought to go with him or not.
2543	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-05-29	aaaaah but maybe he left because he felt he was not good enough for her...........
he doubted himself
2544	Caro99	2012-05-29	aaaaah but maybe he left because he felt he was not good enough for her...........he doubted himselfyeah, and since that's pretty much one of the reasons why he left in the books, i want to give him a hug /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' /> can you imagine him deathbed confession, full of self-loathing and tears?! rory, you better give us some manly tears then cause you didn't cry this past sunday... though he also cries during the dondarrion fight/trial, so more rory scenes where he is scared of fire ( /crying.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':crying:' />  again)
2545	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2012-05-29	Haha, nice one. But, they already made Tyrion the unambiguous hero of the show. All of his scenes are flawless, he slaps Joffrey multiple times including the sentence 'Did my hand fall of my wrist?' etc etc. The only scene which could show his flaws is the scene in which he's going to marry Sansa just for her claim. But then the producers should make that very clear which I know they won't.I already feel sorry for Sansa right now.Don't feel sorry for her, they'll make it that Tyrion be completely understanding of her distrust of him and the marriage, they'll having him make no effort to bed her.  They'll not have him resent her for not kneeling, they will have her submit to the consummation but have Tyrion nobly turn it down, reassuring her that he knows it's a sham marriage and that he'll keep her safe and have it annulled at a later date.That way Sansa doesn't come across as a bitch, and Tyrion looks that much more heroic.

Hardly a refusal. Likewise he does not refuse Tywin with regards to Sansa. However, since he never beds Sansa, how much advantage is he taking of this "pretty wife." Zero.
2547	Bronn Stone	2012-05-30	I think Maisie is OK, she's no phenom though, she has no real emotional roles as of yet,The emotional bit that Maisie absoultely nailed was the scene in which Jon gave her Needle.   Every time I watch that scene I am reminded of my own sister, and the wonder in her eye when given special attention from an older brother.  You can see in Maisie's eye that she loves her new 'toy' but loves it all that much more in that it came from her brother.Plus there is her bit on the statue of Baelor.  If you don't watch that and definitely believe a little girl realizes her father is going to be executed, you aren't watching the same show I am.   It is all there in her face AND in her body language.   She was even better there than she was when Mycah died - which was actually pretty good as well.Sophie got more to work with this season than Maisie got last (and Sophie was great), but to say Maisie got none is more than a bit foolish.

2549	Caro99	2012-05-30	someone mentioned how the doll detail was added since maybe they won't be able to shoot the building of the snow castle... this i think would be a mistake cause that scene s just beautifyl and sad to read, and it also kind of mirrors the end of sansa's childhood, so they ought to shoo it!

2550	Wouter	2012-05-30	He "refuses" Tywin with regards to Shae by sneaking behind his back. Hardly a refusal. Likewise he does not refuse Tywin with regards to Sansa. However, since he never beds Sansa, how much advantage is he taking of this "pretty wife." Zero.He got zero out of it (less than zero, actually, considering he got mocked and was never comfortable near her) but that wasn't what he had been hoping for, beforehand. Tyrion fell for Tywin's slick selling speech and he did not exactly seem to expect that Sansa could be colder than the Wall for such a period of time. He also seems to have planned to go ahead with the "bedding" (including what we now would call rape, even if the average Westerosi might not view it as such) until he realised how revulsed and shocked Sansa was. Tyrion had hoped it would all work out; for once he was believing in the fancy songs, rather than Sansa.

It really changed my mind about this scene. I can't do it justice now, but essentially it came down to the fact that she isn't ready yet to leave. The doll was a rather obvious symbol here but it pointed out that she was still a child so it is to soon for her to embrace or even understand what leaving with him would mean. So, she doesn't go.He "refuses" Tywin with regards to Shae by sneaking behind his back. Hardly a refusal. Likewise he does not refuse Tywin with regards to Sansa. However, since he never beds Sansa, how much advantage is he taking of this "pretty wife." Zero.Well, considering that marrying her gives him the entire North with the knowledge that she would either have to remain a hostage her entire life or be killed off, I'd say he took advantage of her quite a bit.
2552	Harrad	2012-05-30	Well, considering that marrying her gives him the entire North with the knowledge that she would either have to remain a hostage her entire life or be killed off, I'd say he took advantage of her quite a bit.Wrong. He doesn't get a bit of "the entire North." That's a pipe dream of Tywin. And you see where his dreams ended. On the shitter. Furthermore, anyone marrying Sansa would get her inheritance if he could hold it and her. That is hardly taking advantage of her. That is part of the world they live in.

So, she doesn't go.yeah, the doll was certainly a symbolism to sansa's childhood. when i first watched the scene and thought that she was going to go with him, i though that having them showing sansa sort of dropping her doll was her ready to leave the sansa from AGoT behind, but even now that i've watched it many times i still see them having her holding on to the doll the whole time as a sort of parallel to her not ready to leave her childhood behind just yet (and in the books she still has another one till she starts to become a woman).. thy have the doll between her and sandor, so once girlhood is behind maybe nothing can come between them. and maybe the doll was also there to remind sandor she is as he said himself once, "almost a woman," but she is not quite there yet.

2554	Dragon of Valyria	2012-05-30	As BlueQueen pointed out this is a case of using the same words twice but having the opposite meaning in the two cases. Sansa begins talking cordially with Tyrion, the person who has helped protect her from Joffrey, and sincerely wishes him protection in battle. At that moment Joffrey walks in and she switches to her rote response to also wish Joffrey well, but this has the opposite meaning directed at that sadist. Her best personal outcome for the battle would be Joffrey killed, Tyrion surviving, and Stannis defeated.Both are plausible, I think. She did genuinely seem thankful and surprised when Tyrion intervened on her behalf (that was a very touching scene, when she looked at him extending his hand to her) but then she immediately put herself back on guard right afterwards. I think she's unsure if she can trust a Lannister and is probably wondering why he saved her (she's also not privy to the fact that Tyrion wanted the Kingsguard to seek her out during the riots).That said, she's also fundamentally kind-hearted. She did seem to be better disposed towards Tyrion than she was towards Joffrey, and her tone did shift between referring to the two of them. I think it's clear that Tyrion took it badly, though.Wrong. He doesn't get a bit of "the entire North." That's a pipe dream of Tywin. And you see where his dreams ended. On the shitter. Furthermore, anyone marrying Sansa would get her inheritance if he could hold it and her. That is hardly taking advantage of her. That is part of the world they live in.It's not. There's usual mutual advantage, and a consent element too--there is no advantage to the Starks, and nobody consented to it: with the male Starks presumed dead and no guardian appointed, Sansa should hold that right. She was forced into a marriage against her will in order to steal her birthright. That is fundamentally unjust even in a society as backwards as the Sunset Kingdoms.
2555	Harrad	2012-05-30	That is fundamentally unjust even in a society as backwards as the Sunset Kingdoms.The point is that Tyrion did not seek this marriage and only consented to it after much misgivings because he was forced to by his family and he also knew Sansa's other options were even worse. He did not even demand his husbandly rights, another facet of that, and other "modern", societies. His marrying Sansa was the best plausible thing that could happen to her under the circumstances. Later, when the circumstances changed, she was able to escape.
2556	Christina Ceriddwynn	2012-05-30	He chose to marry her because he thought "oooh......I get the pretty girl AND a nice inheritance!!!"  Then, when reality struck that this pretty girl hated him......he backed off and regretted it.
No one forced him to wed her.  They couldve married her off to Lancel at the time....who, btw, hasn't consummated his marriage yet, either.
His other option was Lollys......but it was a bitter pill to realize the pretty girl viewed HIM as the male version Lollys
2557	Kittykatknits	2012-05-31	The point is that Tyrion did not seek this marriage and only consented to it after much misgivings because he was forced to by his family and he also knew Sansa's other options were even worse. He did not even demand his husbandly rights, another facet of that, and other "modern", societies. His marrying Sansa was the best plausible thing that could happen to her under the circumstances. Later, when the circumstances changed, she was able to escape.He wasn't forced to do it at all. His father and uncle played him, saying exactly what they knew would most tempt Tyrion. Jaime refused just fine. And Tyrion's reaction during this scene doesn't reflect any misgivings. He had a "queer feeling" in his stomach when he realized that he would be getting "pretty sweet smelling Sansa Stark". Sounds like he was rather excited about getting her inheritance and a young, beautiful girl. No force there at all.Of course, we know it completely blew up in his face, but he married her for very selfish reasons.As for not having sex on their wedding night, as a general rule I don't give people gold stars for not  raping anyone. He knew it was wrong but did finally back down. But, first he made her strip and then fondled her. It is also very clear that he did plan on consummating their marriage at first. There is also textual evidence that marital rape is considered wrong in Westeros. Cersei told Robert that he would hurt her and he felt guilt about it - showing that even he recognized his behavior was wrong.This wasn't an arranged marriage which has benefits for both families. This was a forced marriage with no advantage for the bride's family at all, big difference.Edit: Spelling

2558	Roboginger	2012-06-01	I'm honestly surprised at the love for Sophie Turner's acting here.  Because I think she has been absolutely horrible.  Maybe it is the monotony of the emotions Sansa is supposed to convey but I think Sophie Turner has major facial expression problems when acting.  And I know that people are going to say she is supposed to have a deadpan delivery of everything because she doesn't really mean anything she is saying but I think she was this way last season too when she had a much larger range of emotions.With that said she was better in this episode.  Her scenes with Cersei probably stole the show away from all the amazing action scenes we saw outside (which were absolutely great too).I think Sophie has done a pretty good job, i'm the more surprised by everyone saying Lena Headey did a great job and deserves an Emmy
2559	The Last Reyne	2012-06-02	I think Sophie has done a pretty good job, i'm the more surprised by everyone saying Lena Headey did a great job and deserves an EmmyThat's because Lena Headey did an outstanding job and does deserve an emmy.

That is part of the world they live in.And, considering Bran and Rickon aren't even presumed dead in this version of the story, Sansa is not heir to Robb or the Lady of Winterfell at this point - I think Tyrion's marriage to Sansa is after the Red Wedding.    So, marrying her is worthless.  Unless they tie it up that hte Bastard of Bolton finds them dead when he attacks Winterfell and reclaims it in his father's name - claiming Theon killed the boys during the siege and Winterfell to torch.

So, marrying her is worthless.  I don't think Bran and Rickon will be considered alive for long - as you speculate, they will likely have the Bastard report it to the world after he burns Winterfell (of course he will not report the latter fact entirely truthfully; Theon will get the blame, as in the books).

Unless they tie it up that hte Bastard of Bolton finds them dead when he attacks Winterfell and reclaims it in his father's name - claiming Theon killed the boys during the siege and Winterfell to torch.Nope. They are married before the Red Wedding. Tyrion is told about the RW by Tywin and he is the one to tell Sansa about it. She leaves the room and goes to cry alone in their bedroom. He decides not to go and comfort him because he realizes she would not want that from a Lannister. Smartest decision in their marriage he made.Also, when Tywin manipulates (not forces!) Tyrion in to marrying Sansa, he broadly hints that something is going to happen with Robb soon with his comments about how some wars are won with words and letters rather than swords. It's pretty clear he is planning something to make Sansa the heir. Tywin also states outright that the plan is to use Bolton to "fix" the North and then get rid of him to plant Tyrion's child in WF too.My guess is that the bastard of Bolton will take down WF and inform Roose about the deaths of Bran and Rickon. Roose will then tell Tywin about it when he turns his cloak, setting the stage for the marriage between Tyrion and Sansa and the RW.

He plans to make Sansa Lady of Winterfell.
2564	rezor	2012-06-04	Hmmm. I'm still not a fan of Sophie Turner's acting. She's definitely gotten better but there's something breathless and contrived about her speech patterns that gets on my nerves. Sorry, I know she's becoming a fan favourite now but it does get in the way of my Sansa appreciation. Obviously, Lana Headley is much older and more experienced than her but in terms of acting, they are worlds apart, IMO. Lana made the Cersei/Sansa scenes come alive for me. Sansa was just reacting, but Cersei just purred and owned her way through it all. Now, if only she spoke with a slightly stronger voice then she'd be close to perfect.
2565	Lyanna Stark	2012-06-04	Thanks for the timeline clarification.  But, Sansa is Robb's heir already with Bran and Rickon presumed dead.  He plans to make Sansa Lady of Winterfell.No, that's never going to happen. Sansa as Lady Lannister would remain a hostage to the Lannisters in the south. She would never be permitted to go back north, as if she showed up with Tyrion it would mean some northman would kill him and Sansa would be free to marry one of them instead and produce little Starks that way.The only surefire way the Lannisters can make sure to put one of theirs in Winterfell is to have Sansa as a broodmare in the south and send hers and Tyrion's son north eventually. There have even been speculations that Tywin meant to have Sansa have an "accident" eventually to make it easier to have her sons placed as Stark heirs in Winterfell due to her not being around any more to cause possible inheritance problems.Of course, if Robb's will ever comes to light, we may see that Sansa has been disinherited, but that's another story completely.

2567	scurvy	2012-05-31	In the book Sansa is of extreme value to the Lannisters b/c she's heir to Winterfell because both Bran and Rickon are presumed dead.  With Tywin's conspiracy with the Freys and Boltons Winterfell becomes Sansa's property.  Thus, her marriage to Tyrion becomes extremely valuable to the Lannisters. 
Not only has the lack of news of Bran and Rickon's presumed death not reached Cat and Robb- thus changing their motivations for, respectively, releasing the Kingslayer and falling into the arms of someone other than his betrothed, it now changes the value of Sansa as a prisoner.
I can only expect that the off page Bastard of Bolton's taking of Winterfell and its sacking (falsely blamed on Theon Turncloak) leads to the Ramsay reporting to his father of Bran and Rickon's deaths.  Roose can then notify the Starks and in hatching his plan with Tywin, the Hand of the King as well.
Without the presumed deaths of the boys, Sansa's marriage to Tyrion is just a mummer's farce and gains nothing.
2568	Thendel	2012-06-01	Did I miss something during Season 2? Tyrion and Sansa were married? Will they be in the last episode of this season?
No? Then what are you talking about?

2572	Mulled Wino	2012-06-01	Seems like a non-story as Tyrion and Sansa arent married yet.

2574	Clariana	2012-05-29	Yes, we all regret the absence of some secondaries: Patchface, Jojen & Meera...
But I think the series really deserves some kudos for how accurately it has developed others: the Hound, Lancel (one of my favourites, in particular), Roose Bolton, Poderick Payne, Hot Pie... using just a few seconds of screentime...
What do other readers think?
2575	Mulled Wino	2012-05-29	Tough topic for no Spoilers.  
I think they've done pretty well with weeding out some of the characters, but there's a few id really like to have seen by now.  Especially the Blackfish.
Im reserving full  judgement until i see if a certain liver and onion eating chubby guy is cast.  
Im meh on pod and hot pie so far.  They're ok, but nothing special to me.
2576	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-29	I really liked Pod in this episode, yes. Hot Pie, well, we haven't seen him that much. The other minor characters I would like to see are the Tully-family and the Reeds, and they will come next season.
there are so many characters that some have to be left out. I'm perfectly fine with that, so Ros was quite a mistake. Why give her that much screentime while she isn't even a minor character in the book? 
Oh well, I still think the producers managed to keep as close to the books as they can with their budget and the time per episode.
2577	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-29	I'm disappointed they didn't play up Roose a bit; Michael McElhatton has really nailed the character, but we just don't see him in the same intriguing light Arya did in Clash. Can only hope he shows up at Harrenhal in S3 to meet Jaime and Brienne.
2578	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-29	I'm disappointed they didn't play up Roose a bit; Michael McElhatton has really nailed the character, but we just don't see him in the same intriguing light Arya did in Clash. Can only hope he shows up at Harrenhal in S3 to meet Jaime and Brienne.They have to. I mean, if Talisa won't be Jeyne but indeed some girl of Volantis, then the Red Wedding is altered enough. They need Roose in the next season to make some sort of build-up to the Red Wedding, aside from his bastardson-things. Don't worry about that. (:
2579	Lord Manwoody	2012-05-29	I think the show has done a very good job with the characters and in translating the story to the screen.
When I do questions something, I always remind myself that it would likely mean a sacrifice elsewhere and nobody knows what that would or might have been.
I don't mind the show deviating from the book as long as the story remains intact.  Thus far, I feel like that has been accomplished.
There are aspects of the changes I like.  One being, since I've read the books, I don't know everything that is going to happen in the show.
2580	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-29	They have to. I mean, if Talisa won't be Jeyne but indeed some girl of Volantis, then the Red Wedding is altered enough. They need Roose in the next season to make some sort of build-up to the Red Wedding, aside from his bastardson-things. Don't worry about that. (:A man can hope. I still think they wasted more time than necessary on this NotJeyne/Lady Talisa angle... Wouldn't it have been a lot more powerful if Robb's arc ended with his downfall from the book, where a grief-stricken and injured Robb gives up his oath in a moment of despair and passion to a daughter of his enemy? You know, instead of this burgeoning romance between the king and the "spunky" peasant medic who "just happens" to be a highborn lady? Ugh... /sleep.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt='-_-' />Oh, and since Vargo is in, I want to see his bear. The big black bear. Like Yoren.
2581	Clariana	2012-05-29	Vargo is in? That is good news...
Now, will he 'lipth'?
2582	teemo	2012-05-29	We need way more Roose and way less Talisa.
2583	Chelly	2012-05-29	I agree. I wish there was more Roose. I liked Lancel this episode. It was done very well to set up his transformation in the future. Don't forget Bronn! I honestly don't mind his added scenes.
2584	Clariana	2012-05-29	Agreed on Roose. My non-reader hubby doesn't understand why I squemishly squee at his every appearance...
2585	Darth Vader's Bastard	2012-06-01	jojen and meera have been conformed for season 3. same with blackfish
2586	StannisandDaeny	2012-06-01	I think the strong cast for the minor characters is one of the great things in the show. I liked Jory, liked Barristan and Old Nan immensely, love the cast for Gendry, think they've done a good job on Lysa Tully, pretty much like the guy playing Meryn Trant as well and so on and so forth - it's jjust really well done!
Edit: Just realized I didn't even mention MORD. MORD! And Jaqen ^^

2587	Fylimar	2012-06-01	I loved Podrick - he's one of the minor characters, I liked most in the books and I'm glad, he works so well in the show. And although, Lancel is a character, I don't care for in either books and show, he was very good here.
2588	Harrad	2012-05-27	Will this traveling road show be included in the series? It was the final turnaround for the  Hound in the book. The series can't include everything so maybe this will go. It looks in the previews that Arya does meet Jaquen again--she has to get the coin--but will she go directly to Bravos? That could save some time, but at the expense of the  Hounds redemption.

2590	sennahoj	2012-05-28	I don't believe that Arya will go with Jaqen. I took the Hound's offer to rescue Sansa as a foreshadowing of his travels with Arya. And all the name-dropping of the Brotherhood this season would be pointless if Arya's travels wouldn't also lead her there. So Arya and the Hound are still on.
Plus, if they brought Arya to Braavos earlier than in the books, they'd have to come up with a lot more for her to do there in the meantime, I mean more than they are bound to make up for her anyway. I wouldn't be surprised if the writers somehow managed to have Arya cross paths with another refugee to the Free Cities.
2591	Rapsie	2012-05-28	They would also have to drop the BWB scene which is brilliant. Also Arya getting to the Twins would be difficult and then her journey on to Braavos, well, Braavos is not the most interesting story and she might not be leaving there until season 7 at the earliest. 4 seasons in Braavos? I hope not.
Also the journey between her and the Hound also provides good characters development for Arya. Also there are some really dramatic and funny moments between them.
2592	The Monkey	2012-05-28	Gods help me, no.
The Arya chapters in A Storm of Swords are golden, they would be fools to give it up.

2593	addie	2012-05-28	I hope the Arya / Hound travel is still on, because it's a really nice moment, and I think the Hound has its influence on Arya as well. As the Tickler is dead already, I wonder however if the inn's scene is going to happel (it has, though, because it is were Arya gets Needle back)
2594	Crown	2012-05-28	I hope the Arya / Hound travel is still on, because it's a really nice moment, and I think the Hound has its influence on Arya as well. As the Tickler is dead already, I wonder however if the inn's scene is going to happel (it has, though, because it is were Arya gets Needle back)It has to happen, Arya can't go to Braavos without Needle.
2595	HouseLark	2012-05-28	Why would Arya go with Jaqen? As far as she knows her mother, and brothers are all around Riverrun. She's heading home and is unlikely to follow some dude she barely knows in another direction. My best guess is Arya refuses Jaqen's offer so he gives her the coin as the best way to protect he can without physically being there.
2596	Buster	2012-05-28	Arya's chapters with Sandor are awesome! Skipping them would be unforgivable.
2597	Morvran	2012-05-28	HBO Arya has a ton of growing to do before she heads off for her training.  She's barely even killed anyone yet.
2598	Apoapsis	2012-05-28	It has to happen, Arya can't go to Braavos without Needle.Who has Needle now? Rorge?
2599	The Monkey	2012-05-28	Who has Needle now? Rorge?Polliver.
2600	Maria Underfoot	2012-05-28	I hope their road trip is included..... It was pure fun. Along with Jaime/Brienne, the Arya/Hound interaction is the best IMO. Funny but also interesting and giving insight to both their characters. I think they will include it, otherwise Rory mc Cann will get no more screen time in the show, and I don't think anyone's ready for that
2601	The Maid of Mansfield	2012-05-28	Arya and Sandor's interaction is much needed for Arya's character development. In the simplistic world of television, Sandor's beliefs have pretty much been summed up by "all men are killers" (as he has incessantly repeated during this entire season) and Arya is having a crash course on this sad reality. Much like in the books, Sandor will be paramount for the sedimentation of her "education". He is another step she must go through to form her warrior persona (she is warring through life, that little one).
I hate the concept that some people have of Arya as a cold-blooded killer. I think of her as a survivor, as someone who had to become who she is at this point in the books to make it. She has been peeled off like an onion. Things have been taken away from her bit by bit but she will not go without a good fight. Sorry to go a bit off-topic!
2602	True Northerner	2012-05-28	I think the showed Jaquen in the preview because the Arya/Hot Pie/Gendry escape from episode 8 wasn't fully concluded. He needs to give her the coin, change his face, and give her the words.
As mentioned, Arya has no reason to leave Westeros. The whole reason she started the journey North was to go home, which is what she probably still plans to do. 
My only worry is that these long road voyages are tough to translate on screen. I mean, when I read the book, I was constantly referring to the maps, because their location at the time of certain incidents is important. It was always "she's so close!" and then BAM! tragedy.
2603	Harrad	2012-05-28	I agree with all (most?) of you that it should/will be shown. I'm still going to be amazed when/if they manage to sustain a Harry Potter-like longevity on HBO.
2604	The Maid of Mansfield	2012-05-28	I agree with all (most?) of you that it should/will be shown. I'm still going to be amazed when/if they manage to sustain a Harry Potter-like longevity on HBO.They have been able to do it with True Blood. The TV show is based on The Southern Vampire Mysteries by Charlaine Harris (which were quite altered and tweaked) and it still goes on strong!
2605	Mulled Wino	2012-05-28	Will this traveling road show be included in the series? It was the final turnaround for the  Hound in the book. The series can't include everything so maybe this will go. It looks in the previews that Arya does meet Jaquen again--she has to get the coin--but will she go directly to Bravos? That could save some time, but at the expense of the  Hounds redemption.Any more cutting of arya scense and im gonna have a problem
2606	unBloodraven	2012-05-28	They aren't in Riverrun in the TV series... I don't even recall it being mentioned in the TV version as of yet, so realistically all she knows as to location is he's somewhere in the Riverlands (where ever Tywin last heard of him being before he left Harenhall since in the TV series she was at his war council meetings)...Why would Arya go with Jaqen? As far as she knows her mother, and brothers are all around Riverrun. She's heading home and is unlikely to follow some dude she barely knows in another direction. My best guess is Arya refuses Jaqen's offer so he gives her the coin as the best way to protect he can without physically being there.
2607	Arya The Assassin	2012-05-28	Arya's travels with The Hound was one of the best parts of the book, IMO. The TV show seems to point in that direction too, so I would be surprised if they skipped the entire Arya/Hound plotline in season 3. I really enjoy watching Maisie as Arya and Rory McCann is spot on as The Hound, and it would be great to see them together.
2608	Night Gathers	2012-05-28	Jaqen will simply offer her to come with him, Arya tells him she'd like to but she can't right now. He'll give her the coin for future use.
This is how I believe it'll happen.
2609	weddylok	2012-05-28	Jaqen will simply offer her to come with him, Arya tells him she'd like to but she can't right now. He'll give her the coin for future use.This is how I believe it'll happen.I think it'll happen like this too (they better not cut her scenes with the Hound!). The scene shown in the promo probably continues with Arya saying something like "I want to, but I can't". I'm a little worried about the face change, though. If I remember correctly, Jaqen tells her she must go with him AFTER he changes his face and she asks him how he did it, but in the promo he has his current Jaqen face, and he's asking her to go with him.
2610	WetHair	2012-05-28	HBO Arya has a ton of growing to do before she heads off for her training.  She's barely even killed anyone yet.And it is a prequisite to kill someone before you grow up!  For a women this should ideally happen before they flower.

2612	Lord Godric	2012-05-28	I think they'll bounce Arya around enough so that it never gets boring.  Traveling with the Brotherhood for a while, then the Hound for a while, then ultimately to Braavos. I don't see why they'd cut that out.
2613	Caro99	2012-05-28	i'm pretty sure they have to keep arya in westeros for at least 2 more seasons. being at the twins when the RW was happening, learning where the heart is in case she wnts to give a man a gentle death and taking the hound off her list are some things that are wodnerfully great or sad to read about but that in the end just help in her development, so i'm sure they'll keep the hound & arya. and we need to see the fantastic fight between sandor and beric and all the mentioning of the pretty little bird sandor keeps bringing up

2615	The Monkey	2012-05-28	I'm really, really hoping she kills some random Lannister soldier/outlaw on the road after her departure from Jaqen, preferably in cold blood when she had the choice to just tie him up and leave him. I bet they'll skip it, but damn it's important for viewers to get a sense of Arya's beginning path to darkness.
2616	Harrad	2012-05-28	it's important for viewers to get a sense of Arya's beginning path to darkness.Don't see that. Everybody she killed had it coming. Might as well say Ned Stark's path to darkness for beheading someone without a trial. And when are they going to eliminate capital punishment in Winterfell? Its so medieval.
2617	The Monkey	2012-05-28	Don't see that. Everybody she killed had it coming. Might as well say Ned Stark's path to darkness for beheading someone without a trial. And when are they going to eliminate capital punishment in Winterfell? Its so medieval.The Bolton guard at Harrenhal only "had it coming" in the respect that he was in Arya's way. He needed to die so that she might escape, the same logic as in the scenario I suggested.

2620	Dirty Steve	2012-05-28	If there is no Arya and Hound then I am officially done watching this show. Arya is THE most entertaining POV in the series and the chapters with the hound were amazing. I love this show but I love Arya more then life itself.
2621	Reposado	2012-05-28	they've been mentioning the brotherhood way too much in harrenhal not to have arya meet them. no way she goes with jaqen
2622	Brave Danny Flint	2012-05-29	i'm pretty sure they have to keep arya in westeros for at least 2 more seasons. being at the twins when the RW was happening, learning where the heart is in case she wnts to give a man a gentle death and taking the hound off her list are some things that are wodnerfully great or sad to read about but that in the end just help in her development, so i'm sure they'll keep the hound & arya. and we need to see the fantastic fight between sandor and beric and all the mentioning of the pretty little bird sandor gives to arya.I agree the RW with Arya and the Hound, and their travels together just after, are poignant and brutal and some of the best interactions between two characters. Arya's journey through Westeros cannot happen without the Hound, it is where she hardens her heart, realises her wolf pack are lost to her and goes to a dark place. All this mirrors the Hound's own life and as he journeys with Arya, how he also realises he too is lost. The series has already cut the Hound's scenes with one Stark sister, they can't afford to do it again with another. And for what more naked scenes with pointless Dr. Volantis lady ( /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' /> ) . I really hope not. Plus the Hound's fight with the BWB is also relevant to move the plot forward.
2623	SerSquidford	2012-05-29	Arya/Hound adventures were some of my favorite scenes in all of ASOIAF; can't imagine them cutting these but it certainly would streamline S3, which is going to be a lot of frenzied cramming, really. I'm hoping all the Hound screentime/character exploration they did in Blackwater (a pleasant surprise given how backgrounded he'd been in the show) is a setup for this.

And as others have mentioned, they wouldn't have made so many references to the Brotherhood without Banners if Arya wasn't going to meet up with them next season. And she's taken Gendry who stays with the Brotherhood so it seems like they are on track.They always just edit the previews to make it difficult to guess where it's going.

And she's taken Gendry who stays with the Brotherhood so it seems like they are on track.They always just edit the previews to make it difficult to guess where it's going.I agree with the many positive comments about this story line.including every story line certainly makes us book readers happy. The only caveat is that the telewriters have to be given the time and money by HBO to get to the end without cutting. The biggest cut that I can remember so far is the Tully's and Riverrun...and it seems as if the HBO series has managed to leave that out without going seriously off-track. Is the Hound-Sansa build up preparing for the Hound-Arya payoff next season. Probably so. But the issue is, can the story resume even after a particular story line is removed. The Arya character develops considerably after she leaves the Hound, and has much more to come apparently even after ADWD.
2626	towerofjoy	2012-05-31	Most of Arya's story happens before the RW. Am wondering what thy are going to do with her in season 4? or do you guys think the RW will be season 4?

And she books passage on the ship to Braavos with the coin, which could end her story for Season 4 with more newly made content of her travels with the Hound to add to her screen time, or they could have her ship travel chapter at the end of Season 4 and haver her arrival in Braavos end her story for that season.
2628	Silverx2	2012-06-01	i better get "what kind of lady throws an apple"
2629	bikie	2012-06-01	after the success of arya and tywin, story or not, they will include large doses of her and the hound... bet on it...not only are the scenes amazing in the book, the actors have shown that they can more than deliver...
2630	The Owl	2012-05-28	My first impression upon first viewing of the episode was that Stannis was being dragged off by Lannister men in the last few shots of the episode, it was quick, and moved fast, so I could not analyze it further. This is of course a significant departure from the books as Stannis was not captured and was able to retreat....  
It was pointed out to me (elsewhere on another forum) that it was most likely his own men that we're dragging him off on top of the battlements....  I was under the impression that he was alone up there, but noticed a shot a couple of minutes earlier when one men did make their way up there to help him fight... so that conclusion seems more likely, but I honestly cannot tell from the second an a half where Stannis is being dragged off (I've re-watched it a couple of times) if it's by his own men, or Lannister men...
I know the former is more likely, but admit that it could be a departure as well... Are any of you curious about this as well?
2631	ChillinLikeSerIlyn	2012-05-29	I'd say there was no question it was his own men dragging him off.
2632	Greywolf2375	2012-05-29	yeah, his own men - otherwise he would have been fighting to get free in a much different way and most likely wouldn't have just been dragged away but beaten down a little so he didn't fight.
2633	Mediumjon Umber	2012-05-29	Yeah yeah, it was his own men. Imagine the uproar from book purists if Stannis was still in KL next week /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
2634	aimlessgun	2012-05-29	One of the men was wearing a kettle helmet, so they were definitely Stannis' men.
2635	redditdedditrevolver	2012-05-29	he's screaming "stand and fight!" - im pretty sure hes not talking to the lannisters.... but I can see how the last few moments of the episode could be really confusing to people that havent read the book
2636	Tourniquet	2012-05-29	There is no way Stannis gets captured by the Lannisters unless they are making a MAJOR departure from the books, the likes of which they have NOT yet made. Plus as GRRM was the writer of this episode it makes it doubly unlikely that he was captured.
2637	sarah.jenice	2012-05-29	I've actually seen a lot of people question this scene and are worried Stannis was captured. I definitely think it was his own men making him retreat (just like in the book). 
On another note, I thought Stannis was pretty awesome in that fight. I've gone back and forth on liking show Stannis, but he impressed me with his fighting skills. I think they needed to show that so people would root for him a little more.
2638	The Owl	2012-05-29	Thanks for the clarification, it happened quick in the episode, as I was getting slightly worried...
2639	Anvilbreaker	2012-05-30	In the books he reproaches some of his knights for forcing him to retreat, so that is probably what we are seeing here
2640	Prince of Dragonstone	2012-05-30	The Lannisters would NEVER allow for Stannis to live; book or show. The "pretender kings" were too much of a threat to the Lannisters' grasp on the Iron Throne.
2641	Ladimore	2012-05-30	I liked the episode, but was Stannis fighting on the battlements for 20 minutes?...in the same spot? 
As for the writers taking a drastic turn. I don't quite remember the warlocks killing the rulers of Qarth, or Jon Snow being such a useless twatt.
2642	Hear Us Roar	2012-05-31	it was without a doubt his own men.
2643	Direwolf Lager	2012-05-31	Yeah yeah, it was his own men. Imagine the uproar from book purists if Stannis was still in KL next weekthere would be no uproar cause that would never happen
2644	hombay	2012-05-31	It was obviously his own men. Look at the armor and helmets and compare it to the Lannister men.
2645	Paxmaniac	2012-05-31	"Come on Stannis, we have to get out of here.  Now we just climb down that 40 foot ladder, sneak past that army of 10,000 that just slaughtered all our men, find a boat, get to one of the ships that hasn't burned into the sea and sneak out of the bay before the Royal fleet catches us."
"I am Stannis the Mannis.  My skull is made of iron.  Nothing is impossible."
2646	Free Man	2012-05-31	Agreed. I wonder how they will get him to Dragonstone now?
2647	Ser Dermett Corbray	2012-05-31	Agreed. I wonder how they will get him to Dragonstone now?Maybe they'll have Salla's boats off in the distance? Stannis flees on a small rowing boat and gets picked up by one of Salla's ships, ditto Davos.
2648	MadMage	2012-06-01	"Come on Stannis, we have to get out of here.  Now we just climb down that 40 foot ladder, sneak past that army of 10,000 that just slaughtered all our men, find a boat, get to one of the ships that hasn't burned into the sea and sneak out of the bay before the Royal fleet catches us.""I am Stannis the Mannis.  My skull is made of iron.  Nothing is impossible."If they even bother to explain it, it will be the reserves came in and held off Tywin and Loras' host long enough to retrieve Stannis and cover the retreat.
2649	Sarnius	2012-05-28	wow Varys wasn't even the main focus of this episode yet he owned the screen in the little screen time he had. That little tear he had in the corner of his eye while keeping his 24/7 expression of neutrality...wow.
Conleth Hill is amazing as Varys, they could not find anyone better.
I actually think the TV Varys is better than the book one, not only does he emit an aura of femininity, he is also eschew a subtle menace. He hads more to the character, little things that make him more interesting.
2650	SerMixalot	2012-05-28	Am I the only one thinking he was tryng to recruit Tyion to the targaryen cause?
2651	Zappotack	2012-05-28	I keep feeling there were hints of that this and the previous episode talking about Dany
2652	Umberto	2012-05-28	Why have they included so many lines of dialog indicating that Varys likes little boys...
And they were not referring to those boys being his spies.
2653	Reposado	2012-05-28	Why have they included so many lines of dialog indicating that Varys likes little boys...And they were not referring to those boys being his spies.thought the same. i don't feel like that was implied by the books at all.
2654	Qwop22	2012-05-28	Yea I was a little confused as to what Varys was trying to get at with Tyrion in that scene. Was he trying to tell him about Dany and to join her cause? Why was he going to tell Tyrion about when he was cut? If i remember correctly Varys was cut for some magical ritual, but what about it? Was that just to make Tyrion recognize magic?
2655	Bronn Stone	2012-05-28	It is my impression from the show that there is a dynamic not observed in the books.  Varys is believed to dally with young boys.  It may be that society has gotten hints of his little birds but misunderstood his reasons for having them around.  We do know from the novels that he goes through them with alacrity.  It isn't too great a leap to imagine that there are whispers about the boys and misunderstanding of his purpose.
2656	Died a Hero	2012-05-28	Yea I was a little confused as to what Varys was trying to get at with Tyrion in that scene. Was he trying to tell him about Dany and to join her cause? Why was he going to tell Tyrion about when he was cut? If i remember correctly Varys was cut for some magical ritual, but what about it? Was that just to make Tyrion recognize magic?Yes. In the book he explains that his manhood was sacrificed for a magic ritual in which he (Varys) heard a language spoken that had never been heard by another man before. He hates blood/black magic, and hates Stannis for using blood magic to gain his army and kill his little brother. He was trying to impress on Tyrion the stakes he was fighting for.
2657	Tourniquet	2012-05-29	I think that the mentioning of Varys and little boys is due to the confusion associated with the motives of a Eunuch. Cersei and other constantly mention that he is hard to predict and thus dangerous because he doesn't have the desires of a "normal" man.
2658	boojam	2012-05-29	It is my impression from the show that there is a dynamic not observed in the books.  Varys is believed to dally with young boys.

It isn't too great a leap to imagine that there are whispers about the boys and misunderstanding of his purpose.George has keep all this stuff about Varys very mysterious. In the Wiki says he hates magic but I can't remember if that is 'black' (blood) magic and leaves alone 'white'. He seems decidedly against blood magic.He seems to like relaying info about the Targaryens Dany many times, Aegon , if Aegon really exists.And is all this tied with Illyrio - Varys conspiracy? Especially when Illyrio seems to be trying help Daenerys?All the frothing R'hllor vs God whose name should not be spoken... who seems to be The Great Other...those two in concert seem to be the major magic players in Martin World.I don't know how GRRM is going to explain all this in two novels!
2659	Cressit	2012-05-29	Am I the only one thinking he was tryng to recruit Tyion to the targaryen cause?I really only felt his deep antipathy towards Stannis because of the dark magic that Mel is using to help him. I didn't pick up on any Targ allusions.What part of the conversation felt that way to you?
2660	SerMixalot	2012-05-30	Yea I was a little confused as to what Varys was trying to get at with Tyrion in that scene. Was he trying to tell him about Dany and to join her cause? Why was he going to tell Tyrion about when he was cut? If i remember correctly Varys was cut for some magical ritual, but what about it? Was that just to make Tyrion recognize magic?I think Varys is trying to get tyrion to believe in magic, ie dragons to woo him to his cause.  Certainly makes sense for Varys (helps to further divide the Lannisters) and well written, the subtle bit of info, should get more of that next season.
2661	SerMixalot	2012-05-30	It is my impression from the show that there is a dynamic not observed in the books.  Varys is believed to dally with young boys.

It isn't too great a leap to imagine that there are whispers about the boys and misunderstanding of his purpose.But IIRC Varys was cut root and stem, so one wonders and yes it bothers me that I wonder such things!
2662	SerMixalot	2012-05-30	I really only felt his deep antipathy towards Stannis because of the dark magic that Mel is using to help him. I didn't pick up on any Targ allusions.What part of the conversation felt that way to you?For me it was in combination with last weeks discussion about dany's dragons and knowledge that Varys is a secret Targaryen supporter. Why bring Dany up at that point, why bring up dark magic. This is Varys we are talking about who has an agenda for every word that he utters. Also the comments on trust, indicating that Tyrion should keep an open mind on the subject
2663	mcb	2012-05-30	Why have they included so many lines of dialog indicating that Varys likes little boys...Do they? I remember (from this episode) only one line, Tyrion saying "as if you didn't know the name of every boy in King's Landing". In context of Pod, who looks to be in his late teens/early twenties, not a little boy by any measure.
2664	Roxane De	2012-05-31	I also felt the Varys/Tyrion conversations as an attempt of Varys to "test" Tyrion in case he could turn his cloak and serve Dany's cause.
That said, I still have something bugging me :
If Varys is against magic, why is he a Targaryen supporter since the dragons are closely related to magic?

2666	Apoapsis	2012-05-28	Was it Renly's? I couldn't tell, but since no one made a point of it I suppose it wasn't. Also, there wouldn't be much need for it as a morale-booster in the TV version of the battle since they basically just rode in and slaughtered everyone in a couple of minutes.
2667	Bambi	2012-05-28	I rewatched this part a few minutes ago since someone mentioned the armor as it were Renly's... it can be, but Loras's cloak hides the most of it. But yeah, not so important, most of the soldiers seem to be Lannisters and city guards as I see.
2668	Bourne	2012-05-28	I hope it wasn't. Garlan is so much more badass than Loras and it would be a pity if they got rid of him.
2669	Crown	2012-05-28	I think it was Renly's helmet (the one with the antlers) Loras was wearing.
2670	Ran	2012-05-28	It was indeed Renly's. The HBO Go interactive notes features it. As Loras also fought famously at the Blackwater, second only to his brother Ser Garlan, I don't see the issue. The Knight of Flowers is indeed one of the badass warriors of the Seven Kingdoms, as Martin's taken care to note more than once.
2671	LÂ<U+0092>Age dÂ<U+0092>or	2012-05-28	His armor looked like a combination of Renly's and Brienne's armor, the helmet is surely the Rainbow Guard style helmet that Brienne put on but his armor is Renly'shttp://i1091.photobu...en/0c0cad08.pnghttp://i373.photobuc...ash21/Renly.jpg
2672	Mediumjon Umber	2012-05-28	Slightly offtopic, but Loras walking into the throne room wearing that armor was yet another badass moment in the episode.
2673	Harrad	2012-05-28	Right. As someone pointed out Renley's ghost could be thought as an "easter egg" for book readers. Still it could have been emphasized without too much trouble and a bit different editing.
2674	Monk Meth-	2012-05-28	he had the helmet.. i think they axed garlan.. he hasn't done much in the book and paying an actor to play him would be pointless.
2675	Ser Hippie	2012-05-28	In the books, Garlan wears the armor because he's closer to Renly's size than Loras, who wouldn't be able to pull it off. In the show that's not the case, so they can have Loras wear it (which I think is more dramatically satisfying anyway).
2676	Lord Godric	2012-05-28	I've only watched the episode once, so I don't remember everything, when do we see Loras fighting like that? I imagine it is in the confusion surrounding Tyrion getting wounded, but I don't remember it.
2677	Ran	2012-05-28	It's after Tyrion gets his head almost split, and he's in a daze while Cersei's story is in VO. Tyrion sees a group of horsemen charging, a knight in Renly's armor riding a white horse in the forefront, and then from there on there are several shots. Tyrion's last vision before he goes unconscious is Loras killing someone or other.
2678	Natmus	2012-05-28	It was indeed Renly's. The HBO Go interactive notes features it. As Loras also fought famously at the Blackwater, second only to his brother Ser Garlan, I don't see the issue. The Knight of Flowers is indeed one of the badass warriors of the Seven Kingdoms, as Martin's taken care to note more than once.I think issue here is if it makes any sense within the show that Loras wears Renly's armour at all? In the books, Renly's armour had three uses.Firstly, it made the common people think that it was Renly himself, very much alive, that had come to save Kings Landing from Stannis. When Dontos presents Sansa with these news, the reader makes a mental exclamation point, as the reader has seen Renly being slain half a book earlier. I remember my own confusion over this many years ago.Secondly, as Renly is firmly dead, it gives birth to the legend of Renly's Ghost, which is a great part in the public reconciliation of the Baratheon, Tyrell and Lannister factions.Thirdly, the discussion about who actually wore the armour gives a lead-in to Garlan Tyrell.The first point seemed to be ignored in the show, as Dontos and Sansa's interaction has been kept to an absolute minimum. The legend of Renly's Ghost may still float, but as Loras gave it away in public, I doubt very much it will become a common myth. Thirdly, if Garlan has been saved away, there is no need to give him a lead-in.So, in conclusion, to me Loras wearing the armour is rather meaningless. At most a nod to the source material about what could have been, but nothing more than a superficial gesture.

2679	Ran	2012-05-28	I expect George put it in there as a gesture to it, in fact, and with the added spin that it was sort of Loras's way to honor Renly. And it may be that in the next episode we'll hear that some of Stannis's men threw down their swords rather than fight against "Renly", I suppose, but really, it doesn't much matter. Small detail.
2680	mcb	2012-05-28	I think issue here is if it makes any sense within the show that Loras wears Renly's armour at all? To scare the shit out of Stannis' soldiers. For a few moments, and if very lucky, for the duration of the battle. Really no reason to try very hard to keep it secret afterwards, as there's no need to maintain a legend of Renly's ghost. Since the Tyrells and the Lannisters now sing the same song: all hail King Joffrey, it would be politically awkward to support a legend of Renly, who did try to snatch the throne from under Joff's ass.Also, it was personal for Loras.
2681	CrownedStag	2012-05-29	Slightly offtopic, but Loras walking into the throne room wearing that armor was yet another badass moment in the episode.Totally badass
2682	Agalloch	2012-05-29	So someone help me get this straight as Im only halfway through acok.  Since stannis killed rely more or less, loras vowed revenge.  But loras supported renlys claim that joff wasn't the rightful heir.  So he joined up with tywin to get that revenge.  however tywin is a lannister, and supports joffs claim to the throne.  So wouldn't that make loras' allegiance fairly conflicting?
2683	Brucolac	2012-05-29	You'll find out next week on the show or if you hurry up, you can figure it out in the books.  There was foreshadowing for the alliance in the TV series in the episode we last saw Loras.
2684	SerRodzilla	2012-05-29	So someone help me get this straight as Im only halfway through acok.  Since stannis killed rely more or less, loras vowed revenge.  But loras supported renlys claim that joff wasn't the rightful heir.  So he joined up with tywin to get that revenge.  however tywin is a lannister, and supports joffs claim to the throne.  So wouldn't that make loras' allegiance fairly conflicting?As we havent had a Tyrell POV in the book's we can't be 100% sure of Loras' inner belief's, I always thought of it as Renly could have been spurting whatever shit he wanted to Loras would have supported him because he loved him, If Renly would have claimed he was King of the North, Loras would proberly have backed his claim.In this instance he is going for the Iorn Throne, Loras in the show (can't remember in the books) convinced Renly that he could be King because he is loved by the small folk who would rather him than Stannis. The Tyrell's sensing this pretty much back Renly as they have one of the largest army's, after Renly's death they are weekend by some of the houses joining Stannis.The Tyrell's know that they cannot join forces with Stannis so they take the next best thing after Renly, The Lannisters. There is some more political wrangling (but I dont want to ruin that for you).So the Tyrell's pretty much are not fussed about what is right or wrong the rightful heir or the pretender, for them it's a massive power play, but the Lannister's are not stupid either so both side's dont entirley trust each other but they need each other.
2685	victim	2012-05-29	Loras basically convinced Renly to claim himself a King in the first place. I think it goes a little deeper than the Tyrell's using Renly in this case, though that's basically what it is. Much like the Lannister's did in Robert's Rebellion, the Tyrell's pick whichever side is going to win.
2686	Greywolf2375	2012-05-29	I expect George put it in there as a gesture to it, in fact, and with the added spin that it was sort of Loras's way to honor Renly. And it may be that in the next episode we'll hear that some of Stannis's men threw down their swords rather than fight against "Renly", I suppose, but really, it doesn't much matter. Small detail.Agreed - I think we will get some brief dialogues about what happened outside the walls, how Tywin ended up in the throne room with the Tyrells at his back.If Garlan does not exist in this version, that may have an interesting impact on the PW to come given what many theorize he does.
2687	TeamDanyArya	2012-05-29	I never thought of Loras wearing Renly's armor as a way to scare the crap out of Stannis or at the very least, his men. I don't remember that from the book although I can see that making complete sense. Stannis has taken up with the black arts so seeing his brother's armor could spook him. 
I know the helm had to be Renly's or at least representating the Rainbow Guard thereby honoring Renly.
Next season will be very interesting...
2688	Ser Hippie	2012-05-29	It scares a lot of Stannis' men in the books because they're uneducated and superstitious peasants who are spooked by seeing the dead Renly coming at them.
I was reminded of this topic when I saw an exchange on another site where someone complained about this part of the episode because Loras was wearing the armor and he was under the impression Renly's ghost was actually in the armor in the books /bawl.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bawl:' />
2689	Harrad	2012-05-30	Some murmuring among Stannis' troops "It's Renly's ghost" would have sealed that deal. Instead it was left as an easter egg for book readers with no real hope that non-book readers would get it.
2690	ambi76	2012-05-30	The problem is not so much that non-book readers wouldn't recognize the armor or what it means. That was indeed an easter egg and us Loras fans are very happy about it. But  aprox. 66%+ of non-book readers don't even seem to have the faintest idea who Loras is. And most of those still seem to think Loras and Lancel are the same character. /dunno.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':dunno:' />
Well, the finale will hopefully clear up all that a bit. Then again, on my journey through different online boards I even met folks who didn't know who Tywin is ("From what house is the old dude again?") and at that piont you just want to give up. /bang.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bang:' />

2691	Catherine Storm	2012-05-30	The only way you could tell it was Renly's was the antlers, which I missed on the first viewing but looked out for it in the 2nd. My non- reader friend watched it before i did and I'd asked if he saw Renly's ghost, but he had no idea what I was on about. I guess as the above posters said, it was just a subtle treat from GRRM. 
I still just don't understand why the Baratheon brothers couldn't just reach an agreement and take over KL together!!! Ughhh (but that's another story for another thread).
2692	Parise	2012-05-30	The problem is not so much that non-book readers wouldn't recognize the armor or what it means. That was indeed an easter egg and us Loras fans are very happy about it.

They can't have been paying enough attention.
2693	Istari	2012-05-30	Loras was in Renly's armour
Its a shame that they didn't emphasize this a little bit more. I remember, prior to S.2 being aired, my friends and I were guessing what sort of 'tricks' HBO would play on the non-readers (by tricks I mean plot twists that would work as cliff hangers)
We all agreed that Renly's ghost would be one of the 'cliff hangers'(for lack of a better word). But we soon realized - once the season started and his distinctive armour wasn't emphasized - Renly's ghost wouldn't make the cut.
Granted, if you watch closely, the helm has antlers....but still, how the hell would a non reader make that distinction? (my guess is that it was to appease the book readers)
Its a shame that it wasn't included. I think HBO missed an opportunity here to stir up some drama for the non readers.
To be fair though, it was a pretty dramatic episode as is
Perhaps, in Valar Morghulis, there will be some sort of dialogue to explain the situation. Though it won't have the same effect as it would have in 'real time'

2695	sharkhawk	2012-05-30	I don't think that the show deviates as much from the books on why Renly declared himself King as a lot of people think.  Although it isn't explained in the books, we know that the Queen of thorns wanted power for the Tyrell family, and what better way to get it than to have Margery marry her brothers boyfriend?  Renly didn't strike me as being the brightest bulb, not very interested in the Throne, but more like Robert.  The Lannisters were the power behind Robert, why not the Tyrells being the power behind Renly.
2696	TeamDanyArya	2012-05-30	Interesting point and makes sense for the Renly-Margarey match. I really didn't give the Tyrells much credit in my initial reading of the books. I guess because they aren't as out there as the Lannisters are. Their power moves are much more subtle.
2697	Maia	2012-06-01	Didn't like how the show pussified Lancel during the Battle of the Blackwater, frankly. The funny thing about Lancel is that he is a true Lannister in a sense that he is physically brave and while not a great fighter, like Jaime or good general like Tywin already were at his age, he actually performed very well as a knight and an officer during this battle, leading several successful sorties, continuing to fight while wounded, IIRC, and coming to the Red Keep to protest Joff's removal from the walls.
2698	Lors' Edrick	2012-05-30	So with the conclusion of the 'Battle of Blackwater Bay'; does the feeling of epicness seem a little, non-epic?I have listed a few of my likes and dislikes, feel free to comment or add your own. EPICthe burning of Stannis' fleet by wildfirethe closeness of King's Landing falling to StannisCersei and Sansa's conversations in the Holdfastthe charge of Kings Landers with Tyrion leading the chargeMandon Moore turning on Tyrion, and his rescue by Podrickthe counter-attack by both Stannis' forces and then in-turn by the Tyrell-Lannister forcesNON-EPICthe feeling that Stannis was attacking King's landing with  2-3000 soldiers, and the defenders were about 500the size of both fleets were grossly undersizedwhere is Salladhor Saan?the gates of King's Landing were not very largethe some what small scale of the grandness of the battlefieldAnd before it gets out of hand, I know there is budget restrictions, but still, please be honest and open with your opinions.
2699	Tourniquet	2012-05-30	No chain and "Mouth of Hell" as Davos described it...
2700	wolverine	2012-05-30	Also, seemed like the whole battle took about 20 minutes.
EDIT:  Predictable, but Tyrion's weak scar sucks too.

2701	JoramunsKazoo	2012-05-30	EPIC:
Stannis 2.0
NOT EPIC:
I was hoping for more wildfire and/or a more drawn out naval battle.  The "dirty bomb" was pretty awesome and a pleasing replacement for the "chain", but I really wanted to see some more of the wildfire saved for catapulting on the remaining ships.  I recall a few soldiers coming to shore ablaze from waves of fire arrows, but I think wildfire would've brought the point home.  Especially for selling us on the traumatic effect it had on Clegane.
2702	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-30	No chain and "Mouth of Hell" as Davos described it...I think he was a bit busy getting blasted off Black Betha in the blaze of a rampant green inferno to describe much of anything. Which in itself was fairly epic...

2703	mcb	2012-05-30	NON-EPICthe feeling that Stannis was attacking King's landing with  2-3000 soldiers, and the defenders were about 500the size of both fleets were grossly undersizedWell, it was at night (dark and full of terrors, ofc.), so it's only fair that we haven't seen the entire picture, just a snippet here and there. And as for the fleets: the Royal Lannister Fleet is simply absent in this version of the battle, and as for the Royal Baratheon Fleet, at no point we see the whole shebang. But Stannis' reinforcements keep coming from somewhere.the gates of King's Landing were not very largeNot the gates, plural. One of them, called Mud Gate, which doesn't suggest enormous splendor. It's been explicitly said that that was the point where the defenses were weakest. So yes, It's OK if it looked less than impressive.What was really annoying, however, is unrelated to any budgetary constraints. Stannis, you moron, put a helmet on, will you?! His bare head was more irritating that all deviations from the original story.

2704	NomadicDirewolf	2012-05-30	the size of both fleets were grossly undersizedto be fair joffreys fleet wasnt even shown, so you cant really make a judgement on it, plus i dont know about you but i do not recall ever seeing an end to stannis fleet, so its just as big if not bigger than in the books  the gates of King's Landing were not very largenow thats what i call extreme nitpickingthe some what small scale of the grandness of the battlefieldnot only did that save them a lot of money, but to me it felt like the style of the books, close in, violent, and the whilst characters are fighting we barely have any knowledge of how the battle itself is shaping up, we get it mostly from the walls, which was something GRRM aimed for and wandering ewok:Also, seemed like the whole battle took about 20 minutes.to me that didnt feel like it was the case, to me it definetly felt like it lasted the entire night or close to thatthey had little budget on this, everything about the battle exceeded my expectations. One episode was more than enough, and they could hardly give any more
2705	Reposado	2012-05-30	to me any element of non-epicness comes down to preserving the point of view. we don't get a sweeping overview of a battle, we get a series of very personal looks at a battle that is happening in several locations. (the mudgate, wherever the bulk of stannis men ended up being unloaded before they made their way to the mudgate
2706	BlackTalon	2012-05-30	Epic, maybe not really.
But they did all they could do, I can accept that and have no problems with it whatsoever, even as a bit of a "purist".
I still think the explosion was better than the chain could have been. Not in terms of sheer scale, but in visual impressiveness.

2707	Ser Hippie	2012-05-30	I don't get why Salladhor Saan keeps being brought up when he plays no role in the battle in the books either, as he's in the rear. He adds some flavor to Stannis' forces on the show, helps explain where Stannis gets so many ships, and presumably will keep his minor role in the post-Blackwater Davos storyline.
There's also a nitpick thread where a lot of this stuff probably belongs but eh

2709	Rayn	2012-05-30	I think a landscape shot showing the scope would have made this episode so much better, the vastness of battle just seems lost when all we see is the same backdrop over and over. Also some cavalry woulda been nice seeing as how Westeros is kinda big on you know...knights. One of my biggest nitpicks about the show is how every single soldier seems to own a full set of armor, there is no deviation between knights and men-at-arms.
2710	Ser Hippie	2012-05-30	because in the show, which needs to stand on its own, its unexplained why he plays no part in the battle when the show made a point of him being persuaded to take partThe point is made that they need his ships, which is why they had to persuade him, and they got their ships. Is it really that important to show a shot of him to confirm what we already know (that his ships are indeed at Blackwater?If they go by the books (and there's no reason not to), it's something that can be easily included when he rescues Davos or during a later conversation. Throwing him into the episode for him to say "Gee, guys, I wish we weren't in the rear echelon and could take part in the battle" is a waste of time, especially given how much they had to cram in already.The only reason to include him is if he was going to do something concrete or substantial in the episode. Showing him for the sake of showing him (i.e. the "look, here's Salladhor doing nothing!") when he's going to have something substantive to do next week that explains what happened is unnecessary.

2712	LiamBridge	2012-05-30	Being a TV show I thought it was an amazing battle. It didint have the same scale as say Lord of the rings, but for TV it was great.
One thing that was a bit of a let down was the wild fire, it was good but it seemed like it was over in about 30 seconds, unlike in the book where it was raging the whole battle. I know that it would't really work to have fighting on the burning ships, but still just showing a shot of the ship on fire in the background or something might have been nice.
2713	Ser Hippie	2012-05-30	they didn't need to show him this week. the dropped plotline is the fault of previous episodes. iv'e said this in other threads, but they needed  ascene where davos tells saan that he will be in the back and saan can pissed about the lack of plunder, queen etc.Why did they need that scene? Salladhor isn't a dropped plotline, he's a memorable character but he's also a minor one whose main importance is to play off of Davos after the battle. People want to see Salladhor, because he seems fun/funny in the show, but seeing as this topic is about the battle as portrayed this episode, I don't know why they though it was necessary here. They probably could have fit it into the slog that was last episode but it's not a big loss either way.otherwise the previous scenes with saan were pretty much worthless.Over-dramatic much? Even beyond the fact that not every scene has to have some major payoff later in the show, it's easily something that can be touched on after the battle.it doesn't matter that stannis has his ships because it hasn't been established how many ships stannis has, and in any case the amount they show in this episode wasn't very many.What does this even mean? The purpose of including Salladhor earlier this season was to show Stannis gathering forces for the battle (which was clear) and to introduce him before the battle so when one of his galleys rescues Davos and so we know why he and Davos are friendly on Dragonstone.The fact that Salladhor was left in the rear is not meaningful unless you pretend his later involvement doesn't exist and think that's the only way to "justify" the earlier scene (which is not about showing a valuable or important character regardless). Even in the books, Salladhor being assigned to the rear is mentioned in all of one sentence of Davos thinking about how Imry Florent doesn't trust him because he complains about not being paid.Simply put, they might have put in a line about Salladhor being assigned to the rear in a previous episode but it wasn't important in the books w/regards to the actual battle (only to explaining how his ships were able to rescue survivors including Davos) and it certainly wasn't meaningful to the Blackwater episode itself.

2714	Paxmaniac	2012-05-30	the feeling that Stannis was attacking King's landing with  2-300 soldiers, and the defenders were about 50FYP.  Realistically, they did extremely well considering the budget, but it really did feel like a handful of players on a very small set.The whole Stannis-the-hero thing was just a little silly.  No commander, no matter how brave or heroic, is the first to climb a siege ladder.  The end was just absurd - Tywin swans in with thousands of troops routing the siegers in a matter of minutes and Stannis - who is still on the battlements is somehow dragged away my his bannermen, gets back down  a ladder, finds a landing boat, gets back to a ship that is still intact and makes it out of Blackwater Bay with enough of an army to crush a hundred thousands wildlings.
2715	wolverine	2012-05-30	No one else thought it was a little less epic by how it felt like the show was twice as long as the actual battle?
2716	Reposado	2012-05-30	No one else thought it was a little less epic by how it felt like the show was twice as long as the actual battle?kinda thought that made it more epic, allowing the tension to buildWhy did they need that scene?

2717	The Original	2012-05-31	they didn't need to show him this week. Then why on earth are you complaining after this week's episode?If they drop Salladhor Saan altogether, then you can complain.  If you already acknowledged that they don't need to waste time in an already packed hour to show Salladhor in the back of the fleet going, "Gee I wish I was fucking the Queen right now", then complaining that they haven't shown him is simply being irrational and borderline asinine.The show writers didn't "drop the ball" with Salladhor Saan not being shown at the battle, because Salladhor Saan wasn't actively involved in the battle.  Is the show supposed to show every single character that wasn't there just to prove to you that they aren't dead?
2718	Hear Us Roar	2012-05-31	The attack on Tyrion was lame. Yo mean to tell me he swung but all he got was a small cut on his face? That was enough to K.O him?
I am fine with them not showing Salladhor, he will get a lot of time back at dragonstone.
2719	KC_Accidental	2012-05-31	I was bothered that Tyrion's slash looked much like a graze and his life didn't look like it was in danger as a result. Just another suspense filled cliffhanger they got totally wrong. I don't care about his damn nose, just make it look like he could be dead!
2720	mcb	2012-05-31	ok they don't need that scene. not every scene needs to be important.....unelss they want to make a great show. if they want to make a good, decent show, then no it's not necessary.Step 1: include a scene with Salla in Ep09. Step 2: ????? Step 3: profit great show.Stannis had a lot of ships, and the camera was aboard only one of them. Non-readers are perfectly capable of deducting on their own that all the other ships had crews and captains, too.
2721	FloredaA—	2012-05-31	While the episode was overall great, there were a few things that stretched belief for me, or could have been better :
-  not enough defenses : Tyrion guessed the attack would be on the Mud gate, yet there was no defenses on the beach. I'd have put some wildfire pots half buried at the edge of the water, that would get trampled by the landing soldiers...  Pits and pikes are more basic things he'd have found in his books. Granted Stannis' troups did not land where they intended to, yet they had to approch the walls before putting ladders up.
The usual defense against ladders were arrowslits in the wall themselves, allowing to shoot at the climbers though I can buy that for a reason or another (dragons?) there are none in Westeros
- Unprobable Fire : Shoot flame arrows on men dressed in (half wet) leather, and they take flame immediatley ? yeah right. Same with the boat used to protect the ram : one torch on hard wet wood and it goes up in flames like a ball of straw ? Overall while the wildfire explosion and fleet destruction was satisfyingly spectacular, the fire on land was neither really explained (even flame arrows have to find something combustible) and yet not enough to scare the Hound IMO. If not wildfire (that Bronn and Tyrion thought too dangerous to use in the castle), oil or pitch or something would have been handy.
- Stannis leading the climb : the first man on the ladder is so obviously a dead one that I expect they had to draw lots to choose him. While the king could and would lead an attack (with a good guard around him), here's the limit IMO. The lack of helmet is stupid too but more of a TV convention.
- Horses : I understand the complexities and costs to work with horses, especially in battles, but at times it becomes ridiculous : here are knights (in french chevaliers, almost literaly horsemen), whose whole point is that they fight on horses : that makes them able to bear armours that would be very impractical to walk with, not to mention fight, they are supposed to have horses aplenty in the castle stables, and yet they attack a party of footmen who are superior in numbers, and don't think of taking their horses ? If tyou want to fight on foot, send footmen. Knights without horses are in fact nearly useless (Azincourt, CrA©cy...)
- Tyrion's speech : the soldiers' crowd reaction was unbelievable, as much as when they seem to loose faith (they don't look desperate or afraid or ready to flee, more like : oh well, not funny anymore, hey buddy, what if we dropped that battle and went to have a pint and a game of cards?) and then their sudden enthusiasm totally fake.
- one very small detail : unless I'm wrong, I've yet to see a crossbow in Westeros. A battle scene would have been the ocasion to show they do exist. After all, one will feature in some future season.  
However, the whole thing worked much better than I hoped, especially considering we had been described something ten times larger (more ships, more fire, more soldiers, more confusion) that was entirely impossible to recreate.

Knights without horses are in fact nearly useless (Azincourt, CrA©cy...)This could be explained by the fact that they don't want the horses to be spooked by the fire on the beach though in reality its much for the same reason there were no horses in the riot scene: Horses spook really easily and its really unsafe to use them in crowd scenes with lots of movement and noise.- one very small detail : unless I'm wrong, I've yet to see a crossbow in Westeros. A battle scene would have been the ocasion to show they do exist. After all, one will feature in some future season.  Joff has his easy to reload one. Yoren gets shot with one and there's been a fair few Lannister soldiers carrying ones in Harrenhall.
2726	sarah.jenice	2012-05-31	OP, thanks for this new topic to voice likes and dislikes of the episode!I loved the episode so much, and while I did notice most of the things that have been brought up, Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve been trying to forgive the show because I am sure the majority of them had to do with budget/time constraints. And talking to all of my friends who have never read the books, they all loved the episode, (many saying it was the best yet) and they honestly donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t even notice the small stuff we avid book readers pick up on. I really think they are making an outstanding show that tells the heart of the story I love, and I canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t wait for the finale and the next seasons!Epic:1. Varys and Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s scene â<U+0080><U+0093> We havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t seen much of Varys this season, and this scene was one of my favorites. His words about the tolling of the bells were haunting. No one has really addressed Melâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dark powers, and this had to have many fans wondering what will happen if Stannis wins with Mel by his side. I also loved his allusion to the story of his being cut and utter hatred of magic. I canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t wait to see him tell Tyrion his story.2. Sansa and Cersei scenes â<U+0080><U+0093> They knocked these out of the park!3. Everything with Tyrion â<U+0080><U+0093> From his funny dismissal of Joffrey at the beginning of the battle to his speech to inspire the troops, Tyrion was incredible this episode (as he has been all year). I do agree that his scene with Ser Mandon turning on him was confusing and poorly executed. My fiancA© had to get me to clarify what just happened, and they made the cut look very much like it sliced his head through (Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen several people reference the way Selene kills Victor in Underworld in online blogs).4. Wildfire explosion â<U+0080><U+0093> Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve been wondering about the chain for weeks, but I like this decision. It was visually stunning, gave you a feel of the utter devastation of most of Stannis fleet, and then really brought the horror home with the cuts between the chaos on the ships and the reactions of Tyrion, Joff and the Hound. And you were still able to understand that some of Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099>s fleet was okay with the cut to him still kicking on a ship.5. Battle scenes â<U+0080><U+0093> The battle was brutal and those were some of the craziest kills on the show. I loved it!6. Bronn â<U+0080><U+0093> Singing, shooting arrows and even saving the Hound7. The Hound â<U+0080><U+0093> His â<U+0080><U+009C>F the kingâ<U+0080><U+009D> to Joff had me laughing uncontrollably, and I really liked his tended moment with Sansa. I do think that scene was confusing to TV-only viewers because they canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t understand why Sansa would have refused such a sweet deal to get to Winterfell with such a strong knight to protect her. They even had me wondering if they might have her go with him and eliminate Dontos (only for a moment because I know that wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have worked).8. Rains of Castamere â<U+0080><U+0093> I watch with my mom and fiancA© who both havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t read the books, and they both looked at me crazy when I started jumping up and down going, â<U+0080><U+009C>Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the Rains of Castamere!!â<U+0080><U+009D>My thoughts on a few of the negatives brought up and a couple of my own:1. Stannis being first up the ladder and over the wall â<U+0080><U+0093> Yes, I agree that this is an unlikely way for a commander to act, but I think the show may have done it to give show Stannis some likeable quality so fans will root for him. So far this season, I havenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t really liked show Stannis, and as we all know, he is the only one of the five kings still currently standing come TWoW, and I think his bravery and battle skill shown in Blackwater will show TV-only fans that his is a qualified and worthy contender for the Iron Throne. I thought it was a step in the right direction on Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099>s portrayal because my non-reader friends have hated him until they saw how badass he is. I especially like him hanging over the prow of the rowboat like he couldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t wait for his chance to jump into action.2. Stannis's exit - I did think this was confusing as I've seen people who even think he was captured by the Lannisters. I guess once we all see him safe at Dragonstone, they will better explain how exactly he got off the wall into a rowboat and back to a ship with Tywin and Tyrell armies all around.3. Lack of horses â<U+0080><U+0093> Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve noticed this all season (not just in the battle, but Robb and Talisa walking to the Crag, too), and Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen where the producers said theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve had trouble getting horses, but The Borgias on Showtime has tons of horses in each episode (maybe theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve taken them all â<U+0080><U+0093> Showtime, let HBO borrow some horses please). It does make things less believable, but I think they carried out the battle on foot really well.4. Lack of Salladhor â<U+0080><U+0093> Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve been missing Salla, too, but I have to agree with the posters who were not bothered with his absence here because it could be explained later. I was mainly upset that they left out his story of AA to Davos after Stannis gets Lightbringer. Maybe they thought it was too early to go into heavy mythology and are saving it for next season, and I could understand if that is when they want to utilize his character (other than having him say funny, but overall pointless lines about wanting to rape Cersei). Since the beginning of Stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Storm of Swords chapters deal with him regrouping and the prophecy and what Mel thinks he should do (leech burning, kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s blood, numerous speeches on him being the chosen one), I could see them holding off going into the AA legend until then, but I would be really disappointed if it is fully removed from the show. Iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve got so many theories based on what Salla tells Davos, and I donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want all that thinking to be for nothing!5. Small scale of the battle â<U+0080><U+0093> I agree that at least one sweeping shot that showed the full scale of the battle would have been nice (all of the ships or troops), but I think that they made up for it by orienting the action around characters we cared about. Instead of seeing a bunch of random guys killing each other, we got to see characters we know in the heat of battle, and a lot of TV-only viewers were certain they were in mortal danger, which is exactly what the show was aiming for.6. What the battle change will mean for Davos's storyline - Since the wildfire bomb ship knocked Davos out of the picture so quickly, do you all still think he will blame Mel for the loss of the battle and his son (thanks to fire)? I know that will only affect his early Storm/Season 3 storyline, but I've been wondering if they will still go forward with that. I liked his interaction with Mel when he is arrested because it gives more insight on her powers, and I would be a little let down if the cut/change that. Another gripe along those lines is that we've barely gotten to know Davos (or Stannis for that matter) to really care about their fates on the show. I really hope they can find a way to give them more screen time so the audience will better understand who they are and why we should care about their fates.(Sorry for the long post, but this is the first time I've voiced all of my comments on the episode) /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
2727	Ser Dermett Corbray	2012-05-31	I reckon Salla's fleet will be further back. A switch from the book sure, but they could have him pick up a fleeing Stannis and a washed-up Davos.
The wildfire explosion still has my jaw hitting the ground. Beautifully terrifying.
If anyone disagrees with me, I'll rape your fucking corpse (I loved The Hound in battle mode /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />)
The bells and the drums were amazing.
The Rains of Castamere made me so so so happy.

2728	mcb	2012-05-31	2. Stannis's exit - I did think this was confusing as I've seen people who even think he was captured by the Lannisters. I guess once we all see him safe at Dragonstone, they will better explain how exactly he got off the wall into a rowboat and back to a ship with Tywin and Tyrell armies all around.If he had been, indeed, captured by the Lannisters, the scene would look anything but confusing. Stannis wouldn't still have his sword, for one.
2729	the maester	2012-05-29	I haven't seen the episode yet, so don't want to read all the post.
I find I enjoy the episodes more if I'm aware that key plot elements have been dropped.
So, does Tyrion's chain make an appearance or not?
2730	imbs	2012-05-29	nope fraid not
2731	BlackTalon	2012-05-29	I didnÂ´t really miss it either. And this doesnÂ´t have anything to do with the fact that this episode was written by Martin himself. SOME changes really do work.
2732	Greywolf2375	2012-05-29	I didnÂ´t really miss it either. And this doesnÂ´t have anything to do with the fact that this episode was written by Martin himself. SOME changes really do work.Some do, some don't.The only chain we did see was what Tyrion was wearing.  For the way they did the scenes, wasn't needed and wouldn't really have worked - spose if they REALLY want to cram it in they could somehow say in the next episode that they had it as a back up or something, but that would be pointless.   Battle worked well the way they did it (with one flaw IMO).
2733	Reposado	2012-05-29	using the chain would have forced them to enhance the scope of the naval battle greatly. what they did worked and got to the dramatically good stuff quickly
2734	kungtotte	2012-05-29	I didnÂ´t really miss it either. And this doesnÂ´t have anything to do with the fact that this episode was written by Martin himself. SOME changes really do work.Agreed completely. The chain doesn't really do anything story-wise except show Tyrion's strategic prowess when compared to his sister. What we got in the show also showed his strategic prowess.I fail to see why it matters how he goes about it. You could replace the chain in the books with any of a number of different stratagems and the story would remain exactly the same.
2735	Myrddin	2012-05-29	Dramatically and visually, the wildfire was enough.
If this was a movie with all storylines driving toward this single battle, then the chain would've been a great inclusion. For this adaptation, it really wasn't needed.
Things went boom. It was good.
2736	Sarnius	2012-05-29	Hey, avid reader of the books here.
I've never quite understood how the chain worked, someone explain it to me?
2737	Lies And Perfidy	2012-05-29	Tyrion waited until Stannis's fleet was committed to the Blackwater Rush, then had Bronn raise the chain, preventing them from backing water into the Bay and cutting off Stannis's reserve (Salladohr Saan's fleet). Then he loosed the wildfire on the trapped ships.
2738	Husband to Bears	2012-05-29	Tyrion waited until Stannis's fleet was committed to the Blackwater Rush, then had Bronn raise the chain, preventing them from backing water into the Bay and cutting off Stannis's reserve (Salladohr Saan's fleet). Then he loosed the wildfire on the trapped ships.The current and burning wreckage moving into the chain also had a nasty effect. To be honest, I didn't miss the chain at all after watching the changes.  I believe the ghost riding ship/bomb was awesome, it allowed Tyrion's intellect and planning to show and it was cruel.
2739	Reposado	2012-05-29	Hey, avid reader of the books here.I've never quite understood how the chain worked, someone explain it to me?basically, as the current swept burning boats into to the chain, it held them there, creating a barrier, so that further ships couldnt get up the blackwater. those ships had to dump men far from the gates, and the men coming up from the kingswood had to create ad hoc bridges out of wrecked ships rather than be ferried across.
2740	SerMixalot	2012-05-29	The chain change worked.  Tyrion was shown to use his intellect to save the city.  That is the critical point of the story both from plotline and future character development.  It worked the way they presented it

2741	Abaddon	2012-05-29	nope fraid notWhat?  There was a frayed knot instead of the chain?  I must have missed that...
2742	Ferrum Aeternum	2012-05-29	I thought I'd have a problem with the chain being excluded from the episode. 
Then I watched the most epic scene in the history of television programming play out on screen and all possible complaints were destroyed in a glorious cloud of green flames.
2743	LÂ<U+0092>Age dÂ<U+0092>or	2012-05-29	I think the main reason was due to the fact that they wanted Stannis fighting in the vanguard and personally seeing to the task of taking the city, he would not be able to retreat if the chain was there.
2744	Fengari	2012-05-29	What?  There was a frayed knot instead of the chain?  I must have missed that...LOL.After all that worrying about the chain the past few weeks, I almost didn't realise it wasn't there /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />Olympic Bronn was a very good replacement.
2745	Natmus	2012-05-29	Hey, avid reader of the books here.I've never quite understood how the chain worked, someone explain it to me?The chain was so to speak the anvil and the hulks with wildfire were the hammer.To sum up the situation in the books, even with a great deal of troops on Stannis' large fleet, Stannis had even more troops waiting on the southern bank of the Blackwater Rush. So Stannis' fleet had several missions in the assault:- Land the troops on the ships to establish a beachhead on the nothern bank of the Blackwater.- Engage and defeat Joffrey's fleet.- Transport the troops on the southern bank to the northern bank to reinforce the assault on Kings Landing.While the trick with the wildfire, compare it to a very successfull fire-ship attack, is bad enough and destroy many ships, a significant part of Stannis' fleet could have manouvered out in the bay and avoided the wildfire, if not for the chain raised behind them, waited for the wildfire to burn away, then sailed back in and continued moving troops from the south bank to the north bank. The chain trapped almost all of Stannis' fleet to be destroyed. Even so, in the books, some of the trapped ships evaded destruction due to the random movements of wildfire and current.Without the chain, a lot more of Stannis' ships would have survived the Blackwater, and one can imagine that Stannis them could have evacuated more men when the Tyrell/Lannister army attacked him, leaving him with more men than he currently have where the books stands.In the show, all Stannis' men are aboard the fleet, so there is no need to hold the river. The entire fleet just tries to get the troops ashore. Different circumstances leading to different defensive tactics.
2746	The Owl	2012-05-29	I didn't miss the chain, and it's absence went nicely with the move from a day batte to a night one...it worked well either way
2747	DirtyRobes	2012-05-29	No:(... But we Did get Tyrion's 'Hand' chain in this episode!!! I do wonder if it occurred to the writers that they would be forced to omit One of Tyrion's important chains and so decided to wait till this episode, as a wink to readers?!?! In CoK he does have it made quite early on. I believe this is the first time its seen onscreen(anyone confirm?), ive been trying to find it all season!
2748	boojam	2012-05-30	basically, as the current swept burning boats into to the chain, it held them there, creating a barrier, so that further ships couldnt get up the blackwater. those ships had to dump men far from the gates, and the men coming up from the kingswood had to create ad hoc bridges out of wrecked ships rather than be ferried across.I have the vague recollection that the Royal Fleet burned too?
2749	FloredaA—	2012-05-31	Yes, the main difference in the books is the scope of things : while in the show one phantom boat is enough to destroy about half of Stannis' fleet (though it's night and we never see how many boats he had and how many are destroyed) and make nice fireworks, in the books  Tyrion sacrifices a few good boats of the Royal Fleet to make the feint more believable (plus it's daylight) The books are much more detailed and allow us to know exactly how many boats, the width of the river, the laying of the troops, etc. meaning the tactics have to be more thought out and believable.

2750	Howdyphillip	2012-05-28	This thread is shameless stolen from CrypticWeirwood who had the brilliant idea of starting this last week.Credit where credit is due...CREWHBO, D&D, and GRRM - For bringing this story to life...Niel Marshall - For taking a $10 million budget and making it look like he spent $80.I love his other works, but this is a crowning achievement. I can't wait to see more from him in his career.Ramin Djawadi and The National - For giving us some of the most memorable music in television history.Pixomondo studios - for making wildfire the coolest combustible ever to be seenCast (using show names)Cersei - You were insane, tender, and terrifying. I'll drink a glass of wine to that.Tyrion - Here is to the Giant of a Lannister that saved the day through cunning and courage.The Hound - When you weren't busy cleaving men in half, you were delivering the most memorable lines of the seasonStannis - To a man as hard as iron, who will break before he bendsBronn - Here is to the nose that can smell out a fight, and various other things that may give a man pleasure.Sansa - You may have bled earlier, but you became an adult here.Davos - It is terribly hard to drown an onion. They float you know.Varys - One of these days you will have to tell me the story of how you were cut.Shae - I thought you were someone else when I first met you, but I am now glad for who you areJoffery - You wanted to do the right thing, I could see it in your eyes, but you just weren't made that wayLancel - You used to be an adventurer, but then you took an arrow to the knee.(I know... It was to the shoulder... I am using another pop culture reference here so shut up.)Loras - Now I know why Westeros calls you a bad ass.Illyn Peyne - without a word, you bring death into a room.and last, but not least...Tywin Lannister - You once again proved that no matter who is in the room with you, your manhood is larger.
2751	TeamDanyArya	2012-05-28	Not that I think we need this thread quite yet, but since there was one started for episode 8 and I suggested one of these get started for each episode, I'll give it a go. We have nitpicky threads for each epiosde, let's have a gusher thread.
I'm not one for long posts so I'll try to keep this brief.
Really, this was just epic awesomeness from the start to finish.
Cersei - Ahhh, her armor. New meaning to breastplate. Her wine fueled "speech" to the ladies with the contrast of Sansa's innocence and rallying of the ladies was well-done. Her sitting on the throne with Tommen at the end had me close to crying in an episode that had me on the edge of my seat. And her telling Pycelle to go away was nice.
Sansa - It really showed off how understated and I think, underappreciated, Sophie Turner is doing with Sansa. She isn't one of my favorites but I do enjoy the actress and the show's take on her. And her dialogue with Joffery, her sarcastic responses, and his slow to pick up on it reaction, were well-played.
Joffery - Gods is he a little prick. I loved his expression as he realized he might have to fight after all. Some vunerability from the second-coming of mad King Aerys.
Tyrion - He's Tyrion, what can you say? Scared and brave at the same time.
Varys - He only needs one scene to make an impact. I love how he was on the verge of tears when he was talking to Tyrion especially when talking about the dark arts and Mel. I wonder if he knows Mel? He is the Master of Knowledge after all.
Stannis - Not one of my favs but I dig the actor playing him. Makes you almost root for him as king.
Tywin and Loras - Leave the viewer wondering why a Tyrell is next to a Lannister. Good cliffhanger for non-book readers. Sets up the next season quite nicely. And I've always loved Tywin's armor. It suites that character well.
The Hound - I almost lost it as he looked around at all the fire. The fear on his face and his willingness to just leave was great. And I liked the scene with Sansa. Less creepy than in the books. In the books, I feared Sansa would be raped but in the show, it played out better. Sansa gained a lot of courage in this episode and confronted a couple of her fears: Joffery and the Hound.
The battle scenes - BOOM. So glad I have surround sound. I don't think I've ever seen a TV show attempt anything like that and try to make it look as good as possible. They don't have a Hollywood budget and they did a fantastic job. It looked movie quality and I don't think anyone else could ever pull that off. Mad props to HBO for doing it and doing it well.
2752	Noelle Snow	2012-05-28	I'm amazed that even with that epicness there's a nitpick thread. No, we didn't get the chain and we didn't get the song from Sansa, etc. But seriously? I didn't see one thing that was a flaw in that episode. Perfect. From start to finish.
The acting, the writing, the effects, the cinematography, the direction, everything. And I think as much as we should heap praise on GRRM for giving us this brilliance, we need to give props to D&D for working so hard to even get to this point and to HBO for having enough faith to even expand their budget for this one episode.
Give it up for everyone! *applause*
2753	victim	2012-05-29	Apart from the Wildfire and Stannis being a badass and the other obvious stuff, my favourite thing in the episode has to be Joffrey. When he says "what did my mother say exactly, did she have urgent business with me?", wow! He's looking for any excuse, no matter how weak, to get the heck away from the battle. His voice was cracking, oh my Gods, I cannot get over it. 
Other than that:
- Sansa's doll. 
- "I saw you kill a man with a shield, you'll be unstoppable with an axe." - Bronn. 
- That is exactly how I imagined Cersei would be when she is drunk.
- Head explosion via rock.
- The Hound being afraid of the fire was houndled perfectly.... Sorry.
- And Pod. 
There really is so many more.
2754	Ser Adam	2012-05-29	Bahaha "houndled perfectly". Rofl. Ok, I'm done. 
I too just want to say thanks, to HBO, GRRM, and everybody else involved with any and everything ASoIaF related! My all time favorite series I've ever read, and my current favorite show!
2755	sennahoj	2012-05-29	Joffrey and Tyrion having a conversation on the battlements with the aid of Lancel und the Hound was just terribly funny, as well as the punchline: "that would make me the quarterman." Classic
2756	Dannyisnow	2012-05-29	That episode was absolutely sublime, i'm not one to point out flaws and complain at minor changes, but if i did wish to be that way i don't think i could with this episode it was fantastic !
The highlights for me were, of course the wildfire explosion ! which made me physically "Woah !", the battle scenes were immense and i thought the Bronn and Hound undertone was particularly good ( I don't think i picked that up in the books too much, so if it's been added I like it ! ). One of the things i most liked was the evolution of characters, Sansa finally took control of herself, Cersei proving she's not bullet proof and the Hound's absolute terror at fire and we even got a glimpse that maybe he has a pinch of affection somewhere...  Otherwise we saw Joffrey for what he really is, a coward, however i think non-readers had that one already established /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />, Stannis the fearless king leading the way until the very end having to be dragged away, and of course Tyrion the lion.
I cant wait for next weeks finale, i have a feeling things will tie together and certain book changes that have received many criticisms will come back around bringing the show back in line with where it needed to be with the books.
2757	BastardPoetry	2012-05-29	I created an account just to share my excitement over this episode and how great it was. Neil Marshall is a complete genius, when it comes to working with a budget 1/1000th the size of a LotR budget and making it look just as good. 
I've been lurking here for quite awhile, and I know a lot of people get upset over the little things that D&D might be doing "wrong," but I feel it's important to praise them for the overall work they've done. This series is spectacular, and you can really tell that they love the source material as much as we do. Little changes are made, for the budget, for the time limits, or for viewer-friendliness in general, but the passion is still there. (Plus, I'm one of those people who sees every alteration as either a good change at best or an understandable one at worst).
Finally, I made a poster to express my excitement over Blackwater.
It's a SPOILER if you haven't seen the episode yet--but why would you be reading the "praise for episode 9" thread if you haven't seen it yet, honestly!? I'll just put the link itself, rather than an IMG tag, because it's fairly big.http://i47.tinypic.com/izrz7s.jpg
2758	Mulled Wino	2012-05-29	I have absolutely nothing to fuss about this week.  Gonna make it a pretty lame week on the forum.  
Kudos all around, this time i want to shout out the costume designer for the show.  Loved the armor, loved Stannis army looking deathly and drag in their greys and i LOVED cersei's armor.
2759	Arkash	2012-05-29	I want to raise my glass to the men of the shadow, because I am one of them too: technicians: light, sound, make-up, settups, scripts, assistants, engineers, editors, design, costums, visual effects, producers, colorists, cameramen, steady-cam, drivers, cooks, stunt-men, fire-men...

2760	protar	2012-05-29	There's too much to list, I wish Martin had time to write every episode. One thing I did notice was Shae about to tell a story before getting interrupted. It was probably nothing, but I felt like it was Martin poking fun at all the non-canon anecdotes that are written in.
2761	TeamDanyArya	2012-05-29	Or perhaps a way for Shae to deflect Cersei's attention from her. She knows Cersei's knows something is up with her.
2762	TeamDanyArya	2012-05-29	http://i47.tinypic.com/izrz7s.jpgThank you for the new background! And welcome!

2764	protar	2012-05-30	Or perhaps a way for Shae to deflect Cersei's attention from her. She knows Cersei's knows something is up with her.Well, no doubt that was the in-universe reason. It's probably me just seeing things but kudos to you Martin if you were doing what I thought you were. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
2765	Catherine Storm	2012-05-30	Joffery - You wanted to do the right thing, I could see it in your eyes, but you just weren't made that way.Agree with this. Don't get me wrong - no sympathy at all for Joffrey!!! But his response, lol, what freakin urgent business would Cersei have with him mid battle!!! LololJack Gleeson definitely portrays this brat well.I love this episode. Easily my favourite episode of the SERIES. And maybe even of any tv show I've watched! You guys have heard about the 70-min episode next week, right? THANK YOU FOR 10 EXTRA MINUTES!!!
2766	SerMixalot	2012-05-30	Here's to guys getting their heads crushed by rocks, tops of heads sliced off, legs loppoed off by axes, bodies brutally chopped in half, spears through heads, bodies aflame and a good old fashioned body or two atomized in a massive explosion.
2767	SerMixalot	2012-05-30	Agree with this. Don't get me wrong - no sympathy at all for Joffrey!!! But his response, lol, what freakin urgent business would Cersei have with him mid battle!!!

THANK YOU FOR 10 EXTRA MINUTES!!!agreed the actor did a great job, I was even feeling bad for him, i keep thinking of him as a 13 year old kid in this position.  I half expected, when they were on the battlement for Tyrion to turn and offer a word or two of encouragement.  Well acted.
2768	TeamDanyArya	2012-05-30	What it shows also is that while Joff may talk a big talk, he truly is not fit to be king. He inspires no love in his men. Even Stannis can muster that much. It was odd, Stannis came off as the man in that battle. I like that better than in the books. It showed the viewer that Stannis should be on the Iron Throne and no one else. He is the one true king.
2769	madman2711	2012-05-31	I really think the order of thanks is
First second and third GRR Martin for giving us the books and D&D + hbo for having this marvelous premise that they put on screen 
This episode almost wiped away all the major nitpicks and i think its a epic TV hour
2770	teemo	2012-05-28	THESE ARE THE SCREEN-TIMES OF CHARACTERS FROM EPISODES 1-9:This was really a nightmare to do this episode, lol, I hope you guys still find this useful (like it if you do, please!) /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> It took me nearly two hours!!  A lot of the scenes were smushed together or really short and I was trying to allocate all of the screen-time fairly.Stats for this episode:Average length of a scene - 3:17 (it was 3:19 last week)Longest scene - Wildfire explosion scene (5:31) followed by Tyrion sending off Joffrey and leading the battle (4:35), and then Sansa and Drunk Cersei talking about a bunch of things (4:17)Most screen-time overall - Sandor Clegane at 17:37 (show some Sandor love!), followed closely by Tyrion at 17:27, Cersei at 16:55 and Sansa at 15:38Biggest moves up the screen-time ladder - Cersei, Sandor, and SansaTyrion Lannister - 85:08Arya Stark - 56:34Cersei Lannister - 52:24Jon Snow - 43:13Theon Greyjoy - 42:35Daenerys Targaryen - 40:02Sansa Stark - 39:59Catelyn Stark - 34:11Davos Seaworth - 32:50Varys - 32:39Robb Stark - 32:09Joffrey Baratheon - 30:32Sandor Clegane/The Hound - 30:20Petyr Baelish/Littlefinger - 28:25Brienne Tarth - 27:08Stannis Baratheon - 26:06Gendry - 21:59Tywin Lannister - 21:15Renly Baratheon - 20:43Bran Stark - 20:12Xaro Xhoan Daxos - 19:53Melisandre - 18:32Jaime Lannister - 17:51Samwell Tarly - 16:16Shae - 16:08Ros - 12:23Asha/Yara Greyjoy - 12:02Margaery Tyrell - 11:37Grand Maester Pycelle - 11:18Loras Tyrell - 10:04Balon Greyjoy - 7:34Roose Bolton - 6:08Absent this week - Arya Stark, Jon Snow, Theon Greyjoy, Daenerys Targaryen, Catelyn Stark, Robb Stark, Littlefinger (where is he?), Brienne Tarth, Bran Stark, Jaime Lannister, Ros, Samwell Tarly, Roose Bolton, Asha Greyjoy, and Balon Greyjoy.

2772	victim	2012-05-28	Brilliant! Surprised how far Cersei moved up, but it makes a lot of sense because she was all over this episode. I wonder if Theon or Jon will end up with more screen-time; there's a match-up to watch out for because both should have fairly large parts in the finale.
Also, I hate that Gendry has had more screentime than Bran, there's something horribly wrong with that.
(edit: I may be one of the few, but I really dislike Joe Dempsie as Gendry, I don't buy it at all).

2774	DurararaFTW	2012-05-28	Still surprised Varys is so high up, he was gone for several episodes. And yeah, Bran better get a come back in the last episode.
2775	Arkash	2012-05-28	Thanks a lot for it ! I dont know what to say but thanks, always so interesting to watch and read !
2776	Fat Mac	2012-05-28	Finally glad Stannis surpassed Renly. Also glad Davos is in the top 10.
2777	Hyper	2012-05-29	hk47, thank you again!You may wonder if we find your work useful, but we certainly do! Seeing this thread in the episode sub-forums is one of the absolute top highlights of participating in this forum. This is epic reference material that will be referenced in ASOIAF forums for years to some.The Top 10 so far of the season is looking better and more accurate to the book than ever... A great piece of supporting evidence for the hard work that the show-runners have done to balance the characters. EDIT: Yes, someone mentioned Bran. Of all the POV characters of the book, he probably treated worst when it comes to screen time. But I also understand why... His story is the easiest to collapse, and much of his material appears to be been shifted to season 3 and 4.

2778	Reposado	2012-05-29	I'll add to thanks. this is awesome. Will be interesting to combine seasons one and two when theyre both done.
Wonder how this changes next year. Would expect Jaime to be on top by page count, but unsure if sam's role will be expanded as much as it is in the book
2779	Thwacker	2012-05-29	Thanks so much HK47! Always very interesting.
2780	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-29	Ah, Sansa is getting the screentime she deserves being a major POV-character.
2781	Mediumjon Umber	2012-05-29	Happy to see that two of my three favorite characters are at the absolute top. Davos will probably see more screen time in the future.
Thanks for putting this together!
2782	gogorath	2012-05-29	Thanks so much!  I think Dany will be the big winner next episode, with Jon second, but overall, the screentime is going to come out pretty much how it should have.
Bran, unfortunately, is going to be a problem forever.  I really like his storyline, but there simply aren't a lot of external plotpoints.  Most of it is internal, and there's not a lot of even that.  aSoS is going to be two seasons; Bran has basically TWO real plot points in the whole book.  I hope they pull a Dany and make something up because even if you add some Reeds and some superhero-learning-his-power-scenes, there's not even ten episodes worth of plot in there.
2783	protar	2012-05-29	Yep, Bran has been the main problem. I don't really mind the fact that he doesn't have very much screen time. I think he could appear in 5 or 6 episodes and that would be enough. But in the books he's very present even when he's off-screen, due to his and Rickon's fake death having such a big impact on Cat and Robb. Now that they've changed the motivations for those events, it just feels like they're neglecting Bran.
2784	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-29	Much appreciated as usual. Nice to see Sandor get a rise.
It always saddens me to see Ros with more screentime than Roose, but alas...
2785	Davos55	2012-05-29	Much appreciated as usual. Nice to see Sandor get a rise.It always saddens me to see Ros with more screentime than Roose, but alas...I know you are pumped to see that Ros scene next episode from the previews then!!/smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

2787	Indigocell	2012-05-29	Has Bronn not been given enough screen time to be included on this list? Or is it just getting too big?

2788	Parise	2012-05-30	Very interesting list. Much appreciated.
So, Dany had 4 chapters and Sansa 8. Dany has still had more screentime, but that's because they tried to make Dany's story exciting and less dull since it seems like she's more popular than Sansa..

2789	JonBran	2012-05-27	If you don't like spoilers dont read this.....
Those who have read the books will know
	Spoiler Tyrion's inevitable fate, his own man turning on him and hacking off half his nose, leaving a nasty scar across his face

I truly hope once he makes his recovery that the prop team will be able to have Tyrion's nose appearing the way it should be. Given how they do not have Dinklage wear contact lenses to portray his mismatched eyes in the book, will they also leave out this physical description??
2790	Ser Joe of House Targaryen	2012-05-27	He's going to end up with a massive scar, thats for sure. His nose will most likely remain intact, though. When you think about it, tv Tyrion started off far less disfigured than book Tyrion. I dont think theyre comfortable making him ugly, really. I bet the scar wont even be that bad.
2791	Katydid	2012-05-27	*double-post*
					
					
							Edited by Katydid, 27 May 2012 - 09:27 PM.
2792	Katydid	2012-05-27	I'm okay with Tyrion's nose remaining.  In S3, it'd either be a logistical nightmare to CG out Dinklage's nose for every shot, or a horrific amount of time in the make-up chair for him.  So a nice, nasty scar will do just fine for me.
2793	Ferrum Aeternum	2012-05-27	Perfectly fine with it if they make the scar nasty enough (the wound most certainly looked nasty).  All that really matters is that his face is visibly, permanently disfigured.  I think D&D know the importance of this even if the limitations of television make an actor losing half his nose impractical.
2794	Mack Kilimaro	2012-05-27	Tyrion will come out looking like Omar. All in the game, yo.
2795	The Bastard of Bolton	2012-05-27	They couldn't be buggered to CGI out Rorge nose for the 4 minutes he was featured this entire season, considering how central a character Tyrion is, of course they wont.  Just look at the wound, it was a clean cut, he'll have a raw red line across his face and I'm glad we'll have that much.
2796	House Snow	2012-05-27	It think people are underestimating how hard the nose CGI is.  They refer to boardwalk empire, but if you watch it the guy only takes the mask off when he still or moves just a little and I think thats deliberately due to the limitations of the CGI.
2797	King Rickon	2012-05-27	Yeah, it would be stupid to remove half of Tyrion's nose as it would be time consuming and expensive and for what?  Just give him a scar and move on.  Having half of his nose missing doesn't effect what happens to Tyrion.  Having Tywin come back to King's Landing does.  He just needs to be unconscious for a few days and all will be well.
2798	scurvy	2012-05-27	I just hope both Tyrion and Davos don't appear next episode.  That would be awesome.
2799	SerMixalot	2012-05-27	how cool was it when Tyrion got that wound!  excellent CGI!
2800	zippypoodle	2012-05-27	Those who have read the books will knowI truly hope once he makes his recovery that the prop team will be able to have Tyrion's nose appearing the way it should be.

2802	Lord Godric	2012-05-27	Well he didn't really lose his nose did he?  Looked like it was still there to me.  Probably just have a scar for a while, maybe even from now on.  But I doubt it seeing how both his and Jaime's hair seems to have lost it's blondeness over the season.
2803	Lord Godric	2012-05-27	That sword slash was EPIC!I was stunned how swift it was.I wondered if it happened too quickly so that people who don't know it was a member of the Kingsguard are going to understand that.
2804	Lord Elrosir	2012-05-27	I just hope both Tyrion and Davos don't appear next episode.  That would be awesome.I would imagine that Davos would have to show up if Salladhor was going to pick him up and Mel imprisons him this season (as it has been alluded to in interviews)        .Tyrion will definitely appear (waking up) in VM.  Tywin takes the Hand position and the glory, whilst Tyrion gets the short end of the stick.

2805	StarkBlack21	2012-05-28	GRRM wrote this episode, and he emphasized how Varys HATES MAGIC. Isn't it weird Varys would be a TARG supporter when they have DRAGONS? You would think he would be anti-Targ like the BRAVOSI. HMMM
2806	Gaius Martell	2012-05-28	I wondered if it happened too quickly so that people who don't know it was a member of the Kingsguard are going to understand that.I think they've played up the Kingsguard armor enough over both seasons to make clear that it was Mandon Moore.

HMMMI don't pretend to understand Varys' intentions, but supporting the Targaryens vs Followers of Rh'llor / Asshai is pretty different in my book.  Almost everything that happens within the Rh'llor camps is magic to the nth degree whereas the Targs are pretty down to earth other than Dragons.

2812	Tytus	2012-05-28	i dont mind, at least this way we dont have him whining about his nose 24/7Yeah it wouldn't have hurt to have Tyrion say something like "what are you doing?"He's a good enough actor that he didn't have to say it, his facial expression communicated it pretty clearly.
2813	Lord Elrosir	2012-05-28	But Tyrion is smarter than that.  When he saw that Moore was aggressive towards him, I bet the first word that came to his mind was "Cersei".
2814	Harrad	2012-05-28	The extent of the wound is irrelevant. Tyrion is "a mishapen dwarf" from the get-go. Peter Dinklage wasnt and isnt. The only thing that the wound accomplishes is to lay up Tyrion for some time, so that he loses credit for his part of the battle and is undercut among the KL victors as in the book.
2815	Sel(l)mysword	2012-05-28	They have, but the Kingsguard armor isn't exactly flashy.  I'm sure they'll have Tyrion vocalize it later on, but still I wonder how many missed that.I think it'll be fine.  They have Joffrey ordering the two Kingsguard to stay close to Tyrion and a shot of Tyrion smiling at him. People should definitely know for sure it was a friendly slashing his face, and, to me, they gave enough hints. I think the best part was them cutting to Cersei right after.
2816	Nuttz	2012-05-28	It was definitely obvious enough that he was attacked by a member of the Kingsguard. I watch most episodes with my brother and he picked up on it (he was shocked). This is coming from someone who didn't know who the wildlings were and needed me to tell him, BTW.
2817	Golden Twin	2012-05-28	I really want them to chop off half his nose. He is so ugly in the books. TV Tyrion does not even have mismatching eyes and ugly ears. Also why aren't his hair white? (It does seem important for a possible *ahem* future revelation).
2818	Honey Badger	2012-05-28	You can definitely tell the people who are book readers but don't understand television.  Nose CGI is out of the question.  Facial prosthetics followed by makeup painted on top would be a significant investment to daily shoots.  Peter would need to show up at 4am every morning to get all that makeup done, ala Michael Dorn when he played Worf.  Plus remember that he's a dwarf; any makeup team needs to be careful about making him look like a cartoon character or alien.  This is fantasy, not sci-fi.  HBO deliberately chose not to make the Tyrion character look grotesque with mismatched eyes, as there are practical considerations. 
He'll get some light scar makeup to note the permanent disfigurement, and move on.  Maybe 25-30 minutes in the makeup chair instead of the usual 15.
2819	addie	2012-05-28	I will be fine if he's left with a big scar on his face. He needs to have a remarkable mark to be 'noticeabble' among all the other dwwarfs. 
Talking of Varys, I never really got why he talks of Daenerys to Tyrion in the last episode, while he's is supposed to be a Targ supporter and work for her. Anyway. Great episode.
2820	Crown	2012-05-28	That swordslash was amazing, for a moment I thought: is he dead?! Eventhough I obviously know what's going to happen.
2821	Apoapsis	2012-05-28	I just hope both Tyrion and Davos don't appear next episode.  That would be awesome.You want season-spanning cliffhangers? Why?
2822	Maithanet	2012-05-28	In the books, it is unclear whether Mandon Moore was sent by Cersei or Joffrey.  I go back and forth on this, but there's evidence and arguments to be made each way. 
But in the show, I think it's pretty obviously Joffery.  Tyrion hasn't done anything to really warrant murder from Cersei.  He didn't kidnap Tommen and threaten him with rape.  He didn't poison Cersei to keep her out of Council meetings for a while, and as far as she knows, she has great leverage over him by kidnapping his whore/girlfriend.  Cersei has been generally less ruthless in the show as well than in the books. 
Joff on the other hand, is more willing to kill and order people killed.  He did it to Ned, he did it to the bastards, and he loves ordering people to fight to the death.  Tyrion slapped him several times in public and talks down to him constantly.  Joffery does not abide this sort of slight.  I think he's clearly the prime suspect in the show.
Like the book, I imagine we won't find out who sent Ser Mandon Moore.  But I think it's a little odd that people are pointing at Cersei as if she's obviously the one.  If I were coming to the show for the first time, I'd say Joff is clearly the guy.
2823	Greywolf2375	2012-05-28	Like the book, I imagine we won't find out who sent Ser Mandon Moore.  But I think it's a little odd that people are pointing at Cersei as if she's obviously the one.  If I were coming to the show for the first time, I'd say Joff is clearly the guy.Yes, based on what we're given in the show, Cersei doesn't like him but this act would be a stretch.  Joffrey being upstaged by him, slapped and insulted multiple times makes more sense based on what they have had Joffrey do to others to this point.That said, I do hope we don't see him til next year.  Would love that as a cliffhanger.
2824	Mack Kilimaro	2012-05-28	I'd always assumed it was Cersei who set Ser Mandon to dispose of Tyrion in the books as well. The show plays it more as either commanded by Joffrey or inspired by Joffrey. What was it he said, "Ser Mandon and Ser Boras will represent the King on the battlefield"? That sounds pretty laden with innuendo to me, like Joff's just ordered Tyrion's death without Tyrion knowing it.
Working against that thought is the idea that Joff himself was so overwhelmed with cowardice from seeing some of the realities of war that he wouldn't strike me as having the confidence to order a hit. He talks big but when it hits the fan, he's nowhere to be found.
2825	Xanrn	2012-05-28	Well if you have read all the books Varys either was using Dany from the start or changed his mind when he found out she actually had Dragons.
The Epilogue from a Dance with Dragons makes it clear who he wants on the Iron Throne.
2826	Lord Elrosir	2012-05-28	Working against that thought is the idea that Joff himself was so overwhelmed with cowardice from seeing some of the realities of war that he wouldn't strike me as having the confidence to order a hit. He talks big but when it hits the fan, he's nowhere to be found.Exactly my thoughts.  Tyrion is a hindrance to Cersei's regency.  She has more to gain from Tyrions death than anyone, and makes it clear how she hates her brother.  She blames him for Joffrey in the battle, Myrcella's departure to Dorne, etc.  She wants Tyrion dead before she can due further harm to her children.
2827	Shay Baratheon	2012-05-28	Dinkledge too pretty and valuable for front page covers to maim his face too much
2828	Spring Onion	2012-05-29	I really want them to chop off half his nose. He is so ugly in the books. TV Tyrion does not even have mismatching eyes and ugly ears. Also why aren't his hair white? (It does seem important for a possible *ahem* future revelation).No, he's not 'that' and I'm pretty convinced that there will not be such revelation.
2829	Mulled Wino	2012-05-29	Wow.  Just wow.
2830	scurvy	2012-05-29	You want season-spanning cliffhangers? Why?I think Tyrion being presumed dead would be a major cliffhanger that would be outstanding.  The I assume he's dead, he's not dead, or maybe he's actually dead, thing is one of the greatest things in the books. I don't remember if Davos' fate is left to SoS or not.  I read them back-to-back so I lost track of break points for those two books.
2831	Sarnius	2012-05-28	Hey anyone who soley watches the TV show and hasn't read the books. I would like to know, what is your opinion on Stannis so far? At the battle did you want him to win? What kind of character has seemed to you as of yet?
Any contributions would be much appreciated.
2832	Arkash	2012-05-28	I just noticed that during the episode, Tyrion wears the Hand's chain around his neck instead of the unique hand we've seen since the beginning.
I wonder if George himself asked for this change, in prevision of what is to come with them... anyway, it was nice to spot them.
2833	Sambo	2012-05-28	I noticed that too, I imagine next we'll see Tywin wearing it then you know who.

They needed to make an appearance and it makes sense that GRRM would be the one to make sure it happens.

2838	The Monkey	2012-05-28	Is it a chain in the show? Always looked like a pin to me.
2839	Arkash	2012-05-28	Yes, but the thing is that this episode the pin was replaced by the chain.
2840	iheartseverus	2012-05-28	Spoiler Think of how Shae dies.
AHA!!  Of course, thanks!  My mind was totally blank..PS:  Did you see, you won the virtual lemon cakes for last night's correct guess?
2841	TheCube	2012-05-28	Is it a chain in the show? Always looked like a pin to me.That's the point. Previously, on both Ned and Tyrion, it has been a pin; Tonight, over his armour, Tyrion had a chain and it was exactly as I imagined it from the book.
2842	nachoknight	2012-05-28	I didn't see it. Do you have an image of it?Heres a printscreen from HBOGO. There may be a better view, but I just took it from the first scene.http://i48.tinypic.com/waggma.pngAHA!!  Of course, thanks!  My mind was totally blank..PS:  Did you see, you won the virtual lemon cakes for last night's correct guess?Yeah. I just wish they weren't virtual.
2843	Lord Godric	2012-05-28	Wow, I wish I had noticed that.  I wonder if they'll try to reconcile it with the pin or if they'll just end up replacing it altogether.
2844	Cressit	2012-05-28	http://s307.photobuc...sbutler_photos/Does this link work to see a good photo of the chain?  (I have never tried to post a link in the forums before.) I copied it from HBOGO. it's very, very cool looking.
2845	sadfascist	2012-05-28	Didn't notice that! Nice catch.
2846	Soiled Septa	2012-05-28	I thought that the hands were part of his armor.
2847	Lord Godric	2012-05-28	From the pictures that people have posted it does seem hard to tell if it is part of his armor or not, but I would think that if they wanted to include it they'd include it as an actual chain since it serves a role later on.
2848	Marjie Eilie Myatt	2012-05-28	Last night I spied it and thought it was part of the armor.  I assumed it was sort of a nod to the fact that this is the Hand's armor.  I was looking for movement, like a real necklace, but decided it was meant to be understood as an ornament soldered on.  The hands looked smaller than I always imagined, so I figured the costumers decided they're just not gonna go there with the chain.  I imagined something  bigger, like what Cardinal Wolsey wore as Lord Chancellor (in The Tudors; don't know if that necklace was historically accurate).
Or maybe they'll attribute the chain to one of Tyrion's changes that he made as Hand.  Maybe we'll see Tywin wearing it after he takes over, and there will be words exchanged.

Maybe we'll see Tywin wearing it after he takes over, and there will be words exchanged.I certainly hope that they'll keep it.

2850	GameofThronesFTW	2012-05-27	So is the battle over? Please no spoilers, but are all of Stannis's men killed then?
2851	Ran	2012-05-28	Yes, the battle is over. Not everyone is killed, as we saw Stannis being pulled away and his men running, but he suffered a massive defeat.
Is the war done? Well... wait and see.
2852	The Last Reyne	2012-05-28	Yep, battle done, war to be continued.
2853	salt	2012-05-28	Remember Stannis has lots of ships.  Many were burned, but not all of them.  So no, not all of his men were killed.
2854	madman2711	2012-05-28	yes he is finished and dead end of story /bawl.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':bawl:' />
2855	Monty501	2012-05-28	Stannis got away. Most of his men are dead though. And his fleet.
2856	salt	2012-05-28	Stannis got away. Most of his men are dead though. And his fleet.Well, not really.  This isn't exactly a spoiler, more a detail that wasn't focused on in the episode, but tagged just in case:
	Spoiler As was made pretty clear in the show, much of Stannis's force was made up the Stormlands men who came to his side after Renly was killed.  When they started to lose the battle tonight after Tywin and the Tyrells showed up, many of them switched sides.  The OP may have noticed Loras was wearing Renly's armor- the fact that it looked like the spirit of their old king was charging into battle helped to encourage many of them to switch.  So many of Stannis's men surrendered, some were killed, but he still has a small army left.

2864	J_JACKSON	2012-05-28	It seems strange that completely left Salladhor Saan out of the battle.  His only imprtant aspect in the book is that he is disrespted during the battle and left in the back causing him to have Stannis' only remaining ships.  If they point this out after the battle it will seem kind of forced, but I have faith that they can pull it off.
Or do you think they don't really care about Salla's role and are only using him as a foil for Davos?  Some sort of untrustworthy pirate vs loyal smuggler sort of thing?
2865	Darth Rivers	2012-05-28	So is the battle over?I am pretty sure Tywin Lannister made such an assesment, so yes.it just began  , it isn't over until only 1 of the 5 kings is alive, those who read the books know who will survive the other 4 ^^hehehehe

2868	Morvran	2012-05-27	I'm the kind of reader who often skips songs in books.  I see the italic print and skip ahead.  In the Ice and Fire series I did just that during my first read (for most songs anyway), but on re-reads I started to pay more attention to them.  But the thought of hearing them on the HBO series made me cringe b/c I assumed they would come off as silly, or stilted.  
But I have to say, I they nailed 'The Rains of Castamere'.  And the version by, I'm assuming, The National at the end??  THAT is how you adapt a song from book to screen.  Bravo.
2869	The Last Reyne	2012-05-28	Yes, it was the National at the end and there is version on youtube and it will be coming out onthe S2 soundtrack. It was really well done. I love that it was in a minor key and haunting to really stress what the song is about. It will be perfect later when Jaime has it played over and over again.
2870	Stag's Fury	2012-05-28	It'd be beautiful if we see this song again when a certain event happen /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
Although it might not be a safe move, that episode already will piss off a lot of viewers, throw in a Lannister song in the credit is only gonna make it worse.
2871	Morvran	2012-05-28	Yeah...I'm not sure they'll repeat the same song.  At least not the same version.
I have to say, thinking back on last night, the song was one of my favorite parts of the show.
2872	Castel	2012-05-28	It'd be beautiful if we see this song again when a certain event happen /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />Although it might not be a safe move, that episode already will piss off a lot of viewers, throw in a Lannister song in the credit is only gonna make it worse.It probably wouldn't be in the credits, it would be just before the "event" at which point people will go "Oh no..." and just when they begin to get really tense... BAM! Craziest moment of TV ever.I'm definitely going to watch that episode with TV only viewers. /devil.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':devil:' />

	Spoiler Like, play the tune lightly in the background for that 'oh shit' moment, and then have it cut to silence except for the drums (like in the book), and afterwards have the Rains of Castamere fade in for the credits. maybe even play it while panning over the aftermath?
and this is coming from someone who hates the Lannisters haha. though I agree it would piss off a lot of people.

But HOLY SHIT this is going to be one hell of an episode. Damn, just seeing Stannis's men charge, and Tyrion in battle, looks AWESOME. This episode will definitely be the most remembered out of the series. Is it next Sunday yet?
2882	Caro99	2012-05-20	What a preview!!! This week is going to pass by so slowly, and not cause I've got my finals, but rather cause 7 days are way too much for my nerves!! Stannis, tyrion, the hound- even ser illyn!! Most looking forward to the san/san bit (my favorite of all the books) just one question- will the episode only be about the blackwater? I don't mind at all if it is, since they've left I think everyone else in a good spot before the last episode.
2883	Sphinx The Riddle	2012-05-20	George writing the House of the Undying scenes ups the odds of us actually seeing some visions.  So pumpedwas heading in here to say the same thing.. thats the best thing that could have happen leaving it up to GRRM to write.. if its next episode
2884	nothatso	2012-05-20	I agree with gogorath. HotU is likely the last episode.
In addition to ending Dany's seasonal story arc on an interesting note, HBO is trying to be clever and wants "Valar Morghulis" to take two meanings (Arya's story + death of the undying)
2885	Umberto	2012-05-20	Lancel will be the one to attack Tyrion, it's set up perfect already.
2886	DragonAge93	2012-05-20	I think Mandon Moore will stay try to kill Tyrion. Sure, we haven't really gotten a good look at him yet, but he was shown in this episode, so obviously they are setting him up for Blackwater.
2887	victim	2012-05-21	Speaking of Mandon Moore ...
I noticed Mandon Moore got a good mention by Cersei in the Tyrion/Ros scene, and after it I was expecting to see him a little bit more to set up the character before next episode. We didn't though, and now it seems to be little more than a reference to a character currently being played by a featured extra. 
So how should his betrayal of Tyrion unfold in next weeks episode? Well, chances are it won't and I can recall someone suggesting Meryn Trant should take his place which seems like a good enough idea -- audiences have already seen him being a lacklustre guardsmen who follows Cersei and Joffrey unquestionably while also having a general dislike for Tyrion. So this idea makes sense and is helped by the fact that audiences probably already dislike the fellow.
Yet, the mention had to be for some reason outside of adding a little bit to the world. Cersei could have said Ser Arys or Ser Boros to get audiences more familiar with characters who become important later. So, I'm thinking that perhaps Moore has been cast for a kind of one-episode arc where he is told it is his duty to protect Tyrion, only to betray him for Cersei. I can't see any other point of him being mentioned outside of this; and it's in many small ways similar to mentioning the Bastard of Bolton.
What we do know however is how vital that scene is to Tyrion's storyline, so I'm pretty sure it's going to happen. As in, I'm not expecting him to run into battle only be accidentally knocked unconscious again. I guess it all depends on how much exposition at King's Landing we get before the actual battle begins.
2888	The Frostfangs	2012-05-21	That preview is fantastic. That shot of the bells with the boats coming through the fog wow... and who is that with the flaming arrow (Bronn or the hound maybe?)
2889	tripleseq	2012-05-21	Lots of hints in last episode that the chain may be gone and replaced by another solution.  The pig shit reference was pretty obvious in the sense that the wildfire will play a big part.  Note the placement of the discussion of Tyrion managing the Lannistar toilets for those years, which is true!  I wonder if all three of these are going to come together somehow?  Tyrion will pour all the wildfire down the crappers of the Red Keep and set the whole bay aflame?  Hope they've got good lids on those johhnys!
Other than that, the fact that there's no river passing anywhere near the castle in Dubrovnic is a pretty good reason that they may have been forced to make a plot shift.  You also get the sense that when the boats land they are coming in from the ocean directly by the speed and force.  In the books it would have been much different I think and they would have been paddling upstream.
Maybe Stannis will land and then watch his whole fleet go up in flames behind him.  Shot at night, which they've done, will look pretty awesome.

2890	Ser Chuck	2012-05-21	This is the main thing I've been waiting for all year, GRRM's Blackwater. The first and most epic battle we actually get to see in detail in both the books and the show. I really hope they continue the tradition of letting GRRM have the deadliest episode every season.
2891	The hairy bear	2012-05-21	I wonder if the only storyline covered in the episode will be the battle itself. Everything points to this, it seems: it's the only thread covered in HBO's synopsis, Arya and Robb's plots are already more advanced than their stoping points at the books, and Bran and Jon's are very close to its end.
Given that many episodes in this season have suffered from having to cover too many different locations, this should be good news. I'm sure it'll do marvels to the episode's pacing.
2892	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-21	One thing that worries me is how is Tywin going to get his ass over to King's Landing when he's only just moved against Robb, and there's likely no time to show him being stopped at the fords? It's a pointer in the direction of my general worry that it won't be made clear how overwhelming and outnumbering the Tyrell + Lannister horde was in the end and they'll make it far more 'heroic'...
2893	Crown	2012-05-21	That preview is fantastic. That shot of the bells with the boats coming through the fog wow... and who is that with the flaming arrow (Bronn or the hound maybe?)It's Bronn.

The first and most epic battle we actually get to see in detail in both the books and the show. I really hope they continue the tradition of letting GRRM have the deadliest episode every season.The Pointy End wasn't the deadliest episode in the first season, was it?One thing that worries me is how is Tywin going to get his ass over to King's Landing when he's only just moved against Robb, and there's likely no time to show him being stopped at the fords? It's a pointer in the direction of my general worry that it won't be made clear how overwhelming and outnumbering the Tyrell + Lannister horde was in the end and they'll make it far more 'heroic'...They'll most likely end the battle with someone passing out (Tyrion, I guess), and tell how Tywin saved the day afterwards. Like in the books.
2894	Mediumjon Umber	2012-05-21	Hm, I might have forgotten a lot from the books but did Blackwater really happen during the night? Now I know it's easier to shoot a massive battle in the dark, because it allows one to use simpler CGI and more sounds to depict the battle, but I was hoping that the guys in charge had been saving the money for this episode.
And I'm curious if Tyrion really is going to get his nose chopped off next week...
2895	madman2711	2012-05-21	i only promise that i wont be bothered by any change if GRRM wants that Tyrion rides a amphibous mechanical robot aligator with wildfire / flamethrowers he can do it i will be ok with it
maybe Tyrion rhynoplasty by the generic extra whitecloack wont be that awfull like in the books so next seasons will not require too much make-up 
on the other end hope davos and stannis dont get stupid / worthless comanders as it may seem from the buildup
for instantce stannis was sieged by Tyrell on land and Redwyne on the sea and still survived, he seiged and conquered Dragonstone and with Redwyne smashed Victarion & the iron fleet just after the Lannisport strike
he is a badass but gave in to his in-laws the Florents who are as competente warriors as the Tullys (except for the Blackfish)
2896	Pellaeon	2012-05-21	hope davos and stannis dont get stupid / worthless comanders as it may seem from the buildup for instantce stannis was sieged by Tyrell on land and Redwyne on the sea and still survived, he seiged and conquered Dragonstone and with Redwyne smashed Victarion & the iron fleet just after the Lannisport strike he is a badass but gave in to his in-laws the Florents who are as competente warriors as the Tullys (except for the Blackfish)That's might the reason we didn't see the chain yet
2897	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-21	I know Stannis has been a pretty frequent victim of the TV changes (unapologetic removal of any moral ambiguity, for one), but seeing that boat scene with Davos in episode 8 and the sight of him leading his men into battle... well. I think Dillane's Stannis is a badass regardless.
2898	Morvran	2012-05-21	Are they going to fill the Mud Gate are of the bay with pig shit so the ships founder and become easier targets for the wildfire??
2899	The hairy bear	2012-05-21	Hm, I might have forgotten a lot from the books but did Blackwater really happen during the night? Now I know it's easier to shoot a massive battle in the dark, because it allows one to use simpler CGI and more sounds to depict the battle, but I was hoping that the guys in charge had been saving the money for this episode.Yeah, it's changed to a night battle for budgetary reasons. The producers admit it in this article, which is a great read. I would recommend it for anyone complaining that anything looks "too small" this season, as they reveal that we were close to having the whole battle of the Blackwater to being a series of occasional reports received from Cersei and Sansa at Maegor's Holdfast. /eek.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':eek:' />
2900	Renasko	2012-05-21	Can't wait to see this. Pacing has been one of the show's strongest qualities, and it means this is setup perfectly to be an epic episode. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
2901	Valkyrja	2012-05-21	Doesn't the battle last into the night in the books as well?
I could have sworn the whole scene between Sandor and Sansa in her bedroom happens during the night (with the battle still raging outside).....
2902	Jolene Brown	2012-05-21	It will look so much cooler at night.  I am really dying of excitement for this episode.
2903	Crown	2012-05-21	I know Stannis has been a pretty frequent victim of the TV changes (unapologetic removal of any moral ambiguity, for one), but seeing that boat scene with Davos in episode 8 and the sight of him leading his men into battle... well. I think Dillane's Stannis is a badass regardless.I agree, Dillane's Stannis is badass to the max.First we ate the horses. We weren't riding anyway, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats.Wasn't that a great Stannis line?

2904	Valkyrja	2012-05-21	In the TV series, I feel like they've given Stannis a dash of Show!Robert to show the connection between them.....at least in his way of speech.
2905	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-21	I agree, Dillane's Stannis is badass to the max.First we ate the horses. We weren't riding anyway, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats.Wasn't that a great Stannis line?I agree. Stannis was top notch in this episode, whereas 'I cannot defeat my brother in the field!' (something Stannis would realize but never openly admit) and the whole clearly knowing about assassinating Renly and showing little to no regret for his death thing made me cringe 'cos it seemed they were simply portraying him as an unsympathetic run of the mill bad guy at first.

2907	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-21	The final Sandor/Sansa scene, I think I will die inside a little bit next week. I really hope that scene will work out, amidst Blackwater Bay. This is going to be so epic.
I CAN'T WAIT!
2908	Lord Balbi	2012-05-21	I have already made peace with the fact that there will be no tyrion's chain. I just hope he has somehow an equally important part in the defense of KL as in the books. Not just by giving a nice speech, but using his awesome brain with a kiss-ass strategy.
2909	Howl	2012-05-21	IM GONNA DIE DD::::::
2910	CrypticWeirwood	2012-05-21	Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s weird to think how this is still essentially the battle of two brothers(-in-law): Stannis vs Tyrion.
2911	So1ar	2012-05-21	That's might the reason we didn't see the chain yetI have a feeling the chain may be in because of this article I read on EW's website. It's an interview David and Dan gave for the Blackwater episode."Peter Brown, our sound designer, is our hero because he finally came up with the ice-cracking chatter we had in our heads when we imagined the White Walkers speaking Skroth. For Blackwater, he had to orchestrate a major naval battle and a land battle. And he had to come up with something very big and very loud, which would be a spoiler to explain but book readers will understand."To me it hints at the sound of a chain being raised.
2912	Sambo	2012-05-21	For Blackwater, he had to orchestrate a major naval battle and a land battle. And he had to come up with something very big and very loud, which would be a spoiler to explain but book readers will understand." To me it hints at the sound of a chain being raised.Or the roar of wildfire burning.  I may be misremembering but in the books doesn't the burning wildfire make a giant green flame tornado as it burns?
2913	Valkyrja	2012-05-21	The final Sandor/Sansa scene, I think I will die inside a little bit next week. I really hope that scene will work out, amidst Blackwater Bay. This is going to be so epic. I CAN'T WAIT!I know GRRM is writing this episode, but nonetheless I can't help but worry that it won't get the treatment it deserves. I am uncertain how effective it will be given the lack of set-up for it during the previous episodes. I know they gave Sandor and Sansa a couple random scenes here and there, but they have not really explained their views toward each other adequately at this point for the 'Blackwater bedroom scene' to be truly effective --- at least, not how it was written in the books.Which leads me to think that either Martin will write a quick scene in between the two of them prior to that scene, or else the scene will be included but will be greatly altered from the book. I am not against changes just for the sake of being a purist -- I don't mind changes, if done well, and if they still manage to convey the same characters and plot that we love so well. Nevertheless, I am curious and more than a little skeptical about how this scene will play out in the coming episode. Edited to say: I'm not blaming GRRM for any possible changes....but rather worried that the poor treatment of these two character's previous interactions will have a (negative) butterfly effect on any scene(s) between them in 'Blackwater'.

2914	Crowned Stag	2012-05-21	I sure hope I see a chain in this episode though I am seriously doubting we will.  If not they better do a damn good job of giving Tyrion a huge chunk of the credit for the upcomming battle in the viewers eyes.  His whole motivation for the next book is based on how underappreciated he was during his time as the hand and his strategy in this battle, mixed with his sudden loss of power and disfigurement.   So many scenes I had in my head for this book have already been taken.
2915	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-21	Or the roar of wildfire burning.  I may be misremembering but in the books doesn't the burning wildfire make a giant green flame tornado as it burns? The wildfire wouldn't be a spoiler because we already know of it. Which leaves either the chain or... the sound of a huge army coming over the hills as the only remaining possibilities.
2916	Crown	2012-05-21	Here, the 'previously on Game of Thrones' segment for the Blackwater episode --> http://www.youtube.c...cE&feature=plcpJudging on that we're getting a King's Landing only episode (including Sandor/Sansa scenes, and Tywin to the rescue). My expectations are high.EDIT: The recap of the previous episode is always the previously on segment for the next episode, for those who didn't know.

2917	insertname	2012-05-21	Hmmm, in the preview Tyrion says "Rain fire on them". Are the ships with wildfire getting cut? That was good part of Tyrions plan as well, a way of not having the wildfire burning in the city...

That was good part of Tyrions plan as well, a way of not having the wildfire burning in the city...I imagine a fleet of burning ships crashing into other ships was the first thing to go when they were working on the budget.

That was good part of Tyrions plan as well, a way of not having the wildfire burning in the city...I can't find the source, but I'm sure I read that they moved a part of the battle to solid ground (budget reasons). I assume Tyrion will speak the line when Stannis' men landed on the shore and are marching toward the city gate.EDIT: I'm sure we're getting wildfire aswell, since they introduced it already.

2924	Arya The Assassin	2012-05-21	Article about the Battle of Blackwater-episode (MINOR Spoilers!):'Game of Thrones': Blackwater battle has 'dramatically exceeded our expectations'I really look forward to this episode, but at the same time we have to keep in mind that we're not talking about a $150 M budget here, so it would be unrealistic to expect something like LOTR. Nonetheless, I believe they'll manage to pull this off in a relatively convincing manner, given their lower budget. There haven't been a lot of major action scenes in season 2 anyway, so episode 9 should be a treat /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Benioff: One great advantage we have over the movies is that when one of our characters wades into battle, weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve spent almost 19 hours with these characters. You know them so well and hopefully youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re worried for them. And some of them are gonna die. There is a way of shooting a battle where you see an army of a hundred thousand attacking an army of two hundred thousand. Thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s also the groundâ<U+0080><U+0099>s eye view where youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re an infantryman and youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re running out there with an axe or a sword or something, youâ<U+0080><U+0099>re not seeing the grand scale of it.I'm quoting Benioff in full here, because he's got a very good point. This is one of the reasons why I didn't feel the LOTR-movies were particularly good (apart from the first one) or engaging: The battles were visually stunning, but I didn't care much for the characters, so the movies felt more like style over substance. And depicting the battle from the ground's eye view can be very effective as well, as shown in Steven Pressfield's epic battle novels (illustrates very well the raw physicality, brutality and chaotic nature of such battles from a 1st person POV) and the movie Saving Private Ryan (I'm not saying that big, 'epic' establishing shots are totally unnecessary, though. I'm just saying that it's not necessarily only a matter of scale and epicness). EDIT: BTW, interesting that they've hired Neil Marshall. I've seen all his movies, and he makes decent action/sci-fi/horror movies on smaller budgets.

2929	Warden of the North121	2012-05-21	This is sort just a random comment but I'm glad that Cersei and Sansa haven't had any scenes with those ridiculous southern hairstyles lately. Honestly I found it distracting  and quite frankly they both look much prettier with their hair down (not that that's the only important thing about their characters of course).
2930	Valkyrja	2012-05-21	More Sophie Turner is good to me!I agree, I actually like her as an actress. She has done a decent job with the material she's been given -- it is just a pity they haven't given her more to do (as of yet)......I'm hoping they will somehow manage to show the contrast between Sansa and Cersei's reactions to the battle, with Cersei drinking, getting panicky about Joffrey, and then leaving the women when they need her most, vs. Sansa, who keeps her head and tries to calm everyone around her, and even tends to Lancel's wounds.Even if they don't show all of that, it would be great if they somehow get across this same idea. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Edited to add: I agree wholeheartedly about those silly hairstyles....it really took me out of the 'moment' last season.

People continually underestimate the budgetary restrictions.  Even with the extra cash, Blackwater probably "only" cost $10M-$15M more than the previous season's $6M average (although some of that is shared cost across episodes).  It's an hour long, but how many great period action movies have budgets anywhere near that low?  Not many.
2935	Arkash	2012-05-21	We may see the chain according to that interview of D&amp;D...
As for the rest, I really like the fact they decided to shoot the battle at human scale: first, its better, second, its cheaper.
And I really look forward the more calm moments (the citadel of Maegor with the women, the Sansa bedroom scene...).
And answering to what someone said in the very first page of this thread: yeah, I liked the:
"Ony two episodes left !"
"There's too many !"

2936	Valkyrja	2012-05-21	I agree, they need some 'on foot' battle scenes, since those have been pretty much non-existent this season. (They missed a good opportunity to show at least a scene or two of Robb in battle, but once again, I do understand the budgetary issues in that regard.)
I often find on-screen battles between ships to be quite confusing, visually. I think the battle is going to be just fine, whatever they do. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
It's the 'little scenes' and the character moments that I am more apprehensive about, but again....still hopeful. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
2937	Caro99	2012-05-21	totally agree on the concerns you've mentioned for san/san Valkyrja.. if they decide to give them a mini-scene before the moment in her bedroom, i will be happy, but apart from the anticipation i fear this up-coming episode for the changes we'll see just as much as i am excited to finally watch the

& thanks Crown for the re-cap video of last night's episode. a confirmation of sorts of having that moment in! /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

2938	Warden of the North121	2012-05-21	Am I the only who feels like they'll have a ton to cram into the season finale given how all of episode 9 is devoted to Blackwater/KL?
2939	Arkash	2012-05-21	Actually, it could work:
- Dany: Hotu (one big scene) + final scene leaving on that ship sailing to Astapor Jorah talked about.
- Jon: Qhorin's last order, then later the fight and ends.
- Sam: the three horn-blows.
- Tyrion; waking up and aftermath of the battle.
- Sansa: relief at not being bethroted to Joffrey anymore.
- Catelyn / Robb: not that much I think, maybe one scene.
- Jaime / Brienne : one fight sequence, maybe ending on them being captured and Jaime's hand chopped.
- Bran: leaving the crypts and Winterfell.
- Theon: the sack of Winterfell.
The longest story-arcs for the finale shall be Dany, Theon, Tyrion, it can work !
2940	Triskan	2012-05-21	I agree, Dillane's Stannis is badass to the max.First we ate the horses. We weren't riding anyway, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats.The best is how he says "Never liked cats, so fine" so dismissively.
2941	Patchface12	2012-05-21	Yeah, it's changed to a night battle for budgetary reasons. The producers admit it in this article, which is a great read. I would recommend it for anyone complaining that anything looks "too small" this season, as they reveal that we were close to having the whole battle of the Blackwater to being a series of occasional reports received from Cersei and Sansa at Maegor's Holdfast. /eek.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':eek:' />Reading this article gives me much greater respect for D & D and more forgiving of the changes they have made (except maybe Alton's murder). Personally, I think Tyrion sending wildfyre caches thru the cisterns of KL into the Blackwater is just as awesome as the chain.
2942	Valkyrja	2012-05-21	totally agree on the concerns you've mentioned for san/san Valkyrja.. if they decide to give them a mini-scene before the moment in her bedroom, i will be happy, but apart from the anticipation i fear this up-coming episode for the changes we'll see just as much as i am excited to finally watch the

I am going to be on the edge of my seat the whole time I'm watching it.....not because it is so gripping but because I'll be so scared until I see the whole thing! /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
2943	Chelly	2012-05-21	I can't wait for this episode. There's going to be so much awesomeness packed in the hour. Stannis attacking KL, wildfire, Tyrion being a boss, Davos being in the middle of the action, the battle, and yes the Sansa bedroom scene with Sandor. I think its all going to be very memorable.
2944	Warden of the North121	2012-05-21	Actually, it could work: - Dany: Hotu (one big scene) + final scene leaving on that ship sailing to Astapor Jorah talked about. - Jon: Qhorin's last order, then later the fight and ends. - Sam: the three horn-blows. - Tyrion; waking up and aftermath of the battle. - Sansa: relief at not being bethroted to Joffrey anymore. - Catelyn / Robb: not that much I think, maybe one scene. - Jaime / Brienne : one fight sequence, maybe ending on them being captured and Jaime's hand chopped. - Bran: leaving the crypts and Winterfell. - Theon: the sack of Winterfell. The longest story-arcs for the finale shall be Dany, Theon, Tyrion, it can work !I guess I'm just thinking in the context of the last episode where nothing really happened to advance any storylines except the Robb/Talisa sex scene and the cop-out escape from harrenhal (which was a bit lame to be honest). Where as if they conduct the finale the way you have it would probably be the one of the best episode of the series.

2947	_Oberyn_	2012-05-21	Or GRRM shows piffling noobs how its done /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
2948	Istari	2012-05-21	I will admit, I am one of those people who really believes that San/San have unfinished business and their relationship - whatever it may be - will become relevant in the next two novels.
Which is why I really hope that the Sandor / Sansa bedroom scene is given the attention it deserves. 
This is the way I see it: If GRRM doesn't emphasize it for the HBO script, then perhaps their relationship was never that significant in the end. 
That being said, there could be other reasons for a potential snub. One reason, off the top of my head,  would be a result of not setting up the characters properly to do a scene that intimate. For non-reader's it may not carry much significance, and would most likely come off as creepy and 'out of nowhere'.
I may be putting too much weight on a single scene from a single episode of a 1000-page-book-to-a-10-hour-tv adaptation thats not even canon ...but I still have my concerns....
Nevertheless, I have no doubt it will be fucking great 
******note: I realize that GRRM is not the captain of the show and therefore may have to make some unwanted changes
2949	MikeNH	2012-05-21	In case anyone missed it, the "pig shit" comment in the last episode was a reference to Bronn's discussion about wildfire w/ the Pyromancer.
It went something like:
Bronn:  "...old men wheeling around jars of pigshit..."
Pryo:    "Our order does not deal in pigshit!"
I don't think Tyrion was talking about literal shit (pig or human).
2950	Golden Twin	2012-05-22	@Arkash. I don't man this seems really ambitious. Considering the changes the producers have been making (let's not get into the discussion of those because they make me very very angry), I think it a revised structure would be -Actually, it could work: - Dany: Hotu (one big scene) + final scene leaving on that ship sailing to Astapor Jorah talked about. - Jon: Qhorin's last order, then later the fight and ends. - Sam: the three horn-blows. - Tyrion; waking up and aftermath of the battle. - Sansa: relief at not being bethroted to Joffrey anymore. - Catelyn / Robb: not that much I think, maybe one scene. - Jaime / Brienne : one fight sequence, maybe ending on them being captured and Jaime's hand chopped. - Bran: leaving the crypts and Winterfell. + Theon: the sack of Winterfell. The longest story-arcs for the finale shall be Dany, Theon, Tyrion, it can work !They would emphasize the aftermath of the battle. Some exploration of the Lannister-Tyrell alliance (remember the red and green people are gonna rush in at the end of the next episode to save the day). Also let's not forget that the episode is titled Valar Morghulis ... I am guessing this is where Arya is supposed to get the coin but that can't happen now that she has left Harrenhal?! Any idea why they would do this? Did they show Jaqen leaving/ not leaving?
2951	Sharpes	2012-05-22	Honestly, I just hope for once this season we get an episode that actually lasts 60 mins, not this pissy 54-56 mins that we've been getting lately. =/
2952	Lord Yarwyck	2012-05-22	My prediction is that the naval battle will be cut and there will be a straight up landing and siege, which is why Tyrion's chain has had no mention - Naval battles are really really difficult and expensive to film (even Pirates of the Carribean limits itself to single-ship encounters), and I can't think of any time a large scale ancient/mediaeval naval battle has been committed to screen (any film buffs here, feel free to correct me).  I don't mind - budget and all that, as I think it will still be awesome.
Hopes:
- Lancel isn't the one who tries to kill Tyrion, but rather gets a middlingly awesome moment to make up for being everyone's butt monkey.
- Pod
- The marvelous scene from the books, with all the chivalry of Highgarden and Casterly Rock riding through a rain of ash at dawn to relieve the city.
- The encounter between Sandor and Sansa. 
- The throne room scene at the end, where Joffrey cuts himself then runs off weeping.
- Lots of Tywin.
- I know this one is incredibly unlikely, but Josmyn "Peck" Peckledon's badassery (killing two knights, wounding a third and capturing two more).  
Fears
- Lancel tries to kill Tyrion.
- No Pod
2953	madman2711	2012-05-22	it must be an EPIC tv moment 
hope it willnot be an epic fail
San/San not a very big fan but a small scene could work 
but i really want Tyrion to shine as he is by far the only guy who went all in with his defense of KL
Cersei and Jeofrey would have lost it before Granpa Tywin the Funny Guy and the Rosie Tyrell that couldn win a battle by himself although has the largest army (Samwell Tarly Dad is as badass as Stannis yet quite underdog in the Westeros)
2954	LordofWinter	2012-05-22	My prediction is that the naval battle will be cut and there will be a straight up landing and siege, which is why Tyrion's chain has had no mention - Naval battles are really really difficult and expensive to film (even Pirates of the Carribean limits itself to single-ship encounters), and I can't think of any time a large scale ancient/mediaeval naval battle has been committed to screen (any film buffs here, feel free to correct me).some movie with russell crowe. i forget what it's called, but there are a couple of epic ship battles. there are other movies too but it's late and my brain isn't working at full power.
2955	Alys Karstark	2012-05-22	Some wild guesses/predictions for the last episodes:
1) Is the actor playing Barristan Selmy hired for this season? What if instead of saving Dany from a manticore, he is somehow involved in her rescue from the House of the Undying? From what we have seen in the Drogon CGI, it is still not believable that his fire can burn a building and he might need extra help in saving Dany.
2) What if instead of being stopped at the Fords, Tywin will emulate Robb Stark's diversion from season 1 by sending a small force to meet the Northmen but actually committing the larger part of his army to the defense of King's Landing.

It would be a great surprise for him to return.2) I think Tywin's sending his entire force to King's Landing.
2957	Nathaniel Hawke	2012-05-22	As this episode is written by GRRM himself, I'm quite eager to counter any 'fans' that will be complaining for trivial changes that made them 'lose faith' to the show. Myself, I'd bet that quite a lot of their budget has gone to this one, judging from the preview. And many storylines to conclude in this one and the finale. I hope they've done a good job!
2958	The Knight of Flours	2012-05-22	Actually, it could work:- Dany: Hotu (one big scene) + final scene leaving on that ship sailing to Astapor Jorah talked about.- Jon: Qhorin's last order, then later the fight and ends.- Sansa: relief at not being bethroted to Joffrey anymore.- Catelyn / Robb: not that much I think, maybe one scene.- Bran: leaving the crypts and Winterfell.I'd definitely love to see some of these as the last cliff-hangers in this series:- Robb introducing Queen Talisa to Cat- Joffrey telling Sansa that he won't be marrying her, but he will still be fucking her- Three horns for Sam with perhaps a big SFX shot of hordes of walkers approaching as the closing shot
2959	Arkash	2012-05-22	It was strange how last episode, Tywin was like attacking Robb Stark, I really hope they dont change his real destination (KL), and this was just a diversion...
As for the final episode, it is quite confirmed by the only summary we have of it that we will have a fight scene with Brienne and Jaime, dunno if it will go as far as the chopped hand but who knows ?
2960	Ser Dermett Corbray	2012-05-22	Expecting three stories to take precendence in this episode.Obviously the battle will be the major part of the episode.Sansa/Cersei's scenes need to be perfect, the whole suicide-pact thing if Stannis gets into the city etc. The Hound's drunken advances on Sansa too.Perhaps the battle could be cut between Dany's visit to the House of the Undying. They need to make the visit to the House as mindfuckingly great as it can be to warrant the constant removal from the action on the Blackwater. In the Lord of the Rings, wasn't Helms Deep constantly cut between shots of the battle and Sam talking to Treebeard? It needs to be like that. But better.Edit: Just realised HotU is probably going to be in the last episode. Oh well.

2968	KAralinda	2012-05-22	Actually as fan of the books, and watcher of the tv series , iam more curious about this episode because of the director Neil Marshall ...
his film "centurion" was excelent for a not "big budget" movie... and the action scenes were really well directed and edited.

2970	WillWork4NinjaPowers	2012-05-22	My guess:
Talisa will tell Robb she is Jeyne.  They story she gave is that of her Grandmother's.  Robb will meet her family.  Talisa/Jeyne is in on something with Roose, right now.  There are knowing looks whenever they pass each other in the tent.  I think they weren't planning on Jeyne actually falling in love with Robb.  She was supposed to just be a spy, passing on info from Roose to Tywin.  Roose is so adamant about Ramsay going to Winterfell, because that is part of the plan, for the Bolton's to hold Winterfell for Tywin.  There was no Weasel Soup because in the TV version, Roose gets to take Harrenhall without a fight, since he is already partnered with Tywin.  
Mandon Moore will try to kill Tyrion, Pod will save him.
No chain, but wildfire from the sewers, trapping the ships.  
Not sure if there will be a "Renley" sighting.
Arya will see Jaqen, he will change his face.
By Ep. 10, Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie will have run into someone from the Brotherhood.
2971	LeananKite	2012-05-22	Fears - Lancel tries to kill Tyrion. - No PodI hope that not Lancel will try to kill Tyrion because he is important in ADWD for accusing Cersei. This would be a great change for his character and would cause a lot of changes in the stroyline.I could not stand this.
2972	Targaryen loyalist	2012-05-22	I'm still convinced that the HotU will be at the beginning of season 3, also due to budget restrictions (it's a massive-CG scene with a lot of extras).
2973	Sambo	2012-05-22	It occurred to me that the end of episode 9 of season 1 was where they had the "main character" Ned Stark lose his head.  Anyone else think they might end this episode on a cliffhanger with the "main character" Tyrion Lannister's fate in question?

2975	Crown	2012-05-22	I'm still convinced that the HotU will be at the beginning of season 3, also due to budget restrictions (it's a massive-CG scene with a lot of extras).Seems unlikely.Episode 10 -- "Valar Morghulis"Tyrion awakens to a changed situation. King Joffrey doles out rewards to his subjects. As Theon stirs his men to action, Luwin offers some final advice. Brienne silences Jaime; Arya receives a gift from Jaqen; Dany goes to a strange place; Jon proves himself to Qhorin.
2976	Sambo	2012-05-22	if they do choose to leave Tyrion's fate a mystery they'll do it at the end of ep.09 (and later have it revealed that he is alive in ep.10)Yeah, that's what I meant.

Sometimes, the original writer is too close to the material to be willing to make the kind of cuts that are necessary for the work to be effective in the new medium.  Of course, most of you don't believe that changes are necessary for the work to be effective in the new medium, so I suppose that there's no convincing you.
2981	Lord Rickard Snow	2012-05-22	Don't you guys know in the Show Maester Pycelle has his medical grade stainless steel ring on his chain, for his degree in microsurgery
but really I'm suspecting a Scar on the Cheek or across the nose, maybe nothing,  but an attempt on his life
and for the Chain, I'm not holding my breath as of the last episodes scene with Tyrion and Bronn, Tyrion was still planning the defense, and i don't see them bringing in a plot point that hasn't been at least hinted toward (although maybe the Book Tyrion is reading on the Show gave him that idea)....but on the other side of the coin this is the GRRM written episode so maybe they're holding it back for him and a surprise to the readers who expect its not going to happen.
Sit back and Enjoying the Show = Heaven ...
Having to wait a week for the next episode = Seven Hells!!!
Dreaming of the reaction of non-readers to the Red Wedding = Priceless

2982	Darth Pipes	2012-05-22	Judging from the clips we've seen, there looks like they'll be some fighting on the sea.  I doubt much but something.
Pod can be seen in the original episode preview.  He's on the steps when Tyrion gives his "Let go kll them!" speech.
About Stannis's dialogue, I think it works because he's not a charismatic man.  I wouldn't worry too much about his dialogue since GRRM is writing the episode.  He knows what Stannis would say while leading men into battle.
One scene I'd love to see but I"m sure we won't because it would be difficult and dangerous to film is when the Hound rides his horse into the water, up the gangplank of one of Stannis's ships and starts cutting down men.  Would be epic but it's never going to happen.

There's only so much Iain Glen can do.We almost certainly won't see Dany (or Jon, or Sam, or Bran, or Theon, or Arya, or Catelyn, or Robb) in episode 9 - it's going to focus entirely on the Blackwater.
2984	jlk7e	2012-05-22	Also, the interview with Benioff and Weiss (from EW?) makes it clear that they're going to show a naval component to the battle.  They specifically fought for including the naval component when they were asking HBO for more money to be able to shoot the battle right.
2985	Crown	2012-05-22	One scene I'd love to see but I"m sure we won't because it would be difficult and dangerous to film is when the Hound rides his horse into the water, up the gangplank of one of Stannis's ships and starts cutting down men.

Would be epic but it's never going to happen.Gods, I would looooove to see that scene!But I agree......its not going to happen. They couldn't even have them on horseback for the riot scene......so I highly doubt they'll have elaborate horseback stunts for this battle either. But wow, that would be awesome.Speaking of the Hound and his horse, I do hope that we get to see Sandor's stallion Stranger next season at least.......I love horses, and Stranger is such a great character. /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
2987	protar	2012-05-22	The author of a book certainly can be a good person to adapt it for the screen, but you are fooling yourself if you think that this is inevitably the case.  Sometimes, the original writer is too close to the material to be willing to make the kind of cuts that are necessary for the work to be effective in the new medium.  Of course, most of you don't believe that changes are necessary for the work to be effective in the new medium, so I suppose that there's no convincing you.Yes, but Martin is himself has done script writing for TV, and has had to adapt some of his friend's work. I think Martin will be both stay faithful to the books, and have a keen enough understanding of the differences between the two mediums to make the right cuts.
2988	_Oberyn_	2012-05-22	Also, the interview with Benioff and Weiss (from EW?) makes it clear that they're going to show a naval component to the battle. They specifically fought for including the naval component when they were asking HBO for more money to be able to shoot the battle right.I cant picture how this will work given that they have the wrong type of ships.
2989	Lord Rickard Snow	2012-05-22	Things are no doubt going to change...It's an adaptation after all, Knowing that GRRM has Been involved in television throughout his career and i think he'll be more willing to make the tough changes that another author in his position would not do so willingly.
Referring to S01E08 "Baelor" Scene where Ned is being led to The Sept, he saw Yoren and said "Baelor..Baelor!!!!!" to indicate to Yoren his daughter needed protection. a much more emotionally griping scene that way and plays well on the screen, not sure if it  was George's Idea but he wrote that episode..just to lend some credence to the fact George will do Right by his own Story.
thanks Crown..... i cant seem to keep it all straight in my head who wrote what where and why...i should have checked my facts also i remember that interview where he mentioned he wished he had thought of that...
i guess my point is moot.....

Concerning the scene you're referring to, GRRM didn't write it. Afterwards he said that he should have thought of that while writing the scene in his books, since he thought it was great. I have no source, sorry.

2991	The Ragged Man	2012-05-22	I know that i'm gonna get a lot of hate for this but... GRRM is not that great of a writer himself you know. I like the series as a whole but he's not even in my top ten writers of all time .Do you mean his television writing or the ASOIAF series?
2992	Crown	2012-05-22	Do you mean his television writing or the ASOIAF series?I'm sure he referred to the books.
2993	Darth Pipes	2012-05-22	One thing I'm especially looking forward to is that is appears this episode will take place in one location.  As much as I've enjoyed this season, I think one of the problems has been that there are so many characters we haven't had a ton of screentime for any of them.  Dinklage has probably had the most screentime but when you add it all up, it's still not a lot when spread over ten episodes.  By focusing it in one area, you narrow the amount of characters you use and give them more time.  What's going on in King's Landing during the battle will have the sole focus and I'm really looking forward to that.
Eugene Simon, who plays Lancel, talked briefly about Blackwater durnig an interview with the TV Guide and stated that he had a fight scene with some stuntmen.
We haven't see much of the Hill Tribes this season, I wonder if they'll show up during the battle.
2994	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-22	I'm sure he referred to the books.Guess so. I don't know why though. The book series.. I can't think of one thing I would change, it's flawlessly written. (Of course, I can come up with some minor changes in the plot, but we'll see how everything works out in the sixth and seventh book.)

The build-up, the actual fight, the scenes with Cersei and Sansa which I hope will work out as I picture them, and the scene with Sandor and Sansa of course. The aftermath maybe, the fate of Tyrion. I really can't wait.
2996	Arkash	2012-05-22	Been thinking: Polliver is not dead and still have Needle, I guess he will be the one in charge of Harrenhal after the Mountain and the one to chop off Jaime's hand.

2998	Crown	2012-05-22	I still think they need the Brave Companions and Roose Bolton in Harrenhal for next season in order to not butcher Jaime's SoS storyline.They can have Rorge and Biter play the role of Vargo Hoat, and just add some non-named Brave Companions to their crew.
2999	jlk7e	2012-05-22	It doesn't make any sense why Polliver would cut off Jaime's hand.
3000	Warden of the North121	2012-05-22	They can have Rorge and Biter play the role of Vargo Hoat, and just add some non-named Brave Companions to their crew.This may be what they do. Vargo Hoat on screen would have been entertaining though, "Kingsthlayer you are my captith!" one of the many reasons why Storm of Swords is the best book I have ever read.

I hope we are indeed getting the Reeds next season.  Also, the fact that they are looking for amputees could either mean we are getting Vargo Hoat and the brave companions after all, or they're going to be getting into ADWD "Reek" storyline a bit soon. Here's hoping for a Vargo Hoat that sounds like the bastard spawn of Jack Swagger and Sylvester the Cat.
3003	Warden of the North121	2012-05-22	i would love Lancel to get his injury by accidently running into Stannis...That would be a good way to show Stannis being a bamf. It looks like they're having him participate in the fighting judging from the promo.

Vargo Hoat on screen would have been entertaining though, "Kingsthlayer you are my captith!" one of the many reasons why Storm of Swords is the best book I have ever read.We really need Vargo Hoat! If you find an actor who can bring on this mixture of evil stuff and the funny performance....it would be so awesome.So many great lines.Well I got to stop to hope too much for season 3 - but I think the handchopping will happen then and that is such an important part of the story - we need a real good buildup for that and we need the Bloody Mummers.

3006	Ser Dermett Corbray	2012-05-22	Vargo Hoat needs to be in it, as already said. His lisp and his penchant for violence is just too awesome to not be included. It will also help Brienne realise there are more despicable shits in Westeros than the "kingthlayer".
I'm hoping for the whole lot of the Brave Companions tbh. Jason Mamoa wants to come back, they should recast him as a random Dothraki mercenary (they had Dothrakis in their ranks I seem to recall). Add a bit of flavour to this band of psychotic mercenaries. Oh and Shagwell the insane jester. "I'm too droll to die," one of the funniest lines in the entire series for me.
I'm asking too much now but whatever.
3007	Ciglon	2012-05-22	While the battle of the blackwater plus setup etc will take a lot of time, I highly doubt it would take 60 mins.They need to show Jon's storyline move forward and really clarify what the halfhand's mission for jon is, since they just mentioned it last episode (maybe just one or two scenes). This can't all take place in the finale, also, we'll probably get some pre-action setup for theon as well, maybe introduce the northerners seiging winterfell and theon trying to come up with a plan, along with related to that maybe a scene with roose and robb to stress the fact that roose's bastard is heading towards winterfell and/or is already there so that they know that roose betrays robb if they do that in the finale. (two or three scenes)The finale will have a lot of things to tie up, not even mentioning they have to show the aftermath of the battle in KL from tyrion's pov waking up.The finale's 60 mins will be plenty to cover all of that and really tie up all the ends, leave a good cliffhanger or two and end with a bang, but the resolution for all these other characters has to start next episode, so while I think about 40 mins will be related to KL (prep, battle from both lannister and stannis pov) these other scenes with other characters have to happen as well, I'm guessing taking up maybe 20mins~ or so.They may even show a Daenerys scene, although unless it's literally a scene of her deciding to visit the HotU and talking to pyat pree about going and/or literally walking over there, it would really just be a waste of a scene and it would just feel like they're prolonging the qarth arc that they made up even more like last week's scene.ETA: typos.

3009	Ciglon	2012-05-22	The finale is 10-15 minutes longer than a typical episode from what I've heard so I think they'll hold off on most Non King's Landing/Blackwater stuff until then.True, they could tie everything up in the finale (even though I haven't heard it's any longer than 60 mins as usual, do you have a source? just wondering, would be exciting if true).But I don't think they should, really. They can't show winterfell being sieged in the beginning of ep 10 and have the conflict resolved by the end of the episode, it would be too rushed and not enough excitement would be built up for it, same with jon imo.If it's just blackwater this week, why would people be excited to watch again for the finale at all? They'll just be like "Oh, I guess next week they'll show everyone else, that's cool" and may even forget about the exciting stuff that the other character POV's have been leading up to (HotU, Qhorin fight, Winterfell etc)They have to show a big bang with the battle, but they also have to build up some excitement for conflict resolution for the finale, which would really only take 1 or 2 scenes for each other character, about 15-20 mins max.Also, I think the producers are really not eager to ever leave POV's out of entire episodes, they typically like to show each character have at least one scene. Again, they don't have to and they've done it in the past which is fine, but I think they will show at least one scene of most other character aside from KL. Arya is one POV they may leave out entirely, or they might just show her trying to stay out of sight and navigate her way before Jaqen catches up with her in episode 10.

3010	Francis Buck	2012-05-22	I think they're definitely going to cut back and forth between Blackwater and the House of the Undying. Not only are those two parts arguably the best in the second book, but they essentially serve as the climax for the season, with the denouement being episode ten (much like last season). Having both of those scenes would be a serious mind-fuck for people, and it will probably be a crazy as hell episode. I have a feeling that the ninth episode of every season is consistently going to be the big crazy one, with the final episode being more of the fallout and set-up/cliffhangers for the next season.

In Winterfell, Maester Luwin has some final advice for Theon. In Harrenhall, Jaqen H'ghar gives Arya a gift, and Dany visits a wondrous place in Qarth. Beyond the Wall, Jon Snow pleases Qhorin with his actions.The episode 10 synopsis strongly indicates the HotU is in the finale, as frustrating as it seems. Also this website indicates that the season finale is 64 minutes while Blackwater is 57 minutes, making these two episodes the longest of the season.

3015	Grey Robb	2012-05-22	That's an extras casting call. I doubt Vargo Hoat would be an extra.I was more or less referring to the fact that they are looking for amputees.  If it was just Jaime that is going to lose his hand, then they could use make up or CGI it rather than casting actual amputees (emphasis on the plural).  It seems more like they are planning on showing multiple amputees, possibly as evidence of Bloody Mummers' victims.  The Bloody Mummers owe their propensity towards amputation to Vargo Hoat.  It's just hopeful speculation that they will decide to cast the character to reiterate this occurrence from the books.
3016	Triskan	2012-05-22	We have to get The Goat. 
Joffrey and Ramsay are the most horrible people in the books, but no one is more fun to hate than The Goat.
3017	House Snow	2012-05-22	I would be shocked in Vargo Hoat was cut.  He is one of the characters who will probably best translate across from book to TV.
3018	Arkash	2012-05-23	Yeah, well, I have my doubts for Vargo, as much as I'd love him to be there, he can be cut and replaced by others... you know, like Roose takes Harrenhal next season and some dudes pass over to him (like Polliver and some of Gregor's men) and those men are the one to cut Jaime's hand off...
Then, I was thinking, maybe they will not want to rebuild Harrenhal next season so they will do Jaime in Harrenhal in episode 10. I doubt it, but for budgetary reasons it would be better.
3019	Conchobar	2012-05-23	I saw a clip of Stannis landing on the beach and running. Was this on the other side of the blackwater? I doubt it because i know he wasn't directly invovled in the combat at the walls, that would have been stupid. Anyone have any idea?
3020	Fred Stark	2012-05-23	I dont think we will have any Arya,Dany and Robb scenes.So most of the scenes would be Lannisters and Baratheon only.
As much I want to see the epic battle scenes,I relly hope the producers will keep the Cersei and Sansa scenes.
This is what I hope and looking forward in the coming episode
1)Pre war scenes- How the King's Landings reacts to the upcoming war-Tyrion and Shae,Sansa praying,hopefully some Davos mathos father son scene
2)during war-epic wildfire scene,Sansa Cersei Janos Slynt scene,Hound afraid of fire,Some Tyrells scenes
					- Hound Sansa scenes,Tyrion betrayed,Mathos dying
3021	Dornish Bannerman	2012-05-23	Does this mean we will see Garlan Tyrell? He was the one who led the forces who came down on the attackers. Also really nice how they covered up the fact that Tywin was going to King's Landing and not the Westerlands. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />.
And, man, I like the scene where Stannis lands and says "Come with me and take this city." So badass /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />.
This episode is bound to be the best there is, yet.
3022	Samalander	2012-05-23	As for the final episode, it is quite confirmed by the only summary we have of it that we will have a fight scene with Brienne and Jaime, dunno if it will go as far as the chopped hand but who knows ?If she chops off his hand they can never develop their relationship later to the extent it should be.

3023	mpbarnes	2012-05-23	Smart money is on Loras wearing Renly's armor, makes for much better TV and gives Loras a chance to avenge Renly in a way he wasn't allowed earlier.I'm hoping Vargo isn't cast, stereotypical lisping foreign villian, this show can do better with what it's got.  Roose is clearly taking his sweet time, hasn't gotten orders to leave yet, so the switch is pushed back too.  Very possible that Rorge might give the order to cut off Jaime's hand, he's certainly up for it.  Anyone could give the order, as long as it's not Roose or Brienne, neither of them doing it makes any sense whatsoever.I'm hoping we get a scene or two of other places, really hoping Doreah shows up to return a bigger Drogon to Dany (now that he's out of his little cages and eating all the time, he's grown just like what they mention in the books) and we see her going up the steps to the HOTU at the end.  As much as I love the Battle of Blackwater Bay, it will be odd to not have any updates on other plotlines for a full episode.  Then again, the action could be so good we'll never even remember the other lines until we get the preview.[update] When I noticed someone posting a new summary for Ep. 10, I went to same site and noticed something interesting.  When you look at the cast for "Blackwater" it does appear that we'll at least get a bit of Jon Snow's storyline.  Other episodes appear to have cast listed specific to the episode.  This one features almost exclusively KL/Blackwater related people, except Jon Snow and Ygritte.  If nothing more, perhaps Ghost will FINALLY show up and cause a little havoc to free Halfhand and Jon, so we get our proper closing for that story line in Ep. 10?http://www.tv.com/sh...kwater-2385432/

3024	Dacie	2012-05-23	I just re-read the Blackwater scenes this week and I am so freakin' excited!
I agree that Loras will probably wear Renly's armor.
I really hope we get an all Kings Landing episode.
I do think they will include the chain, and they've been keeping it a secret to surprise non-book fans.
Really looking forward to the scenes in Maegors, between Cersei, Sansa, the other ladies.
I wonder who will be coming in to inform Cersei of news about the battle, since as far as I know the Kettleblacks aren't cast and haven't even been mentioned. Probably just extras in Lannister guard attire.
I think Tywin left Harrenhal to ride for Kings Landing. He doesn't need to worry about Robb anymore because he is already in cahoots with Roose Bolton and knows that it's about to hit the fan in Robb's camp. I can see that as a big shocker to non-readers....they think Stannis has won the battle, and then here comes Tywin Lannister with all the force of Highgatden!
Also, I cannot wait to see Joffrey cut himself on the Iron Throne. That is such a great scene. Here he is, announcing these war heroes and handing out honors, and then gets a scratch and starts screaming for his mother. I don't think we'll get it this episode or even in the finale, though. It seems to me it would be a good opening scene for the first episode of next season, a good way to recap the battle for everyone.
3025	Morvran	2012-05-23	I do think they will include the chain, and they've been keeping it a secret to surprise non-book fans.Except the surprise would be more like, "WTF?  Am I that horrible a viewer that I completely missed ANY hint to a giant chain being hauled up out of the deep?"  It doesn't make sense to include the chain anymore b/c they haven't even hinted towards it.  If it was already part of the city defense then why wasn't it mentioned and it wouldn't work b/c Stannis would know about it, and if it was created for the battle it would be silly to not hint towards it.  It would look to non-readers like HBO literally pulled a chain out of it's arse.  The 'surprise' will be something to follow along the hints they've given and which are in the 'previously of GoT' clips...wildfire, pig shit, and the sewers.
3026	baxter	2012-05-23	They noted Sansa and the queen in the hall about to drink the poison, so I think they will focus almost 100% tonight on all the events around Kings Landing (though I'm kind of ticked they haven't mentioned the chain once).  If they just all of a sudden go, oh yeah we have that chain! I'm going to barf.
I like Vargo, but do you really see him popping up in the next two episodes?  I don't think so.  As far as season 3 Harrenhall, if I'm them I just keep shooting those scenes as needed so they don't have to deal with set costs again.
3027	gogorath	2012-05-23	Except the surprise would be more like, "WTF? Am I that horrible a viewer that I completely missed ANY hint to a giant chain being hauled up out of the deep?"

The 'surprise' will be something to follow along the hints they've given and which are in the 'previously of GoT' clips...wildfire, pig shit, and the sewers.I think you're right if they have Tyrion say "I've prepared this special thing I've said nothing about."  That said, a chain barring entrance into a bay is not a particularly unknown or novel defense mechanism, and it wouldn't seem odd to have Davos wonder why the chain isn't up (just like say, a drawbridge isn't up) and have his noble captains speed by stupidly into the trap.  In other words, if the chain is there and is portrayed as a normal defense mechanism and the *trick* is merely to use it to keep people in rather than out, I think it is accepted by the audience.  It's only Tyrion's idea to use it novelly, not to create it.That said, I think the trick will revolve around those ships packed with wildfire that some of Stannis' captains ram.
3028	Morvran	2012-05-23	That said, I think the trick will revolve around those ships packed with wildfire that some of Stannis' captains ram.Yep...and what a horrible memory I have, I completely forgot about the listing boat full of jars.  I need to re-read heh.
3029	jlk7e	2012-05-23	I wonder who will be coming in to inform Cersei of news about the battle, since as far as I know the Kettleblacks aren't cast and haven't even been mentioned. Probably just extras in Lannister guard attire. I think Tywin left Harrenhal to ride for Kings Landing. He doesn't need to worry about Robb anymore because he is already in cahoots with Roose Bolton and knows that it's about to hit the fan in Robb's camp.I would guess that if a messenger from the battlefield is needed, Lancel will fill that role.  And I don't see why we would assume Tywin is already in cahoots with Roose Bolton.
3030	Ciglon	2012-05-23	[update] When I noticed someone posting a new summary for Ep. 10, I went to same site and noticed something interesting. When you look at the cast for "Blackwater" it does appear that we'll at least get a bit of Jon Snow's storyline. Other episodes appear to have cast listed specific to the episode. This one features almost exclusively KL/Blackwater related people, except Jon Snow and Ygritte. If nothing more, perhaps Ghost will FINALLY show up and cause a little havoc to free Halfhand and Jon, so we get our proper closing for that story line in Ep. 10? http://www.tv.com/sh...kwater-2385432/hmm, it does seem like we'll be getting 1 or 2 scenes with jon and ygritte then at least according to tv.com...I think this makes sense so that viewers will have something to really look forward to in the finale aside from dany/winterfell/a bit of arya resolution. I don't think the small comment the halfhand made to jon really sufficed to let the viewers know what the plan is for jon, they need to reiterate that jon is going to have to try and infiltrate the wildling camp by turning cloak, just a small scene next episode will remind/inform the tv-only viewers of that and really get them excited to see his resolution in the finale.
3031	CrypticWeirwood	2012-05-23	The aftermath of the Battle of the Blackwater sees the winner reward his followers while Tyrion finds himself in a strange situation. In Winterfell, Maester Luwin has some final advice for Theon. In Harrenhall, Jaqen H'ghar gives Arya a gift, and Dany visits a wondrous place in Qarth.So theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve upped the ante from strange to wondrous?  I wonder what wonders theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll reveal?

3033	Tony Soprano	2012-05-23	I'm so excited for this episode!
The previews look great. Very action packed, but it also has most of the scenes and dialogues from the book. It's even better that GRRM was the one writing it.
I still hope the chain is featured in the episode. It's the thing that makes Tyrion a great tactician. 
And when I saw Stannis lead the Baratheon charge I got goosebumps. That should be very awesome...
But, IIRC, wasn't Stannis commaning from the back of his army?
3034	Ciglon	2012-05-23	Explain me then why Jon and Ygritte are not in the 'previously on' segment for next episode?I don't think they'd have to be to just show one captivity scene, even one where nothing happens except dialogue maybe in the end...That is a good point and it has me seriously doubting whether or not we'll see any jon scenes at all for that reason, but still, I don't think it's impossible, and hope they do show at least a small scene. Also, as counterpoint, why does tv.com (admittedly, not a fullproof source like HBO themselves) show that jon (kit harington) is appearing in epiosode 9 if he is not? Looking through the other episodes listed on their site, they don't seem to be wrong about who's going to appear in what episodes up to this point.ETA: typos.

But I really do think Tywin is heading for Kings Landing. Like someone supposed a few pages back, he may be pulling a trick like Robb where he sends only a small force to battle in the Riverlands and takes the majority of his host south. He is heralded as one of the great heroes of the battle at the end of the book, which causes a further rift between him and Tyrion, as Tyrion feels he's more responsible for saving the city and gets little to no recognition.

But of course he's headed to King's Landing.

Tyrion saved the city and this will be easier transmitted on TV if the Tywin factor is taken out of the equation. The tyrells will mob up the remnants of stannis' army. Tywin is fighting Robb and Robb gets injured but wins the battle. This sets up Robb getting 'nursed' by what's her name and further establishes the reputation of the undefeated young wolf.I also think Tyrion will keep his nose but will sustain another, less visible injury, maybe an ear.

Otherwise it was a waste of time to introduce the guy in the first episode.

3047	madman2711	2012-05-23	Stannis maybe wasn"t in the vanguard but he landed on the shore of blackwater rush and commanded his men on land
He isn't Tywin to stay far behind the battlefront in the safe zone

It is clear, and should be made clear that Stannis would take the city before the reinforcement vanguard charges in. Stannis' own troops begin fighting among one another and switch sides. All big factors in Tyrion, Davos and Stannis' psychological state going into the next season.

3049	Istari	2012-05-23	I think they included Dontos in this season as another excuse to display Joff's sadistic cruelty
With so much to include within the final two episodes, I doubt they will bother with the Sansa/Dontos story

There's really no point in introducing a character that will play a prominent role in the future only to have him not appear the rest of that season.
3051	jlk7e	2012-05-23	I'm fairly confident that Tywin is heading for King's Landing and that Dontos will make an appearance in the finale.

3055	madman2711	2012-05-23	You're right. I'm wondering how he will escape from King's Landing when he is fighting in the front lines.Actually his army was on both shores of Blackwater Rush and was almost inside the walls of KL when GRRM punished him for his arrogance of keeping Hottie Mellisandre in her cold lonely bed on Dragonstone And his army was divided on both sides of the BW river so he retreated on the saan ships with help from the bastard of the nightsong rearguard
3056	Warden of the North121	2012-05-23	I know people have been saying they may keep the chain as a surprise but this would just seem too  Deus ex machina"ish" for the non book readers.

3057	Ser Dermett Corbray	2012-05-23	I really, really can't see the chain making an appearance at this point. They could say that the chain has always been there but then surely Stannis would have considered this?
The wildfire will be the key element that changes the course of the battle. Because it burns on water it will mean escape will be harder for the ships closer to the shore. Some ships will flee, many more will burn and the soldiers who made the shore (who are threatening to overpower Tyrion's gate) will be crushed by Tywin. That's how I see the battle going.
3058	Harrad	2012-05-23	Is it the consensus that Tywin takes Stannis from the rear (an unappetizing prospect), rather than Loras et al? I don't get the preoccupation with the chain. As stated above, "wildfire will be the key element," not to mention the ghostly "appearance" of Renly (perhaps). Will the last two episodes finish book 2 completely, forge into book 3, or...?
3059	Harrad	2012-05-23	And speaking of Tywin in battle...Did he deliberately mislead Arya saying he was going West and then go East? If so he must have been reading ahead in the script.
3060	Ciglon	2012-05-23	Is it the consensus that Tywin takes Stannis from the rear (an unappetizing prospect), rather than Loras et al? I don't get the preoccupation with the chain. As stated above, "wildfire will be the key element," not to mention the ghostly "appearance" of Renly (perhaps). Will the last two episodes finish book 2 completely, forge into book 3, or...?I agree with you on the chain part, it would be too confusing for non-book viewers and not really necessary with the adaptation they've made of the story so far. I think most POVs pretty much hit the mark and end on book 2, perhaps daenerys might not meet strong belwas + barristan but that's maybe the only thing that might be pushed towardfs next season. I doubt they have enough time in 2 episodes to merge into ASOS and besides, ACOK leaves off at a very good point to end the series on as well.EDIT: also, when did tywin tell arya he's moving west? He said the young wolf is at our heels and I want to go on the move, he never said anything about moving to go meet robb, it could (and most likely) means that he is moving east to avoid robb's forces and to reach KL.

3064	Yago	2012-05-23	He was going to meet Robb. But Edmure stopped his army at one of those rivers, and words of Stannis' approach of King's Landing reached him, causing him to turn to the east again, to save King's Landing.

Probably. Thanks for the explication. So after the battle the Lannister family reunion can occur at KL. They could really speed up things there if they wanted.
3066	thegoat506	2012-05-23	A bit OT but I was wondering if anyone else thinks that having the Mel/Stannis leeches ceremony as the last scene of the season would be a great cliff hanger. I know its a bit out of chronology, but I remember not taking it too seriously on my first read through of the series and I think the same effect would occure by making people wait 10 months before the story resumes and having several episodes that don't seem to be tied to the spell at all.

Thought perhaps too spoilery?More likely it's the horn blowing one...two...three.
3068	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-23	A bit OT but I was wondering if anyone else thinks that having the Mel/Stannis leeches ceremony as the last scene of the season would be a great cliff hanger. I know its a bit out of chronology, but I remember not taking it too seriously on my first read through of the series and I think the same effect would occure by making people wait 10 months before the story resumes and having several episodes that don't seem to be tied to the spell at all.The last scene has got to be Bran's "broken, but not dead" line as he looks back at a destroyed Winterfell. It has got to be that.The leech burning might make a fine cliffhanger in one of the early S3 episodes, since Stannis will (presumably) disappear for a few after his total defeat.
3069	Valkyrja	2012-05-23	I'd love Bran's 'broken but not dead' line to be included.....would be perfect. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
That said, I personally hope that the three horn blasts will be the last scene......complete with a view of some Others.....er, 'White Walkers'. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
I think it would be great to have an Ice-finale to contrast with the Fire-finale (dragons) last season. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
3070	WillWork4NinjaPowers	2012-05-23	Tywin shows up, is next to a dude in Antlers.  Helm comes off, we see Loras.  Tyrion is injured.  Wakes up, everyone is talking about how Tywin saved everyone.  Tyrion gets pissed.  Sansa runs into Dontos after the battle, maybe in the Red Keep.  He tells her he is going to save her.  That's my guess for that part.

Grenn, Dolorous Edd and Sam all talking atop the mountain. The commander walking around in the background. Reaction of a non-book reader:"Well this is a bit tame... a bit dull... they're talking about turnips again... hmmm... a horn? wait, what? ...oh...OH.... OH SHIT NO! SHIT!!!"
3072	Arkash	2012-05-23	I'm quite sure Sallador and Tywin will appear this episode. And even Dontos to finish Sansa's arc on a good note with the promise, but on episode 10. We shall see Loras Tyrell too, according to the casting ! Great, I am glad to know the show will show the Tyrell / Lannister arrival, can be epic !
And predictions: Mathos will die in the battle (not a prediction but something obvious I know), and Davos' arc will end on episode 10 with him being put in jail by Melisandre's men for trying to kill her.
3073	Ser Dermett Corbray	2012-05-23	And predictions: Mathos will die in the battle (not a prediction but something obvious I know), and Davos' arc will end on episode 10 with him being put in jail by Melisandre's men for trying to kill her.Mathos is a given yeah. But do you really think they'll jump that far forward with Davos story? How will they achieve that? I suppose they could have him and Stannis far of from the action. Davos confronts her when it looks like it has failed and is thrown in a jail on the ship.But I think him "drowning" amidst all the wildfire would be a nice cliffhanger for that character. Finding him at the start of season 3 washed up, dishevelled and starving.
3074	Arkash	2012-05-23	Yeah, but I remembered Liam Cunnigham saying something like "Melisandre throws Davos in a cell", somewhere... so I'm assuming we will have a scene on last episode where Davos is rescued by a ship and a second one where he arrives at Dragonstone to kill Melisandre and is taken by the guards...
3075	DragonAge93	2012-05-23	Yeah, I remember reading that, too. Though I think Carice van Houten said it, that she throws Davos into a cell, so I assume this would be episode 10, as she said she appears in episode 10 as well. I hope they don't try to cram too much of Davos into the finale, because I think having him floating in the Blackwater would be a great arc finale for him, and will leave the audience wondering if he survived.
3076	Ser Dermett Corbray	2012-05-23	Good call actually. We've already had one "oh shit, did they just die?" moment with Bran/Rickon this season. With all the people who are likely to be killed off during the battle, I think having Davos "drown" in the battle and then wash up at the start of episode 10 could work. Would be a lot more surprising for the non-readers too.
3077	Darth Pipes	2012-05-23	Tywin shows up, is next to a dude in Antlers.  Helm comes off, we see Loras.  Tyrion is injured.  Wakes up, everyone is talking about how Tywin saved everyone.  Tyrion gets pissed.  Sansa runs into Dontos after the battle, maybe in the Red Keep.  He tells her he is going to save her.  That's my guess for that part.Loras wearing Renly's armor/crown would make perfect sense for the show.Also for the show, Stannis has to be on the front lines and I'm glad he is.I think Sallador will be there too, I hope.I think Ser Dontos will pop up before the end of the season, setting up his storyline next season.  I think they should have shown him sooner because for the non-tv viewer, it's going to be odd when he suddenly pops up again.  To be honest though, I thought the actor who played Dontos was horribe in the season premeire.As for the finale, we'll have the House of the Undying, the Jon/Qhorin duel, possibly the Jaime/Brienne duel, more Arya and Jaqen and probably some cliffhangers.  It should be an action-packed finale.
3078	SerMixalot	2012-05-23	I'm sure something similar happened in the book. When Tywin left Harrenhal, I think we as readers assumed he was going on the offensive against Robb.

3079	The Unborn	2012-05-23	I believe Tywin said he was going to meet Robb in battle but really was going to King's Landing to fight off Stannis, in case some spies were around listening.
3080	StarkWard	2012-05-23	I just want to see the flaming arrows.
3081	Harrad	2012-05-24	Someone compared the battle of KL to Helms Deep. Can 10 years of CGI development offset the huge budget disparity? We shall see on Sunday.
3082	Lord Elrosir	2012-05-24	Won't even be close.  D&amp;D already admitted it wouldn't be in the same ballpark as Helm's Deep.
It should be fun as hell though!

3083	victim	2012-05-24	What really made Helm's Deep perfect for me though is the impending doom and that horrid gut-feeling of knowing that some of your favourite characters may die pretty soon. The battle itself should be amazing but I think the most important scenes of the entire episode should be Cersei and Sansa's suicide pact and something involving Tyrion (I dread this because it'll probably be a scene with Shae). I think the set-up to the battle is just as important because I want people to fear for their favourite characters the same way I did on the first read-through. I certainly want it to seem as if Davos and Stannis
However, much like Helm's Deep, nobody of true importance dies. There should be a great scene between Davos and Mathos though before the battle begins for that death to truly hit home.
3084	Xray the Enforcer	2012-05-24	[mod] Discuss the show, not each other. This includes, but is not limited to: people who love the show, people who hate the show, and Sansa/Sandor fans. Thank you. [/mod]
3085	Arkash	2012-05-24	Helm's Deep was nice, but with no soul... to shoot a battle properly, you have to shoot it down the ground, among the men fighting, retranscribe the Fog of War... it's not about helicopters epic shots or complicated camera movments, it's about being close humanly to the character. And from what I gathered around, D&D seem to be on my side for this, so I'm glad.
One thing bothering me for the battle: I'm quite sure they will pass Tyrion for dead until following episode, and all the people are gonna discuss for a week is "Is Tyrion alive ?", while there will be so much in the episode.
3086	sennahoj	2012-05-24	Whether the chain makes an appearance or not (it's not really clear from that shadow on the promo picture), what the preview made quite clear was that Tyrion masterminds and directs the defence of King's Landing, giving rousing battle speeches etc. So even if his genius chain plan from the book is scrapped, we will still get a feeling of the injustice done to Tyrion after the battle, since - chain or not - he saved King's Landing but gets no credit for it. I believe that major point about the battle of the blackwater will come across in the two final episodes.
3087	madman2711	2012-05-24	Idk if Tyrion could win by himself and only with his troops 
He might save some time and stall the breaching of the gates but Stannis would have win nonetheless if the Tyrell - Tywin army didnt came to the rescue
I only feel sorry for Salhador Saan as Cersei would have been dead before he could woo her /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />)

3089	jlk7e	2012-05-24	If not for Tyrion, the city would have been taken and Cersei and Joffrey would have been dead by the time Tywin and Mace arrived.  Both components were necessary for a meaningful victory.
3090	madman2711	2012-05-24	/agree.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':agree:' />
yet the fact he was quite unpopular to the masses and also with his family and allies made Tywin and Tyrell the saviours in the eye of the KL-ers
i still know tthe truth so i don't mind
3091	Reposado	2012-05-24	If not for Tyrion, the city would have been taken and Cersei and Joffrey would have been dead by the time Tywin and Mace arrived. Both components were necessary for a meaningful victory.in the book yes, but in the show, doubt it. boot tyrion was planning for the defense of the city throughout the book. show tyrion didnt start thinking about it till the eve of the battleI believe in the book he was on the move to robb, he fought edmure at the crossings and heard of the tyrell alliance so rushed to KL.yes, but he left harrenhall so much earlier in the book. in the show, he remained at harrenhall for the entire time that book bolton held it

Wouldn't she also have to travel at relativistic speeds for that?
3095	CrypticWeirwood	2012-05-24	in the book yes, but in the show, doubt it. boot tyrion was planning for the defense of the city throughout the book. show tyrion didnt start thinking about it till the eve of the battle yes, but he left harrenhall so much earlier in the book.Thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not true.  You donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know what he was doing.  He obviously talked to the pyromancers a lot earlier. This urban legend that Tyrion didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t start worrying about how to save the city until two days before the attack is completely bogus.Why must all the purissimistas keeps interpreting in  the worst possible way each and little thing they see â<U+0080><U+0094> or donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see â<U+0080><U+0094> in the show?  Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s ridiculous and annoying both.  Plus thereâ<U+0080><U+0099>s no evidence for it, either. All we know from what the show is actually showing is that Tyrion first began thinking about defending the city quite a long time ago, and that even as late as two days prior to the attack, that he continued to worry about it.  What, you think he should turn into Joffrey, and become complacent and confident in victory  despite having no reason to believe in that outcome?  Rubbish!  Tyrion is way smarter than that, which is exactly what the last episode showed.  Good for them! What the show showed of Tyrion is completely appropriate, and moreover is in perfect accord with the book.  The sky is not falling,  Chicken Little Cassandra, for Troy shall not fall!Moreover, Tyrion has no reason to believe that his father and the Tyrells will show up to save the day.  His father hasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t told him a damned thing about whatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s doing on, and the last he heard of the Tyrells, they were siding with Renly against Joffrey.  Tyrion through Varys has received nothing but highly conflicting reports of what happened at and after Renlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s assassination; he certainly hasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t gotten word from the Tyrells that theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve changed allegiances to support the Lannisters.  Tyrion therefore has every reason to continue to worry, so itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s good that he does so, for it would be anti-book and anti-reason to do otherwise.  Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s great that the writers knew to follow the book in this matter.  The show is being realistic about Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s concerns still being excruciatingly pressing ones even at such a late date, as he continues to scour the lorebooks for any possible insight that might be hidden their. Heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s desperate for a break, because he knows he needs it, or else all his lost. Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s frantic worry is not violating the book; rather,  it is confirming it.

3097	Valkyrja	2012-05-24	[mod] Discuss the show, not each other. This includes, but is not limited to: people who love the show, people who hate the show, and Sansa/Sandor fans. Thank you. [/mod]Noted. That particular discussion has moved to a more appropriate thread. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />But anyhoo.......despite all my reservations that I've listed ad nauseum here and in other threads, I am getting very excited for the Blackwater episode now. I am really looking forward to seeing an episode that takes place (mostly) in one location. So far, this seems to be to have been Season 2's biggest weakness.....the storylines have skipped around too quickly.....even for a reader of the books!It would be nice if for next season they had time to linger a bit longer in each episode with fewer characters. Unfortunately, though, the cast only gets larger next season....so we shall see. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
3098	Harrad	2012-05-24	I was intitially disappointed that HBO did not show the behind-the-scenes negotiations that led to the crucial shift of alliances before the battle of KL. Or at least hint at them. Although I guess its for the same reason the GRRM left them out. To shock the hell out the readers/watchers.
3099	Harrad	2012-05-24	Helm's Deep was nice, but with no soul... to shoot a battle properly, you have to shoot it down the ground, among the men fighting, retranscribe the Fog of War... it's not about helicopters epic shots or complicated camera movments, it's about being close humanly to the character. And from what I gathered around, D&D seem to be on my side for this, so I'm glad. One thing bothering me for the battle: I'm quite sure they will pass Tyrion for dead until following episode, and all the people are gonna discuss for a week is "Is Tyrion alive ?", while there will be so much in the episode.There were plenty of down on the ground shots in Helms Deep. Gimli's infamous dwarf-tossing moment for one. Helm's Deep was full of blue-eyed and Elvish soul.
3100	Crown	2012-05-24	A friend of mine, non-book reader told me today: 'I'm sure Stannis is going to lose, otherwise the story would basically be over. With Stannis on the throne Robb would have none to fight against.'
3101	Darth Pipes	2012-05-24	Mmmm... yummy relativistic time travel! Nice! /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />Heheh.  One person who doesn't have a time machine is Ramsay.  Two episodes ago his father sent word to him to take Winterfell and he STILL hasn't arrived yet.  And he probably won't by the end of the season.  He needs to be a Bastard to the Future. /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />If Tyrion doesn't end up with a scar, then I imagine he'll be stabbed.  Just a guess.

3103	DurararaFTW	2012-05-24	Weren't they hinted at by Littlefinger's discussion with Tywin?Yeah, I'm kinda glad they put it a few episodes back actually, make it seem something only the most observant will see coming.

This urban legend that Tyrion didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t start worrying about how to save the city until two days before the attack is completely bogus.That's true, it's hyperbole to say Tyrion doesn't start worrying about it until 2 days before.  But he actually doesn't start worrying about it until about ep 5, after learning Renly is dead, where he has a conversation with Cersei who refuses to tell him anything about the plans for defense.  It's at this time that it suddenly occurs to him that the city is going to be attacked.  What did he think Renly was going to do, throw a gay pride parade and go back to Storm's End?  I can live with what it does to Tyrion, so long as he doesn't pull something out of his ass in 2 days that would have taken much longer to actually do.  But it really hurt the season to not be building towards Blackwater the way they should have.
3108	Harrad	2012-05-24	Weren't they hinted at by Littlefinger's discussion with Tywin?Yes, to the effect that here's some stuff we could do including the appeal to Catelyn that worked regardless of the stupidity involved. However, at the time Renly was the main threat so the machinations regarding the Tyrells could not have been considered.
3109	Catastrophy	2012-05-24	One thing bothering me for the battle: I'm quite sure they will pass Tyrion for dead until following episode, and all the people are gonna discuss for a week is "Is Tyrion alive ?", while there will be so much in the episode.Don't think they can do it (can try) because there is *Tyrion wakes up to new situation* in ep10 summary.
3110	scurvy	2012-05-24	I'm hoping the entire episode follows Stannis' ground attack; Tyrion's defense; Sansa/Cersei in the Red Keep; The Onion Knight on the Blackwater.  Keep out of the Westerlands/Riverlands/North/North of the Wall entirely.  I'm prepared to be either awed or disappointed.

And yes tyrion seems more about geting back at Cersei then defending the city 
I mean the pigshit/ wildfire comes from his spying Cersei ( just as in the book) but he wasnt looking for the defense just stumbed on wilfire
3116	Darth Pipes	2012-05-24	is this it http://i.imgur.com/gyBGGl.jpg He looks awesome in this picture.Bronn, Prince of Thieves.  Or sellswords.That scene with Sansa and Joffrey must be where he has her kiss his sword and she tries to goad him into fighting because that's what Robb does.

3121	SerCrickard	2012-05-24	I haven't posted on here in quite a while so thought i'd add to the discussion!
This episode is going to be immense! I'm off on holidays tomorrow and i'm more exited about GoT on Monday night.
I worked as an extra in the Blackwater battle scene and it was the most fun i've had at any job i've ever done. So much work went into the parts of the scene i was in and it look awesome from my POV but from the short clips we've seen in the trailers it'll look 100 times better with the added VFX and sound etc.
I only read a few pages of this thread but i do know the answers to a few questions you've asked but i'll not spoil anything! Don't know about the chain though, hope it is included but i couldn't see if as they'd probably have included Tyrion talking to the smiths in the run up to the battle asking them to make the chain. Then again it could just appear out of nowhere! I think there will be plenty of wildfire though, i heard a lot of talk on set of things like "all this area here will be burning and explosions etc"
There are a few great scenes in the battle including the Hound kicking ass which i can't wait to see on screen! Hope i'll be able to spot myself somewhere within all the madness that'll be going on.

3132	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-25	I'm worried about Bronn in the next episode. Got a horrible, horrible feeling he may go the way or Irri and Rakharo.I think Bronn still has an important role to play later on when Tyrion returns to Westeros (and tries to claim Casterly Rock?).
3133	Neddy	2012-05-25	From the teaser trailer: Anybody else find it funny text: "ONLY TWO EPISODES LEFT" Joffrey "THERE'Si»<U+00BF> TOO MANY!" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REPbX77VILMThe Joffery thing was actually the only thing I didn't like from the trailer- it felt forced as if it was only put in their to make Jofferey look weak and appease the viewers by making him appear scared/slash cowardly- particularly after that scene in episode 8 where he boasts about giving Stannis "a big red smile from ear to ear" he should be a lot more arrogant cocky and self assured.Rest of it looks insane though and I reckon having it in the dark will only add to it

Read: Harrenhall is nearly 400 miles away from Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing, and Stannis was only two days away when Tywin rode out. Thus Tywin cannot be more than two days away either. Which means just one thing... House Lannister must finally be deploying their famous griffin-and-pegasus squadron. Itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the only possible way for them to get there in time. This is going to make Littlefingerâ<U+0080><U+0099>s teleportation tricks look like childâ<U+0080><U+0099>s play.  Go Tywin, go! The HBO show does not adhere to niceties like distances and time of travel.Tywin stated he is riding out against Robb's army and in the war council in regards to KL, his statements pointed to he expected them to hold and nothing about a relief rescue. In all the time and distance is very unclear.  On the inverse end of how quickly people arrrive, Alton <sp?> was given Robb's term and sent to KL in the 1st episode, he arrives and delivers them by episode 2, and yet does not arrive back until the 7th episode.  During this time, catayln goes to and from Storm's End.  LF does KL to Storm's End to Harranhall and may very well gone to High Garden to get theTyrell's to side with the Lannisters when Alton with his Northern captors got back.
3145	madman2711	2012-05-25	Maybe some days last longer than others in tv show westeros as do seasons last years 
Anyhow i dont think that this is the biggest problem if the series IMO
3146	SerMixalot	2012-05-25	hope Lancel survivesi cant wait for the Hound meltdownLancel has important parts to play in the future story.
3147	CrypticWeirwood	2012-05-25	To be honest, Blackwater is not the episode I'm awaiting the most... it's gonna be a nice one, for sure, but damn, I so canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t wait to see the finale: Valar Morghulis.Certainly itâ<U+0080><U+0099>llâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve been the episode youâ<U+0080><U+0099>llâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve waited the most time for, thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s for sure. But yeah, I know what you mean.  As far as I can tell, the last episode will have to fit all of these critical elements into it â<U+0080><U+0094> somehow:Dany at the House of the Undying, and its aftermath, and perhaps also her departure from Qarth probably  on the ship Jorah found, quite possibly probably without yet meeting up with Magister Illyrioâ<U+0080><U+0099>s envoys, Strong Belwas and now-Squire Artsan nA© Barristan. Xaro Xhoan Daxos somehow getting his comeuppance for betraying Dany and the opening and reveal of whatever if anything is actually locked away in  Chekovâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Treasure Vault; does this fund Danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s expedition to Slaverâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Bay? The Sack of Winterfell by the Bastardâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Boys, including Theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s capture and either imprisonment or apparent death.Bran and Rickonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s departure from the crypt, including meeting Luwin one last time, and probably the two boys somehow getting split up; how to do this unless Luwin is to survive the sack I have no idea. Arya receiving the iron coin and the special phrase â<U+0080><U+009C>Valar Morghulisâ<U+0080><U+009D> from Jaqen. Tyrion awakening in his sick bed to discover that he is no longer hand and that his father the conquering hero has stolen all Tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s glory for having rescued Kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Landing.Something for Sansa linking her to the next season, possibly Margaery replacing her as Joffreyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s betrothed. Jon killing Qhorin to join the wildings; rumour is that we get a glimpse of giants here. Davos getting rescued from the Spears of the Merling King by Salladhor Sam and thrown into the dungeon at Dragonstone by Melisandre.Some kind of link to the next season for the Robb and Catelyn arc. Some kind of link to the next season for the Jaime and Brienne arc.That seems like a huge whole lot to try to cover even in one long 64-minute episode (its supposed running time). I fear all that means that we wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t be getting anything like as much of #1 as we might all like to see, but Emila Clarke has said in an interview that fans of the books would not be disappointed by  the dramatic resolution to her plot arc this season. One hopes sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s right about that.

3148	Lord Balbi	2012-05-25	Just two points:
1) I think that if HBO intended to use Renly's "ghost" they would make his armor more memorable for the viewers by making us see him wearing the full set, specially the helmet since it would cover this face. Thats's the idea right? The soldiers looking at that amazing armor and just running for their lives. If HBO have to add someone screaming "Oh No, that's Renly's ghost!" to explain who is that for the viewers it just doesn't seem right.
2) They released the 2nd season soundtrack and the last song is called "three horns". I guess that's the final scene for the season. I love the "broken" scene and I wan't to see it but the "three horns" is more powerful to end it exploading the viewer's heads.
3149	Thwacker	2012-05-25	I know that i'm gonna get a lot of hate for this but... GRRM is not that great of a writer himself you know. I like the series as a whole but he's not even in my top ten writers of all time .It's all a matter of taste, of course. Still, after studying classics/literature at University and not being a fan at all of this genre, I find GRRM to be a fantastic writer. Aside from perhaps Dostoyevsky, I can't think of another author whose writing barely has an extra or unnecessary word. It amazes me practically every word in every book is there for a specific reason, and the story would lose something with its removal.
3150	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-25	Just two points: 1) I think that if HBO intended to use Renly's "ghost" they would make his armor more memorable for the viewers by making us see him wearing the full set, specially the helmet since it would cover this face.

I guess that's the final scene for the season. I love the "broken" scene and I wan't to see it but the "three horns" is more powerful to end it exploading the viewer's heads.I agree on the second point; the three horns situation will be a great cliffhanger, especially when you know what is coming and when you see Sam's face. On your first point, however, I have to say that it's a much used tactics in series or movies which were translated from books, to use sentences to make something clear for the non-bookreaders. I mean; I know that it's gonna be Renly's armor as I'm a bookreader, but non-bookreaders need some clarification for that. It's a very common thing to do.
3151	Frumpus	2012-05-25	Goliath was a little over 6 feet tall, David was closer to 5'8"The story is a myth, so it's unnecessary to take some historian's opinion on Goliath's height as fact when that particular story only makes sense with a 9 foot tall Goliath.

It's a very common thing to do.You are right, it is a very common thing to do but I guess I just expect more from them. Or maybe they will do it in a way that will shut me up.
3153	Jamie Lannister	2012-05-25	A few spoilers from the ever-correct mystery source over on WiC:
	Spoiler Tyrion is indeed attacked by Mandon Moore, and saved by Pod; Bronn survives (contrary to rampant speculation otherwise); there's no chain in the battle; and Tyrion suffers facial damage... though it's not clear how serious.

Also, I want to see Davos and Bronn have a showdown, since I doubt the former will spend most of the battle on his ship. A battle of the badasses; a duel of the second "second-in-commands." That would be cool.
3154	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-25	Hopefully they simply won't and focus on the battle before the reinforcements arrive, since the charge wasn't 'shown' in the book either anyway, it was only described afterwards.
3155	Sirielle	2012-05-25	This is a bot OT, but:I have a feeling the chain may be in because of this article I read on EW's website. It's an interview David and Dan gave for the Blackwater episode. "Peter Brown, our sound designer, is our hero because he finally came up with the ice-cracking chatter we had in our heads when we imagined the White Walkers speaking Skroth. For Blackwater, he had to orchestrate a major naval battle and a land battle. And he had to come up with something very big and very loud, which would be a spoiler to explain but book readers will understand." To me it hints at the sound of a chain being raised.- how to understand "White Walkers speaking Skroth"? Do they mean a language of White Walkers? I've got to see the pilot once again for I never through there could be herad any kind of speech in the White Walkers scenes. I thought the ice-cracking sounds where sounds of their movement, not their speach, got to refresh WW book scenes, too.
3156	protar	2012-05-25	If the whole episode takes place in KL, I wonder if the episode opening will still zoom to Winterfell, the Wall, Qarth, etc. I'm guessing it probably will...It would be cool if we just got an extended, closer up KL section with ships sailing into the bay, catapults flinging wildfire and formations of troops lining up on the opposite shore. But probably not.
3157	Lady Sansa Stark	2012-05-25	You are right, it is a very common thing to do but I guess I just expect more from them. Or maybe they will do it in a way that will shut me up.Oh well, only two/three days until we find out. I just can't wait.
3158	jlk7e	2012-05-25	Goliath was a little over 6 feet tall, David was closer to 5'8"What is the basis for such specific figures?
3159	DirtyRobes	2012-05-25	Don't think they can do it (can try) because there is *Tyrion wakes up to new situation* in ep10 summary.Doesn't really apply seeing as the entire summery of the finale is a spoiler! Including the victor in Blackwater; 
	Spoiler  Tyrion awakens to a changed situation. King Joffrey doles out rewards to his subjects. As Theon stirs his men to action, Luwin offers some final advice. Brienne silences Jaime; Arya receives a gift from Jaqen; Dany goes to a strange place; Jon proves himself to Qhorin
The summery is blacked out on this site, but is written clearly on others. I found it very odd that its soo spoilerish!!It's all a matter of taste, of course. Still, after studying classics/literature at University and not being a fan at all of this genre, I find GRRM to be a fantastic writer. Aside from perhaps Dostoyevsky, I can't think of another author whose writing barely has an extra or unnecessary word. It amazes me practically every word in every book is there for a specific reason, and the story would lose something with its removal.Perfectly said! It was not until about 1/2 through SoS that I started realizing the importance of Each and every story he tells. After finishing all 5 I went straight back in and was even more amazed during second reading by the shear complexity of this story. I can Only imagine that GRRM pores over each sentence for weeks before he's satisfied(that doesn't please all fans of course).1) I think that if HBO intended to use Renly's "ghost" they would make his armor more memorable for the viewers by making us see him wearing the full set, specially the helmet since it would cover this face. Thats's the idea right? The soldiers looking at that amazing armor and just running for their lives. If HBO have to add someone screaming "Oh No, that's Renly's ghost!" to explain who is that for the viewers it just doesn't seem right.I have to say I definitely agree... but they Did do a little video thing about the armour were they talked up how great it looks. Seems strange they didn't bother to show Renly with it.^^^Jaimie Lannister;  I REALLY hope Atleast part of your spoiler is not true:-(

3161	jlk7e	2012-05-25	Certainly itâ<U+0080><U+0099>llâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve been the episode youâ<U+0080><U+0099>llâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve waited the most time for, thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s for sure.

Xaro's treasure vault may turn out to be no more Chekhovian than the indications that Littlefinger and Tywin were suspicious of Arya's identity.  I also think Sansa is likely going to see Dontos again, and that Bran and Rickon quite possibly won't be separated until next season.

3162	iheartseverus	2012-05-25	What is the basis for such specific figures?Because Stannis said so.
3163	Crown	2012-05-25	Perfectly said! It was not until about 1/2 through SoS that I started realizing the importance of Each and every story he tells. After finishing all 5 I went straight back in and was even more amazed during second reading by the shear complexity of this story. I can Only imagine that GRRM pores over each sentence for weeks before he's satisfied(that doesn't please all fans of course).I agree, even the 'boring' (which is the opinion of the majority of the forums, not mine) Brienne chapters have a purpose, in my opinion to show how the common people respond to the war and that's why I loved them. We had seen enough through the eyes of Queens, Hands, Lords and Sers, but none through the eyes of the common folk. I'm glad I discovered the importance of every sentence and every word aswell, because it makes the books much and much better.
3164	Darth Pipes	2012-05-25	I'm glad that Tyrion was knocked out in the show before the battle of the green fork. He's a dwarf, I have a hard time believing he is a formidable warrior. That was one thing I thought was ridiculous from the books. I wonder how HBO will handle his involvement in the battle of BlackwaterI thought the scene where Tyrion is practically jumping ship to ship and killing people was ridiculous.  I agree.  This is a dwarf who is constantly described as wobbling.As for Daxos, I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up being killed.  Dany promised her khalasar that their enemies would die screaming and on the show Daxos betrayed her by stealing her dragons.  Not to mention killing some of her khalasr and Irri in the process.  Dany has to respond to that.

3165	LeggoMyEssos	2012-05-25	[*][font=georgia,serif] Xaro Xhoan Daxos somehow getting his comeuppance for betraying Dany and the opening and reveal of whatever if anything is actually locked away in Chekovâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Treasure Vault; does this fund Danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s expedition to Slaverâ<U+0080><U+0099>s Bay?I would assume the vault is opened at some point this season - if you watch the HBO GO interactive features, they went to extensive detail in designing the vault, and the key around his neck actually does in fact open the vault.  Seems like a lot of design & construction expense for something that never comes into play on-air.
3166	mpbarnes	2012-05-25	Just two points: 1) I think that if HBO intended to use Renly's "ghost" they would make his armor more memorable for the viewers by making us see him wearing the full set, specially the helmet since it would cover this face.

I guess that's the final scene for the season. I love the "broken" scene and I wan't to see it but the "three horns" is more powerful to end it exploading the viewer's heads.I'm hoping we see Renly's Ghost. Many of Stannis' men were Renly's men, they'd recognize him.  We saw his armor on two or three occassions, all you really need is a bunch of people saying, "Renly,"  "It's Renly's Ghost"...i'm not sure why you think that wouldn't seem right, it seems like a very normal response for people to have...having Stannis hear and see the charge would make for great TV, they could even add a flashback of Renly in his armor.  No matter, should be a hell of a time.Since we just recently saw Sam find the dragonglass, I think there's a really strong chance we'll get Sam killing a white walker in this season ender...I think hearing three horns and everyone saying "Three horns...White Walkers!" and a fade to black would piss me off beyond belief.
3167	mpbarnes	2012-05-25	I would assume the vault is opened at some point this season - if you watch the HBO GO interactive features, they went to extensive detail in designing the vault, and the key around his neck actually does in fact open the vault. Seems like a lot of design & construction expense for something that never comes into play on-air.Based off of the changes, seems the smart money's on Dany killing Xaro after she burns down the HOTU, taking the key and probably opening the vault at the end of the episode.  It kind of sucks that we likely won't get a sorrowful man, but as long as HOTU is cool and Dany gets to be a badass again (Season 3 should be non-stop badassery on her part), I'll be happy.
3168	DixiesArcher	2012-05-25	That would be a cheesy cliffhanger if the episode ended with Dany opening the vault IMO
3169	Arya The Assassin	2012-05-25	I'm glad that Tyrion was knocked out in the show before the battle of the green fork. He's a dwarf, I have a hard time believing he is a formidable warrior. That was one thing I thought was ridiculous from the books. I wonder how HBO will handle his involvement in the battle of BlackwaterTyrion being knocked unconscious -- by accident and by his own men -- is even more ridiculous than him fighting in a battle (I'll explain why in the next paragraph), at least IMO. They did this for practical reasons (it would be too expensive to shoot the battle), not because they felt it was unlikely that he would survive the battle. In the books, GRRM makes a reasonable effort to show how Tyrion manages to stay alive.Besides, in a battle, a person of Tyrion's rank and importance would be well protected by a strong personal guard, such as the Gold Cloaks. It's not as if he's going engage ten enemy solders single handed, that's just stuff you see in Hollywood-films (1). And he doesn't necessarily have to be a strong, tall soldier in order to be a good commander or leader (another misconception): A good battlefield commander or tactician knows how to maneuver his military resources (men, equipment, etc.), and he knows when and where to attack or defend (timing can be crucial or decisive). A leader like this can be very important on the battlefield, even though he's a weakling, physically speaking.(1) Although I wouldn't be surprised if we see him kill a few enemy soldiers in the Blackwater episode. At least it will make him look cooler, and perhaps the writers want to compensate a bit for the fact that Tyrion was knocked out even before the battle began in season one.
3170	DirtyRobes	2012-05-25	Since we just recently saw Sam find the dragonglass, I think there's a really strong chance we'll get Sam killing a white walker in this season ender...I think hearing three horns and everyone saying "Three horns...White Walkers!" and a fade to black would piss me off beyond belief.I Really doubt it. I cant imagine a scene were all the WW start coming up and Sam just pops one in the neck before the fade to black + there's the problem that he would probably just Give the arrow heads & daggers out, the other NW can't know what the DG does. It would make the WW seem really weak to the viewer. Sorry you don't like it but I definitely think north of the wall will end with 3 horn blasts. It might be early season 3 when the watch is scattered that Sam gets his chance.P.s. I Really Hate Uruk-haiWhiteWalkers
3171	The Frostfangs	2012-05-25	Besides, in a battle, a person of Tyrion's rank and importance would be well protected by a strong personal guard, such as the Gold Cloaks.The problem with this is that Tywin put him in the vanguard with a bunch of hill tribesmen. Not exactly adequate protection. ( I do realise this is in the show and he gets knocked out)
3172	The Frostfangs	2012-05-25	I Really doubt it.

It might be early season 3 when the watch is scattered that Sam gets his chance. P.s.

You don't need a vault for that. I'm just worried this whole thing is building to absolutely nothing. What could possibly be in there to benefit her story?Spitball?

3180	CrypticWeirwood	2012-05-25	I would assume the vault is opened at some point this season - if you watch the HBO GO interactive features, they went to extensive detail in designing the vault, and the key around his neck actually does in fact open the vault. Seems like a lot of design & construction expense for something that never comes into play on-air.My thinking exactly.  They would never have wasted so much money and time building and presenting something that weâ<U+0080><U+0099>d never see again, especially something that isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t even in the books at all. It must have a real purpose, still unrevealed.
3181	Arya The Assassin	2012-05-25	The problem with this is that Tywin put him in the vanguard with a bunch of hill tribesmen. Not exactly adequate protection. ( I do realise this is in the show and he gets knocked out)But that's exactly why Tywin put him there! /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> In the book, Tyrion wasn't satisfied with being put in the vanguard with a bunch of undisciplined tribesmen and raw recruits, and he suspected that Tywin did this deliberately, because he believed his father wouldn't be too unhappy if he died. Actually, Tywin expected the van to rout (and IIRC the tribesmen indeed took heavy losses).If Tywin really wanted to protect his son, he would put him under better protection with disciplined (royal) guards that he knew he could trust. There's a reason why Tywin himself was in the rear with the reserve! The reserve consisted of 2.500 mounted men and 2.500 foot, of which a signifcant amount of the cavalry (probably hundreds) would constitute Tywin's  personal guard.And like I said in the message that you just quoted from, there's a difference between what you often see in Hollywood films and TV series like GoT, and how things would work in a more correct historical context /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />
3182	StannisandDaeny	2012-05-25	I thought the scene where Tyrion is practically jumping ship to ship and killing people was ridiculous. I agree. This is a dwarf who is constantly described as wobbling.I agree and I hope this is the first thing they'll cut, at one point he's even described as entering a battle trance, slaying the one guy after the other like Jaime did... like, wtf? I understand with better armor and weapons, from horseback, he could kill a few foes, but he was genuinely kicking ass, which is just ridiculous. His fighting scenes are the only thing that genuinely pissed me off in the series.

3183	Lord Balbi	2012-05-25	I'm hoping we see Renly's Ghost. Many of Stannis' men were Renly's men, they'd recognize him. We saw his armor on two or three occassions, all you really need is a bunch of people saying, "Renly," "It's Renly's Ghost"...i'm not sure why you think that wouldn't seem right, it seems like a very normal response for people to have...having Stannis hear and see the charge would make for great TV, they could even add a flashback of Renly in his armor. No matter, should be a hell of a time. Since we just recently saw Sam find the dragonglass, I think there's a really strong chance we'll get Sam killing a white walker in this season ender...I think hearing three horns and everyone saying "Three horns...White Walkers!" and a fade to black would piss me off beyond belief.Really? A Flashback just to show his armor? My point is that Loras would have to wear a closed helmet to pretend being Renly and we never saw it. It would be a lot easier to show Renly when alive using this kick-ass helmet. The same way we know by heart Gendry's helmet. If they decide to include Renly's "ghost" I just hope it's convincing.Really? In my opinion the "three horns" is an almost perfect way to end the season. What an awsome cliffhanger. That's what i want. No need to show any fighting right now. Save this for next season budget.Really? /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' /> Edit: grammar

3184	Silverx2	2012-05-25	the only way i can see Show tyrion killing someone in battle are the following:
1.)ridding someone down via horseback and relativity long weapon
2.)Taking advantage of a previously downed opponent(see on the way to the eyrie)
3.)ranged weaponry
Because of his short appendages hand to hand combat on the ground would comically short, due to angles reach, as well as mobility issues show tyrion has shown(watch cersie push him down)
Once again due to short appendages combat vs another mounted rider would be hard to win due to a horrendous reach disadvantage.
I would expect to see tyrion ride down a couple of people before his horse is taken out from under him, but anything more then capitalizing on an already knocked down opponent would be high unbelievable.
3185	Sun	2012-05-25	EP 19 Spoilers: (got them from a guy on WiC)
	Spoiler There's no Chain. Wildfire is green. Mandon Moore gets killed by Pod. Tyrion sustains injury to his face, but the extent of it is unknown.
3186	madman2711	2012-05-25	No chain ;(
Ps so the others speak the language of scrot(um) they must be very lonely up there in the north

3187	Crown	2012-05-25	No chain ;(That's a big disappointment but not unexpected, there was no build-up to the event this season.
3188	Warden of the North121	2012-05-25	I'm not surpirsed that there's no chain given it hasn't been mentioned yet this season. It would be too much of a deus ex machina at this point.
3189	madman2711	2012-05-25	The appologists cant wait for the purists to complain about this GRRM pened episode but probably wasnt his call about the chain
3190	Fred Stark	2012-05-25	I dont think Tyrion would be having a major scar on his face  like in the books
3191	The Scabbard Of the Morning	2012-05-25	Of course there is no chain, they haven't set that up all season so a chain would be completely deux ex at this point.
I think in the end the chain would have required too much FX and they couldn't do it.

3193	madman2711	2012-05-25	Or maybe the shooting location was not suited for the chain as dubrovnik doesnt have a river nearby or at least something similar
Grrm can be forgiven as only DD can be blamed for this
And why the LOTR dwarfs can be excelent fighters while our only beloved giant lannister is almost impossible to have such qualities
He is Jaime brother he might be smaller in size but he can handle his axe like a true warrior
3194	Ran	2012-05-25	D&D have said they started building the chain, did their best to keep it, but ultimately they had to make a choice as to where to spend the budget for the episode, and they felt they'd find more useful places to put the money. So, fair enough. I'm glad they tried.

3198	Ciglon	2012-05-25	Yeah does anyone have a link to where Dan and Dave said that? I'd be interested to see the interview, unless it was just a twitter or blog post or something.
3199	Sirielle	2012-05-25	It's interesting that they went to such great expense. But who cares? Does it really matter whats in it? Is it going to effect Dany's story in anyway? I don't really get it, if its full of gold that'll get her and her what 7 people a ship? You don't need a vault for that. I'm just worried this whole thing is building to absolutely nothing. What could possibly be in there to benefit her story? Spitball? Vault contains? Barristan? Some Unsullied?? Daario!! Hahaha! Love it! ;D Still it would be nice to have a glimpse inside the vault.Someone mentioned idea of Doreah appearing with Drogon. Indeed maybe she managed to escape Pyat Pree and hides somewhere with Drogon? I doubt escaping him would be possible, but who knows.Xaro should appear in ADwD season, so I don't think he gets killed. On the other hand with chnages doen so far his presence in Meereen will not be necessary, there'll be other ways of solving Dany's plot. If we ever get that far.
3200	Ciglon	2012-05-25	Also, I do think as someone mentioned that the safe will contain money to buy the unsullied because in the show obviously dany has no money whatsoever, whereas in the books she did have some money from gifts and selling them etc. (even thgouth she lost a bit bribing people) Although I suppose it's not a huge problem since they could just say she had money to buy the unsullied from Illyrio's ships anyways. Obviously whatever's in the vault can't really be anything of real importance to the plot later on, which just makes me more curious...
3201	CrypticWeirwood	2012-05-25	Xaro should appear in ADwD season, so I don't think he gets killed. On the other hand with chnages doen so far his presence in Meereen will not be necessary, there'll be other ways of solving Dany's plot. If we ever get that far.I canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t see how Ducksauce could appear in Meereen without major alterations:If he were the king of Qarth, he wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t come himself. If he were not the ruler, there would be no Thirteen to donate thirteen vessels to whisk Dany away. Even if there were a new Thirteen, theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>d never donate thirteen ships to the custody of the man complicit in the murder of  eleven of the previous Thirteen.
3202	CrypticWeirwood	2012-05-25	Also, I do think as someone mentioned that the safe will contain money to buy the unsullied because in the show obviously dany has no money whatsoever, whereas in the books she did have some money from gifts and selling them etc. (even thgouth she lost a bit bribing people) Although I suppose it's not a huge problem since they could just say she had money to buy the unsullied from Illyrio's ships anyways. Obviously whatever's in the vault can't really be anything of real importance to the plot later on, which just makes me more curious...Right: without Magister Illyrioâ<U+0080><U+0099>s three caravels loaded with fine trade-goods, she has no assets to buy slaves with. This makes it even more perplexing how theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll re-introduce Ser Barristan.
3203	Sirielle	2012-05-25	Yup, the series version Xaro makes no sense in Meereen.
Now I remembered one more thing - in the book Danny got a crown with three dragons from the Thirteen (or someone else) in Qarth. I completely forgot about it but that was a symbolic thing. Maybe it waits for her in the vault? Then again - with changes to Qarth plot such present doesn't make sense at all. Pity.
3204	iheartseverus	2012-05-25	Someone mentioned idea of Doreah appearing with Drogon. Indeed maybe she managed to escape Pyat Pree and hides somewhere with Drogon? I doubt escaping him would be possible, but who knows.I'm pretty sure when we saw that closing scene of the hooded figure carrying the cages of baby dragons on his back, there were only two dragon tails dangling out of the cages, and neither one of them looked black.  My theory is Doreah heard the death and slaughter going on outside Dany's quarters, and only had time to snatch one of the dragons and run with it before the thieves broke in.  She has Drogon and they're both in hiding.  That's my spitball and I'm sticking to it!
3205	Sirielle	2012-05-25	Strange Pyat Pree would overlook a girl, but possible *fingers crossed* I would love to see Dany with Drogon on her arm/neck while entering the warlocks' nest /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
3206	iheartseverus	2012-05-25	I don't believe the show ever mentioned that Dany is 'the mother of three dragons, just the mother of dragons.  Doreah could have been out on the balcony feeding Drogon or whatever, saw the slaughter, realized they were coming for the dragons, and fled out the back way with Drogon.  Down the back stairs, thru the alley and out into the teeming labyrinth of the greatest city that ever was or will be.  Long gone before the warlock ever entered the chamber.
3207	Patchface12	2012-05-25	I don't believe the show ever mentioned that Dany is 'the mother of three dragons, just the mother of dragons.  Doreah could have been out on the balcony feeding Drogon or whatever, saw the slaughter, realized they were coming for the dragons, and fled out the back way with Drogon.  Down the back stairs, thru the alley and out into the teeming labyrinth of the greatest city that ever was or will be.  Long gone before the warlock ever entered the chamber.There were 3 tails coming out from under Pyat Pree's shroud above the cage.So King Xaro wouldn't come himself to treat with Dany? If Kings never bother to go and see someone they know, why didn't Robert just send someone to go to Winterfell in his place to ask Ned to be Hand? Halting the slave trade would disrupt Qarth's economy, a serious issue that I could definitely see King Xaro coming to Mereen in person for.
3208	iheartseverus	2012-05-25	There were 3 tails coming out from under Pyat Pree's shroud above the cage.NOT.  I've watched this a dozen times.  There are two dragon tails, not three.  Its more difficult to see in a still like this, because you don't see them whipping back and forth like they're doing in the vid, but here they are.  Two dragon tails.http://img.photobuck...dragontails.jpg
3209	Raja	2012-05-25	I really hope it's not a disappointment given the amount of hype surrounding this episode. I'm sure the writers have changed more than a few things , and made it smaller scale . Hopefully they pull it off . On a side note San-San? Gosh I hope that never works in the last two books. Don't think it'll be a good path for Sansa
3210	iheartseverus	2012-05-25	NOT.  I've watched this a dozen times.  There are two dragon tails, not three.  Its more difficult to see in a still like this, because you don't see them whipping back and forth like they're doing in the vid, but here they are.  Two dragon tails.  Both lighter colored, not black.  Drogon is not here.http://img.photobuck...dragontails.jpglol, meant to edit.  quoted instead.  duh.

3212	moonsblood	2012-05-26	They filmed the battle of the blackwater in a quarry, so I think the chain is possible, also I read this interview with D&D At EWPeter Brown, our sound designer, is our hero because he finally came up with the ice-cracking chatter we had in our heads when we imagined the White Walkers speaking Skroth. For â<U+0080><U+009C>Blackwater,â<U+0080><U+009D> he had to orchestrate a major naval battle and a land battle. And he had to come up with something very big and very loud, which would be a spoiler to explain but book readers will understand.I took this to mean the chain, but I could just really have my hopes up.

3218	Ran	2012-05-26	Re: the chain starting to be built but then dropped when the budget only went so far and they had to make some hard choices,
That's not in any published interview. I have my little birds  Probably wouldn't have heard anything if they hadn't actually started design and building...
Doubtless D&D or GRRM will address this stuff in post-Blackwater interviews, though, but I thought it was good to know (and tell people before hand) so they understand that this particular element is gone not because they wanted it gone, but because they simply couldn't afford it after making the effort to squeeze it into the budget.

But yeah, the Cersei - Sansa scenes are those I await the most from this episode !
3223	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-26	We haven't see much of the Hill Tribes this season, I wonder if they'll show up during the battle. I was thinking they should be in the thick of it since Stannis isn't marching north so there was no reason to have Shagga harrass him on the march

3228	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-26	http://gizmodo.com/5...-on-zero-budget  Sounds to me like they have all the budget they need for the last two episodes. It doesn't cost what it did to make the Terminator anymore. Sure we wont get a bunch of overhead view shots of the massive battle going down but if this guy could do this with zero dollars I'm sure Sunday should be epic.
3229	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-26	The chain will be there. They have bragged and bragged about how brilliant Tyrion is. The chain idea was the most brilliant move he makes in the whole series(novels) so far. So far he is pretty much standing on the fact that he told three different smart guys something different to figure out who the traitor was against him. Has he done anything else to really show his intelligence other than his vocabulary. He needs that chain or else it has all been lip service brilliance. I've seen some people mention the wildfire as his brilliant move but remember that was Cersei.
3230	isiman	2012-05-26	They don't need to show all the chain, just a close shot of a chain out from a couple of CGI towers and a exposition dialogue from Tyrion is enough.
It is a big deal, if Tyrion wont end un up as the hero that saved the city I would be pissed.Even if the battle actually looks good, I care more about the characters than eye candy.
3231	madman2711	2012-05-26	Didn't Sophie Turner mention in an interview that she had to sing for a scene and was nervous about it?What does she sings?Soft kitty, Warm kitty, Little ball of fur. Happy kitty, Sleepy kitty, Purr Purr Purr
3232	protar	2012-05-26	The chain will be there. They have bragged and bragged about how brilliant Tyrion is. The chain idea was the most brilliant move he makes in the whole series(novels) so far. So far he is pretty much standing on the fact that he told three different smart guys something different to figure out who the traitor was against him. Has he done anything else to really show his intelligence other than his vocabulary. He needs that chain or else it has all been lip service brilliance. I've seen some people mention the wildfire as his brilliant move but remember that was Cersei.The chain won't be there. It's confirmed unfortunately.
3233	Warden of the North121	2012-05-26	She's so gorgeous with that color hair, I can't believe the actress sticks with blonde in real life.  Not that she's not lovely as a blonde as well, but with the auburn, she is just breathtaking.I agree Sophie Turner is absolutely stunning, not to mention she's a tremendous young actress. I'm just glad that they haven't made her or Cersei wear those ridiculous southern hairstyles lately. They both look so much prettier without them and quite frankly they were a bit distracting.
3234	moonsblood	2012-05-26	I think the funny hairdos were for summer, so we probably won't see them again.
3235	mpbarnes	2012-05-26	Really? A Flashback just to show his armor? My point is that Loras would have to wear a closed helmet to pretend being Renly and we never saw it. It would be a lot easier to show Renly when alive using this kick-ass helmet. The same way we know by heart Gendry's helmet. If they decide to include Renly's "ghost" I just hope it's convincing.Really? In my opinion the "three horns" is an almost perfect way to end the season. What an awsome cliffhanger. That's what i want. No need to show any fighting right now. Save this for next season budget.Really? /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />Edit: grammar Yeah, Really...my point is it's not a difficult thing to achieve visually and can be done in a compelling way on TV.  Personally for me, ending with the three horns as a cliffhanger, without showing the actual chaos and NW in retreat would be deeply unsatisfying.  They wouldn't "save" the fighting for next season, they'd just pick up on the way to Craster's to save money for all the other scenes.  I'm hoping for some chaos and Sam the slayer in this finale.  Never mentioned fade to black after Sam kills a WW, just that it should be in the final NW scenes.Hahaha! Love it! ;D Still it would be nice to have a glimpse inside the vault.Someone mentioned idea of Doreah appearing with Drogon. Indeed maybe she managed to escape Pyat Pree and hides somewhere with Drogon? I doubt escaping him would be possible, but who knows.Xaro should appear in ADwD season, so I don't think he gets killed. On the other hand with chnages doen so far his presence in Meereen will not be necessary, there'll be other ways of solving Dany's plot. If we ever get that far.Not a real reason for Xaro to be there, could easily be a new king of Qarth or even a new leader in Astapor after Dany gets done with them...Xaro needs to pay for his treachery and I want to see what's in the vault more than I wanted to see Al Capone's vault way back in the day!

3239	victim	2012-05-26	He'll probably defy Davos' orders, look like a complete fool and then die. Should be good.

3242	DurararaFTW	2012-05-26	He'll be the captain of whatever ship Davos' son is on. And indeed by an idiot and die.
3243	LaughedHunter	2012-05-26	I wonder if his son will die at Blackwater or will escape with Stannis.
3244	The Frostfangs	2012-05-26	I wonder if his son will die at Blackwater or will escape with Stannis.I think he will as he is in the previously trailer
3245	DragonAge93	2012-05-26	Matthos will die, as they foreshadowed it with Melisandre whispering in his ear in episode 2: "Death by fire is the most purest of deaths" or something along those lines.
The chain not being in doesn't really bother me. It's only in the battle for, what, 2-5 minutes at most? Sure, it was Tyrion's master plan, but I think his ordering more of the wildfire and telling the guards how to use them is his new "chain", so to speak.
3246	moonsblood	2012-05-26	I think Davos's son will definitely die, especially after what Mel whispered to him.
3247	Papa Manderly's Meat Pie	2012-05-26	Yeah, Really...my point is it's not a difficult thing to achieve visually and can be done in a compelling way on TV.

I don't know how long it has been since you've read the books, but they didn't show that battel in the books either, just flashback descriptions from Sam.Not to mention that the Others didn't attack in the books until Storm, so expecting the Other's to attack and have Sam kill an Other during the retreat seems to be expecting a bit much when they already have a bunch to fit in with the other storylines.No, I think the best ending, in terms of drama, is to end with three blasts from the horn, and a close up of Sam looking terrified.  Or something to that effect.  They definitely won't show any fighting there this season partly for budget reasons (they already went well over for Blackwater, and they still have HotU) but mostly because it doesn't fit within the narrative of the seson and it wasn't in Clash.Furthermore, on a show where they are constantly cutting things simply because it would be too expensive, why would we want them to add an entire battle sequence that never occurred in the books?  If they do that, then that mean they have to cut something somewhere else that is actually in the books.  Storm will have plenty of other budgetary drains without adding the burden of a battle that occured off-page in the books (Astapor, Riverrun, dragons, giants, etc).So, yeah, I'm fine with not showing the Battle at the Fist of the First Men.

3249	Carne	2012-05-26	D&D have hinted at giants appearing in season 2 (Empire Magazine interview).
They would only need some bulky actors (with a lot of make-up and prosthetics) in front of a green screen then insert them into the needed shots (like with the direwolves).
3250	ServantOnIce	2012-05-26	I read the BW chapters again last night and this morning. I know the show will be different, but I am interested in seeing what the production team did.

3252	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-26	The chain not being in doesn't really bother me. It's only in the battle for, what, 2-5 minutes at most? Sure, it was Tyrion's master plan, but I think his ordering more of the wildfire and telling the guards how to use them is his new "chain", so to speak. So Cersei orders thousands of jars and Tyrion takes control and has him make the the last hundred and it makes it his brilliance?  If they don't have the chain they have to have some really cool idea of how to defeat Stannis's Fleet. I don't think Tyrions instruction to the troops of be careful with this stuff would qualify.
3253	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-26	Also everything has changed if Davos is in charge since you can't blame the foolish way they come up the river on some highborn idiot.
3254	mpbarnes	2012-05-26	Why on Earth would you be dissapointed if HBO didn't show the Other's attack on the Fist of the First Men?

"Flashback descriptions" aren't exactly exciting TV.  Showing the actual events as they happen is a lot cooler.  I understand we didn't have the battle in the books, that is EXACTLY why I'd love to see it!  Because this is TV they can do things and show things that GRRM didn't in the books.  Since the whole "three blasts" thing also happened in ASOS, I'm not sure what your issue is here.  I'm basically saying that in addition to the prologue they actually show us a bit of the chaos and Sam killing an Other.  This is not a serious jump forward, just showing a little something more that we didn't get in the books.No, I think the best ending, in terms of drama, is to end with three blasts from the horn, and a close up of Sam looking terrified.  Or something to that effect.  They definitely won't show any fighting there this season partly for budget reasons (they already went well over for Blackwater, and they still have HotU) but mostly because it doesn't fit within the narrative of the seson and it wasn't in Clash.I would rather see the chaos and some action than just hear some horns, someone scream "white walkers"  and fade to black, that's very cheap for TV. It works in the book because it's a prologue and we know we'll get more later (though it does take 250+ pages).  Having us see Sam slay a white walker is completely within the narrative given that Sam just told us about the dragonglass, getting to see what it's used for makes 100% narrative sense.  And as far as this not being in ACOK, the whole "Three blasts" isn't in ACOK either, so I don't understand that argument.  They're already pulling from ASOS if they include the "three blasts."Furthermore, on a show where they are constantly cutting things simply because it would be too expensive, why would we want them to add an entire battle sequence that never occurred in the books?  If they do that, then that mean they have to cut something somewhere else that is actually in the books.  Storm will have plenty of other budgetary drains without adding the burden of a battle that occured off-page in the books (Astapor, Riverrun, dragons, giants, etc).So, yeah, I'm fine with not showing the Battle at the Fist of the First Men.But I'm talking about it happening in this season, so budget is done, it'll either be there in a couple of weeks or it won't. That scene isn't a big budget drain, it's just chaotic, doesn't require the level of extras of Blackwater, or the effects of HOTU, it's basically similar to the way the series opened with the white walkers, with more people running or getting killed, Sam getting isolated and accidentally killing a WW.  Not a lot of extra work and it would be infinitely cooler than just hearing a few blasts and fading to black.
3255	insertname	2012-05-26	If they used Loras in Renly's armour, it would have been smart to put a shot of renly in his armour in the recap. But there's none, which makes me fear this won't appear....
3256	It is known.	2012-05-26	Also everything has changed if Davos is in charge since you can't blame the foolish way they come up the river on some highborn idiot.I think with Davos in charge they'll have him being cautious but the highborn idiot(s) won't listen to him because he's lowborn and they'll charge ahead into the wildfire so it won't be Davos' fault.
3257	Arkash	2012-05-26	The most interesting closing shot, for me, is an helicopter shot of icy/forest landscapes with the three blasts echoing all around...
3258	Targaryen Kaiser	2012-05-26	The most interesting closing shot, for me, is an helicopter shot of icy/forest landscapes with the three blasts echoing all around...I disagree. I'd rather see the shocked faces of the Night Watch men as the last scene of the season. No talk, just their eyes, full of disbelief and terror.
3259	Ciglon	2012-05-26	Well, for that ending scene I think they'll most likely chop the whole scheming plot aspect of that chapter in order to maybe show more Dolorous Edd and Pyp and Grenn to familiarize the audience with them (not to mention they still have to show the dragonglass to the LC etc), and they'll definitely have the three horn blasts and have Sam say again like "three blasts? [look of horror] that's only for white walkers" (DUN DUN) *fade to black*
With regards to tomorrow's episode, do you guys expect we'll see Tyrion killing plenty of good Stannis' men? Or will they not involve him too much in the action so that he's looking around a lot more? We haven't seen any badass gritty Tyrion in the show yet, just a joking, clever, and sometimes serious one who doesn't get the opportunity to get his hands dirty. Should be interesting, also I hope we get to see the Hound (of course SanSan scene, whatever) but esp. his fear of fire, that would be a brilliant scene, showing the Hound being afraid (and later drunk) for the first time (of many upcoming scenes) in the show. Rory McCann is just so excellent as the Hound, the non-book readers are really getting his character and he's nailed the part so far imo.
3260	SerMixalot	2012-05-26	I would assume the vault is opened at some point this season - if you watch the HBO GO interactive features, they went to extensive detail in designing the vault, and the key around his neck actually does in fact open the vault.  Seems like a lot of design & construction expense for something that never comes into play on-air.my guess is that it is empty
3261	SerMixalot	2012-05-26	Really? A Flashback just to show his armor? My point is that Loras would have to wear a closed helmet to pretend being Renly and we never saw it.

3262	iheartseverus	2012-05-26	has the show established what 1, 2 or 3 horns means?Yes, Sam told us.  One for rangers returning, two for wildlings, three for WWs.
3263	SerMixalot	2012-05-26	Of course there is no chain, they haven't set that up all season so a chain would be completely deux ex at this point.I think in the end the chain would have required too much FX and they couldn't do it.the lack of a chain is meaningless as long as Tyrion's STRATEGY leads to the saving of KL
3264	SerMixalot	2012-05-26	Also, I do think as someone mentioned that the safe will contain money to buy the unsullied because in the show obviously dany has no money whatsoever, whereas in the books she did have some money from gifts and selling them etc. (even thgouth she lost a bit bribing people) Although I suppose it's not a huge problem since they could just say she had money to buy the unsullied from Illyrio's ships anyways. Obviously whatever's in the vault can't really be anything of real importance to the plot later on, which just makes me more curious...if there is gold in the vault and she takes it that will be a huge change to her character, if she buys the unsullied with it.  The trickery she used to get the unsullied is critical to the story IMO.
3265	SerMixalot	2012-05-26	I hope she finds all three dragons in the House of Immortals. I`m tired of her whining this season. Don`t want excuses so she can say "i want my poney!" i mean.. "i want my dragon!"no the liine is "I want my oompa loompa, NOW! With fire and blood!"
3266	SerMixalot	2012-05-26	stannis does have davos lead the attack, makes him his hand and davos was responsible for mel not being at the BBW
make one wonder why stannis will keep him around next season
3267	Ciglon	2012-05-26	if there is gold in the vault and she takes it that will be a huge change to her character, if she buys the unsullied with it.  The trickery she used to get the unsullied is critical to the story IMO.For the record, I wasn't suggesting she will buy unsullied with only gold from the vault. In the books she didn't just trade Drogon for the army, she offered to trade all the gold she had (not a lot), along with the ships and everything in them, then the wise masters said "that's a start, we'll trade for all that...and a dragon". So in staying true to the book, she would still be able to use the 'trickery' you spoke of if she had gold, in fact it would be more true to the story, since dany did indeed leave qarth with more gold than when she entered it from gifts (not shown in the program).

They're already pulling from ASOS if they include the "three blasts."If you are following the book narrative, Sam doesn't kill a White Walker at the Fist, the Night Watch gets demolished and they all run off on foot separately for days on end and eventually many are caught by White Walkers and wights from behind.  Sam only kills the Walker that comes on he and Small Paul in the woods on the way back to Craster's keep in desperation after not being able to walk after days and days of running.  That would be a very prolongued method of having your final scene ending just so you can show Sam killing a White Walker and it also kind of deflates the whole mystery of the Walkers at the same time about a minute after re-introducing them.As far as what is good or bad TV, what seems a more dramatic finish to the season?1) an intimate conversation between Sam, Grenn, Dolorous Edd and perhaps Mormont interupted suddenly by 1 horn blast (a quick question by Sam about whether Jon is returning) a 2nd blast (where they all scramble to defend themselves against the Wildlings that the audience also believes are coming due to revealing Mance's camp in a very recent scene) and then utter horror and deer in the headlights look on all of them when the 3rd blast arrives. If you wanted to, you could also pan back and show the Walkers approaching up the base of the Fist as the music climaxes, fade to black...or2) everything above and then a bunch of fights, everyone runs away, they are tracked for days and Sam stabs and kills one of the unstoppable killing machines and we say "See you next year"Guess which scene will have more fans talking throughout the course of the year leading up to next season's premiere?

3270	isiman	2012-05-26	the lack of a chain is meaningless as long as Tyrion's STRATEGY leads to the saving of KLYes, the CHAIN was Tyrion's strategy.In all of his season we saw mostly witty Tyrion and deceitful with Lancel/Pycelle, but nothing showed that he is actually  good in ruling and not only in keeping power.In the books Tyrion does amazing stuff, doesn't make a single mistake and in a few months he is able to get everything ready so he can save a city against overwhelming odds.Where is all of that in the show?I think GRRM concedes too much regarding the characters, which are the best part of his story.I know that he keeps saying that the show is an HBO creature and not his, but some changes in both details or more important elements (sometimes changes are usefull) make some characters go in different directions compared to the books.Tyrion NEEDS to be the hero, and it has to make sense.There must be a way to make it obvious that Tyrion's strategic element saves the day, so why not use the chain?How much can it cost to have a close shot of a chain + an exposition scene?

Thus tyrion saves the day,  I agree that if they dont have Tyrion save the day, than it is another example of HBO just not getting it.

3273	ServantOnIce	2012-05-26	I wanted to do the same, but decided not to. If I did I would be comparing the series to books all the time.After my meltdown last week on this and this website and twitter . . I am relaxed.  I know because of budget, TV adaptations and the other stuff it will not be the same, IT WILL NOT BE THE SAME AT ALL.    Just hope that it is well done, the problem that I have had this season is that  many of the changes made have in my opinion been bad changes. That is all . .
3274	ServantOnIce	2012-05-26	For this battle to be done in a more powerful manner it would need to be a 90 minute episode, practically a movie with the special effects of The Battle of Helm's Deep and the ending battle in "Pirates of the Caribbean:  World's End" to get it near right.  That would be in the high tens of millions of dollars maybe equal to the entire budget for the whole season.

3276	Ciglon	2012-05-26	After hearing that the director for Blackwater is Neil Marshall, who was responsible for the excellent film Centurion a year back, I'm a bit more confident that the battle will really be pretty badass, especially considering that the budget for Centurion was something like $11 million american dollars which is nuts for a motion picture, not too much more than what was spent on blackwater, I'd wager. Also interesting to note, Liam Cunningham (Davos) was also in that film (he was one of the romans and died in that last epic battle IIRC) so I'm sure that having worked together before will really increase the ease and flow between them and Davos' scenes should be nothing short of spectacular tomorrow night /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
Also, anyone have any ideas how Stannis will escape, since it looked like he was on shore in the preview? The non-book readers I've talked to seem to agree that Stannis will likely win (having the upper hand and Joffrey being a villain and all), I wonder if maybe we'll actually see the scene with Axell Florent telling Stannis the day is lost and them running off onto a ship, would make for a great scene, Stannis looking over at the city he almost won, admitting defeat.
3277	The Second Hand	2012-05-26	I can't believe I just realized that they haven't included anything about the chain. Sigh. Another death due to adaptation...

3279	Alias	2012-05-26	I'm going into this one with low expectations, but I have to hope that it will raise the bar for the season dramatically. As someone who doesn't put great stock in epic battle sequences and cool specific effects, I hope they succeed in recreating the  extremely emotional and bleak state of mind that we see the characters of King's Landing facing in light of this battle to end all battles. I haven't been a fan of the build-up thus far, but with Martin himself righting, I have to believe that they'll get it right to an appreciable extent even if I haven't been in love with the teaser sequences.
3280	Valkyrja	2012-05-26	I don't get all you people wanting to know all the specifics for the episode. We already read the books and know what's going to happen, why the hell would you want to know exactly what's going to happen?I rather be either delighted or disappointed while it's happening, instead of reading about it on a fan forum.Personally, I react much better to seeing changes on-screen if I know about them in advance. In fact, I would venture to say that if I know in advance, I will be able to relax and sit back and enjoy the episode moreso than if I am stressed about what changes might be lurking around the corner of each scene the entire time I am watching the episode.
3281	K.C.	2012-05-27	Lots of hints in last episode that the chain may be gone and replaced by another solution.  The pig shit reference was pretty obvious in the sense that the wildfire will play a big part.  Note the placement of the discussion of Tyrion managing the Lannistar toilets for those years, which is true!  I wonder if all three of these are going to come together somehow?  Tyrion will pour all the wildfire down the crappers of the Red Keep and set the whole bay aflame?  Hope they've got good lids on those johhnys!Other than that, the fact that there's no river passing anywhere near the castle in Dubrovnic is a pretty good reason that they may have been forced to make a plot shift.  You also get the sense that when the boats land they are coming in from the ocean directly by the speed and force.  In the books it would have been much different I think and they would have been paddling upstream.Maybe Stannis will land and then watch his whole fleet go up in flames behind him.  Shot at night, which they've done, will look pretty awesome.When Varys (I think) asked, "What do we have?" and Tyrion said, "Pig shit," I figured he meant Joffrey's inspiring presence on the battlefield. /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />
3282	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-27	I think with Davos in charge they'll have him being cautious but the highborn idiot(s) won't listen to him because he's lowborn and they'll charge ahead into the wildfire so it won't be Davos' fault. I agree. That is exactly what I was thinking. Florent will ignore the commands of Davos and ram the barge full of wildfire. Someone else quoted the sound engineer as coming up with something really loud. Fits the bill.

3283	Raja	2012-05-27	The chain not being there does not bother me too much , it's a detail they can let go of for the onscreen adaptation in my opinion
3284	sennahoj	2012-05-27	After re-reading the chapters covering the battle, I can live with losing the chain. I know it's an important part of Tyrion's trap, but the way Tyrion used the widlfire in the books already shows his tactical abilities. So it's okay with me. What's more important to me now is the development of the characters over the battle, Tyrion of course, but also Cersei, Sansa and the Hound. If the show manages to bring that across, I am quite happy to lose the chain.
3285	HouseLark	2012-05-27	OK, so I think that this will be spectacular, a great battle. However, I have a bit of a problem with this in the context of the television series (leaving aside what I know from the books for a second): I don't care who wins. I want Tyrion to make it through but beyond that I guess everyone wants the Lannisters to fall. But what about Stannis? If we want the Lannisters to fall then Stannis obviously needs to win, and here's my problem: I don't give a damn about Stannis right now. I know very little of him or the cast of characters around him so I don't care whether they live or die.
I think this is a real problem because the battle has no drama at all - there are no real stakes for viewers other than seeing Tyrion survive. It will mean nothing to me if Stannis is absolutely routed. Now, if it was the Northmen attacking King's Landing then it would be different.
Now we're at this stage, I believe this is the biggest failing of Series Two. We have a great set-piece battle to cap the series but no stakes. More of the series should have been spent building the characters of Stannis, Davos, etc. To people who have never read the books Stannis is just this new character who corrects grammar, had his brother killed and feels aggrieved. Putting my book-reader hat back on, I can appreciate what the Blackwater means but for show viewers only there may be no real drama or emotion to this battle.

Stannis wasn't necessarily a guy you root for at this point in the book.

His/her source didn't show up for last week's episode.  As of this moment, we don't know if the source showed up with the goodies for tonight's episode.  Hopefully, addsend will pop in here sometime today and let us know, either way.
3292	King Tommen	2012-05-27	They show Sansa and the Hound in the previously on. So I assume they will get some screentime.Which will be nice because presumably after this episode, the two will never interact again (or at least through the seasons covering the books written so far) and I'll never have to hear about this so-called relationship being shortchanged after every episode.  This is one of the aspects of the books I am completely baffled that some fans obsess over, of all things.  I guess it went right over my head but I never put much thought into these two outside of the fact that he clearly had a little soft spot for her and then eventually drunkily stalked her and looked like he might creepily force himself on her before screwing off and running away.  How some people interpreted this as some weird fanfic romance or wanted to see a fleshing out of this seems strange to me.  I always had the impression of the Hound's relationship with Arya in SoS as being far more interesting.  The stuff with Sansa was always uncomfortable and weird.Thankfully, after tonight this weird subset of the fandom will go away.  It's an episode about the biggest battle depicted in the books and you've got people wondering how many awesome scenes are going to be devoted to seeing this inconsequential relationship furthered.
3293	SerSquidford	2012-05-27	Well I personally hope they don't shortchange the Sansa/Hound scene in part because I'm hoping they'll retain all the Hound/Arya adventures next season and the manner of his desertion is fairly integral to setting that up, I think. To be sure, him and the younger Stark are an entertaining duo: I like to picture them strolling away from the inn at the crossroads, with it in the background; they fist-bump, and as they explode it so explodes the inn. Both don sunglasses.(First post, BTW -- hi guys)
3294	DragonAge93	2012-05-27	I agree King Tommen. I never put much thought into the SanSan thing before, not even while reading the book. I mean, they won't see each other again after Blackwater, so why waste time building a relationship on TV only to never follow through with it (as we know from the first five books)? It seems like a waste of screentime, and I can see why they changed it.
3295	Arkash	2012-05-27	Sandor had amazing moments with both the Stark girls, yeah, not the most important part of the story, but you know, those small details enjoyable !
3296	Carne	2012-05-27	As already mentioned at the top of the previous page, Neil Marshall directed Centurion on a low budget, and it has some pretty good battle/fight scenes, like this one:http://www.youtube.c...h?v=_FH0ReBfN-c

3297	addsend	2012-05-27	addsend, our super Secret Agent with your Big Bag O' Spot-on Spoilers, where are you, pal?  The peeps are becoming hysterical.  We need you, pal.  Like, now. My super secret agent with his big bag o' spot-on spoilers refused to leak this week on account of "not ruining the surprise".On the basis that this is a guy who spoils EVERYTHING, I can pretty safely assume that means we're in for a treat.He's been useless recently - I'll try again next week.
3298	Arkash	2012-05-27	Centurion's first half was a disaster: lame, cheesy, ridiculous, with no rythm... but fortunately, the second half, the survival part, the run through the wild, was much more interesting !
3299	victim	2012-05-27	It's funny. While Sandor had some great moments with Sansa that ultimately lead nowhere*, show-Arya had some great moments with show-Tywin that also don't really have a big fiery conclusion. Now, from a writer's point of view, you probably have enough screentime to cut out one relationship and flesh out the other. I know there will be a difference in opinion on this but Arya and Tywin was far better than Sansa and The Hound could ever have hoped to be.
*Of course what I mean by this is in relation to the overall plot. 
Back on topic, I really hope to see Sandor climb onto a boat and start cutting people up before they can get off. There's also a very dramatic scene where Tyrion realises he is afraid of the fire; I'm really worried they'll get this wrong but I'm trusting in George to have written the moment perfectly.
3300	Crown	2012-05-27	I agree King Tommen. I never put much thought into the SanSan thing before, not even while reading the book.

It seems like a waste of screentime, and I can see why they changed it.Actually it's vital to Sansa's character development. Sandor is the opposite of what a knight should be. She learns that the world isn't as beautiful as it is described in the songs.

3302	Ran	2012-05-27	I admit, I do agree with those that wished the producers were more up-front about changes, especially in terms of things that are missing. People understand that there's so much time and budget, that things have to be cut... but it can be quite a shock when some particular element you've been waiting for, perhaps even all season, doesn't show up and there's basically no warning.
I think D&D ought to be less secretive about these things.

That's a level of fanservice that seems completely unrealistic.  Does no one here want to just watch the show or do they need each scene choreographed ahead of time?
3306	ServantOnIce	2012-05-27	Since there are things that are differing in the TV series, could Sansa actually take Sandor up on his offer and escape with him?  There has been NO interaction between Sansa and Ser Dontos since episode #1, no Godswood scenes at all.  Sandor could help Sansa escape and send her off to Littlefinger, especially if the rumors are true about The Joff tonight.  I doubt those rumors greatly but if it happens tonight it wouldn't shock me.
TV show already has departed so much from the books this season that they MAY never meet again.

I think the people who say we absolutely need it to see him as a hero or whatever are being a bit dramatic. Like you said, Tyrion has his other moments of awesomeness in the battle which we should love him more for(as if he needs more love from the TV show fans). And very few people gave him credit for the chain in the books anyway so it's not like his character will be ruined in the show because it's gone.

It's his first step into becoming the much more bitter person we see in ADWD. But yeah so long as Tyrion comes up with some master plan (e.g flushing the wildfire down the sewers.) and gets no credit, then I don't mind the lack of chain.

I wonder if we will actually get a full face shot of Podrick. The times he has been shown, we barely got a good look at him, but he was commented on by both Cersei and Janos, so I hope they have him fighting with Tyrion like in the books.

3329	Crown	2012-05-27	Going to get up early tomorrow morning and pay the iron price for this episode.
3330	kevinbgwrites	2012-05-27	I am almost positive Davos' son is dead. He may even willingly die a zealot-like death further infuriating Davos to murder Mel. I'd at least expect a show of Matthos accepting his death moments before it takes him. Lots of good moments, many not even needing budget(cersei sansa.).
Also I doubt GRRM will leave out any important character moments.
3331	Cressit	2012-05-27	I have long wondered though just how disfigured HBO will allow allow Tyrion's face to be after the battle.  Between the cost of FX and star appeal of Dinklage they may want a sexy scar instead.  Sorry if this has been discussed, I haven't read all 23 pages of the thread so far.
I'm hoping that our seeing Pod with Tyrion last week means that we'll see hero Pod save Tyrion's life.  That's just a little detail my personal little wish list -- I'm pretty sure I'll love the episode however GRRM writes it.
The next five and a  half hours are going to drag by!

3335	Ghost of Crackclaw	2012-05-27	No chain? ::facepalm::Too many things have been 'clean lifts' for this to continue to be enjoyable to me. Not to mention the pointless and completely unnecessary victimization of Dany, the warping of several other characters, etc. D&D have well and truly failed us this season. Yeah, I'll finish out season 2, and then let D&D play out their little storytelling game in peace. Good TV this might be to some. But this has gotten old and stale to me.

3336	Chelly	2012-05-27	Yep.  Ran was here in this thread earlier, and he confirmed it.Thanks.Honestly, I'm not sure how good the chain would look live action. It would kind of silly,imo. I'm just happy we are getting some green wildfire.I also kind of want to see how the Tyrells coming in to defend KL and the Lannisters are going to play out. I'm not a Tyrell fan, but I imagined that being one of their more memorable moments.I'm cleaning the house inside out to pass the time while occasionally checking the forum. Time is definitely passing fast for me, finally.
3337	Lord Rickard Snow	2012-05-27	Well i agree with most people on here.......to paraphrase the expression "Two things are certain, Death and Taxes"
but in the GRRM universe Two Things are Certain, Death and Death
3338	House Snow	2012-05-27	Look people can complain about other stuff, but the chain is purely a money thing.  If you can't handle that then you really really really should stop watching the show.  Either that or make a significant fincancial contribution.
3339	Ser Hippie	2012-05-27	People flipping out about the chain are funny. It helps the Lannisters win the battle but it's hardly an iconic or particularly important part of the story. Given, say, losing the chain or the wildfire, I'd lose the chain every day. Losing it (particularly because of financial reasons) is not a big deal. At all.
3340	Tewks44	2012-05-27	obviously they can't have a chain because that would be too confusing for television audiences
(isn't that the go to excuse for seemingly unnecessary changes?)
3341	protar	2012-05-27	No chain? ::facepalm::Too many things have been 'clean lifts' for this to continue to be enjoyable to me. Not to mention the pointless and completely unnecessary victimization of Dany, the warping of several other characters, etc. D&D have well and truly failed us this season. Yeah, I'll finish out season 2, and then let D&D play out their little storytelling game in peace. Good TV this might be to some. But this has gotten old and stale to me. And I have better things to do than waste my time being annoyed at a TV show.I recognize that valuing textual fidelity can lead to unhappiness. But season one, while a departure, was a faithful departure. True and false statements can still be made about fictional universes, and I'm done sifting through all the absolutely, strictly unnecessary (in fact, downright nonsensical and derailing) changes.Alas.You do realise they tried to put the chain in but couldn't due to budgetary issues right? There have been stupid, nonsensical changes in this season but the lack of the chain is not one of them. And when I'm defending a book deviation, you know it's reasonable. /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
3342	Crown	2012-05-27	I think the wildfire through the sewer system (if they use it) will be a smart alternative to the chain. It will still make Tyrion look like a genius.
3343	King Tommen	2012-05-27	No chain? ::facepalm::Too many things have been 'clean lifts' for this to continue to be enjoyable to me.

True and false statements can still be made about fictional universes, and I'm done sifting through all the absolutely, strictly unnecessary (in fact, downright nonsensical and derailing) changes.Alas.The reason Season 1 was more word for word was because the scope of the novel still lent itself to a relatively faithful adaptation.  The piling on of characters and locations in ACOK guaranteed that more drastic changes were going to have to be made.  Anyone who didn't understand this was living in a dream world.And honestly, if the absence of a freaking chain is what sets you off, then I don't know what to say.  Ran has already posted that D&D attempted to include it in the season but the cost involved was prohibitive so they had to shelf it in order to maintain other far more important elements (like say the Wildfire effects).  If you read any interview by these guys, what's clear is that they have a clear love of the source material and are doing their absolute best to adapt the story as faithfully as possible.  They don't think they can do the story better, they are making changes in order to adapt a sprawling fantasy tomb into the television medium on a budget and on a schedule.  There are going to be cuts as well as additions in order to get the story to the proper place at the end.I have no idea why these relatively small changes in the grand scheme of the ASOIAF universe are causing such consternation.  I can't fathom how a fan could just completely lose faith in a show that is beloved by both critics and fans just because they don't like the 5% of the show that isn't in the novels.  If these fans stepped back and looked at the big picture, I think they could mostly agree that the changes are for the large part, essentially inconsequential when it comes to telling the overall story.  Sometimes there are different routes being taken to get to the destination but the main story itself is not being altered.If the absence of the chain is the breaking point, then you need to go have some time for yourself in order to rethink just how to approach watching this show.  For 99.9% of the audience this should not affect your enjoyment of the show.
3344	JP Dayne	2012-05-27	My guess:Talisa will tell Robb she is Jeyne.  They story she gave is that of her Grandmother's.  Robb will meet her family.  Talisa/Jeyne is in on something with Roose, right now.  There are knowing looks whenever they pass each other in the tent.  I think they weren't planning on Jeyne actually falling in love with Robb.  She was supposed to just be a spy, passing on info from Roose to Tywin.  Roose is so adamant about Ramsay going to Winterfell, because that is part of the plan, for the Bolton's to hold Winterfell for Tywin.  There was no Weasel Soup because in the TV version, Roose gets to take Harrenhall without a fight, since he is already partnered with Tywin.  Mandon Moore will try to kill Tyrion, Pod will save him.No chain, but wildfire from the sewers, trapping the ships.  Not sure if there will be a "Renley" sighting.Arya will see Jaqen, he will change his face.By Ep. 10, Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie will have run into someone from the Brotherhood.IMO, those looks mean that roose bolton doesnt like Talisa, and she's kinda akwardly aware of that...he doesnt like Robb having a fling with herShow-Roose hasnt showed yet any sign of treasonI think, eventually he will revolt against robb for marrying jeyne (i think she will pop up next season), endangering the deal with the freys and putting the whole incursion in jeopardyLastly, i think she really is talisa. the whole touching story about her brother was too "deep" so she will say "lol j/k that was my granny's story".So my wild guess is that roose will kill talisa somehow, and robb will meet another girl, real jeyne westerling, next seasonand if we see Renly's ghost... i'm gonna have nerdgasmstoo bad renly's armor in the show wasnt green, it could be very flashy /biggrin.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':D' />
3345	salt	2012-05-27	Talisa took the place of Jeyne.
3346	Robb_	2012-05-27	Any idea where Doreah is supposed to be?
3347	Crown	2012-05-27	Any idea where Doreah is supposed to be?In hiding with Drogon. I have no idea where.
3348	moonsblood	2012-05-27	In Drogon's belly
3349	Ghost of Crackclaw	2012-05-27	Suffice it to say it's the last strlink. /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> It's symbolic of so much else that was cut or changed for "budgetary reasons" (i.e., sheer lack of foresight and creativity). You don't need a giant honking CG chain to do it. You just need to actually invest your mind in the work. There are numerous ways of conveying things that don't involve budget.Take, for instance, the Two Towers. Fans took the footage from the film and made a better movie than PJ did with his frivolous and unfaithful approach to the story. It's the same effect in season 2. This could have been done better, "bigger scope" or no. There is simply no excuse for it, except D&D didn't invest their minds in the story. It is a failure of vision.I thoroughly disagree with you that all roads that meet at the same destination are the same road. Many of the characters portrayed are fundamentally different characters now, with fundamentally different motivations and resources.

3350	Drogon's Personal Trainer	2012-05-27	I thoroughly disagree with you that all roads that meet at the same destination are the same road. Many of the characters portrayed are fundamentally different characters now, with fundamentally different motivations and resources.It's a valid point, but I'm going to say this - yet again, at the risk of becoming a broken record, folks - D&D know from George how the thing ends, and maybe - just maybe - the cuts/changes/character arcs, whatever, will fit that final ending. They have major plot points to develop that will move towards the final clash and denouement; perhaps some things that you and I love along the way aren't so crucial to the final showdown.  Just a thought.
3351	flinky	2012-05-27	as long as Tyrion goes out and is attacked by Mandon with Pod pushing him into the water that part of the battle would be worth it.
same goes for Davos watching the initial wildfire and the boat with its hull bleeding it. 
they can do without Garlan in Renly's armour, can only hope for the season to end with 3 blows of the horn on the Fist.

They may all well work out to the same end. But they've also dropped a flaming turd on a rich, visceral potentiality--no one else will take this material on, so it will stand as the visual example. It's simply lamentable.
3353	moonsblood	2012-05-27	I wonder if Dontos will make an appearance tonight.

Every place I look, this show is being lauded for its scope and storytelling.  It has been able to garner an audience that vastly exceeds the fantasy novels and has received critical acclaim as well as almost universal praise from the fandom.The only people who seem to be having an issue are an extremely small segment of the book fanbase who simply cannot abide anything that isn't taken directly from the page.  Honestly, speak for yourself and don't try and make the argument that you are tapping into some kind of populist opinion.  The show's not perfect but neither were the novels and your expectation level of what an HBO television adaptation of this series would look like was so obviously far out of whack with reality, I don't think anything would have satisfied you.

3365	madman2711	2012-05-27	IMO cutting for budgetary restrains i don't mind but it is the only grand battle of the war of 5 kings the rest are just hinted or playbacked to us in the books, i only dislike adding scrnes that are stupid or unnecessary
This one we lived it thru sansa tyrion and davos eyes and was epic in my mind 
Thank the old gods we will see vargo hoat the goat next season
I am a lannister but vargo is a badguy that i loved hating him

Weren't they fucking around in the Kingswood, in the books?Anyway, I'm off to bed. Waking up tomorrow with a changed Westeros.
3367	Raja	2012-05-27	I wouldn't mind them cutting Dontos out , given how they've not set him up at all ( unless they do at the end of this season or the beginning of the next )  . The non book folk will be bothered if he just shows up out of nowhere I think. It could very well be a random extra who brings her to LF

By all means. That's what keeps the world spinning 'round. I've already outlined elements that were satisfying--I am simply unapologetic about being unsatisfied with a flawed effort. Yes, it gets a passing grade. Good job, D&D, well done on your 'C' plots that could have had all the merits that the cast and set design and writers brought to the table, and possess textual fidelity also, but for want of a little vision. You call it unrealistic, but having actually done my share of translating and then adapting drama, I can tell you it is more than possible.As I said: lamentable.

Virtual lemon cakes to the winner!  /tongue.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':P' />
3373	Raja	2012-05-27	But why bother even introducing him then?Good point , though I would think they would put him in filler scenes at least once , to remind the audience he's still there. Maybe it was just a way to show how cruel Joff was but you could be right. I hope they do bring him in . However if they don't , I won't be too distraught
3374	moonsblood	2012-05-27	I'm thinking right cheek, personally I'd like to see an eye patch, but thats so not going to happen.
3375	House Snow	2012-05-27	I'm wondering if they are going to play Raines during a battle sequence.  Didn't one of the previews with Sandor swinging the sword play in slow motion-makes me think there is a song going on there.
3376	iheartseverus	2012-05-27	I'm thinking right cheek, personally I'd like to see an eye patch, but thats so not going to happen. 1.  spiritguides:  right cheek, potential eye patch2.  iheartseverus:  through left eyebrow, eyelid and below eye
3377	DragonAge93	2012-05-27	Yeah I don't think they'd introduce Dontos and not have him play a part in the story later on. He'll most likely try to help her in season 3, since people forget D&D said that they are moving some things back and some things forward, it's now an adaption of the whole saga, not just book-per-season as many tend to believe still. It may have been the case for season 1, but it was much smaller in scope and more focused on a central character than season 2 and beyond.
3378	Arrogant Bastard	2012-05-27	Interested to see if they keep Pod pushing Mandon into the water. I imagine they will, but I wonder if the audience will even know who the hell Pod is? I don't even remember them saying his name this season, though I'm sure they did, and he's done little else but pour drinks--has he even had a line yet?
I guess they're saving Dontos for next season. I have a bad feeling that they will reveal way too early that it was Littlefinger behind Dontos all along.
3379	House Snow	2012-05-27	They have said his name twice but he hasn't talked yet.  I suspect we will get a scene with both Pod and Moore in the beginning of the episode to remind who they are.
3380	King Tommen	2012-05-27	Interested to see if they keep Pod pushing Mandon into the water. I imagine they will, but I wonder if the audience will even know who the hell Pod is? I don't even remember them saying his name this season, though I'm sure they did, and he's done little else but pour drinks--has he even had a line yet?I guess they're saving Dontos for next season. I have a bad feeling that they will reveal way too early that it was Littlefinger behind Dontos all along.If Pod is the one saving Tyrion (which according to spoilers for those that have seen the episode, he is) then I'm sure that they'll make a bigger point of integrating him into Tyrion's battle preparations in this episode.  The character has a bigger part to play as the series continues and they wouldn't have cast him this year if they weren't going to let him play a part in the proceedings.Did he even have any lines in the books at this point?
					
					
							Edited by King Tommen, 27 May 2012 - 05:47 PM.
3381	House Snow	2012-05-27	Also with LF being behind Dontos you can't really initiate the scene b/t him and sansa until LF gets back from his trip.  He was apparently suppose to have some scenes alread according to the actor  so they might not have been thrilled with what they got.
3382	Arkash	2012-05-27	I wonder how the episode will kick ?
Maybe sunset, Stannis' fleet appearing on the horizon...
I wonder how many pre-battle time we will have.
3383	flinky	2012-05-27	Dontos is in the throne when Tyrion helps Sansa up after Joffrey holds the crossbow to her. He is also in other shots in the background. Kind of like Waldo.
3384	King Tommen	2012-05-27	Dontos has a lot of time in order to be introduced and have the plot line rolling (probably a season+ based on when Joffrey's wedding will end up occurring).  Starting the plotline too early runs the risk of having it tread water for too long.  That kind of stuff doesn't fly with a television audience (the audience already got impatient with Jon and Dany's stories this year because they felt like there wasn't enough forward momentum in their stories.

3402	iheartseverus	2012-05-27	I want those lemon cakesGotta earn 'em, pal!  Tough competition here!
3403	Ser Hippie	2012-05-27	D&D are going to have Tyrion's head chopped completely off to be joined as part of Ser Robert Strong as part of their continued campaign to troll posters on this site.
3404	Cressit	2012-05-27	diagonally slashing down across nose left to right (same as cressit, just different angle)right handed person would slice down hitting the left side first and ending on right jaw area I considered that but then I called up images of HBO-Tyrion in my mind and they kept being 3/4 angles showing his right side so I figured they play up that cheekbone and eye area /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />
3405	SerMixalot	2012-05-27	yes, but will we see the chain? /devil.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':devil:' />
3406	Ciglon	2012-05-27	I'd say a fairly large scar running from over his right eyebrow down around his eye continuing down through his cheek, past his mouth to his jaw line...I don't think they'll skimp out on the makeup for it, just a hunch.
Also I've been kinda hoping for a good Dontos-as-a-fool scene, wonder if they'll even keep that in? Wouldn't be too difficult to introduce later when the audience starts recognizing him as Dontos in ep 1.
3407	Bran Snow	2012-05-27	I considered that but then I called up images of HBO-Tyrion in my mind and they kept being 3/4 angles showing his right side so I figured they play up that cheekbone and eye area /cool4.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':cool4:' />good reasoning but i guess we'll just have to see who's right /wink.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=';)' />Gotta earn 'em, pal!  Tough competition here!I could just make some in the mean time - http://www.innatthec...27/lemon-cakes/

3410	SerMixalot	2012-05-27	Tyrion will chip a nail.
It is known
3411	Maester Murks	2012-05-27	Tyrion's scar will be on the forehead or, less likely, on the neck!
3412	Bran Snow	2012-05-27	Tyrion will chip a nail.It is knownI see your 'It is known' and raise you a 'You know nothing, john snow'
3413	moonsblood	2012-05-27	one more hour guys!
3414	Zod	2012-05-27	Minor slice on the left cheek.
3415	SerMixalot	2012-05-27	I see your 'It is known' and raise you a 'You know nothing, john snow'nonsense, it is knownand i am sure some dothraki will echo my sentiment
3416	iheartseverus	2012-05-27	Tyrion's scar will be on the forehead or, less likely, on the neck!nah... take a stand!  make a choice!  I mean, virtual lemon cakes are at stake here!
3417	SerMixalot	2012-05-27	I want to change my answer
at some point Tyrion will be out of breath
3418	Istari	2012-05-27	my only problem with HBO bringing Dontos in for the final two episodes is that it will be too hasty. 
Obviously tonight will be a big episode with lots to include, and Valar Morghulis will be another episode that will have a lot of plot to cover
To me, Dontos is a storyline that can wait until next season. 
HBO's best bet would be to just wait until season three: it will be suspenseful for the t.v viewers to have Dontos act as her valiant knight in timing with her betrothal/marriage to Tyrion
3419	SerMixalot	2012-05-27	THE PREVIEW LOOKS AWESOME!!!!!!
3420	Bran Snow	2012-05-27	nonsense, it is knownand i am sure some dothraki will echo my sentimenthmm..... dothraki vs wildlingsbut back on to topic with the forum, I can seem them bring Dantos back for a brief scene. After the hound leaves and after Joffery kicks Sansa ahead for his new bride. It will prob be more of "Since you saved my life, I will save yours. I will get you out of here in time." and that will be it for the season.

Zod:  Minor slice on the left cheekI'm going to say that the scar begins at the top left side of his face and slices down diagonally across his forehead, between his eyebrows (or the verrry start of his left eyebrow), across the bridge of his nose and ends on his right cheek. So basically the majority of the scar will be on his forehead.

3426	Arbor Gold I'm Sold	2012-05-27	Yeah I don't think they'd introduce Dontos and not have him play a part in the story later on. He'll most likely try to help her in season 3, since people forget D&D said that they are moving some things back and some things forward, it's now an adaption of the whole saga, not just book-per-season as many tend to believe still. It may have been the case for season 1, but it was much smaller in scope and more focused on a central character than season 2 and beyond.I think it has been this way the whole time. If you recall Catelyn's interrogation of Jaime in the first season that didn't happen until the end of book 2.
3427	Trebla	2012-05-27	Before the episode even airs, allow me to lament that whoever wrote it has no idea what they are doing and has RUINED the show!!!

3430	Valkyrja	2012-05-27	I have no idea how they will injure Tyrion, but I'll be fine with whatever scar they give him as long as it is a makeup job that can be easily sustained during the rest of the series. It  might not even be a facial scar for all we know.....
Only a little while longer until we find out! /smile.png' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' />

3448	Arkash	2012-05-28	I just noticed that during the episode, Tyrion wears the Hand's chain around his neck instead of the unique hand we've seen since the beginning.
I wonder if George himself asked for this change, in prevision of what is to come with them... anyway, it was nice to spot them.
