"Tom son of Tom",2013-04-14,"910 i loved every bit particularly the riverun scenes"
"Greywolf2375",2013-04-14,"still great tv some of the portions cut out are for time and make complete sense some just dont follow with the charactershow brienne is talking to jaime stannis and melisandre and i still believe that with the cast of characters that were available and the depth they had any time i see roz on screen it is a waste have more to say but will have to later"
"Lord Godric",2013-04-14,"i gave episode 1 a 7 episode 2 an 8 and this one a 9 they are getting better and better a very strong episode"
"Wyman_Manderly",2013-04-14,"they dumbed down theons arc quite a bit it seems   i actually liked this episode much more than the last two however i wish they used the valuable 5 minutes of air time they wasted after the podrick fiasco in something more important"
"Tewks44",2013-04-14,"i generally only reserve 10s for truly exceptional episodes so i gave it a 9 but id give it a 95 if i could"
"Trebla",2013-04-14,"9 best episode since blackwater"
"Warhawk137",2013-04-14,"9 you can really tell that this is the episode where the seasons momentum got started i liked the first two episodes but really they were mostly comprised of setting up new characters reminding us where everybody stands and just some general dicking around now were getting somewhere edited by warhawk137 14 april 2013  0900 pm"
"Tewks44",2013-04-14,"they dumbed down theons arc quite a bit it seems  i actually liked this episode much more than the last two however i wish they used the valuable 5 minutes of air time they wasted after the podrick fiasco in something more importantkinda hard to say they dumbed down an arc that isnt in the books i think theons arc is quite plausible"
"Stallion That Mounts Texas",2013-04-14,"ill give it a solid 8 1 love watching the theon story unfold before our eyes poor theon 2 i think they made edmure too much of an idiot im loving the blackfish 3 martyn and willem the grandsons of tywins fathers brother i guess kevans story is done 4 loving dany more and more cant wait to see her take the city 5 poor jaime that was well done 6 the scene with the small council was strange 7 pod is the man he must give details best sequence of the episode"
"Ser Farbod",2013-04-14,"910 easily the best episode so far this season the rhaegar quote made me smile and the end was fantastic i loved the blackfish as well fantastic job"
"Died a Hero",2013-04-14,"holy hell this episode was perfect 10 from the somber tones of riverun to the lighthearted banter of pod and tyrion seeing the bastards hunt no not bastard never bastard danys talk and walk and a bear a bear but my god that ending my god if you rated this episode anything lower than a 7 delete your account turn off your computer and never watch the show again because nothing they do will ever please you good god that ending edited by died a hero 14 april 2013  0901 pm"
"Greyjoy67",2013-04-14,"best of the three so far  nicely paced didnt rush things and got the tone of certain scenes spot on eg cat  blackfish made me well up a bit nailed that scene from the book last scene with jaime was great theons chase brought a nice bit of excitement only thing i didnt like somewhat predictably was the whore scene with podrick the last bit is clearly relevant though but i cant remember why what storyline is that going into anyway 810 hmm fuck it ill say 9 i liked it a lot"
"TheWhiteRabbit",2013-04-14,"best episode of the season so far i gave it a 9"
"Fez",2013-04-14,"maybe its because i was drinking a bit read a lot that made me like this one so much more than the first two episodes but i dont think so this was wellpaced wellwritten not too jumpy but still covered most or possibly all of the ongoing plots and really funny i was almost dying at the start of the small council meeting 1010 also the song at the end that was amazing just the juxatipostion between jamies scream and how upbeat and happysounding it was i was literally literally rolling on the floor laughing"
"winterstood",2013-04-14,"id honestly saya 10 outta 10 for real loved how they condensed the riverrun scenes  very effective shows how robbs a brilliant strategisttactician and was betrayed  in the book he was betrayed by roose bolton  who was the guy that did the blunder move on the show  didnt catch the name  but robb dealt with him well and i loved the funeral scene  touching funny  the blackfish was well cast  and the beautiful blanket that covered hoster tully the colors the texture  wow"
"TheHedgeWizard",2013-04-14,"gave it a 9 pretty slow during the episode but was so happy to finally see the tullys and riverrun a bunch of moments had me laughing the pod brothel scene was great and of course hand chopped that scene was perfect different from the book but still a holy shit moment great episode"
"Frumpus",2013-04-14,"they dumbed down theons arc quite a bit it seems  i actually liked this episode much more than the last two however i wish they used the valuable 5 minutes of air time they wasted after the podrick fiasco in something more importantthey dumbed theons arc down last season this season his arc is entirely new as he wasnt even around in the books so im not sure how you can say it was dumbed down unless you are including the previous seasonim not a fan of the theon scenes this season but thats largely because they are predictable and as book readers we all know whats going to happen in the end anyway so its wasting valuable screentime that could be used for actual scenes from the book"
"Zman1863",2013-04-14,"thought it was a good episode the dany scene was really good so were the brienne and jaime scenes i chuckled at the rock version of the bear and the maiden fair after jaimes hand got chopped off it was well placed"
"thegreatwhitebear",2013-04-14,"i love that scene with pod bron and tyrion one of the funniest moments since tyrion hoped cersei ate the turtle soup he jacked off in lol that and the end was great blackfish is awesome"
"Zios",2013-04-14,"i must be missing something or just in a meh mood 710 felt like i was watching filler other than the danyending"
"Fez",2013-04-14,"also the meereenese knot joke dd showing their trollface i see rofl2gif classbbcemoticon altrofl "
"Warhawk137",2013-04-14,"they dumbed theons arc down last season this season his arc is entirely new as he wasnt even around in the books so im not sure how you can say it was dumbed down unless you are including the previous seasonim not a fan of the theon scenes this season but thats largely because they are predictable and as book readers we all know whats going to happen in the end anyway so its wasting valuable screentime that could be used for actual scenes from the bookforgot tags spoiler erm fwiw why have all this crap with riverrun if we know whats going to happen to robb anyway yeah sure its in the books but we already know how it ends so why not skip it all obviously my point is this is supposed to be a coherent complete television show aimed at a wide audience not the drama clubs fanfiction reenactment of their own personal favorite scenes edited by warhawk137 14 april 2013  0921 pm"
"mafalda",2013-04-14,"i gave it an eight minus points for stannis begging to get some from mel and pods journey to losing his virginity i love this show but what have they turned stannis into but great episode"
"Zman1863",2013-04-14,"i love that scene with pod bron and tyrion one of the funniest moments since tyrion hoped cersei ate the turtle soup he jacked off in lol that and the end was great blackfish is awesomeyeah i thought the pod stuff was pretty funny even if the producer for boob exposure or whatever its called was behind its inclusion at least those scenes included giving the background for tyrions new position as master of coin and how lf was leaving a big mess behind"
"Table8",2013-04-14,"not digging the ep as much as the above posters really disappointed with some of the changes especially the pervy way they wrote stannis and a couple of filler scenes that seriously made no sense wtf was up with that talisa scene glad they mentioned the iron bank need to watch it again to really give it a score but wasnt that impressed from first glance"
"Tewks44",2013-04-14,"erm fwiw why have all this crap with riverrun if we know whats going to happen to robb anyway yeah sure its in the books but we already know how it ends so why not skip it allobviously my point is this is supposed to be a coherent complete television show aimed at a wide audience not the drama clubs fanfiction reenactment of their own personal favorite scenesyeah and i mean book readers know how the seasons going to end anyway so why bother making the show"
"Funkagenda",2013-04-14,"pretty good episode love the ending also the pod scene was pretty funny blackfish seemed cool to me edmure was also okay they seem to let ramsay be the goodguy just a little bit longer cant wait for the turn in that also locke seemed like an interesting chaarcter as well dont really miss vargo tbh"
"Darth Pipes",2013-04-14,"910 great episode the best since blackwater it felt like the storylines got a little more time too off the bat i want to say that i didnt like the way blackfish treated edmure he was compassionate to him when he missed the boat in the book telling him he had missed too whatever his feelings he wouldnt shove the lord of riverrun out of the way either that being said i loved his scene with catelyn very emotional and wellacted i think the blackfish character will be just fine speaking of emotional im surprised with just how much they got out of hot pies goodbye touching scenewell miss you hot pie fn loved the silent game of musical chairs played by the small council brilliant scene in every way the body language between the three stooges of westeros was perfectthey realize that the stern headmaster has returned meerenese knotnice way to work that reference in that was some fantastic horseplay in the theon chase scene i figured hbo would be reluctant to allow that with all the problems they had with luck still a fantastic sequence and they are doing a great job introducing the little bastard into the show book dialogue between jorah and barristan especially the rhaegar fought honorably but rhaegar died line very happy that was worked in jaime and brienne continue to be mvps this season gc did a good job showing briennes reaction to the terrible situation shes in ncw does some great work too and we get the big scene i have to admit the rock version of the bear and the maiden fair was jarring but darkly hilarious"
"Cas Stark",2013-04-14,"better than the last two i still feel the pacing was off and rushedso um pod at a whore house was a lot of wasted time and the rock music at the end was really really jarring if i didnt know storm of swords was the season they were waiting for i would never know it from watching season 3 since it feels much more thrown together than the first two"
"nara",2013-04-14,"not digging the ep as much as the above posters really disappointed with some of the changes especially the pervy way they wrote stannis and a couple of filler scenes that seriously made no sense wtf was up with that talisa scene i think the talisa scene was to showposting the rest in book spoiler code spoiler how young and innocent the lannister boys are before they get whacked by karstark"
"Serial Killer Arya",2013-04-14,"im just glad they mentioned rhaegars namemore than once i think i squealed i 3 blackfish never liked edmure so i liked his portrayal dany i like her feisty overall 8 i wished they had showed jamies skill from the prior seasons so people could really understand how great he wasto understand how crushed he will be best episode so far"
"go joff go",2013-04-14,"95 only bc the preview made it pretty clear that next weeks episode is going to be crazy also ithought both beinoff and weiss were going to direct the episode but only one got credit"

"Lord Godric",2013-04-14,"thought it was a good episode the dany scene was really good so were the brienne and jaime scenes i chuckled at the rock version of the bear and the maiden fair after jaimes hand got chopped off it was well placedi disagree it was jarring and took away from the drama"

"Cas Stark",2013-04-14,"i disagree it was jarring and took away from the dramatotally jarring this is game of thrones not the sopranos the music is not supposed to be modern or hip it was really stupid of them i thought"
"scurvy",2013-04-14,"i was despondent last week with all of the made up scenes that overwrote good scenes this episode was great loved the bastard building trust with theon and drawing it out thats going to be terrific thapphireth"
"BananaSpice",2013-04-14,"i really liked it but i may have actually liked last week better  i dunno it just felt like they wasted a lot of time on cersei and tyrion dragging chairs and the pod is a studmuffin thing sigh so many parts were super awesome though like danys parts were pure gold  definitely my favorite part this time around i also thought that arya and gendry saying buy to hot pie was super cute"
"Table8",2013-04-14,"totally jarring this is game of thrones not the sopranos the music is not supposed to be modern or hip it was really stupid of them i thoughtespecially after the dramatic final scene the music totally didnt fit if it came at the end of episode 2 i wouldnt have minded it so much but jaime losing his hand is a big event and deserves a more tense or melancholy ending theme but got is beyond mainstream and i guess we have to accept it will be prone to the marketing geniuses at hbo who try too way hard to be cool"
"Warhawk137",2013-04-14,"i really liked it but i may have actually liked last week better  i dunno it just felt like they wasted a lot of time on cersei and tyrion dragging chairs and the pod is a studmuffin thing sighwell not everything can be rollicking adventure i thought those were respectively a very smart character moment and a nice bit of levity"
"Ser Farbod",2013-04-14,"totally jarring this is game of thrones not the sopranos the music is not supposed to be modern or hip it was really stupid of them i thoughti thought the music was excellent way to slap you out of the shock that jamie lannister just had his sword hand cut off i thought it was nicely done"
"Cas Stark",2013-04-14,"especially after the dramatic final scene the music totally didnt fit if it came at the end of episode 2 i wouldnt have minded it so much but jaime losing his hand is a big event and deserves a more tense or melancholy ending themebut got is beyond mainstream and i guess we have to accept it will be prone to the marketing geniuses at hbo who try too way hard to be coolit really irritated me for some reason the music is usually so great the violins make you want to cry i cant imagine what they were thinking with that kind of a modern treatment for the song"
"Southpaw89",2013-04-14,"910easily the best episode so far this season the rhaegar quote made me smile and the end was fantastic i loved the blackfish as well fantastic jobi was so happy to hear that quote it literally made the episode a whole lot better"
"Warhawk137",2013-04-14,"especially after the dramatic final scene the music totally didnt fit if it came at the end of episode 2 i wouldnt have minded it so much but jaime losing his hand is a big event and deserves a more tense or melancholy ending themebut got is beyond mainstream and i guess we have to accept it will be prone to the marketing geniuses at hbo who try too way hard to be cooli think the more likely explanation for hbo using a punk version of that song for the credits would be a deliberate case of soundtrack dissonance rather than the idea that hbo is so out of touch theyre actually making dd put punk music in their show because its what the kids like these days"
"ServantOnIce",2013-04-14,"gave it a 4 disappointed weakest of the season so far imo and the worst episode in a while   one of the worst ones ever jmo"
"BananaSpice",2013-04-14,"well not everything can be rollicking adventure i thought those were respectively a very smart character moment and a nice bit of levityi didnt dislike the scenes but they seemed to drag on just a bit too long for me while other more important scenes felt a tad rushed i dunno i definitely still liked it a lot"
"Sxxman",2013-04-14,"i would give it a 9 mostly loved everything about it the thing with the pod scene is that if it happened to any other character but him i probably wouldve been annoyed but i thought it was hilarious and harmless the only issue i had with the episode was the punkstyle rendition of batmf it was really offputting best episode of the season io"
"mafalda",2013-04-14,"gave it a 4 disappointed weakest of the season so far imo and the worst episode in a while   one of the worst ones ever jmowhy do you feel that way ive had some episodes that felt meh to me but i dont think ive ever given an episode lower than a 6 what didnt work for you this episode just curious i love reading other peoples opinions smilepng classbbcemoticon alt "
"Ferrum Aeternum",2013-04-14,"1010 superb television with plenty of laughs to go along with some genuine tense moments maybe dd need to direct more episodes random thoughtsthe meereenese knot reference by tyrion was an awesome nod to book readers actually even though that scene was this weeks typical silly got naked chicks extravaganza even it was well done thanks to tyrions sales pitch to podif i were writing the episode stan  mels conversation would have gone differently although mels deadpan reaction to stans goofy i want you line was comedy gold gold jerry at least now the viewing audience knows that shadowbabies arent an unlimiteduse deus ex machinai have to say im enjoying not knowing what the hell is going on with theons arc apart from the identity of boy quite interested to see where this is going the chase scene was fantastic and im sure cost a fortune in stunt men and horsesthe blackfish is as ideal a casting as could possibly be done  bravo clive russell and of course nina goldastapor scenes were again hilarious and riveting danys arc is my favorite thus far this seasonlold hard at the small council meeting some great comic timing lolgif classbbcemoticon altlol even with my skin crawling at knowing what was coming next i fistpumped at jaime saving brienne with the sapphire story and while i like locke well enough as a hoat replacement i did miss thapphirethi think this episode may have set the record for intelligent nonsex related backstory exposition loved barry  jorah talking rhaegar especially the inclusion of jorahs fan favorite lineso yeah this was great and judging by next weeks preview it looks like were due for no less than three explosive epic scenes in that episode should be killer"
"Victarious",2013-04-14,"the credits song had me rolling need to rewatch this"
"Zman1863",2013-04-14,"especially after the dramatic final scene the music totally didnt fit if it came at the end of episode 2 i wouldnt have minded it so much but jaime losing his hand is a big event and deserves a more tense or melancholy ending themebut got is beyond mainstream and i guess we have to accept it will be prone to the marketing geniuses at hbo who try too way hard to be cooli actually thought the music was fitting given that the forced amputation completely shatters jaimes world additionally many viewers like many readers before them will have viewed jaimes declawing as calling for something more celebratory than melancholy and really if asoiaf has made it to hbo its already mainstream depending on how much of a hipster the beholder is edited by zman1863 14 april 2013  0940 pm"
"mafalda",2013-04-14,"and i loved the addition of riverrun in the opening credits"
"Warhawk137",2013-04-14,"if i were writing the episode stan  mels conversation would have gone differently although mels deadpan reaction to stans goofy i want you line was comedy gold gold jerry at least now the viewing audience knows that shadowbabies arent an unlimiteduse deus ex machinaand thank the seven for that i like my deus ex machinas to be a bit less soulrendingly horrifying and preferably accompanied by dragonswait"
"Cas Stark",2013-04-14,"i actually thought the music was fitting given that the forced amputation completely shatters jaimes world additionally many viewers like many readers before them will have viewed jaimes declawing as calling for something more celebratory than melancholy and really if asoiaf has made it to hbo its already mainstream depending on how much of a hipster the beholder isit shatters his world to the point that he comes out of a medieval setting and is shot into a modern one including a punk rock song ugh this was hbo trying too hard to be hip and failing the music for the show is fantastic and fits the setting story and mood perfectly throwing in a punk rock song was just silly"
"Carey Snow",2013-04-14,"not digging the ep as much as the above posters really disappointed with some of the changes especially the pervy way they wrote stannis and a couple of filler scenes that seriously made no sense wtf was up with that talisa scene glad they mentioned the iron bank need to watch it again to really give it a score but wasnt that impressed from first glancethey had to introduce the two lannister captives in case something happens to them cough karstark cough that way the tv audience can share robbs anger and shame"
"Dank Jedi",2013-04-14,"1010 cant really think about anything bad on this episode riverrun was awesome changing my funeral plans to a tully one and thinking about having my two nieces call me blackfish from now on gotta love seeing jorah and barristan compete for 1 queensguard little light on whats happening in the north but we all know it will get its episodes theons storyline is coming along nicely notice i didnt say poor theon like a lot of people do because he deserves everything he gets love seeing jaimes attitude towards brienne start to come out guess he does have a heart after all such a powerful moment when he lost his swordhand also who knew podrick was such a pimp anyone who hated those scenes with him tyrion and bronn i have one thing to say dont hate the playa hate the game of thrones"
"Sxxman",2013-04-14,"it shatters his world to the point that he comes out of a medieval setting and is shot into a modern one including a punk rock song ugh this was hbo trying too hard to be hip and failing the music for the show is fantastic and fits the setting story and mood perfectly throwing in a punk rock song was just sillyi didnt like the song choice but i doubt they did it to be hip and cool i mean if they were trying to make the song hip why would they use a punk rendition"
"Cas Stark",2013-04-14,"i didnt like the song choice but i doubt they did it to be hip and cool i mean if they were trying to make the song hip why would they use a punk renditionthe same reason they pulled out obscure 70s rock for the sopranos soundtrack"
"Karmarni",2013-04-14,"jaimes hand  knew it was coming but still was holding my breath agree that the bear and the maiden fair was jarring for that like the song sweet to have that version but didnt seem right for the moment think the show is picking up steam though the bouncing around does bother me a little wish i could put the story lines together liked the musical chairs scene and pods scene too chuckled at both"
"White Harbors Wrath",2013-04-14,"since they have several times used music more modern than medievalhaving a punk song that was way more folky than punk anyway is a complete non issuewe should have nitpicked probably 15 of the 23 credit song choices great choice having some ambient lute after something as epic as that ending would have been completely anti climactic"
"Buzzard16",2013-04-14,"i like the way theyre doing the whole cat and mouse with theon we know ramsey likes to do this with the woman the bait and switch with  im your friend  but im really orchestrating all this is a cool way to integrate material thats not in the books"
"DolorousKim",2013-04-14,"another pretty solid episode  i liked it as much as the first and better than the second i gave it an 8 as im a fairly hard graderwhat worked for meclive russell is looking to be an awesome blackfish if tonights episode is any indication stellar casting job once again his scene with michelle fairley was perfectionmichelle fairley gets some welldeserved props for the above scene  i havent enjoyed a cat scene so much since season onejaimie and briennes scenes were great once again and dear god the endingthe meeting of the small council and the musical chairs game some of the best actors in the series all facing off at the same time is always great viewingi enjoyed the tyrion pod and bronn scenes for the comic relief they provided this is a somber somber season so i appreciate the chuckles even if they dont move the story forward in any significant wayi was surprised that the hot pie and aryagendry farewell was actually fairly touching to me i dont recall being particularly phased when he left in the bookwhat didnt work for mestannis and mel whah since when is stannis some lovelorn horndog just begging mel for some really not liking the direction the show is taking stannis inedmure  in the books edmure is a decent kind hearted chap whos a bit on the hapless side at times in the show edmure looks like a spoiled haughty buffoon and since when is the blackfish so totally down on edmure to the point where he would shove him and diss him publicly and what was with robb snickering at edmure for missing his bow shot they are at a funeral for goodness sakes  show a little decency and decorumthe whole bastard and theon character arc  im just not buying it maybe it will improve with further developments but for now im thinking this just strains credibility a bit too much to successfully go where its supposed to be headed in the books maybe it is going in a totally different direction all together which would be a huge mistake in my opinionit also still rankles me that bran and rickon are supposedly just missing since their deaths provided such true and obvious motivations for so many things which happen in the story while their being missing does not have the same emotional resonancenot really digging the punk version of the bear and the maiden fair talk about pulling the viewer out of the ambiance of the show"
"franko99",2013-04-14,"am i the only one disappointed with that rendition of the bear and the maiden fair there are many fanmade versions in youtube waaaay better than that anyways i give this episode a 9 even the whores are better this season lol eta after reading this thread most of us didnt like how the music was used in the credits my bad for post before reading tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp  edited by franko99 14 april 2013  1014 pm"

"Ser Creighton",2013-04-14,"well i am one of the more critical viewers i gave episode 1 a 4 or 5 and episode 2 a 56 did not really enjoy either episode 3 i give an 88 the brotherhood was great riverrun and blackfish they nailed it tyrion and cersie playing musical chairs had me rolling did not see that coming pod i get the pod change and he got some props makes sense but the whole it was free thing was outstanding dany is building up to a great moment and it keeps in line with her attitude in the books during that period had me wondering n the books and even though i know i was still like whats with the attitude jamies scenes were more subtle that i thought and i actually thought they would change things and make him lose an eye really well done i had one problem stannis that was it and i just thought they butchered him but to much good to bring the grade down much also i loved the extended scenes giving the characters more time it felt far less choppy the transition from dragonstone to astapore was near perfect simple but perfect special shout out to hot pie they three kids have not gotten much time but in that moment they translated so much emotion thats tough to do considering a lack of development for that story the hound was only in it for a second but it was perfect second for him watch your head no shea  huge bonus there was emotion there was plot there was great acting and they managed to squeez in some funny moments without dumbing down the show i am waiting for it to come on again so i can watch it again just to see the look on cersies face when she moves the chair priceless that my might be the best funny moment the show has ever had although i was expecting sansatyrion and thought that was the perfect lead in and just was left waiting for it the looks that varys was throwing back and forth omg where did they come up with that so childish and yet so right you can tell tyrion thought it was childish but had to do it anyone because cersie did it and he had to one up her i telling you it was genius the looks of the people at the table cant stop laughing about it just look at there faces while all this is going on renewed faith in the series after watching this"

"Pinkie Baelish",2013-04-15,"i gave it a 9 great episode far far better than last week i was surprised that benioff did such a good job directing i expect more episodes to be done by him in the future pros daenerys scene with kraznys once again the translation bit was hilarious only because i like the curve of her ass because kraznys is generous theons scenes although i was expecting the near rape to be far more aggressive and brutal to watch i feel this is a good way to make theon feel emasculated without gelding him and ramsay being his saviour works in the long run as it works into the whole stockholm syndrome reek has speaking of which ramsay man iwan rheon is going to own this role i was a bit skeptical last week but the look on his face as he strolled over to the last dying man convinced me that hes right for the part good to see theyre making more progress on the whole ros storyline lf is yet to repay tyrion and i have a feeling that the way he does it involves ros nice foreshadowing with the iron bank better to mention it now than the future locke cutting off jaimes hand it looked gory and locke is a pretty good substitute for vargo and i felt his reasons for cutting off jaimes hand werent very irrational he just got tired of jaimes shit but im worried it came off as a bit humorous especially since such an upbeat song was played right after roose mentioned by name cat and brynden god michelle fairley is just tearing me apart if she keeps up this high level of acting the rw will be absolutely unbearable to watch i would be surprised and very disappointed if she doesnt get an emmy nom this year cersei dragging her seat over to sit next to tywin lf haters lord twatbeard is your new de facto insult i find it far better than lord pissant honestly backstory on rheagar and roberts rebellion anyone else really liked arya saying goodbye to hot pie that was the highlight for me it wasnt nowhere near as emotional in the books and i thought it was a really really nice moment i am going to miss hot pie and his ballkicking ways cryinggif classbbcemoticon altcrying  arya why didnt you give him a hug cons what the hell are they doing with stannis im fine that theyre making him a darker character than he is in the books but he is not a lecher hes a stick in the mud and lets keep it that way we are supposed to eventually root for him and if they keep this up it will be hard to do so are we still getting the barristandanyjorah confrontation they really should have addressed it last week pods scene was excessive and cheesy but hey at least it showed tyrion being a whoremonger once again is it just me or was brynden being a bit of a dick to edmure overall a really good episode oh and for any unsullied viewers that are thinking to themselves daenerys you absolute idiot i cant wait to see your faces next week edited by pinkie baelish 15 april 2013  0713 am"

"Mr Smith",2013-04-15,"i gave it an 8 this episodes biggest strength was its humour i absolutely loved the wordless banter with the chairs at the small council tyrion dragging his chair across the floor was priceless also quite enjoyed talisa assuring the lannister boys that robb only ate children on the full moon i know plenty of people didnt like the pod stuff but i thought it was great also really enjoyed dany and the fact that her thread is to the most part keeping the book dialogue as far as im concerned the best scenes of the season so far have been the ones that stuck to the book dialogue tyriontywin margerysansaolenna dany in astapor i liked that they put in tyrion explaining how the bank of braavos works always good to get that stuff in i thought theons arc picked up the pace and im happy with where theyre taking it someone said that jaimes scene was ruined by last episode as brienne beating him has played down how important losing his hand is and i agree the scene was great though particularly in the way they lulled you into a false sense of security i have two major problems with this episode the first is character assassination theyve really messed stannis up but the real disappointment was littlefinger he was never that much of a kissass in the books and he certainly wouldnt have been one to try to make it first to sit at tywins right hand theyve completely missed the point with him im afraid the second is the bear and the fucking maiden fair they got it in earlier in the episode and it was really enjoyable so why would they ruin the final scene by playing that stupid punk rock rendition really inappropriate and hugely unnecessary last little grumble mance rayder is impressing me less and less each episode"

"Toxspecific",2013-04-15,"so im watching it on couchtuner and just as the last scene with locke talking to jaime before cutting off his hand comes on some silly rock version of the bear and maiden fair song starts playing anti climax youre doing it right and the sexual tension between tyrion and cersei just seems too much we need another incest scene lol edited by toxspecific 15 april 2013  0158 am"

"SerArthurHeath",2013-04-15,"not a fan of teh last scene stylistically nor the pod scene otherwise pretty good going to have to accept the way they are changing all the characters found aidens lf voice more grating than ever as he literally chews up the scenery alla a bond villain which was quite jarring liked seeing theons escape attempt some good dialogue attempts to save mistakes made earlier in the series like jaimebrienne conversation and robb berating edmure but actually avoiding the need for these dialogues in retrospect which whilst good attempts are far clumsier than showing and telling things as they actually happen would have been preferable didnt really need to see a contortionist prostitute to be honest so a mix of pretty bloody good any scene i havent complained about but especially danys ones which is rare and pretty bad averages to 7"

"Tywin's Honour",2013-04-15,"a good solid 910 no real weakness to the episode  blackfish seems to be perfect casting exactly as i envisioned him edmure was played well but slightly more of a doofus than i had imagined  the banter between dany the slavers mormont and barristan was adequately executed i felt missandei although significantly aged up plays the demure innocent child with some ability  the small council meeting was odd i was under the impression that there was going to be some particular reason for having tywin standing there waiting for everyone to arrive as well as the arrangement of chairs but no there wasnt  i actually didnt mind the loss of pods innocence scene as some others have ive come to expect a moment of comedic respite in all the episodes and this was it  im a bit unsure as to the overall purpose of the horse heads arrangement in the wildling arc on first impression it appears to be waste of time by the others to put so much effort into such an intricate warning when the wildlings are already terrified despite not having much information about the others in the books i sincerely doubt that they would do such a thing perhaps just a dramatic piece  thoros of myr does indeed to be an amalgamation of tom o sevens etc i like  horny stannis was amazeballs and the looks mel gave him after the i want you was hilarious dashing his hopes like a lovestruck teenager"

"The Anti-Targ",2013-04-15,"7 for me i was expecting slayer didnt happen didnt particularly like clingy stannis that just felt wrong and weak jaimes hand where were the arterial spurts that was so fake is was cheesy moar blood in those situations please dumb whore scene with pod merely an interlude and a waste of time purely to get some female nudity on screen as weve been a bit light on nakedness this season breasts and vaginas on screen for no other reason than to have breasts and vaginas on screen is pathetic pod ogling ros cleavage was perfect riverrun was near perfect other than the lack of blood brienne and jaime were great arya scenes were brilliant loved the bits with the hound loved the parting with hot pie pretty good at crasters keep i hope sam gets his moment next episode astapor was great cant really fault anything there was almost an 8 but just a few too many negatives"

"SeventySeven",2013-04-15,"i gave it an 8 but it was nearly a 9 the problem i have with voting episodes as i watch them is that i always change my mind after watching the whole series and compare each episode overall so end up being much tighter in my initial voting but anywayi thought it was great pretty much all of it the parts that stand out the most were jaimebrienne which ill get to later dany im dying for her story in the next episode theon and the little snippet of arya who needs more screen time asap its not enough so far the things i disliked was the talisa scene because as much as i try i just dont care and i find her screen time wasted time and jons sloooow moving storyline im unsure about pod the stud while i understand they need to establish his attachment to tyrion because at some point it will matter it went on for too long and im not squeamish about nudity i just wish it didnt take that much time as it doesnt advance the ploti loved the ending while reading sos those jaimes chapters were always filled with so much dread but were slightly surreal at the same time and i felt the scenes on the show completely captured that feeling one minute jaime thinks hes manipulating everyone the next hes handless forever the song was very fitting too like i said it added to the chaoticsurrealbleak feel to it and jaimebrienne have by far one of the best dynamics of alleta i still dont understand the point of separating jon and ghost edited by door 15 april 2013  0849 am"

"WinterWarrior",2013-04-15,"i gave it a 9 i thought it was excellent and certainly the best of the season so far i loved the dany scenes and the we are not men response to valar morghulis i also liked the way she put mormont and selmy in their places about disagreeing with her in front of others cant wait to see dacharys i do not know where the theon story is going but it certainly is different from the books i guess they want to keep him front and center for the viewers and millesandres story  it looks like she will end up with the brotherhood and that gendry will take edric storms place i wonder how that will play out with arya since her brother is a king she has kings blood too but if the hound takes her first then she will be gone i am usually not a fan of scenes added that are not in the book but i loved the pod sequences i could even stand roz for a few seconds because it was about pod i really like his character all in all a great episode i will watch it a few more times this week i am sure"

"The Fourth Head",2013-04-15,"superb episode easily the best so far this series i gave it a 9i agree with most comments and once again the the set design and cinematic settings were breathtakingly beautiful the tully woodcarving ornamentation tyrions quarters the astapori coastine all were good enough to distract me during 53 minutes of compelling storyingi would have given it a 10 but the end credits dont work for me i understand why they did it they were probably feeling self conscious writing a mainstream show featuring themes of female rape male rape cannibalism torture and butchery of both horse and man and felt viewers needed a breath of relief at the end but for me it was a step too far i thoroughly appreciate cognitive dissonance when its done right but inappropriate levity is one thing anachronistic inapproprate levity is a big wft in my view its too far a step to feel the connection a light joyous rendition with laughter may not have relieved the horror but it would have added to the ending rather than severing it off which was perhaps the point but still it doesnt workas for the stannis scene and people calling it character assasination all ill say is that the good scenes dont wash out the bad nor the bad the good tv fans are hardly likely to forget the strong sense of justice and entitlement that he portrayed to davos in season 2 i didnt like the line i want you as it made him seem weaker than he is portrayed in the books true but taking the scene as a whole it hit all the notes as his motives were clearly about more than mere lust as we dont have a stannis pov in the books we perhaps dont fully appreciate how such a rigid man can be unfaithful to his wife and the simple explanation is that the priestess of the lord of light has seduced stannis by merging sex and power as one that emphasis was lost on me in the books due to the eyes of the people we see her through none of which have a burning desire to be king making her sexual wiles nothing more than that edited by the fourth head 15 april 2013  0950 am"

"darksellsword",2013-04-15,"i gave it 1010  im not one to overly praise episodes of the show but this was as close to perfect as the show makers can get the screenplay was both well thought out and considered the battle of chairs scene was hilarious  pod losing his virginity was funny and a nice way of showing the bond growing between tyrion and his squire the riverun scene was stunning in terms of location im irish so i tend to take for granted my countrys natural beauty but that scenery would make anyone proud to live in such a habitat the scene itself was very good  i enjoyed the black fish especially the shows writers are really taking george rr martin to school showing him just how much he missed out on by not elaborating on rob starks charecter in respect to his strategies and interactions with his commanders and troops i can just keep listing off scene after scene and say excellent after each the watch your head scene with the dog  funny  theon being chased on horse was amongst the best action sequences so far i disagree with everyone that thought the horny stannis with mellisandre scene was bad in the books they are very intimate very sensual dialouge between those two  added to that they cast a very attractive woman as the red priestess so i guess they didnt want to have stannis appear too much of a jesuit as he might if they had of gone with what was in the books between them i did see fall out from earlier deviations with jaime lannisters charecter from the novels to how they portray him on the show jaime is not a bad person he pushed bran out the window because he had to it was either bran who would die or cersei and his own children even eddard stark understood that in the show he killed alton lannister he didnt in the books the reason i bring it up is that people are viewing his hand being chopped off as being a villian getting what he deserved i feel that is a real shame and taints the complexity of jaime lannisterhe saved brienne from being gang raped because he is good at heart gwendoline christies acting is in this episode in particular was outstanding daenerys scenes were my favourite the chemistry between barristan the bold  ian mcelhinney emilia clarke daenerys iain glen jorah is fantastic and makes me very optimistic about the future of the show the whole idea of danys charecter is a journey from being sold as essentially a slave by her brother who made all of her decisions for her to learning to think for herself and believe she has what it takes to rule the world so people who say emilia clarke isnt a very good actress you must be watching a different show because shes portrayed this role with perfection the ironic thing about the punk version of the bear and the maiden fair on the end credits is that it was most likely an attempt to share the significance of the song for asoiaf readers to the people who have only watched the showin my opinion it wasnt a good idea  but a great episode edited by darksellsword 15 april 2013  1106 am"

"pleonasm",2013-04-15,"i thought it was the strongest episode of the season by far im still not a fan of where benioff and weiss are spending alot of their time  theons storyline or pods sexcapades are just eating up far too much screentime which could be served in developing some of the main characters danny jon the stark kids etc but this was a vast improvement over the last 2 episodes i did like the game of chairs it was actually a pretty funny and subtle character development scene i loved the theon horse chase sequence as well an exceptionally well crafted if not necessary scene  although it was a nod to ramseys love of hunting people although it retrospect im not sure im liking their take on ramsey i would have preferred a much colder sociopath than this warm and cuddly mind fucker they have presented so far and i didnt like the ending with ramsey killing his own men this is such tired trope in television and film people just dont kill their own minions otherwise you will never be able to have your own minions i loved the casting of the blackfish just wish he and edmure had been introduced much earlier in the series late season 1 or early season 2 i even liked a talisa scene  which is the first that has ever happened id give the episode a solid 7 edited by pleonasm 15 april 2013  0120 pm"

"Original Username",2013-04-17,"gave this an 8 slightly better than the first 2 episodes of this season gave both of those a 7 i loved the astapor  dany scenes which is a bit surprising because in the show nor in the books was she never one of my favorites the haggling for unsullied scene in particular was great the ending was very well done as well and the song didnt bother me a bit overall this episode there just wasnt really anything for me to whine about but im not going to give it a 9 or 10 because thats reserved for the truly great episodes and i do hope the rest of this season will deliver those great episodes"
"Lord of Castamere",2013-04-17,"third 8 at a row to me this episode had the highest and lowest points so far this season some scenes were absolutely great like the last one which did end in jaime loosing his hand and i loved the dynamics of the small council scenesome others like the podric scene and its follow up felt like those had little purpose while i do not mind the nudity at all bit of mixed feelings but overall a solid episode"
"Pinn",2013-04-17," but jaime losing his hand is a big event and deserves a more tense or melancholy ending themeor nothing at all else i totally agree you are taken out of the moment completely while still trying to digest the ramifications of what just happened it actually detracts from the impact of the eventpoor creative decision imo"

"Prince DragonFly",2013-04-14,"i loved the mention of the whore being able to do a merenesse knot what a nod to book readers overall i thought it was a great episode the scene with craster was awesome it was like a nod to us who read the heretic thread the scene with pod bronn and tyrion was hilarious nice to have some light hearted scenes and not have everything be so bleek last week everyone was complaining and making a stink about how they should have made it more clear that jamie was at a severe disadvantage when fighting brienne and that she made him look like a chump i think they cleared that up pretty well i think it sucks that we do not have vargo hoat and that the man who has jamie prisoner is just an unknown bolton bannerman makes no sense that a westerosi noble would cut off his hand really considering jamies worth from a ransom and his worth to robb and roose vargo hoat at least was a savage who didnt care i thought the introduction to the blackfish and edmure stayed true to the essence of the books despite the obvious plot difference i think it is obvious that karstark will kill the lannister boys or else why show them the next episode is going to be epic we will get danys dracarys the nw mutiny and much much more the exposition and set up is finally over with this episode the stage is set"

"congokong",2013-04-14,"from a purist standpoint i wasnt happy as usual i continue to wish theon would just disappear for 2 seasons the podrick scenes were imo a waste of time too much sex talk and i cant picture stannis behaving the way he did with anyone positives the last scene was great even though i think they should stick to the books whenever they can i feel they did indeed improve on the source material in that last scene"
"Uldan",2013-04-14,"i might be alone in this but i feel that while stannis comes off super weak mel straight out tells him he is being weak by saying your fires burn low i think its a pretty normal and human reaction to such a crushing defeat while its not totally true to his character progression through the novels i still have faith well see the hard ass stannis that many of us love"

"Khal Pono",2013-04-14,"the problem with that is that if we saw more of stannis than we could have a better feel for his overall character and how he is unfortunately all we are seeing of him is this bitchy guy complaining and begging mel to give him stuff like hes six and she has the quarters to his favorite arcade game if they gave satnnis more facetime i would be able to forgive it but they do not have that kind of time to give him so they just make him whiney and petulant mehlike i said i get that he is weakening but that does not mean he should be a weaklingnot entirely true we see that stannis is a wreck that he mourns renly not bitching that renly laghed at him and that he will not take retribution out on his lesser supporters the scene where he is advuised to invade and butcher a small island that went back over to joff stannis wisely refuses we see that he is still in command still leading no quit in him he also listens to davos kind of important that he is working and that he refuses to kill edric storm to please mel this is hardly the same guy who chaes mel to the beack to beg her for some nooky and to make another shadow babyhowever do not mistake me it cant be like the book i accept that certain changes need tp be made and time is of the essence i just think there was a more reasonable and effctive way to present stannis than what we sawstannis is one of the most whiny petulant characters in the books especially book 2 all he does is complain about his brothers and all the shit they got and that he didnt get hes a miserable jealous resentful and bitter never understood all the stannis love on this board"

"ohpooratlas",2013-04-15,"loved the episode im really curious to see how nonbook readers react to dany saying shell give away a dragon for all the unsullied i remember the first time reading the books and getting soooooo mad at her and then of course she burns the city to the ground and it is my favorite chapter in the entire series cant wait for next week x  the streaming version i watched of the episode had the rock version of the bear and the maiden fair kick in right as the knife is at jaimes eye so it was really jarring and not in a good way for me im guessing this is not how the episode actually aired theyre doing a really good job in completely misrepresenting ramsays character i cant wait for the big reveal when it finally comes the only thing i did not like was the stannis scene i had been giving him the benefit of the doubt in the first episode this season but the change is just  weird i would have been fine if they just ended the scene with mel telling him another shadow baby would kill him didnt think we needed the next stannis line after that all in all a solid episode i cant wait for the next biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd "

saying he got what he deserved whereas i was like noooooooooooowatching it happen is so different than reading it i think my imagination played it downits because you dont even know what happens the chapter ends with the darthanki swinging his blade down and jaime screamed its a couple hundred pages before the next jaime chapter that reveals his hand was cut offwowshowrunners put the meereenese knot in what a great easter eggvery good episode definitely the best in this young season the blackfish was suitably baddass and edmure dullwitted lulz over pod wellendowed he and that last scene wow you have to wonder how far along those rapers got with brienne sadpng classbbcemoticon alt  and even though i knew it was coming jaimes end was greatawfulbrienne still seems to have her clothes on so not far i guessone thing i didnt understand that little talisa scene with the lannister hostagesare they truthfully setting her up as a spyyes obviously just like the pw is clearly this season because they mention the cost of iton a serious note i think shes just trying to make polite conversation with them and its a good setup dont worry herobb doesnt harm little boyswonder whats gonna piss karstark off so bad that he kills the lannister hostages cant remember if he has kids in this show or nothes got nothing left now all his sons died fighting a war that seems pretty hopeless right now all that is driving him is revenge we see many examples of this in the books the huntsman that captures the hound wants to throw him into a crow cage and let him rot lord wyman wants to kill freys and bathe in their blood as hes dyingand then theres what catelyn stark becomes karstark in the show tells catelyn he would gladly tear his heart out of his chest if it would bring his sons back to life and let them be stuck in captivity like her daughters arei was wondering what was arya talking about when she said to the hound do you remember the last time you were here after reading this i remembered she does not stop talking to him about what he did to micah from season 1i was like what when has arya seen the hound outside of the castleim posting way too much but this episode was really goodshe saw the hound at winterfell when the king visited and they traveled together back to kl that place was one of the places they stoppedhot pie was cute does he still not realize aryas a girl he said brother of a kinghot pie says im no brother of a king  aryas brother is a kingit does sound like he says arry when he says goodbye perhaps he didnt learn her first name after alli have a feeling they are going to leave the greyjoys out the show stannis only said i want joffrey and robb dead so i dont think we are going to see balon greyjoys fly off the bridge i was eager to see that scene no dead balon no kingsmoot no euron no victarion  or maybe they are keeping this for later when some of the old characters will be deadi saw about a one second clip of yara from this season balon would die this season if they follow the books its the whole reason robb sees the opportunity to get north again and the reason he goes to the twins in the first place the kingsmoot wouldnt happen until next season it gets called but it takes awhile for all the captains to get to old wykperhaps stannis isnt even worried about the ironborne at this point he did destroy their fleet in the greyjoy rebellion so im sure he believes he can take care of them again no problem good to see riverunn in the credits and just a qustion when robb was yelling at edmure was he talking about tywin or the mountain cause tywin is all the way in kings landing also it was nice to see the lannister boys martin and the other one didnt like that talisa isnt acting liek a proper queen and that the freys leaving is still not mentioned and i definitly didnt like that she tells them robb stark turns into a wolf whats the point of that it will only make robb seem like a monster i loved the ending locke is one hell of an actor and jaimes reaction before the credits pricelessrobb is talking about how he had a trap set for the mountain they wouldve surrounded him and killed him he also explains that tywin lannister doesnt need his men as badly as they do because theyre greatly outnumberedwhy did pod get the whore services for freehepod saved my life so i tyrion owe him a small amount yes  did he just make a dwarf pun at himselfilittlefinger owe you as well its said you helped my red hedded associate out of some trouble with the queenso tyrion owes pod and littlefinger owes tyrion therefore tyrion doesnt have to pay for pods rewardtyrion might have figured it out but bronn certainly probably couldnt connect the dots so he goes along with it to give the boy some confidencethere are no masters in the grave and the slave praying for death an interesting call back to the origin of the faceless mencall forward actually isnt it since the show hasnt gotten that far yetnice catch though it also probably strengthens danys resolve since that slave would rather be dead than a slave questions from episode 3 i need clearing up1 since when do the white walkers arrange the dead in the shape of universes i dont remember this from the bookssince the first scene of nw that go beyond the wall in the first episode in the first season2 why is tormond going over the wall wasnt it someone else in the book cant remember does this mean tormond is going to die i hope not he hasnt even talked about his biological advantages yetit gives him something to do this season i hope they dont alter him becoming king later on3 what the eff is ghost doing4 when is samwell going to kill the wight5 where are they making stannis out to be a bitch6 ramsay told theon winter is coming wtf7 locke seems like a good character for the show and all but why replace the bloody mummers was really looking forward to seeing the leader of those dudes on screen would have made a great character maybe they couldnt find an actor good enough to pull off that role8 why so much hate for the song at the end thought it was both great and equally as shocking as jaime parting ways with his sword hand9 lastly who gives a rip if stuff in the show deviates from the book i like the changes its not supposed to be exactly like the book if it was it would be difficult to watch the pod stuff was great it showed tyrion and bronn are just dudes who want to know details of this pods great sexcapade now i wouldt put it past tyrion to have the whole thing set up that way to make pod feel good about himself you know come out of his shell a little bit3 scouting for wights i have no clue really4 sam doesnt kill a wight he kills a white walker probably when one is stupid enough to challenge the slayer im guessing it comes after him and gilly and the baby and he protects them5 he just got pwned hes a little bit depressed right now did you see the pile of notes on his table6 every northman knows the stark words7 changes

"moey reed",2013-04-15,"the bear and the maiden fair cracked me up both times the first time it made me laugh because the bolton men were such improbably good singers the second time it made me laugh was that punk rock version played right after jaime lannister lost his hand it was such a random juxtaposition that it was weirdly hilariousthe guy singing it the first time is the singer of snow patrol if im not mistakenthere were news while filming that he would make a cameo winkpng classbbcemoticon alt i enjoyed this episodeespecially you little bastard all theon scenes actually the acting is so good that im really really dreading whats comingpoor fellaim really disappointed what theyve done beyond the wall  in the north thoughthose are my favorite parts in the books and theres still no sam the slayer sadpng classbbcemoticon alt  i dont know it just seems as if the writers dont think the world beyond the wall or the north is very important i also dont like what theyve done to mancei always imagined him as someone not so super warriorlike like in the show im still waiting for mance the bardand worst of all nothing about tormunds member tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp im still excited for the rest of the season though"
"Justin Danford",2013-04-15,"soooobasically locke chops jaimies hand during a fit of jealous rage feeling inadequate next to jamies fancy words and riches and looks etc  and probably without fully thinking out the consequences before he did iti mean he just ordered brienne to be left unharmed in order to preserve her value as a swap so why else would he turn around and harm jamie an even more valuable prisonersaw a lot of posts to this point but i didnt see anyone really hit it on the headits not that locke is dumb jealous or rage full  its that locke doesnt intend to ransom jamie at all he tells them that at the end of ep2 when jamie says he is worth riches as far as locke is concerned hell bring jamie back to roose roose will send him to robb where he will be beheaded for his crimes a beheading goes just as well whether or not the prisoner has 1 or 2 handson the otherhand had to there was no mention of brienne she is not a fugitive only a new prisoner thanks to jamie she now has ransom value and so is kept unbesmirched not defiledthis i feel is an improvement to the source material you sum up the whole motive for the behanding by simply saying that a northman sworn to a bannerman of the king in the north would obviously assume the lord he is loyal to would not want to be on the lannisters good side roose ought to be fine with a 1 handed jamie if roose was loyal since roose has some other motives howeverlocke thus introduces a few plot points and will help wrap that whole thing up nicely when the viewers consider it in retrospect edited by justin danford 15 april 2013  0532 am"
"Justin Danford",2013-04-15,"i have a feeling they are going to leave the greyjoys out the show stannis only said i want joffrey and robb dead so i dont think we are going to see balon greyjoys fly off the bridge i was eager to see that scene no dead balon no kingsmoot no euron no victarion  or maybe they are keeping this for later when some of the old characters will be deadi think this is a plotline for s4 when as you say the cast will be a few heads lighter i also think its a nice line for ramsey to deliver to theon right after he betrays him or is torturing him and by the way your father is dead edited by justin danford 15 april 2013  0529 am"

"Volantis",2013-04-15,"what did stannis do to deserve this treatment"
"SerArthurHeath",2013-04-15,"it seems from the first jaimebrienne scene here their whole jaime being overrated at fighting was a deliberate point by the directing team i think i prefer that to it just being a result of inadequate direction"
"-Ghost-",2013-04-15,"that was a great fucking episode the blackfish is awesome i liked that they kept the watch for me little cat line not a fan of that stannis scene jaimes hand was great"

"bayrodney",2013-04-15,"please direct me in the right direction if it has been discussed before but i thought leading up to this episode they promoted that both david benioff and db weiss were directing this episode in the opening credits they only had benioffs name or am i wrong"
"Rockroi",2013-04-15,"maybe because its only episode 3 of a 10 episode season this isnt the last time we see stannis and character development is something that happens over timeyeah except that stannis has had so little screen time understandably and they decide to focus on him being bitchy and whiney not terribly convincing now in defence of the scene i will say that stannis really does not really jumpup in true conciousness until deep into book 3 so i can definately see what your point it here at the same time my concern is that they are choosing very very questionable ways to detail stannis and him being a petulant brat is not that compelling now one last point to try to salvage what i thought was the worst scene in the episode namely that for viewers of the show who saw stannis morph a shadow and kill renly they must be asking themselves jesus christ stannis just make another shadow baby and put an end to this well the show has to provide context as to why he is not taking that course of action in the books its only hinted at here the show has to spell it out otherwise they would constantly be complaining that stannis could just fireup a shadow so in that limited context i can understand why the show felt the need to make that clear via the dialog provided still a very weak scene though"
"jmk51",2013-04-15,"besides the usual book deviation whining i thought the opening scene between blackfishedmure was perfect established blackfish as a bad as and edmure as incompetent in 3 minutes"
"Warhawk137",2013-04-15,"i think this is a plotline for s4 when as you say the cast will be a few heads lighter i also think its a nice line for ramsey to deliver to theon right after he betrays him or is torturing him and by the way your father is deadyeah looks to be some herdculling toward the end of this season and the beginning of the nextshould give dd time to tyrell and greyjoy it up in this hizzouse"
"Rockroi",2013-04-15,"now to answer some questions1 since when do the white walkers arrange the dead in the shape of universes i dont remember this from the booksnothing like this is described in the books however the show has made it a point to express the visual work of the others made especially in the opening scene of the series i particularly like it because its clear and dramatic evidence that the white walkers are more than just mindless zombies but have more style and possibly more substance 2 why is tormond going over the wall wasnt it someone else in the book cant remember does this mean tormond is going to die i hope not he hasnt even talked about his biological advantages yettormond is an amalgamation of several characters from beyond the wall and i really like it i like that he is scene as a megatough guy and sort of an impish teller of talltales i like the balance iirc he never went beyond the wall in book 3 but i could be mistaken3 what the eff is ghost doingmany are saying that he was hunting wights i got a completely different vibe here to me ghost is not going back to casters keep because jon snow hated the place once jon learned what was going on there ghost sort of said this is a place that even men think is fucked i am staying away and that scene with tarly is as if he is saying to sam   and you should stay away from this place too 4 when is samwell going to kill the wighthe may never which i think is a mistake i think the whole flight from the fist has been halfassed and i know why to do the scene as it was in the books would have been far far too expensive but if he is it will be in defending gilly and the baby either at crasters or soon thereafter 5 where are they making stannis out to be a bitchi think i have answered this question enough 6 ramsay told theon winter is coming wtfkind of a giveaway there a the same time i think ramsey is toying with theon insofar as he is trying to guage whether or not theon is ironborn truly or is more northerner the words of house stark may give him some insight there 7 locke seems like a good character for the show and all but why replace the bloody mummers was really looking forward to seeing the leader of those dudes on screen would have made a great character maybe they couldnt find an actor good enough to pull off that rolei think because to make another troupe and give an entire different group an identity would require developing more characters give more dialog to more actors and expand the footprint of that part of the story which would take up much more time than the show can expend in a perfect world i would have loved to have seen that group of crazies blustering through westeroes but i sort of understand why they have not gone that way here 8 why so much hate for the song at the end thought it was both great and equally as shocking as jaime parting ways with his sword handagreed9 lastly who gives a rip if stuff in the show deviates from the book i like the changes its not supposed to be exactly like the book if it was it would be difficult to watch the pod stuff was great it showed tyrion and bronn are just dudes who want to know details of this pods great sexcapade now i wouldt put it past tyrion to have the whole thing set up that way to make pod feel good about himself you know come out of his shell a little bitthese are two different thoughts i think the pod scene was fun funny nicely done and a very very welcome addition i also think that the show can be very good by being different from the book there have been a myriad of examples of the show adding a great deal to the story by veering away from what was in the books a brief and incomplete list of examplesrobert and cerseis five v one discussion in season 1stannis and davos ate the horses first dialogany scene with natalie dormer as maergery tyrell she is incrediblethe conflation of the shadow baby and the death of renly scenes excellent time saving there the introduction of the reeds now instead of earlier where they would have muddled the storyviserys coming to life far more completely than in the booksi also understand that certain things that i loved in the books cannot be included in the show because well its only ten hours maybe the biggest example of this was the lovemaking scene between irri and dany the tower of joy scene in game of thrones that has been abandoned i understand why they did it even if i would have really wanted to see that scene and that it is very important to the explination of the series jon snow ned stark and how fucked up this place got but but but but but but that does not mean every addition is welcome or that i have to like something different mearly becxause well this isnt the book so blah blah blah blah different does not always mean better its sometimes just different for me i can criticize something on the merits and not merely because it was not in the book and be rational about it quarth was not in the books it was a terrible part of the second season and almost dragged the whole thing down i dont likethis reimagined version of stannis just as i did not like the reimagined version of renly book renly was dashing showrenly was a child i can like certain things on the merits just as i can dislike certain things on the meritsfinally everyone has to remember one thing the book works it worked so well that it sold millions of copies and generated huge fan interest to the point that it begat the show therefore if you are going to change the books it should be for a good reason and most of the time the reason is really good budget story constraints time but that does not always mean i have to like it for me i look at the show as an alternate reality westroes  some things have changed some have stayed the same and i judge each bit of it on its own nothing wrong with that"
"Cas Stark",2013-04-15,"not everything they do that doesnt come from the books is annoying the pod scene was annoying because it a serves no plot purpose it doesnt show us anything about the characters or advance the story in any wayand coolpng classbbcemoticon altb  it is doubly annoying to take time away from important plot points for a long scene that does nothing to advance the plot or show any insight yes the merenese knot line was a nice insider joke but it wasnt worth the very long scene that could have been used for example to make the aryahot piebwb scene longer and more poignant i had no problem wthe moving the chair scene because it was showing you something about the duel for power how tywin lannister holds all the power now and eveyrone else is a toady and how cersei and tyrion are in competition and it did also advance the plot because tyrion got named master of coin"

"Drowningfish2304",2013-04-15,"the episode was one of the best so far this season in my opinion though there were a few gripesi enjoyedthe jaime and brienne scenes the one near the start on the horse and the brilliant one at the end where jaime talks locke out of having the men rape brienne and then his hand being cut off at the end was brilliantly donethe scene between arya gendry and hot pie it was emotive and made me feel something which is always lovelythe scene between the council at kings landing the awkward start it was just like the books which is something i always like to see and then later the tyrion  littlefinger talk about being master of coin was great because i saw the link between that and the banking in todays worldthe scene between catelyn and the blackfish beautifully scripted capturing catelyns grief wonderfully and introducing the blackfishs character nicelythe scene with jon at the fist with the weird horses and mance i just love his character i did want to see a bit more of ygritte though she hasnt been made of as much importance so far in the season as id likethe walk of punishment scene with jorah dany and barristan i loved the jorah quotes and the clash of personalities and it was just nicei didnt enjoythe scene of the nights watch at crasters it just seemed a bit cold and lifeless it just wasnt that exciting to watch though its exactly the way it should be really i just would have liked to see the white walkers a bit morethe theon scenes i have no idea what they are doing with this story but i dont really care for it and i dont think many people do theons story in season 2 was brilliant but this one is just taking up valuable screen time that could be used on other thingsthe scene between stannis and melisandre very dull and i dont know what theyre doing with this story either but i dont care for it too much whatever is happeningthe scene with tyrion bronn and pod i just found it to be extremely pointless adding humour to the show that just isnt needed there are so many things they could have done with those 510 minutes and its all wasted on nothing no character development in any way either i think of tyrion bronn and pod in exactly the same way as i did before that scene its just time wasted for gratuitous nudity in my opinionscenes im not sure aboutthe funeral scene that began the episode i enjoyed the scene but the characterization of edmure was a bit odd and i dont really like the way the storyline for robb  catelyn has been mixed around and rushed in some parts where its gone too slowly in other parts i think its just the bookenthusiast in me that made me have mixed feelings about that scenethe daenerys scene meeting with the master slaver the scene was alright it happened a bit too quickly though and made me think about how danys story this season has been rushed 10x more than it should have been theyve gone through about 3 or 4 chapters in 3 episodes and they have about 1 or 2 more to go through in 7 episodes they need to take it much slower with daenerys i would have liked more talk with jorah and barristan about the unsullied more advice giving the scene has just made her look like a ruthless naive girl and she is a bit but not as much as she is portrayed so in the showscenes i would have likedsome development between the jon  ygritte relationship i was looking forward to their little romance arc this season and i dont know whether it will be as powerful as i imagined now because theres been nothing between them all these 3 episodes where is the love theyve given the most minimalistic approach to jons arc so far and replaced what could have been with gratuitous nudity and unneeded laddism between bronn and tyrion it could have been replaced by a nice conversationflirting between ygritte and jon like the sort of stuff that was in the end of season 2 between thema conversation between arya and thoros thoros hasnt told them both where hes going yet im sure viewers would like to know the direction arya is going in this season give them some hope maybe with him telling her hes taking her to riverrun to her parents or maybe just a conversation about thoros relationship with the starks i want some more characterization for thorosmore characterization for jojen and meera too jojen has been introduced as this mysterious boy and i hope he doesnt just have that sort of role in the whole of the season people were expecting jojen and meera to show up in season 2 dd arent exactly making up for that fact so far wheres all the character development that took up a lot of a clash of kings and the first part of a storm of swords they could have saved the last dany scene for a later episode and took some time to introduce these new characters that theyve just thrown at the viewers how do they expect the viewers to keep up with the show when they hardly know who most of these new characters are"

overwhelming to the nonbook readers sparing energy to remember one more noble house but they just may get used to it edmure not being able to shoot the arrow straight to the target was a nice touch brynden was spot on i remember vaguely in the books that edmures impatient actions cost robb e great victory over tiwin not over the mountain but i didnt get it in the books either so i guess here it has been simplified to the tv viewers with the straightforward kill the mountain so i guess it was a fine and necessary change im just hoping that the north isnt introduced further as weakened so the impact of the rw would be bigger one funny council  here comes one of the best scenes in the episode full of subtle moments the old council with the new old hand so we could see how they would react around the new boss i liked it how after the initial hesitance littlefinger reacted fast and got the best place although i presume varys was like ok have the chair well see who gets the really important things cerses narcissistic nature was shown only in one simple action like the moving of the chair i always wondered about tiwins attitude to his daughter i always thought he was way too patient and tolerable of her incompetence and as usual tyrion is the one to express openly his opinion with sarcasm and witty comments the chair dragging scene reminds me of one hilarious scene form johnny english 2 it really had me laughing and it brought some freshness to the show the bear and the maiden fair  another great song from the books was given life with very nice and suitable reference to jaime and brienne although in this case the maiden fair looks like a bear the scenes with jaime and brienne remain one of the strongest yet and ncw is nailing the part he was really irritating at the beginning of the series but now is showing truly how his character evolves the stark from winterhell  this was another good one smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  bye bye hot pie you served your role well and we get to see how sentimental gendry is im willing to see a bit more of aryas storyline tho i know that not much is happening with her in the book either but dang is she cool family reunion  catelyns little moment was actually quite moving not much to say here it was alright tho the young wolf  that was an interesting scene we get to hear about the legends how robb turned into wolf at night which was actually quite interesting for me ive always considered it as some kind of reference that robb was a warg too but away from that it was just a cool scene for scared little boys quite the artists  so we are back to the wildling camp i read some complaining about kits acting and jons part im completely fine with kit he did very well in season 1 but since then the show runners are giving his character not much of an action i got the feeling that jon snows part has been kept low profile for a reason if thats not the case that is just poorly written since hes my favorite in the books i sincerely hope we get to see more consistent wildling plot and not just some random plot scenes nice touch with the ww art very david fincher style i might say the changed situation at crasters keep  for the first time we get to see how miserable the nw actually is craster may act that nothing has changed but we can see that the nice nw is not so nice anymore the subtle looks and the nervous environment point to some coming menace which does not necessarily comes from the outside i just hope we still get to see sam the slayer winter is coming  the winter is coming and the bastard references were really great references for the die hard fans of the series ive read the books but am just as curious how theons story will continue form now on but am pretty sure weve met ramsey already stannis  ohhh the pity  why dramatic screaming towards the sky why on earth destroying such a nice written character i still have no clue whatsoever just  speechless the queen or the don  and the family has chosen the new don dany is having some awesome parts this season im not a fan of hers in the books but here in season 3 i really find her charismatic and interesting her storyarc promises to be well handled consistent and properly written i liked it how jorah and ser barristan were the two sides of the same coin dany really is ready to kick some slaveholders as the rhaegar mentioning almost got me jumping on my chair from joy my boyfriend thinks im a total geek now the meereenese knot  well well well  look who got laid podrick is not so lame anymore although the prostitutes may have been paid to lie i prefer to leave it the way it is and think of pod as of some really cool guy from now on it was a bit of unnecessary scene but pretty fresh tho imho there must be such a refreshing and funny scene now and then its not always about the drama and the plots the onehanded knight  as soon as i saw the final scene coming my stomach dropped i felt really horrible about jaime the final scene was intense although im not sure if it was as much of a shock for the nonbook readers but i somehow missed the motivation behind lockes decision to cut jaimes hand of was he irritated by jaimes selfindulgent behavior was that a reason good enough to cut his hand of and not fear lord tiwins revenge it has been a while since ive read the books so i cant recall the exact scene there either bur it was well handled and i definitely felt the tension the rocky song at the and had a little dissonance with the cutting scene which created a nice contrast edited spelling

references were really great references for the die hard fans of the series ive read the books but am just as curious how theons story will continue form now on but am pretty sure weve met ramsey alreadystannis  ohhh the pity  why dramatic screaming towards the sky why on earth destroying such a nice written character i still have no clue whatsoever just  speechlessthe queen or the don  and the family has chosen the new don dany is having some awesome parts this season im not a fan of hers in the books but here in season 3 i really find her charismatic and interesting her storyarc promises to be well handled consistent and properly written i liked it how jorah and ser barristan were the two sides of the same coin dany really is ready to kick some slaveholders as the rhaegar mentioning almost got me jumping on my chair from joy my boyfriend thinks im a total geek nowthe meereenese knot  well well well  look who got laid podrick is not so lame anymore although the prostitutes may have been paid to lie i prefer to leave it the way it is and think of pod as of some really cool guy from now on it was a bit of unnecessary scene but pretty fresh tho imho there must be such a refreshing and funny scene now and then its not always about the drama and the plotsthe onehanded knight  as soon as i saw the final scene coming my stomach dropped i felt really horrible about jaime the final scene was intense although im not sure if it was as much of a shock for the nonbook readers but i somehow missed the motivation behind lockes decision to cut jaimes hand of was he irritated by jaimes selfindulgent behavior was that a reason good enough to cut his hand of and not fear lord tiwins revenge it has been a while since ive read the books so i cant recall the exact scene there either bur it was well handled and i definitely felt the tension the rocky song at the and had a little dissonance with the cutting scene which created a nice contrastedited spellingi thought that aside from a few things this was a pretty great episodei really did not like the podwhores scene such a waste of time that could have been spent elsewhere with far more deserving characters and storylines im not even sure pod got laid thoughriverrun and council scenes were great cat was actually good in her scene with blackfish blackfish was great as was the whole funeral scene i really did not like how nothing was mentioned about edmures blunder impacting the battle of the blackwater so drastically but the rest of it was greatwe should be in for a hell of a time at crasters keep next episodedanys storyline has been good so far and will explode next episode i think fans will really start to like her this season like maybe book readers started to like her in asos i thought the whole talk about rhaegar with dany barristan and jorah was great tooramsey is certainly playing an extended game with theon im inclined to believe they werent even athe dreadfort initially but ramsey is leading theon to the dreadfort judging by next weeks preview we really need to see some flaying and dismembering as gruesome as that isthe jaime scene at the end was great about lockes motivation being flimsy well vargo wasnt necessarily the smartest guy either vargo thought cutting off jaimes hand meant to send the message to tywin that he meant business real smart move there edited by ckal 15 april 2013  0443 pm"
"PhoenixFlame",2013-04-15,"it was not smart but locke was operating off two things one jaime will always be a valuable prisoner onehanded or not it is not like a ransom would be refused or drastically lowered because of his maiming two he reaaally hates jaime and got carried away what he probably does not realize is that roose does not like flashy displays of sadism oh related to that as awful as it was to hear brienne screaming i love that you kept hearing the men shriek in pain even as overpowered as she was she was still kicking ass they would have worn her down if jaime had not intervened but i bet a few dudes went to bed with bruised junk i have no problem with the stannis scene he is at rock bottom and depressed the only thing he has going for him is melisandre i think they are emphasizing what a low place he is in so his eventual big damn heroes moment is more spectacular edited by phoenixflame 15 april 2013  0530 pm"
"FattyPeon",2013-04-15,"people hyperventilating over the stannis scene need to calm downwe never saw them alone in the book he spends all of his time with her after blackwater usually alone with her hes an utterly defeated man at the moment desperate and depressed but of course she is the only one who gets to see him in that state ever he still maintains the rigid stern clenchedjaw exterior among others and it feels quite natural to me that he would drop the facade in the moment that she is abandoning himseems to me that some of you guys are the ones who have stannis figured wrong hes not bereft of feelings hes rather the opposite too sensitive"
"Lyana",2013-04-15,"my predictions for next weeks episode stannis makes mel a mixtape and sends her a raven saying do you like me yes no blackfish gives edmure a wedgie pod starts wearing a thick gold chain slicks his hair back and wears way too much cologne we learn that brienne was field nurse before taking up sword fighting and closes off jamies stump since im pretty sure count ruganlocke doesnt have a maester in his camp ala qyburneven with those predictions im sure the show will be amazing attempt to reduce my trolling footprintlol im down with that"

"FattyPeon",2013-04-15,"you say he was a hero at blackwater and now all of a sudden he is whiny and weak what do you mean all of a sudden he lost at blackwater lol he was crushed and shamed he went to kl as a substantial favourite to win and then he had to retreat from his birthrightgloryjustice etc etc etc and now he sits idle in dragonstone without the mengoldanything necessary to try again not sure whats so all of a sudden here"

"MSUMC25",2013-04-15,"i dont get why a lot of people were freaking out over the stannis scene either i thought it showed him at rock bottom and in the 3rd book stannis disappears through the middle and ends up north of the wall at the end which was totally from left field but still awesome the tv series just bluntly shows that he is a little p whipped from melisandre which makes sense because shes by his side 247 telling him how great he is going to be and then leaves him at rock bottom it also makes sens because we know their relationship is also a physical onea man has needs and would not like his women going off to god knows where i think her leaving is a must so stannis stops sulking gets off his  and starts planning his invasion"

acrossbad stuffbrienne and jaime had no respect for the others fighting which is a massive shame i loved the mutual respect they had in the booksthen robb and the blackfish believe bran and rickon are alive no just nostannis and mel scene was just odd sets up the gendry thing though but the worst thing was stannis wants the baby he has no remorse about his brother big change from the books dont like one bithe showed remorse about it last season when hes about to kill mel i killed my brotherdany didnt share her plan with barristan and jorah not sure about that then her being commanding just seems very wooden still not convinced by ecshe does the same thing in the books she needs them to react the way they do or something might not have smelled rightafter dany has acquired missandei as her girl fridayright out of the bookmissandeivalar morghulisdanyall men must servenot in the bookdany looks at missandeidanywe are not menmissandei mild smiled and d  that was a good onevalar morghulis means all men must die valar dohaeris means all men must servei watch every week with 3 non book readers i was waiting the entire episode for sam the slayer the reveal of ramsay guess that wont be for a while jamies hand and dany to reveal her understand of kraznyssp when do the more seasoned readers expect these things to happen i cant remember exactly when she revealed she could understand him but i thought it was during the negotiating i guess that was all one scene in the book though anyonethe reader knows from the get go that she understands him because were inside danys head in the book she reveals it to one of the slavers the rest are too distracted because they have a freaking dragon as soon as the transaction is complete she starts screaming it is done you are mine bought and paid for it is done in valaryiani feel like it did it showed her watching him after she came back and sat down i think she understood that he talked them out of it she must have understood that something happened in order to go from full rape to chillin by a treeyeap it becomes pretty obvious because shes silent she cant really talk to jaime about why he lied for her but when she gets a chance im sure shell askjust watched it again and i couldnt help but chuckle at the jon wildlings scene i kept picturing the white walkers all placing random horse parts in a pattern then giggling as they tip toed away why the patternwhy do they let will go so he can tell people that they have returned why did they let sam go they arent just mindless zombies they want people to know that theyre out theredoes anyone know if beric dondarrions been cast this season i know strong belwas isnt sadpng classbbcemoticon alt  but im still holding out hope for him who else will beat the champion of mereen or whatever they call himso when do we think lady stoneheart will appear since book 3 will run into next season do you guys think she will appear then or this season id love for them to have her appear at the very end of episode 10 this season like even after the credits it would be amazingberic is going to be in the next episode my guess is if they do a champion single combat scene for mareen it will be barristan so we can finally see why hes the greatest knight ever jorah and daario are also possibilities it will probably not happen this season though sadlyand does anyone here know anything about cgi i wonder why its so expensive i thought it was just kind of similar to computer animation or something because im wondering why we only ever see one of danys dragons when she has three we never see um viseron and rhaegal i forget their names because we only ever hear about drogonalso i have no idea what robb and the tullys were talking about i must have breezed over that part in the booksi didnt have a problem with the rock bear and maiden fair i thought it was a cool version it was just a little odd following jaimes behandingits different in the books but basically after robb lifts jaime lannisters seige at riverrun he tells his uncle edmure to hold it edmure does hold it but he also attacks the mountainim wondering how the nonbook readers are handing the tully introduction this is the first we ever heard on the show that robb is king of the riverlands as well as the north and thats a pretty big deal it makes it kinda weird that we havent heard of any riverland soldiers in his army up to this pointrobb lifted jaime lannisters seige at riverrun season one and captured him lifting the siege brought all the lords of the riverlands into the war against the lannnistersvery shortly later ned is beheaded and the lords are discussing stannisjoffreyrenly etc thats when robb is given his crown and declared king in the northhowever since they helped the riverlands allied with freys through promises of marriage and riverrun the riverlands are part of their kingdomking in the north and riverlands just doesnt sound as cool edited

"MisunderstoodFrey",2013-04-16,"on lockewhose to say locke isnt a sellsword hired by roose i think this a oppose to him being some knight or his lieutenant is reasonable all we know is that he is rooses hunter as a sellsword it would establish an additional tie to vargo explained by his poorer upbringing also it alleviates him from the responsibility of thinking about the political implications of jaime on the other hand he is directly planning on ransoming brienne so the treatment of jaime isnt hypocritical considering the butterfly effect of taking the bloody mummers out last season this seems as true to the books as you can get if you ask mehe carries the bolton banner so do his men all of whom refer to him as lord they wouldnt bother with this if he was a sellsword and also they are obviously trying to incorporate bolton men as much as possible"

"ShigellaSand",2013-04-16,"in general a very good episode loved the small council scene with the chairs of course and the ending very good jaimebrienne scenes across the board the whorehouse scene felt pointless but i did enjoy the bonding afterwards setting things up both to strengthen the tyrionpod bond and to make it sting even more for tyrion when bronn wont be his champion against the mountain i liked the farewell to hot pie  even if it did make me worry for him simple contentment just doesnt happen in westeros the treatment of edmure was too harsh i think doesnt he get even a shred of sympathy for just having lost his father instead he gets shoved aside by the blackfish and yelled at by robb and then hes not even included in the remembering hoster scene between catelyn and the blackfish i hope he gets some more nuanced stuff in upcoming episodes also did not like the stannis scene im not going to say hes ruined based on one scene but i hope its not the start of a trend"

"Jon Icefyre",2013-04-16,"again to reiterate the point is that barristan has decades of experience of controlling what he says thats why its out of characterdo you not realise that dany wanted barristan and jorah to react like that if they acted like they didnt care kraznys would not believe her but she schools them afterwards so that they dont do it again dany needed them to make a scene but she needed them to know not to do it again she used her knowledge of their personalities to her political advantage and she used it as an opportunity to teach them a lesson it was a very smart move and shows her political awarenessalso lol dany owes barristan nothing and shed easily win westeros without him she has three dragons one knight isnt going to make a difference so maybe you should think a little bit harder before you post anything about daenerys in futurefirst of all she has three dragons that are nowhere near as large as aegon ls at this point in the tv series those dragons wouldnt do shit in westeros and to even get to westeros she has to first survive essos do you think she would still believe alive even at this point if she didnt have ser barristan or ser jorah with her if ser jorah wasnt with her then she would certainly have been dead in the first season and ser barristan saved her ass in the first episode of the third season so youre argument is beyond absurd i obviously know why dany did what she did im no rookie to this story what im saying is i understand why ser barristan reacted the way he did and there was no need for dany to bitch him out afterwords for just looking after her best intrests especially if his intial react was one she was trying to create to begin withdany would not easily win westeros without ser barristan hell she cant even get there now and her dragons are not nearly as fearsome as you might think they are even if we go as far as the 5th book with danys dragons growth increase the largest as most fierce of the three dragons drogon was almost killed in the slave pit what do you think would have happened to it if it were a westeros battlefield instead do you think aegon ls dragon balerion the dread would have almost been killed in a fuckin slave pit not a chance in hell so please spare me youre dany would easily take westeros without ser barristan because she has three dragons bullshit her dragons are nowhere near the size of aegon and his sisters yet and especially not at this point in the tv seriesdanys not about to win westeros with a army of foreigners and to win westeros you need support from westeros and to do that you need men that have names that hold meaning throughout the seven kingdoms to help you negotiate you need men that know westeros like the back of their hand men that can actually form battle strategies based on their knowledge and understanding of each region and kingdom of westeros like ser barristan does so no as of right now theres no way in hell dany would take westeros without ser barristan edited by jon icefyre 16 april 2013  0135 pm"

"Jon Icefyre",2013-04-16,"youre agreeing with barristan for being shocked at dany but you dont think the dragons are essential lol danys dragons will continue to grow she could wait a few years and invade westeros when they were huge but either way she does not need barristan selmydrogon was not almost killed in the slave pit he was surrounded but he could have flown away at any time he was there to take daenerys awayaegon the conqueror won support from westeros with his dragons dany can do the samethere are other people in westeros who know about westeros so again barristan is not necessaryyes drogon was almost killed in the slave pit and even though drogon did indeed leave with dany the dragons intial reason for being there wasnt to take her away it was to hunt because drogon smelled blood and death from the fighting in the pits it wasnt even aware of danys presence initially it wasnt until after dany ran into the pit and made herself known toattepmted to tame drogon that they then left togetherany way at this point in the tv series her dragons are essential because they prove that she is indeed danearys targaryen instead of some pretender and because of the potenial power they represent once they are fully grown there not even near that size yet so yes if it came down to having to kill them they would not be seen nearly as fearsome of a foe as aegon and his sisters dragons were aegon is not comparable to dany because his dragons were all a lot larger than danys are at any point in any of the books or seasons so far do you think if aegon l used the exact same method he used when he conquerred westeros but instead his dragons were the size that danys dragons currently were he would have still won no fuckin way so this whole if aegon can take westeros with just dragons then dany can do the same idea is complete utter nonsense because her dragons are not nearly as powerful of a weapon as aegon and his sisters were yet if dany wants to wait until her dragons grow that big and then attack westeros then yes she wouldnt need ser barristan but as of right now in the tv series when she bitches him out and threatens to part ways with him theres no way in hell shed do shit in westeros without ser barristans help because her dragons are still at the size where they wouldnt be the biggest factor in the outcome of a large westeros battle so she would still need to take the throne the way robert baratheon took it tywin lannister would put her and her dragons heads on spikes most ppl in essos dont give a fuck about dany they just want her dragons and if she didnt have ser jorah or ser barristan with her protecingadvising her she would have already been dead a long time ago edited by jon icefyre 16 april 2013  0327 pm"

"boojam",2013-04-16,"one point id differ on this is that barristan currently is the only personal link dany has to westeros that would allow dany to convince folks back in westeros that she is legit jorah is seen as shamed and a slaver some houses may automatically bend the knee to house targaryen again once dany arrives but there are likely a fair number for whom barristans word and approval would be a meaningful endorsement not only is he still respected by much of the kingdom as one of the greatest knights and kgs to have lived but he served house baratheon loyally so he has the unique perspective only a few have of having been in both the usurpers and targs campseta this may be the key difference in dany being perceived as a foreign invader with dragons who happens to be a targ vs someone people can get behindwell one might think there would be a lot of westerosi who know dany is legit if knifes were sent to kill her and her brother for many years then those who sent them would know then there is the assertion in the books that there is a silent minority majority who would welcome back a targi have the crazy notion that varys knows who dany is and where she is and she important to some mysterious story we know nothing abouttho i always thought it odd the seven kingdoms were unified by conquest and force but apparently there were good targ rulers so maybe people yearn for that the big fly in the ointment is this whateverthehell the winterohters wantgrrm keeps intimating they are going to come on stage in a big way  while we readers and viewers fiddlefaddle around about the fight for the iron thronemy impression is fans are only interested in events in westeros with a fair following for things in the eastmy hunch is that winds of winter means what it implies and its gonna be west and east and maybe that goofy red god vs the sauron of the northwe shall see"

"ohpooratlas",2013-04-16,"i did not see anything barristan said as being out of character at alli dont care how well trained he was at keeping his mouth shut around aerys and i think that might have had something to do with the fact that aerys was utterly insane  dany has given life to three dragons and the world has not seen dragons for over a century his reaction to her giving up one of her dragons so casually seems perfectly normal giving the context of the situationthe only person i thought acted completely and totally out of character was stanis and thats not even just from the books"

"Starklefire.",2013-04-17,"i think overall this episode was one of the best in the tv show and i actually think that this is probably the closest the show has ever gotten to the books in terms of plot development edmure and brynden are setup well i think you have no idea how excited i was to see riverrun on the credits too ive heard people complaining that brynden is too mean and edmure is too inadequate but for times sake it was done well and i really enjoyed the funeral scene i think edmure will be lightened as a character either by him doing something that doesnt cause problems or by cat ensuring robb that edmure has a kind heart i was also very impressed at how accurate they were with edmures failure to just hold riverrun they explained what hed done wrong in less than 4 minutes and it made sense the mountain would still be a high value target and killing him would increase morale so i can understand why robb would be furious especially since he lost 208 fighting men to hold a stone mill another nice touch was introducing the lannister hostages so methinky theyre going to be keeping karstarks betrayal the pod scene whilst uneccessary for the major plot points does provide a lighthearted feel to the episode to juxtapose the dramatic side of things which seemed to be a major theme for the episode here and i actually think it helped attach to the character more since bronn tyrion and pod are all going to be heavily featured in kings landing and it helped establish a buddy feel to their relationship also props for the mereenese knot joke i enjoyed daenerys scene quite a bit especially the rhaegar fought valiently rhaegar fought nobly and rhaegar died line changing the plaza of punishment to the walk of punishment doesnt bother me in the slightest and i think they captured the negotiation fairly well if a bit too quickly but they kept the same tone from the books especially danys anger at barristan and jorah questioning them and i like the hint that she understood the bastardised valyrian kraznys was speaking i have to say though im not impressed with the casting choice for missandei she just doesnt feel right to me her acting seems a bit flat ah the glorious theon scenes ive seen a lot of complaints about these but im happy that theyre going in this direction rather than removing alfie for two years and dropping him back in again i think itll be interesting to see how the mind games between ramsay and theon play out since we already know that ramsay pretended to be friendly and build up a kind of stockholme syndrome relationship with theon making him believe that whatever ramsay did to theon he did because theon had made him do it by misbehaving so i think theyre doing that well the actor hasnt had a chance to come into his own yet and i definitely think that he can play a sadist like ramsay but he doesnt look too menacing and maybe how they first introduced him as a broomsweep might end up reducing the impact of this character being sinister loved the forshadowing though you little bastard jons scene so far im liking them as slow as theyre going im still not seeing ciaran hinds as being my mance rayder though he looks like hes had a stroke hes far too blunt and his jaw looks too square cut im loving tormund though and i think sending him to the wall with jon will be a good time to build up their bonding relationship well know when he makes a joke about his manhood and says har that they did a good job i also like what theyre doing with the white walkers adding the artist element to make them seem more alien to us the small council chamber made me laugh out loud just the facial expressions of cersei varys and tyrion made it worth it it kinda shows that tywins kids are reduced to just that kids in his presence aryas scenes might be some of my favourite in the series thoros does a brilliant job and has a sort of jack sparrow feel to him and the goodbye between arya and hotpie was done well and made me laugh a fair bit especially gendrys yesit is i also love anguys banter with the hound as for locke and his merry men who are brilliant singers it would seem i think i might prefer those to the bloody mummers vargo was a pretty uneccessary character and we already know that the story is going to the same place locke will take jaime sans hand to roose at harrenhal where qyburn will take care of his wound and roose will meet with jaime and that whole business will go down setting the scene for the rw it was a nice touch to keep the sapphires line in and i think that locke has more reasoning than vargo to cut jaimes hand off since its perfectly reasonable for him to believe jaime is going to be beheaded so it makes no difference that he has 1 hand or 2 it was just a way to show jaime that he wasnt fucking around nicolaj did a brilliant job with that scene too especially the scream at first the realization then the pain kicking in and of course that ending i didnt like the song it wasnt done very well if you ask me but again i did like the sudden change in tone between jaimes loss and the upbeat bear and the maiden fair so far my only concern is stannis storyline im a stannis fan and imagine my surprise to see him grovelling on the beach to melisandre about how he needs some lovin i also didnt like him bringing up renly like he did at this point in the story hes meant to be grieving for renly not getting angry with him stannis isnt needy like that its such a shame too i love steven dillanes portrayal of stannis and this is more a writing issue than anything else overall brilliant episode"

"Jon Icefyre",2013-04-19,"i just dont think ros will end up being the fake stark she seems to be too old and ppl forget shes secretely most likely not even working for littlefinger anymore and is instead a spy for varys based on the scene they had at the end of season 2 varys makes it clear to her that he doesnt force his employees into situations that could bring them serious physical absue the way littlefinger does so if she his indeed now secretely working for varys i cant really see varys being okay with her marrying ramsay rape torture and flay you alive bolton"

"JMJ",2013-04-19,"one thing about replacing jeyne with someone random as the fake arya  we dont know how that whole storyline will play out do jeynes ties to winterfell play some role during twow in the preview stannis pov from twow we see that spoiler mors umber confirms jeyne as arya because jeyne knows some details about winterfell and farya will be sent to the wall with nestoris and justin massey other threads have speculated whether or not she will head with them to braavos using a random person may or may not fit into that storyline"

"Zombie",2013-04-19,"i mean in the books it was clear it doesnt matter what fake arya looks like it just needed to be a northerner that knows about winterfell since everyone is dead they can use it as a way of just showing that bolton and ramsay know shes fake while sorta making tortured theon more important again too heck they even had that scene with ros breaking down in front of littlefinger like she would do again with theon there is also history between ros and theon from back in season 1  i think it would make her wedding to ramsay that more intriguing and show that theon is so scared of ramsay that hes willing to not really help ros out immediately in the tyrion chapter i reread it was said that littlefinger found arya and gave to tywin though tywin knows shes a fake and at the moment in the show ros is the only one who makes sense there but i suppose it could be someone new it just seems highly likely to me that they just might implement that role on her but i guess we shall see in time im willing to put a golden dragon on it im right though biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd "

"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2013-04-16,"all of jaimes prowess is sort of hinted at through some dialogue in the show i would have liked if they make him seem the prodigy he was in the books as well but oh well spoiler i think they will have a good opportunity to display it showing him getting significantly better at fighting with his left while practicing with ilyn payne or whoever the hell they get to replace him in the show"

"Currawong",2013-04-17,"yeah ok that makes sense to me know before i thought that they were bolton men but thought it would but roose in a bad situationyes its only an issue in the sense that the writers need to address it in the way that they write the return to harrenhal and the roose  jaime scenes there assuming they are following the book and will have that dinner where the two of them are playing verbal diplomatic games but its in no way a showstopper or insurmountable and its not going to lead to huge plot inconsistencies its the sort of thing that would naturally flow out of story adjustments once they made the decision to change vargo hoat to locke so im really not worriedall they need is a few episodes to fill that up after that all they need is a goldcolored nonmoving glove yes a rigid golden glove would probably be the way to go in the books he doesnt wear it all the time but it would make life a lot easier for ncw as well as the producers if they just gave him the glove well jaime did have ironic thoughts of being goldenhand the just biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd  edited by currawong 17 april 2013  0318 am"

"Jaqen Hghar",2014-02-18,"this is a late comment  but thats what you get for some national networks being late putting out season 3   i have to admit i thought they were going to disable jaime in some different way than in the books a bit like patrick swayze in north and south who was if i remember correctly severely limp in the tv series while he lacked an arm in the book sure a missing hand is easier to fix on screen than an entire arm but it will still take some effort so i was actually wondering whether they were simply going to break his leg or an arm to disable him or do something else but i guess the missing hand is crucial enough for the story and jaimes character development that the producers are prepared to make the effort edited by jaqen hghar 18 february 2014  0837 am"

"RememberTheNorth",2013-04-15,"that end credits song redefined th word flop i was expecting a cool rendition similar to the ending of blackwater but instead what we got was a crappy version that ruined an otherwise semiepic ending of an episode everyone that i watched it with even said the song was ridiculous and thought it was a joke and i was inclined to agree on top of that the last version was so shitty that some people did not even recognize it was the same song being song toward the middle of the ep which is shameful in my opinion honestly i would second what others have said on here that the first version sung was miles better locke or whoever was singing had a great voice despite being a potential rapist"

"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-04-16,"my guess is that the vast majority of nonmessage board people did not know that was a different version of the song that appeared earlier to most it just sounded like some random punk song the explanation given by the writers we couldnt ask a composer to write a piece of music that would fit suggest its own solution  maybe complete silence with no music over the credits was the better idea the example given of jarring juxtaposition that inspired them came at the end of a movie when youre leaving an audience with the final emotion for the story youve just told there is no need for continuity moving forward this scene wasnt a final scene and will be built on in successive weeks silence to contemplate the import of what youve just scene and consider it moving forward seems a much better choice to me after all what it means for jaime to lose his hand is incredibly interesting moving forward but instead of leaving you to ponder that youre completely jerked out of the scene and left thinking about the music rather than the loss of the hand weird choice"

"Dove",2013-04-17,"sassycersei might be my favorite tv character ever yallit was a perfect scene it encapsulates the attitudes and standing of everyone involved in the same way that a mess of dialogue would and it was absolutely hilarious at the same timeif you hated this bit i think you might just hate fun period"
"Sun",2013-04-17,"great scene beautifully conceived and shot the highlight of the episode really the way cersie positioned her chair it wasnt facing the council members at the opposite side of the table as one would expect her chair was turned slightly to the side looking towards the far end of the table where the final empty seat was located where she expected tyrion to sit even in a council chamber and in her fathers presence or perhaps because of it cersie is most wary of tyrion so suspicious of him is she that she feels the need to seat herself in away that would insure she has an eye on him at all times"

"Ser Pounce FTW",2013-04-17,"i loved this scene it was a great showing of the power struggle within the small council i also noticed cersei was bored while most of the business at hand was being discussed setting her up for how she will handle things after tywin dies she only perks up when tywin gives tyrion his new job which both she and tyrion think is an insult yet it seems to be affording tyrion a chance to gain very important experience it seems like a slight just as being put in charge of the sewers at casterly rock seemed and yet tyrion is learning the crucial management of labor and resourcesi see what youre doing martin"

"PatrickStormborn",2013-04-17,"great scene absolutely the last thing i thought people would complain about in this episodeim one of the ones complaining about it and i feel that i should clarify my position the bottom line is that pivotal scenes are being cut from the show due to time constraints in favour of two minutes of moving chairs around its a great scene but its also a slap in the face to fans of characters whose storylines have been cut and reducedbut honestly i just wish the entire scene hadve been longer far too much time was devoted to the chairs considering the amount of dialogue we got i would be complaining less if we hadve got an additional few minutes of material out of the scene  particularly as its going to be the last time those six characters are ever going to be in that position together again when thats taken into account im sure most fans would agree that the scene was a bit of a wasted opportunity"

"Xcorpyo001",2013-04-15,"we know from the book that ramsay became the heir of roose bolton only after domeric bolton the rightful heir to the dreadfort suffered an unfortunate accident most likely by ramsays hands as roose himself tells theon at a later time could the producers insert that in the tv show to better portray ramsays true character until this episode i believed everything in the dreadfort dungeon with theons torturers was just a ploy and everybody knew that the guy torturing theon was not ramsay and they played along in his escape so that ramsay could have one of his little hunts now i believe his position is a normal one for a bastard raised at his lord fathers court jon was a exception for many reasons and even him had some problems with cat i believe ramsay released theon not for his own entertainment but to set a trap for his brother once hell trick theon in revealing all that happened at winterfell hell just take theon back to the dreadfort accuse theon for the death of domeric and his guards and force roose to declare him his next heir especially after getting the information from theon proving his worth as his fathers right hand this will really change the scene with roose and reektheon having their first face to face"

"Xcorpyo001",2013-04-15,"ramsay couldnt just pick a random dreadford goon to play along at impersonating him while hes just a simple guy in the background so killing off one his trusted men just for conning theon is a little farfetched what was the plan then how was he going to free theon without bloodshed i dont see ramsay convincing 5 of his men especially someone from his close innercircle to just die so he could fool theon into trusting him yes i could see ramsay kill some of his own soldiers just for the lols of it but not one of his trusted supporters and that guy seemed pretty surprised to find himself with an arrow in his shoulder not to mention the fact that he missed a vital organ on that guy while he directly killed all the rest he probably wanted to make it a personal kill upclose and personal he wanted to show his brother who was the one that killed him and why and domerics last words were bastard all his men know better than do that even with an arrow in him it will really add to ramsays deviousness if it proves to be true"

"Mercenary",2013-04-15,"its probably just me but the ramsay character as depicted so far is almost exactly the way i picturedtheon what mostly set off this train of thought is the display of archery when he rescues theon from the guards that caught up to him in the book theon is described as a superlative archer the smirk as he shoots the last guard that calls him a little bastard and his hair is another big one incidentally isnt he the actor from misfits that uk show"

"Mulled Wino",2013-04-15,"i dont really think ramsey is all that concerned with any war effort or shortages of manpowersoldiers he seems entirely consumed with entertaining himself at the expense of othersthe only reason he can do what he does is because he has loyal dreadfort men to help him they wouldnt stay loyal for long especially because they report to roose so the cat would be out the bag"
"Catherine Storm",2013-04-15,"im pulling my hair out with this story line i loved the reektheon chapters and annoys me that i dont know whats going on with the show"
"White Harbors Wrath",2013-04-15,"the only reason he can do what he does is because he has loyal dreadfort men to help him they wouldnt stay loyal for long especially because they report to roose so the cat would be out the bagwhy would the dreadfort men ever find out the true story of what happened its not like theon is a trustworthy source of information even if he spilled as far as anyone knows 5 guys got lost in the woods and ramsey brought the prize back"
"Cas Stark",2013-04-15,"why would the dreadfort men ever find out the true story of what happened its not like theon is a trustworthy source of information even if he spilled as far as anyone knows 5 guys got lost in the woods and ramsey brought the prize backhow would the dreadfort men think theon escapted in the first place got loose got a horse got out of the castleall on his own not believable why would any of the dreadfort men help theon escape they wouldnt not believable so the story the show has constructed appears to be illogical if you think about for more than 10 seconds"
"cybobbie",2013-04-15,"if domeric were alive roose wouldnt have sent his bastard to take winterfell from theoni second that roose mentions that ramsey is in charge so domeric is already dead so no need to mention that domeric was far from a torturer"
"freetickles",2013-04-15,"how would the dreadfort men think theon escapted in the first place got loose got a horse got out of the castleall on his own not believable why would any of the dreadfort men help theon escape they wouldnt not believable so the story the show has constructed appears to be illogical if you think about for more than 10 secondsthe guys who chased after theon obviously didnt question that he had simply escaped when ramsay shows up with theon and says theon managed to kill the other dudes before ramsay could catch up with them i dont know whos going to question him"
"White Harbors Wrath",2013-04-15,"thats the problem too much thinking about something and finely dissecting something that probably is a moot point for the characters overall arc 7 days between shows is too much time to contemplate minutia ramsey is evilhe killed some guys that probably were sent for theon by himself the last soldier shocked sees the person who gave the chase order is the also the guy killing him and calls him bastard as a wink wink to readers it really doesnt need to be more complicated than that"
"Cas Stark",2013-04-15,"the guys who chased after theon obviously didnt question that he had simply escaped when ramsay shows up with theon and says theon managed to kill the other dudes before ramsay could catch up with them i dont know whos going to question himyes but it does not make sense like i said if you think about it he couldnt possibly escape himself get out of the castle with a horse unless someone helped him we know that nobody at the dreadfort is going to cross the boltons like that and that there is no benefit to doing so for someone to do it the chances that theon would escape all the way back to pyke in order to reward whomever helped him escape would be slim to none which any dreadfort person would know so the whole thing is illogical from top to bottom if the premise is that the dreadfort men really thought theon escaped and ramsey killed his own guys and then is going to blame it on theon weak from torture but was able to shoot 5 men down it would have made a lot more sense and been logically consistent if the entire hunt was staged and ramsey just then took him back to captivity instead of killing his own guys"
"White Harbors Wrath",2013-04-15,"the show doesnt have the luxury of chapter upon chapter of inuendos and ramsey heresay to prove what an ahole ramsey is so they may have to offend book reader logic to prove a faster point in an already rushed adaptation i agree there are holesbut theres been bigger one in the ramseytheonhornblower saga than just 5 guys going missing the other couple hundred people at the dreadfort will probably not miss themtheres a war going onim pretty sure theyre not the first people to go missing without explanation"
"Cas Stark",2013-04-15,"its very sloppy plot construction that only holds up if you dont think about it and could easily have been done in the context of the show without the mile wide plot holes of ramsey killing 5 of his own men which presumes they are not a part of his hunts and that apparently the dreadfort is run so loosely that the heir to the iron islands can escape all on his own because no one at the dreadfort was in on letting him escape"
"morky",2013-04-15,"your theory is pretty cool but theres just no way it domeric i also dont see any continuity errors here i find it completely believable that ramsay does this this is all for fun he didnt tell the guards he was going to let theon go he just did it and probably chirped them for letting him escape and told them to go after him see it wasnt just a hunt for theon it was a hunt for all the bolton men ramsay dont give a fuck about these guys he came up to them and ordered them to torture theon while he pretended to be a janitor what were they going to say no  lord ramsay he would have tortured them if they said no people dont mess with ramsay because hes batshit insane and is the heir to the dreadfort this guy yells bastard before he dies because hes probably been thinking for a while that ramsay would kill him for no reason which in fact ramsay does gotta say i am loving this storyline such a great introduction to one of the best villians of all time i literally jumped up when the dieing torture says oh you little bastard ahha"
"tito5601",2013-04-15,"the guy who was killed last by boy is lord torturer no"
"Kasrith",2013-04-15,"we know from the book that ramsay became the heir of roose bolton only after domeric bolton the rightful heir to the dreadfort suffered an unfortunate accident most likely by ramsays hands as roose himself tells theon at a later timecould the producers insert that in the tv show to better portray ramsays true characteruntil this episode i believed everything in the dreadfort dungeon with theons torturers was just a ploy and everybody knew that the guy torturing theon was not ramsay and they played along in his escape so that ramsay could have one of his little huntsnow i believe his position is a normal one for a bastard raised at his lord fathers court jon was a exception for many reasons and even him had some problems with cati believe ramsay released theon not for his own entertainment but to set a trap for his brother once hell trick theon in revealing all that happened at winterfell hell just take theon back to the dreadfort accuse theon for the death of domeric and his guards and force roose to declare him his next heir especially after getting the information from theon proving his worth as his fathers right handthis will really change the scene with roose and reektheon having their first face to facethis doesnt work because roose wouldnt have told robb that he would send his bastard to winterfell if he had a true born living son at the time"
"Aeternum",2013-10-03,"the character who tortured theon and wanted to fuck him into the dirt is credited as skinner on imdb  i dont think he has a name or anything hes just an unidentified torturer at the dreadfort although he seemed to be the leader of the guys who were torturing theon and he definitely took part in operation winterfell because he was wearing dagmers robes  so definitely not domeric bolton iirc there was an interview with iwan rheon where he talked about ramsays backstory in the tv show and his fratricide was one of the things rheon mentioned so yeah domeric is also dead in hbocanon edited by aeternum 03 october 2013  0135 am"
"LordStoneheart",2013-04-15,"my sister a nonreader just told me she loved how much more ruthless robb seems since season 1 she thinks its quite attractive and really routes for him im actually dreading the look on her face when yeah so ive also seen it said that he is becoming an unsympathetic character and his story arc this season wont be appreciated by time the season ends i completely disagree this episode with edmure really impressed me with how richard has portrayed robb and certain aspects of how the writers have written him with the exception of i dont want to marry the frey girl i dont think hes too out of character from the books robb in the show is now seeming more kingly in my view does anyone else agree"
"lostinwesteros",2013-04-15,"it seems to me theres been lots of robb time last season and this but little to no time with him waging war i dunno its hard for me to remember at this point that hes part of the fight to win the war we just havent seen it maybe thats too harsh but    just my gut feeling"
"crazibouncer",2013-04-15,"im lovin robb laughing at his grandfathers funeral was not cool though"
"Montey14",2013-04-15,"well he has to act like a king nowand edmure completely blew up his strategyhence he has to make up for it by marrying roslin freyand well we know the rest"

"teemo",2013-04-15,"weve only seen one battle the entire seriesits kind of weird"
"juanml82",2013-04-15,"well tvrobb knows hes loosing the war and is starting to get desperate the actor conveys that well i didnt like his interactions with edmure and they certainly dont look mature they are well interpreted what i mean is that i dont like the characters action laughing at the lord paramount of the riverlands and his highest ranking officer at his grandfathers funeral is definitely not something a king should do ranting at edmure when he robb failed to communicate his full plans and without a reason as in the books its poor leadership furthermore he undermines edmures authority over the blackfish edmure and not the bf is the lord of the riverlands i dont know if i hadnt read the books i might begin to root for the south this season edited by juanml82 15 april 2013  0935 pm"
"lannistergold",2013-04-15,"i like tvrobb he couldnt relish the thought of arresting his mom and its a very sad thing to see happen but her actions more or less amounted to treason so what could he do as in the books he made a huge strategic blunder in only giving partial instructions to edmure and seeks to shift blame  not exactly praiseworthy but i cant imagine theres much leeway for an absolute monarch to admit that he was wrong"
"The Ghost of Winter",2013-04-15,"my boyfriend said hed quit the show if robb dies mwahaha"
"shiola",2013-04-15,"well my nonreader friend still likes him so thats good one of my reader friends despises him and wants to see him die im in the middle its his relationship with cat that i love the most especially in rewatching s1e10 if we get more scenes like that or him yelling at edmure because at least that was him doing something related to the war more people will come back around to him before the rw whether i like him more or not i care more about tv robb than i ever did about book robb"
"Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl",2013-04-15,"i never saw it as a blunder of him not spelling every detail out to edmure he said hold riverrun and edmure knew what he wanted but wanted glory for himself on tv and in the books clearly robbs snicker wasnt out of amusement but out of frustrations with edmure i can see him thinking that you have the nerve to disobey my orders and go after the mountain because you want to be the lord of riverrun and have a song sang in your name other than the ballad of the floppy fish yet you cannot even shoot an arrow straight enough to light the funeral pyre"
"Janicia",2013-04-15,"robb had no relationship with his grandfather snickering at anybodys funeral isnt kingly but that funeral wasnt ever going to be particularly emotional to robb"
"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2013-04-15,"robb had no relationship with his grandfather snickering at anybodys funeral isnt kingly but that funeral wasnt ever going to be particularly emotional to robbstill though hes ned starks son i know hes young but that was very odd for his character to chuckle when his mother is standing right there mourning the loss of her father not to mention hes their king and giggling is not a very regal thing to do at a funeral"
"Silverx2",2013-04-15,"it was less of a snicker and more of a are you serious regarding edmure not having full knowledge robb has just made his first trip to riverrun in the show and as such all of his discussions with edmure have been via raven to tell edmure the entire plan would have been stupid if someone intercepts the raven the plan is ruined robb told him to hold riverrun and edmure decided to ride out and meet the mountain against the explicit stay at riverrun order robb i think really nailed his dressing down of edmure do you think tywin lanister is going to sow for peace because i have his brothers grandsons it was brilliant as he had to stop and think just how far removed are these two kids from tywin the line about the troops was also brilliant robb is being shown to be an intelligent general while making mistakes any young king might make without the guidance of a father figure tywin looks more brilliant in the show due to upcoming events because of it the north could have still won the war if not for the judas actions"
"victim",2013-04-15,"it was less of a snicker and more of a are you seriousi got that too i saw it as an awkward exhale more than an actual snicker anyway i feel i lost a lot of confidence in robbs characterisation after season 2 seeing as pretty much all of his screentime was devoted to his relationship with talisa richard madden stated in the comiccon panel that he prefers playing action over romance and i think you can see that in his performance hes an extremely interesting character when hes talking about strategy with his commanders and mother but the romance scenes as few as they were just dragged im assuming well see less of the latter this year seeing as the relationship with his queen has already developed enough"
"Lord Godric",2013-04-15,"so ive also seen it said that he is becoming an unsympathetic character and his story arc this season wont be appreciated by time the season ends i completely disagree this episode with edmure really impressed me with how richard has portrayed robb and certain aspects of how the writers have written him with the exception of i dont want to marry the frey girl i dont think hes too out of character from the books robb in the show is now seeming more kingly in my viewdoes anyone else agreei absolutely agree with you i think the absolute best acting weve seen from richard was his scene with edmure and im really looking forward to his future scenes this season especially with rickard karstark"
"The Fourth Head",2013-04-16,"marrying the paragon of virtue miss talisa nightingale after she ribbed him for being the cause of so much death makes him imo more sympathetic i agree with lord godric maddens scene with edmure was fantastic those narrowing angry eyes to punctuate the point wow"

"Juan_Snow",2013-04-16,"im lovin robb laughing at his grandfathers funeral was not cool thoughive seen a lot of people on the boards upset by robb snickering at edmund during the funeral i didnt really think it was that big of a deal if you put it all in perspective hoster tully was an old man that survived multiple campaigns and died of natural causes in his own bed if youre a lord and live into your fourties in a land as martial as westeros youve done pretty well imo hes probably been to more funerals than he can count since the war started so laughing at his uncles poor aim didnt seem that out of place"
"Sun",2013-04-16,"i love book robb and i love richard madden  though i do think he needs to find a different way of expressing authority and anger than scrunching his face i hate what they did to robb on the show check any of last seasons robb threads for the reasons why my nonreaders arent especially attached to robb theyve decided last season that hes marked for death this season they are betting on when"
"-Ghost-",2013-04-16,"yeah i also thought it was more along the are you serious lines towards being frustrated with edmure i didnt think he was laughing"
"The Mighty Conch",2013-04-16,"i am not sure why people are getting on his case so much because snickered at edmures failure he wasnt disrespecting his grandfather he was disrespecting edmure i think he has been acting like a king and i can feel a bit off more than he can chew vibe coming from him which is well suited"

"Rapsie",2013-04-16,"the reaction to robb is the same from folk i know who just feel he is a meh character ironically the rw may not seem like a big deal to most people in the books it was a shock in the tv series it is obvious from a mile off that hes doomed"

"Tadco26",2013-04-16,"tv robb almost makes me a frey sympathizer he expects others to keep their vows and obey but he doesnt keep his own he is older than book robb and should be wiser but acts more foolish he seems to have zero regard for how his actions negatively impact his situation where younger book robb at least realized what a problem it created basicly he decided to marry who ever he wanted on a whim becaue he felt like it and everyone else be damned even though he had the council of his mother against it before hand he knew his bannermen didnt like talisa he had no social obligations to marry her and didnt have the emotional toll of his brothers deaths setting up the situation book robbs decision may have ultimately been equally foolish but it was a very ned like decision doing something to protect someone he loved in jeyne regardless of the consequences to himself much like ned confessing to treason before being beheaded conversely marrying talisa because he feels like it against the council of everyone else comes across as a very selfish decision"

"teemo",2013-04-15,"cant believe this hasnt been started what did you think it seems to be one of the least popular topics of discussion but these are two pretty major characters being introduced i really like clive russell and think hes an amazing blackfish and i actually like the casting of edmure despite a lot of peoples negative reaction hes physically what i always pictured basically im not a huge fan of everyone treating edmure like total crap but i guess theyre trying to show that hes sort of a nitwit prerw and with how little screen time everyone getsits an easy way to do it opinions"
"shiola",2013-04-15,"i will have to rewatch it to gain a full opinion my initial reactions were that i liked them both quite a bit blackfishs scene with cat was touching and i liked edmure with robb i disliked blackfish pushing edmure out of the way at the funeralrobb snickering at edmure at the funeral but honestly i dont think those wouldve bothered me so much if they hadnt been highlighted by the boardsdiscussion with other fans it was meant to show just how pathetic they all think edmure is thats what i took from it i understand where people say edmure is too arrogant rather than naive but it doesnt bother me yet"
"Young Nan",2013-04-15,"i dont like how the blackfish treated edmure in the book he shot the arrow out of tact to spare edmure further embarrassment his dad just died and hes the new lord of riverrun in wartime but blackfish was all pissy with him in the books one of blackfishs qualities is that he was pretty understanding and they did it differently in the show i know edmure is kind of slow on the uptake but they really seemed like they wanted to hammer it home and make him look like a blathering idiot so the audience would get it"
"Newstar",2013-04-15,"clive russell as blackfish is flawless loved his scene with cat tv edmure seems to be not only a dolt but also a bit of an arrogant dolt but i like tobias menzies portrayal so far i kind of wish we had more ginger tullys though"

"lostinwesteros",2013-04-15,"i thought both castings were great as well of course both of the scenes showing edmure up were in the books just not happening right next to each other when i read the book the part about hoster tullys funeral byre what i remember is that it just kept getting further and further down the river so that it was almost out of reach before the blackfish saved the day edited by not only but also 15 april 2013  0637 pm"
"Dove",2013-04-15,"tobias menzies has made quite the career out of portraying selfinvolved dolts hasnt hei thought the treatment of edmure by the blackfish was kind of weird he came across as a petulant nagging jackass more than anything robb laughing at him during his fathers funeral and then chiding him for succeeding in a plan that he didnt even discuss the possible outcomes with came across badly tooedmure the theon of the tullys kick him while hes down hahablackfish came across much better in his scene with cat genuinely sweet and touching"
"Young Nan",2013-04-15,"also want to add that robb and bf praised edmure for his victory in the books and then waited to ream him for his screwup until they were behind closed doors publicly laughing at and shoving the lord of riverrun in public would not be appropriate in the books gotta dumb everything down for the show i guess"

"Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl",2013-04-15,"i loved the blackfish in all of his scenes i dont have a problem with him shoving edmure because i always found him to be an arrogant dolt seeking glory and failing miserably at it his heart was in the right place as far as the small folk was concerned but overall he is not the sharpest tool in the shed and he has a major inferiority complex"
"Theda Baratheon",2013-04-15,"i didnt mind the gruffness of the blackfish you seem to be forgetting hes lost his brother too its understandable he might be upset even if hes more understanding in the books what i hated was fucking robb snickering why why did they put that in"

"Darth Pipes",2013-04-15,"i definitely wish we had gotten the blackfish earlier and edmure too i hated the way blackfish treated edmure at hosters funeral that was not blackfish tully he was sympathic to his nephew and told him that his own father had failed deliver the arrow too hell rip you if he thinks you deserve it you can argue either way if edmure deserved it for the stone mill battle but he wouldnt have shoved aside the lord of riverrun at his fathers funeral it reminded me of characterassassinating scene they did with ron snape and hermione in one of the harry potter films that being said once blackfish got his scene with cat his true character really shined through thats bryden tully im curious to see what theyll do with him on the show edited by darth pipes 15 april 2013  0822 pm"
"Montey14",2013-04-15,"edmure was a bit of a dolt in the books as wellits just that they treated him with a little more respect being that hes the lord of riverrun and allbut the scene when they scolded him was pretty much right from the booki dont think they over done that scene"

"shiola",2013-04-15,"do they just want us to hate robb so we arent so upset come episode 9 thats the feeling ive gotten with him from like episode 8 of season two until now i thought the rw was supposed to be devastating i was devastated by it and it really hurt me maybe they just dont want people to ragequit the show i dunno their handling of robb is so strange"
"JMJ",2013-04-16,"the change in edmure and blackfishs interactions and personalities on the show will have some effect  not sure how big  on how edmure is seen by show viewers with respect to the rw in the books he seems mostly clueless his arrogance and snippiness in the show might raise suspicions about his complicity in the rw"
"ShigellaSand",2013-04-16,"the shove was absurd if they didnt want to waste time on an exchange about hoster missing too they couldve just made it a hand on the shoulder a shared look and then the blackfish gently taking the bow also edmure shouldve had a moment with cat andor their uncle in that scene where they remember hoster after all the two of them hadnt seen hoster for years while edmure still lived with him catelyn shouldve been reminiscing with her little brother about their childhood"
"Rapsie",2013-04-16,"the talisa mistake has meant that in order to make him not a complete douche that threw half his army away they have had to play down the involvement of the freys and play up edmure and cat as being the cause of his mistakeits really a shame because edmure and cat as characters are suffering and its not because of the acting because the acting is really good"
"Underzaker",2013-04-16,"pwell i guess  by making him more of a dolt  they want us to show edmures growth when he helps blackfish escape  hence  liking him more something like sam edited by underzaker 16 april 2013  0116 pm"

"I'll pay the iron price",2013-04-16,"how many fighting men do house tully have the riverlands have been ravished the tullys have a bad ass battle commander in the blackfish yet seem to be looking a bit silly is this down to edmures bad leadership perhaps this is why blackfish disrespects him so"
"WinterisAlwaysComing",2013-04-16,"i loved the opening scene didnt mind robb hiding a snicker maybe im in the minority to me it felt like robb knew he wasnt supposed to laugh but after two bad misses he couldnt help it he wasnt blatanly guffawing or anything i think the show could use a touch of humor take out tyrion jaime and the new appearances by the queen of thorns and its all frowning crying weeping and glowering and thats just catelyn edited by winterisalwayscoming 16 april 2013  0446 pm"
"Klye Condon",2013-04-16,"i felt like the blackfish and edmure were brilliant in their respective roles but the edmure is stupid stuff was a bit heavy handed and unnecessaryone thing that irked me is whe the blackfish called edmure on not referring to robb as his kingwhen did the riverlords ever pledge ther allegiance to the north in the tv seriesin the books sure they pledged their allegiance at riverrunbut in the tv show this is the first time we have even seen riverrun the northern lords and bracken pledged after some randomn battle but i dont know why everyone just assumes that robb is now the head honcho at riverrunthe riverlords have been off fighting the lannisters on a separate front for 2 seasons and we have heard practically nothing about them until a mallister turned up dead at harrenhal last week so its not like they are a massive component in robbs army"

"shiola",2013-04-16,"its just a debate about semantics really and those are kind of tiring most think he was laughing some of us think it was less severe it doesnt matter a whole lot at this point at the end of the day it was inappropriate for robb to react out loud in any case the degree to which we find it offensivestupiduncalled for can vary"
"ShigellaSand",2013-04-17,"its a laugh it is however a frustrated headshaking huffed out laugh rather than a snickered teehee either way hes publicly disrespecting his uncle and bannerman at whats quite possibly his first official act as the brand new lord of the riverlands his mother is also standing right next to him and she shouldnt have to put up with seeing her brother treated like that at their fathers funeral"
"Lord Flashheart",2013-04-17,"i think this laugh is being blown out of proportion have you ever been to a funeral i have been to many and sometimes you laugh it isnt that unusual death doesnt have to be one big dark thing i think the laugh is from robbs frustration with edmure for throwing back the mountain against his order and edmure being unable to hit the shot just made robb smirk thinking you douchebag no big deal"

"The Mondrian Oak",2013-04-17,"as i wrote in another thread i think that what many are forgetting as far as edmure and brynden are concerned is that the show has only threefour minutes to establish their main carachter features they had to establish the blackfish as a strong leader who is also a caring uncle and edmure as an incompetent yet honest and loyal man how to do that first fine edmure had to miss the first three arrow shots and when he does we all see that every missed shot wounds him inside a little bit more than the previous then the blackfish shoves him and edmure does not manage to hide his being humiliated and takes care of the matter thus showing his authority and ability yes he didnt shove edmure in the book but at that point of asos we all knew who they were and what they were capable of doing in the show we dont then the second scene at first edmure comes out as arrogant and brynden following his previous actions shows his leadership and competence in warpolitical matters then robb gets angry with edmure as the latter understands his mistakes and says maybe the most sincere sorry on the show and we dont see many people apologizing in got therefore yes he may be arrogant and incompetent sometimes but he is basically naive and most importantly loyal and last the scene with cat manages to show how caring comforting yet strong the blackfish is so the two have been pefectly portrayed their most important and complex features clearly defined in just three minutes if this is not outstanding character development then i dont know what is"

"Dove",2013-04-15,"no thapphireth youre dead to me dd really though lockes fine its not like vargo hoat was a particularly deep and compelling character hes menacing and has a sick fuck sense of humor just like hoat theres not much more to it the saga of harrenhallthe brave companions was interesting in the books but its waaayy too convoluted to really bring to the screen it makes sense that theyd turn them into bolton men"

"Capt Banjo",2013-04-15,"there is no evidence that the rw is being planned at this point in the story why would roose who peels people like bananas care about the kingslayer loosing a hand if he hasnt dealt with tywin yet even if he has dealt with tywin he forgot to tell locke about it or just said bring him back alive itll be more interesting if they show roose make the rw deal with tywin not knowing jamie is unhanded then show the aftermath of the mixup when roosetywin finds out i like locke too bad he is a dead man walking"

"Jamie Lannister",2013-04-15,"it kinda put me off to see him kill his own men that seems like a waste and have you seen next episode promo it seems hes taking him to moat cailin no or deepwood motte which would be strange since it is on the other side of westeros and all without revealing himself interesting to see how they going to resolve thiseh i thought it seemed pretty par for the course for ramsay he had no compunction about killing innocent people under his rule see the farmer whose head he threw at theon in dance so treating a few of his goons as fodder for his game doesnt seem too farfetched"
"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2013-04-15,"it takes a real psychopath to kill his own loyal men for some sick game hes playing i guess thats the point"
"Brother Without Banners",2013-04-15,"ive liked the changes to the theon story so far i thought killing his own men was a perfect touch yes hes handsomer than i thought he should be but it does sort of add to the creepiness if hes not a repulsive torturer on outside but a psychopath on the inside im curious to see where theyre going next week though it sounds like deepwood since they mention yara being there its too soon for moat cailin imo but it did look like the sort of ragged fortress moat cailin is supposed to be"
"Chuck88",2013-04-15,"i didnt notice it at first but when he slowly walks into focus just before killing the last of his men the music sounds like something lifted straight out a horror movie not to mention the way the camera zooms out and we see theon hobble after him looking very much like his reek already even the look in his eyes when he takes off theons constraints in the earlier scene this is one twisted dude and i think its going to blow minds of readers and nonreaders alike when we see the full extent of his evil"
"margotsunshine",2013-04-15,"i agree so much that the ramseytheon storyline is brilliant so far especially considering that theon doesnt really appear in the third and fourth books i think ramsey killing his men is also a great way of building up his character especially for the big reveal ramsey is ruthless and an awful human being so its really no surprise that hes a monster even though nonbook readers think hes this great savior for theon thisll build up so much also for theons loyalty to ramsey further along the line also i love iwan rheon for the role hes a wonderful actor and if youve seen any of his work on misfits hes fantasticeven has a very sadistic side in the first series yeah hes cute but he plays psycho very well"
"lostinwesteros",2013-04-15,"i absolutely loved it i dont know maybe i was caught off guard but i never thought spoiler the bastard would be kind of cute right on point there was something bugging me about him from the very beginning and its also that hes not only cute but looks and acts so innocenti didnt notice it at first but when he slowly walks into focus just before killing the last of his men the music sounds like something lifted straight out a horror movienot to mention the way the camera zooms out and we see theon hobble after him looking very much like his reek alreadywell i watched the durn thing three times last night and never noticed the music ill have to go back tonight to find it what a good touch that would be i can not believe how the nonbook readers will be shocked when they find out what ramsay is really like i already had a non book reader friend comment last week after seeing theon gallop away on the white horse in the preview for this week that she was really really glad to see that theon was getting away"

"Penguin king",2013-04-15,"im quite happy with the way this storyline is going they missed out on reek last year so they needed a way for ramsy to earn theons trust and be in theons service so that we can get the full impact of the reversal later on itd be nice if ramsy had been a bit more reeklike and a bit less of a pretty boy but i like iwan rheon as an actor so i guess the trade off is worth it"

"Dove",2013-04-15,"i loved that moment the line is great foreshadowing and the expression on ramsays face combined with the brutal finality of the mans pointblank execution is enough to give you pause but you cant really bring yourself to care considering he was a torturor and attempted rapist theyre throwing off just enough hints that something is off for perceptive watchers to pick up on it even though you really want to believe that theons finally found himself a benefactoritd be nice if ramsy had been a bit more reeklike and a bit less of a pretty boy but i like iwan rheon as an actor so i guess the trade off is worth itits hilariously hypocritical but something tells me ramsay would have less immediate fans if inshow he looked less like iwan rheon and more like the books description drunkgif classbbcemoticon altdrunk httpawoiafwestersmrsnowiijpg"
"sarah.jenice",2013-04-15,"i loved hearing the line because it seemed like a nod to book fans to confirm that this is ramsay the moment this young guy was randomly sweeping a prisoners cell in the dungeon of the dreadfort i knew he was ramsay would the boltons really let some random guy sweep the dungeon of course not i like that even as a book reader i have no idea where they are going with this storyline it gives us something really exciting to look forward to perhaps ramsay gets theon far enough to see yara in a castle and think he is truly saved before he reveals himself and drags theon back to the dreadfort ramsay likes his victims to think they are free before he destroys every bit of hope they have also giving ramsay and theon time together before theon knows ramsays true identity is important because a lot of the things ramsay used to torture theon were based on things he learned about theons personality while he was reek ramsay hated his pride among other things and those are the parts of theon he worked so hard to obliterate to make theon into reek he has to know what to destroy in theon to truly break him"
"Iotun",2013-04-15,"i think what strikes me so far in the theon storyline is that uneasy feeling that were leaving through somebodys nightmare does anybody else get that kind of unsettling vibe theons in a strange castle tortured by complete strangers for reasonshe cant understandhunted through the woods right when hes expecting rescue and saved by a slightly creepy pretty boy with no background it feels slightly surreal and demented"

"RememberTheNorth",2013-04-15,"i would like to say that what theyre doing with this character is absolutely brilliant i know full well from having read the books what ramsay is like but the producerswriters are brilliant in that from watching this episode one gets the sense that ramsay might just have another side or might actually be helping theon or so some people would think however i think this stays true to the ramsay from the books because just like theon in the books viewers will have themselves vexingly questioning ramsays place in theons story whether he will again help theon even as he fatally tortures him and plays cat and mouse in repulsive ways similar in aspect to the thought process theon likely went through time after time in the books writers are showing us early on that theon does not know what to think of ramsay and a few words from this sick individual are enough to console him to the point that reek becomes fatally attached to this character for survival because ramsay disgustingly has him believe he needs him for survival"

"HouseLark",2013-04-15,"nice line im firmly in the camp that believes they had to show the becoming reek storyline this season it wouldnt have just been a case of bringing back theon later it would be bringing back a ruin of a man and asking the audience to take it on trust that some bad shit happenedi cant place it in the books off the top of my head but i always thought of ramsay as handsome hes certainly not described as grotesque or even unattractive and martin is always sure to remark on any unattractive features of a character he should ideally be chilling and that doesnt require him to be unattractive"

"Dove",2013-04-15,"the ugliness isnt important to his character at all but to be fair he is pretty much constantly described as one ugly sob and not just in the context of an unreliable narrator ramsay probably had the most detailed physical description of anyone in the books for some reason honestlyeven if iwan rheon doesnt fit the actual description he is a fantastic actor and hes going to be great him being adorable makes it really easy for people to miss the point of his character but once they start playing up his monstrousness that should help he is definitely a weirdly handsome dudeedit i mean going by description alone alfie allen doesnt look like book theon but i dont think anyone could do a better job and hes redefined the character in my mind edited by huntington 15 april 2013  0453 pm"

"Clariana",2013-04-15,"the thing about ramsey is not that hes a torturere or a flyer but a player a toyer a seducer a perverter someone who loves getting under peoples skins not only physically but psychologically and delights in turning them against themselves and demolishing them as personalities what the series is doing here fits in very well with this and this iwan guy he has peter lorres eyes ideal"
"Foune",2013-04-15,"i think they made ramsay just too damn handsome i hate that im gonna start hating that guy very soon i always pictured him as lean with long dark damped unwashed hair and a cruel face but i understand that they cant use a such a look since theyre building him up to be a nice guy til he ends an episode in a cliffhanger where he reveals his monstrosity and the other thing i didnt like was he killed 4 men in seconds thats something a warrior like blackfish could do but i always thought ramsay was pathethic when it came to combat but i have understanding that it fits the character in the tv series"

"Kaitscralt",2013-04-19,"i dont think he was going to kill his men originally im assuming they were missing their arrows on purpose for ramsays sake unless he didnt care about his reek plans enough to tell them not to kill theon for me i think his men got carried away and when the possibility of theon being raped came up ramsay abandoned the plan and killed his men instead"

"PhoenixFlame",2013-04-19,"i wouldnt call it heroic but i saw it reminiscent of that passage in adwd where guards let theon wander most places at winterfell because hes ramsays pet maybe ramsay was planning on killing them all along maybe he just got pissy they were getting creative with his orders i dunno it will be interesting to see theon and ramsays interactions between now and when the adwd plotline begins"

"BorhPT",2013-04-19,"im very intrigued with this boy im pretty sure hes ramsay and the scenes of this episode were really tricky with a lot of doublemeaningsi just have some doubts on where this is going what is ramsay planning where were they and how did he tricked those men to his planmy scenario hes ramsay and those were his men they planned to torture theon for fun dressed as ironborn then ramsay dressed as janitor sets him free they do the acting perfect so hes fully convinced he gets his hopes high and escapes to the east now the most difficult part to understand ramsay tells his man hes not going maybe because he wants them to have fun and he has other things to do or maybe hes ill that day or maybe it is for when theon returns he can show his real face and his real captives and how it was just a funny joke for them at least eheh im not really sure here this is the only thing it occurs to me and if this is wrong maybe the whole scenario falls to the groundafter some hours the torturers go after him and ramsay stays at the castle but ramsay is a hunter and this time hes hunting for a higher goal  not hunting to kill some random people but to find a new pet since the other reek has died  for that he needs to put some thought into it and he needs to destroy theons outside but most important his inside so he lets the torturers go ahead of him and arrives at the right moment to save theon from his own man betraying them but he actually doesnt care about those pawnswhen the main torturer sees him his facial expression is very important he sighs glances down and shakes his head almost like saying f i knew it as they know ramsays a sick person and him not huntinghaving fun with them was to strange for a person like him ramsay makes sure the torturer sees his face and understands what is happening he calls him bastard and ramsay kills him with no remorse an usual thing to himafter that theon gets really frightened of him ramsay calls him lord and the scene ends with theon limping behind him like a poor follower that needs the janitor to survive this makes theon feel like he his yet powerfull keeping his old self and playing ramsays game for a little longer as he slowly turns him into reekalso in the first scenei loved when theon said i will make you lord of the iron islands for this and the boy answers we are not in the iron islands first thing theon reacts like what then were are we as he clearly thought he was by the fact that the soldiers were dressed as ironborn and the last thing he remembers his them attackingbetraying him in season 2 also the boyramsay doesnt say where they are so that way theon feels truly lost and realizes he needs to fully trust himalso on that scene we see a bit of old theon making promises to the low folks on how hes going to give them riches and titles because hes very powerfull and the boyramsay just tells him we are not in the iron islands like you have no power here making him even more afraid and helpless edited by borhpt 19 april 2013  0601 pm"

"Winterz",2013-04-19,"the book readers saw ramsays arrival to wf and cheered for he had saved the day from the evil and ruthless ironborn so it was shocking for them to perceive such twist when bolton betrays both stark men and then ironborn equally as there was no such scene in the show i think their approach by making him cute and the saviour and then the big twist this sounds a lot like in the book i wonder if his men knew of the entirety of his plan though unlikely they seemed quite surprised when the arrows came flying damn ramsay is a pretty good archer with fast and wellaimed shots it really does sound like one of ramsays little games edited by winterz 19 april 2013  0805 pm"

"Rebekah",2013-04-15,"i think im one of the few people who wasnt irritated by the podrick brothel scene and its led me to consider something about the way we as fans process this show we have a habit of going over layers and layers of meaning in martins texts of analyzing sometimes on a wordbyword basis this works because martin is so careful to not only write his story but to craft his presentation as meticulously as possible weve developed a high degree of trust in martin because of this  we take note of not only what is said but howwe as a fan base dont have that kind of faith in dd and tonight i think its caused a lot of the fans to miss the pointif you look at pods scene in the brothel and the follow up gossiping as simple comic relief it comes off as superfluous and silly more in the vein of a frat house comedy than game of thrones but i dont think thats what dd were doing at all like martin i think they used this to establish some very important things about where two characters are at now and where they will be at laterfirst tyrion were told over and over again that a lannister always pays his debts more often than not this is used as a threat or a goad to manipulate tyrion used it as a double entende with mord in s1 when it is used as a promise help me and i will reward you that usually means money titles or land tonight i think tyrion made good on his debt to pod and not with sex with confidancei dont believe for a second that three high class call girls refused their fee because a young untried boy was a talented or wellendowed lover even if he was phenominal in bed those girls would have to accept the coin they could never explain to their bosses ros and petyr baelish why they hadnt in fact they would probably face severe consequences if they did besides if you are hired to perform a service you dont forgo your fee because you had a good time while doing your job you count your blessings that your job was entertaining in stead of tedious or distasteful but you still except the feeforserviceinstead what i took away from this was that tyrion had paid the marker in advance probably directly to ros who runs the establishment he put gold on the table and let pod think that was payment in a way it was grand theatre and pod fell right in the girls gave him back the money and told him what a good time they had with him so much so that they wouldnt allow him to pay hes confused and flattered but also a bit startledpod is a shy nervous boy he performs his duties not only admirably but thoroughly and oftentimes beyond the call but his shy stutter and awkward social skills have overshadowed his quality service up until now now hes led to belive he has a talent that is appreciated for its own sake he returns tyrions money and is immediately put in the position of explaining to two highly sexually experienced men what he did that impressed theses whores so much that they couldnt bear to accept his coinwhat tyrion has given him in this is much more valuable than gold or sex hes given pod the means to feel confidant to believe that he has innate talents and skills that are worthy of praise hes found a way to try to make pod start to see his own valueright about now a lot of you are probably thinking so what who cares about the confidence of tyrions squire do we need so much screentime on this we should have more time for insert branaryadanyetc etcbut i think we do need to take the time for thisit probably wont happen until next season but pod doesnt just disappear when tyrion leaves kl he goes off and tries to help brienne in hops that by finding sansa he will be able to find tyrion this shows a great deal of loyalty a great deal in the books we learn something about pods backstory that gives us a sense of why he might be so loyal but the screen hasnt been able to clearly do thatthis gift of confidence creates a bond between tyrion and pod tyrion could have tried to reward pod with a knighthood gold land the usual suspects instead he took an interest in pod as a person almost as a little brother figure now when he turns up following brienne the audience will have something to look back on and realize that pod was more to tyrion than a servant and tyrion was more to pod than an employerthis may be a minor point  after all we have limited screen time and a lot of people wont care why pod is so eager to find tyrion however brienne is going to spend a lot of next season traveling its very possible they will cut ser hyle from briennes storyline in the interest of money and time if so then pod will be her one stalwart companion on her hopeless quest to find sansa since shes willing to go to extremes to suceed i think understanding why pod would follow her into those extremes will be important to a lot of viewers this i believe is the intent of these scenes"

"cybobbie",2013-04-15,"really good post rebekah ive got the feeling while watching the episode that tyrion payed in advance as well because without this the scene would be pointless however i didnt think about the reasons that you gave and didnt go far as you did on pointing pods travel with brienne i hope the writers really go this way"
"lostinwesteros",2013-04-15,"excellent post and considering that its your first we have lots to look forward to as you become more active in the forum and welcome to the forum of course i really liked your analysis and totally agree with the subtleties you brought up that went right above my head when i watched the show three times last night when i read the books ill have to admit i didnt pay much attention to pod didnt pay much attention to lots of peoplethings actually because i was racing through so fast just wanting to see what happened next the scene later on a feast for crows spoiler where pod and brienne and i cant remember who else  see how badly im remembering the details are caught by the bwb and uncat sentences them to hanging  its when she sees pod hung i think that brienne shouts one word  that we still can only guess at ilm assuming that whatever she shouted out it was enough to keep pod and the other one from death by hanging in starting out on this forum later i discovered just how noticed and how valued and loved pod was id thought of him kind of fondly before that but not really appreciated him like i do now thank you for the thread"
"Gannicus",2013-04-15,"yes it was but why did they need to include a brothel scene to bring this forwardapparently you didnt read the op that carefullywasnt even really amusing imonot everyone is going to love it but everyone i was with seemed to get a kick out of it"
"Alice in Westeros",2013-04-15,"i really like this idea i love pod and i didnt mind him getting too much screen time so i really enjoyed this scene but it felt like i was missing something i really like your explanation tyrion paying in advance because the shows explanation felt a little ridiculous even though it was hilarious it also reminds me of what jaime did or pretended to do with tysha for tyrion and that would mean that tyrion is creating a kind of brotherly bond with pod so i really like the possible implications smilepng classbbcemoticon alt "
"Javi Marcos",2013-04-15,"i totally agree with the op"
"SerArthurHeath",2013-04-15,"i agree on reflection theres also teh fact that tyrion loves jaime because he believes jaime did basically teh same thing as this for him it is literally the biggest and most personal show of thanks and affection he can envisage"
"Sun",2013-04-15,"instead what i took away from this was that tyrion had paid the marker in advance probably directly to ros who runs the establishment he put gold on the table and let pod think that was payment in a way it was grand theatre and pod fell right in the girls gave him back the money and told him what a good time they had with him so much so that they wouldnt allow him to pay hes confused and flattered but also a bit startledit never occurred to me that it all could have been a pantomime of tyrions devising for pods benefit it also works on another level in that it mimics what tyrion thinks jaime did for him when he was once young inexperienced and insecurevery nice thought rebekah thank youi wonder if its occurred to the writers as well laughpng classbbcemoticon altlaugh  edited by sun 15 april 2013  0217 pm"
"Sir Tony of Hibbert",2013-04-15,"personally my interpretation would be that tyrion would never involve himself in such a deception with whores having been on the receiving end of something similar himself seemed to me that the gold given to pod might have been a bribe from littlefinger looking to get a spy close to tyrion especially with his earlier curiosity as to the identity of his whore pod being the honest sort he is decided to report it to tyrion my theory anyway ill be intrigued to see if it plays out i was worried the series was collapsing under the weight of all those characters in the first 2 episodes but this was a return to form"
"Clariana",2013-04-15,"yes this is what i thought the gift is selfconfidence with sexi seems to me tyrion also gets a lot of his selfconfidence from sex this is why shaes betrayal was so shattering for him yes in the books hes under no illusion that shes a harlot but i think he also deludes himself sometimes into thinking that maybe just maybe it might be something else and shaes everenthusiastic attitude in the books feeds into this selfdelusion shaes a good whore a good salespersonwhen tyrion discovers that tysha was actually true and shae was eventually false he goes to pieces"
"WiDMNDBAMMD",2013-04-16,"nice analysis it might even go deeper than that lf mentions that he owes a debt to tyrion right at the same time tyrion mentions he owes pod his life they couldve worked out the idea before hand of tyrion pretending to pay for the service then they give pods money back or lf couldve decided afterwards as a way to pay tyrion back a long time ago tyrion believes that jaime did the a similar thing for him with tysha tyrion mentions that he isnt nervous with tysha etc so i dont find this situation out of the ordinary for tyrion doing the same thing with pod tyrion sees pod as a shy boy just like he was and a way to get him out of his shell is to give him confidence"
"Mulled Wino",2013-04-16,"i had trouble believing book pod would be that loyal to tyrion i didnt think their bond was that great at all great post i hadnt even considered although i do think the scene was a bit long for that"
"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-04-16,"i really like the op and want to still disagree in that it could have been done with less nudity but the nudity did serve to emphasize pods inexperience and lack of confidence around women im not sure there is a way to have conveyed that without showing how truly awkward he felt as those women were displaying their wares and its a memorable scene because of that nudity which may make it easier for viewers to understand later why pod is so loyal to tyrion"
"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2013-04-16,"i thought it was quite obvious that tyrion had arranged it but apparently i was in the minority i just think the glances ros gives pod and the fact that tyrion so blatently puts the purse down for pod to see was done on purpose so that we know that 1 ros is buttering him up because she knows of the plan 2 pod needs to see the purse left by tyrion to fully register that he supposedly try to pay for it i doubt theyd waste several minutes on a pod is a rockstar in the sack joke still great op"
"Silverx2",2013-04-19,"completely agree with your assessment"
"King Tyrion I",2013-04-19,"i think im one of the few people who wasnt irritated by the podrick brothel scene and its led me to consider something about the way we as fans process this show we have a habit of going over layers and layers of meaning in martins texts of analyzing sometimes on a wordbyword basis this works because martin is so careful to not only write his story but to craft his presentation as meticulously as possible weve developed a high degree of trust in martin because of this  we take note of not only what is said but howwe as a fan base dont have that kind of faith in dd and tonight i think its caused a lot of the fans to miss the pointif you look at pods scene in the brothel and the follow up gossiping as simple comic relief it comes off as superfluous and silly more in the vein of a frat house comedy than game of thrones but i dont think thats what dd were doing at all like martin i think they used this to establish some very important things about where two characters are at now and where they will be at laterfirst tyrion were told over and over again that a lannister always pays his debts more often than not this is used as a threat or a goad to manipulate tyrion used it as a double entende with mord in s1 when it is used as a promise help me and i will reward you that usually means money titles or land tonight i think tyrion made good on his debt to pod and not with sex with confidancei dont believe for a second that three high class call girls refused their fee because a young untried boy was a talented or wellendowed lover even if he was phenominal in bed those girls would have to accept the coin they could never explain to their bosses ros and petyr baelish why they hadnt in fact they would probably face severe consequences if they did besides if you are hired to perform a service you dont forgo your fee because you had a good time while doing your job you count your blessings that your job was entertaining in stead of tedious or distasteful but you still except the feeforserviceinstead what i took away from this was that tyrion had paid the marker in advance probably directly to ros who runs the establishment he put gold on the table and let pod think that was payment in a way it was grand theatre and pod fell right in the girls gave him back the money and told him what a good time they had with him so much so that they wouldnt allow him to pay hes confused and flattered but also a bit startledpod is a shy nervous boy he performs his duties not only admirably but thoroughly and oftentimes beyond the call but his shy stutter and awkward social skills have overshadowed his quality service up until now now hes led to belive he has a talent that is appreciated for its own sake he returns tyrions money and is immediately put in the position of explaining to two highly sexually experienced men what he did that impressed theses whores so much that they couldnt bear to accept his coinwhat tyrion has given him in this is much more valuable than gold or sex hes given pod the means to feel confidant to believe that he has innate talents and skills that are worthy of praise hes found a way to try to make pod start to see his own valueright about now a lot of you are probably thinking so what who cares about the confidence of tyrions squire do we need so much screentime on this we should have more time for insert branaryadanyetc etcbut i think we do need to take the time for thisit probably wont happen until next season but pod doesnt just disappear when tyrion leaves kl he goes off and tries to help brienne in hops that by finding sansa he will be able to find tyrion this shows a great deal of loyalty a great deal in the books we learn something about pods backstory that gives us a sense of why he might be so loyal but the screen hasnt been able to clearly do thatthis gift of confidence creates a bond between tyrion and pod tyrion could have tried to reward pod with a knighthood gold land the usual suspects instead he took an interest in pod as a person almost as a little brother figure now when he turns up following brienne the audience will have something to look back on and realize that pod was more to tyrion than a servant and tyrion was more to pod than an employerthis may be a minor point  after all we have limited screen time and a lot of people wont care why pod is so eager to find tyrion however brienne is going to spend a lot of next season traveling its very possible they will cut ser hyle from briennes storyline in the interest of money and time if so then pod will be her one stalwart companion on her hopeless quest to find sansa since shes willing to go to extremes to suceed i think understanding why pod would follow her into those extremes will be important to a lot of viewers this i believe is the intent of these scenesgreat analysis well done thumbsupgif classbbcemoticon altthumbsup "

"Mother of Mini Dragons",2013-04-15,"the funnest part for me was my hubbys reaction to jaime losing his hand his mouth was hanging open and he kept sputtering his hand they just cut off his hand he said he thought maybe a finger is what it was leading up to but not his whole hand he is is entirely confused about theon and kept waiting for yaraasha to show up but i agree with pp up thread that this is intentional by the writers so the nonbook readers are in for a shock both my dad and hubby agree that theres no way dany is giving up her dragon and believe that some people are about to be cooked edited by mother of mini dragons 15 april 2013  1035 am"
"cybobbie",2013-04-15,"here the main discussion with my noreader family members was about jaime and despite the fact that their first reaction  a while after the shock  was that he deserved they started to think more about jaime and briennes relationship and discussions and started to see that maybe jaime is not as bad as the one that threw bran from the tower and even considered that cersey is really a bad influence in jaimes life it was kind of hard to talk with them and hold my tongue as for theon they are still have no idea about what will come and finally they both agreed that dany has a plan and she wont give up the dragon what was really cool"

"total1402",2013-04-18,"it looks like next episode will be when dany gets the unsullied and its episode 4 chronologiclly that is the end of asos part 1 which is the greater part of daenerys story in storm of swords considering she wasnt in episode 2 at all that means 3 episodes were deemed enough to cover asos part 1 i mean they try dont get me wrong on the walk of punishment they have jorah and barristan condence their feelings on the unsullied how rhaegar led versus he died nobly and we even get one of danys lines from acok about killing innocents being bad this felt very much like they were trying to make up for how slow her story was in acok when really they should have just considered condensing qaarth and astapor since the warlocks are the only relevent thing that happens in qaarth but asos part one is a very different beast to acok and a lot of very good bits of that novel were cut for instance   danyjorah  pretty amazed they removed that and all related scenes even their disagreement and fallout over the unsullied is really glossed over the one thing i am praying they dont do is have jorah do this later on once daario shows up because altering the context like that wouldnt be good discussion of the dragons  they havent been named yet and this is getting really annoying they had no issues with naming her child rhaego they shouldnt have issues over naming rhaegal the only dragon we ever see most of the time is drogon and we all know who hes named after i almost cringed when kraznez said he wanted the biggest since the audience have no way of knowing which one that is as we never see them all close up in acok they all looked the same size i also quite liked how in the books they talk about just how big the dragons can get talking about the usurpers dogs  this is something that barristan and dany talk about the show seems to have purposefully avoided her stating i hate starks and baratheons for too long its kind of important a lot of show viewers are just going with shes gonna kill those evil lannisters and would never hurt ta starks coz theyre nice like her unlike stannis who would be a lot more tolerant to show viewers if he was just saying he wanted joffery dead and didnt add robb stark onto that list so danys feeling of this need to be conveyed to the audience sooner rather than later i wish i could be more specific but you get my idea part 1 of asos in 3 episodes tbh given that we know from the last episode mysha that its going to end with the battle of yunkai and her taking the slaves there that means the rest of the series is going to be making a big deal out of what one maybe two of her chapters in asos of what was pretty much an opening skirmish the decisive battle of asos was of course mereen for daenerys yunkai is even made out as a skirmish they could alter that of course but i just dont see how theyre going to pad out the rest of the series since theyve already covered asos part 1 i guess theyll maybe inflate how dangerous the yunkai force is and emphasise dany becoming a war leader a lot more still i dislike how theyve handled this and it largely seems like a knee jerk reaction to danys arc in season 2 condensing all of asos part 1 into 3 episodes is a big deal i am not saying the episodes are bad by any measure but i feel they dont do justice to the novel by glossing over things just to get dany fighting as early as possible in the series"

"PatrickStormborn",2013-04-20,"its a very good decision to get to the dracarys moment as soon as possibly imo danys story becomes far more interesting when she takes the unsullied and becomes a queen with an army in episode 5 andor 6 i expect well get a scene or two of her travelling with the unsullied and marching towards yunkai and there is plenty of material for taking yunkai shell arrive in episode 7 and take it in episode 10"

"total1402",2013-04-20,"well yeah three episodes to cover part 1 of asos which is far more weightier than what dany does after in the next part if i remember right the single chapter which the series will be dealing with is about dany surveys the yunkish army with jorah has argument with jorah after seeing the ambassadors for the second sons stormcrows and yunkish and daarios secret visit which prompts it talks with barristan about rhaegar jorah returns having won battle with her plan and the betrayels dany has the myhsa scene at yunkai problem being that we are told straight away that dany will win this battle its just a question how many she might lose in the process and taking yunkai not exactly a high stakes event because the real conflict is at mereen unlike with the blackwater last season i havent seen any footage that indicates the battle itself being shown which you would normally expect so i am actually quite doubtful they will show this fight but it just isnt very important in asos more the warm up round so by the looks of it theyd be turning that one single chapter into the rest of dany for season 2 edited by total1402 20 april 2013  0730 am"

"SerArthurHeath",2013-04-15,"the pain wouldnt hit him until later the amount of pain involved in limb loss if unexpected would be buffered by endorphins adrenaline and other pain suppression routes or else the sufferer would lose consciousness which would be fatal in most situations in which one is likely to lose a limb the scream was at teh realisation that he had lost his hand not the pain it wasnt an in pain sounding scream it was a omg my life is ruined scream i thought it was quite realistic and the best bit about the handloss jaime didnt expect to have his hand cut off so the gap was realistic to my knowledge of pain theory and neuroscience which is not negligible"
"Bolivar",2013-04-15,"the realism things do kind of dampen the suspension of disbelief i was more perturbed by the acting and direction the small council chair scene went on just a little too long establishing that these were in fact actors in front of a camera doing what they were told and not believable characters in a story same with the fireside scene in crasters keep it looked like a large group of actors who were painfully obviously waiting for some kind of cue stannis whining for sex was equally painful to watch in the thread discussing this someone posted david and dan interviews about their thoughts on stannis and im really starting to become terrified that they have not in fact read the later books finally last weeks episode actually received a lot of praise for not showing a gratuitous pair of boobs yet in their directorial debut dd manage to throw away that good will with tyrion and bronn whimsically introducing a 15 year old to whores the following scene about how they didnt take his money was painfully forced and had none of the easiness or believability you expect to see in any buddy comedy dont get me wrong there are many things so right with the show but it really is being dragged down for me"

"Joyful Union",2013-04-17,"the tyrionbronnpod scene the 2 minute musical chairs and the two theon scenes were bigger problems for me if material is having to be cut from other storylines heres some advice stop wasting time by showing scenes that werent in the book and dont advance the ploti agree that the chair scene and the tyrionbronnpod scene didnt advance the plot but the theon scenes are fairly important to introduce ramsay and theons transformation into reek that seems fairly important for plot development and the storyline was in the books though the scenes have been changed"

"JonCon's Red Beard",2013-04-18,"this post is about some scenes in the show which i felt bummed about even if they are little thingsfirst one is the scene with jamie getting his hand cut off you can clearly see here that there is like half a second where jamie looks at is hand and then goes okay this is my cue to scream and does sothis cant really work in real life your hand gets cut that message goes straight to your brain you dont have to look at the damn thing also screaming is involuntary its a reaction you dont get to think about it it just happensi am really annoyed by this type of thing and it crops up all over the place in tv and movies a good example would be the scene in the last star wars film where general grievous elaborately flashes his lightsabers like two inches from obi wans nose and the actor doesnt bat an eyelid in reality one would have an instant reaction to step back jedi training or not i call bs of course in reality that thing is cgid in and the actor has no idea what hes looking at so thats whyi disagree here as many others1 there is a moment of shock when you dont react at the pain because youre exactly that in shock when the whole idea finally sinks in its that you just react it happens also consider adrenaline as a factor during fights in jaimes case i think he simply was in a what the f moment when he saw his hand cut and it took him a second to realise what actually had happened2 some people have lag i do many times ive touched hot stuff and it took me about two seconds to feel the pain and release whatever i was holding some other people is very resistant to pain"

"PatrickStormborn",2013-04-18,"agree with both of you so much ive been called this before despite the fact there are elements of the series i really enjoy i think im one of the few that likes shae in the show quite a bit from what i can tell actually my big things are talisa the depiction of nudtysex and both of you know my feelings about that and character alterations that are big enough that i feel its not the same as what i know from the books im at the point now where i no longer want to talk about catelyni agree with all of this i like show shae and i love the friendship between her and sansa although i fear the writers making shae turn on her like what happened with doreah and dany ugh but talisa the depiction of nuditysex and character alterations are all simply unforgivablethe writers included talisa a sassy nurse who chafed at her position within society and gives advice to robb but they rewrote catelyn a woman who chafed at her position within society and gave advice to the men around her so when i look at talisa in the show i see a female character who fits all the ingredients for being strong but without challenging men in any way if that makes sense a large number of readers hate catelyn probably because  as she notes herself  all i have done is speak the truth are men so fragile they cannot bear to hear ittalisa has some of cats basic traits that have pretty much been taken from cat herself but shes been watered down so that she doesnt make male viewers feel uncomfortable or challenge their views and perceptions in the first episode she told robb that he was being too harsh with catelyn shes your mother but she didnt really do anything could you imagine if that was bookcat and ned shed tell him the truth regardless of whether he would be able to handle ithow much of that thread did you read the writer expands on his position quite a bit and had me rethinking tywin he added some nuance to the character that i hadnt noticed beforei agree with this so much jaime was defined by his sword hand and cersei its what made the loss so powerful and pushed his story forward through the rest of the series i want to feel the same emotional impact i had with the booksagain  agreed the tywin point was really interesting and not something id ever thought aboutwell thank the seven youre not the one in charge of this adaptation then cheersgif classbbcemoticon altcheers  it would be one infodump after another it seemsif you equate plot advancement with infodump then maybe its good that the series includes such dreadful filler maybe viewers like you are dds intended target audience i hope you enjoy the show hopefully none of your favourite scenes will be cut so that dd can include nine minutes of filler throughout the episode 2 minutes of musical chairs and 7 minutes of tyrionim not going to pretend i could make the tv show better or write a good script etc but yeah i do think i or really anyone else could have found a better use for that seven minutes of screentime seven minutes is more than enough time to include two scenes we could have got another jon scene hes leaving mances camp next week so theres a lot of wasted opportunity there or an extra few lines in aryas scene to establish whats going on or a sansa scene showing her friendship with margaery etc none of those scenes would have been infodumps but they would have been interesting to watch and actually advance the plot"

"Theda Baratheon",2013-04-18,"oh god i hate talisa i really really do what a badly written uninteresting and annoying as hell cliche of a character"
"Currawong",2013-04-18,"i understand from a tv series perspective why they had to change the jeyne plotline because robb had to be much more on screen for tv than he was on page in the book where of course he is not a pov character having him simply head off to the crag and then arrive back with this woman out of the blue just would not have worked for tv audiences no matter how much explanation  exposition they put in for that reason they had to come up with something that made more sense onscreen and allowed audiences to get to know robb better and also the woman he ends up marrying so i dont object to the idea of getting rid of book jeyne and coming up with someone else for tv story purposes my objections to talisa are therefore not that she has replaced jeyne but that she is not a believable alternative for jeyne when even strong and wellarmed brienne was always wary of the possibility of rape the idea of a single pretty woman nurse surviving unraped in the middle of an army is extremely implausible because i dont for one moment believe that the ordinary men in robbs army are any more noble about the treatment of women than in any other westeros army the cliche of grieving patient falls in love with pretty nurse may work in many other stories but not in the context of robb and his army mind you i didnt like book jeyne or her plotline either  im afraid that when robb returned with her and his story about saving her honour was the moment i lost any sympathy for him tbh i was never especially invested in book robb as a character anyway and for me as a reader his marriage to jeyne just made me shrug and say well as a king or a wannabe king you ought to know better sorry grrm but if i was supposed to be somehow impressed with his stark sense of honour it didnt work for me edited by currawong 18 april 2013  0920 am"

"PatrickStormborn",2013-04-18,"to be fair they are also using theon to introduce ramsay who didnt get his intro from the books a review i read recently on this site by notyoursir i think made an excellent argument why was ramsay excluded if the show had the time and budget to include dagmer cleftjawfor that reason im left believing that they deliberately delayed ramsays appearance so that they had a reason to include theon this season"
"Pinkie Baelish",2013-04-18,"i do agree that hes been given too much screen time unnecessarily thoughlike tyrionugh his scene with shae in ep2 was so pointless but im guessing it has to do with dinklages contract that he features in every episode"
"Theda Baratheon",2013-04-18,"i agree that flashbacks are a problem and one way to deal with them is by showing the story in a linear chronology but i think it would have been so much more powerful having theon missing for a season and opening season 4 showing him a broken man much like in adwd wed see his fear of ramsay but not understand why until we see what ramsay does to him and suddenly we start to realise what must have been happening for an entire season and during this time a lot of the hate for theon would have cooled down anywayi dont know i just think theons story was incredibly powerful in adwd and i think stretching it for so long is really going to prove detrimentali certainly see where youre coming from smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  and i agree that there are certain characters that are severely lacking in screen time at the moment i think a few scattered theon scenes this series would have been good i hope they dont give him 5 minutes or so every episode though sadpng classbbcemoticon alt the same with tyrion hes given too much screen time when characters like jon arya sansa and brans story lines are definitely not being explored enough sadpng classbbcemoticon alt "

"Ran",2013-04-20,"pretty sure you can structure contracts in different ways including contracts with long breaks in appearance where theyre still paid and so onthat said i thought alfie was fantastic but one of the neat things grrm does with the story is that you dont actually necessarily need to have him on the show anymore spoiler theonasreek is a ruin so changed by his experience that hes hardly recognizable you could just as well cast someone else to continue to the part if allen was no longer available in fact you could even see the argument to do it anyways simply because another actor would hit home the changes to the character"
"Keeper-of-the-Old-Ways",2013-04-20,"i actually quite like benioff as a director in fact he showed a lot more creativity and nuance in his storytelling than most of the other directors have in the show for starters i admired his understanding of using the single take fluidly moving through multiple compositions conveying lots of information in a subtle and more dynamic manner this was done beautifully during the opening scene and the craneup on the fist was excellent really stunning and eerie his aesthetic choices at crasters keep really captured a sense of despair lots of grey overcast tones i also liked his reveal that gilly had birthed a boy i felt that he cut too frequently during cats monologue though i felt he should have lingered on her face for the duration of it and shown the blackfishs reaction afterwards in a more weight closeup"

"TyrionsFlagon",2013-04-19,"couple questions about what happened in this episode pertaining to theon i know what happens in the book but im never sure where weiss and benioff are taking things is the guy that helped theon escape the same guy ramsay that showed up at the end and shot the 3 dudes with the arrows who were the soldiers that chased theon dreadfort men that ramsay killed i thought that theyd be in on it or was the guy that helped theon escape actually one of ramsays men any sort of clarification on this would be wonderful thanks"
"Darkstar For King",2013-04-19,"yes it is the same guy there is speculation that theon was held captive in hornwood lands since ramsay would have forcibly married lady hornwood and thus receiving her lands by this time and in the show he says ride east your sisters waiting but yara  asha would be at deepwood motte on the west coast and if boy is ramsay there is no way he would send him to her so again if there are in hornwood lands the dreadfort lies east also nah you got it all wrong man everything ramsay had planned like a game his men knew he would set theon free he told them to pretend he was just a dungeon sweeper what they didnt know was that ramsay would kill them to gain theons trust even more"

"BorhPT",2013-04-20,"i think the only intention of ramsay sending him east was for theon to get lost and dont get too far because if he was near wf or the wolfswood i think he would recognized it and even escape properly since he knew the terrain he seems pretty lost on the episode and he has to stop giving time for the torturers to cacth him where ramsay will be taking him now i have no idea"
"I'll pay the iron price",2013-04-20,"even if they were still at winterfell the eastwest thing still holdsyes but surely theon would know winterfell like the back of his hand and would therefore know that deepwood motte was not east of winterfell"

"iheartseverus",2013-04-15,"i thought he said real gods not old godsi figure he does mean the white walkers but i dont think they are the old godsyoure correct i just rewatched and he said the real gods not the old gods the old gods are those associated with the weirwood trees whereas craster seems to be implying that the white walkers are the real gods"
"shiola",2013-04-15,"did he say old gods i missed that if so i dont think the writers would put that in though the old gods are cool they wouldnt kill baby boys but what craster meant was since he sacrifices to the otherswhite walkers he has nothing to fear from them thats why he never joined up with mance in season 2"
"WiDMNDBAMMD",2013-04-15,"i am referring to when the nw gets to his place again he refers to not being afraid of what is out there obviously he is referring to giving his sons to the old gods i know this has been discussed many times before but did anybody get any new insight on what exactly he is doing and what he meanscraster is serving his sons up to the white walkers at least that is what looks like takes the baby those are his gods thus he has no need to fear what is out there as long as he keeps giving them sacrifices"

"sarah.jenice",2013-04-17,"great catch on him saying real gods when i watched the episode i was thinking that craster was wrong because mormont is of the north and follows the old gods i think if he said real gods and meant the white walkers that is probably the closest admission craster gives to what he is doing the wives are the ones that confirm it in the book when they tell sam that the sons are coming"
"WiDMNDBAMMD",2013-04-18,"yeh i was going to comment saying he said the real gods but many already have what does this mean hmmin this episode he is talking about the cold winds and how he has nothing to fear hes made a deal with the white walkers to offer up his sons to them the white walkers are the gods that he serveslast season craster lives his baby in the woods a figure with blue eyes takes it jon tells mormont about it he tells jon craster serves crueler gods than us"
"Joyful Union",2013-04-18,"i think its obvious that he is worshipping the white walkers"
"The Fourth Head",2013-04-18,"i think when craster refers to real gods he is referring to rhllor vs the great other extreme situations call for extreme gods and by sacrificing to the white walkers he is sparing himself and the rest of his family from certain death he could have gone with mance to march south but for him it was too risky and he was quite content doing what he is currently doing mormont doesnt serve babies to the great other he worships weirwoods and the old gods who are nameless but who quite possibly had identities originally which have been forgotten the north has not faced certain annihilation for thousands of years so their gods are gentler they make up their own code of conduct because they dont remember who their gods are most of mormonts men serve the seven from the south the gentlest and least relevant of the gods it would seem certainly to craster the biggest area i am curious on is when winter comes i doubt very much that craster be alone in taking this course of action if the others sweep through the 7 kingdoms who will be able to resist the barbaric temptation of sacrificing one of your own to save the rest it mirrors with rhllor quite nicely and makes it not about good vs evil rhllor vs the great other but about chosen survival methods reflecting the extreme circumstances and the personalities of the people involved it takes a brave enlightened and principled man to conquer fear by honourable means and craster in my view is merely the forerunner of this crisis i cant imagine that locke dude or theons would be rapist having any qualms doing what craster does in order to survive edited by the fourth head 18 april 2013  0341 am"

"A Dance With Drogon",2013-04-18,"i disagree that mormont did not know who craster was giving the babies to even though there are a lot of gods in this world i dont think he believes that there are gods hes never heard of that like to munch on frozen baby meat im sure that would be known throughout the realm or at least in the form of childrens ghost stories"
"Tadco26",2013-04-18,"it seems most likely to me that mormont just thought craster was killing the babies as a sacrifice many real world religions have had human sacrifices without an actual god coming to literally take that sacrfice on a different note i am curious as to how craster would have ever come up with the idea or negotiated the peace in the first place since the others havent shown any desire or ability to communicate with humans so far in any other situation"

"polarbear",2013-04-20,"lets not give craster too much credit here the man is not a theological scholar like some young actors on the series like most of the wildings he worships  the old gods but he has decided that the white walkers are in fact the old gods other old gods worshipers like mormont think hes nuts its like those branch davidians all deciding that david koresh was jesus christ reborn they might have still considered themselves christians but nobody else did"
"Ghost of Harrenhal",2013-04-20,"im pretty sure mormont knows exactly what craster is doing when john tells him he saw what took the babies mormont says he serves crueler gods than you or i or something like that mormont knows this but he knows he has to rely on craster so he doesnt say anything"
"The Flaying Man",2013-04-15,"i should preface this post by saying that i think ciaran hinds is a magnificent actor and played the shows version of mance very well however it seems to me that this is the last well be seeing of the kingbeyondthewall for some time although i did read somewhere that ciaran hinds has a reaction shot to tormunds strike force returning sanssnow while i willingly succumbed to the portrayal of mance in the show after the first episode which judged on its merits was a very good scene i genuinely feel that for all the building up to mances character over the last two seasons the payoff is disappointing i and many others aceepted that he was sculpted into a gruff seasoned warrior and not the jovial bard were so familiar with from the books but with all these changes in mind we did not see much of him at all over seasons one and two we were led to believe that this almost legendary figure mance rayder had managed to unite the constantly antagonistic tribes of the lands beyond the wall in season 3 so far we saw that the rumours were indeed true butwheres the payoff mance has a short scene in which he accepts jon into his forces another scene which serves to establish warging as an ability and a third and final scene where he sends tormund and a splinter force to climb the wall and attack castle black from behind usually i am of the mind to accept the shows treatment of certain charactersaspectsplot pints as changed or condensed to more appropriately serve the television medium however i must admit i am disappointed with the shows treatment of such a colourful character which is surprising considering the buildup he received i cant help but think that all of this is a detriment to jons overall arc"

"Dove",2013-04-17,"victim hit the nail on the head really its too bad we didnt get more scenes with mance i think the reason hes falling flat for people is because hes gotten maybe four minutes of screentime same with all of the wildlings and jon i assume fleshing mance out is just going to come later with all of jons extra time with the raiding party this season for developing tormund ygritte and orell well probably see the fun wild spirit of the free folk then edited by huntington 17 april 2013  0132 am"

"dolphlundgren",2013-04-17,"i think the writers will have more material for mance in the future that isnt necessarily in the books i doubt they will have him die in the battle with stannis as that would be a pretty severe departure from the books"
"JMJ",2013-04-17,"it would actually be pretty funny if dd freaked out book fans by having one of the many cliffhangers end in the character actually dying icould see that for mance as much as any of them"
"Hodors Shlong",2013-04-17,"i dunno apart from him not being a bard at least not that we know of up until this point i dont think the character is done too poorlyi agree that the screen time is a little disappointing but i kind of felt the same let down in the books too while he got considerably more time in the books hes still only in a handful of scenes in the first half and then only in it at the end when jon goes to meet him and stannis attacks i dont think weve really had enough scenes from him in the show yet to write him off as being a bad adaptation or wildly out of character from the books"
"Head of The Ned",2013-04-17,"i do agree he has been underused thus far my guess is in episode 10 we will see the entire wildling host as they prepare to attack castle black which will happen in season 4"
"Raion Laion",2013-04-17,"the thing is if you have a big actor play a fanfavorite character there is just no way anything less than magnificence will be tolerated i hope they at least give us val i can do without the bard realness but boy having val obliviated would just break my savage heart"
"Kienn",2013-04-18,"book mance always seemed lame to me as well the only cool thing he ever does is beat jon in a swordfight and you dont even know its him when it happens maybe next book well see he did something cool in winterfell as well but till then hes still pretty lame"
"Holy Sock",2013-04-18,"its very possible that they are moving mances material to season 4 i mean if we have 8 episodes before the battle at the wall its possible that we could see some more mancejon interaction when jon goes to parley with the wildlings introduce val and such mance telling jon why he left the nights watch etc"
"WheelofIceandFire",2013-04-18,"im sure i remember hearing mance deliver the line when the long night comes north of the wall becomes the kingdom of the dead in one of the behind the scenes videos and i cant remember him saying that line in the first three episodes so unless its a deleted scene then he will probably have more scenes in future episodes just not with jon snow"

"oierem",2013-04-19,"in the books there are just 2 chapters with jon and mace the third one is the cave scene and the next one is climbing the wall i hope that  once mance is out of the picture we will be able to see some actual interaction between jon and ygritte orell and the rest and let jon be a main character not just a background guy behing mace"
"Boulderbum",2013-04-15,"didnt see another thread talking about this but the show seems to have deviated from the books in that jon will be climbing the wall with tormund instead of the magnar who obviously wasnt cast in sos this is jons time to get close with igrette we can assume that will still happen but how will tormund being around change things will jons escape from the wildlings change will bran still be involved will tormund be captured at the battle for castle black southern edition will it change igrettes fate doubtful at least we should get some of the conversation weve missed between tormund and jon members and such"

"Mammothsbane",2013-04-17,"it does kind of mix up the times however its possible that jon turns his cloak again and warns the wall and then the assault of tormunds crew and mances army is better timed they attack more in sync and thanks to immense plot armor the wall is able to hold off the twopronged attack or tormund escapes somehow and climbs the wall back to the other side and meets back up with mance"

"SpaA<U+009F>vogel",2013-04-17,"is it possible they can use the impending attack on the wall as the final cliffhanger two horns it would fit the pattern of having the big climax of the season in the penultimate episode followed by a finale that involves the meta plot"

"boojam",2013-04-18,"we have already seen  in the previews the wildling assault group south of the wall at least thats what it looks like to me even a scene of ygritte using a bow with jon behind her question is are they going to have the skirmish for castle black this season because it seems the big battle for the wall occurs next season will rose leslie only be in two seasons i could see d and d having her escape only to die in season four with the battle for the wall never know what d and d will do edited by boojam 18 april 2013  1205 am"
"Head of The Ned",2013-04-18,"i think after jon escapes the other members of the party will just climb back over the wall and there will only be one battle ygritte would still die and there being only one battle will save time and money for hbothis is the most likely scenario"
"I do not sew",2013-04-18,"yeah i dont see how they could have the battle for castle black unfortunately not unless they scaled it waaaay the eff down"
"KARMAgrinder",2013-04-18,"while i understand the restraints i really wanted to see this scene as accurately portrayed from the books as possible"
"boojam",2013-04-18,"i think after jon escapes the other members of the party will just climb back over the wall and there will only be one battle ygritte would still die and there being only one battle will save time and money for hboi have watched e3 once and wont be able to watch it again till this weekend seemed mances instructions to tormund are a little ambiguous to me  i cant remember him tell tormund to actually attack castle black maybe he didbut you have made a good guess even tho  in the book it is more of a skirmish than a battle tormund will know that jon has gotten away and now its going to be a lot harder to take castle blackeven tho its kind of smallish d and d have been reluctant to put a lot action sequence like that in a seasonthe previews have shown  what looks like big preparations for the attack on yunkai if they elaborate that then they might well feel the season four battle for the wall is enough now that battle is elaborated by george in the book and could be expensive  giants and mammoths you knowplus they have get stanis in there its a blackwater momentthat would probably mean the conquest of meereen will get shorted edited by boojam 18 april 2013  0736 am"
"victim",2013-04-18,"boojam mance told tormund to attack when he gives the signal  the biggest fire the north has ever seen  mentioning theyve got the wall to protect them but it only guards one side"
"SeventySeven",2013-04-18,"im dreading this storyline because compared to the books its a bit all over the placewill rose leslie only be in two seasonsi could see d and d having her escape only to die in season four with the battle for the wallnever know what d and d will doshe should be only in one season this one if you ask me i keep seeing people suggesting theyll combine her with val  or that shell die next season killed by stannis men but that would ruin jons arc completely ygritte dying when and in the way she does its a catalyst in what makes jon the jon he ends up being after everything happenedas or the battle at the wall its one of my favourite parts as well but to be totally honest im not overly impressed by how jons story has been adapted"
"Septon Meribald",2013-04-18,"of course theres no way of knowing exactly what the show writers have decided to do but given the current set up i can envision a scenario that id be pretty happy seeing jon and tormund climb the wall maybe some wildlings fall maybe they dont if they do an extra might be given a line that amounts to ive climbed the wall a dozen times making him a stand in for jarl south of the wall jon escapes the wildlings along the lines of the book orell dies somewhere along the way leaving tormund without knowledge of when to attack he decides to go for a night attack as soon as possible knowing the jon will warn the watch battle ensues ygritte is slain tormund is captured mance shows up north of the wall and the battle plays out about the same as the books afterwards jon convinces tormund to talk to the captured wildlings and lead them south of the wall under the supervision of the watch i dont see any reason they couldnt film the battle of castle black theyve scaled down the wildling force so it would amount to about 20 actors and extras trading blows and firing some arrows there would be no complex duels to choreograph no expensive pyrotechnics no large contingent of horse wranglers to support a cavalry scene and no cg or huge group of extras to arrange for crowd shots since the armies are small"

"Septon Meribald",2013-04-18,"as i recall the only indication of the delay between north and south was because it took so much time and effort to move the entire crowd of wildlings families giants etc that point seemed to have been emphasized pretty strongly i dont remember any other tactical or other reason this happenedwell the idea was for the attack from the south to be sudden and unexpected the watch was already looking north after the return from the great ranging and the weepers attack at the bridge of skulls which had drawn off the larger portion of castle blacks fighting men if it hadnt been for jons arrival and preparation for the attack from the thenns castle black would have fallen and the gate would have been opened for mance once he arrived as was planned mance had several back up plans so there would be no need to try to micromanage everything the wildlings are still very independent people even if they have banded together so mance allows them to make their own decisions if the thenns failed at castle black he still had the weeper who might succeed at shadow tower if not for that he could attack head on at castle black as he did if that failed he could send climbers to a dozen locations on the wall at once he out numbers the watch 50 to 1 before the massive loss of manpower by the watch at the fist and in the battle of castle black and the bridge of skulls if all that fails he has the horn of joruman simply put if it hadnt been for stannis he would have won no matter what"
"JMJ",2013-04-18,"thanks for the detailed answer thats true  forgot about how impressive the wildling numbers were it made it all the more stunning when it all just fell apart sofast at the wall for them when stannis forces surprise them"
"Honourable Ser",2013-04-19,"i can understand how he could be found to be a bit tedious but the joviality of tormund represents something that is severely missing in the show  and that is the joviality of the wildlings in general its supposed to be an education for jon and for us that despite the really grim conditions the terror that is chasing them and brutality of life that the wildlings are still happy in their freedomi get that argument but my personal belief is that living in a hard place like that to rise to the top you have to have that grim mentality that means you can rise above those that seek to rise as well"
"NurseNinja",2013-04-17,"at first i was like why is ramsey pretending to be a cleaner in the dungeon and when the killing of his men seemed wastful and then the sneaking into a greyjoy castle need episode seemed pointlessly riskyhe really is the dungeon cleaner at this point he wasnt killing his men he wasnt the one that rouse bolton sent he really is that lowley at this stage hes using theon to elevate his position"
"KayOfLaihr",2013-04-18,"i think he killed his fathers men because they were about to take theon and theon is his to play with"
"Conchobar",2013-04-18,"nah you got it all wrong man everything ramsay had planned like a game his men knew he would set theon free he told them to pretend he was just a dungeon sweeper what they didnt know was that ramsay would kill them to gain theons trust even more"

"MisunderstoodFrey",2013-04-18,"yes rouse bolton thought it was a great idea that he had some cleaning experience"
"The BlackBear",2013-04-18,"another suggestion is that the men who went after theon were rooses steadfast men by killing them ramsay strengthens his own position"
"Iotun",2013-04-18,"i think killing his own men is just to show later that hes a complete psycho"
"Rhasgul",2013-04-18,"maybe he wasnt the sweeper but was just coincidentally cleaning up a bit spring autumn cleaningin all honesty though he has already taken winterfell for house bolton earlier on so there is no doubt that his status is far above sweeping the dungeons im not sure if the men he killed were in on his plot to release theon but its a sick mindgame nonetheless"
"Jamie Lannister",2013-04-18,"are we sure the guys who chased down theon are the torturers i could see ramsay sacrificing them either way but still probably worth bearing in mind that ramsay is quite explicitly the head honcho of the dreadfort right now roose mentions multiple times that his bastard will be the one who leads the attack on winterfell and takes prince theons head leading an army and capturingexecuting royalty isnt really a job for a legit janitor"
"Mulled Wino",2013-04-18,"another suggestion is that the men who went after theon were rooses steadfast men by killing them ramsay strengthens his own positionim hoping they stay closer to the books than that"
"Conchobar",2013-04-18,"another suggestion is that the men who went after theon were rooses steadfast men by killing them ramsay strengthens his own positionnope because he was clearly pretending to just be a cleaner and they were clearly in on it they are his pawns and he put them down for his own silent amusement"
"Theda Baratheon",2013-04-18,"nah you got it all wrong man everything ramsay had planned like a game his men knew he would set theon free he told them to pretend he was just a dungeon sweeper what they didnt know was that ramsay would kill them to gain theons trust even moreyeah this is what i thought anyway"
"The BlackBear",2013-04-18,"nope because he was clearly pretending to just be a cleaner and they were clearly in on it they are his pawns and he put them down for his own silent amusementthey may well have played along with the game thinking it was funny but not realising ramsay would also use it as a opportunity to strengthen his position roose says in the books that the bastards boys are loyal to him but still play along with ramsay it might not be too significant a deviation for ramsay to have worked this out in the showim hoping they stay closer to the books than thatwhen have they ever done what we hope"
"King Tyrion I",2013-04-18,"nah you got it all wrong man everything ramsay had planned like a game his men knew he would set theon free he told them to pretend he was just a dungeon sweeper what they didnt know was that ramsay would kill them to gain theons trust even moreseconded my thoughts exactly"

"Conchobar",2013-04-18,"ramsay is a sociopath he is playing this scenario out almost like he is playing with dolls reek being his favourite it is almost like he is compensating for something missing in his own life a father figure for one lol he uses his power then to indulge his desires i see him almost as a child with dolls he wants reek alive because he is like his walking work of art he takes bits off him and adds to him changes his personality etc edited by cellio 18 april 2013  1026 am"
"WhiteGuts",2013-04-18,"in season 2 roose said to robb that hell send his bastard to winterfell from this we can grasp that ramsay already has the 2nd highest position in house bolton theons torturers knew who he was they were part of the plan"
"Eric Xayavong",2013-04-18,"hm perhaps he never kills his own men unless he can frame it on another for instance he must kill all four chasing theon to leave no witnesses in his own group he can blame the deaths on theon his men would understand that soldiers die now and then during dangerous activities but little do they know the bastard is playing around with their lives hed only bring 12 men to kill on smaller activities and go so far as to kill 4 men chasing his new favourite toy"
"I'll pay the iron price",2013-04-18,"ramsay is in charge but the men will no doubt report back to roose perhaps ramsay wanted these men out the way and at the sametime he used their deaths to gain theons trust ramsay is pure evil  the only westeros men in his league of evilness would be gregor clegane or euron greyjoy"
"Peasant Rebel Leader",2013-04-18,"yeah its possible that the kiled men where the eyes of roose in the dreadfort so ramsay wanted to dispose of them maybe one was even rooses trusted person to keep ramsay in check but i doubt this will get fleshed out its not really important to the plot at all i see the plot points that matter like this  ramsay lets theon get tortured bad cop in extremis  ramsay gets the trust by killing the torturers good cop so that he gets to know theons secret are bran and rickon dead  ramsay imprisons theon once again and goes off to search for them  ramsay returns angrily and tortures theon even more put here the theon eats a mouse rawscene could be next season as well"
"Sidonie",2013-04-18,"you know i was wondering if ramsay was holding these bolton men responsible for the death of the original reek in some way so because of this he sets them up in a situation where he has an excuse to kill them all while pulling a masterful mindfuck on theon its a winwin for ramsay"
"Revae",2013-04-18,"its all a game for ramsay it was his own men thats why the guy called him a little bastard when he realised a that he had been setup to be killed  b  ramsay hates being called a bastard in the books he lets the girls run away before sending his dogs after them and states that he prefers to chase them for the thrill before he rapes and kills them god damn sociopath this is what hes doing to theon edited by revae 18 april 2013  0551 pm"
"Bolton's Bastard",2013-04-18,"you know i was wondering if ramsay was holding these bolton men responsible for the death of the original reek in some waywhat makes you say that just curious because i dont think a reek has ever even been mentioned in the context of the show nor has the notion that boy obviously ramsay is angry for the loss of a certain childhood companion"
"Sidonie",2013-04-18,"no the first reek hasnt been mentioned in the show at least not yet but the first reek is in the books and i was wondering if the boyramsay would later reveal to theon that he lost his reek to those men and now he was going to make theon his new reek"
"Bolton's Bastard",2013-04-18,"i highly doubt that even though i wish not necessarily the idea of dreadfort men killing reek but the relationship nonetheless i think our best chances of the reek dynamic went out the window when dagmer gave theon all his nasty s2 ideas edited by boltons bastard 18 april 2013  0803 pm"

"fede989",2013-04-18,"the thing that i found weird on episode 2 is that ramsay only approaches theon when all of his tortures are gone still undercover while theon has a bag on his head and cant see what is around him why would he do it if it<U+0080><U+0099>s all just an act and all of this men are his accomplices not even one of them has a look at ramsay when theyre leaving it seems too complicated if all of this is only meant to break theon spirit i think there is more about this than ramsay just being a psycho maybe some weird political angle edited by fede989 18 april 2013  0923 pm"

"BananaSpice",2013-04-18,"yeah i also considered how it was odd that iwan still acted meek  quiet when the men left while theon couldnt even see him  but its definitely just to fool the viewer if we need to come up with a real reason that makes sense w the story we can just assume he was getting into  staying in character i mean he probably told the men not to even look at him in case they give away the game"

"Set_Gecko",2013-04-15,"in the book though davos spirits edric away and since hes in the dungeons on dragonstone now i dont know how gendry will be saved but im feel sure he will bedavos saves edric after he was released from the dungeons he was put in there because he wanted to kill mel she saw that in the flames not because of edric so i assume this thing will work out just like the book except gendry will substitute edric"
"Xcorpyo001",2013-04-16,"if they removed edric storm completely from the picture maybe well see other changes as well maybe stannis will take gendry to the wall so he can meet jon and tell him about arya since he probably cant readwrite gendry can learn at the same time as davos davos will start to like gendry and probably take him under his protectiontwo tickets for skagos please ahhh a man can dream"

"aedalia",2013-04-17,"i get the logic in subbing gendry for edric but gendry has to get his arse back to the bwob maybe theyll do a big rescue thing in conjunction with davos freeing him"
"podrick_payne45",2013-04-17,"looking forward to seeing how the change plays out i liked edric strom in the book but i think this is fine since the actor playing gendry is pretty good"
"Drogo_1",2013-04-17,"as i thought more about this i decided that i would like it better if mel brings gendry back to dragonstone he learns to read and write with the dead girl and davos when mel has stannis convinced to burn him davos will send him across the narrow sea in hiding where he will again meet up with arya the assassin  ninja"
"Mammothsbane",2013-04-17,"as i thought more about this i decided that i would like it better if mel brings gendry back to dragonstone he learns to read and write with the dead girl and davos when mel has stannis convinced to burn him davos will send him across the narrow sea in hiding where he will again meet up with arya the assassin  ninjathis is possible i dont think the readingwriting thing will happen is it ever established that davos cant read or write it wouldnt make sense for mel to bring gendry back and then let him chill and learn to read and write for months theyd want to burn him right away the problem with this is that if gendry is smuggled out whats to stop mel from just going to get him again shes already left to find him once why not again"
"Runaway Penguin",2013-04-17,"i get the logic of not introducing too many bastards but i wonder how the davos arc will play out in books davos is made lord hand after interview with mel and another confrontation where she finds that he does not approve of her but is an absolutely loyal to stannis if the show has stannis giving handship to davos in a fit of mel left me and im all alone without anyone to advise me it would be a bit lame"

"Hand of the Kingslayer",2013-04-17,"i doubt theyll kill off gendry i doubt theyll even bring him back to dragonstone not that he plays a huge part after aria leaves the bwb other than saving brienne but i still cant see them killing him off my theory is that thoros will be the one who argues against the sacrifice of gendry having been good friends with robert and all and suggesting the leeching of the kings blood as being sufficient maybe mel just brings 3 fat leeches back to dragonstone"
"Drogo_1",2013-04-17,"the problem with this is that if gendry is smuggled out whats to stop mel from just going to get him again shes already left to find him once why not againwell in the books once edric storm leaves hes beyond mels reach because she would have to cross continents to get him it could be the same reason she wont be able to get to gendry"
"HouseLancaster",2013-04-17,"i think hell poss be killed my hope is that davos saves him and im still on board with the idea he meets brienne next season and travels with her and podrick in place of whathisface it works well for the tv audience since hell be doing it to look for arya and shell need his help to identify her plus this way both end up back in the same place with the brotherhood and at the mercy of ladystonestark where he saves her from biter"
"Teren_Kanan",2013-04-17,"depends whos higher up in the church of rhllor besides from one still i saw it looked like the only burn gendry is going to feel from mel is in his loins hell be the father of the shadow baby that takes out balonwhy would a shadow baby take out balon seems like that would kind of hurt the entire greyjoy arc"
"crazibouncer",2013-04-17,"melisandre is going to see bolton and ask him for 3 leeches that is totally what will happen on a serious notei guess i am fine with gendry tagging in for edric they just better not totally fuck his character over and kill him off a meeting between mel and thoros could be interesting too"
"victim",2013-04-17,"end of the day gendry was a pretty minor character in the books i did notice however that joe dempsie got promoted to series regular this season meaning hes going to have a much larger role in the show than he ever had in the books to be entirely honest i always thought he was a bit of an idiot and joe dempsies portrayal of his didnt really change that i welcome a change to his storyline where he learns of his lineage and learns to act like a lord so to speak as edric had i dont hate the idea of stannis releasing davos because melisandre has left in order to arrive at the stannis we all love they need to show davos and melisandre fighting for his soul so to speak which means they both need to get equal amounts of time with him davos also hasnt appeared for two episodes now and i really need him back in my life"

"Dove",2013-04-14,"yeah the unsullied are the outliers more than anything because theyre either bookwalkers or they fanatically analyze every frame most of the guys and gals i watch with are either assured that theon is with the ironborn think the bastard is the torturor and hes working aloneagainst his father for some reason or think locke is the bastard haha that ones my favoriteget dem tumblr filters ready lots of slow motion shots of ramsay giving theon long loving looks and vice versa perhaps with the caption he flays me because he cares in olde english fonthahahaha edited by huntington 14 april 2013  0756 pm"

"Mulled Wino",2013-04-15,"all this arguing about if theon deserved what happened to him is odd it looks like everyone agrees hes a piece of shit anyone arguing that anyone deserves to be skinned alive has some serious issues unless its the skinned person skinning whoever flayed him all in all theres a ton of things happening that people dont really deserve in the books"

"Tadco26",2013-04-15,"the only thing i can think of is maybe those werent actually ramsays men as in the bastards boys maybe they were dreadfort men but belonged to roose that were left to run the dreadfort could be why they called him a bastard so ramsay helps theon escape cause he knows those guys will go after him so he gets to fuck with theon and kill these guys so he can be in charge i dont know where the hell ramsay is taking him though unless he just turned around and unknowingly brought him back to the dreadforti was kinda confused with that whole partyes but roose said that his bastard would come free winterfell not his castellan or some one else implying that ramsay already was in charge its hard to say where the preview for next week was taking place it seemed likely that theon was being tortured at the dreadfort where else would they possibly be since we know winterfell burned but ramsay had theon ride east which removes the chance of deepwood motte which is the only place we know the ironborn have taken so far i thought maybe they were seriously time shifting theon helping take moat cailin but that wouldnt make much sense and like i said so far the show has not told us that the ironborn took moat cailin in the first place its not in the east and ramsay certainly wouldnt have the control over theon to make that a very logical plan to hope would succeed of course after the season 2 finale where sam was surrounded by white walkers and inexplicably lived maybe hoping for a logical conclusion is not necessarily going to happen"

"Dove",2013-04-17,"the ugly truth of the matter is that beautiful people are given a pass where ugly people are not even in these books characters that are written as beautiful and charming are given a pass by readers where others are not and there is a much better chance that tv ramsey played by a hot actor will have fans who will excuse what he does to theon thats my opinion it may be wrong but i still think its a creepy choice of all the characters to make significantly more handsome that they chose ramsey boltonpeople reveled in him and enjoyed his characterhis treatment of others in all sorts of gross ways even before this so you really cant let it bother you people will always wildly misinterpret things or latch on in the wrong way thats just a fact of enjoying fiction unfortunatelyiwan rheon is a really really good actor and hes super good at playing a megacreep and pulling weird faces i genuinely think hell be fantastic and im the worlds biggest critic of the ooh ramsaychan kind of bullshit"

"Spring Snow",2013-04-17,"edit someone mentioned last page that they might be in hornwood lands i didnt think of that by this point in the books hed already kidnapped lady hornwood and starved her so if hes acting lord of the hornwood now that would explain why hes secure enough in his position to run around indiscriminately killing his own men as a part of his game not that it needs an excuse at all since hes a crazy fuckerthis seems possible as does the dreadfort one of the nicest things about this particular story line is that were nearly as disoriented as the ones who havent read the booksi distinctly remember a shot of yara in one of the trailers released before the premiere aired so we know that shell have some sort of part to play this season whether it directly involves theon or is simply setup for the upcoming kingsmoot and ironborn conflict is anyones guess maybe shell just be there to remind us that balon exists before his death because most people have forgotten him"

"PhoenixFlame",2013-04-17,"shrug they cast an actor who could do disturbing sick puppy well iwan can play a very sick puppy i think theyre trying to make his unveiling epic and horrible because the show needs a villain who can fill the gap when joffers bites the dust say what you want about joffrey his actor is bloody fantastic at making you feel visceral loathing"

"Charles Phipps",2013-04-16,"ive stated to friends the shows should be 12 episodes a season rather than 10 and wed have a bit more room to breathe but the simple fact is the books are being condensed and things suffer on the other hand the show opens up new things like how do the riverlords feel about trading one king for another"
"Sir Noone Sword Of The Day",2013-04-16,"too many characters being introduced at one time is very bad my brother is the one who got me into the show which after the first season i decided to read all the books then i lost my social life however my point is that if the show introduces too many characters at once than the tv show fans would become way more confused my brother for example i have to constantly tell him who is who during the show because he is getting really confused between all the new and old characters so therefore i disagree with you in regards to brynden and edmure being introduced too late"
"SerArthurHeath",2013-04-16,"yeah if the tullys had been introduced in previous seasons there would have been too many characters to keep going even at the moment major characters have to skip episodes and that will only get worse and then keeping the minor characters actors on the books for multiple series is hard enough already"
"Toxspecific",2013-04-16,"i didnt like one thing if theyre going to show edmure as blundering more often than he does in the books  and taking flak for it from others  they should show catelyn as the one who comforts him in character and she was fond of him in the books"

"Buckwheat",2013-04-16,"i actually think the confusion about robbs plot makes more sense if robb and edmure have not already met before and robb had not chance to tell him about it so edmure did what he thought was necessary in the books where robb fails to explain the plan to him it is a little silly"
"Reposado",2013-04-16,"yeah the one thing thats impossible to do on a show is have a brief scene or two with a character that will have a bigger role in a future season just way to hard to hold on to the actor that its way better to just write around iti actually think the confusion about robbs plot makes more sense if robb and edmure have not already met before and robb had not chance to tell him about it so edmure did what he thought was necessary in the books where robb fails to explain the plan to him it is a little sillyyeah i think so although this reflects very badly on robb he apparently expected edmure to guess his planwasnt it a victory over tywin whole army in the books not just the mountain it was about drawing tywin west so he couldnt defend kings landing from stannis not about getting the mountains head on a stakeyeah thats how it went down but book robb was a lot smarter"

"Buckwheat",2013-04-16,"yeah i think so although this reflects very badly on robb he apparently expected edmure to guess his planyep that is stupid on robbs partyeah thats how it went down but book robb was a lot smarterhe was that is also true about jonim fine with bringing them in when they did while it would have been nice to see them earlier it didnt cost anything to have them added in when they didi agree the show has probably a hundred characters by now no idea i have not counted them tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp  so they really need to include whom they really need and no characters that might or might not become important two seasons later"

"Tadco26",2013-04-16,"i understand the need to limit cast numbers and story lines and therefore the need to delay the appearance of the tullys its a change that is regrettable but understandable to me it was a bit off kilter to have robb talking to edmure like they have known each other for years when as far as we know tv wise they just met for the first time it also begs the question of what was the blackfish doing while edmure was attacking the mountain he wasnt with robb and it seems odd that he would be chastising edmure now if he was part of that attack"

"Currawong",2013-04-17,"well you do have to follow the dialogue closely and understand matters that have obviously gone on before offscreen there are always certain things that are clearly implied by what is said or done it seemed perfectly clear to me from the riverrun scenes that in off screen actions1 robb and catelyn had met with edmure and brynden at least briefly before the actual funeral  i mean when we left them in ep 2 they were still on their horses going to rivverun so you you naturally assume that they had some sort of social interaction with the tullys when they arrived and didnt just leap off their horses and go straight to the riverbank where the funeral pyre boat was waiting2 robb had sent orders to edmure to hold his position at riverrun ie stay there the dialogue and acting made it very clear that he and brynden clearly didnt think robb needed to spell it out in words of one syllable to a man who is older than he is that this actually meant stay put  do not venture out  just stay where you are and defend against any attack these orders had been sent some time ago because clearly there has been a battle while robb was on the road and edmure is now back at riverrun looking forward to being praised for his victory at winning a mill at the cost of several hundred valuable knights edited by currawong 17 april 2013  0221 am"

"Ferrum Aeternum",2013-04-15,"stannis came across in the scene as desperate not so much desperate to bang melisandre right there on the beach but desperate to kill his rivals and regain the upper hand in the war his motivation for wanting mel appeared to be the creation of another shadowbaby to do his dirty work when mel counters that this isnt possible stannis backs off and goes cold as usual so on some level it made sense that said the scene was clumsily executed and poorly written surely the writers could have gotten the same point across without making stannis appear so pathetic although perhaps theyre wanting to demonstrate the depth of his dependence on mel"

"Penguin king",2013-04-15,"well he didnt leave her with a child in the first place his duty as a king should have been for his kingdom first and foremost  see halfhands lecture on honor vs duty instead he chose to  do the honorable thing  which meant utterly pissing off his most important ally in the south communication lines are even more important than riverrunhe didnt know if she was pregnant or not but he didnt want to take the chance growing up with jon he knew the stigma that a bastard could face he wanted to avoid making the same mistake that ned supposedly did  i agree that he had a duty to the frays as well and im not arguing that he made the wisest choice or even the right one the only point im makingis that we see robb doing what he feels is his duty even when he personally suffers for it stanniss duty always seems to coincide with his own personal gainstannis did not desire for the iron throne he felt slighted by getting dragonstone instead of storms end from robert but he did his duty and he did his duty when it was revealed that roberts sons isnt his then by law stannis is the rightful king you want to say he should have ignored the blatant violation and deception performed by lannistersout of the 5 kings stannis has the best claim i dont disagree with that all i disagree with is the idea that he doesnt want to be king he claims that storms end the handship and the iron throne arent things he ever wanted but they were all his by right that just seems really petty to me why get so upset by and go to such great lengths to gain titles that you dont even want if thats really the case then hes no better than gregor with his wooden knight in fact hes far far worse gregor immolated his brother to get back his toy how many men have died so that stannis can stop other people playing with hiseven if you think stannis is evil you have to admit hes lawful evil and so far in the show hes out of character bookwisei take a similar veiw to morality as davos there arent good people and evil people there are just people as davos says it seems to be that most men are grey stannis falls with most men id say and i agree he has often been out of character in the show and not always for the better i prefered his honesty in this scene but i can see why it would annoy a loy of people personally i hated it when he was storming the battlements at kings landing that seemed really out of character for where stannis was in the books at that time stannis is clearly willing to fight for his crown but leading the assult was nothing more than a sure way to get killed only plot armour saved him thereyou are putting cart before the horse here when did stannis put his ambition before the law the only time he was not lawful and instead dtiful was when he joined with his brother during the rebellion  and that again was not done out of ambition renly is putting ambition above the law and duty not stannisthe point im making is his duty and his ambition are one and the same being roberts hand was never his right but he acted like it was because he wanted the power he acts like the iron throne would be a terrible burden but hes willing to go to almost any length to sit on it his duty is only important when he stands to benifit even roberts rebellion took him from heir to the stormlands to heir to the throne he never seems to suffer for his duty"

"Rymun Royce",2013-04-15,"terrible how stannis was handled last episode i actually became a stannis fan after last season it got me thinking that actually stannis is the best choice to rule not to mention the actual legal one being that joff tom and myrcella are bastards born from incest and also considering the other pretenders from the war of the five kings robb may be considered a hero all you want and does have the blackfish at his side but he is still a boy although since the begining he was shown a keen ability to control his bannermen and fight battles but it all went to shit after he married jeyne after that the dude doesnt deserve a crown even robert baratheon knew what was he needed to do and thus married cersei balon is really just a pillaging prick and finally renly the queen thorns said it best being a sharp dresser and knowing how to smile does not make you a king stannis is actually battle hardened experienced in being but in the thick of it and persevering holding on to his duties he may not know how to treat others properly and maneuver in the game of thrones but davos certainly can and even florent was politically savy if a bit too brash stannis is apparently also an efficient administrator he would certainly not indulge in excesses would never trust someone like littlefinger or varys and much less pycelle who is really the worst of them all at least you feel a bit of respect from littlefinger and varys abilities pycelle is a rat the only thing would be that stannis would be incredibly ruthless but davos would certainly find a way to turn that into his favour by making selysse be a proper merciful queen but last nights episode with the whole i want you and that beaten crap stannis was not a wreack he was angry he was pissed off but he wasnt completely bummed he knew he needed to regroup hell they dont seem to even going to give stannis his moment of almost but not qutie redemption when he thinks about him killing renly"

"Rockroi",2013-04-16,"i just wanted to comment on thisout of the 5 kings stannis has the best claim i dont disagree with that all i disagree with is the idea that he doesnt want to be king he claims that storms end the handship and the iron throne arent things he ever wanted but they were all his by right that just seems really petty to me why get so upset by and go to such great lengths to gain titles that you dont even want if thats really the case then hes no better than gregor with his wooden knight in fact hes far far worse gregor immolated his brother to get back his toy how many men have died so that stannis can stop other people playing with histhis is not exactly what stannis is saying what stanni is saying is that whether or not he wants to be king is not a factor in his decision whether or not stannis wants to be king is immaterial even if its true that he does want to be king i think as proof we should look at stannis relationship with storms end especially after ropberts rebellion stannis was lord of se after robert left to war he held it against rediculous odds saving robert a fate that would befall robb 16 years later the loss of his home while fighting a war thousands of miles away after the war and as a slight so speaks cersei robert awards se to renly who was not a factor in the war stannis wants to be lord of se it is his right as oldest brother but his duty is to listen to his older brother so stannis concedes to duty even though his desire is to remain lord of se what stannis is claiming is that his right to be king just like his right to be lord of storms end  is not up to him its either a fact or its not as far as lord of storms end stannis is pissed that he was not lord of se but he accepted that robert his older brother and thus is leige lord  made renly lord of se so stannis accepted that fact irrespective of his own desires stannis duty duty overrode his desire in other words lets say we discovered tomorrow that tommen unlike joff was actually not the product of incest somehow stannis discovered this is there any doubt at all that he would drop his claim i mean everything else being equal stannis desire to be king would be unchanged but to stannis it would not matter he would not lawfully be king hence i know that stannis would not seek the throne just as he did not seek the lordship of se after robert awarded it to renly yes stannis was pissed but his desire never factored against his duty same was true during the war in choosing robert over aerys in taking dragonstone etc duty and law above all the point im making is his duty and his ambition are one and the same being roberts hand was never his right but he acted like it was because he wanted the powerno in fact i do not recall stannis ever being angry that he was not made hand stannis was very angry he was not made lord of se by right and that robert never loved him as he did ned stark and here i could see this but hand and recall robert choose jon arryn as hand and i am fairly certain stannis approved of this chocie after all it was stannis that jon went to to see gendryhe acts like the iron throne would be a terrible burden but hes willing to go to almost any length to sit on itbecause that is his duty again it does not matter that stannis wants the throne or not its his duty to be king and as far as a burden everyone seems to think it is and that burden carries rewards nobody denies thishis duty is only important when he stands to benifituntrue stannis took dragonstone because his duty compelled him to listen to robert even though his desire was to stay lord of se also recall that se provided him with massive advantages a richer house better lords greater armies etc but he took storms end despite his desires and because of his dutylet me put it one last way stannis is particularly angry at renly because renly knows he has no claim a fact echoed by tywin robb and lady olenna why because renly is shirking his duty to law honor and family for his own personal glory so ponder thisif renly were in fact older than stannis is there any doubt at all that stannis would have completely supported renly in his claim to unseat the usurper joffery i have no doubt that stannis would have been renlys most dedicated and vicious warlords just like he was probably roberts most dependable and steadfast supporters which is exactly why stannis hated renly because renly was never as loyal to stannis as stannis had been loyal to robert and i also believe that stannis could give two figs about what mel thinks of him as aa reborn etc he is using it all as a means to an end"
"Rymun Royce",2013-04-16,"i consider stannis the best choice out of the rebels from the war of the five kings not of all the realm and that doesnt make him the main character or deserving of it you can read about roberts rebellion from rhaegars point of view or better from jaimes arthur dayne or jon connington its still roberts rebellon its his war and he will win the crown doesnt make him the main character much less in the way grrm has written the series thats the point there is no main character you can choose who you want to follow until the second half of sow i didnt like jon or daenarys i was following tyrion and arya those were the ones i cared i also liked davos not only because he was our pov in stannis army but his inner thoughts are great that i consider him a good ruler doesnt make him my main character hell if i had to choose to nominate someone to rule i would think about kevan lannister or tyrion they are both smart men yet lack tywin cruelty and coldness both of them demostrated great ability particularly kevan even though tyrions biggest handicap was cerseis and joffreys stupidity and the fact that kevan was far more experienced and also had a whole lot of a mess to fix althoug of course having lit a war because you wanted to see a headless stark is ostensibly a bigger mess anyway regarding dragonstone it was a slight against stannis since as it has been said there was no love among those brothers but also indeed robert needed someone with experience to hold the targ seat my fav is tyrion hate to be one of the many tyrion fans but what can i do but my second favourite character is littlefinger i find his resentmen against nobles great to read even though he is just incredibly evil the man is worthy of respect he is smart manipulative even though i wasnt an eddard fan i felt sorry for him but from lf pov he just couldnt help it he made his own bed lf tried but couldnt help it edited by rymun royce 16 april 2013  1237 am"

"Khal Porno",2013-04-16,"i dont have a problem with humanizing him but the show writers are clearly trying to make him seem more ambitious and evili dont get the sense that he is evil at alland its harder to get more ambitious than wanting to take over an entire kingdom haha"
"SilentSense",2013-04-16,"they have shown stannis being strong and determined quite a bit and i would point to davos conversation to his son where he extolls stannis as fair just and virtuous viewers of the show will have seen all of that too does portraying him during a time of weakness ruin all of that no because we will see his character continue to developedit im also unsure of why a show watchers opinion of stannis needs to be the same as a book readers opinion they are two different things also it seems to me that a lot of book readers have different opinions of stannis than other book readers doif you dont care about whether and how closely show stannis resembles book stannis we have nothing to discuss im explaining why the scene was bad despite the fact that strong characters have moments of weakness again it has to do with how much a characters screen time is allocated to showing his main characteristics maybe their portrayal of stannis will become better doesnt change that this scene is misleading wrt portraying book stannis"

"Mr Hodor",2013-04-16,"it didnt destroy stannis for me i agree that the scene was cheesy bt they have to show melisandres influence on stannis in 5 minutes this in my opinion will leave out certain things if they had more time things wold have been different"

"devilrob6",2013-04-16,"i dont think the ruined stannis it seemed out of character but so was the scene on the table at dragonstone in season 2 which was worse but stannis after the blackwater was at his lowest point he gained a lot of sympathy in the books afterwards that could still happen in the series"
"Bastard of Boston",2013-04-16,"well truth be told i didnt fully come around on bookstannis until recently he was amazing once mel wasnt around im hoping the show will see him have a similar outcome im not a fan of how hes being portrayed right now too though i can only imagine that the writers are trying to emphasize the parasiticlike quality of mel coupled with showing how broken stannis is after black water maybe this is an exercise to show what stannis is like when mel is around vs when shes not who knows maybe now that mel is off to find gendry well see hints of stannis coming out of his crazed stupor thus revealing to the audience that mel is a very powerful and manipulative force i hope"
"Lord Varys",2013-04-16,"well im not sure if this truly a wrong portrayal of stannis how he was shortly after the blackwater melisandre may very well have been the sole straw he had left after his humiliating defeat she was the only one who was allowed to see him in the books as well and she obviously also was the one who got him out of his depression eventually this strongly indicates that stannis deeply cares for melisandre and is stricken that she might abandon him as well im sure book stannis would have acted in a similar fashion if mel would have asked him for an extended leave of absence without explaining anything he would have begged her to stay the weird thing seems to me that there is that there seems to be no intercourse between stannis and mel they had sex only once to conceive the shadow child in the novels mel seems to share her bed with stannis on a regular basis and this is not endangering his life at least thats how i interpret mels casual remark from adwd my guess was that mel can consciously control and decide whether she wants to drain a man of his life essence and conceive a shadow child or whether she wants just to have fun having stannis to want mel is no deviation from the books the man is attracted to melisandre that was always obvious but this does not mean that he is in her thrall or something like that and he also seemed afraidirritated about this whole sacrifice idea thing i dont see him not trying to resist the whole sacrifice idea when its finally put on the table at least at first the really irritating thing from season 2 is that he suddenly becomes all horny as soon as mel promises him a son thats out of character and strange but not so much the fact that stannis has actually sexual desires we should also keep in mind that there is a subtle hint in jons first chapter in adwd that stannis may actually be somewhat jealous of mels interest in jon snow when she decides to accompany him her interest in jon seems to irritate stannis but whether stannis truly is completely invested in melisandre emotionally remains to be seen the woman truly has a lot of attractive qualities but also a lot of weird and intimidating aspects he may be truly smitten by the fact that a woman as powerful as she is is interested in him but that may change eventually edited by lord varys 16 april 2013  1113 am"

"Sir Noone Sword Of The Day",2013-04-16,"im not sure why its been fast forward so much because it could have easily been aligned with the book aka having the whole arstan mystery included and belwas and then they could have had danys chapters at the end of asos at the end of hbos season 3 therefore making the season finale even more epic rather than just fast forwarding it so much"

"David Selig",2013-04-16,"emilia clarke is a good actress not her fault most of the material she got last season was awful so no surprise to see her doing very well this season when her script actually makes sense"
"Buckwheat",2013-04-16,"yes this season the essos scenes are much better than last seasons qarth i am not a fan of the aged up missandei but jorah and barristan work very well and dany has toned down the i will take   screaming so that is good she feels much more natural and mature also i liked the inclusion of jorahs sentence about rhaegar"
"Kittykatknits",2013-04-16,"im very happy with danys story this season its been refreshing to see her on screen once again so incredibly disappointed with the story given to her last season where she does nothing but threaten to burn everyone who doesnt give her what she wants and the awful dragonnapping storyline i had a positive feeling about her story arc this season within a few seconds of seeing the dragons and ship and havent been disappointed so far really hoping her character continues to get the credit it is due"

"mafalda",2013-04-16,"danys story last season was awful its because they made her look like a spoiled brat running around threatening to burn everyone and the ridiculous kidnapping of the dragons and they gave her the worst cheesy lines during the entire season i kept saying well they will make up for this with the hotu nope to add insult to injury they butchered that too even though i did love seeing jason momoa again they could bring him back every season finale and i wouldnt question it or complain at all they left out all her cool important visions i watched it with my bf and his friends who dont read the books and during the entire season i kept saying wait til you see the house of the undying its gonna be great and when it happened they were like well you overhyped that also the characters in astapor are great kraznys is slimy and despicable to the point that its hilarious im glad they skipped the arstan thing as much as i liked it in the books it would not have translated well on screen i do wonder what will happen though to cause the walk in the sewers now though and missandei is gorgeous and i love her dress and would wear it everyday to the supermarket the mall to concerts all day everyday people saying that they are not a fan of aged up missandei are missing one factor the show killed off all danys handmaidens theres one particular scene that involves dany and a handmaiden that im 100 positive they will include in the show and if they kept missandeis original age that would be messed up i love the aged up missandei she is hot so looking forward to danys arc this season i cant freaking wait for daario"

"Mendoza",2013-04-16,"theyve reduced tyrion to some sort of comedy relief in kings landing yucking it up with bronn over irrelevant matters all the other characters seem to be doing a travel log without much story movement thus danys has been the most compelling in my view thus far in season three i do think the locale in season three is a vast improvement for dany as well as her outfits her scenes are very cinematic"

"Ser Desmond Wine's Bane",2013-04-16,"but she does best when the writing is lifted from the bookactually i think that goes for all the scenes in the show so far there arent many invented scenes that dont seem off somehow some work really well but a lot dont i have heard show watchers saying as much that scene with x in it seemed different somehow id argue that that is the problem with all of ross scenes the actor doesnt have the book or advisers who know the book to fall back to for advice as to how the scene should be played out"

"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2013-04-16,"regardless of the dullness of the material an actor can improve it or at least not annoy emilia seems to have improved so far at least to me and theyve thankfully done a great job of adapting those early scenes to be enjoyable even though almost nothing really happens when you think about it yet"
"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-04-16,"book dany essentially was marking time a lot as events unfolded in westeros and i think it weakened her character the need for the show to condenseomit some things in the interest of time should result in less filler and more focus that should help kit harringtoni found book jon pretty obnoxiousimmature much of the time so i actually think theyre doing a pretty good job with him so far"

"Tadco26",2013-04-15,"i agree with rans analysis its a problem the show has had since season 1 its not that their is anything wrong with sex scenes the problem is that they cover the average chapter of material in 35 minutes having 7 minutes focused on this scene is like martin spending 2 full chapters on a sex scene rather than 12 pages or less which is typically the case there are also as many defenders of the sex scenes like to point out many sex scenes actually in the books to choose from there shouldnt be such a need to make up new ones and the writers reminding us how they dont have time to keep other parts of the book falls flat when the add such pointlessly long scenes to the show having said all that it was mildly entertaining well acted and if they had 16 or even 12 episodes instead of 10 i wouldnt have minded it nearly as much its more a matter of there being more important and interesting story lines to follow and a lack of time to show them all that bothers me"

"jarl the climber",2013-04-15,"pod stays loyal to tyrion throught the book even after he flees so they are kind of laying the groundwork for that this is the sort of thing an older man would do for a young protege to reward him and insure his continued loyalty so while the scene might seem gratuitious its also a psychological ploy on tyrions part to bind pod to him being an older guy and introducing a younger guy to the world of women really does give the older guy a suprising amount of influence over the younger fellow street gangs and othe organisations use this technique in their recruiting"

"Theda Baratheon",2013-04-16,"hmm i didnt say you couldnt criticize though it sounds more you are the one trying to shut me up not the other way aroundwhats the bad argument if sexism is something you feel strongly about and you find evidence for it in a show you watch why is it such a leap that you would choose not to consume said showi think youre getting a bit personal now i dont want to shut any body up this subforum is here for discussion i dont think the show is sexist i said it isnt as black and white as that but it is perpetuating sexist themes so because i have a personal fault with one area of a show i ultimately enjoy very much please dont tell me that it would be best for me to cease watching the show entirely thats a very strange argument i ask you again why are you visiting this subforum you are here to talk about this episode to discuss it critique should be welcome within the sphere of discussion"
"oakenhelm",2013-04-16,"like i said before sex scenes dont bother me but dont tell me how much of a problem it is to include things from the book due to lack of time when you create a 7 minute plot that revolves completely around a sex scene they made up there are as many have pointed out quite a few sex scenes in the book i dont see the need to make up new ones when they are so strapped for screen time especially since the average chapter of material is covered in 35 minutes making this pod scene the virtual equivalent of if grrm had written 2 chapters revolving around a single sex sceneif it were up to me i would trade plot for tits and ass every time but the show is what it is and isnt changing"

"Jolene Brown",2013-04-16,"i liked the scene with viserys and doreah  in season one a lot it both deeply humanized him and reminded us that he was deeply screwed up at the same time by how he lashed out at her when he realized he was letting her see his vulnerability the scene with bronn last year in blackwater is a good contrast in the negative direction it could not have been more blatantly obvious that that scene existed for the most part as a reason to show a naked woman it also didnt really feel like they were at a brothel as i remember it so when he completely undressed her it felt very weird and out of place to me like if you were drinking at a bar and some guy at the corner table took off all the clothes of a woman he was flirting with its not just that it pulls me out of this specific story sometimes it makes me wonder about hbo in general whether their entire its not tv its hbo thing is basically just sort of a gimmick to disguise that they dont actually care about telling these stories much instead they mostly care more about having an excuse to provide boobs and sex to dudes because its like real and adult i mean i suppose that as long as the shows have genuine quality many would say who cares but it seems almost creepy to me in a way why should female actresses have to make this decision about whether they are willing to get naked in order to be on an hbo show when male actors dont have to make that decision it is really starting to bother me despite the fact that the wire deadwood and others are among my favorite shows of all time there is such a clear and demonstrable pattern there edited by jolene brown 16 april 2013  0406 pm"

"Currawong",2013-04-17,"so i watched the episode again tonight and i timed this scene because i thought the 7 minutes that people are throwing around seemed longer than it really was turns out the scene with the prostitutes was less than two minutes long the dialogue with pod when he returned was barely over a minute a little more than three minutes of levity is hardly a waste of a huge chunk of timeexactly especially in an episode where there was so much sadness and real darkness  the episode even starts with a funeral and goes on to the aryagendryhot pie farewell then we get to the really dark stuff like the godfatheresque horse head circle after the battle beyond the wall crasters keep with gilly giving birth and the knowledge of what will happen to a boy baby the slaves in astapor and the walk of punishment all the theon stuff including the chase and the rape threat jaime brienne with another threatened pack rape and then the loss of his hand i dont begrudge a tv show giving us moments of humour as juxtaposition even if invented humour in a brothel and in e 3 it was particularly necessary in fact the humour in the brothel scene and the musical council chairs part only served to make the darkness darker not to mention that the obligatory brothel scene every few episodes is almost a standing joke as regards the show itself and you have to admit there were some lovely touches in the ep 3 scene  the podtyrionbronn interaction the meerenese knot reference and the whole absurdity of the kingdoms financial books being kept in a brothel dont know what that actually says about the state of the finances lol but it seems that tyrion is rapidly finding out and if you relax and watch the show as a show you will see that even moments of humour have their subtleties and often tell us little things about the characters or the story itself at times the various rosshae and brothel scenes have seemed almost like a weird greek chorus giving us a view of events and people that we perhaps dont get in the books because of the pov structure and grrms unreliable narrator writing edited by currawong 17 april 2013  1227 am"

"lostinwesteros",2013-04-15,"i did initially have problems with the actor chosen to play mance but ive gotten used to him now and kind of like him but i dont have the problem you mentioned with how mance is portrayed i see his use of humor just last night the if jon doesnt help tormund in preparing to climb the wall then throw him off a cliff although im sure there was a serious underpinning to that comment as i think hes still not completely sold on jon i think it was meant in am offhanddry humor way"
"Bluemangosteen",2013-04-15,"i was really looking forward to ciaran hinds as mance but like others i am sorely disappointed in mance and torben  har i feel that mance is indistinguishable from qhorin the north has become such a letdown"
"Gannicus",2013-04-15,"hes missing some charisma and cool that i had envisioned but hes not so bad"
"Mother of Mini Dragons",2013-04-15,"for me its not just mance that bothers me but the way that the wildlings are being portrayed i thought that one of the most important aspects of jon infiltrating the wildlings is that we got to see their humanity their humor and that these are really just regular people with families that have a different philosophy on ruling themselves i enjoy the wildlings as a group in the books because of those qualities and right now the show is not showcasing it at all everything is really grim and bleak and grey and hard i was more looking forward to tormund than mance and im still waiting patiently to see more of his personality shine through"
"lostinwesteros",2013-04-15," bluemangosteen 10 above what i really really agree with is that the north has been a huge disappointment in this season and in last actually the opening part of episode 1 that showed sam being attacked by a wight was such a cheat i thought as has been all the rest above the wall"

"Xcorpyo001",2013-04-15,"i wouldnt mind a little more charisma he should be a tywin of the north so far he is closer to the hound"
"Winterfellian",2013-04-15,"jons storyline completely sucks so i supposed mances portrayal fits right in anyway i love love book mance but show mance doesnt do it for me at all i dont care if the actoractress looks exactly like the book counterpart but mances problem is beyond that the characterization is all wrong he has been stripped of everything that made him that amazing character in the books his love of life and freedom his taste for music and women his charisma to win others with a song etc and turn him into a tywinjeor mormontumber copy"

"Nezzer",2013-04-15,"i like showmance the only thing that bothers me is that they are giving so little screen time to mance he has appeared for like 10 minutes in all three episodes combined and it looks like we wont be seeing him until episode 10 now"
"Mulled Wino",2013-04-15,"these two quotes sum up the problem perfectly jon is supposed to be learning about what their freedom means things are still supposed to be grim but the point is to show him that they still have the joy of free human spirit when he finally succumbs to ygritte the viewerreader is supposed to be convinced that he really truly has turned to the side that fights for the livingand i really wanted to hear the dornishmans wifesince we cantt like anymore you get a well said"

"DrRobotnik",2013-04-15,"come on dont be stupid mance could be stern  serious if he wanted how else do you think he made himself king beyond the wall"
"DrRobotnik",2013-04-15,"for me its not just mance that bothers me but the way that the wildlings are being portrayed i thought that one of the most important aspects of jon infiltrating the wildlings is that we got to see their humanity their humor and that these are really just regular people with families that have a different philosophy on ruling themselves they might be saving that for dance with dragonsremember theyll need to spend two seasons minimum on dwd  ffc one season will take you till wildlings stream through gate then theyll need to develop wildling culture and its good to have a whole season dedicated to that"
"TheDarkOne",2013-04-15,"only renly was possibly cast worse the guy playing him from rome is so far off base i dont even know what to say its just unbelievable as others have pointed out he is no different than a handful of other generic representation of his character type on this show not in the books of course"
"-Ghost-",2013-04-15,"im sure this has been expressed elsewhere but are we going to see dallanope not this season anyway"
"Xcorpyo001",2013-04-15,"and i really wanted to hear the dornishmans wifei was hoping to hear the last of the giantsbut since the first scene when jon is taken to mance where we actually get to see something resembling a free folk camp everything else is a major letdown one single scene of a camp and for the rest we have 510 people moving around the snow i was so disappointed by the entire northern arc i dont even have words to describe it i was expecting so much more from the free folk customs and way of life jon and ghost the fist mance thormund giantsbabe sam all of iti cant believe im saying this but i even miss varamyrso for me mance isnt the only thing coming up short of expectations in the north"
"Janicia",2013-04-15,"i think dallas absence is a big part of the problem mance should be serious when hes leading his troops and looking at the work of the others the womanloving relaxed mance isnt going to come across without a woman and without seeing more of him during his downtime since thoros is singing all the time mance cant do that but he could hang out in the corner playing the guitar while tormund drinks not sure thats really worth the screen time on the other hand mance presenting a stern face to jon at this point is logical in the book it seemed like mance exposed himself to jon more and trusted jon more than he should have"
"Rapsie",2013-04-15,"honda wouldnt have been my first choice for mance but its not too bad and the problem maybe just the lack of screen time the change in tormund is more upsetting as some levity might have been nice in someone apart from bronn i havent seen episode 3 yet but do we really need another added bronn  tyrion scene good as they are other characters are being left out and not developed edit for honda reads hindsdamn autocorrect edited by rapsie 15 april 2013  0120 pm"
"Dysun",2013-04-15,"the wildlings have had 10 minutes through 3 episodes i cant really complain about his portrayal i havent seen enough of it"
"Sun",2013-04-15,"show mance just doesnt have the charisma and the energy of book mance thats what you get when you hire ciaran hinds for the part you get an older graver all together heavier and more dramatic mance i prefer book rayder but then again i knew i wasnt getting him as soon as i heard the news of the casting so im over it"
"Tyrion4President",2013-04-15,"so i see over and over people are upset with the way mance is being portrayed from what i gather people dont like that hes so stern and serious yes i understand he is not the colorful bard from the books but im just not sure it fits the theme north of the wall on the show the show has build mance is the hardened battle commander and i think that is the right theme north of the wall is so dire and there is the under layer of fear and cold and all the scenes are portrayed as such the jovial bard side of mance i think would be off putting to the dire and serious northbut it is still early overall i think the show is just matching mance to the north themei disagree mance was a crow originally from south of the wall he would not have the same serious tendencies as the rest of the northerners"
"-Ghost-",2013-04-15,"they made mance and tormund and the rest of the wildlings just too serious its like they took mances reason for becoming king if you dont follow me youre all gonna die or whatever it was and made them all only about that yes there were serious moments in the books with them and the threat of death was always with them but they still had fun and were full of life and emotions i cant picture them singing last of the giants or tormund threatening to kill rattleshirt for jon or bragging about himself and his kids mance is only in 3 episodes this season so thats the last well see of him for a while i think i dont expect we will be hearing any singing or any of his great stories"
"Mother of Mini Dragons",2013-04-15,"im also waiting for tormund to say har"
"Ser Desmond Wine's Bane",2013-04-15,"the guy playing him from rome is so far off base i dont even know what to say its just unbelievable as others have pointed out he is no different than a handful of other generic representation of his character type on this show not in the books of coursethat isnt the fault of the actor he is only following the script and direction he is given hinds was probably never going to be able to pull off quite the joviality of book mance but they were never going to have the time nor the need to show the complete depth of character to those levels he is certainly capable of showing some of the jovial nature with the ability to show the strength of a leader who could and would kill on a whim if required but he cannot do those things if they arent in the script or directionthe fault is not with hinds"

"Cas Stark",2013-04-15,"again i agree the budget for jons story would have been better spent on writing to bring out the characters than on going to iceland who cares if they are in iceland if all they do is trudge around for a few minutes every week and nobody gets enough screen time for a non reader to know anything or care they already butchered the halfhands story last season by not spending enough time on it and the same thing is happening now with mance no wife no cloak with red thread in it and no personality"

"Maester Ruin",2013-04-15,"turnocloak is most likely derived from turncoat which is another word for traitor and theon did betrayed starks as everyone pointed out his fathers wish was never to take winterfell theon did it on his own his father hadnt told him to burn the children theon did it he did maybe the right thing to obbey his side and shift his allegeance but that still makes him turncloak and he was fed with starks raised with them robb named him practicly his closest advisors theon betrayed that trust and thats why he is turncloaktheon was never a turncloak because his cloak was always marked with the golden kraken of house greyjoy i feel like i have to stress that in the feudal society a nobleborn man was expected above all to obey and bring glory to his father and house theon was always a greyjoy and even if he grew up to be robbs best friend the day robb sent him to pyke he officially released him from his hostage position and turned him over the balon i know it was done with mutual good intentions from both theon and robb regarding the war against the lannister but none of them expected balon to do the contrary of what robb proposed and instead of aiding the north with the powerful iron fleet he decided to use it to raid and invade the north it was a tough decision for theon but the laws dictated that he had to obey his father or he would have been branded a real traitor afaik balon never said do not take winterfell whatever you do he said something like the north is open for the taking castles field and mine will be ours winterfell might defy us for a year but what of it  implying that they planned to sooner or later lay siege to winterfell aswell contrary to what asha said when she visited theon in wenterfell winterfell is hundreds of miles from the sea and our power comes from our shipsbalon obviously intended to lay siege on winterfell why else would he estimate how long the northerners could hold ittheon took winterfell because his father did not respect him and thought him weak and loyal to the starks so naturally taking winterfell would hit two flies in one hit both showing his talent for strategy by taking the most fortified castle in the north with just a skeleton cew and forever distancing him from the starks i also think the socalled experienced raiders on the sea bitch in the lust for battle and disrespect for theon kinda provoked him to do something that drastical to prove himself he should of course have realized that he could never hold the heart of the north alone so early before the major shore invasions had been launched anthe few stark loyalist forces that where left in the north where busy fighting off the coastal raids but i think he was too eager to prove himself to pay attention to that level of strategyi do think balon was stupidstubborn and decided to let his lust to constantly belittle and humiliate his sons exploits take the first seat to his common sense kinda like tywin regarding tyrion winterfell is one of the best fortified seats in westeros and had he only sent a couple hundred men along with asha winterfell could have repelled ramsays army while keeping the northern army occupied trying to take back the northern capitol and hence leaving the shores vurnerable taking winterfell should also have proved to balon that theon was loyal to his family and that he had forever forsaken the starks but i dont think any efforts from theon could have pleased balon at this point he was obviously unjustlu projecting his own faliures and the humility of being forced to send away his last son to be raised a prisoner on to theontldr theon never betrayed robb because he never swore an official oath or vow to robbs cause and feudal law and tradition forced him to obey his father he was the last male heir of balon and was therefor expected to serve him by law and traditionhe did however regretfully betray a good friends trust but robb should have listened to cat before releasing theon to go home and bring a proposal to a man robb had never met and had no idea of which side he was on while at the same time giving back the hostage that had kept balon passive for the last decadesblood is thicker than water theon did betray his former best friends wishes but he did what was expected of him as the son of a powerful lord and it was pretty clear that it was not an easy decision for theon the scene where he burns the warning letter etcother crimes like killing the innocent farmer orphans are of course inexcusable like most things that happened in feudal warfare but still understandable since his surrounding group of ironmenramsay were constantly pushing him over the edge by telling him how an ironborn is expected to act wich theon never really knew before he was introduced to his crew at the sea bitch as a young man who had spent most of his life as a prisoner in another house and after being cursed and ridiculed by his own father upon his return theon was desperate to prove himself and gain the respect from pretty much anyone"

"TheAwesomeVargoHoat",2013-04-15,"i think jaime got exactly what he deserved its a fair punishment losing his hand for crippling bran bran loses the use of his legs jaime loses the use of his sword arm its about as fair a punishment as you can get he took away a kids ability to live his dreams i think people forget that considering bran gets new dreams after getting pushed out a window as for theon he gets far worse all for just trying to please his father if he actually killed bran and rickon then i can see a little bit of torture being dished out but he didnt it wasnt even his idea to kill the millers boys it was all ramsay theon gets by far the worst hand dealt in the series i would love if hes the one who kills ramsay in the next book though i dont see him lasting very long"
"Ser Greguh",2013-04-15,"theon did swear an oath to robb at least in the show his father put him in an impossible position but what followed from that was essentially a conga line of his failures his insecurity his drive for glory and his fathers respect and a morethansubstantial sadistic streak torture is of course not justice but if were taking the westerosi moral code as the standard here theres no question that losing his head would be justice he murdered two completely innocent boys and had their bodies tarred and put on display even in the context of warfare thats beyond the pale he garners sympathy because hes in a situation that nobody deserves no matter how heinous their crimes but my own sympathy is still severely dampened because theons crimes are heinous jaime is more complex if he werent a valuable hostage he would have been executed on the spot after confessing to his attemted murder of bran and i dont think many people would say its wasnt justice maiming him is cruel but there have been plenty of societies throughout history that lopped off hands as punishment for petty theft and westeros isnt far removed in its moral code from those societies the cruelty is amplified in jaimes case because his sword hand is so inexorably tied to his identity it is more cruel to him than it would be to an ordinary person from that perspective but thats not much of a standard for justice"

"Maester Ruin",2013-04-15,"can you please clarify that you are appealing to the standards of medieval ethics with regard to the orphanswell i can only speak about my personal opinion but i think that killing innocent children regardless if its 2013 or 6000bc or anywhere between is an evil repulsive act  perhaps the most repulsive and inhuman thing you can possibly do i skip past the goryviolent parts of many episode never managed to see through jofferys whore scenebut after spending a few years studying history and historical warfare i can tell you that there have been eras in many parts of the world where these artrocities have been practised without punishment neither from court church or king just a few prominent examples 12001500 great brittain and most of central europe 12001600 japan the early maya and inca civilizations where its somewhat disputed to wich extent and for how long the practice of sacrifising newborns to recieve the gods blessing was practiced but we know that it happened germany 19301940 my fathers great uncle died in a camp at 14 years oldmy point is that during different time periods and different parts of the world these things have happened quite reguarly im not saying that i support it in any way im just pointing out that apparently people have always been capable of brutal horrific violence different eras seem to have had different zeitgeists where it was easy to get away with these horrid acts for as long as you had godthe kingright social classsimple military supremacy on your side in europe it was particularly common for nobles pretenders and even kings who fell out of popularity to be murdered in the most gruesome ways and those who did it got away sometimes with lands and titles and the people seemed to welcome that the incompetent king finally got what he deserved or that upstart noble was cut in 8 pieces in the middle of the battlefield and each part was sent to his main lieutanants and supporters to show the ursurpers what happens to those who challange the crown just like in game of thrones people wrote ballads about these violent and horrific happenings in feudal japan there are many reports of warriors slicing up little children simply for getting in their way or not showing proper respect for the warrior class im sure people were horrified like i would be but this was simply a part of life in these periouds certain factions gained uncontested power and could do whatever they wanted regardless of what anyone thought violence ruled the world during this era and if you where just a simple merchant you did not even want to look a samurai in the eyes because he might take it as a slight and cut your head off in one swift moveagain im just using a few examples here and im not defending any of these acts im just pointing out that they have happened many times through history and the most violentdestructive factions have generarlly dictated the rules of society and when violence rules it breeds more violence from other factions if you just browse through some history pages about the royal house of brittain or pretty much any royal house in europe or aisa between the dark ages and the reniasennce you will find that its filled with brutal murder torture mutilation and decapitation between brothers cousins sometimes even mothers having their and sons brutally killed this is the sort of time period in wich game of thrones takes place except with fantasy elements the history of royal house plantagenet and the war that followed their rule between the two most prominant surviving cadet branches called the war of the roses wich the first book in the series was heavily inspired by is filled with murders of innocent children to remove them from the line of succesion exiled kings getting killed because of their sexual orientation by a burning poker in their anus young princes using contacts at court to arrange their brothers to be locked into towers to starve so that the young one could skip ahead in the line of succesion prehistoric living sacrifice of both infants and newborn babies aswell as virgins and young girls 60000 innocent women being tortured and killed after being accused of being witches spreading the black deathhistory is full of dark memories im glad that we live in this modern age but you kinda have to accept that game of thrones takes place in a different time period where the feudal lords with power could do pretty much whatever they wanted and making examples out of enemies was a common principle good examples of this in game of thrones is aerys ii gregor clegane joffery roose and ramsay bolton theon after he lost his mind and so on the only family with a set of moral principles are the starks and the tyrells and other nobles of the reach save for randyll tarly seem pretty elegant and peaceful"
"Mladen",2013-04-15,"well i can only speak about my personal opinion but i think that killing innocent children regardless if its 2013 or 6000bc or anywhere between is an evil repulsive act  perhaps the most repulsive and inhuman thing you can possibly do i skip past the goryviolent parts of many episode never managed to see through jofferys whore scenebut after spending a few years studying history and historical warfare i can tell you that there have been eras in many parts of the world where these artrocities have been practised without punishment neither from court church or king just a few prominent examples 12001500 great brittain and most of central europe 12001600 japan the early maya and inca civilizations where its somewhat disputed to wich extent and for how long the practice of sacrifising newborns to recieve the gods blessing was practiced but we know that it happened germany 19301940 my fathers great uncle died in a camp at 14 years oldfirst i have to say i really love your post its quite interesting to read and most informative but this isnt about killing children we know of unsullied and gregors case we all know the cases where children would end up dead and sadly like you pointed out there were times in history when killing babies wasnt such great crime it wasnt even called attrocity as long as it served its purposetheons story isnt just about killing 2 innocent children its more than that and i understand people who call him turncloak for i understand the perspective they are watching him from he was raised in winterfell was fed by the food they all ate he played with them and he was taken care of starks were his family just as ned and robert looked at jon arryn as member of their family just like olyvar frey hadnt participated in rw family isnt just the people we share blood with its those that we know and feel love for them and thats why theon is turncloak not because others see him as one than because he betrayed people he loved and he did loved starks we at least know that"
"Maester Ruin",2013-04-15,"son should obbey his father but he should never break his word i am sorry but i cant see plausible reason for me to believe that theon hadnt betrayed robb from any perspective ned and cat wasnt maybe the kindest people to theon but robb trusted him like ahe would trust a brother and thats why theon is turncloak not because he obbeyed his father or did what any son would do its because he totally turned against robb whom he was friend with and attacked winterfell and in the eyes of everyone killed and burned 2 boys he shared bread and salt with1 you are right2 but of course theon was in a loselose scenario king robb sent him to pyke with a lets be honest embarasingly bad plan and proposal that he and theon had come up with just to get the plot going i knew instantly that it was not going to work because apparently everyone knows how much balon hates the starks except for king robb stark whatever lets stop talking about robb now and by this time theons father had also named himself king of the iron islands so it basicly came down to the king who is your best friend and thinks of you as a brother and his most loyal companion or the king who shares your blood and was one of the two individuals who brought you into the worldno matter what side he chooses even if the laws of men says that it is his duty to obey his father and bring glory to his house but we will look past those tiresome laws and traditions and simply answer your question he will be a turncloak to one part1 had he sided with robb he would have brought great dishonour to his house by robbing his father of his male heir in favor of serving the stark family wich is not very popular on the iron islands a big dishonor for the grejoy family to have their only male heir turned into a stark lackey this would mean that his value as a hostage would dissapear since he has openly sided with the starks so they can stil start their invasion and it might be even wiser to keep theon in a cell so he wont be able to bring robb any information this is of course pure speculation but who knows what would have happened to theon if he just told the old kraken to fuck off im with the king of the north2 theon sides with balon because he craves his and the ironmens approval as we know he becomes a prince of the iron islands but nobody gives him the respect a prince from the mainland would recieve this convinces him further that he has to prove himself by doing something spectacular taking the heart of the north we all know how this ends and its a sad storry for theon rodrick luwin theons ironborn soldiers the orphan farmboys and pretty much everyone involvedbut my point remains regardless wich side he picked he would have been regarded as a turncloak from the other side and turncloak and bloodtraitor by the other its pretty hard to say whats worse betraying your adoptive brother and best friend or betraying your father and family when both claim to be kings"
"Mladen",2013-04-15,"but of course theon was in a loselose scenario ah antigonas tragic quilt i like the concept and i couldnt agree more whatever he had done he would be dismayed by someone poor theon he wanted family and love and now he has none he is tragic character on so many levels thats why i think it wasnt justice what ramsay had done to himas for turncloak term i understand the reasoning but for me theon betrayed himself and the day he killed those two boys he lost himself in the show there is a brilliant line the last words of rodrick cassel  gods save you theon greyjoy for now youre truly lost and that depicts theons storyline from that moment until reek and his escape from winterfell"
"Maester Ruin",2013-04-15,"theons story isnt just about killing 2 innocent children its more than that and i understand people who call him turncloak for i understand the perspective they are watching him from he was raised in winterfell was fed by the food they all ate he played with them and he was taken care of starks were his family just as ned and robert looked at jon arryn as member of their family just like olyvar frey hadnt participated in rw family isnt just the people we share blood with its those that we know and feel love for them and thats why theon is turncloak not because others see him as one than because he betrayed people he loved and he did loved starks we at least know thatagree and this is why his trip to pyke was such a tragic bad idea the naive theon thought his father would throw the biggest welcome party the iron islands had ever seen upon his return but was instead met with scorn because he had forgot his ironborn identity and culture and robb never considered to ask someone about why balon raged a rebellion why his last son grew up among his family as a hostage or what balon thought about the starks in general almost every noble from his fathers generation or older should know about the death of the greyjoy sons at the hands of stark men and that combined with the fact that his father had to demand balons last son as a hostage to guarantee that the iron i would be peaceful should really have been enough information to throw this idea out of the window and keep theon as far away from balon as possible i sorta blame both for being naive and not digging into the past before acting on their impulse"
"Mladen",2013-04-15,"agree and this is why his trip to pyke was such a tragic bad idea the naive theon thought his father would throw the biggest welcome party the iron islands had ever seen upon his return but was instead met with scorn because he had forgot his ironborn identity and culture and robb never considered to ask someone about why balon raged a rebellion why his last son grew up among his family as a hostage or what balon thought about the starks in general almost every noble from his fathers generation or older should know about the death of the greyjoy sons at the hands of stark men and that combined with the fact that his father had to demand balons last son as a hostage to guarantee that the iron i would be peaceful should really have been enough information to throw this idea out of the window and keep theon as far away from balon as possible i sorta blame both for being naive and not digging into the past before acting on their impulsewell ned hadnt killed theons brothers lord jason mallister i think killed one and the other was killed by unknown man so balon was exaggerating when he said that wolves killed his sons"
"Maester Ruin",2013-04-15,"thanks for the correction i just want to point out that its easy to call theon a turncloak because we saw him getting along well with the starks for most of the series but remember that particularly in the series there are many scenes with ros for example where he talks about his home and his future as lord of pyke i interpreted this that while he enjoyed being around the starks theon has a slightly arrogant narcisstic side that has issues with being a lord and a hostage at the same time because it simply hurts his pride he also seems to have a naive completley unrealistic concept of the iron islands being a place straight out of the fairytales where only the hardest men in the world live and that his house despite its many failed rebellions and poor resources is one of the most intimidating houses in the seven kingdoms his ignorant comment from the series when talking about tyrion to ros we have been lords of the iron islands for 300 years a very short time compared to stark lannister and arryn who trace their line directly from the first men or the age of heroes thousands of years ago there is not a family in westeros that can look down on us not even the lannisters kinda shows how ignorant he is and makes you wonder if he really knows that the ironborn are far past their prime when they controlled huge areas of the mainlands and are now stuck on the iron islands wich are just a bunch of small rocky islands with hardly no valuable resources at allthats why i find theon such a well written almost shakespearian character he started of as a handsome ambitious and loyal man who wanted to help his adoptive brother but ended up having to sacrifise his loved ones for a chance for glory under his bitter condemning and halfmad father with his strong ambition to prove himself to his native people ultimately costing him more than he ever imagined including parts of his soul and identety and ultimately he was turned into mutilated freak living amonst rats who could barely even remember his name with both body and soul destroyed beyond repair altough i do still wish for his death it is now maybe more out of sympathy and mercy than hate and lust for revenge either way there is no salvation for prince greyjoyhe is a good portrayal of the tragic naive opportunist who is proud to the point of ignorance and who seeks to be in control but always end up being manipulated by worse and worse people edited by maester ruin 15 april 2013  1108 pm"
"Ser Desmond Wine's Bane",2013-04-15,"well i can only speak about my personal opinion but i think that killing innocent children regardless if its 2013 or 6000bc or anywhere between is an evil repulsive actjust to clarify i never meant to intimate that you would actually think otherwise i apologise if that is how it soundedas to your piece excellent post if there was a kudos button i would be hitting itwith regards to the list of areas and times when brutality occurred you can add the roman empire during the medieval period and the lead up to it yeah that bit that is quite falsely labelled the byzantine empire by the german holy roman empire revisionists rather than outright execution it was almost standard practice for facial mutilation of pretenders and those expelled from the throne gelding was rarer but not unheard of england and france had their policy of holding high born prisoners for ransom but the rest of the civilised world was less accommodatingwhen the vikings and northmen unleashed across europe north africa the russias and to the gates of constantinople itself they discovered this wonderful system of government invented by emperor diocletian already in place called feudalism this meant they owned all the peasants in the lands they settled the wealth they earned allowed them to set up two very powerful kingdoms england and southern italy but it also entrenched the practice of abuse of the peasants simple to do they were property with no legal rights especially difficult for the peasants because they were gauls and anglosaxons being ruled by the germanic franks and the norsewhich leads me to thishistory is full of dark memories im glad that we live in this modern age but you kinda have to accept that game of thrones takes place in a different time period where the feudal lords with power could do pretty much whatever they wanted and making examples out of enemies was a common principle good examples of this in game of thrones is aerys ii gregor clegane joffery roose and ramsay bolton theon after he lost his mind and so on the only family with a set of moral principles are the starks and the tyrells and other nobles of the reach save for randyll tarly seem pretty elegant and peacefuli do accept that the milieu of a medieval world is what we are dealing with in game of thrones and that we have to accept an alien ethical code compared to what we are fortunate to live under in many places of the world today part of that acceptance is to recognise that there is a different ethical code operating with regard to the treatment of the lower classes in general and the orphans in particularbut once you make that justification then you also must accept the totality of the medieval ethical milieu that this fantasy series operates in under this same regime and as you have stated in historical cases brutality and torture of highborn persons is accepted practice there was no geneva convention for the treatment of pows torture for the purposes of interrogation was absolutely standard practice under the system and theons treatment thus far is perfectly justified in this world you cant appeal to medieval ethics in the case of the orphans then deny it in the case of theons initial violent interrogation as represented in the showeverything from here on in is not justified though and that is the art of grrms work it makes people wonder where the line was that they crossed before they realise they might have gone too far with support the maltreatment of theon i do not support the treatment he has had so far  he should have got the chop  but it is justified within this world edited by ser desmond wines bane 15 april 2013  1107 pm"

"WinterisAlwaysComing",2013-04-16,"okay the show itself isnt in decline obviously which is what jumping the shark indicates but man they at least pulled a jar jar binks unnecessary cuteness which almost ruins the whole thing that said the music did have something to do with the content of the episode as you yourself said  it was there to further shock us no they didnt have guys with guitars jump out of the trees and actually play during the scene but it was the next worst thing they added the music to help us feel jaimes shock and pain when we didnt need any help  the dialogue acting and directing of that final scene did it perfectly instead it took us out of the show and ruined the suspension of disbelief by saying look how shocking this is the whole thing reminded me of how true blood end their episodes  bloody death  followed by credits withhey its a happy folk song cause were not taking anything seriouslyget it please dd  no more funnyshockingcuteironic anachronistic songs edited by winterisalwayscoming 16 april 2013  0107 am"

"insertname",2013-04-16,"nopeyessee what i did thereseriously the argument that its only the credits so it has nothing to do with the episode is stupid that would only make sense if the episode stopped right at the end and you could manually watch the credits but obviously they roll on right after the end of the scene so yes it has a very clear connection and it was really jarring that was of course the intent of the whole thing  its just that people either liked it or hated it the simple fact that so many people are writing about this shows that its not just a song that plays in the credits and has nothing to do with the episode personally it didnt work at all for me and pulled down the jaime scene but i can see why they did it just hope they wont do it again"

"Holy Sock",2013-04-16,"so as we know hoster tullys funeral is a lot less comical in the book and theres a very sweet moment between the blackfish and edmure it would have been nice to see this moment play out but its clear why they went with the more comical road i think this moment between the blackfish and edmure would only really have worked if wed been introduced to the two characters earlier because we werent this scene has to establish their characters immediately which it does very well we clearly see edmures incompetence and his brash actions in war and the show firmly establishes the blackfishs abilities and his gruff yet wise demeanour it would also have been a strange transition from a sombre scene with edmure  brynden to an antagonistic one with robb it works very well with the small council chair scene establishing characters in a completely silent yet comical way i do hope however that before the red wedding we get to see a bit more of edmures sympathetic side it would be a shame to simply have the character be the unlikeable black mark of the heroes"

"StarkTagaryen",2013-04-15,"true though i liked the bear and the maiden fair more in the rendition of lockes men singing smilepng classbbcemoticon alt yeah their rendition sounded more authentic for the word like the rains of castamere did but the end version was too much of a rock ballad and it didnt fit in with the showthey should release both renditions of the song"
"Mediumjon Umber",2013-04-15,"the end credits really left a shitty taste in my mouth why did we have to have that lame poppy version it doesnt fit with anything in the last 22 episodes of the show will the closing credits next week be from lady gaga that was like putting a turd on top of an ice cream sundaei pray to the old gods and the new that they wont start doing montages with crappy contemporary songs towards the end of some episodes"
"Lady Octarina",2013-04-15,"i loved the ending i was so completely shocked at that scene even knowing what was coming but i think i was even more shocked at the bear and the maiden fair at the credits i was slightly angry because i wanted to feel jaimes pain like in the book i wanted to be overwhelmed by feelings that would be only made worse by a depressing song and they give us that at the same time it was so completely absurd that i couldnt stop laughing for ten minutes really brilliant so i understand why many people hated that transition but i cant bring myself to be that disappointed"
"DragonsHungry",2013-04-15,"that was an awesome transition the song is supposed to evoke that emotion its horrifying and jarring but i couldnt stop laughing either there were so many comedic elements subtly and overtly in this episode that was how it should have ended i really like locke how he was condescending to jaime your lordship and the whole setup to that scene as to his motivation its simple jaime is a a lannister as far as a locke is concerned they are still the enemy until told otherwise i am liking the fact it shows that northmen arent all ned stark type guys the boltons have a nasty side edited by dragonshungry 15 april 2013  0818 am"

"DragonsHungry",2013-04-15,"background music is to enhance the mood and help tell the story i am not saying they should do that often but in this instance that song had me pumped which is exactly the emotion you get off that awesome final scene there were black comedic themes this whole episode so it wasnt really out of place it was very true blood a nod to hbo subcribers which was okay to do in that shocking moment i hope that song is released on itunes that is going on my ipod edited by dragonshungry 15 april 2013  0904 am"

"polarbear",2013-04-15,"i am curious why so many fans felt the bear and the maiden fair didnt fit with the end of the episode was it the tempo of the music hard and fast songs arent a modern invention they sang em loud in the middle ages too was it the instrumentation most of the orchestral score is performed on synthesizers and classical orchestral instruments pianos clarinets french horns in fact drums and guitars might be more accurate to the fauxmedieval time period of got than most of the music weve heard on the show so far"
"White Harbors Wrath",2013-04-15,"most likely because people are generally sticks in the mud and need something to talkbitch about on forums i personally liked the song and how it was like a kick to the stomach after we were already down it was a complete adrenaline rush even after the chop having some ambient thoughtful string interlude wouldnt have warranted a second thoughtand wouldve been kind of a letdown after that moment now thousands of people are talking about itsounds like it garnered more emotion than any of the other closing songshmmm"

"Demonblade",2013-04-15,"the gf who hasnt read the series thought it was hilarious i thought it seemed out of place but since it was at the endcredits it didnt bother me all that much i thought the music added to the general ambivalence surrounding jaime at this point because he is still very much a villain who threw bran off the ledge and deserved some form of payback at least in the eyes of his captors on the one hand seeing an important guy from the other side get harmed does afford some callous mirth but on the other hand we just saw a guy who at this point in the story is not all that bad get his hand cut off in a visceral fashion the audience should be left not knowing what to think about this incident and the music helped with that apprehension"

"Harrad",2013-04-15,"when i said a little mistakeit was dramatic irony clothed in wry wit i would think the rw would have more of an impact on tv because robb is a pov character on tv whereas he was largely offscreen in the book further there is so much foreshadowing of it on tv that the most naive watcher has to feel that something is up"

"lostinwesteros",2013-04-15," harrad  15glad you went back to clarify your assessment of robbs marriage as a huge mistake i see that as one of the most enormous mistakes in the first few books tantamount to neds telling cercei he knows about the twincest and come to think of it id have to include sansas running to cercei when ned announced they were going back to winterfell as another huge mistake as well as a betrayal of her father but im getting off track robb hasnt been one of my very favorite characters in the book or the series except that i really admired his battle strategy in that first major confrontation with tywin et al its not that i havent liked him but i dont think his has deserved as much attention as its gotten in the tv series that said the rw was such a shocker that its hard to find words for it it was more of a shocker than neds beheading cause we could see that coming but the rw was a total surprise i too have really been missing grey windwhere has he been in fact all of the direwolves have been disappointedly absent of late anyway yes  from what i understand the rw will take place in the final episode this year good thread"

"Cas Stark",2013-04-15,"the book plot was equally stupid and implausible imo as if a king would ever marry for such a reason during a war hes losingit was implausible but compared to the tv plot line it was much more realistic have an adult robb marry an adult talisa with no ties to westeros at all just because when there is no reason on earth why they couldnt continue an affair is crazy much more crazy than a teenager all alone without his mothers counselunlike show robb who gets her advice and disregards itdoing something in the heat of the moment"
"The Fourth Head",2013-04-15,"i would be interested to know if nonbook readers find robbs decision so hard to fathom or indeed talisa so irritatingthe rw casts such a big shadowits important to note the conflict within robbs heart once he realised he was no longer fighting for his fathers life honour and freedom when joffrey beheaded ned in one fell stroke he poisoned robbs cause he was left with nothing more to fight for than bloodrevenge his kingship which he didnt ask for and peer pressure none of which are as virtuous a cause as selflessly fighting to save a living person and that persons honour talisa and cat did a good job of guilttripping him for that in season 2 and reminding him that the only virtue left in their cause was the rescuing of his sisters not ending his blood feud with the lannisters indeed throughout the books the entire stark mo has been about saving people not killing them out of revengekarstark spelled out this shift in their cause in stark words in season 3 episode 2 aye i have faith in your cause if your cause is revenge that is not what robb set out in the first place for his cause has become warped commandeered and turned around to the extent that he will end up looking like a hypocrite for killing karstarki say all this because during season 2 talisa starts challenging his motives is he killing solidiers he has no issues with personally for the justice of a dead man he started to change tack and become willing to negotiate with the lannisters to spare joffreys head leave the lannisters in kl and go home which is what he stressed to talisa on the battelfield i want to go home in short robb was losing faith in his cause the whole war had become subverted to the point that it was shaming him a war that has left him actively punishing his mother for trying to save his sisters and for what so in the end for a moment he sold out on his cause he succumbed to the seductions of littlemiss embodiment of virtue talisa because that felt right and this war no longer didimo talisa did a good job of seducing him im willing to bet nonbook readers like talisa lets not forget as a person of desire she has a lot more going for her as a beautiful florence nightingale cliche than jeyne westerling ever did im not saying im sold on her the timing in season 2 was a hatchet job if you can be irresponsible so can i but in terms of a salvage job i think the best thing the writers can do at this point is portray talisa as a woman worth losing a kingdom over show her advising robb supporting robb emotionally making robb happy hell even have her showing some savvy and suggesting to robb how he can make amends with the freys that would add a whole new layer to the character so long as it was done subtly and never made clear with hindsight whether it was an innocent suggestion or not we cant have robb looking more foolishconversely we only see robb these days marching around looking moody and angry scenes with talisa opening up to her taking off his kingface showing his vulnerabilities his fears for his brothers his hopes for a future together with her back at winterfell this is all needed in the build up to sell the idea that he died for true love and that he was a 3d character worth mourning overbook robb cried in the dark to bran over his mum leaving him in charge a touch of family sentimentality would be true to the character even though offpiste sentimentality is heavily scorned around here edited by the fourth head 15 april 2013  0134 pm"

"Newstar",2013-04-14,"eta unless maybe its being added so that shae will find out and be enragedthen later tyrionsansa further enraging shaeall leading to her testimony vs tyrion down the linei think the brothel scene references pod losing his virginity as speculated as for tyrion i think there will be a moment similar to in acok when a prostitute invites tyrion to partake and he has no interest realizing that shae is the only one he wants doesnt mean that shae wont hit the roof when she finds out he was at a brothel but i think my scenario is more likely edited by newstar 14 april 2013  0231 pm"
"TheDarkOne",2013-04-14,"the sex scene is there as a way to keep the neanderthals watching the show who like it but never understand the stories they watch for the big moments and boobs dd cater to this segment of the audience constantly it does absolutely nothing for the story"
"King Tommen",2013-04-14,"i hardly think people watch shows like this specifically for boobs since it would be much easier to get your fix with the multiple avenues available to all to watch porn its hbo thats what they do i never heard this kind of pissing and moaning when the sopranos had scenes take place at the bada bing just so we could have naked strippers writhing on poles in the background of the scene it really didnt do anything for the story either but i didnt have to hear fans of the show get their panties in a bunch constantly about it"

"Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl",2013-04-14,"stannis is not a borg or vulcan he is quite capable of emotion anger etc in the books if anything theyve toned it down on the show he has been lost to despair after blackwater and i would argue suffering from ptsd given dillanes performance he is broken and literally clinging to one of his advisorsthat has been set up from the beginning as his lover he clearly derives some level of emotional support no point debating show vsbook as i see two of them as different canons however i failt to see how it is out of character for the showi agree"

"Head of The Ned",2013-04-04,"theon jamie and cersei will have that conversation with tywin about her needing to be remarried"
"Tony Soprano",2013-04-06,"i think were finally going to see ramsays reveal and of course theon getting tortured we could also see tywin trying to calm things down in kings landing by disciplining cersei and joffrey i think its too early for jaimes dismemberment though i think well get that in episode 4"
"Kasrith",2013-04-06,"definitely 3 and 6 still cant wrap my mind around the title keep thinking about cerseis walk of shameobviously this but id figure it has to do with jaime he is seen walking around shorthanded in one of the pre season trailers"
"Hellfell",2013-04-06,"so how do you think jaime will get his hand chopped off id really like to see him trying to escape yes again fighting and killing several lockes men but then he is surrounded knocked down and locke slices his sword hand off it would be the last fight for jaime in all his glory"

"Words of Winter",2013-04-07,"could this mean the nw march toward crasters place and the punishing walk for jon snow being attacked by the eagle i could see dd making either of these a death march of sorts"

"Rhaegarsjoy",2013-04-08,"i think they know theres too many ppl who read the books and be able to know exactly what will happen just from the title so they jumble it up sometimes to prevent spoilers walk of punishment my first thought was cerceis walk but obviously thats too soon valar dohaeris i thought would suite better for arya catching the ship to braavos thats what the captain says back to her maybe cercei tells tywin about ros n he wips her n make her do the walk of shame but more likely its theon getting punished for scaping the same way he wanted to punish the stark kids for scaping him"

"Hodors Shlong",2013-04-08,"since the preview showed theon escaping via help from boy i wager most of his screen time will be him getting chased down by bolton men and boy with the more intense torture to come can definitley see scenes between tywin cercei or tywin cercei tyrion and joff id bet that jaimie getting his hand lopped off will be the last scene"
