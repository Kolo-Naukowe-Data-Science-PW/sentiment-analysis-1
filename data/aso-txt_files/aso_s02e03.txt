"Ran",2012-04-15,"book spoiler discussion of the show goes here for those who want to discuss the episode in relation to the books and with reference to spoilers from them this topic should open automatically around the start of airing"
"Boar Hunter",2012-04-15,"i cant recall when and exactly why craster did tell the watch to get out of his keep obviously it wasnt because jon followed him into the woods to give a male baby to an other"
"Boar Hunter",2012-04-15,"on another note i cant wait to see the armor of renlys men and just how ugly this brienne is really going to be"
"Boar Hunter",2012-04-15,"3 posts in a rowapologies but sir loras just said that margery was a virgin officially implying she may not be bro sis incest with her bisexual brother it could also just be a line included for viewers since the actress playing her is in her early twenties however i dont think that bodes well for her and her impending trial with the faith presumably at the beginning of winds of winter i do believe that her trial will not go the way we are supposed to expect it will and her execution will set off a firestorm of violence from the tyrells finally"
"Ice Turtle",2012-04-15,"don t feel sorry im rather interested in whats going on but i have to wait so im happy for anything anyone want to share"
"Ser Hippie",2012-04-15,"so lf is sent to renly to negotiate with catelyn apparently based on tyrions comments and the pictures weve already seen showing them together not sure if that works logistically but could be pretty interesting i really liked tonights episode i wish the battle between lorch and the nights watch had been a little less lowkey since its one of my favorite scenes in the book and yoren one of my favorite characters but i think it was handled pretty well unsurprisingly theyre cutting some of the unnecessary arya bits between that battle and harrenhal presumably theyll have gregor and his gang torture some people there for aryas prayer to come to be"
"Mark Antony",2012-04-15,"great episode only thing i didnt like was shaesansa"
"dtones520",2012-04-15,"peter dinklage is so incredible as tyrion when i read the books now all i can picture is him as tyrion"
"Ser Joe of House Targaryen",2012-04-15,"wow they really condensed a lot into one episode loved every minute of it though i also wish the battle with yoren and ser amorys men had been more like the scene in the book but oh well myabe well get lucky and some other scene will have maisie screaming winterfell lol overall i thought this was a great episode waiting for next sunday is going to suuuuuuuuuuuuuuck"
"ckal",2012-04-15,"only things i didnt like where the renlylorasmargeary and sansashae scenes everything else was really great probably the best episode so far this season"
"Jack's Smirking Revenge",2012-04-15,"i have to say that the budget restraints sometimes bother me i liked the scene between yoren and arya but i woiuld have liked that they showed that the men fought the lannisters plus arya gendry and hot pie kind of shine in that moment the craster scene was kind of strange i was surprised that mormont was so accepting of the fact that craster gives his sons to the others maisie was great in this episode sophia did a pretty good jobi liked the renly stuff though im a little questioning about margarey idk there was a lot of tyrion in this episode i could do with less however the guy who plays varys nails it everytime hes on screen shae is a waste i loved the bran scenes"
"Fez",2012-04-15,"great episode i liked it a lot more than last week i was kinda hoping this would be the episode dany met with the envoys from qarth but there really wouldnt have been enough screen time for that im really liking the greyjoys far more than i ever liked theons chapters preadwd which i always considered a drag"
"The Nerdly Knight",2012-04-15,"excellent episode and my favorite of the season so far yoren really stole the show with his bravery though i was disappointed they didnt let arya and the recruits work out there exploration bit other than that the bit between renly and margaery in his chambers was perfect as was theons explosive anger at balon i will say though the shae and sansa bit threw me off as is littlefinger going to do the negotiations i guess well have to see how it all plays out over the next few episodes"
"Lord Godric",2012-04-15,"there were two very strong parts of this episode the entire renly section starting with brienne dominating loras and ending with them effectively showing why they aged up margaery and that is to make her a plotting bamf and then tyrions threefold scene with pycelle varys and littlefinger was executed so greatly"
"Ramsay Gimp",2012-04-15,"the scene with tyrion manipulating the other council members was shot beautifully"
"Dornish Hen",2012-04-15,"alas poor yoren we loved you well even with the few changes from the book the episode was great although why didnt they introduce damphair as his uncle is it not supposed to be damphair other than that i thought it was well done edited by dornish hen 15 april 2012  0906 pm"
"Lord Godric",2012-04-15,"way to much homoism its unattractive and not a very important part of the showoh shut up its in the books and its hypocritical to not bitch about heteroism"
"dtones520",2012-04-15,"way to much homoism its unattractive and not a very important part of the show its important to build renly as a character to show a rather arrogant man in all other aspects of being a king but his duty to provide an heir he cannot do because of his sexuality"
"Jack's Smirking Revenge",2012-04-15,"that said i like alphie as theon though i donot like gemma whelan as asha shes very blah in the way that he delivers dialogue asha has a lot of charisma itd be nice if they didnt change that part of her personality also i dont know why they keep making cersei so likeable"
"legba11",2012-04-15,"excellent excellent tight storytelling very little wasted space in this episode i wonder how many purist heads exploded when they read theons letter this was as good as last weeks without the excessive hboness dragging it down"
"Trebla",2012-04-15,"another strong episode cant wait for the full brienne should be uglier rage tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp  to me its no different than the tyrion is too handsome stuff in this show tyrions problems are that he is a dwarf him being ugly as well isnt necessary brienne is tall huge and a woman thats more than enough negatives alas for yoren loved his backstory was interesting to see how the writers simplified some storylines shae working for sansa and arya immeditately being caught by the lannisters makes sense for a 10 episode season im gonna miss renly just when he was becoming more interesting"
"ckal",2012-04-15,"and yes they really did condense a lot into this episode which made sense it is setting up things quicker and will allow the show to spend more time in other areas"
"The Nerdly Knight",2012-04-15,"the craster scene was kind of strange i was surprised that mormont was so accepting of the fact that craster gives his sons to the otherskeep in mind he has the same attitude in the book where they are the laws are different in fact craster has no law to bend to beyond the wall that would match what those men were use to by doing something about his actions they would have lost an ally who had always provided food and shelter to the nights watch as well as potentially caused a host of other ethical and legal issues as well edited by the nerdly knight 15 april 2012  0903 pm"
"Megara",2012-04-15,"great episode only thing i didnt like was shaesansai hated that scene i really think sansa was way too out of character 7 "
"Mya Stone",2012-04-15,"way to much homoism its unattractive and not a very important part of the showseriously you realize you dont have to type everything the little homophobic voice in your head tells you to right i loved this episode thought it greatly improved on the first 2 of the season not one wasted scene liked how they condensed shaes arc from bouncing from brothel to lollys to sansa loved how sansas hair was exactly like cerseis thought it was a nice touch also loved lenas rage at myrcella being sent away finally seeing shades of book cersei ill have more to add after i watch it again tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp "
"Boar Hunter",2012-04-15,"i keep seeing people say the scene between sansa and shae was no good but if you think about it they are really just staying true to the book and the crap that was that chapter pwnd hahaha"

"Jack's Smirking Revenge",2012-04-15,"way to much homoism its unattractive and not a very important part of the showi liked that scene i liked loras for the first time in this episode i think its important to establish margarey and loras for the benefit of future seasonsalso all they did was kissi mean you didnt see renly give him a bjalso unattractive also it explains the actions of loras in future seasons"

"Ser Joe of House Targaryen",2012-04-15,"i agree about tv shae not sure if its the writing or the actress but she is far less interesting on the show than she is in the book i wish theyd fix that"

"Boar Hunter",2012-04-15,"its important to build renly as a character to show a rather arrogant man in all other aspects of being a king but his duty to provide an heir he cannot do because of his sexualityinterestingly to readers margery acknowledges renly and loras relationship and is more than okay with renly getting his nut in whatever way he has toshe is so much older in the show that it really changes the sexual dynamic that is so important to her story"
"redraike",2012-04-15,"i liked the part where will smith punches the alien in the face and says welcome to earth oh wait wrong forum"
"Ramsay Gimp",2012-04-15,"i wonder how many purist heads exploded when they read theons letteri liked that part theons arrogancecockiness seems to be toned down a bit for the showthough some of ashas cruel remarks toward him seem forced"
"Lord Godric",2012-04-15,"im gonna miss renly just when he was becoming more interestingsame here the show has fleshed out his character more than the books did and just as he becomes a character worth getting behind hes gonna die i think his death will be more heartbreaking on the show than it was in the books"
"Josephxoxo",2012-04-15,"its in the books and its hypocritical to not bitch about heteroismthey could have displayed the same thing without all the making out it was so unneccessary i dont bitch about heteroism because every scene in the show so far displayed a purpose jaime and cersei in the tower for example"
"Lany Cassandra",2012-04-15,"great episode loved every minute of it i like how they have streamlined shaes story line we really dont need lorrysbronn can marry someone who has not been scene onscreenher nametitle is what matters"

"Bran the Bummer",2012-04-15,"way to much homoism its unattractive and not a very important part of the showwow not even sure where to begin i admit i am curious why the use of homoism either you mean deference to gay people which is certainly ridiculous because weve seen more breeding and inbreeding than is really important without seeing so much as a bare backside from loras or renly or you mean homosexuality generally though you feel some need to demean gay people in the process as others have already pointed out its important to show how different renlys relationship with loras and margaery were and how it affected his decisions if anything is unattractive here its your base opinion"
"ckal",2012-04-15,"trebla that renly scene wasnt bad but i just am not a big fan of it i realize hbo has to make people care about renly more than what the book explicitly gives and this is the way they are doing it i think it is smart to make him a complex character with weaknesses based on how they have been portraying him but i feel this could have been avoided if they just made him the lovable renly from the books that we all know people would get attached to him just because of his personality but in the show he is a complete 180 so they need to do something to make him more interesting jacks smirking revenge im with you about loras i actually liked him this episode a good deal they did a fine job with his character here"
"Tsavong Lah",2012-04-15,"i really enjoyed the renly and margaery scene i think it sets up her character in a great way showing that she really understands the game tyrion and the small council members was great as well not sure i have much in the way of complaints some things were definitely changed due to budget which while frustrating are also understandable"
"Lord Godric",2012-04-15,"they could have displayed the same thing without all the making out it was so unneccessary i dont bitch about heteroism because every scene in the show so far displayed a purpose jaime and cersei in the tower for examplenow that is hilarious got is known for unnecessary gratuitous sex and this wasnt even sex it was kissing it was much more necessary to the story than any sex weve seen with roz or even theon to date get over your homophobia"

"Trebla",2012-04-15,"mod lets be very clear here homophobia is not tolerated on this board consider this a warningmod"
"Lord Godric",2012-04-15,"i really enjoyed the renly and margaery scene i think it sets up her character in a great way showing that she really understands the gamei agree and while i always stood behind the natalie dormer casting decision i think this episode showed why it will be much more beneficial to have someone older who can fight against cersei in later seasons"
"NW Deserter",2012-04-15,"best episode of the season by far i loved the editing of tyrions meeting with the council members and then him capturing pycelle was awesome i think my favorite little change was yoren giving his backstory and introducing the idea of a nightly prayer to arya great way to condense the storytelling a bit next week looks to be full of iconic book scenes the peach the shadowbaby joffrey abusing sansa ser gregor punishing his prisonersgonna be awesome"
"Ran",2012-04-15,"ive no problem with theons letter even on a purist front days maybe weeks pass between theons two chapters and nothing says he didnt go from that first meeting with his father pondering whether to warn robb obviously theyve adjusted the timing but anyways no issue not least because its a brilliantly executed sequence the only thing that would have improved it is if theon did the hardcore drowning ceremony not just the baptismal thing that passes for it these days to prove himself that would have been amazing to have on the screen"
"ckal",2012-04-15,"maester lewin and bran scenes are gold tyrion and the council scenes were gold tyrioncersei was gold the greyjoys scene was gold nights watch scene was gold renlys tournament scene was gold loooooot of great stuff here in this episode"

"Lord Godric",2012-04-15,"i dont know i just find tv shae completely uninterestingi dont find her uninteresting exactly but i feel like they have something planned for her that we just dont know about yet her whole mysterious backstory and now shes taking handmaid lessons from sansa  they definitely seem to be setting her up to be someone who is used to being on the other side of that situation i really do think she is supposed to be some highborn lady from somewhere  and her scene with sansa definitely added to that"

"Mr. E",2012-04-15,"i agree with some of the others on here that tyrions plotting scene with pycelle varys and littlefinger was probably the best things done this season i really like the way they cut it as well it actually took me a second to figure out what they were doing and then i was like whoa dude nice camerawork i also think the writers and alfie allen are doing a great job selling theons turn i thought the books did a decent job of it but only decent and even that wouldnt have flown in a visual medium but alfies face and mannerisms really sell it"
"congokong",2012-04-15,"not sure why they rushed the whole thing with shae in the red keep and a lot of screen time was wasted on it her character is so rude too for a whore even a married woman in that culture wouldnt behave like she did i hear people have drinking games that they take a drink whenever a character dies instead they should take shots whenever the show diverges from the book everyone will be on the floor by episodes end edited by congokong 15 april 2012  0919 pm"

"Atreides",2012-04-15,"about ashayara i thought she was mediocre not great but not terrible im hoping she gets better at the role as the show progresses and begins to really show her charisma and fighting attitude that make her so popular among the ironborn and readersviewers she smirks and jokes in the show but its just way too subtle"
"Bran the Bummer",2012-04-15,"marges tiddies werent very big but they sure were nice she offered to tag team renly with lorasthats what you call a trooperor creepy but this is westeros so well call her a trooper i am going to enjoy seeing the curtain pulled back with marge considering shes so hard to read in the booksi think it helped to show how far families go to show their loyalty to each other and to their friends tyrells and all we dont get to see much of margaerys machinations in the books but its clear she has an active hand in things later on she would rather have influenced renly through loras than to sit by meekly all that was important to her was being a queen to glorify her house and to give the true king a child and who better to help her accomplish this than her blood"
"Ser Hippie",2012-04-15,"im a book reader who while not quite liking tv shae at least thinks shes more interesting than book shae where i spent most of the time facepalming at tyrion"
"lostinwesteros",2012-04-15,"the episodes are so short i wanted much more of arya and the guys with yoren defending that fortthing the way they did in the book and what somebody else mentioned  arya crying winterfell and i so hated to see yoren go but tonight i did see the redwhite divide of jaqens hair i really hate shae just hate her interesting what was said about margaery reportedly being a virgin too much of renlylorasmargaery considering all the other parts that were cut or hurried over and we all know renly is getting ready to be killed love to see how tyrion outwits the other players in kl loved brienne  have been waiting for her and loved the scene where we saw brienne tower over catelyn thought theon played his part tonight really well  i empathized with him something i didnt think id ever say until he got to be spoiler reek mormonts scene was excellent glad jon got his sword back"
"JonHo",2012-04-15,"i bet the scene between loras and renly wouldnt be gratuitious if it was between a man and a woman fandom so predictable"
"White Harbors Wrath",2012-04-15,"why bring got im only talking about this episode it was a good episode except for that and sansas scene with shae shaes a pretty bad actor by the way and a very uniteresting chatacter in the tv show youre probably going to demean me for that toactuallyyou specifically mentioned jaime and cerseiwhich happened in episode one youre just wrongits not even opinion 90 of the scenes with ros have served almost no purpose whatsoever and theyve been pretty damn hetero"
"End of Disc One",2012-04-15,"i think this shae has the potentital to make the story more heartbreaking shae in the book was an obvious whore who said whatever a man wants to hear if this more honest shae can appear to actually fall for tyrion then that would be as i said heartbreaking"
"Nu Valyr",2012-04-15,"definitely my favorite episode of the season i hated theon in the books and i wasnt a fan in season 1 but he grew on me a lot this episode same thing with yoren i didnt particularly care for him but i was really sad to see him go after his monologue it was great i had the opposite experience with yara i loved her in the books but i think the actress portraying her is maybe trying too hard her bravado just doesnt seem natural and that was my favorite thing about yaraasha brienne  â<U+0099> btw it looks like they are building renlys character up for a longer story arc the previews kinda implied that they skip over the tent scene in the books i dont mind but its interesting i think they are taking more liberties with this season cant wait for episode 4 edited by nu valyr 15 april 2012  0951 pm"

"Triskan",2012-04-15,"ive no problem with theons letter even on a purist front days maybe weeks pass between theons two chapters and nothing says he didnt go from that first meeting with his father pondering whether to warn robb obviously theyve adjusted the timing but anyways no issue not least because its a brilliantly executed sequence the only thing that would have improved it is if theon did the hardcore drowning ceremony not just the baptismal thing that passes for it these days to prove himself that would have been amazing to have on the screenyeah  i havent read anything that comes after this in the thread yet but i thought theons letter burning was a great example of a nonsourcematerial piece that worked he does attack winterfell after all to the jackass everyone knows who im talking about at this point please understand that you are doesnt get it guy as such you will continue to not get that you dont get it great episode overall easily my favorite of the first few of this season now may i say one thing in defense of renly sometimes it really is the wine"
"teemo",2012-04-15,"any complaints about the scene with loras and renly are just ridiculous they werent even nude or having sex and even if they were so what geez loved how they did the tyrells and renly triangle i found it interesting how they said margaery was officially a maiden she sure strutted in there like she knew what she was doing threesome with two male lovers and a girl thats one of the lovers sister awwkkkwarrd loved how margaery was so cool with it that was exactly what i always expected her to be like and someone said margaery had small breasts well she did in the book too didnt mind the cerseisansatommenmyrcella scene too much it was another example of how sweet joffs siblings are and helps viewers remind them who they are considering that myrcella is about to be shipped off still disappointed with asha i said i would give her another chance but there was just no spunk or fire at all i think she needs to smirk and smile a bit more she says taunting things but her expressions and attitude dont back them up oh and asha is not supposed to be hot get over it and who cares is theon was attracted to her theon would fuck anything with a pulse to put it bluntly wow talk about a shaefast forward i am hating this tyrionshae relationship it just felt really awkward and like the writing was off you wouldnt even guess that they have sex very often when thats all they really did in the books and i dont think there are many whores who treat their nobile boyfriend or whatever like total crap she is so rude and crude i dont get it and shae may be the worst casting decision so far she is a terrible actress yay no ros and the scene between sansa and shae i just didnt freakin get that at all also another awkwardly written scene sansa was just never a brat in the book why do they make her so bratty in the show did balon say he planned on taking winterfell if so that doesnt make any sense he never had any desire to overtake winterfell that was theons independent idea that just highlighted his treachery to both of his families dont really like that if i heard balon correctly i do they think they keep trying to make cersei likable and i just dont get it she is a psychopath with the way she behaves in affc how can she possibly be turned into a more sympathetic character she definitely suffers from narcissistic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder if you ask me the scene with tyrion testing the different council members was beautifully done didnt think they had time but they did it just perfect brienne was absolutely perfect my boyfriend has no idea how ugly she was supposed to be so i asked her okay  is she too pretty to be described as someone quite hideous and wanted an honest answer he thought she definitely was not pretty at all he was surprised that she used to be very girly and feminine she was just awesome i know how hard she prepped for this part and i think she nailed it is something up with petyrs accent he is sounding so much different from last season  i miss the reeddssss sadpng classbbcemoticon alt  loved hodors greeting in brans wolf dream and the wolf dream itself too summer looks awesome i was a little confused with them rushing through the gold cloaksmountains teams storylines but im kind of glad they did because im just dying to see the tickler and the mountain and the messed up stuff that they do im curious if theyll be as brutal in the show as they are in the book and id like to see how he does his tickling since we never really knew for sure edited by dannister 15 april 2012  0947 pm"

"Mack Kilimaro",2012-04-15,"i like how they managed to fit in the whole tyrion casting a long shadow imagei just wanted to highlight this comment because its something that made me smile about the episode too one of the things that i think is great about the book with tyrion is that you get that image so soon after you meet him it was a nice nod to put it in there even if it didnt make it into his earliest scenes"
"7V3N",2012-04-15,"i really disliked the first two episodes but this one made up for it it portrayed the book perfectly not word for word or exact scenes but by the moods attitudes and meanings i am not sure why lf is going to see cat but it cant be all that bad i am just happy we didnt have to suffer many fetish scenes minor with loras margaerys was mixed in with some good story info the tyrion scenes were excellent as always i am unsure why they are expanding shaes role possibly to make her betrayal more emotional for the audience but it is good for showing tyrions character i am really looking forward to next episode which i havent done since before the season premiere btw i am still waiting to hear giant of lannister edited by the shadow fox 15 april 2012  0948 pm"

"MegasAV",2012-04-15,"agree by far best episode of this season brilliant casting of brienne as that is almost exactly as i pictured her i also believe tonights episode was the closest of the first three in matching dialogue from book of the variations that they changed from the book most made sense a la tyrion theorizing to wed myrcella to theon and using these lies to snuff out his traitor on the small council loved the theon scene burning the letter warning robb truly showed his internal conflict and alphie allens facial expressions really showed his turmoil only thing i didnt like was shaes demeanor as sansas handmaiden was completely unrealistic and theons sister was just a horrible miscast"
"Lady Octarina",2012-04-15,"no dragonstone bawlgif classbbcemoticon altbawl  but well i did enjoy the episode yorens death was just as painful as in the book and considerably more shocking catelyns criticism of renly and his playmates did make me like the character a bit more tyrions deception couldnt have been shown in a better way and cerseis reaction to tyrions plans to myrcella was one of those great acting moments lena headey has had more frequently than ever this season brienne was simply perfect entirely worth the wait i did like renly and loras scene it was convincing and honestly two men kissing is a good change from the frequent two prostitutes rehearsing also margaerys behavior just proves what many had speculated that she knew about them and that loras might have been a part of their uh babymaking process the pyke scene captured theons drama in a very competent wayand alfie allen was amazing yara scares me but i assume ill get used to her and her name eventually"

"Mya Stone",2012-04-15,"and the scene between sansa and shae i just didnt freakin get that at all also another awkwardly written scene sansa was just never a brat in the book why do they make her so bratty in the show my take on that is this the previous scene had just shown sansa to have absolutely zero control at dinner with cersei the second she is given a new hand maiden she exerts her control and power and yes brattiness she is just a kid over her i liked the juxtaposition"

as others have discussed the books wrote a part of theon the novels make the good arguer in all of us beg theon to just say what is so obvious â<U+0080><U+009C>lord father why do you hate me do much for being a hostage to eddard stark when i was a hostage to pay for your â<U+0080> buffooneryâ<U+0080><U+009D> we go through a whole book with the reader asking that open and obvious question one that never leaves theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s lips and then tonight it all came rushing out in a torrent theon greyjoy finally at long last speaks not the pissy halfmeasures as it was in the books but that honest and true message â<U+0080><U+009C>why do you hate me for being a reminder of your mistakeâ<U+0080><U+009D> finally at long last theon sounds like a person who can think and feel straight and i loved that in the middle of that tirade that close shot of balon greyjoy and in that fucking actor was pure brilliance he almostâ<U+0080> just almost â<U+0080> looks like he empathizes with theon as if heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s about to â<U+0080> be an honest man and not a shitty shitty and i cannot stress this enough shitty lord that may have been the shot of the series staring into the deep darkness of balon greyjoyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s painwracked eyes tyrion lannister 123 its my favorite chapter in the cok the scene where tyrion plans the lies and gets three men to dance to his tune lf varys and

and others â<U+0080> others are ned stark the queen in the south her brother and their husband i really donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know what others are complaining about but the renly scenes are absolutely fantastic because they are the maergery tyrell scenes which is why they shine while renly tries to play king and loras tries to get him to play lover the queen is not at all fooled nope no no she wants an heir she wants a chance to roll the dice in the game of thrones and the only way to do that is through the graces of renly baratheon and if that takes loras to jump in to start or do them both or to have him take her from behind so he can pretend its loras she is going to do all that she is nobodyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s fool she is in it to win it and so she tells renly flat out whatever it takes stannis thinks the same wayâ<U+0080>honorable mention thank you for not keeping the lame joke that it was a â<U+0080><U+009C>rainbow guardâ<U+0080><U+009D> yes we get it heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s gay

"Howdyphillip",2012-04-15,"here is my biggest complaint about this episode the opening sequence showed dragonstone and the dothraki wasteland and we didnt go there i thought that each opening was tailor made to reflect the locations that we would visit in that episode other than that this episode was just about perfect the best actor in the show turns out to be a twelve year old girl my god miasie was phenomenal again tonight someone should nominate her for an emmy this year peter motherfg dinkledge was outstanding as well all of the tyrion scenes were not only brilliantly written but superbly delivered as well gwendolyn christie is brienne as that character is one of my largest book crushes i cant wait until she meets me in real life and falls madly and passionately in love with me all of the greyjoys rock even asha who is growing on me by leaps and bounds that leaves me with the two controversies that we have been discussing here the first is renlyloras i am heterosexual as well and i am not turned on by a scene in which two men act in a sexual manner with one another that said i am also an adult and just because i am not inclined to be aroused by it doesnt mean that i cant watch it and enjoy it specifically when it is in perfect context with what the author wrote about his characters both characters did a wonderful job of acting in this scene and it set up perfectly the later conflict between loras and brienne it also gave us an understanding of the maidenhood of margery which will become an essential plot point as the story goes this scene was absolutely necessary to advance the plot of the tv show and if you are too immature to watch then switch the damn channel for two minutes and dont burden the rest of us with your homophobia that leaves me with shae she is a completely different character in this show the problem that i have had is that i keep trying to reconcile her to the shae of the books well five episodes into her story arc this is obviously not the case tonight i tried to keep an open mind with the actress and just judge her on her performance she is actually doing a fantastic job it is obvious to me that her direction is to be arrogant and a bit unlikeable i think that dd is doing this because they were afraid they couldnt redeem the character of tyrion after he kills her to a tv audience i personally think that they could but it would be extremely tricky i dont begrudge them at all for going the easier route on this one"

"Eponine",2012-04-15,"loved tyrions test of pycellevaryslf  easily my favorite part of the episode loved brienne  i think the show will greatly benefit from having her story arc being viewed instead of told because shes already more fascinating to watch then she was to read about the same goes for sam who i enjoy much more in the show than in the books loved sam and gilly i appreciate the pov structure in the book but sometimes the characters get so fixated loved when sansa said she hoped the fighting was over soon so she could declare her love of the king shouldnt cersei sympathize devilgif classbbcemoticon altdevil   undecided about yara although i totally want that greyjoy kraken fireplace shes described as witty not extremely charismatic so itll boil down for me to whether she seems convincing when shes with the ships renly was greatly improved from last season although i still feel like hes missing something margaery was great but loras ugh thats all its not because hes gay its because hes unattractive hey being beautiful and strong albeit skinny is an important part of who he is in the book and whiny and silly totally outmatched by his sister hated shae there are a lot of possible ways her character could have gone that would be better than this the whole mysterious foreigner not lowborn thing annoys the shit out of me  instead of being an opportunistic prostitute in a very precarious position shes attaching herself to tyrion for unknown reasons what i really dont like is that this shae doesnt seem to draw tyrion in at all shes not sexy shes physically beautiful of course but i dont feel like theres anything about her thats just about irresistible to tyrion and irrationally so where he couldnt just find a more cooperative whore i know that some posters have said that maybe show tryion likes that shes more assertive but he kind of just seems annoyed hes lacking a lot of the emotional neediness that fueled his delusions about book shae if i actually believed she was irresistible to him it would go a long ways but i dont"

"Slurktan",2012-04-16,"quite liked the episode in particular the greyjoy stuff was fantastic i really like how they showing theons need for approval one gripe for me was the scene with brienne walking through camp with cat it was just poorly done from a technical standpoint they were very very obviously doing a forced perspective camera shot as there was a different focus between the two of them id guess thats due to the budget as it would cost more to hire standins and then splicing the two together like how it was done in lotr makes me wary of future brienne scenes though actually bothered me quite a bit"

"Shienberg",2012-04-16,"without a doubt the best episode of the season so far and i think it will only get better when i first started reading theon chapters in acok i had to go back and remind myself who he was then by the time we get through adwd his arc is one of my favorites same with jamie i love the way grrm can shift your opinion of characters i am loving theon in the show i think the non book audience will have a hard time hating him because they have grown to sympathize with him however it all depends on how long they are led to believe that bran and rickon are dead you think they could leave that as a season cliffhanger that would be cruel however i think it unlikely speaking of bran i love they way they are handling the bransummer warging however i still dont see how they will handle his story line without the reeds if osha goes with bran then who goes with rickon also the reeds are the ones who teach bran about the children of the forest and of course if we dont get the reed children will that mean no howland assuming howland will be written into the story at some point is there any hope that there will be reeds brienne awesome cant wait for her and jamies journey sansas story on the show is one i find much more interesting than in the book the actress does a great job of making you care about the horrible situation she is in and she hasnt even been forced to marry a dwarf yet i dont love shae but she doesnt really bother me either for those that hate her it will just be that much more satisfying when tyrion chokes her out and as great as everything else was tyrion and ayra still own this story im concerned for the later books when aryas chapters get so few and far between but thats a ways away cant wait for arya and the hound i also enjoyed the scene with arya and yoren although i do prefer the book where arya makes up her murderous prayer on her own but it was a cool moment and worked for tv now when she starts listing names as she goes to bed the audience wont need an explanation and tyrion i see more awards in peter dinklages future sniffing out pycell cutting off the beard and shagga with an axe oh and i almost forgot i agree with those who enjoyed seeing the kinder gentler side of lannister children especially tommen bring on ser pounce"

"TheEvilKing",2012-04-16,"quick thoughts before i read others opinions on this ep easily the best episode of season 3 so far for me it was almost note perfect maybe the fight at the end was a little underwhelming it had so many great emotional moments  mormont with jon snow theon burning the letter the whole scene with balon and theon sansa ayras chat with yoren cerseis scene with tyrion speaking of tyrion i think this was his best ep yet the way he dealt with the councillors was dealt with amusingly and cleverly without being too complex for the casual viewer to follow good to see renly  co i love natalie dormer cracked up when she started talking about bringing her brother in or you can turn me over pretend im him also brienne was pretty spot on and looked hella rank which is correct also loved cats facial expressions during her palaver with renly i prefer showcat to bookcat best scene theons baptism when the priest says but rises again harder and stronger i had goosebumps"
"Nagisa Furukawa",2012-04-16,"i thought episode 3 was the best episode yet this season i think bryan cogman does some of the best scripts for the show you really get a feel for his love of the books in those episodes on the downsides i wish pycelle wouldve been naked and urinating as in the book but i can understand why they didnt but without it i thought the scene felt a little flat in the episode its a good sequence but its one of the funniest bits of the book i agree with those who say yara doesnt have any of ashas charisma and aidan gillens voice continues to be raspy and strangely worded did something happen to him in the last year has he been ill on the upsides tyrions three deceptions was excellent as i expected it to be i was rolling my eyes at some of the tyrionshae argument but it led to the wonderful sansashae scene which i grew to love in its comical bizarreness and then even more when it changes and sansa suddenly broke down at the end i dont recall it in the book if it was i dont remember it happening like this so its probably my favorite original scene of the show just in its uniqueness of tone gods there were so much good stuff in this one maester luwins scene brienne of tarth  what started out as an hbo sex scene â<U+0084> with margaery but turned into an actually brilliant scene with a queen of thorns in training theon burning the letter and being drowned by who looks to be damphair  yorens monologue which is great in its own right and foreshadowing one of the most iconic aspects of aryas character the final attack which was generally well done although i very very much missed winterfell hot pie after having mixed feelings to some aspects in the first two i loved this a whole lot more one other question why was dragonstone which isnt in the episode in the opening credits and not the stormlands which is not a big deal but the locations usually match with where it takes place so thats just a tad bit disappointing too edited by nagisa furukawa 16 april 2012  0605 am"
"Rockroi",2012-04-16,"a few more pointson the sex scenei know a few people lost their poop over watching as opposed to hearing two men smooch and i can understand that there are people in the world who dont want to see that sort of thing i can do without it myself but on the game of thrones gratoitious sex scene meter with 10 being the littlefinger hes just  so  good scene and 0 being any scene with varys watching loras and renly play kissyface was probably a 15 and i am being liberal look people in this universe have sex and the women are hot why make a universe that was not like this what a waste and the men built like juniorleague atlases hence straight people have sex so if straight people are knocking boots then why not gay menand also unlike other sex scenes this added a huge layer to the story most notably that loras who loves renly we think  is playing the game and he wants it for his family and his sister he is willing to cocktease renly and get cockblocked by his own sister in order to see this all fulfilled that is a hugely compelling story line its then brought deeper by lady mcbethmargaery tyrell and her quest to be the hottest powerhungry woman in westeros field is still open and awaiting the arrival of a smoking hot blonde and her three dragons thats legit storytelling right there heres the funny part what is more cringe worthy watching two men make out and clearly enjoy one another or waching renly try to fake interest in his wife renlys wooden recieving of margery was far more ugh thats rough to watch than anything loras was doing to himthis is not to say that loras and renly does not avoid ikville i mean  shaving him really and in both straight and gay scenes if i have to hear another mans cock get sucked and the slurping is she sucking his dick or is somebody cleaning pudding out of the bottom of a purse just gross but but thats my problem ill deal with it lets continueapparently two men kissing for 10 seconds with their clothes on freaks people out but 5 minutes of seeing women writhing all over each other completely naked is a okexcept of course that very few people were okay with it the scene you refer to is the hes just so  good scene and its the cornerstone of the i like boobs but come on guys this is pretty silly camp its one of the most reviled scenes in the series and with compelling reasons i was okay with it because i thought it artistically drew lf outsee i find that whenever we talk about certain issues there is a richteous indignation quotient and i think its overthetop sure the guy who kept calling it homoism what are you twelve is lame but does that mean we all have to just describe how anyone who has any problem with anything immediately gets a label and then everyone else must bend over backwards haha excuse me sorry im twelve to show just how open and awesomly richeous they are in areasjust seems forced to meon the death of yoreni am of two minds on this subject for one as stated above i thought yoren was tremendous at the same time i felt that th estory is missing a major element namely that when you die its not always on a blaze of glory so far we have had at least two characters die while taking out half of the lannister household in the process syrio and hes dead folks and now yoren both die while doing their best impersonation of jackie chan if he were a sword fighter slashing and killing and being well amazingbut thats not the trope of got and asoiaf in martins universe the hero does not die on a blaze of glory sometimes he is killed by a flux sometimes its when his horse falls and crushes his leg under him soemtimes he dies before getting his sword out but with aryas teachers they always seem to die right after unleashing a can of whopass on others and that rings hollow to me i know why they are doing it but i cannot say is as emotionally interesting and complex as finding yoren after the battle and just knowing that hes deadi think that death sometimes is a lot more like jorys than it is yorens sometimes sometimes a fucking asshole stabs you in the eye and youre dead edited by rockroi 16 april 2012  0610 am"
"TheEvilKing",2012-04-16,"it was also nice to see they kept a lot of bran and maester luwins talk about dreams and magic thats a detail i wouldnt have expected to make it into the seriesforgot to mention this scene but yes it was really good im glad theyve keeping some focus on bran  hes been in more eps than robb so far this season  while managing to keep it interesting despite the lack of stuff currently going on at winterfell tremendous job on the warging"
"Ran",2012-04-16,"they only show set locations like castles and cities and such generally speaking thats why there was never a red waste shot as well renlys camp is on the coast of the stormlands apparently near but not actually storms end so thats why its not shown i guess dragonstone well i guess they figure it wasnt necessary to remove it it may be a sign that originally they had intended to have a scene with stannis there though which they dropped spoiler his presence in episode 4 is very abrupt and entirely unheralded i should say so i suppose thats the likeliest explanation they did some sort of scene to set up stanniss presence for episode 4 but didnt like it or it didnt work or they decided it wasnt necessary and dropped it"
"Stallion That Mounts Texas",2012-04-16,"natalie dormer is spectacular she was amazing in the tudors she exemplifies the tyrell quest for power it shows her love for her family as a whole and her brother in particular as smart as she is thanks to the queen of thorns i always suspected that she knew about renly and loras but was content to play her role however this version of renly is all wrong he shows no signs of manliness as opposed to the books aside from his sexual proclivity the book portrays him as robert come again i think book renly would have found himself capable of doing the deed theon is being handled beautifully"
"boojam",2012-04-16,"i have to say that the budget restraints sometimes bother me i liked the scene between yoren and arya but i woiuld have liked that they showed that the men fought the lannisters plus arya gendry and hot pie kind of shine in that momentyeah i noted that on the other thread i think the money budget could have handled it after all its not even a mini blackwater seemed it was the time squeeze that got it i can think of a couple of scenes at kl shortened or eliminated would have given them more time at the battle at the holdfastwise contraction there clever deflection of the gendry problemthe whole trek and capture after the fight gone straight to harrenhal nowweasel gone just a well i guess arya can pick up that name naturally anywaykind of missed the harrowing suspense and bravery of arya in the freeing of jaqen hghar and time crunch of fitting everything into 10 episodes beginning to wonder how much of cok will be pushed into season 3 edited by boojam 16 april 2012  0612 am"

"Kaitscralt",2012-04-16,"i loved this episode so much really great might end up going down as one of my favorites of the entire series when all is said and done here are my only three nitpicks 1 i love peters tyrion and his scenes are always among the episodes best but i wouldnt have minded seeing one other story arc instead of so much tyrion 2 alfies theon plaed into the slap a bit strong he like flew across the room as if the incredible hulk had struck him but his father is a scary guy and maybe just is that strong 3 the ending shot of the bull helmet was a bit anticlimatic after seeing the kid run off with it five minutes earlier and then die that kid doesnt exactly look like a blacksmiths apprentice either but nobody said the lannister menatarms were smart"
"David Selig",2012-04-16,"really good episode i really liked most of it  brienne is spot on the way renly and margaery are developed is really interesting and well presented theons standing up to his father and asking him why he got the blame for balons failure was something ive wondered a few times why he didnt do in the books and was done very well tyrions scenes were excellent some of the best dinklage moments yet the way he said make do to shagga about the goat was awesome michelle fairley was impressive as always memorable ending too id sure miss yoren a lot the only thing i didnt like was the sansa  shae scene it felt pointless and sansa was a bit too petulant i am really interested how the idea of getting lf involved into jaimes release will develop it has the potential to be either really good but a lot of things can go wrong if the writers are not careful another meeting between lf and cat is certainly something id love to see theres so much potential for good drama there edited by david selig 16 april 2012  0654 am"

"James Arryn",2012-04-16,"i think its a little of both but if i had to argue about one word in this discussion it would be in the connotation that the gay sex scenes are in any way gratuitousâ<U+0080><U+009D>for starters i am 100 with you on the change in renlys character being harder to accept the guys who do the parody got from season 1 have this small addon where they show the cool book renly and how he is replaced with weaker renly from the show it ends with new renly complaining that he has a booboo this renly is a baby when he needs to turn on the charm and the gravitas he can do it obviously on display with cat and his people but in private hes weak and in way over his headbut i want to stress that from a plotdevelopment pov its not a bad change at all its far far more easy to understand how renly was able to win over the reach now that we know what he is its because he didnt have anything to do with it the tyrells found their tool and decided to appear like they were hitching their wagon to his star but in reality renly is just a passanger here the tyrells are in this and they know it not their problem if renly hasnt caught up i truly love how maergery tyrell has developed she is a fierce player and maybe part of the problem is sexism insofar as anytime a man appears weak in the face of a strong woman we sometimes think him effeminine thats not fair though however overall renlys homosexuality has nothing to do with him being weakbut when you add in renlys gayness there can be a reaction to resort to the stereotype and a negative one at that and honestly i liked him better in the book because he was entirely not swishy stereotype renly was butch gay he was this tough charismatic endearing guy who had flash and substance and he had absoultely no confidence problem at all series renly is not that he does seem to exude the sterotype but as others have said loras certainly does not loras to turn a phrase seems far more like book renly than renly doesi think this renly works because in this universe the series as opposed to the book his homosexuality is an active part of this story and not some gratoitious addon its up to the viewer to accept it at face value and not playout the sterotype because it has nothing to do with this story renly is weak and reaching for more than he can handle because he is a thirdborn unproven untested boy who lives in the shadow of his two badass brothers and he is being told by tyrell after tyrell that he is loved and so he rolls the dice and he is utterly in over his headand when you simply look at renly as a gay man the sex scenes lose their taboo feel and once that happens the story comes alive renly has no reason to hide his homosexuality from maergery she is fine with it and she is trying to teach him to be fine with it hes a king act like it a king can have a man and a woman and another man if he wants hes the kingbecause in the end this comes down to what maergery wants she wants a king in her stomach and renly being gay has absolutely nothing to do with thatthats why it worksi should clarify that i didnt object to the gay sex scene for its own sake or find it gratuitous at alli just find the complete weakening of the character coincidental with the decision to completely amp up the degree to which being gay is a central characteristic a bad combinationand as you say its not just that he goes from being a brave able warrior to afraid of bloodthey downplay him pretty much across the board his confidence and charisma which in the book are 3 dimensional and very real in the show come off as forced and kinda squirmy like for example how he deals with cats challenges in the show he pauses kinda twitches a bit forces a smile and makes the best of itin the book he genuinely laughs talks about her besting his defenders with words and smoothly overcomes the difficulty about titlesthats just one exampleyou mentioned otherswe never get a sense in the book that renly is being lead is indecisive and in need of constant prodding we never get the sense that loras is the dominant one in the relationship or margery in the marriage whenever renlys there hes the one who commands attention and admiration in the books hes a man in the show hes a childand lastly my own impression based on the vague evidence from the book is that hes not necessarily exclusively gay he talks pretty openly about getting margery pregnant etc and more i dont get the sense that to whatever degree he is gay is something hes ashamed about again you get a sense of a man completely at ease with what and who he is whereas in the show he seems nervous and insecure about almost everythingid like to add that i dont blame the actor the character as written hes playing pretty well and i also think that i can understand to a degree why they are marginalizing renly and possibly stannis too many titans the book has room enough for a bunch of awesome peoplebut in a 10 hour show too many will reduce scope and come off cartoonishi just wish theyd picked another means that an easy stereotype edited by james arryn 16 april 2012  1110 am"

"James Arryn",2012-04-16,"the reason people havent brought up the idea that the shows portrayal of renly means gay  soft is because of loras who may be very good looking but hes also a great jouster a talented warrior one of the most valiant knights in the seven kingdoms who reveals that hes worked damned hard to be in that position and who draws blood to force renly to look and accept the cost of powerso gaysoft doesnt exist as a stereotype here theres different kinds of people thats all and sexuality doesnt really figureto a degree but within the confines of the show weve seen him engaged in 3 fights1 he wins by cheating 1 he gets saved by the hound 1 he gets beaten by brienneits pretty in line with the book in terms of results but the emphasis is differentthe cheating is more of a possibility in the book in the show its an explanation the hound thing i think played out fairly but he looked more like a scared kid than i imagined in the book and from what i recall in the fight with brienneand this may be faulty memorybut i seem to recall briennes bullrush as a kind of desparate last gasp that loras was pretty much winning before she caught him off guard with that and there was an implication that that like the mountain joust was possibly borderline behavior which contrary to the loras aspect is downplayed in the showyeah just checked the text its explicit loras was very much winning the fight and briennes bullrush was a desperate last gasp after loras had disarmed her and comments were made about it being a vile trickim not even saying it was but the contrast is again thereboth fights have insinuations about tricks loras is made explicit and unchallenged briennes is unmentionedand beyond that much secondary stuff is made about the knight of flowers being an acknowledged prodigy with arms whereas here the secondary stuff mostly deals with him being popular with the girls and his personality comes off a little more petulant and whiny than in the book where hes mostly arrogant but gallantso in general id say that while i agree with you that in contrast with renly loras is portrayed as brave warrior etc even that is diminished in contrast with the book and looked at together they are much less than they were in the text edited by james arryn 16 april 2012  1140 am"
"ace",2012-04-16,"i should clarify that i didnt object to the gay sex scene for its own sake or find it gratuitous at alli just find the complete weakening of the character coincidental with the decision to completely amp up the degree to which being gay is a central characteristic a bad combinationand as you say its not just that he goes from being a brave able warrior to afraid of bloodthey downplay him pretty much across the board his confidence and charisma which in the book are 3 dimensional and very real in the show come off as forced and kinda squirmy like for example how he deals with cats challenges in the show he pauses kinda twitches a bit forces a smile and makes the best of itin the book he genuinely laughs talks about her besting his defenders with words and smoothly overcomes the difficulty about titlesthats just one exampleyou mentioned otherswe never get a sense in the book that renly is being lead is indecisive and in need of constant prodding we never get the sense that loras is the dominant one in the relationship or margery in the marriage whenever renlys there hes the one who commands attention and admiration in the books hes a man in the show hes a childand lastly my own impression based on the vague evidence from the book is that hes not necessarily exclusively gay he talks pretty openly about getting margery pregnant etc and more i dont get the sense that to whatever degree he is gay is something hes ashamed about again you get a sense of a man completely at ease with what and who he is whereas in the show he seems nervous and insecure about almost everythingid like to add that i dont blame the actor the character as written hes playing pretty well and i also think that i can understand to a degree why they are marginalizing renly and possibly stannis too many titans the book has room enough for a bunch of awesome peoplebut in a 10 hour show too many will reduce scope and come off cartoonishi just wish theyd picked another means that an easy stereotypei never really got the impression from the books of renly being particularly macho or as a brave able warrior hes confident charismatic easy going fun to hang around with but not aggressive domineering or especially war like in fact this is particularly noticeable in the conversation with stannis as the contrast between stannis the humorless macho warrior and renly who treats stannis and his army as a kind of joke remember the peachwhen he talks about getting marg pregnant its more like i know how to do what i need to do than i cant wait to bed her and thats in response to stannis questioning whether he knows what to do with a woman in fact there are gay stereotypes about him in the books too i mean come on rainbow guard"

"Lord Varys",2012-04-16,"actually i thought loras asking cat if robb had already attacked lord tywin strongly indicated that tv renly also made the strategic decision to let the lannisters and starks weaken each other before he made his move im really happy with tv renly by the way he showed confidence in himself in public he makes decisions as he sees fit and is not pushed around by loras and margaery and they also gave us a glimpse why his men loved him of course we knew from last season that he would not be book renly the one thing i found irritating is that he is supposed to be this closeted about his relationship with renly margaery revealing that she knew was a great scene in itself but book renly would not have cared about his bannermen knowing about his sexual preferences and the tyrells most certainly knew everything about it thats why they sent loras as renlys squire to storms end in the first place but i really liked the fact that renly was not able to consummate his marriage both loras and margaery are very aware of the fact that highgarden expects that maces grandson will sit on the iron throne margaerys character is also not really distorted yes she is older and yes she shows her intelligencecapabilities as a plotter early no but so what we only get innocent book margaery because we are never in her head nor privy to any personal conversation between the tyrells or margaery and renly that sansa does not see through margaery in asos does not mean that margaery is a nice and innocent girl oh and by the way i cant see that adult margaery can be interpreted as a sign that they will drop lady olenna in the series its unthinkable that they would even consider omitting like the queen of thorns from the series she would be far to great fun on screen and i also really like the reason why tyrion is going to send littlefinger to renly tyrion and cat did not bond all that much during their trip to the vale so it would have been rather difficult to establish why catelyn would trust that any lannister would exchange jaime for her daughters but if littlefinger is going to deliver an official offer from the hand of the king she will not only consider it but i really hope we will not going to see all that negotiation stuff for margaerys hand after renlys death the tyrells saving the day at the blackwater should be as much a surprise in the series as it was in the books"

sense and are welcome this is especially important when they need to show situations where in the book there was no point of view character whose thoughts could be narrated the theon letter was great the lannister luncheon scene was very well done and even the sansa and shae bit was perfectly acceptable unlike last week the craster portions were a bit weak this time around i agree we had to show the others again and it was a good addition i just donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know that i believe this weekâ<U+0080><U+0099>s segue and resolution mormont helped thoughspeaking of nonpov additions theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve done a good job here making renly by far the most likable of the three baratheon brothers heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a decent fellow and even pretty hot if you like that kind of thing i thought the â<U+0080><U+009C>flowersandwichâ<U+0080><U+009D> of renly between the two tyrell siblings worked very well seeing renly and loras playing together was a lot more believable this season than last and itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s relieving to see honest affection in a normal healthy relationship there isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t a lot of that in this show i think the only other tender kiss weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen in the series was when ned kissed cat goodbye in kingâ<U+0080><U+0099>s landing long ago and far away all the rest have been pretty gross prostitutes and such of course just like ned and cat renly and loras are doomed lovers whose time together is short interesting that theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re the only couples shown in a good light and theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re the ones that are quickly separated by outside betrayal and death really sad poignant even loras seems to be fleshing out a bit characterwise and maybe bodywise too which is good although iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m not in pouty myself weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll be seeing him for a long time that said i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t find loras to be â<U+0080><U+009C>prettyâ<U+0080><U+009D> nor particularly appealing read hot but renly shows a playful cute smile here almost elfin in places which makes him a good foil for lorasâ<U+0080><U+0099>s sister as for the triangle to be honest thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s pretty much how i always pictured things going on behind closed doors that margaery always knew about renly and loras i really liked renly this time around you wonder what was going through his mind in all his scenes especially those with cat natalie dormer has one of those magical faces with oversized almond eyes like something out of a manga comic she is truly beautiful iâ<U+0080><U+0099>m glad theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve strengthened her rale and found such a convincing actress too considering how important sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll be later oniâ<U+0080><U+0099>m afraid i myself wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have had renlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s misgivings over hopping in the sack with margaery â<U+0080><U+0094> what can i say â<U+0080><U+0094> but i suppose he was really conflicted because of the awkwardness of what he thought was his secret once he gets it sorted in his head it should be easier next time probably with a willing tag team by the tyrells i always thought that renly had consumated his marriage but that for whatever reason margaery just didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t get preggers from it i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t recall how long they were married before renlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s evil murderi loved brienne the reveal was well worth the wait canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t wait to see her interact with jaime i wish weâ<U+0080><U+0099>d seen more of jaqen but that too will comeoverall the episode gets a grade of b or aâ<U+0092> so probably a high 8 in a 1â<U+0080><U+0093>10 system itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s certainly the strongest weâ<U+0080><U+0099>ve seen this

"CrypticWeirwood",2012-04-16,"i am disappointed that renly in the series is so stereotypically gay he is i really donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t think so he seems pretty normal to me"
"ace",2012-04-16,"renly competes in tourneys and acquits himself well never remotely displays fear of battle or blood etc its a stark contrastre the peach i think we read that differently hes always lighthearted but that wasnt a sign of weakness imo it was complete confidenceno again the pregnancy thing was said with complete confidence hes contrasted with stannis not defensive and the rainbow thing i think grrm has specifically stated that he didnt remotely think of that as a gay signit was the seven colors and reflected renlys love of pageantry and willingness to create his own traditionsand more the disbelief everyone has of the official status of margarys pregnancy can only be down to a belief that renly was at least bisexualloras competes in tourneys too and in rl there are gay soldiers in fact the ancient greeks considered gays to be the best soldiers and their elite units were all gay dont see how competing and even doing well in tourneys contradicts him being gayi agree hes very confident in fact cat comments that hes too confident as he leaves most of his army behind when he rides to storms end but that doesnt translate to him being a great warrior might be the opposite in factim sure hes confident of being able to father children gays can father children too he might not enjoy it as much as a straight guy but its a small price to pay for the iron throne the fact that stannis comments on his ability to get margaery pregnant suggests that him being gay is at least rumored"

"Arya The Assassin",2012-04-16,"good acting overall and several good scenes just like in the previous episodes i have mixed feelings about natalie dormer though in terms of performance she seems to be at least a decent choice based on the few scenes she appeared in but her scenes didnt work too well imo in fact id have preferred a bit less nudity because the focus is shifted away from the performance and the core of the scene i think a less direct approach wouldve worked better this episode was slightly better written than the first two episodes although it wasnt as exciting as the second onegoodbrienne her size mannerisms and her looks is spot on the character seems a bit stiff and dry but i think thats deliberate because thats the impression i got from the character in the book as well it remains to be seen if the actor can manage to bring out some of the edginess and sadness of the character thoughthe scene with bran stark and luwin well written and good acting from these guys as usual nice subjective shootingthe sequence in which tyrion outwits pycelle interesting editing work therethe scene with theon and balon greyjoy malahide is without doubt at least imo one of the best additions to the cast in season 2the last sequence a short but wellacted scene by maisie and the leader of the group dont remember his name cool fighting scenes and a nice cliffhangerbadnot too enthusiastic about the love scene with renly and loras the scene with renly and margaery wasnt too erotic or sexy either as mentioned earlier but to be fair i find love scenes in general to be rather boring and too directshaes scenes its hard to come up with a rational explanation here but i simply dont like the attitude of the character although the acting isnt terrible its not particularly good either imo in many ways i feel sibel is miscast in her roleid rate this episode 7 out of 10 i still think the second episode has been the best so far but the show was never boring my interest dropped just a bit in some of the weaker scenesso far the beginning of season one has been a bit stronger than season two but i hope this season will improve as the expositoryintroductory stuff starts to give way to more conflicts and intrigue last year i seem to remember that after a strong beginning it dropped a little bit but by midseason it got better and better again and they managed to keep up the quality all the way to the last episode edited by arya the assassin 16 april 2012  0228 pm"

"Ponyo Payne",2012-04-16,"in regards to shea and sansa and im sorry if i repeat something because i have not read this whole thread here are my thoughts shea is kind of a lame character the acting may be part of it sometimes people with a strong accent can be a little hard to read if you cant get into the rythym of how they speak so i will allow for a little of that but i will be really disappointed if there is not some kind of pay off for her mysterious background also it does not make sense that she grew up in any sort of noble household because whether she was a lady or a servant she would have a good idea of what a handmaiden does even if she is not good at doing it as far as how sansa acts in the scene with shae i dont think her behavior was that bad she has to be asking hereself why cersei would send her a completely ignorant hadmaiden the lanisters are probably the most sophisticated house in westeros and sansa is betrothed to the king she has to believe this is not an accident which it isnt she probably can think of no good reason she would get a servant like this which only leave her more unsettled the servant does not act like a servent either an actual sevant in this position would be humble scared and would be begging her ladys pardon so sansa has to be feeling that she is being screwed with in another new way so she can either act like she is scared of some new trap or go the more defiant route and say just screw it"

"snax",2012-04-16,"overall id rank the renley shave scene as sexier than the pycelle one different strokes for different folks i guessthe way shae acted around tyrion was a bit problematic as it makes her eventual betrayal less surprising and hurtful in the books she was so sweet and submissive to tyrion that one starts to think she might actually harbour some feelings for him even though yes we know shes a whore thats the same gripe i have about margaerys portrayal in the tv series it erases any shred of doubt that she might just might be an unsuspecting innocent"

"Dragon greyscale",2012-04-16,"best episode of the season looks like were finally gaining some steam i especially liked the editing of tyrions scheming that said i think it was a scene that was primarily enjoyable for readers my nonreading girlfriend was totally confused and we had to rewind thing is the people tyrion starts to talk about have barely been introduced myrcella and dorne or fading in memory this season the vale this was inevitable but perhaps they could have shifted the dialogue by starting with varys to whom tyrion talks about theon a familiar name at this point this is not a big issue by any means but i just really thought it was remarkable how nonreaders and readers experience the show differently i thought it was awesome while my girlfriend was totally confused alfie allen rules as theon and the show really does a good job in drawing out his character i have never understood the theon haters and thankfully the show portrays him as three dimensional as i picture theon to be on lorasrenly besides theons scene with the captains daughter this was the only sexintimacy scene in this season that really served the plot on a meaningful way homophobes should gtfo sex and intimacy in drama is not just meant to turn us on its there to tell a story not to have us masturbate thats what porn is for"

"hoelk",2012-04-16,"overall id rank the renley shave scene as sexier than the pycelle one different strokes for different folks i guessthe way shae acted around tyrion was a bit problematic as it makes her eventual betrayal less surprising and hurtful in the books she was so sweet and submissive to tyrion that one starts to think she might actually harbour some feelings for him even though yes we know shes a whore thats the same gripe i have about margaerys portrayal in the tv series it erases any shred of doubt that she might just might be an unsuspecting innocentdid you read the same book as i did for me bookshea was obviously just playing her part i guess even tyrion knew it in a way but he wanted to believe she felt for him i think showshea feels like a much more genuine real person edited by hoelk 16 april 2012  0538 pm"

"TyrionFan57",2012-04-16,"here is my biggest complaint about this episode the opening sequence showed dragonstone and the dothraki wasteland and we didnt go there i thought that each opening was tailor made to reflect the locations that we would visit in that episodeother than that this episode was just about perfect the best actor in the show turns out to be a twelve year old girl my god miasie was phenomenal again tonight someone should nominate her for an emmy this year peter motherfg dinkledge was outstanding as well all of the tyrion scenes were not only brilliantly written but superbly delivered as well gwendolyn christie is brienne as that character is one of my largest book crushes i cant wait until she meets me in real life and falls madly and passionately in love with me all of the greyjoys rock even asha who is growing on me by leaps and boundsthat leaves me with the two controversies that we have been discussing here the first is renlyloras i am heterosexual as well and i am not turned on by a scene in which two men act in a sexual manner with one another that said i am also an adult and just because i am not inclined to be aroused by it doesnt mean that i cant watch it and enjoy it specifically when it is in perfect context with what the author wrote about his characters both characters did a wonderful job of acting in this scene and it set up perfectly the later conflict between loras and brienne it also gave us an understanding of the maidenhood of margery which will become an essential plot point as the story goes this scene was absolutely necessary to advance the plot of the tv show and if you are too immature to watch then switch the damn channel for two minutes and dont burden the rest of us with your homophobiathat leaves me with shae she is a completely different character in this show the problem that i have had is that i keep trying to reconcile her to the shae of the books well five episodes into her story arc this is obviously not the case tonight i tried to keep an open mind with the actress and just judge her on her performance she is actually doing a fantastic job it is obvious to me that her direction is to be arrogant and a bit unlikeable i think that dd is doing this because they were afraid they couldnt redeem the character of tyrion after he kills her to a tv audience i personally think that they could but it would be extremely tricky i dont begrudge them at all for going the easier route on this onei can see your point but from my perspective i think they should be making her more likeable now instead of less likeable this would increase the shock value when 1 she turns on tyrion at his trial and 2 tyrion discovers her in his fathers bed just those two things would be enough i think to redeem tyrions character in the eyes of many"
"Chelly",2012-04-16,"okay adding to the previous post this morning of my thoughts on the episode the cersei and sansa scene was extremely good i love the sly little look she gives sansa when she asks tommen is he would like it if joff kills robbsuch bitchy and malicious thing to do so cersei of course tommen being the sweetie cutie that he is told his mother that he wouldnt like that at all im not sure how i feel about the shae and sansa scene though i didnt mind shae at all in the first season and i actually prefer tv shae over book shae but shae is starting to sound more like a spoiled brat than a erm professional worker whose also a grown woman shes coming off more like book shae who is a young immature sort of naive girl and in the show shes supposed to be this somewhat mysterious experienced smart woman who matches tyrions wits and throws his crap back at him i couldnt stand her stomping around in sansas chambers it could have been the scene because i didnt like that scene it did crack me up when shae had the nerve to pick on sansas leftovers as she was cleaning the table right in front of sansa that was pretty amusing thats my only complaint and it was such a minor scene so it doesnt bother me that much everything else has been spectacular though"

"tearloch",2012-04-17,"on sansa  shae i get the dislike for shae i also get sansas reaction to her in her mind shae is just another spy for the queen i think the actress playing shae is annoying but overall i like the way hbo is portraying her she was sympathetic in the books but alwasy through tyrions pov up until he finds her in the sack with someone else hbo is not limited to the pov views of characters and i feel that hbo is capturing the true shae true it will reduce the agony of her betrayal for the viewers but there will be plenty of jaw droppers to come too many might turn off some viewerson the reeds i was very disappointed in the reeds not being in season 2 i do think they will have to add them very early in season 3 since it appears that theon takes winterfell in episode 8 this season then maybe the reeds are on their way to winterfell see the sack happen and just wait in the woods happening onto hodor bran rickon and osha as they escape i think the decision not to cast the reeds in season 2 was all about  season 2 will get rid of some more main characters so that frees up budget space for the reeds 1 renly  2 reeds that sounds like a bargain to me"

"Golden Brown",2012-04-17,"i find it funny that they introduced renly in the third episode there was quite some talk about him and the power he has in the first two episodes now that he finally made an appearance stannis will land at storms end in the next episode and judging by the preview for episode 4 we will be seeing shadowbabies and we all know what that means i am sure that the showmakers want to make renlys death something like ned starks death not such a huge surprise of course and i think that two episodes wont be enough to make us sympatise with him and his death and isnt that why they probably changed him so much from the book there he was more charismatic but a shallow character robert reborn and when he died i was surprised but i didnt feel sorry for renly here is a much more stereotypical gay but a much more complex charater and i think he is more likable than in the books i can more easily identify with him that probably makes me one of the few that actually like show renly i guess edited by golden brown 17 april 2012  0942 am"

"Lyana",2012-04-18,"first id like to point out that as a bookreader i find the 3rd episode awesome in one other thread ive indicated that i found the first two episodes very well dreicted with more emphasis on the appearance than on the content more than i come back to the third episode i find more amazing cinematographic decisions plus the wellmade and condensed storylines that makes it for me the best episode of the second season so far however i fond the reaction of the nonbook readers arrond me who watch the show very interesting a colleague of mine despite the fact that he didnt understand many scenes in the first two episodes finds them more interesting than the third one he considers the last episode more boring although he needed no extra explanations this time now to the actual point of this post  i liked that episode 3 started right from the end of the previous one i dont find the acting of kit harington poor i find his interactions with lc mormont very successful sam and gilly were also fine about the whole cliffhanger and crastersneakouttogiveawayhisson thing i find it a bit weird for the bookreaders but very helpful for those who havent read the books so it was not completely pointless imo  the scenes with bran and his wolfdreams are a great bonus his interaction with maester luwin is pretty well done and the direwolf looked great as always  the theon part was the highlight of this episode  the acting the script the directing  everything works together to show us one conflicted and deep character in one moment after the interaction with his father you kind of feel sorry for him and soon after that you hate him for burning the warning letter to robb im so far at the end of asos so i dont particularly like the greyjoys but all the scenes with them are great so far  brienne was huge the actress who plays this character works for me i also feel the chemistry between her and catelyn think those two will make a great tandem also catelyn talking about how renly is only playing war was nice  renly  loras  margaery  the way those characters were introduced was kind of unexpected for me but their interactions were well made and showed significant features of their characters im fine with the renly  loras scene and loved the way margaery is portrayed in the show however i think she will look a bit odd next to joffrey in the thirdfourth season  tyrion oh tyrion  the master of the game smilepng classbbcemoticon alt   that was great episode for him  owning the scenes with his presence and his amazing acting what could i say more the riddle of varys was my favourite scene love that it was included in the show one think that bothers me is that shae is being too cocky what does he like about her the scene with the tree letters was excellent and the givehismanhoodtothegoatsexchange was so funny smilepng classbbcemoticon alt   the scenes with sansa were very moving i almost felt her desperation the actress does some great job here congrats  and we come to the end with one of my favourites  arya the kid is growing really fast soon she will be almost as tall as gendry the backstory of yoren was neccessary for the nonbook readers imo not to feel confused when arya suddenly comes up with her night prayer maisie is a great actress how do you sleep at night that was a fineperformed line saying it while sharpening her blade chilly smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  i dont mind that her storyline was condensed but wellcome this decision sorry for yoren he was really great cant wait for the next episode the show is getting better smilepng classbbcemoticon alt "

"Sword in the Morning",2012-04-18,"okay in regards to the sansashae scene let me lay this all out for you bit by bit first off they skipped right past the parts where shae was kept in the kitchens and with lollys because those would have required them to cast more characters in a series based on books with such an incredibly huge amount of characters they need to boil it down to those necessary to move the plot forward while still maintaining as much faithfulness to the books as possible this was also their reasoning for cutting out jacelyn bywater and just using bronn also in the show aside from her expression and responses when interacting with joffrey we really havent gotten to see how her position has affected her personally we dont get to read her stream of consciousness we dont get to see her thoughts and we havent seen her cry into the pillow at night you may know that happens from reading the books but i feel the books have clouded your perceptions of the showsomeone who hasnt read them wont have seen the despair shes going through yes they could have written a scene in which she crawls into bed one night and cries herself to sleep but that would have been airtime with only a single purposecharacterizing sansa the scene as it is introduces shaes new role as handmaiden shows how ludicrously unprepared she is which in turn gives logical basis for sansa to be suspicious and furthermore it gives us that characterization of sansa being overwhelmed and barely able to keep it together in this awful situation shes in i dont think it makes her look bitchy at allit makes her look human if she didnt break down didnt finally lose her composure once that last straw broke the camels back and in a safe environment for her to do so no less she would make much less sense as a character beyond this the show is getting a much richer portrayal of shae than the books in the books you only saw her from tyrions perspective this sweet little sex kitten precious beyond anything and maybepossibly returning his feelings of affection in this scene we get to see her interacting with someone else which highlights how shes just sort of entitled and bitchy it brings to life the i didnt want to do real people work so i ran off and started selling my body sort of mentality she has so there in my opinion it was a worthwhile scene and people on these forums actively look for things to complain about in both the books and the show"

"The Second Hand",2012-04-19,"give them extra millions and they will give you an answerand i understand that yet money is spent on littlefinger and ros having indepth hokey conversation again its an example of david and dan trying so hard to stamp the seriesi know ive skewed negatively so far but i do really like the show i thought the first season was truly great in some instances but i remain disappointed still with the adaptating of the material"
"Lyana",2012-04-19,"i cannot stop thinking about this episode i think it may be my favorite not only of this season but the entire series so far little nuances keep coming to my mind at such random times i was saddened to hear that some nonbook readers were bored because in their words there wasnt any of the blond girl im wondering how much many who havent read the books are really reacting to the theon story and if they get it i mean to us its just the beginning of theons incredible journey also tyrion and varys are perfection together i cannot get enough of them margaery tyrell is very spicy its funny when i first heard about natalie dormer i immediately pictured her as playing asha greyjoy solely based on how we meet her i was a fan of hers on the tudors where she played anne boleyn but her interpretation of margaery is intriguing i supposed in the books we didnt get an extreme insight into margaerys drive just other peoples interpretation of her but still amazingmy thoughts exactly i realized how difficult it should be to adapt the series to the tv show so both readers and nonreaders to be pleased it is a really difficult taski think the nonbook readers respond to certain characters who they already know from the first season it would be now difficult for them to bond with all the new ones who have completely new storylinesmy boyfreind who hasnt read the book but watches the show doesnt think much of stannis and wasnt very bothered when theon burned the letter he was like meh sh happensit this is just the beginning of the season and hope that the further episodes will change his attitude"
"tearloch",2012-04-19,"so like i said earlier in the thread why not use any of the existing cliffhangers in the books why make up one  and why make one up that doesnt flow actually the show is being made for me since i am one of those people you talk about watching it just like it is made for you and every other viewer my breathing is just fine  no need to worry about that no im not in the know about what they have written for future episodes  but why does that preclude questioning decisions on what they have shown us so far they have made a very good adaption overall  but more than a few of the deviations they have chosen to make have not added anything to an all ready rich story so please notch down the self righteousness a littleafter episode 2 aired this place blew up with comments about the crasterjon cliffhanger yes it was not part of the books episode 3 brought us right back to the where we should be based on the books all hbo did was take several chapters worth of dialogue explaining what is going on with craster and condensed it down to jon witnessing it happening this is on screen visuals are preferred they are faster and cheaper to get the same point across at the end of episode 3 we know what craster is doing we know that the nights watch knows what he is doing and lets him do it because he still supports them when needed we understand gillys fear of staying with craster we have the seeds of a sam  gilly romance and we have the nights watch moving on sure jon has a bump on the nogin and a bruised ego but hbo brilliantly condensed this part of the plot down to fit into the timeline that they have to use being a 10 episode season"

"Leuf",2012-04-19,"first time ive been able to get on the forums since the ep airedi really cant believe that mormont knows the full extent of what crasters doing im gonna assume that he thought craster just left the sons out in the woods to die so they wouldnt pose a threat to him but the idea that the lord commander of the nights watch knows about the others and has done precisely squat about is just too ridiculousin the book gilly flat out tells jon hes giving the sons to the others and jon and mormont have a talk about it jon neglects to mention the part about the others and just focuses on the part about giving his sons to the woods which mormont already knows so if anything the show has somewhat fixed this part of the book since jon at least isnt sure what he saw in the book theres no explanation why jon is not freaking the fuck out about this and telling mormont you knew everything jon snowas far as the sansashae scene goes in the book the first sansa chapter is the one where she saves dontos in the second sansa chapter she gets the note from him so theres absolutely nothing from the book that contradicts how sansa might be acting at this point in the story in the relative privacy of her own room after she just had to sit through being taunted by cersei nor does this scene mean that theyve taken time away from her and anyone else since its been inserted into the timeline im now really curious how we are going to get the line that we know we are getting that is supposed to be the reaction of tyrion to cersei having alayaya tortured since shae is already sansas maid way way early how does that scene happen theres lots of speculation that ros is being used for alayayas part but theres no need for alayaya with shae already sansas maid is cersei going to actually get shae i was starting to accept ros since she was getting a part that was actually in the books but if she doesnt get it then im back to hating herthere hasnt been much discussion of tyrion sending lf to arrange jaimes release with cat i think i see where they are going with this i think they need cat to free jaime before the sack of winterfell because theyve rearranged the timelines so much so she needs some other motivation than thinking bran and rickon are dead i think lf is going to say something like we both know we arent going to work out a deal that both robb and cerseityrion will accept but if you take it upon yourself to free jaime ill take it upon myself to free sansa it would give an interesting wrinkle to his later actions after jaime finally gets back to kl or maybe hell lie and tell her that arya is deadwhile im totally on board with shortening up aryas story i dont like that amory was sent to get gendry i miss that arya  co were passing all the refugees headed for kl which builds up the tension in both her story and in kl and then just get caught up in the lannisters waging total war in the riverlands after having to leave the kingsroad amory looking for gendry makes for a tighter story to that arc but disconnects it from the story at large it makes the whole story more disjointed and i agree with the one person earlier who though yoren was too much of a badass at the end it just cheapens it for other characters like syrio selmy and jaime when characters like yoren can also cut through the red shirts just as easily as they canthere was so much complaining about the casting of renly and loras last season and thats mostly died down this season i think by next season most everyone will have gotten used to ashayara the actor playing loras looks like he got the memo all the rest of the male cast got before last season about looking like theyve been to the gym with their shirts off"

"Aegnor",2012-04-19,"im worried about something which im not sure if it has been mentioned earlier in the thread so in this episode weve seen that shae is now sansas maid hence removing the need for alayaya or similar character i thought ros was going to fill that role until this episode squashed that now we have seen in previews tyrion giving his line about how he would hurt her for this and how her joy would turn to ashes awesome line from the book however now there is no place to use that unlesscercei finds out about shae for real and does something to her kills her or something that would obviously significantly change events from book 3 no longer would shae brutally betray tyrion and then hook up with his father nor would tyrion kill her i honestly think this is where it is headed and i dont like it his betrayal and his murder of shae has a massive affect on his character i hope im wrong but im guessing well see in a few weeks"

"boojam",2012-04-21,"it does feel like the writers are trying to insert littlefinger into the show a lot more than in the books worth noting producers dd have stated when they have a good actor they feel aesthetically an obligation to give them screen time their problem is that they have picked so damn many excellent actors this can become a plot driver even within 10 hours of visual presentation and narrative compression it takes a lot of ingenuity something that one can do on the page is harder in front of the camera even tho one can present a lot of exposition quickly visually the viewers familiar with the prose narrative should look on the visual narrative as something that can not be a transliteration as long as the essential story is presented"
"Rockroi",2012-04-21,"worth noting producers dd have stated when they have a good actor they feel aesthetically an obligation to give them screen time their problem is that they have picked so damn many excellent actors this can become a plot driverits very obvious that this is what they are doing also remember that these actos have publicists and others who routinely lobby to get their guygal more screen times"

"rmholt",2012-04-21,"as i hadnt heard any discussion of this probably not enough time to comb through all the threads i thought i was the only one i love peter dinklage as tyrion but i find his bad accent so distracting it actually snaps me out of enjoying his performances frown5gif classbbcemoticon altfrown5 who is to say what sort of accent he would have this isnt earth"

"rmholt",2012-04-21,"okay in regards to the sansashae scene let me lay this all out for you bit by bitfirst off they skipped right past the parts where shae was kept in the kitchens and with lollys because those would have required them to cast more characters in a series based on books with such an incredibly huge amount of characters they need to boil it down to those necessary to move the plot forward while still maintaining as much faithfulness to the books as possible this was also their reasoning for cutting out jacelyn bywater and just using bronnshae never in the kitchens otherwise yes"

"dem",2012-04-21,"the ashayara stuff baffles me just because the character is a very sexual person in the novels everyone assumes shes a complete knockout if anything i love that the actress playing her is a curvier girl im a sucker for them and theyve been kind of missing from the show up until now shes the type of character that denies her gender and the typical roles associated with it i never cease to be amazed by the great choices made by the casting directors people also complained about tywins lack of muttonchops in the show even though charles dance is perfect in the role oh well"
"rmholt",2012-04-21,"if in future episodes they play up a cerseis informants then ill retract that complaint but to me at the moment it looks more like theyre emphasising that sansa is still a highborn lady and is very used to being waited on hand and foot i cant think of any significant plot advance that happens as a result of cerseis informers the only one that springs to mind is that tyrion provides it as a reason to employ shae  which has already happenedits not nearly as obvious as people here might have you think basically catelyn observes that he spends more time talking to loras than margaery over dinner he asks loras to stay and pray with him and loras is particularly devastated when hes killedand the threat of jaime to loras to stick his sword in a place even renly never found"

"Dr. Pepper",2012-04-15,"i am torn on how i feel about this episode so i gave it a five i was pleasantly surprised with how marg was portrayed when i saw the casting i did not feel comfortable that she was to be portrayed as older than loras and renly or that she was more the mastermind behind the tyrells but i liked it and can see a lot of promise in the adaptation of this particular storyline totally whooped with glee with brienne gwendoline christie nailed it i found her totally believable as the character i thought it might have been clever camera work to make her appear so tall then i looked up her actual height having natural attributes that contribute to a books character certainly helps with onscreen believability i still do not like this portrayal of asha her attitude is so different from the books it makes me feel uncomfortable i thought perhaps i interpreted her character wrong but ive reread some of her scenes and chapters and i dont get dull insolence from book asha at all i read a witty female fighting her way in a mans world i want to root for book asha i want to drown tv yara the kings landing scenes were very jumpy and felt incomplete somehow though i am glad they included varys riddle i like the vision they had with the changes on how yoren dies and arya is captured by the lannisters i just didnt like how it was filmed it was as though they filmed the entire episode and realized they ran out of money just at the end and sort of winged it with the little bit they had left in short i liked most of the changes most of the new character portrayals i just didnt like something about the direction of it all i started getting bored"
"Goreshank",2012-04-15,"gave it a 9 because there is always room to improve but overall i am very pleased with it the personal struggle for theon was excellent i just wish he had made a different decision"
"Tewks44",2012-04-15,"this episode has single handedly renewed my excitement for season 2 i thought it was a massive improvement over the first two which were to be honest a tad disappointing"
"Prince of Dragonstone",2012-04-15,"although i think the other two episodes were good this was a great episodeall the tyrion scenes per usual were excellent but i particularly loved the scene between him and cersei first time in this series that i actually felt something for the queen when i read this part in acok cersei came off as petulant bullheaded and shortsighted in tonights episode lena headey was able to go further beyond the surface and show the emotion of a mother losing her daughter to have men control your life and to not want your daughter to be treated as a show pony like she was brilliant scene just brilliant i also thought the family dinner scene with cersei her children and sansa was also subtlety brilliant the actress whos playing sansa is getting better she portrayed the scared hostage perfectly cersei was chilling as well sansa the princess spoke to you sansa will do her dutythe only thing more terrifying than a dangerous person is a dangerous and reckless person which cersei truly is between the the evil queen and the psycho fiance sansa lives in constant fear its no wonder she hasnt had a nervous breakdown yet i also really enjoyed the greyjoy scenes wowthey are really doing this storyline justice imo theon poor theon he just wants the love of his father and alfie allen is portraying that perfectly to us he plays the arrogant cad to the public but underneath it all hes just a scared little boy with abandonment issues yara asha seems much more stern and grubby than i imagined her in the books but you know what i think its actually better because the rough and ready motif goes more with the ironborn culture"
"TheTrueMithrandir",2012-04-15,"after getting the gripes out of my system after the first 2 episodes i sat back and really enjoyed the 3rd tonight"
"Dacie",2012-04-15,"9 my favorite of the season by far loved theon tyrion margrenlyloras i actually liked ashayara last episode but wasnt as crazy about this one reserving judgement i think theyre doing a great job with the wolf dreams it could look silly or cheesy if done the wrong way but they pull it off just right"
"Ororo727 Jon Snow Fangirl",2012-04-15,"would like to give it a 9 but will stay at 8 feeling the momentum starting to pick up my only real gripe is with how this show portrays shae but really only a little nitpick whore with a pointless attitudei think shaes portrayal is spot on exactly how i imagined her spoiler too bad tyrion didnt choke then and get it over with  so annoying devilgif classbbcemoticon altdevil etahad to add spoiler tags edited by ororo727 jon snow fangirl 15 april 2012  1050 pm"
"_Oberyn_",2012-04-15,"8 it was a much better episode than the other two but it still a bit more informative then anything what i loved about this episode is that even if it makes some big changes from the book eg arya it does not annoy me like the small changes in episodes 12 because it makes sense and thats what balance i think that should be kept between show and books changes are fine but no mater how big or small they have to make fucking sense also if i had to nitpick loras should have learned to pronounce his own last name properly edited by oberyn 15 april 2012  1117 pm"
"Blaer Dayle",2012-04-15,"i liked the first 2 episodes but i loved this one added scenes all felt in character sansa came off as spoiled and arrogant having grown up and wanting nothing but on realizing shae is in a similar situation she warmed up to her and tommen is the weak little boy who doesnt want to hurt even his worst enemies jaqen says a boy should help open the cage and a man can fight the scenes all served a purpose for those complaining about renlyloras the scene did show how brienne will be viewed as a member of the rainbow guard and showed that the public knows about their love and scoffs at renly as being weak for it littlefinger finally showed up as he is in the books that look when promised harrenhal and lord paramount of the trident spoke volumes on part of his character and not as the weak pointless and stupid character he has been so far this season and they managed to end the tailing gendry then suddenly he is forgottenwhat to do with aryas pointless wandering issues that would inevitably come up in great form condensing the wandering around the lake doesnt bother me at all yoren and arya was great and foreshadowed where arya is headed as a dark path with no happy ending greatly the small council deception from tyrion the reaction from cersei brienne in general and the arrest of pycelle all matched my imagination perfectly this episode has been the best this season and in at least the top 3 of the series i personally thought it was flawless 1010 from me"
"Hear Us Roar",2012-04-15,"everything was great except we did not need to have the shaesansa scene"
"Fredwin",2012-04-15,"total improvement in all aspects except as noted shae id give the other episodes a 6 or so but this was a definite 95"
"EgoistMusketeer",2012-04-15,"i thought this episode was fantastic def the best of the season so far the tyrion scenes were superb i loved the switch from pycelle to varys to littlefinger brilliant acting all around natalie dormer is fantastic and they confirm or at least hint at some mysteries from the book in the shows loras margery renly dynamic the arya scene was the show stealer as always joren was brilliant and its a shame he had to go my one complaint did they recast shagga son of dolph sadpng classbbcemoticon alt "
"Howdyphillip",2012-04-15,"10 the only reason that i dont give it an 11 is because i lost my amp"
"SFA-OK",2012-04-15,"i agree that it was the best episode so far this season still not great but an improvement ill give it a 6 looks like they cast a good actress for brienne small nitpick but i always pictured her having long hair not short maybe she had short hair in the book and i missed that actor playing theon is doing a good job same for sansa shae and asha  bad it was cool to see a lot of people in a scene for once the brienne intro"

"Robin Of House Hill",2012-04-16,"i gave it a 9 i loved this episode tyrion was outstanding brienne of tarth was a pleasant surprise the ambush of the yorens people was flawless im going to miss yoren the best episode so far"
"Envie",2012-04-16,"i gave this episode a big 10 way up there i felt all scenes were relevant and well done no wasted bits at all i especially loved tyrions test with pycelle varys and littlefinger  so well done a lot of people arent liking the change of shae becoming sansas handmaid but i actually like it they have to cut characters where they can and cutting lolly out now is probably just as well her purpose was pretty limited and pathetic as semiretarded and getting raped  pregnant and all that theyll find a different way for bronn to get his lordship and im ok with that somewhat wide deviation from the plot i liked yara better this week she still acts too sullen and broody for my tastes but if shes supposed to act and look like balons sondaughter well shes got that part down again i feel really sorry for theon hes making a difficult choice and we all know where that leads him the yoren gendry arya scene was again  very well done and so intense this time i also was ok with the loras  renly scene and felt it was important as a lead in to why renly wont do the deed with margaery i like that they added her willingness to help her king consummate the marriage with or without her brothers help haha"
"kephv",2012-04-16,"best episode of the season gave it a ten may actually be one of my favorites overall the yoren and arya scene at the end was amazing maisie williams is absolutely brilliant as was francis magee that wouldve been worth it alone oh and crossbows it takes more than arrows to stop yoren hell be missed  edited by manyfacedone 16 april 2012  1220 am"
"TeamDanyArya",2012-04-16,"excellent episode see the first two were worth the pacing to get to this one tyrion is in full pimp mode i think the scene with cersei were really good lena headley is humanizing her more than she is in the books although i expect and want full crazy once we get to season 3 and beyond until it gets reined in again the scenes at pyke were awesome i love the symbolizm with theon shot completely in the dark except for a candle i think sophie turner should get more kudos for playing sansa her performance is understated so it really makes sanda a more sympathetic character brienne was spot on i love the added scenes with loras renly and margarey loras and margarey are trying to get it through renlys head he needs to take stuff more seriously"
"Corvinus",2012-04-16,"i gave it an 8 1 for the renlyloras thing 1 for yoren being the inspiration for aryas prayer and implying that littlefinger will influence catelyns future actions"
"snowzombie",2012-04-16,"i loved the premier the second episode a bit less and this episode just wasnt doing it for me but last season the first half dragged while the last half was almost all pay off and next week is shadow baby time cannot wait jon and bran  snoozefest shae  hated it ive wanted to like yara especially since people were ragging on her for not being hot enough after seing a single screencap of her this actress does not have the charisma necessary to play the character asha was no great beauty but she had a magnetism yara is just playing balons minime balon however is excellent and theons speech to him about letting him just be taken was truly excellent the thing i am enjoying most about the show right now is all the subtlety and nuance lena headey is bringing to cersei her anger towards tyrion over mrycella was my favorite part of the episode the aryayoren scene was electric im sort of mixed on them making him the origin of the people i want to see dead prayer but i understand it was a necessity same with jaqens rescue being anticlimatic"
"salt",2012-04-16,"this was the best episode of the season so far by a long shot thank goodness it didnt suck i was starting to get worried"
"J_Crews",2012-04-16,"a lot of people arent liking the change of shae becoming sansas handmaid but i actually like it they have to cut characters where they can and cutting lolly out now is probably just as well her purpose was pretty limited and pathetic as semiretarded and getting raped  pregnant and all that theyll find a different way for bronn to get his lordship and im ok with that somewhat wide deviation from the ploteither a lot of people are forgetting or im crazy but spoiler doesnt she become sansas handmaid anyway of course thats later in the books but  to me  its only a small deviationadvancement of the story not a wide one edited by js crews 16 april 2012  0111 am"
"IronSuitor",2012-04-16,"very good episode i gave it an 8 only because i need room on the scale for even better ones the renlylorasmargaery thing is being played very well all things considered tyrions scenes were suitably brilliant theon and balons interactions are improvements on the book version imo both actors are playing the hell out of their roles and the visuals are fantastic though im not a fan of yaraasha the last scene made it for me amory lorch and crew were pitch perfect i cant wait to see harrenhall given how amazing the casting has been so far im really anticipating roose bolton and his interactions with arya"
"teemo",2012-04-16,"i really liked it there were a few awkward scenesstoryline changes like shae on fastforward and her terrible acting besides that i was very pleased love brienne the three question thing with tyrion oh and the tyrellrenlymargaery thing thats exactly how i pictured their relationship i definitely saw the queen of thorns in her then she hides it in front of sansa when we see her in the books but she is very cunning and smart"
"mrnegativity",2012-04-16,"a solid 9 only because i need somewhere to go art direction  setcostume design continues to be outstanding best examples this episode  briennes armour her sigil sapphire details margaerys dresses hot tyrions garb everything shot in pyke unreal some pretty epic editingdirecting  pycelle morphing into varys holy shit great job conveying a very important plot point developing margaerys character earlier than in the books  good option condensing aryas wandering  good option making us like yoren more before killing him  giving arya an inspiration for her prayers  good option were only going to sympathise more with arya now that yet another influential protector slash father figure has been cut down in front of her as others have pointed out the only thing that pissed me off this episode was shae but i hated her in the books so figures showing sansa to be a little bitch was an interesting one too im hohum on that but she probably needs a little depth now in order to lend weight to her developments later"
"Davos55",2012-04-16,"excellent episode i gave it a 9 theon was great in this episode and i think him burning the note and his scene with the damphair were just brilliant amazing music in the damphair scene tyrion was a boss as always though i dont know where they are headed with lf and catelyn i really liked the scene in winterfell with bran mostly because i love maester luwin summer hodor and bran yorens death was very tragic and came off better than it did in the book i was very sad to see him go but atleast he went down fighting arya was brilliant as always my only gripes were yara asha who i still do not like in the show and shae who i didnt like in the books and i hate in the show cant wait for next sunday"
"gramblor",2012-04-16,"such a great episode i can see lots of nitpickers being complainy and whining about brienne not being ugly enough i thought she was great her height and her voice and emotion was awesome plus she was uglynot really ugly but swedish ugly"
"Lord Belmore",2012-04-16,"i thought it was pretty much perfect i was gushing throughout the episode my only gripes i still think ashayara was poorly cast but i already penalized that in the last episode shae is annoying but i liked her no more in the book as such its a very small issue"
"SI Monster",2012-04-16,"just finished watching the encore at first because i was kind of busy i gave the episode an 8 i felt the scene with sansa and shae somewhat rushed and the extended scene of loras and renly sprinkled a little bit of margaery a bit unknerving again im no gaybasher but i just feel that an unkept secret is not fun and can be distracting upon second viewing i changed my vote to a solid 9 i did that mostly becuase of the scenes of pyke and the elaboration of the relationship between theon and baelon greyjoy it made me actually feel for theon even though hes one of the few characters id like to kill off as fast as possible aside from ramsay snow and props to alfie allen and patrick malahide for how they potrayed the pain and shame of their rather sticky relationship it was something that wasnt really delve into in the books that i thought really needed it imho aside from what i previously mentioned because i hate repeating myself i give it a solid 9"
"The Bastard of Bolton",2012-04-16,"no one else enjoyed jons opening scene i thought it was a great display of kits improved acting and great interaction with mormont the bran setup was nice the iron islands stuff was brilliant the further inclusion of dorne has me happy tyrion was great all his kl was spot on brienne was great and huge sansa and cersei really had me convinced i like the tyrells arya and yoren was great timmet son of timmet as shagga son of dolf have they gone fully retarded why not just keep timmet as timmet if the actor for shagga is gone i dont much care for shaes brilliance in other films when she is sucking in the show im currently watching she is much to ignorant to risk putting with sansa especially if tyrion is trying to keep her concealed her accent attitude and delivery are aggravating i was a bit bugged that cersei was almost brought to tears by sansas plight but i guess she sees herself as a young pawn best show so far 810"

"salt",2012-04-16,"theons scene burning the letter and being baptized by the priest of the drowned god wow that was downright cinematic game of thrones is the only show on tv i can think of that can pull off something like that theyre really making use of the fact that so many people are watching on hdtvs these days the quality was like something out of a ridley scott film had anyone walked in the room at that scene they would have thought for sure i was watching a movie and not a television show"
"Stannis is the Mannis",2012-04-16,"8 best of the season so far a lot of good moments and very few i had a problem with the bedroom scene with renly went on a little long time that could have been better spent elsewhere also i found the continuation of the craster cliffhanger to be very anticlimactic there was no need to even have craster catch jon they could have just left willingly seems like they mostly just wanted to force a cliffhanger onto the end of ep 2 but it really didnt lead anywhere significant the scenes with theon and the greyjoys were great and the scenes at renlys camp as well all in all a very solid episode however one side comment about the season as a whole so far the lack of characterization for the dragonstone crew so far has been a little disappointing many characters cut out entirely and very little back story on davos and stannis so far these are relatively important characters and after 30 of the season i expected a little bit more to be invested in them a few scenes this episode to develop character could have gone a long way"
"PatrickStormborn",2012-04-16,"i gave it a 9 the same as last week there were a couple of moments where i thought the writing was a bit off but other than that i thought it was fantastic  particularly the arya scenes if im being honest though i think the lack of daenerys really affected this episode at least well see some advancement in her story next weekand i dont quite understand the hatred of shae shes a much more interesting character than she was in the books and the actress is doing a fantastic job i gave it an 81 for the renlyloras thing1 for yoren being the inspiration for aryas prayer and implying that littlefinger will influence catelyns future actions 1 for a scene that advanced the plot oh dear"
"The Bastard of Bolton",2012-04-16,"huh i must have missed that partit looked like she was touched by sansa in that scene between her myrcella and tommen she is still being a bitch but it felt like at some moment she was feeling a bit human might just be how i saw it"

"JW.",2012-04-16,"good episode huge step up from the last one for sure solid 810 brienne lived up to the hype although she only had a few lines sadly alfie allen is just so great as theon that amazing scene when he is yelling at his father awesome first well done nonbook added scene of the season so far tyrion and how he exposed the rat in the small council well done aswell maisie as arya continues to be amazing she really is the most talented of the kid actors on this show that whole last scene with yoren and the aftermath was wonderfully done also happy we didnt see any brothel scenes ofcourse we did have nudity but for once hbo did it with some class shocking stuff i didnt like i hate shae im not sure if its the actress or the lines she is given but why the f would tyrion risk his neck for the likes of her in the books she comes of as sweet and caring for tyrion here not so much and yet again the complete lack of subletly in the show but it seems we will have to get used to it edited by jw 16 april 2012  0500 am"

"Howland Reed",2012-04-16,"i gave it a solid 8 would have gone 85 if the option was available pros  i thought theon did a fantastic job his sister on the other hand is just not how i imagined her but im sure her personality will play out soon enough theon is killing it though i tip my hat to him when he burned that letter i was like shit if only i could tell you what is to come  tyrions scene with little fingerpycellevarys i thought they made that scene very well im sure there are more but those two really stood out for me when recalling the episode cons  a lot of people hating on shae i would have to agree to an extent her character just seems a bit different than how i saw her in the book she seems like a huge biatch in the show like she runs the place it wasnt a make or break thing for me  renlylorasmarg i just did not know how to perceive that whole scene seemed a bit strange to me i see where they are going with it marg seems a bit more conniving than i ever expected but thats just my opinion all in all i love the book so much that i appreciate anything even remotely following the story and honestly i couldnt even fathom making a show out of it and these guys are doing a great job at it also brienne was casted well love that character one last thing biterrorge dont seem nearly as intimidating as i always thought they were they seems like normal people where as i always imagined them as these big burly vile cruel mtherfckers just my take sorry maybe i posted this in the wrong forum edited by howland reed 16 april 2012  0719 am"

"bikie",2012-04-16,"9 loved the addition of margaerys complexity and brienne was spot on the editing of tyrion planting his seeds was brilliant the note from theon gave him the initial sympathy i was surprised the books never conveyed to me my only complaint though i understand why it had to be excluded was arya getting some kills yelling winterfell and then the classic hot pie response perhaps later on they will work it in"
"Qhorin Halfhand and Yoren",2012-04-16,"8510 by far my favorite episode of the season i voted for 910 as it is closer to that than 8 for me mostly for these theon greyjoy scenes yoren and arya scenes tyrion scenes other than his scene with shae most of the rest was not bad there were somewhat good scenes too but the above are my highlights and pretty great shaes scenes are my least favorite edited by qhorin halfhand and yoren 16 april 2012  0841 am"
"Greyjoy67",2012-04-16,"9 whereas ep1 and 2 were 8 the increase in action is appreciated because it helps move the episodes along there was so many memorable scenes in that one  the tyrion games bran being told magic doesnt exist foreshadowing shiii theon going ape margaery being hot  renly and catalyns conversation and briennes stuff and of course a terrific closing scene i love the way they had yoren and aryas dialogue and then quickly cut away to his death"

"Reposado",2012-04-16,"easily best of the season for all of the reasons that have been mentioned the scene which cuts the three tyrion conversations was fantastic the one things that show the limitations of the project is that the running jokes are undercut by the fact that they are no longer running tyrion telling shagga to cut off pycelles manhood and feed it to the goats isnt funny if we havent heard shagga say it more than once lommy yielding is only funny if he keeps yielding even in ridiculous situations"

"Tadco26",2012-04-16,"gave it a 7 much better than last weeks which was my least favorite overalllikestyrions tests and confrontations with varys littlefinger and pycelle cersei and tyrionbrienne and the renly story line thise episode in general i know some really disliked the sexual part but honestly i thought it felt the most natural and least sexpostion like so far not that i ever want to watch men make out but at least the conversations felt natural and were plot related brienne looks perfect and though she seems a bit over confident i will reserve judgement thereyoren was good though i am not totally a fan of his last scene more details belowtheon was greatbrans wolf dreams were nicely done something that could easily be handled terribly but we see thru summers eyes as the wolf jumps on the bed and wakes brandislikesyara hasnt lived up to expectations so far still early but she just seems sullen and angry so far none of the bravado of the book version who is completely at home with the men she has fought with perhaps the problem is that they havent given her any other iron born besides her father and theon to interact withshae of all the tv characters she is the furthest from the book version and frankly it is hard to imagine why tyrion would be attached to her i think ros for all her flaws as a character who gets too much screen time in proportion to her importance much better fits the book version of shae book shae was sweet and flirtatious to the extreme and always wanted to be with tyrion but the tv version is a bitch more often than not and there is no chemistry or sweetness for us to think tyrion would risk everything for her instead of just finding any other whore in kings landingits hard to believe that amory lorch would be specifically looking for gendry by name and know about his helm but wouldnt know that all of roberts bastards have dark hair meaning that the blond lommy could not possibly be gendrybeyond that i thought yoren was a bit suicidal attacking all those lannisters alone and not having arya gendry hot pie and lommy escape was a bit disappointing i can understand the compression and it isnt a huge negative to me but i cant call it perfect either it was at best acceptable due to budget restrictionsnot sure i like the implication that littlefinger is going to be the one that convinces catelyn to release jaime lannister its a bit of a reach to think that tyrion would even know catelyn was visiting renly so quickly much less get that information and have time for littlefinger to travel there before catelyn leaves againwith such limited screen time for sansa im not convinced being catty with shae was a good choice if there was 1214 episodes for this season it would be trivial but the length of that scene was equivalent to the amount of time spent on 12 chapters worth of events for other charactersother thoughts im really curious as to what role ros is supposed to fill now at the start of the season there was much speculation on her replacing chataya andor alayaya but they appear to be skipping over the whole tyrion sneaking out to see shae story line making both of those characters unnecessary anyway the show still has some really great moments but 10 episodes really is leaving a lot of the story line on the cutting floor and gives the feeling of watching a cliff notes version of the real story with some questionable changes thrown in for good measure i dont hate it by any means but i dont love it as much as i would like to"
"SerArthurHeath",2012-04-16,"how was sansa even being catty with shae no way any character especially a noble would have accepted her incompetence and lack of courtesy sansa wasnt horrible enough if anything even without allowing for the horrible situation she is in and the conversation she has just been in"

"Lors' Edrick",2012-04-16,"the best episode so far mind you we only have two others to go on but otherwise very nicely done especially with the switch of tyrion to pycelle to varys to littlefinger scenes in adition brienne of tarth is amazing her towering presence is just like the books described her now some say she is still not as ugly as she should be but recall that her brudish ways and gangly appearance also play into people looking at her as an unbeauty"

"packersfan",2012-04-17,"number 1 reason i think this episode is the best so far no wasted fking scenes i mean i dont recall there being so many sex scenes in the book just for the sake of a sex scene the first two episodes were plagued by this horny need to have the brothel featured littlefingers conversation with ros a complete waste of time and not even in the book this episode the only sex scenes were with renly to remind of his homosexual relationship with lorasis that in the book i cant remember and to bring that question of margareys viginity that is a big deal in later books winkpng classbbcemoticon alt  my tip to the producers directors creators of this show stick to the booksdont add in extra sex scenes just for the sake of sex scenesthe show could have absolutely zero sex and would still be great stick with martins sex scenes and you will be golden since those actually move the plot forward in some way i gave this episode a 810 we finally got some real action i loved tyrions scene with pyrcell littlefinger and varysat first when varys popped up i thought tyrion got caught in the act but then i remembered that tyrion was throwing different stories out to the untrusted others to catch the leak loved pyrcell getting grabbed up just like in the bookexcept we didnt see him piss himself haha isnt it a little early in the story for shae to be sansas handmaid wasnt she a handmaid for some other noble first and live in her own secret mansion and have that singer that tyrion eventually had turned into stew i suppose they have to condenseand all those things are not absolutely necessary to move the story alongas long as eventually shaes identity is discovered etc etc this episode showed the potential and brought back memories of the first season 810remember less sex is better if we wanted porn we would just watch porn"

"TeamDanyArya",2012-04-17,"i think it is the writing more than his acting they have made him a blunt micromanaging pimp rather than a subtle threat and master mind behind the scenes likewise with shae i dont think it is the actress fault so much as the writing no actress can act like she is loving towards tyrion or seductive if the majority of her lines are her complaining attacking him for some imagined wrong or otherwise acting like a bitchshes like that in the book though shes nothing but a spoiled whore plain and simple and tyrion is stupid enough to have genuine feelings for her"

"teemo",2012-04-16,"he was just doing that to test out the three council members whose loyalties he doubted im pretty sure he just made up that theon story out of thin air this is actually what happened in the book not really much of a spoiler but just in case spoiler he told pycelle he was sending myrcella to dorne and told varys he was sending theon to dorne in the books he told the same thing to pycelle but to varys i think he said he was sending away both tommen and myrcella i think they changed it to theon in the show to make it a little less confusing i think it may have had the opposite effect however"
"teamocil",2012-04-16,"yes that was a pretty neat trick he pulled tyrion is pretty awesome i really enjoyed his conversation with varys about the nature of power well there were lots of things i really enjoyed about this show in spite of its tendency to kill off characters i like okay thanks for the clarifications now off to bed"

"Xtopher",2012-04-16,"tyrion knows for a fact that balon greyjoy hates the starks because they defeated the greyjoys actually humiliated and massacred during robertâs rebellion thats why balon had to bend the knee and accept robert as king and give his son theon to the starks balon has always hated the starks for it so tyrionâs idea to marry myrcella to theon was actually pretty clever"
"_Oberyn_",2012-04-16,"actually all the starks did was take theon balon oldest son was killed at seaguard and the mallisters are tully bannermen the other one was killed during the colapse of the first tower in the siege of pyke the fleet was destroyed by stannis the attack on pyke was a joined effort and any atrocities were most likely committed by the lannisters to retaliate for the attack on lanisport"

"NW Deserter",2012-04-16,"i dont know if i agree about him being unsympathetic in the books it took a reread for me to really see it but even when hes taking winterfell hes constantly racked with guilt about what hes doing and trying to rationalize to himself that its the right thing to do the biggest different in the show is just how early on we sympathize with him it takes til dance to really get to that point in the novels because of scenes like this which i think is okay because it almost makes the viewers feel conflicted as well it will make his actions later this season be both despicable and understandableidk if any of yall watch larry williams otakuassemble reviews but hes only watching the series without ever looking at the books and was a huge stark fan but in his review this past week he even admits that he already feels torn on how to feel about theon because he loves the greyjoys"
"Ran",2012-04-16,"booktheon is a man who betrays his foster family without hesitation or regretif you pay attention to his later chapters in acok youll know thats wrongthe theon in the novel starts off as very unreflective while being a moral coward we do not see what follows between the first and second chapter  its likely he did think a little but he goes where the wind blows taking the path of least resistance its only once hes buried in the mire of his own betrayal that the cracks show and you realize that this was all a horrible petty mistake that happens because of that moral cowardice of histhe thing is grrm can easily do this  he can mask that part of the story and only bring it out later while were in his head and we start seeing the regret and shame seep in through the cracks they cant put us directly into theons head however in the same way hence this wonderful scene which externalizes the struggle where it most makes senseits a medium thing they take different approaches  they frontload it grrm puts it at the tail end  but the result is the same fantastically complex charactersof course sometimes they front load too damned much"
"The Monkey",2012-04-16,"alfie allen was brilliant in this episode never really payed much attention to him in the past agrees with you all that it was done better than in the novels the part where he confronts his father about being sent off to winterfell was utterly heartbreaking and one i missed from the books tvtheon is starting to become one of the more complex characters on the show"
"wolverine",2012-04-16,"just wanted to add that i thought theons betrayal was handled perfectly the only thing i am questioning is was balon even planning on taking winterfell in the book or just raiding like a viking it seems theon really stepped up his betrayal in his attack on winterfell"
"Strider",2012-04-16,"if you pay attention to his later chapters in acok youll know thats wrongthe theon in the novel starts off as very unreflective while being a moral coward we do not see what follows between the first and second chapter  its likely he did think a little but he goes where the wind blows taking the path of least resistance its only once hes buried in the mire of his own betrayal that the cracks show and you realize that this was all a horrible petty mistake that happens because of that moral cowardice of histhe thing is grrm can easily do this  he can mask that part of the story and only bring it out later while were in his head and we start seeing the regret and shame seep in through the cracks they cant put us directly into theons head however in the same way hence this wonderful scene which externalizes the struggle where it most makes senseits a medium thing they take different approaches  they frontload it grrm puts it at the tail end  but the result is the same fantastically complex charactersof course sometimes they front load too damned muchi agree that in the later books after enduring unspeakable torture theonreek begins to express a small measure of regret sorrow perhaps even a little repentance and he does show a modicum of loyalty by keeping secret the fact that bran and rickon are alive but is there any textual evidence that suggests that he was actually conflicted about betraying robb and the starks initially my recollection is that it was a pretty easy decision for him he is upset to discover that his father does not trust him and that he has been usurped by his sister but are there any indications that he feels any pains of conscience when he allies himself with his fathers plans perhaps there are its easy to forget or overlook these kinds of details in the books my impression of theon is that he is driven by ambition lust and a desire to prove himself to his father breaking vows and bonds of affection and loyalty seem to come easy to him i cannot see booktheon ever composing a letter of warning to robb it is only later after his education at the hands of ramsay bolton that he begins to evidence something akin to remorse at least that is my recollection perhaps im wrong"

"snax",2012-04-16,"considering how theon had thus far acted like a twat to people around him this helped add complexity to his character and make him more sympathetic plus itll help make his remorse later feel more real"
"House Martell",2012-04-16,"i think the tv writers have done a good job of showing a more realistic struggle with certain characters theon here with the letter and cat last week with going to renly instead of returning to winterfell and her children in both cases in the books i never really bought the decisions it made them both seems evil or unfeeling while the tv show has shown the struggle and difficulty with which the characters come to their decisions"

"TerraPrime",2012-04-16,"of course sometimes they front load too damned muchi feel that way about this tvtheon i think theon was characterized by a sort of shortsighted selfishness and an overblown idea of his own merits only to have those shattered bit by bit adding this reflection and loyalty piece marred that part of the characterization i understand why the tv show has to do it and i think it was a good addition but i also think it changes the trajectory of the character a slight bit"

"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2012-04-16,"yeah this idea this is was handled better in the tv series than the books is just bogus if you were paying close attention in the theons chapters you can detect all the inner struggles its just much more subtle which the tv series is bringing to the forefront more which is a great decision because you have to revels things differently in a tv show than a book since you cant go inside a characters head in a tv show so i think the scenes they added were great theon was always one of my favorite characterizations in the books noticed i said characterization not character because that inner struggle i found fascinating and really i find all the people who say they found so and so unsympathetic in the books are really more a failure of the reader than the author because grrm gives almost every character some reason to for sympathetic i never understood how people could find cat and sansa unsympathetic heck i was sympathetic to a point with chett and pate and he gave them both only 1 prologue chapter each edited by the scabbard of the morning 16 april 2012  0430 pm"

"LuisDantas",2012-04-17,"tv theon looks pretty much the same as he is portrayed in the books to me i loved the letter because it was needed to make it sothere is a good illustration of some theory or another about psychological conflict and the influence of external acceptance in the formation of personality despicable as his actions to come are theon lacks much of a choice he has been denied an identity and spent the last ten years desperately and pointlessly begging for the integration he so sorely needs it is interesting that his native culture brags of refusing to sow and worships a drowned god because theon is indeed lacking in roots reserves and breathing space essentialy he is being pushed by everyone who is suposed to care for him and therefore forced to live in constant panic that is why ramsay affects him so deeplyi wonder how i will feel later on when he turns against the likes of rodrick cassel"

"TeamDanyArya",2012-04-17,"i think when the writers have added stuff like theons letter his speech to balon some of cerseis dialogue in season 1 lorasrenly etc is to hint at whats to come should future seasons happen and to play up on what they as readers got out of the books we all interpret things differently also because you are translating essentially a book into a visual you lose a lot of exposition and internal dialogue so we have to see things we get dialogue that can come off as stupid or out of character this is a generalization im making i dont know if they are quite trying to make theon more likable but i think when we get to what he does later on itll have a much more emotional impact on the audience"

"FloredaA",2012-04-25,"code in the book when theon shows up at winterfell to take it youre like wtf is he doing code i agree they shouldnt have made balon talk about seizing castles particularly winterfell iirc in the books he says hes only interested in taking control of the coasts of the north  which they can actually control from pyke theons move against winterfell is supposed to be his own supposedly brilliant addition to the scheme and were spoiled the suprise that hell dare and succeed this i never had any trouble understanding theons change of loyalties in the books hes in fact fairly constant  hes highly selfcentered and egoist and he desperately wants to belong and be recognized where most people try to belong by sharing affections love and be loved he seems unable to love anybody but himself thats probably due to the fact that the greyjoy are not a very loving family to begin with in fact a deeply disturbed family is more like it and he was outcast of it he was too old to learn affection with the starks plus his hostage status meant ned and cat couldnt love him like a son  they were supposed to kill him in case balon rebelled again and we know cat is not very good at loving children other than her own he doesnt reflect much on feelings nor morals and mainly goes with the flow of events as long as it seems to push him on top when hes with the starks he wants to be appreciated by the starks but doesnt understand their familial love and loyalty remember the episode where he saves bran from the wildlings hes not afraid to put him in danger as long as he can show his archers skills and expects to be congratulated for his shot instead of scolded by robb and when he gets to the iron islands he wants to belong with his old family and never stops to contemplate the contradiction in fact he already believes himself a kings heir because of robbs plan and then grabs onto balons plan as a way to keep that position"

"Envie",2012-04-16,"ps great commentary by the producers in this video inside the episode just postedhttpwwwyoutubectureplppvideothey really do show how artistically dramatic that scene with theons baptism by sea water was meant to be the tangible longing on theons face in contrast to the hard bitter faces of the ironborn shrouded in steel grays stormy blues of the sea the sky etc it was amazingly powerful"
"The Bastard of Bolton",2012-04-16,"so youd be perfectly happy if the ironborn attacked the westerlands killing and raping hundreds but not the northnot sure where that was derived fromi just like that they at least made an effort to portray that theon was tortured by this decision and that there was a lot of emotions and confusion involvedwho can imagine what is like to be taken away as a boy the starks were great to him but still he always knew he was just a hostage"

"Dr. Pepper",2012-04-16,"from an emotional perspective theon nowhere near my favorite character of the books from a literary perspective his pov chapters are my absolute favorites his storyline is such a tragic arc that really explores the issues of a person with a fractured identity theon is neither stark nor ironborn no man truly claims him as a son no family truly trusts him whichever side he takes he will be betraying one family or the other he was taken hostageward so long ago that he can be seen as suffering from the most horrible case of stockholm syndrome and as he said in the show none of it was actually his fault and neither family acknowledges that he is truly a sympathetic character everything they put into his scenes on the show are what i imagine happened in the skipped weeks in the books there are so many subtle hints in his acok chapters to suggest the internal struggles he has when hes made to choose who he will be and ultimately which family he will support im glad they were explicit with make him sympathetic for the tv audience because i think that part of his character is often overlooked in the books i got choked up watching alfie perform theon so glad each scene is short because a few seconds longer and i would have been bawling"

"Dr. Pepper",2012-04-16,"re the explicitness of certain things in the show it has to be explicit for a tv audience especially since the characters storylines being debated never had a pov nor did they have someone watching while they were doing the dirty in a recent interview grrm agreed with how explicit dd are being with some characters and he also listed a few future things that will need to be explicitly shown in the show such as the frey pies because there is no real useful way to subtly show them i imagine if we had a renly or loras pov wed get a sex scene in the books we had one mel pov but she even stated outright that she and stannis shared a bed i suppose he could have gone a step further and had her flashback to every part of the sex scene but that would have been ridiculous as shed stated to davos and jon that she and stannis did the dirty the biggest difference is how we assume stannis came around to having sex with mel"

"Dr. Pepper",2012-04-16,"envie i get what you are saying and i agree that it was somewhat shocking when the show was so explicit i think the point the rest of us are trying to make is that there was no way for these particular sex scenes to be explicit because these characters werent pov characters and no pov character was in the room with them when they were getting it on it makes more sense to show instead of tell on tv these sexual relations do become important in the books the lannisters accept the tyrells claim that marg is a virgin without having her examined by a septon the only conclusion is that its widely known in court that renly and loras were lovers if the courtiers had no idea that renly was gay marg would have had her maidenhead tested does homosexual sex bother you in general this is a genuinely curious question and im not trying to be judgmental at all i admit that i very much support gay rights but i did feel a tad uncomfortable seeing two men getting it on on tv since its not something i see or talk about on a daily basis"
"bloocanary",2012-04-16,"ok im going with envie on this i dont mind the lr sex scenes in and of themselves because omg hot it did however take some getting used to having it shown to us rather than hinted at martin never explicitly detailed that rl and ms had sex it was definitely alluded to but never outright witnessed by any of the pov characters the exception being mels reveal that her beds been empty in dance but thats 4 books away from when its revealed in the show and so subtle you might miss it that ms had sex wasnt confirmed until dwd so lets not act like it was spelled out for us all along i like that we had to wait for confirmation whereas theres no real mystery for those watching the show sure mel tells davos she and stannis had sex but davos doesnt trust a word mel says so why should we shadow stannis could easily have been conceived by some sort of nonsex magic my only beef with the lr scene is that their relationship was incidental to the story in the books but in the show its become their story arcs major plot point in the book renlys role is that of a formidable challenger to the throne with one of the best knights in the realm as part of his personal guard that he and loras are a couple isnt confirmed until after hes dead its secondary in the miniseries renly is one half of the shows token gay couple first and oh yeah hes doing some war stuff too i understand why theyre doing it and why they arent following the strict pov rules of the book but it is a little jarring to have something subtly and gradually revealed in the books revealed so early and blatantly in the show"
"bloocanary",2012-04-16,"these sexual relations do become important in the books the lannisters accept the tyrells claim that marg is a virgin without having her examined by a septon the only conclusion is that its widely known in court that renly and loras were lovers if the courtiers had no idea that renly was gay marg would have had her maidenhead testednot necessarily 1 i remember there being a convenient excuse that renly was so busy with preparing for war that he didnt have time to bed margaery and 2 i think that excuse was accepted so readily by the lannisters because they needed the tyrell money and support i wouldnt be surprised if the lannisters helped come up with that explanation for margaerys virginity to ensure that the marriage would be accepted without fuss"

"Brucolac",2012-04-17,"her opening line when she was cheering for loras was so horrible but i like dormer in the tudors and she seemed okay after that it makes sense to cast her with an older actress and of questionable morality since hbo does like to show sex possibly she will be the one scheming instead of her grandmother in season three as well it seems like many other characters are getting combined and that would be an easy one to do edited by brucolac 17 april 2012  0116 am"
"Hear Us Roar",2012-04-17,"youre twisting what i said i never said i didnt realize renly is gay from the books i said it wasnt written explicitly like it is in the show renly never had multiple sex scenes in the book with loras never even kissed him or flirted or came close to it  so dont even try to say the book was as obvious as what were watching repeatedly with sex scenes on the series my point in saying that was to show how over the top obvious they play some things which in turn can translate to far more revealing and sexy costumes and behaviors from other characters like melisandre and now margaeryshow me where in the text of the book this is spelled out and ill agree with you a little more that readers should realize renly was gay but not everyone didrenly is not a pov character we have no idea what he did when he was off scene in the books the tv show follows him when he is off book so of course it will show us what he is really like"

"Mulled Wino",2012-04-17,"dormer is perfect for the role as margery was portrayed in the show whether that was by design before she was cast or they decided to give her more of a player type role after they cast her is unclear in the books by this point we have no inkling of her being any more than a pretty girl from a powerful family she definitely grew into a player in the books but this seems a tad early for whatever reason"

"Envie",2012-04-17,"my previous argument to which i left some sarcasm behind is not that i disbelieved loras and renly were gay there are others like tcchaos above who may still feel they werent written that way my argument was while yes it was implicitly written in the books it was nowhere like the scenes in the series and that theres a huge difference in subtlety that the producers seem to feel was necessary to hit you over the head with a bat could it have been revealed that renly was gay and having an affair with loras without the graphic sex scene sure would that have been exciting hbo typical drama no i merely try to defend those who have a hard time grappling with the implicit hints in the book because theyre shocked by the scenes in the series its a big huge swing in the pendulum im actually surprised or maybe i shouldnt be that martin is ok with it being so bluntly exposed but again sex sells"

"jblair",2012-04-17,"margaery in the books was always a fully confident selfassured woman that was her presentation from the start do you assume that shes oblivious to politics because shes nice to people and she doesnt overtly take advantage of everyone around heron the one hand its perfectly reasonable for margaery to actually be a nice person who doesnt take advantage of people and still be a politician with clout just because you try to take care of yourself and your family doesnt mean that you need to beat everyone down around you while doing iton the other hand it might all just be an act where margaery has found that the best way to win allies and hold power is to be loved by the people around you it doesnt matter too much because we dont know at this point either way the end results are the sameas far as sex and childbearing goes everything that margaery says in the show other than lancel helping out is pure common sense and would be understood by everyone in westeros marriage isnt about love between men and women of noble birth in that society i take her dialogue with renly as a reminder to the audience of how things workim not surprised that some people have a hard reaction to this because a lot of people have very little knowledge of medieval society but i would hope that people realize thats the way things worked back then rather than assume something negative about margaery the real problem is if the viewers cant identify with the reality of the time marriages were used mostly as alliances between families children were more important than love and happiness between the parents and affairs were expected and more or less condoned since husband and wife werent married for love anyways im sure that a lot of the issues people have with characters in the book stem from ignorance of those basic principlesi agree with this margaery is the total package from the start she was presented as savvy clever confident charmingasallhell and wise to the game that doesnt mean shes an immoral or amoral as the case may be conniver like most of the other successful players its not like westeros offers us only two choices the goodnaive axis and the evilplayer axis i believe that margaery is one of the truly effective players with a good heart the only immoral act im not referring to sexual escapades i can recall is presumably being in on joffreys death but i consider that more of a preemptive family strike than an assassination joff was going down for certain but she didnt let herself get caught up as collateral damage or as his victim margaery in the books certainly steals tommens affectionsbut from a completely vile paranoid person who had already created one absolute monstrosity she does seem genuinely interested in tommens welfare and happiness the fact that he will potentially be her king someday merely aligns both her pragmatism and her morals"

"brena",2012-04-17,"i personally adore tvmargaeryfor some reason when reading the books i imagined her to be just like she is on the show seemingly innocent and sweet in public but actually a clever crafty young queenofthornsgrandchild who can hold her own in the game i even imagined her older then shes described as i just couldnt manage her as a teen when reading so obviously her portrayal on tv fits perfectly and i didnt get the shocks that other posters hadto posters who find her drastically different from the books id just like to point out that she is very different when shes alone with renly behind closed doors behind closed tent flap but in public shes the perfect courteous noble lady just like in the booksmy only issue with the tvmargaery is not her character its her dresses i have to say that i find them weird not because of the cleavage and its a minor issue its just the overall look i dont know i kinda imagined highgarden fashion to be more lavish luxurious opulent costly i get the feeling they designed her dressed to show the reach as more warm liberated and adventurous while keeping a look distinct from kings landing and from across the narrow sea maybe its just me but it doesnt scream rich lush flowery highgarden to me i expected something in the same style as loras very frilly shirt and armor so im slightly put offabout the queen of thorns i really wished wed see her but from a storytelling point of view it would be a bad idea to have her on the tv show too much content for 10 episodes too many characters to keep track of more scenes needed for margaery while we get her importance in the books she only has 23  scenes and considering how theyve expanded margaery and loras for the show it would make more sense to split the qots aspects between them"

"Ser McGuire",2012-04-19,"hi all i was pretty impressed with both the adapted writing for the character of margaery and by the way that natalie dormer delivered the role ive read the books several times and while i look for the tv show to follow the main arcs in the books i dont look for all the details to be the same in fact i look forward to the differences to see how theyre going to achieve similar results in a different way to me the character of margaery in this episode has very quickly been established as intelligent politically aware cunning ruthless astute uninhibited when need be practical and has shown us a number of insights both into her and the tyrells as a family and whats expected of her all in under five minutes she showed her social and political skills as a queen by immediately observing the correct forms with catelyn stark then she followed it up with a blatant and unashamed seduction knowing it would fail but allowing her to broach a delicate subject with her husband by neatly backing renly into a corner and confronting him about his sexuality or reluctance to engage into a sexual relationship with her she has established herself to him as immediately trustworthy and capable of discretion as an ally and as someone who will do whatever it takes to make things work with her king she has also shown us the viewers that she knows what shes doing before she does it you could see that the whole scenario wasnt improvised wasnt a blurted response but was calm reasoned and for want of a better word manipulative personally after seeing barely five minutes of margaery tyrell in the tv adaptation im really looking forward to seeing her more in kings landing im looking forward to her interactions with joffrey and sansa but most of all with cersei especially when they start bickering over tommen she already reminds me of what a younger cersei lannister may have been like however she hasnt exhibited signs of the impulsive arrogant and thoughtless behaviour that are some of cerseis hallmarks as for the speculation about inclusion in the future for the qot thats up to the people who make the show but which ever way they decide to go i already have the impression that margaery wont be out of her depth when she gets to kings landing an elder advisor and tutor with her own games could really add depth but if they choose to go without i dont think it will make margaery look any weaker as a character ser mcguire"

"teemo",2012-04-20,"i think it will be strange to see a 30 year old woman marrying a what10 year old even though shes not actually playing a 30 year old she still looks her age margaery definitely doesnt look like shes almost out of her childbearing years but yeaha little bizarre her and joffrey is weird enough"
"The Greatmatt",2012-04-20,"felt the need to jump in and say that absolutely loved the bedroom scene and everything it said about margaerys character in the books they leave a lot about her character ambiguous and while that can be a good thing its never a bad thing to get more of the blanks filled in revealing a compelling character typically when we talk about moral ambiguity we talk about the good guys doing bad things a far more interesting version of it though is when a character does things that immediately make the audience groan thats just wrong but which really dont need to have any such reaction what margaery displays here is basically that shes going to be the most supportive queen renly could possibly ask for shes hurting no one and so really we the audience are the ones with the issue great stuff definitely stole the episode"
"Hear Us Roar",2012-04-20,"they should have made the tommen and mycella older tommen looks like he is 6 on the show"

"brena",2012-04-20,"she looks younger than renly not that it matters but i would say they were going for an 1922 year old look for her shes built slight enough and again pixie young face even so a 20something queen is going to look odd next to a 1014 year old tommen even if hes been aged up a bit by then its not completely out of the question and in the model time period of the genre perfectly normali think it will be strange to see a 30 year old woman marrying a what10 year old even though shes not actually playing a 30 year old she still looks her age margaery definitely doesnt look like shes almost out of her childbearing years but yeaha little bizarremargaerys age difference with tommen is a little weird even in the books shes his bigger sister not really his wifeand i agree with envie regardless of dormers real age she looks very young due to her elfique features and shes definitly presented as being younger then renlyalso from what weve seen so far they seem to emphasis the changes of maturity in some characters by aging them significantly just compare photos from season 1 and season 2 of robb loras and renly for best exemples they look like they aged 10 years mostly because in season 1 they were made to look much younger then the actors real age they might do something similar with tommen too edited by brena 20 april 2012  0845 am"
"Hyper",2012-04-20,"margaerys age difference with tommen is a little weird even in the books shes his bigger sister not really his wifeand i agree with envie regardless of dormers real age she looks very young due to her elfique features and shes definitly presented as being younger then renlyi was very concerned about dorners age when she was cast i had not seen her in much before  but i think she is coming across as much younger than i expected she can pass for someone in their early twenties  no problem imoand i agree the margerytommen union was a bit extreme in the books as well but i think the tommen actor in two years will make the difference less extreme than it would appear like now"
"Ghost714",2012-04-20,"there is nothing weird about margaery being married to tommen in westeros i think natalie dormer looks way younger than she is and the show made her look even younger i would say she is not over 20 based off of her looks and stuff in the show remember in westeros we had people like jon arryn being married to lysa tully he was older than her dad and he looked it there is no way margaery looks older than robert or even jaime let alone her actually being younger with that said i absolutely loved natalie dormer as margaery i could very easily see them cutting olenna tyrell from the show and if they do i am fine with it because natalie dormer can easily pull off both characters i do not understand why so many people are freaking out at the possibility of olennas character being cut she really is not that big of a character and i dont know why so many people have blown her way out of proportion some one even said earlier in the thread that its ok to cut the reeds but not olenna because their role is much smaller than olennas frankly i think that is crazy talk jojen and meera are much bigger characters than olenna tyrell even as individual characters they are bigger in the books let alone both of the characters so if we are going to accept the reeds being gone all together then i am fine with olennas character being wrapped into margaerys because natalie dormer did an amazing job i am really so confused on how the show can do such amazing casting with margaery arya sansa stannis davos melisandre jon etc and then do such a god awful job at casting yara because she is the worst casted character so far in the show for having a fairly big role in the story edited by ghost714 20 april 2012  0556 pm"

"digiFemme",2012-04-22,"i had my reservations about dormer playing margaery certainly it wasnt how i and a lot of other people imagined the character from the books but now that ive seen the whole renlylorasmargaery scene i can understand the changes they made i guess they wanted someone older and more world weary to go toe to toe with cersei later on and it wouldve looked more believable for a woman of closer age and experience it also accounts for her sexiness funny because i was quite annoyed with her over the top sexy act in the tudorsbut this very thing somehow works for me better in gotwhats even more strange is that i can actually imagine her even more with tommen now that the character is being played by an older woman yes because she is an older woman and almost a mother figure i could very well see tommen being swayed by her it is squicky that she happens to be his wife but ironically also another mother figure in his life because of her age and thus a threat to cersei on that level too that she is good at convincing people like renly shows shell be good in handling tommen and getting him on her side yes my dear tommen if you want to play with your crayons then you shall youre a king and no one can tell you otherwiseeven your mother"
"addie",2012-04-22,"my two cents on maergery  pro  i love the way they extend her role i was wondering wether we will see more of her as in the book she is just mentionned once and dont do much i dont know how far they will go with her during the season but she shows an interesting game in her conversation with renly con she was supposed to be a 16 year old maid remmeber  she is just 3 years older than sansa and her behaviour with loras is problematic i read soimoewhere in this thread cheesy softporn and i deeply agree this scene seems to be taken of a bad blue movie i dont believe any 16 year old maid would behave like this unless she has had some experience and this raises questions on the coming events this portrayal of maergery raises doubts on her virginity and questions the coming plot with cersei in affc i am generally speaking fed up with hbo sexy treatment of the show i know it is supposed to help to keep the attention of the viewer while explaining some important point but come on people are not that dumb are they "

"Nebmai",2012-04-17,"it was epic although i liked the situation of the fight more in the book in the episode it was clearly 100 suicide to fight and nearly guaranteed they would get gendry anyway whereas in the book they were inside a holdfast and though it was dangerous to fight the situation wasnt quite as dire but yeah he did go out like a boss at least and it was cool to see an old nw vet show what he was made of they havent really shown much how badass of fighters the nw can be yet just shown them as grizzled old guys or newbies"

"packersfan",2012-04-17,"yeah i didnt understand the running out of the holdfast but the ensuing badass last stand was great as for yoren being too soft towards arya i think it was finesince everyone else was asleephis mission with her was not to take her to the wall but to take her to winterfell he knew who she was the gruffness we saw in the book and season 1 was his way to get her to stay in character as a boy and always seemed to be in view of others while the conversation did not happen in the book i think it is believable it isnt like they hugged and when he finished he laughed about how his story of revenge will help her sleep haha i think yoren gives us a real sense of the brutal world they live in the good guys are not all pacifist perfectly moral clean peoplethey are rough and have to be to survive good point eogh i couldnt remember if amory and his men were just passing or not why did they attack in the book was it because yoren was not willing to give up the holdfast i do remember feeling that the shows depiction was not following what i read in the book i dont remember an instant ok boys these guys want to kill us lets kill them first"
"boojam",2012-04-17,"i wanted to call it yorens last stand but that might have been a bit too revealing for our nonreading friends my question to you is this how badass was yorens last stand obviously this is a rhetorical question i am not asking to hear you equivocate on whether it was worthy of a thread or not i am asking to see who among you can do justice to its awesomeness with the written wordbeginif you read the book arya and crew find him dead with quite a few ser amorys men and during the fight at the hold fast wall he  i think took out even more before the wall was breachedthings of note watching arya and yorens last scene together was i thought another little gem for episode 3 which has quite a few was that really tom playing jaqen in the cage almost got the impression they may have shot that scene before wlaschiha was available not sure alas the elaboration of that sequence was really intense in the novel we kind of lost that a neat wrap on the gendry thing  using lommey  here the thing maybe i dont remember from the novel that well amory wasnt looking for gendry  attacked them for being rebels  in fact seems to me the whole gendry  bastard thing gets totally lost in the later chaos and never comes up again and by asos nobody cares anymore edited by boojam 17 april 2012  0954 pm"

"Greatjonsrevenge",2012-05-03,"so is this thread is about  things that dont add up   as in stuff that is drastically changed from the books  or things added to the story that should not be there  why has no one mentioned the fabricated homoerotic relationship between renly and loras tyrell  obviously this was added for the pure  steaminess as we know hbo has to have gay stuff in their shows ridiculous i also noticed in a preview  havent seen the episode yet  that arya speaks with tywin at some point that simply never happened in the books why  this is what kills me  i understand making changes to simplify  or as a result of time constraints etc but there are many big changes occurring which i find pointless matter of fact arya speaking with tywin could change the entire direction of several storylines when played out to a logical conclusion i just dont get it"

"Nymeria101",2012-04-18,"yeah i noticed that toowell i guess they decided to skip the scenes of arya gendry and others escaping because they thought they were unnecessary and a waste of time but since it doesnt affect the story it doesnt really matter maybe arya will start hating the tickler on their way to harrenhall i dont know but i agree with youseason 1 was better edited by nymeria101 18 april 2012  0507 am"

"jugdesh258",2012-04-18,"except for the fact that lommy forgot to say i yield before getting it in the throat i think they did a good job condensing the storyline it is not just for timing alot in the chapters is selfreflection pontificating on the past and pov actually recaping events that other nonpov characters have done to move along the story that dont work on screen"
"lightbringer333",2012-04-18,"one of the main problem with the season 2 is it is based on clash of kings and in which there are so many events that took place in short time and so many kings are emerging from all direction and so many twist and turns u cant blame the production team of this show they will have to compromise with the quality of show if they planned it to make it of 10 episodes i agree that season 1 was much better in depth and quality and characters i will give season 1 as 9510 and was almost perfect and season 2 as 8510 just more than good"
"The Monkey",2012-04-18,"the only necessary element on the trip to harrenhall after yoren was killed was the torture scene and in the previews for next week we see arya being present in such a scene plus the tickler has been cast so we will definitely see him they have probably just moved the torture scene to harrenhall or during the journey there"
"The Unborn",2012-04-18,"wow you guys are lucky i can only rate 3 episodes so far as i havent seen the whole season yet i dont understand why people were a bit upset about that scene if they werent captured yet you would need one more episode where theyre running away 10 episode is short enough we dont need to see them run away for another episode if they can merge some events into harrenhal then its all good"
"Sadie Stark",2012-04-18,"i think that is the main thing i think that they should have extended the series by a few episodes that way they dont have to squash everything into 10 episodes for a book as big as acok i would have thought 12 episodes would be pushing it i understand there may be budgetary limits but taking it as far as they can benefits us the viewers who are sat there going whywhywhy have they done that i think my biggest regret so far is reading the books because im getting wound up at the way theyve handled a few things"

"_Oberyn_",2012-04-18,"ive been upset by alot less but this was a good change imo it was a nicely done shift of story that made sense for a change unlike most other deviations that seem to be random and pointless i think there is a small mishap right at the end a second before arya has her lightbulb moment there is a horse whinny in the background that makes arya look like she is reacring to the sound rather then haveing an idea"
"sarah.jenice",2012-04-18,"i understand why they had to condense it so we can get to harrenhall faster i figured they would eliminate arya and co on the run when she told gendry her true identity in episode 2 yes the scene was a bit short and with them cutting arya on the run i wish they would have at least let them fight a little longer with hot pie yelling hot pie im just trying to love the show as it is and not worry if it isnt an exact recreation of the books i think they are really trying hard to hit the major plot points and that makes me happy"

"Blangadanger",2012-04-19,"personally i thought the entire episode was one of the best in the series so far i especially liked the way they tied yoren into aryas story i loved that he went down in a rage of glory the lannister guard who killed lommy was great too i understand the complaints purists have about the hbo series but ive been loving the changes so far i think it makes more sense to have all of the stuff that happens to arya in book 2 happen mainly in harrenhal since it gives viewers a place to identify with it also gives arya potentially more screen time with some important characters like tywin the tickler and jaqen so that her internal struggles in her mind are made more explicit to viewers maisie williams has been just as tremendous this season im looking forward to more of her scenes"

"Kasoroth",2012-04-20,"while i agree with you that changing it to make the attack about gendry wasnt really that believable in comparison to the way it played out in the book i will argue that theres little reason for them to distinguish between a dark haired boy and a blonde one as robert baratheons bastard remember all three of his supposedly legitimate children are golden haired like their mother cersei under those examples its not unreasonable to assume a bastard could be blonde as well right the cover up and discovery of all baratheons being black of hair is something only ned stark and jon arryn before him had pieced together and ned didnt get to bring that proof to light except the letter he sent to stannis we book readers have a lot of behind the scenes knowledge that these on screen guards would not have hadi was thinking along the same lines the only information we actually see the gold cloaks receive is that1 his name is gendry2 hes headed north on the kings road with the nights watch3 he has a bulls head helmet that he made himselfthis seems like sufficient information even without a physical descriptionjoffrey didnt know whowhere all of his fathers bastards were and i doubt janos slynt did either tracking them down probably would have required getting information from varys or possibly littlefinger though the scene with barra makes this seem less likely the gold cloaks are not exactly a small elite trustworthy fighting force theyre more like a bunch of hired thugs who likely talk more than they should when theyre drunk unless varys was deliberately trying to make all the gold cloaks see the truth of the rumors that had caused joffrey to order the slaughter in the first place he would have probably tried to avoid bringing attention to the fact that they all had black hair he might have even sacrificed a few random other kids without black hair just to keep any of the gold cloaks from noticing that all their targets were dark hairedalso it wasnt really a large patrol sent specifically to hunt gendry it was more like a pair of gold cloaks sent to find him expecting him to be handed over by yoren because they had a royal warrant demanding it when that failed they were too far from kings landing to go back for reinforcements so they requested help from a military patrol that happened to be nearby amory lorch probably had better things to do than hunt down roberts bastards but when two gold cloaks with a royal warrant show up and ask for assistance he cant exactly refuse without risking pissing off joffreyedit i mostly like the way the scene was handled though i would have liked a somewhat larger fire around the wagon and i was a bit sad that arya never really got a chance to use needle except to kill the stable boy in season 1 edited by kasoroth 20 april 2012  0624 pm"

"pretzalz",2012-04-21,"about the 2 extra episodes if you look at hbos seasons for their 1hour dramas over the past decade their episode length varies from 813 if it was standard hbo practice that every season was 10 episodes then it would be silly to bitch that game of thrones was only 10 episodes but it isnt even within the same series you see different season lengths im not totally convinced that got is more expensive than say true blood or boardwalk empire both of which get 12 episode seasons so perhaps the cost question is something of a red herring a show like big love which one might expect was cheaper to produce only got 9 and 10 episodes for the last 2 seasons and oz had 8 episode seasons so i have hopes that a large driver in season length is artistic but i am of course not privy to hbos decision making one of gots strengths is its pacing and spreading it out endangers that even if you did aryas arc the long way thats only an extra 510 minutes not enough to justify an entire new episode on its own so then the question is what other scenes need to be added its also worth remembering in all of this that hbo does get something out of extra episodes they fill up extra weeks of programming so people keep their subscriptions they can charge more for the dvds and they are more likely to hit a total episode number needed for syndication so the extra cost isnt exactly completely nonrecoupable as for the scene itself i was disappointed watching it mainly because it was one of the scenes that i remember the best so i notice the differences more but at the same time i thought how it was done worked lets be honest them traipsing through the woods would have been boring television so the question is it worth it to have arya and friends run away only for for arya to mount a suicidal rescue mission when you arent going to show the intervening bits or is it clearer to have arya just mount the suicidal charge when it is clear that she had the opportunity to escape from this perspective i like how they did it and i dont think it had much to do with them being cheap i think this also necessitated the battle being in a less fortified position it is much harder to suggest the possibility of escape from a fortified position without actually having the escape happen"

"Dirty Steve",2012-04-22,"first of all i never said i was angry i said the name change was annoying and although i certainly understand why they changed the name it is annoying because i would rather have changed oshas name asha actually kicks ass and has her own povs in the book although osha is a significant secondary character in the episodes being portrayed asha is an active participant in moving the action of the ploti know who took over the city watch it doesnt make sense to take out characters whom the original writer grrm had in a secondary hierarchy and replace him bywater with a character bronn who was never the commander of the watch and would have been politically unacceptable as the chief of the watch tyrion would never have been so politically naive as to make a sellsword the commander of the watch at this point he does indeed make him a lord later in the saga but only when it is totally to his own advantagebackgroundas far as rokharo is concerned i feel that an underlying theme of danys part in the plot is the small but powerful and loyal group of followers that are the backbone of her quest for power they could certainly have found another actor to play the part rather than going on the cheap and cutting off his headyou may like roz scenes and that is fine for you but if there is not enough time to do things correctly then why waste time with pointless t and a filler i mean really there is sex o plenty in the exisiting cast of characters why waste precious time on an extraneous distractionbas for arya being older well of course she is a whole year older but that doesnt mean that one of the most effective scenes in the entire saga should be bowlderized for goodness sake she was wise enough that she gave up her identity as arya of house stark in about 10 seconds and although i have never been in a medieval battle i am sure many participants would be shouting the entities they were loyal to and do you think that winterfell was exempt from condemning people to the black watch so the idea that a person disguised as a male would draw additional attention to herselfhimself by crying out winterfell in the middle of a desperate conflict seems ludicrous to me the dramatic tension within arya of concealing her identity which she had been suppressing while all the unfair and despicable things were being done to her legacy which results in her crying winterfell this was a dramatic device which grrm utilized extremely effectively in the originaland you know this is typical of the kind of decisions the producers have made that have made me a bit disappointed in the series edited by dirty steve 22 april 2012  0311 pm"

"Ran",2012-04-17,"yes i thought that was interesting his being much more of a pimp is certainly a change but i think grrms remark probably goes further and probably has to do with the nakedness of littlefingers emotions at times as desired by the writers and the fact that he has been more readily revealed in his aims and pursuits thats a big change for a character whose goals remain to this day not exactly transparent and still up for speculation"

"Buckwheat",2012-04-19,"right and you know what else why would gendry give lommy the helm or let even let it out of his sightsned stark who was your momgendry the helm is not for salehe loved that helm and wouldnt let lommy have it as they try to escape and have a battlei do not think gendry let lommy have the helm i think he forgot it laying there when he run and lommy picked it up probably he thought it was going to help himthere is not way aryas full list will get into the show there are simply too many irrelevant characters like raff on it it would only confuse the wiewers and not really help the story"
"Davos55",2012-04-19,"i do not think gendry let lommy have the helm i think he forgot it laying there when he run and lommy picked it up probably he thought it was going to help himthere is not way aryas full list will get into the show there are simply too many irrelevant characters like raff on it it would only confuse the wiewers and not really help the storyi think gendry forgot it as well but it is still unlike him to do thati wouldnt say raff is necessarily irrelevant he is the one who kills the owner of the inns son in chiswycks story and he killed lommy granting him a spot on aryas hit list in affc jaimes group goes to harrenhal and he finds out info from raff he is noted as being much more well spoken than anyone else there and jaime takes him with him to riverrun he is now taking escorting robin ryger and desmond grell to maidenpool so they can go to the wall i am sure this will atleast be mentioned or come into play in the next novelsmy prediction is that they run into nymeria and she ends up killing raffi know the entire list may confuse people but i think it is great because it started out so large and it keeps dwindling the list helps drive arya and it isnt that hard to follow in my opinion but i am sure they will probably cut out some people from it unfortunately dunsen being a likely candidate for instance i just dont want them to cut raff out or chiswyck or others edited by davos55 19 april 2012  0510 pm"
"Buckwheat",2012-04-19,"ok he might not have been as irrelevant as a random commoner he serves some purpose in the story but when edmure and blackfish and the reed children for all i know are cut there is little possibility for raff dunsen polliver and tickler to be given a large parts of the story one of them may do it or they will merge them into one or two characters arya is already going around killing nobodies in the books it would look ridiculous on screen like her story is not connected with the others anymore"
"Davos55",2012-04-19,"very good point on edmure blackfish and the reeds i have missed them a lot myself and they play huge roles in the book i am just wishful thinking about the future in regards to her prayer list though i dont know what you are referring to with her going around killing nobodies in the books"

"Nebmai",2012-04-19,"i dont think edmure and the others were cut totally from the series i read a recent interview with one of d  d and he said there were some key characters they held off on introducing till next season just to avoid having too many new ones added at once to an already huge list he used the phrase delayed not cut or something close to that"
"Arkash",2012-04-19,"and also one thing to keep in mind is that there are characters in the second book who donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t appear this season but are coming in later itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s just about so many new characters introduced in the second season so we saved some for the next season they arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t being omitted theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re just being delayedanyway i think the first casting annoucments for season 3 will fall within two monthsabout aryas prayer you can hear and see it at the very beginning of the late religion video joffrey cersei ilyn payne she says apparently she skips the titleshttpwwwyoutubecomwatchfeatureplayerembeddedvdie0q3pgcow edited by arkash 19 april 2012  0610 pm"

"HannibalStark",2012-04-22,"and it seems like the gold cloaks were given specific names and places to find each bastard and werent told to scour westeros for black haired bastardsso after not finding gendry at the smiths in the first place maybe the only description they had was male and bull helmeti am sure its not the same people that are killing each one and its not like the fact that roberts bastards all have to have dark hair even comes up or is even discussedit took jon aryn how many years and ned most of the first bookseason and he was intentionally looking into jons death although its funny considering what the actual reason why jon aryn was actually killed but as to lommyafter his constant whining in the books i kinda wasnt that upset he was stabbed in the throat and i think the thread question was already answered"

"Marjie Eilie Myatt",2012-04-22,"i thought i saw lommy grab the bullshaped helm when they were first alerted to being attacked gendry wasnt in the room or was asleep or whatever obviously hbo has combined two different attacks because in the book the young people escape through the tunnel under the burning barn indeed they are holed up in some abandoned holdfast somewhere and amory lorchs men have to scale the wall its the beginning of lommys preoccupation with yielding isnt it its only later that they are captured after attempting to transport lommy for example and attempting to sneak into a village to see whats going on for some reason i assumed it was chiswyck who killed lommy wasnt he the first one that arya charges jaqen to kill at harrenhal and i didnt remember that their pursuers actually were looking for someone named gendry in particular that surprised me everythings blurring together now too much to keep track of just sit back and enjoy the hbo version i did like the yielding repartee in the book but theres just no time in the series"

"James Arryn",2012-04-16,"the best part was the way varys started the scene by gleefully saying how much he loved it when conversations began that way and then fell into a look of disgust  disappointment when he heard tyrion say theon greyjoy i interpreted that as him immediately figuring out what game tyrion was playing and being almost insulted that anyone could think he would fall for it if i recall correctly when they cut to tyrion he had an odd look on his face too as if he realized varys was on to him this is all subject to interpretation but im pretty sure thats how the scene was playedi friggin love varys and tyrion but we see so little of varys that his scenes always stick out to methat was sort of my take as well i think he saw through it im not sure he knew exactly whylike i doubt he went so far as to think hes giving a different version to everyone to see who leaksbut i think he saw through the idea of tyrion wanting to wed with the iron islands of all options and so knew that either he was being tested or played in some wayi think it was also interesting that only pycelle failed to argue i think if i hadnt known from the book i would have known from that distinction lf even arguedi dont think he went so far as to see through it like varys did but i got the sense he sniffed something if only tyrion making a bad decision and wondering how he could play that to his advantage"
"Pliny",2012-04-16,"varys would have never in a million years believed that tyrion would send myrcella off to the iron islands other than that great scene and cinematographyactually my reading of the varys bit was that he didnt believe it for a second and guessed what tyrion was up to he was then able to make sure he appeared to be tyrions friend i hope thats what was intended because if so it just makes it all the more interestingthat was my interpretation as wellas far as the north ripe for the picking business goes it seems that the show is playing on a theme of the first book that trust and honor sometimes lead to pain ned relied on the honor of others and robb trusts theons honor and balon greyjoys honor as well even when catelyn warns him not to its i suppose a contrast to tyrions success for the time being in trusting nobody just a partially formed thought i had smilepng classbbcemoticon alt "
"Lors' Edrick",2012-04-16,"yes the theon bit was not the most appealing ploy to go with i am under the opinion that at least a proposal to loras tyrell would have made more sense but seeing as though he was 3rd on the tyrell list it wouldnt look right to propose a marriage alliance to a princess and a future lord who will probably not even inherit his fathers vast holdings a better proposal could have possible been one for myrcella to wed her second cousin lancel oh that would have just been fun to watch as varys took it all in"

"DannySpud",2012-04-16,"the scene was executed quite well apart from the change in the marriage alliances as i wrote in another thread i dont quite understand why they would change tommen being sent to dorne as a ward into offering myrcella to theon i dont think it makes tyrions plot easier to understand plus it makes him look a bit stupid both the actual marriage alliance myrcellatrystane martell as well as the red herring for littlefinger myrcellarobert arryn were sound choices and both believable whereas the one thrown at varys was so obviously a ruse as to be embarassing theon is for all tyrion knows a staunch stark supporter with no tendency to betray robb not with any leverage over his father the iron islands are too far away for their fleet to make a difference to the double baratheon threat from the sea and the south to kings landing the martells and the arryns both could bring their might to bear against either renly or stannis respectively therefore both alliances would make sense littlefinger surely thinks so at least he seems to buy into the scheme fostering tommen at dorne would also make sense and varys could be made to believe that tyrion favours this option but the myrcellatheon plot seems to far fetched for as skilled a player as varys to buy into it more so making varys believe someone as smart as tyrion would favour that allianceseeing how tyrion regards varys as his most skilled and dangerous opponent at the game of thrones it surprises me that the writers went for that change it makes tyrion appear a bit stupid to think he could fool varys that easilyany thoughts on why they opted for that changei know it seems like only a minor thing but it bothers mei think it makes the scene much easier to follow when i first read that chapter and the resulting arrest of pycelle i was a bit confused and had to reread it before i got what was going on probably my slowest moment when reading the books but still having all three involving myrcella makes it abundantly clear that not all three can happen and that tyrion is playing them its done better in the books with varys showing tyrion that he knows about the conflicting arrangements already but the way it was done would have taken half the episode"
"Bambi",2012-04-16,"fascinating topic visited here for this tonight biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd  the scene worked really well especially in consideration with the limited possibilities of the show vs the book i think its actually the far most brilliant solution until now from the writers"

"Envie",2012-04-16,"a great way to bring a fascinating chapter into a fairly short scene without it actually feeling rushed its a fine example of how much smoother this season is in transitioning between scenes even if this technically was one sceneyes and it also lends some credit to the writers as able to come up with clever ways to twist a very heavy novel into some artistically done acting and character transitions i think many of us myself included have been hard on the producers of the show when they make changes from the book for the sake of paring down the length of scenes and characters many disagree with omissions or additions but i think theyve got an overall great handle on how to best display such an epic saga as 5000 pages of detailed writing has done in such a shorter length of time and less ability to give lots of detail as restricted by film"
"Dr. Pepper",2012-04-16,"the scene was crafted very well it was sort of confusing in the books at first read because it was spread out over many pages i had to go back to reread a couple of times to finally have my aha moment i agree that it wasnt believable for a book reader for tyrion to suggest theon greyjoy as an option to varys i interpreted varys reponse as his disbelief that tyrion was being serious and a subtle acknowledgement that varys understood what game tyrion was playing however my sister doesnt read the books and she seemed to accept it as a suitable offer so worked for non book readers but was strange for book readers its the middle ground i suppose dd struggle with"

"Trinket2",2012-04-21,"it was nicely done ive been a bit worried that tyrions cunning side hasnt been shown enough and im glad they kept this scene in the show the only problem was the myrcellatheon proposal but meh im willing to overlook that this was probably one of my favorite episodes so far just because of this scene"
"Envie",2012-04-21,"at the end of the test i dont think tyrion really cares if lf and varys believed the offer he was making what he cared about was getting rid of the least reliable pawn in the game and that was pycelle i think he even had a suspicioun it was pycelle anyways and that hes not nearly in the same league as the other two as far as craftiness what he offered up to varys impossible as it was may have been on purpose because he wants varys to think hes more foolish politically than he really is with lf theres never been any question that it was the offer of harenhal that clinched it he could have offered the moon as the deal and littlefinger would still consider it if it seemed implausible for a match with theon greyjoy to work then all the more reason to give the lease valid offer to varys because of course varys knows everything via his spy network"
"LordMarani",2012-04-21,"honestly i dont think theres any lore reason why tyrion told varys the greyjoy marriage plan it was simply a show reason they focus on only using very few names of characters not introduced yet or probably not remembered the dinner table scene had the purpose to reestablish who myrcella is for nonreaders and tommen was probably let out of the story to avoid confusion he will probably get more focus once myrcella is sent to dorne and for the three stories they already used one house that wasnt shown yet dorne lysa and the vale are well known from s1 lf even repeated parts of the story so people remember and the greyjoys got a lot of focus in these past episodes so the writers changed tyrions story to varys to use a house that is well known even if it makes little sense plotwise they just try to keep the number of characters and locations down so nonreaders are not overwhelmed"
"Planetary",2012-04-22,"the best part was the way varys started the scene by gleefully saying how much he loved it when conversations began that way and then fell into a look of disgust  disappointment when he heard tyrion say theon greyjoy i interpreted that as him immediately figuring out what game tyrion was playing and being almost insulted that anyone could think he would fall for it if i recall correctly when they cut to tyrion he had an odd look on his face too as if he realized varys was on to him this is all subject to interpretation but im pretty sure thats how the scene was playedi friggin love varys and tyrion but we see so little of varys that his scenes always stick out to memost definitely and after the disgust and disappointment he had an amused look on his face varys definitely knew what was up"

"Envie",2012-04-18,"we know precious little about others also have you ever seen anyn zombie moviebook probably same reason they might also eat them as gilly said for the life or the warmth perhaps they want to literally taste lifeok we may not know the eating habits of the others but we do know the others are not the same thing as a wight right the wights are what happens when the others kill a human and it becomes a semicoherent mindless zombie like thing after death both wights and the others have blue eyes but its very different in appearance one is supposed to have some sort of magical mystical appearance while the wights have a cold dead blue eye look im fairly certain the two are completely differentso what we have to figure out now with that scene  was it a wight that picked up the baby or an other many have complained it didnt look like they imagined an other to lookbulky too shadowy etc and i even thought the thing had some sort of furs or clothing on so at first i was confused i have read nonreaders who thought it was a wildling even if it was a wight i dont think it would be gentle or conscious of its actions that way they seem more zombie like whereas the others are supposedly sentient beingsalso back on the topic of the sons remember the wives urge sam in the later visit to take gilly and her newborn away because now that craster is dead the sons will be coming soon so im thinking these sons are not babies or little boys but grown men now whatever kind of men that may be is debatable wights how did they get that way if they were babies when craster set them out for sacrificeso many mysteries"
"Ponyo Payne",2012-04-18,"yes good and chewy mysteries ive always wondered about the sons coming too somehow i think that there will be something pretty cool involved the big clue about it being an other picking up the baby was that the ice cracking voices were heard just like in episode 1 another thought with the amount of ignorance about the others the kw might not have any firm idea about how people become wights"
"Nebmai",2012-04-18,"to me what jon saw picking up the baby looked like the others from from the beginning of episode one it looked too coordinated to be a wight plus it didnt really look like just a frozen undead person it seemed like it was semi  gingerly picking it up to carry it off my gut tells me for some kind of dark magic purpose maybe some kind of ritual sacrifice where they draw power from its young life force maybe somehow they can raise it to be a servant or transform it to an other i doubt well ever find our for sure"

"Tadco26",2012-04-19,"also back on the topic of the sons remember the wives urge sam in the later visit to take gilly and her newborn away because now that craster is dead the sons will be coming soon so im thinking these sons are not babies or little boys but grown men now whatever kind of men that may be is debatable wights how did they get that way if they were babies when craster set them out for sacrificeso many mysteriesyes and we dont know if the comment literally means crasters sons or if that is just the name they gave the creatures whether they were wights or others perhaps the wives have no idea what happens to the babes after craster takes them other than they never return gilly also referred to the babes as sacrifices to the cold gods but does anyone really believe they are godsregardless of whether the tv version was an other which is what it looked like to me at first glance or a wight that has minimal insight into what crasters sons were in the books the scene was completely made up there have been several things in the show that completely contradict known facts in the books so i dont look at the show really giving us more real insight there i have considered the possibility that perhaps the babies are used to make new others though which to me would make the most sense if they were literally supposed to be crasters sons either that or we will see a small army of undead babies attack the wall some time in the future as i find it hard to imagine wights growing up from babies to adults edited by tadco26 19 april 2012  1120 am"
"Leuf",2012-04-19,"in the show jon is not quite sure what he saw so he and mormont can have a discussion just about craster sacrificing his sons and be very ambiguous about the rest in the book its quite clear to jon from what gilly tells him that there is definitely a connection between what craster is doing and the supernatural even if he doesnt 100 understand its the others even if jon is that stupid mormont should be able to put it together or sam yet he doesnt convey that information to mormont at all talking to him only about the sacrifice of the sons and sheep this is a pretty important piece of information that jon manages to forget to pass on so the show dodges that aspect of the books in either case mormont is far more concerned about what mance is up to than the wight attack a couple wights are no big deal once you know how to kill them mance rayder with an army of wildlings is a big problem but if mormont is told the others are running around in the forest around him wouldnt he high tail it back to the wall right then in the books jon basically gets everyone killed because he doesnt pass that information on to his commander then he gets promoted to commander if mormont and all the rangers know that craster is sacrificing the sons to the others then things make no sense at all the nights watchs whole problem in the early parts of the book is that they dont know what they are facing and then that they cant get anyone in authority to believe them when they do but if mormont already knows then benjen knows benjen can tell ned who will believe him ned will tell robert who will believe him and get a gleam in his eye at a chance to fight the mother of all battles so mormont absolutely cannot know until after benjen is missing at the earliest i prefer to think grrm was just high when he wrote that chapter and forget about it"

"Lyeder",2012-04-19,"i think that the night watch knew that craster was not raising his sons and put them somehow to death let them starve eg they were not investigating further but now that they know that the others are out again remember also that white walkers have not been seen for centuries before book 1 the old bear and jon puts things together and thinks craster is sacrifying his sons to the ohters without knowing exactly how and what becomes of them"

"Leuf",2012-04-19,"whether jon thinks its others or wights in the book he still doesnt mention it to mormont its a vital piece of information that gets lost jon knows something supernatural is actually taking the babies and nobody else in the nw does the show is better since jon isnt really sure what he saw"
"Black Crow",2012-04-21,"well we were shown that mormont knew craster was abandoning his newborn sons in the forest but mormont has never actually seen an other and doesnt know they exist  neither does jon or any other living member of the nights watch at this point the nights watch along with the rest of the realm believes the others to be mythicalah but as he hinted in the episode mormont does know about white walkers as revealed in agot tyrion3i tell you my lord the darkness is coming there are wild things in the woods direwolves and mammoths and snow bears the size of aurochs i have seen darker shapes in my dreamsin your dreams tyrion echoed thinking how badly he needed another strong drinkmormont was deaf to the edge in his voice the fisherfolk near eastwatch have glimpsed white walkers on the shorethis time tyrion could not hold his tongue the fisherfolk of lannisport often glimpse merlingsdenys mallister writes that the mountain people are moving south slipping past the shadow tower in numbers greater than before they are running my lord but running from what lord mormont moved to the window and stared out into the night these are old bones lannister but they have never felt a chill like this tell the king what i say i pray you winter is coming and when the long night falls only the nights watch will stand between the realm and the darkness that sweeps from the north"

"Planetary",2012-04-22,"mormont knows its an other jon tells him that he saw a thing taking the baby and mormont says whatever it was im sure youâll see it again so definitely mormont knows its not a god offering its an offering to the others that doesnt mean he knows its a white walker or a wight north of the wall has all sorts of weird creatures thats a logical fallacy like saying if it isnt a fox then it must be a chupacabraanyway the main purpose of the nights watch is to protect the realm from white walkers with that in mind plus the fact that they just got attacked by two wights its unlikely mormont would be so casual about it those things are the reason they went on the mass ranging in the first place"

"Chelly",2012-04-22,"this did not bother me because it was handled more effectively on the show imo aeron just pours some water on him and theon was more annoyed by the cold water dripping down his back it was much better on the show and held more meaning for theon and his decision to follow his family and people it had a much more dramatic impact than in the book honestly i couldnt think of better cooler way to introduce the damphair than for his very first scene to be him drowning and reviving his followers id like that image to be saved for damphairs entrance on the show it immediately gives the viewer a vibe of the kind of man aeron is it wouldnt be as cool or shocking if they already gave this image away"

"birdsong66",2012-04-16,"ill take it a step furtheri dont imagine catelyn would have taunted mycella with the death of her brothers for sport eitherher nutty over mycellas future was more about tyrion arranging it than poor matches for royal offspring which btw they are decidedly not that and the fact that men keep making decisions she feels entitled to make by birth and position im going to love watching this malignancy fallas for catelyn brokering a match for arya im afraid i cant imagine any situation in which selecting a spouse for arya be it for the benefit of war effort or strengthening great house alliances would be a simple thing so someone better debastardize gendry real quick as it is the closest to a suitable match by temperament at the moment"

"Qhorin Halfhand and Yoren",2012-04-16,"yeah in that scene i actually sympathized somewhat with cersei which is not easy to achieve she is still a terrible person but i understand the sentiment of not wanting her kids to be pawns of game of thrones with their well being coming second and being forced to marry who others want but to some extend it was also her being pissed at tyrion being behind it of course myrcella being away of kl in some way does protect her well being if kl would fall i think she has a fair point about the unfairness of children and people especially women being mistreated in that way being forced to marry people and the fact that she is talking from experience also makes the scene stronger but too bad that cersei doesnt share the same sentiments about people who are not her children or herself and are someone elses children and are abused in the game of thrones still her being against that kind of abuse although being against it only in a very few select cases well it might be one of her very few positives catelyn is more intelligent than cersei and more practical less delusional person making a deal with walder frey was absolutely vital for her sons war for the riverlands even so she did it she also has been luckier than cersei in regards to arranged marriages catelyn also lacks her daughters victories in the war might make it more likely to get them back through diplomacy which is what she is in favor after their victories and capture of jaime lannister i think catelyn is more concerned about survivalvictoryregaining daughters first and to a less extend about who they would marry i dont think that her priorities were wrong when she was negotiating also as someone else said if say myrcella was her prisoner i dont see her treating her as badly as cersei treated sansa edited by qhorin halfhand and yoren 16 april 2012  0540 pm"
"Dr. Pepper",2012-04-16,"just a sidebar question what did that scene with sansa and shae mean i got that it showed where shae ended up and that shae lies about her background but i got the feeling there was some other meaning we were supposed to interpret from their interaction"

"teemo",2012-04-17,"i just figured sansa was frustrated because not only was shae incompetent but sansa also believes all of her chambermaids are cerseis spies however i never remember sansa using that kind of tone with anyone in the books especially while she was in kl and even when she thought the maids were spies shes so timid and depressed in kl she hardly has the energy to barely talk to someone let alone go off on them"

"Woman of War",2012-04-19,"i think here we have a problem resulting from the fact that hbo sansa is so much older than book sansa if she were the same timid and formally courteous child she is in the books it would hardly be believable since we see a very tall strong and healthy looking young woman who can certainly not be presented as a naive child she would come over as outright stupid there they certainly made some mistakes in series one the hbo sansa is a girl that would be able to speak up to people and since they cannot show her as more actively speaking up to cersei or joffrey without changing the storyline of her character they are forced to make her more age adequate in her exchange with shae and of course and this is a shame there will be no menarche scene sansa is too old actually this was the part of her story where she had come most alive to me there she was really authentic a living breathing girl who reacted in a completely understandable manner so we have here a character that will either like in series one act too young naive or you might call it inexperienced for her age or there will be some changes one is that she can get truly bratty forgetting her courtesies towards the supposed weaker sophie turner looks physically strong not princesslike fragile at all so sansa should be able to develop some skills of self defense or riding for her life letting her continue as damsel in distress would make her seem unnecessarily dumb and helpless not going along with age and looks but nonetheless the shae character struck me as the stronger personality of the two given the inferior position hbo shae has no idea of the danger she is in at kl giving happily away her secrets to varys maybe this is the moment when she gets hired as spy but she is streetwise and full of life not the nicest person but interesting sorry very much off topic back to topic it always struck me as so very cold and cruel how both cat and robb reacted when they heard about sansas marriage to tyrion of course they must have believed that tyrion had claimed his marital rights and there was no pity for sansa as a person no feeling for her pain and misery only scorn about the betrayal to house stark and fury about the stolen claim but where was the beloved daughter the little sister in it sansa was no longer one of them to robb and cat she had become a lost cause a problem here i understood cats feelings much less than her emotions towards jon and this makes me believe that if sansa had been returned to them they would have married her off to the next guy whom they needed as ally like they had planned with arya but in sansas case straightaway sansa would have had to do her duty without protest so little advantage compared to the tyrion marriage only in that case served by her own beloved family edited by woman of war 19 april 2012  1149 am"
"Rapsie",2012-04-21,"it always struck me as so very cold and cruel how both cat and robb reacted when they heard about sansas marriage to tyrion of course they must have believed that tyrion had claimed his marital rights and there was no pity for sansa as a person no feeling for her pain and misery only scorn about the betrayal to house stark and fury about the stolen claim but where was the beloved daughter the little sister in it sansa was no longer one of them to robb and cat she had become a lost cause a problem here i understood cats feelings much less than her emotions towards joni think they were quite worried for sansa as a person as well as shocked about the betrayal arranged marriages are normal in westeros forced marriages when the child involved is a prisoner are not the norm they do show quite a bit of concern for sansarobbs fingers brushed the pommel of his sword if i could id take his ugly head off sansa would be a widow then and free there is no other way i can see they made her speak the vows before a septon and don a crimson cloaki should have let lysa push him out her moor door my poor sweet sansa  why would anyone do this to herbring my girls back to me brienne bring them back safe and theyll kill sansa too once the dwarf gets a child from hermy daughter has been given to a faithless dwarf to bear his vile children was there ever a wedding less joyful she wondered until she remembered her poor sansa and her marriage to the imp mother take mercy on her she has a gentle soul"
"Makea",2012-04-21,"catelyn is a more loving and protecting mother and as someone said before i too believe that she would treat myrcella differently with more kindness anyway than cersei threats sansa as for the marriages well catelyn did have the best interest of her son and the war in mind and i believe she also negotiated in such a way that aryas future husband is fitting as she knows her daughter but yes gendry is a better match for arya and i hope someone will get him put og the position of the kings bastard so they can be together cercei is a completly diffenrent story i do believe she was fustrated because she wanted to be the one to decide who myrcella will marry not having a mothjer to teach her what to do and how to do it is probably why she is so overprotective about her kids and she is maybe trying to compensate and this is why i believe she will make a good decision about the marriage of her children this also seeing how her arranged marriage to robert was not a good one do not get me wrong i do not like her but it was not her fault the marriage was a mess again not having a mother did have a bad influence on her and also the fact that robert was a drunk and never showed her any affectin as he will always love lyanna"
"Lykos",2012-04-21,"ice turtle i think itâs unfair to compare these two incidents we donât really know how much of cerseiâs outrage was due to her concern for myrcella or if she was just pissed because tyrion arranged this betrothal without consulting her catelyn on the other hand had little choice if she wanted robb to succeed catelyn certainly was a hard mother very stern but when it came down to a matter of her daughters chance for survival she even freed jaime knowing and accepting it could mean her own death at the hands of robb i think cersai really loved at least joffrey and myrcella but i donât know how she would have acted if they stood in her way to power and i think she despises tommenâs weakness eta forget all i said didnât notice that this was the got tv series subforum edited by lykos 21 april 2012  0435 pm"

"Hyper",2012-04-20,"yeah its really hard to argue against the 7 being a very closely based upon the medieval catholic church they just have so much in common in their hierarchy and structure others have made the point that the rhllor worship can be compared to more extremist fundamentalist christian or islamic branches an interesting point is that the drowned god worship also has christian elements in it  the baptismblessing element"
