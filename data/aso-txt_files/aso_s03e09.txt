"Shehzad Ghias Shaikh",2013-06-02,"i cried too but the tv show really did not do justice to the intensity of the red wedding in the books the lack of drums and a cacophony of sounds was the biggest issue for mealso no greywind acting weirdno catelyn insisting on being fed bread as soon as they come nothingexpected so much more"

"thegreatwhitebear",2013-06-02,"wow just wow i actually felt bad for talisa and robb omg i was praying arya got greywind free so he couldve atleast gotten some freys and that part left me feeling even worse gotta love roose popping in like the dude in the chappelle show skit making fun of the real world and giving robb a drive by stabbing i loved it and hated it at the same time just like my exwife lol"
"Jon Black",2013-06-02,"absolutely great my only problems 1 robb holding his wife after being pierced with arrows not a tear in his eye 2 the tower scene with bran and company w jon down below suffered from either bad editing andor screenwriting this includes the hes one of them part although this was most certainly not an entire wash some of it was okay 3 aryas part outside the rw wasmeh"

"Warhawk137",2013-06-02,"the most enthusiastic 10 ive ever given"
"Ran",2013-06-02,"this is an 8 for me after a long of consideration they failed at capturing the atmosphere which is the thing that really sets this scene apart that catelyn chapter is full of dread from start to finish but they actively went against it and took what to me seemed like the easy way out hide what youre going to do until the last minute to heighten the shock value shock is easy as any number of shlock horror films will reveal controlling the atmosphere unsettling people in subtle ways thats hard"

"Garlan Marius",2013-06-02,"i cried more than any of the times i read that chapterand to think i was going to bitch about ygritte not shooting jon or sam knowing about the black door"
"Ser Robert Strong",2013-06-02,"i gave it a 9 but perhaps im too much of a perfectionist i was worried about talisas presence at the wedding and honestly one of the things that bothered me was robbs reaction to her murder he looked neither sad nor angry but rather bewildered i wish that his facial expression would have shown the emotions that he would probably have been feeling in that moment i thought michelle fairley did a great job of capturing cats emotions but its just hard to do justice to the emotionally crippling internal monologue that you get to read in the books i also figured she wouldnt be able to scratch at her face as it would be a make up nightmare for the tv folks but missed it all the same all in all though i thought that the scene was adapted really well hence a 9 my friends who have not read the books were very worried as soon as the bedding was over and the guards closed the doors and from then on out seemed nearly as displeased as i was when i read the scene as a side note i wish they could have given the extra suspense of not knowing that arya survived the hounds axe like there was in the book but im afraid in that case too many folks would have quit watching the show great job dd heres to hoping they continue to do a great job adapting"

"Winter In My Heart",2013-06-02,"i loved the episode was a little disappointed by the deaths though talisa looked fake as dead to me but she was fine the rest of the episode poor robb felt so bad as he held her though even if i didnt like her acting as she was dead cat why couldnt she have killed a frey who cares about walders wife and grey wind should above killed at least one person before dying still loved the episode though i cant remember being so depressed about seeing somethingand crying because of a showmovie before"

"Jabronius Maximus",2013-06-02,"gave it a 10 talisa and robbs deaths were pretty gut wrenching that was a great episode and sadly they nailed the rw rickons got some acting chops too bad thats the last well see of him until like season 8 that was a touching brotherly scene arya was a bit flat but was pretty good daenerys victory paled in comparison to the rest of the episode and yet even her scenes were pretty good jon didnt stand out and thats a good thing whenever he did stand out i felt it was in a bad way he was good enough and theres a good setup for the subsequent events at castle black and thank got tormund thunderfist aka giantsbane aka husband to bears is still alive i thought hed be doomed in that wildling mission but he lives to har another day har oh and walders actor is that janitor dude from harry potter right argo or argus whateveri was actually starting to like him he had that cool senile humor then of course he unleashed on the starks damn that man i actually burst out laughing when he gave that look to robb when he saw roslin its like hey shes pretty hot eh edited by barristan the boss 02 june 2013  1000 pm"

"nob boffin",2013-06-02,"my forst post on this forum or for that matter on this board but i have to say i gave it a 10 it was awful knowing what was coming and watching it unfold my wife has not read the books and even though i softened it a bit for her she was utterly speechless after it ended i alos liked the bits with sam and especially the part about calming holdor for some reason that really resonated with me"

"Arya Stalka",2013-06-02,"10 wow well done imo i laughed like crazy when arya knocked that man out after begging the hound not to kill him lmao love arya i love this episode because its the point at which i started liking the hound poor arya so backtracking the warging and the ygritte getting all salty scene was pretty cool really people that expect the carbon copy of the book cmon this was awesome i knew what was coming and i felt the same emotions all lover again really looking forward to the last episode and already depressed about waiting another long while before the next season sadpng classbbcemoticon alt  silly things i wished came off the book darrio and his flamboyant ways purple hair and dyed double pronged goatee does he have a harpy hilted knife havent noticed haha jorah was all hatin on him"
"ladyinblack",2013-06-02,"it was better than i expected it to be walder frey is very well cast and michelle fairley was brilliant a pretty good job at condensing storylines at the rw the wilding and bran scenes are not well developed they have done a terrible job with the reeds storyline and osha loved them all in the books"
"Tysha Tully",2013-06-02,"the reading of the scene was repulsive shocking but not surprising in the book i remember a thread of hope when they ate under his roof but the hope turning to despair when the massacre began i rebelled soon after reading it and put the book down for a month i felt grrm was a callous monster and i was so done with it all watching tonight was depressinga sad reminder that ned can never truly be avenged and the house stark i fell in love with was already gone it sucks even more that lord frey was likeable in this episode and rooses evilness is only outdone by his handsomeness oh the humanity"
"clearcolor",2013-06-02,"way better than i was expecting i give it a 9 just for sheer emotional impact i wish they would have had one of robbs men throwing a table over him for protection that scene really stayed with me after reading it i also think the timing of the musicians playing rains of castamere seemed a little off i can deal with cat not clawing her face and while i was never a fan of talysa wow i have to say having her there and getting stabbed in the gut a la dacey mormont was definitely heartbreaking edited by clearcolor 02 june 2013  1015 pm"
"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-06-02,"10 thought it was brilliant for me ms fairley did a fantastic job conveying that vague sense of mounting uneaseforeboding throughout the wedding just with her facial expressions nailed it for me also thought having the first strike be to talisas womb was a great way to shock readers because we really didnt know what was going to happen to her it was such a brutal act that i kind of gasped sure there were things that werent exactly the same as the books but thats what happens when youve got internal monologues i was really surprised it had the impact it did despite knowing what was coming"
"RalnsofCastamere",2013-06-02,"10 out of 10 perfect gray worm red wedding yunkai bran everything was perfect well done d  d and the whole cast and crew of this brilliant show"

"Talbot",2013-06-02,"might get crapped on here by some but i really think if you were disappointed in that scene it was because you put way too much weight in the books reading and cant grasp adaptation to the screen"
"Dreadstark Bastard",2013-06-02,"i gave it a 9 but thats from rounding up from an 85 the actors nailed it though bitter that michelle fairley had to wait this long for the writers to let her character shine my major criticism though is similar to some others  wish they had done more this season to plant the seeds of what was to come captured in the book by tywins line and i dont know it by heart and so must paraphrase that the war would be won by ravens and not by swords and capture the dread cats scenes with bolton got to it a bit also wish we had gotten to know robbs bannermen better besides karstark and bolton important though the latter is"

"QueenBeyondtheWeb",2013-06-02,"rosalind was all wrong she wasnt sad or nervous at all really focusing on rob and talisa vs rob and cat changed the scene and somehow though gripping and shocking was not as emotionally horrific as cats pov in the book i loved the episode but it just doesnt come close to the emotional punch the scene packed in the book"

"Talbot",2013-06-02,"theres no such thing as putting too much weight on the bookwell maybe weight is the wrong word but you have to realize how much different it is in telling a story getting details down and building stuff up the show absolutely cannot show the dread we get in that chapter because its coming from catelyns perspective in her head from her inner monologue in the show we have a omniscient view of every character how can they recapture or portray the same kind of dread that we get from cats perspectivewhat was missing from this that made it worse than the books this isnt a knock on opinions and it mightve seemed that way before so i apologize but i just dont get that perspective sometimes"

"Ran",2013-06-02,"the show absolutely cannot show the dread we get in that chapter because its coming from catelyns perspective in her head from her inner monologue in the show we have a omniscient view of every character how can they recapture or portray the same kind of dread that we get from cats perspectivemake it an unpleasant uncomfortable wedding make a point of the horrible food the horrible music that its all too loud and discordant and headacheinducing something you suffer through its a horrible wedding  people who have been to weddings have probably come across an awkard trying one in their time so they can sympathize you want it to end you want them to get on with it not go oh well heres a happy wedding its all worked out in the endpsychological horror films are capable of inducing dread and unease without resorting to narration and inner dialogue the secret of catelyns last chapter is that its basically a work of horror fiction not fantasy in terms of the mode in which it is written george does everything but throw in the boogie manreally tv can do this stuff whether the writers want to do it or not thats up to them but it is possible edited by ran 02 june 2013  1045 pm"

"Florina Laufeyson",2013-06-02,"i agree with this absolutely the book is the inspiration for the series but ultimately to translate the book to screen an adaptation must occur things must be trimmed down the show must create its own canon etc a show is limited by budget time ability etc plus they end up putting a lot of the important things in the scene anyway you just have to actually watch and look like the books everything in the show isnt spoonfedoh man this one had so many more easter eggs than normal i have this super long list of it all my eyes could barely process they were moving to fast across the screen and trying to keep up with what my ears were hearingyes adaptation and putting things to a film medium is difficult and sacrifices must be made but i felt that everything that needed to be conveyed was conveyed cats catatonic face had a lot of impact while i wished she had clawed her face slowly with the same expression alas i cant have everything i was very pleased how it came about the color and lighting of the scene was so exactly how i imagined it oh man"

"Pinkie Baelish",2013-06-02,"i was thinking of giving it a 9 but caved in and gave it a 10 i pictured the rw to be more climactic rather than climactic so i expected a huge massacre in the camps plus i pictured robbs death to be far more out of nowhere than anything else complete with the music speeding up to a crescendo and stopping right as roose twists the blade i also pictured cats breakdown to more insane with the only sound being her laughter i envisioned a silence like the one in neds beheading just before the axe fell and grey wind to put up a fight but i digress great episode all around my heart was pounding and i was on edge for the entire last 10 minutes i like how this week and last week have been much better focused and focusing on a few storylines rather than cramming in about 8 but i do wish stannis arc was better developed this season my main gripe no reveal of ramsay seriously the unsullied are going to feel theons arc has been a complete waste of time if they had showed his reveal right before the massacre started it would have all seemed worthwhile i cant help but feel d and d fucked up big time by not having theon and ramsays last appearance in this episode edited by pinkie baelish 02 june 2013  1055 pm"

"Justin Danford",2013-06-02,"voted 8 objectively speaking i feel they did not capture the atmosphere that the books provided leading up to the massacre this cheapened the shock for me despite already knowing since everything turned so quick i would have liked more suspense possibly stemming from catelyn concerning whether or not walder was going to play nice i think this is made worse considering that at times they seem to want to try and build this ambiguity which began building suspense but then smooth it over i understand they did this to settle the unsullied tv watcher so they think all is well just before the big shock but i felt this lessened the source material the episode basically became the shock and yeah there is huge shock value in the book but its about so much more than just shock obviously i did not hate it so it gets an 8 i also rather liked all the changes and editions they did to advance the plot it just seemed to me that something was missing from the rw but i understand everyone probably has their own unreachable standard of how the rw plays out edit i also enjoyed the eerie death silence and gaping maw of catelyn upon realizing robb was killed it showed in those few seconds that robb was the last thread holding her from being destroyed by grief he dies and she loses all connection it makes her look rather deada living dead which is perfect for what is to come i very much hope they advance that plot for the finale of mysha edited by justin danford 02 june 2013  1158 pm"

"mystikherb",2013-06-03,"i needed a bit to fully evaluate my opinion on this episode im sure anyone on this post is totally okay with seeing everything it didnt say spoilers in the title and im going to go very in depth so im putting the spoiler tag anyway it cant hurt to be careful spoiler im going to give my opinion on this episode piece by piece jonokay so this big scene with jon turned out more or less how i thought it would to be honest it was neither really a hit or miss for me the acting was great and it essentially went the way it needed to move his plot along to be honest i was a bit more focused on brans part in all of this anyway that basically sums up my opinion on thisbranawesome totally awesome i was so honestly surprised that they showed bran warg into hodor surprised in the best kind of way i had feared that they would over look that but no it was done very well and ive been waiting ages to see bran warg while conscious on screen it was everything i wanted it to be and it served that part of the story well plus there was an awesome scene where they made the decision to separate osha and rickon from the game that was very well acted kudos to the kid playing rickon and i think they chose the right time to have this moment very emotional and effectivesamokay as fine a job as the actors are doing at playing sam and gilly i was very much hoping to see coldhands and with sam knowing about nightfort and such im thinking they might skip him now and have sam appear to bran on his own im actually starting to get pretty scared that they may overlook coldhands altogether thats probably my biggest disappointment with the episode to be honest however i could show them going two different routes with this1 sam pops up on bran and has already met coldhands off screen and reveals to bran that someone needs to see him they then reveal coldhands in one of the last possibly the last scene of the finale2 they delay coldhands until late next season to stretch out brans story a bit since he has very little source material leftthats all for thatdaenerysi did love her scenes and i have to admit im kinda digging tv daario although the bit with him walking up after they took yunkai was a bit cheesy the fight scenes in this part were awesome and i loved seeing jorah grey worm and daario fight together they all proved to be pretty badass the only thing is that i was kind of hoping to see more of the battle instead of just hearing they won and i was expecting the battle to go on into the finale that leaves a good bit of room open for the last episode although they need it with so many characters to catch up witharyagetting closer to the moneymaker of this episode so let me say that i did enjoy aryas part in this ill be 100 honest with myself i was expecting them to make her part more of a tearjerker but it definitely served its part i loved how she saw grey wind go down that definitely had its emotion im also kind of relieved they didnt do the arya death fake out i think it just would have detracted from the rw and would not have been convincing on screen at all cant wait to see how maisie takes this role from here on outrobbcatelynokay otherwise i have only positive things to say so ill get the one negative out of the way first i was definitely hoping to see cats hysteria at the end there i wish they had done it but i was so caught up in the scene i didnt even notice at first im going to go on now about what i loved i loooooooved the ominous door closing with the rains starting that was just as effective and more than i was hoping it would be still get goosebumps from that i also like how they handled talisa stabbing her stomach was the most gruesome and tragic way to start this shit that look on rooses face when cat sees the chain mail so damn disturbing and ominous he nailed it in this scene the way robb crawled to talisas body the way the music stopped robbs last moan mother that was all perfect i could go on and on about all of it but there was definitely one thing that stood out to me the most effective element that made it all so damn powerful that would be michelle fairleys portrayal as cat in her final moments i could feel her pain and desperation as she was calling to robb to save himself that second please tore a whole in me and when robb died that cry she gave if her acting before that punched a whole in me her last cry of pain torment and anguish simply killed me inside her scream was resonating inside me well after she stopped and her throat was slit so all in all while few things were not what i expected i was very satisfied with the episode and feel that it did do justice to the book as far as the rw goes of course the book was more effective of course the book was more tragic you were in cats head for all of that still brutally awesome episodeill give it a ten i could be nitpicky and go for 95 but at that point along with comparing it to everything else on tv i might as well just admit it was basically a 10 for me cant wait for the finale edited by mystikherb 03 june 2013  0205 am"

"Gregor's Nancy Boy",2013-06-03,"book spoilersthese are my complaints there are a lot of them let me begin by saying this is my least favorite episode of the entire series and i am utterly disappointed benioff and weiss were the whole reason i started reading a song of ice and fire to begin with game of thrones inspired me to pick up a novel and finish it for the very first time in my nineteen years of life that novel in turn inspired me to read four more after that i trusted them completely with this the red wedding was their ultimate goal in the series and theyve said it from the start i am still in disbelief that they would butcher it so badly but i digress onto business1 robbs arrival at the twins was an event in and of itself his arrival and his death should have been spread out between two episodes as it was in the books with two successive catelyn chapters the entire event happened way too fast for those who have not read the books greywind robb<U+0080><U+0099>s direwolf who has been largely missing from the show until randomly appearing in a kennel this episode attacks some freys in the rain as they greet the starks to their castle robb going through great pains to appease walder frey decides to chain his trusty direwolf outside not in a damned dog kennel throughout their time at the twins greywind howls in despair sensing what is to come2 blackfish  jeyne talisa are supposed to be safe at riverrun not at the twins with robb  catelyn jeyne is still alive in the books supposedly with robb<U+0080><U+0099>s unborn child an entire plot element currently hinges on whether or not that child is a boy she should not have been killed off i<U+0080><U+0099>m surprised they didn<U+0080><U+0099>t kill the blackfish as well how do they explain what he was even doing while his niece and great nephew king were being slaughtered i suppose he has magically escaped the castle and all the carnage outside to return to riverrun where he will most certainly be needed in the future for jaime<U+0080><U+0099>s scenes3 greywind dies after robb this is extremely important sentimentallywise as robb<U+0080><U+0099>s real last words are <U+0080><U+009C>greywind<U+0080><U+0080><U+009D> not <U+0080><U+009C>mother<U+0080><U+0080><U+009D> it is to be assumed robb wargs into his direwolf after he dies since this is the same moment greywind viciously attacks nearby freys who have not yet began their assault robb is betrayed killed by his own man wargs into his wolf then dies all over again it is part of his death and cutting that out of the show makes it considerably less tragic to match the death they gave greywind here was so lacking in dramatic force or quality you barely even cared that he was killed4 another thing that makes robb<U+0080><U+0099>s death less bleak is his childish disgruntlement towards walder frey throughout the episode at this point in the books robb is genuinely sorry for what he did to his house and wants to make amends he sustains every slight walder throws at him without a flinch and handles himself extremely well at the twins in the face of every petulant frey it<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to feel sorry for him here with those petty school boy heroics5 most of the deaths in this episode were incredibly underwhelming compared to the deaths in a storm of swords this was for many reasons unfortunately first of all overly dramatic music was being played over everything when we should have been treated to nothing but the rains of castamere slowly digressing into the boom doom boom of the musicians<U+0080><U+0099> drums secondly robb<U+0080><U+0099>s actor did an absolutely horrible job at displaying any sort of confusion shock fear or despair i heard he cried after he discovered how his character was to be killed but you never would have guessed he actually cared from his performancecatelyn<U+0080><U+0099>s actor was more than capable of carrying out some of the horrific things grr martin described in his books but for whatever reason benioff and weiss decided to stray for something far drabber going catatonic may sound like a proper reaction to the soul crushing sight of what you think is your only surviving child being killed in front of you but when cat<U+0080><U+0099>s scream fades out and she just stands there motionless it doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t deliver the jarring reaction her death deserves it looks more as if she just accepts it and stops struggling in the books she scratches her face to ribbons as she screams bloody murder and the freys waste no time in apprehending her by the hair as her braid is yanked back she thinks <U+0080><U+009C>no not my hair ned loves my hair<U+0080><U+009D> this would have been absolutely perfect had those been her last words she literally goes mad with grief but viewers simply can<U+0080><U+0099>t grasp the extent of that grief without lines such as thisjeyne<U+0080><U+0099>s talisa<U+0080><U+0099>s death besides being totally uncanon took away from the relationship between mother and son it wasn<U+0080><U+0099>t supposed to be about jeyne or robb<U+0080><U+0099>s child it was supposed to be about catelyn and her child this is the relationship we had come to understand indepth from cat<U+0080><U+0099>s perspective since the first book jeyne<U+0080><U+0099>s family were also supposed to be suspected conspirators in the red wedding their daughter was not planned to be killed along with the starks despite jeyne<U+0080><U+0099>s alleged devotion to robb as i mentioned before a huge plot element hinges on her and her baby by the fifth book blackfish holds riverrun against the lannisters with jeyne tight under guard he defends her with his life why would he do this if not to protect an heir now what are they going to come up with when grr martin reveals jeyne is pregnant with the king in the north<U+0080><U+0099>s sonforget the main characters for a second part of the horror of the red wedding was that so many people you were starting to like were all being slaughtered like farm animals it is too much to expect to see minor characters such as dacey mormont and smalljon umber but surely their roles could have been replaced with existing characters in the show characters who in the books did not matter much lopping off the greatjon<U+0080><U+0099>s head in place of his son<U+0080><U+0099>s would have been an excellent deviation as the greatjon is supposed to be held captive then hardly ever mentioned again instead we watch a bunch of bearded men who we<U+0080><U+0099>ve never even seen before being killed in humdrum fashions no crossbow bolts through the mouth no beheadings none of thati doubt it would have had an impact anyway since the gore in this episode was completely unrealistic and tainted by hollywood action movies people do not instantly lose consciousness when their throat is cut then fall to the floor dead when your esophagus is severed you lose the ability to breathe through your mouthnose and begin breathing out of a hole in your neck this is largely impossible though since the wound bleeds profusely clogging your esophagus with fluids you essentially drown on your own blood in a panic making all sorts of horrible snorting noises for up to three minutes i<U+0080><U+0099>m not even sure grr martin was aware of this before writing the red wedding but slitting throats was never described as one fell graze upon the neck catelyn sawed through this person<U+0080><U+0099>s throat until they died stabbing a person in their heart is another matter but looks like bolton missed the mark roose had a tiny dagger in place of a longsword and apparently decided to stab robb in the lower part of his lung causing instant death<U+0080> while all this is happening inside the castle the stark host outside is supposed to be burning to death by the masses as a result of giant feast tents rigged to catch fire and collapse on top of them rather than depict the elaborate trap grr martin conceived it is simply implied all the stark men outside are put to the sword good thing the viewers have no idea how many stark men there are in comparison to bolton men or else they would surely question the effectiveness of an open armed conflict 6 roose<U+0080><U+0099>s performance here was a huge disappointment i was setting my expectations high assuming this actor would be the one to do everything right i was thoroughly enjoying his portrayal of the leech lord up until this point he seemed so smug whereas in the books he barely made an attempt to talk to anyone he played his part perfectly while most of the freys were a nervous wreck but he was never cheeky about it here he looks like he<U+0080><U+0099>s taking great pleasure in taunting the starks as if he hates them roose is a man who plays for the winning team and takes no particular joy in betrayal he just accepts that it<U+0080><U+0099>s practical and carries out his atrocities without guilt in addition to screwing up his behavior the actor got his body movements all wrong as well roose is supposed to glide in and out of the hall as confident and smooth as can be here he darts around ducking his head and lunging out of harm<U+0080><U+0099>s way it<U+0080><U+0099>s just so unlike the lord of the dreadfort but most importantly he says to robb just before he stabs him <U+0080><U+009C>the lannisters send their regards<U+0080><U+009D> i<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry but why did you change that from <U+0080><U+009C>the kingslayer sends his regards<U+0080><U+009D> why do you think grr martin set it up that way cat is supposed to believe jaime had a hand in her son<U+0080><U+0099>s demise from that statement cat freed jaime so she instantly thinks she<U+0080><U+0099>s killed her own son with her foolish actions she<U+0080><U+0099>s supposed to believe that jaime betrayed her later on in the series but of course viewers will never catch on to this7 lastly sandor  arya<U+0080><U+0099>s story was poorly done here arya was supposed to be desperate trying to get into the twins despite all the bloodshed so that she could see her mother and brother once again the hound somehow managed to knock her out and carry her off unseen without a fret but in the books it<U+0080><U+0099>s a fight for survival frey men attack them and sandor has to kill a few with an axe before arya makes a run for it just as she<U+0080><U+0099>s about to reach the castle the hound hits her atop the head it would have been a much more emotional scene to see arya kicking and screaming as sandor tries to subdue her like it was in a storm of swordsi was so hyped up for this moment ever since i read it in the books i can<U+0080><U+0099>t tell you how immensely let down i am this was meant to be the most significant event in the entire series and i do not feel they did it justice by any means viewers of the show will never know how much better it could have been how much better it should have been i<U+0080><U+0099>m not done with the series but i can definitely say now that i prefer grr martin<U+0080><U+0099>s works over benioff and weiss<U+0080><U+0099>s any day if they would just stick to the damned books instead of making their own changes all the time i<U+0080><U+0099>d be happy cut what you need to but don<U+0080><U+0099>t add things that were never written down by the author that<U+0080><U+0099>s rule no1 of any adaption i can only see this getting worse as the story progresses unless the producers get back on track and start doing things the way they should have done all along i have no more hope left for game of thrones"

"Lord over Seas",2013-06-03,"this is an 8 for me after a long of consideration they failed at capturing the atmosphere which is the thing that really sets this scene apart that catelyn chapter is full of dread from start to finish but they actively went against it and took what to me seemed like the easy way out hide what youre going to do until the last minute to heighten the shock value shock is easy as any number of shlock horror films will reveal controlling the atmosphere unsettling people in subtle ways thats hardtotally agree there with you so many details they forgot which could have set the atmosphere to a great point edmures wife crying during the whole wedding is the first that comes to my mind also whatever happened to greatjon umber i miss his him it seems the writers thought its the same character as blackfish and saved some coin but it seems pretty annoying to me to leave out such a great character and so important in the rw imoon the other hand daenerys scenes where well made as always even having changed the conquest of yunkai i miss belwas too i like the way theyre depicting the growing attraction between the mother of dragons and daario and jorahs implication though i think they could make it a little more subtle they risk to transform this into a sitcom love story like robb with talysa im glad she finally died where it should be all about hidden and repressed attractionsand everything seems to be going fine in the north i like it how they ended the branosha group though brans telechinesis abilities seem to have appeared all of a sudden mainly fault of the previous episodes jons desertion seems a bit hastily made for what i had expected from the previous episodes i never really liked how his relationship was depicted in the series but in the last 2 episodes there was a build up growing in intensity between him and the wildling girl and when i saw the quick fighting and escaping it just felt somewhat anticlimatic 810 imo i liked it in general leaving appart some flaws"

"lostinasia",2013-06-03,"910 mainly because i pretty much dont give perfect scores oh and also because of the giant huh moment when jorah explained how yunkai had been taken glad they didnt show catelyn going into hysterics i dont think that would have translated well to the screen all the actors involved were fantastic wasnt a big fan of the blocking or whatever its called during the massacre both robb and catelyn had almost flyby killers that makes sense because they wanted to focus on the dying stars but still didnt quite work edit just want to say that i mostly thought it was fantastic what ive written above looks a bit too negative  those were nitpicks edited by lostinasia 03 june 2013  0623 am"

"DolorousKim",2013-06-03,"while a good solid and emotionally charged episode it didnt deliver on all that i expected this event to be especially considering that this was the key event that made the producers want to make this adaptation in the first place i gave it an 8what worked for medavid bradleys portrayal of walder frey was mindblowing in its awesomeness in every scene where hes needling rob and his own daughters and granddaughters in the bargain my unsullied husband was laughing out loud and i just sat there thinking dude dont even start liking this character he truly is one of the most despicable pos characters in the whole series yet even knowing how things would turn out i was smiling along too now that is some great acting and the dialogue sure didnt suck eitherrobs asking his mothers advice finally  yes as ran stated in his analysis it was a bit too little too late but still i was glad that this scene was in there as it at least evoked a smidgen of the love and respect that these two characters shared well acted by michelle fairley and richard maddenarya vs the hound tete a tete  maisie williams and rory mccann nailed this scene it was both funny and heartwrenching at the same time funny because boy these two sure know how to push each others buttons heartwrenching because it really did sum up how very close arya was to her one and only desire a reunion with her family yet how she seems destined to never achieve itdeath of grey wind  at first i was pissed that the direwolf was never freed and allowed to go out like a heroic legend but instead was dispatched with no more effort than shooting fish in a barrel on second thought though the emotions evoked by not having the viewer see the actual killing shots but rather just hear the mournful cries of grey wind as he dies was actually more powerful imhowhat didnt work for methey should have saved the scenes in yunkai jon and the wildlings and bran and company in the tower room for another episode each of these events are very important in their own right danys major victory over the slaver city jons abandonment of the wildlings and his escape brans first purposeful warging of both hodor and summer and should have had more time and space to breath here they were wasted in the wake of the red weddingat least one or two scenes establishing robbs relationships to his key bannermenwomen would have gone far setting up the emotional devastation of their deaths as things played out seeing random northmen getting butchered really didnt have any where near the emotional impact it should have had and only contributed to the overall savagery of the eventrobb and talisas baby naming scene  i know why the scene was included but it came off as being really cliched and unnecessary to mecats catatonia  since jinglebell was never introduced i guess it made sense to substitute lord walders young wife but it still seemed to hit a false note to me but more importantly where was the face rending or her protestations not to cut her hair as ned always loved it having her stand mute and catatonic as her throat was cut was yet another choice that significantly dampened the emotional impact of the final scenei think that this episode falls short of blackwater in the capturing one of the most major events in the asoiaf series it didnt succeed as well in setting up the atmosphere of dread and the overall level of tension nor was its delivery of the actual climax realized as well"

"The Meeraculous Third Reed",2013-06-03,"im somewhat surprised at all the tens in all honesty i tend to agree with much of the official review especially regarding the oh shit its a trap moment in all honesty i found the rw somewhat underwhelming there were a few nice twists stabbing talisa in the womb multiple times was pretty shocking as was catelyn slitting his wifes throat but overall i really didnt feel that much sadness obviously ive read it several times before so the impact might have dulled a bit and perhaps the burning of the tents next week will bring a degree of gravitas to the occasion yet for the most part it really wasnt that effective why is this i think a lot of it simply stems from the fact that i give far less of a shit about show robb show catelyn etc than i do their book counterparts thats a result of two seasons worth of poor characterisation which cannot be saved by piling on the sympathy at the rw the seeds for the rw should have been sowed months prior they werent and that lessened the occasion for me there were other things too grey wind dying like a bitch arya acting so damned calm about the whole thing obviously the scene did its job twitter went apeshit people will probably be shocked i cant help thinking though that it could have been so much better the branrickon scene did far much more for me emotionally than the rw i think the separation was done nicely i liked the way that jojen and meera took a back seat to allow the osharickonbran relationship to flourish all in all i thought that bit was fantastic maybe seeing the attack through summers eyes would have made it even better but meh all the other scenes were fine there is only so much you can do with choreographed swordfights i gave it an 8 i shouldve given it a 7 it was by no means a 10 breaking bad 3x1213 4x13 are tens the wire 2x11 4x1213 is a ten this was not a ten edited by the third reed 03 june 2013  0700 am"

"MysteryNinja",2013-06-03,"im pretty conflicted over this episode it was excellent no doubt about that i was glued to the screen even though i knew what was going to happen in anticipation of the episode i didnt expect them to top the books in terms of impact of the red wedding  i expected a good adaptation nothing more and they delivered it well the got red wedding was more about the shock than the horror or sadness of it i felt as some others said too there were some fun moments that stayed with me the presentation of the frey women arya and the hound with the farmer the guy who played walder frey really seemed to enjoy his role the acting was as always top class in this episode one scene just made me shake my head though the invasion of yunkai i mean hasnt grrm tried to convey in the series that three men going against 10 opponents in reality is not a cue for badass fighting but in most cases for wounding disfigurement or death for the disadvantaged side i thought that scene and the ensuing surprise hes not dead just some splatters was pretty cheap tbh i gave it an 8 because of the above and some other littler irks i was oscillating between 8 and 9 might still go back and change"

"Tywin's Honour",2013-06-03,"i gave it a 710 although i may be criticised i felt that the scene didnt carry the emotional weight of the book it would be nigh impossible to accurately convey the impending dread of cat via her inner monologues particularly with her astute understanding of grey winds apprehension the lack of buildup for robbs bannermen really hurt the scene i feel i always got the impression that freys great hall was actually much larger and subsequently more were slaughtered the amount depicted here was of the number expected at a regular house party as aforementioned i missed the table flipping whilst protecting robb such an action imparted so much credence upon robbs leadership and the loyalty of his men on the plus side cats despair was portrayed perfectly would have liked the face raking but overall well done my phone went off as soon as the episode finished by all my nonreader friends expressing their bewilderment and the bullshit of it all"

"Ferrum Aeternum",2013-06-03,"riveting powerful television the rw scenes were incredibly tense and dramatic with a payoff just as horrifying as what id imagined despite any changes the rest of the episode was outstanding as well its fairly incredible how much they managed to pack into an hour a few minor nitpicks here and there but nothing to get hung up about  1010"

"Gregor's Nancy Boy",2013-06-03,"no it only matters to the people who assume that a robb stark who has never warged before and about whom nobody says that his eyes roll at the moment of his death somehow did a warg level 100 trick and entered grey wind the only evidence is that a continuity error would suggest he had extraordinary physical power and some dialogue that would suggest warg dreams completely different from entering your wolf at the moment of your deathits never been stated by martin but every stark child weve had a pov of has been able to warg into their direwolves with the exception of sansa and thats just because sansas wolf died too early the only reason we never see robb do it is because were always looking through cats perspective we do know that greywind was always at his side though and robb would talk about him often wargs are known to enter their animals bodies once they die weve seen it multiple times in the books and never has a warg died without shifting robb didnt have to be a master warg or even understand what his dreams actually meant to enter the body of greywind upon his deathi also dont know how it is possible to criticize the evident anticonventional and anticlimatic quality of gw dying like he did and arya seeing it and assuming what happens from it as opposed to him being liberated by a westerling and going down fightingrobbs wolf died like he did in the books because either he warged into him like i believe or he felt his master die and fell into a rage greywind was a fierce northern beast who went out like a southron poodle in the show"
"Snookson",2013-06-03,"ill preface this by saying i gave this episode a 10 there were several nitpicky things that bugged me but those were lost in my awe for the great adaptation of the rw i was really worried going into this episode that they would rush it or it wouldnt be as severe as the books or they would dramatically change some aspect of the murders i feel like dd did just about as good of a job as the could considering the limitations and format of the current show things i loved the humorous lines and quips towards the beginning of the event showed just how clueless the northmen were how they spaced out the drama during the rw it wasnt just one long scene but an event throughout the episode the shutting of the door and the rains of castamere cats slow realization and rooses sly glances at her and robb cats acting just wow brilliant i was surprised how much i cared about talisas murder i really didnt care for her character in the show at all but the brutality with which she is stabbed while being pregnant just caught me off guard i think i audibly gasped the carnage was just perfect in keeping true to the goriness of the book glad they didnt sugarcoat anything things i thought could have been improved the biggest peeve i had with the scene was that the northmen did not fight back at all i know they were caught by surprise and had no weapons but it was the same in the books and they still managed a small counter attack where was the greatjon clubbing people in the head with chunks of meat where was the table being flipped over to use as a shield with crossbow quarrels flew around i would have liked a little resistance would have liked a little bit more of the dread seeping into cats mind where was the spurned dance which originally led to catelyns discomfort or looking around and noticing the moderate freys all missing from the hall which brings me to also realizing that we didnt get to see any of the frey broods unease rooses driveby knifing was kind of strange also missed the annoying discordant music and poor fare it is a small detail but goes along with the slow ramping up of the feeling that something is wrong i dont know if roslyn wasnt informed of the plan but she seemed a bit too happy to me also i am hoping we will see the large part of robbs army being slaughtered outside the walls in the next episode i realize i am nitpicking here these are simply observations i dont understand people questioning robbs lack of sadness or emotion at the death of his pregnant wife he was just completely taken by surprise by freys hostility after seemingly offering them his hospitality and protection that is something that was never broken a sacred vow he was clearly in shock i thought it was played nicely now dont get me wrong i loved the episode that is why i gave it a 10 that being said i hated the yunkai sneak attack that jorah grey worm and daario pulled off seriously what the hell was that i felt like i was watching power rangers and they get flooded by a huge number of guards yet come back to say they just threw down their weapons despite outnumbering the attackers over tenfold weird aryas scenes with the hound were great didnt really care for jon and the wildlings scenes would have liked a little more recognition with the dire wolves on the other hand if he didnt high tail it out of there he would have been cut down or shot bran and co i was actually surprised with that is one story that i havent cared much for thus far but i enjoyed the scenes in the last episode rickon speaks out of nowhere 2 things that made my laugh my ass off during the episode yer a wizard sammy yer a warg branny edited by snookson 03 june 2013  0332 pm"

"Blind Beth the Cat Lady",2013-06-04,"obviously there were a lot of changes from book to screen in this episode i gave it a nine but the point deducted was not for the rw i think the rw worked perfectly in terms of achieving what it was trying achieve as a scene in a tv show there were several things from the book including cat clawing her face that i was really not looking forward to i was afraid the scene would be played for cringeworthy shockandgore horror value and while it was shocking i think dd were trying hard to play it for its tragic emotional value and purposely avoiding certain horror story elements i really approve of this personally also i think having the terrible booming music would have run a serious risk of telegraphing too clearly what was about to happen in the book it just came across as freys being petty but since its episode 9 the audience knows something is going to happen whereas in the book its just there in the middle as if its going to be a stepping stone to a later development and i think that using the vaguesenseofdreadinducing elements that a lot of people are disappointed were left out would have very possibly given too much of the game away up front in conclusion i give the rw itself a 1010 however i had a problem with the aryahound interaction i think their dynamic in this episode and last episode has been a bit too equal and buddyish we dont get a sense than arya is in one whit of danger from the hound which is quite different from the book book arya wouldnt have talked back to the hound so much and book hound wouldnt have put up with it if shed tried a lot of aryas character development stems from the fact that she spends so much time being powerless at harrenhall with the brotherhood and also with the hound and a lot of the hounds character during this part of the story is him being a total loose cannon arya hates him but shes forced to tread lightly around him in the show they talk a lot of smack to each other but mostly it feels like theyre just reluctant road buddies who get on each others nerves rather than a very vulnerable captive and her drunken murdery shorttempered captor as for danys biti dont blame anyone for this and didnt deduct any points or anything but i feel like were getting to the point where her storyline is going to suffer from not having the funds to make huge set pieces every episode everything that happened with her this episode would fit on a sound stage whereas in the book we frequently get descriptions of danny looking out over sweeping vistas or up at huge walls and pyramids we havent even gotten a look at more than a handfull of unsullied at one time since they marched out of astapor again i understand thats how it has to be because its a tv show and not lord of the rings but the fact that they talk about all these huge armies and cities and then we only see like five people and a few hundred square feet of space at once makes it feel a little surreal and claustrophobic"

"DolorousKim",2013-06-05,"im somewhat surprised at all the tens in all honestyi tend to agree with much of the official review especially regarding the oh shit its a trap moment in all honesty i found the rw somewhat underwhelming there were a few nice twists stabbing talisa in the womb multiple times was pretty shocking as was catelyn slitting his wifes throat but overall i really didnt feel that much sadness obviously ive read it several times before so the impact might have dulled a bit and perhaps the burning of the tents next week will bring a degree of gravitas to the occasion yet for the most part it really wasnt that effectivewhy is this i think a lot of it simply stems from the fact that i give far less of a shit about show robb show catelyn etc than i do their book counterparts thats a result of two seasons worth of poor characterisation which cannot be saved by piling on the sympathy at the rw the seeds for the rw should have been sowed months prior they werent and that lessened the occasion for me there were other things too grey wind dying like a bitch arya acting so damned calm about the whole thing obviously the scene did its job twitter went apeshit people will probably be shocked i cant help thinking though that it could have been so much betterthe branrickon scene did far much more for me emotionally than the rw i think the separation was done nicely i liked the way that jojen and meera took a back seat to allow the osharickonbran relationship to flourish all in all i thought that bit was fantastic maybe seeing the attack through summers eyes would have made it even better but meh all the other scenes were fine there is only so much you can do with choreographed swordfightsi gave it an 8 i shouldve given it a 7 it was by no means a 10 breaking bad 3x1213 4x13 are tens the wire 2x11 4x1213 is a ten this was not a tenive been dying to respond to this but the internet keeps eating my posts tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp   great analysis youve summed up what i was feeling far more succinctly than i have been able to manage i completely agree with what youve written particularly the part regarding bran and rickons parting evoking more of an emotional response than the red weddingwhen i see the many posts proclaiming that this is the best episode of the series im left feeling a bit confounded heck its not even my favorite episode of the season i liked kissed by fire and and now his watch is ended better to me it doesnt even hold a candle to blackwater or baelor and your post perfectly captures why i feel this way"
"ServantOnIce",2013-06-05,"9 out of 10 i thought the yunkai scenes were mis placed and did not fit into the episode at all i also wanted ygritte to shoot jon snow with an arrow on a personal level also could have done a better job with building the wedding tension for us book readers blackwater and baelor still stand out as the show at its best the best episode of the season still remains and now his watch has ended followed by second sons both perfect 10s imo"
"ebevan91",2013-06-05,"i lowered my rating a point i gave it a 10 but upon rewatch i gave it a 9 almost gave it an 8"
"Ser  Vogler",2013-06-05,"10 even that i imagined the wedding would be in a bigger hall most of things were included but with more time they could had the rainy way to twins greywinds foreshadowing and more  big tends were the north soldiers could have been burned alive  smalltalk robb with his leading staff to bring more depth  the discussion between robb and roose about theon  let the red flow  greatjon umber is taking 2mans down with him and most overall i was a bit disappointed about the overall atmosphere they should have eaten something poorly which didnt taste so good they music should have performed more bad than good but i understand the money and time issues an other thing is i still can have both sides the show and the book  they differentiate and thats ok to me edited by ser vogler 05 june 2013  0853 am"

"Tyria Targaryen",2013-06-07,"ive seen it a second time now and ill have to raise my original vote to a 10in the rains of castamere i knew the red wedding was coming but i found the visual medium much more successful for me at building the tension and really revealing the horror of the scene i found the sense of foreboding almost overwhelming largely because of the way that they broke the scene up and intercut with other scenes but then kept coming back over and over to the same event in the same place and then of course there was david bradleys terrific and perverse performance as walder frey he creeped me out much more on screen than he did in the book and he creeped me out in the book the twins felt depraved and claustrophobic and we kept coming back over and over and over again so yeah i thought the structure of the episode did a great job of building tension it just did it in a completely different way than the book did itokay now im going to say something not for the purpose of starting a catelyn argument but just simply for the purpose of stating how successful i think this episode was i do not like catelyn stark and no its not about jon basically we just have a really serious personality conflict winkpng classbbcemoticon alt when i first read the red wedding i really didnt feel a thing for catelyn i felt for robb i felt for grey wind i felt for the northern army and i was angry at the freybolton betrayal angry later when i learned of the treatment of the bodies angry at the atrocity itself and the violation of hospitality laws but i did not feel anything for catelynmichelle fairleys performance though did make me feel for catelyn it was a performance powerful enough that it put me right there and made me experience the horror that catelyn was experiencing i know thats supposed to be my experience when i read the chapter in the book but it didnt happen for me on second viewing btw i felt more for catelyn than i felt the first timeid call that a powerful performance and a powerful episode edited by tyria targaryen 07 june 2013  1223 am"

"lostinasia",2013-06-08,"you will notice they didnt give us patchface or lollys to say nothing of jinglebellwhich is probably my main point no fools in the show because itd look bad to have that going on week after week itd also be an extra complication that doesnt seem particularly necessary and no jinglebell because there are no fools adding jinglebell as the very first fool really seen in the show would just seem odd youd have to add explanation of whats going on grabbing freys wife easy almost no exposition beyond ill kill your wife required adding jinglebell too much explanation required"
"Herb",2013-06-08,"id give it 910 though there were a few minor details i would have liked to of seen included from the books cannot question the overall quality of the episode talisas stabbing was quite a pleasant surprise being a book reader i knew what was to transpire and figured that she would die but not in such a brutal way really think it set the tone brilliantly for the final minutes of the episode and was the main reason for the huge reaction that followed that episode"
"Anarchosaurus Rex",2013-06-08,"it has taken me some time to summon up the strength to venture here to discuss the rains of castamere i was totally devastated after the red wedding in a storm of swords and was absolutely dreading this episode in fact at the time the red wedding ruined the entire series for me although i finished the remaining books my heart was no longer in them yes i was confident that the lannisterfreybolton axis would get what it deserved in the end but the destruction of evil is a hollow victory without the protection of the good and robb and catelyn were so good robb was just a young man fighting bravely for justice for his father and freedom for his people yet he was betrayed by his own men and died defenseless no cause that noble nor man that honorable deserved such a cruel fate catelyn was a loving mother whose sole desire was to protect her children and reunite her family yet she died utterly hopeless believing them all to be dead or captured all those brave men of the north and riverlands who won inspiring victories on the battlefield were ingloriously massacred grey wind robbs loyal companion was slaughtered while powerless caged in a pen the subsequent mutilation of robb catelyn and grey winds corpses added insult to injury it is one thing to be a turncloak but another to be savage and sadistic all robb did was fight for justice and freedom and for that he was murdered and mutilated why obviously therefore i had high expectations for the rains of castamere and it exceeded them all the shock of the red wedding was executed perfectly walter frey was introduced as a repulsive but harmless dirty old man who may have been nursing a personal grudge over robbs violation of his oath but whose bitterness had been placated by robbs amends the little trick walder played on edmure withholding his most beautiful daughter until the wedding ceremony deepened the impression that all was well lulling us into a false sense of security the wedding feast was jovial as well with robb talisa blackfish and roose wearing a smug selfsatisfied smirk all socializing and planning for a future that would never be and then the mournful melody of the rains of castamere began and the suspense began to build grey wind howled plaintively in his pen trying desperately to warn robb of the danger he sensed the fear catelyn felt upon seeing a frey lock the door to the hall and as she rolled up rooses sleeve to find chainmail was palpable during all this my heart was thundering in my chest the horror of the red wedding was executed perfectly as well the gutting of talisa whose character remains a bizarre deviation from the much simpler and sweeter story of jeyne westerling was one of the grisliest deaths i have ever seen so much so that i actually cringed robb the heroic boyking who could not be defeated on the battlefield was suddenly riddled with crossbow bolts catelyn his loving mother was shot in the back grey wind was shot to death while struggling to break free after grey winds dying moan all my mother could do was whimper what catelyns final confrontation with walder while robb gazed into the dead eyes of talisa was heartbreaking even though catelyns death was not nearly as creepy as in the book her savagely sawing into jinglebells neck clawing at her face and laughing maniacally her empty hopeless expression was just as powerful other than the red wedding the rains of castamere was still one of the greatest episodes ever bran and rickon had their most interesting scene since the introduction of the reeds jon finally showed where his loyalties lied this was an episode of characters crossing paths and parting ways 1 bran rickon and jon 2 jon and ygritte 3 arya catelyn and robb also there was action in every storyline too jorah daario and grey worm showed us some jedilike moves while fighting in yunkai jons you were right the whole time line made me grin almost as big as kit harrington was onscreen it was really nice to see direwolves so often throughout the episode even if one of them died horrifically all in all a triumph the source of this episodes success was in its loyalty to the source material which will always be vastly superior to whatever bright ideas dd concoct i am not as familiar with the other storylines but i recognized a lot of direct quotes from the book at the red wedding also there was no gratuitous nudity crowding out the story still i have to give credit where credit is due dd should be very proud of the rains of castamere it should be right up there with you win or you die the pointy end baelor and blackwater the only way the rains of castamere could have been improved is if dd had done a better job of introducing more of robbs bannermen along the way part of the horror of the red wedding is the sheer desperation of robbs men as they fight for their lives and their king moments such as smalljon umber flipping a table atop robb to shield him from crossbows while fighting freys with nothing but a haunch of mutton or dacey mormont smashing a goblet of wine into a freys face were sadly missing from the red wedding greatjon disappeared after season 1 and the only other bannermen we ever met were rickard karstark and roose bolton"

"Sun and Moon",2013-06-09,"i really didnt want to jump online and offer a kneejerk reaction and so ive given my self a week and watched the ep again words fail me as to how disappointed i still feel as much as im an avid reader i understand that concessions and compromises must be made in the attempt to bring this epic story to the screen some i have approved of some not so much for me it all came down to tone and mood my initial impression on reading the scene was one of impending doom the only bright ray if one could call it that was edmures and roslins reaction to each other but even that began to strike a bitter chord as it became increasingly apparent that it was more than the thought of the bedding that was troubling her even the jons drinking for all its humour was ringing alarm bells loudly in my ears the feast itself should have felt nothing short of miserable now i know that much of my take was based on cats internal dialogue and obviously that is something that would have been very hard to get across on screen but i just felt that cats observations were a tad too little too late even the chain mail reveal didnt exactly sit well with me i just cant shirk the opinion that the screenplay reduced the scene to its lowest common denominator it was almost enough to make me wish i was viewing the events for the first time as unsullied viewers did edit silly me ive become so completely despondent again ive forgotten to dole out praise where i feel its due kudos for the way the branhodor warg was handled given that there hasnt been too much emphasis until now on the stark kids warging abilities i thought this was an excellent primer for the viewers although they were probably so gutted by the rw that the full realisation of what brans ability might mean in the long run might have been temporarily shifted to the back of their minds jojens dialogue did much to confirm the scale of brans achievement which i think was sorely needed edited by sun and moon 09 june 2013  0213 am"

"Rashtibram",2013-06-09,"everything was great except for daenerys i cant help but feel they should have moved her storyline forward her episode 7 scene in episode 6 replacing theon then the second sons part in episode 7 would have made the episode a lot better and then the battle in episode 8 in this episode her scenes felt rushed particularly the last scene and it didnt nearly do the battle justice also seeing the 3 fighting styles was cool but otherwise what was the point of that scene they just kept getting attacked by guards would have been better if it had shown them fighting some guards near the main gate and then opening it for the army besides that though a fantastic episode the two big things the rw and queenscrown were both nailed in my opinion and rickon and osha leaving bran was really sad art parkinson wow i also loved aryas bits though something felt a bit off i feel like maisie was given some very clunky lines and only her acting saved the scene from sounding cheesy im thinking especially her line with i know a killer"

"Beric175",2014-02-15,"i think the internet has spoken and overall it was extremely moving they really did put the emphasis on walders misogyny by first insulting robbs wife then joking about his daughter having the pregant mother stabbed and finally not caring about his own wie at all which also makes him a huge hypocrite knowing that supposedly this all happened because robb did not marry one of his daughters about whom he clearly does not care one bit i liked that we were first shown what guest right was instead of having mr exposition comein and tell us all about it and the significance of it was revealed in episode 10 by bran anyway so welldone itll make for a great rewatch knowing all the datails now  i think the way this wedding was adapted was entirely intentional because tyrions wedding while being awkward ended in as happy a way as possible given the circumstances whereas here they played the rw as a much more enjoyable affair at the beginning but with as bad an outcome as one can imagine its a nice contrast and in an episode that jumps around to different characters if you buld up tension at the wdding its forgotten about by the audience once you switch over to a different character and if theyd staged the whole episode at teh twins people would have thought something was up so in that sense its a great adaptation of these events having robb and his men and direwolf not fight back seemled also to be a way for them to take away the viewers hope that much more effectively because they are killed whilst being completely helpless which adds to the sympathy we feel for them as characters and the episode clearly did not want us to feem that there was any upside to this which even the book did not do because there at least we were told that the northmen defended themselves valiantly but clearly the feeling of hopelessness is more important here which i have no problem with at all i wonder if the talisa stabbing was a nod to dacey mormonts death by axe in the belly or not "

"alexislalas",2013-06-02,"loved this episode my favorite in the series so far the rw is also one of my favorite chapters in the book and was really anxious to see how the adapted it and i think they did a great job they found a a proper way to get the blackfish out of the wedding so his story line wont change also including talisa in the rw keeps everything on track about no loose ends regarding the heirs of winterfell and the whole westerling thing i liked how arya was there to see how grey wind was killed i think it makes her character grow even more in this ragevengance situation maybe i was expecting a little more fighting from the stark party and of course got the chills when he sends robb the lannisters regards the jon snowbran part was also well adapted i was also waiting for how they were going to show it and i liked the way how they approach the tower and how he manages to escape i was waiting for ygritte to shoot the arrow but i dont think they want to get to that subplot of jon being injured and never expected him to have orells eagle scratch his face nice move of finding a way to include that in the show and finally bran and rickon split loved the face of jorah mormont when daenerys asks him about darrio naharis after taking yunkai sad next week will be the last episode sadpng classbbcemoticon alt "

"Zman1863",2013-06-02,"it was excellently done i thought the substitution of freys wife in place of jinglebell was smartly done fools should be pruned from tv whenever possible and it fit freys had so many wives that to cast one away would be nothing to him as to kill a lackwit grandson i also think having talissa present was a nice touch that bit of new imagery made the scene that much more traumatic and gets rid of a loose end that has been a creative weak spot for a while liked the bran and company scenes a lot they were overdue to show bran start using his powers voluntarily the jon scenes were also good though i laughed out loud when the eagle was on top of him it looked like a stuffed animal i had to go to the bathroom for some of the dany stuff so ill watch that again i needed some beer to fortify myself for the finale"

"Prince of Dragonstone",2013-06-03,"my opinion is they will have a really hard time coming up with interesting and action packed episodes on those 2 seasons which unfortunetly may cause hbo to not have enough interest in making seasons 7 and 8 for the twow things get even uglier if you consider that grrm may not be able to finish book 7 by 2018  which would probably mean the end of the seriesgrrm originally wrote affc and dwd as one huge novel but the publishers made him split it into two books so its safe to assume that the show is going to blend the storylines for both and stretch it over seasons 5 and 6 they couldnt possibly have a season 5 without dany jon or tyrion i also think that the show will greatly and mercifully edit down much of briennes loooooong travelogue storyline from affc the audience will definitely not tolerate some extended storyline of brienne aimlessly wandering around the riverlands looking for sansa when they know sansa is at the eyrie with littlefinger that storyline was pointless in the book and will be doubly pointless on television"

"Gregor's Nancy Boy",2013-06-03,"these are my complaints there are a lot of them let me begin by saying this is my least favorite episode of the entire series and i am utterly disappointed benioff and weiss were the whole reason i started reading a song of ice and fire to begin with game of thrones inspired me to pick up a novel and finish it for the very first time in my nineteen years of life that novel in turn inspired me to read four more after that i trusted them completely with this the red wedding was their ultimate goal in the series and theyve said it from the start i am still in disbelief that they would butcher it so badly but i digress onto business1 robbs arrival at the twins was an event in and of itself his arrival and his death should have been spread out between two episodes as it was in the books with two successive catelyn chapters the entire event happened way too fast for those who have not read the books greywind robb<U+0080><U+0099>s direwolf who has been largely missing from the show until randomly appearing in a kennel this episode attacks some freys in the rain as they greet the starks to their castle robb going through great pains to appease walder frey decides to chain his trusty direwolf outside not in a damned dog kennel throughout their time at the twins greywind howls in despair sensing what is to come2 blackfish  jeyne talisa are supposed to be safe at riverrun not at the twins with robb  catelyn jeyne is still alive in the books supposedly with robb<U+0080><U+0099>s unborn child an entire plot element currently hinges on whether or not that child is a boy she should not have been killed off i<U+0080><U+0099>m surprised they didn<U+0080><U+0099>t kill the blackfish as well how do they explain what he was even doing while his niece and great nephew king were being slaughtered i suppose he has magically escaped the castle and all the carnage outside to return to riverrun where he will most certainly be needed in the future for jaime<U+0080><U+0099>s scenes3 greywind dies after robb this is extremely important sentimentallywise as robb<U+0080><U+0099>s real last words are <U+0080><U+009C>greywind<U+0080><U+0080><U+009D> not <U+0080><U+009C>mother<U+0080><U+0080><U+009D> it is to be assumed robb wargs into his direwolf after he dies since this is the same moment greywind viciously attacks nearby freys who have not yet began their assault robb is betrayed killed by his own man wargs into his wolf then dies all over again it is part of his death and cutting that out of the show makes it considerably less tragic to match the death they gave greywind here was so lacking in dramatic force or quality you barely even cared that he was killed4 another thing that makes robb<U+0080><U+0099>s death less bleak is his childish disgruntlement towards walder frey throughout the episode at this point in the books robb is genuinely sorry for what he did to his house and wants to make amends he sustains every slight walder throws at him without a flinch and handles himself extremely well at the twins in the face of every petulant frey it<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to feel sorry for him here with those petty school boy heroics5 most of the deaths in this episode were incredibly underwhelming compared to the deaths in a storm of swords this was for many reasons unfortunately first of all overly dramatic music was being played over everything when we should have been treated to nothing but the rains of castamere slowly digressing into the boom doom boom of the musicians<U+0080><U+0099> drums secondly robb<U+0080><U+0099>s actor did an absolutely horrible job at displaying any sort of confusion shock fear or despair i heard he cried after he discovered how his character was to be killed but you never would have guessed he actually cared from his performancecatelyn<U+0080><U+0099>s actor was more than capable of carrying out some of the horrific things grr martin described in his books but for whatever reason benioff and weiss decided to stray for something far drabber going catatonic may sound like a proper reaction to the soul crushing sight of what you think is your only surviving child being killed in front of you but when cat<U+0080><U+0099>s scream fades out and she just stands there motionless it doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t deliver the jarring reaction her death deserves it looks more as if she just accepts it and stops struggling in the books she scratches her face to ribbons as she screams bloody murder and the freys waste no time in apprehending her by the hair as her braid is yanked back she thinks <U+0080><U+009C>no not my hair ned loves my hair<U+0080><U+009D> this would have been absolutely perfect had those been her last words she literally goes mad with grief but viewers simply can<U+0080><U+0099>t grasp the extent of that grief without lines such as thisjeyne<U+0080><U+0099>s talisa<U+0080><U+0099>s death besides being totally uncanon took away from the relationship between mother and son it wasn<U+0080><U+0099>t supposed to be about jeyne or robb<U+0080><U+0099>s child it was supposed to be about catelyn and her child this is the relationship we had come to understand indepth from cat<U+0080><U+0099>s perspective since the first book jeyne<U+0080><U+0099>s family were also supposed to be suspected conspirators in the red wedding their daughter was not planned to be killed along with the starks despite jeyne<U+0080><U+0099>s alleged devotion to robb as i mentioned before a huge plot element hinges on her and her baby by the fifth book blackfish holds riverrun against the lannisters with jeyne tight under guard he defends her with his life why would he do this if not to protect an heir now what are they going to come up with when grr martin reveals jeyne is pregnant with the king in the north<U+0080><U+0099>s sonforget the main characters for a second part of the horror of the red wedding was that so many people you were starting to like were all being slaughtered like farm animals it is too much to expect to see minor characters such as dacey mormont and smalljon umber but surely their roles could have been replaced with existing characters in the show characters who in the books did not matter much lopping off the greatjon<U+0080><U+0099>s head in place of his son<U+0080><U+0099>s would have been an excellent deviation as the greatjon is supposed to be held captive then hardly ever mentioned again instead we watch a bunch of bearded men who we<U+0080><U+0099>ve never even seen before being killed in humdrum fashions no crossbow bolts through the mouth no beheadings none of thati doubt it would have had an impact anyway since the gore in this episode was completely unrealistic and tainted by hollywood action movies people do not instantly lose consciousness when their throat is cut then fall to the floor dead when your esophagus is severed you lose the ability to breathe through your mouthnose and begin breathing out of a hole in your neck this is largely impossible though since the wound bleeds profusely clogging your esophagus with fluids you essentially drown on your own blood in a panic making all sorts of horrible snorting noises for up to three minutes i<U+0080><U+0099>m not even sure grr martin was aware of this before writing the red wedding but slitting throats was never described as one fell graze upon the neck catelyn sawed through this person<U+0080><U+0099>s throat until they died stabbing a person in their heart is another matter but looks like bolton missed the mark roose had a tiny dagger in place of a longsword and apparently decided to stab robb in the lower part of his lung causing instant death<U+0080> while all this is happening inside the castle the stark host outside is supposed to be burning to death by the masses as a result of giant feast tents rigged to catch fire and collapse on top of them rather than depict the elaborate trap grr martin conceived it is simply implied all the stark men outside are put to the sword good thing the viewers have no idea how many stark men there are in comparison to bolton men or else they would surely question the effectiveness of an open armed conflict 6 roose<U+0080><U+0099>s performance here was a huge disappointment i was setting my expectations high assuming this actor would be the one to do everything right i was thoroughly enjoying his portrayal of the leech lord up until this point he seemed so smug whereas in the books he barely made an attempt to talk to anyone he played his part perfectly while most of the freys were a nervous wreck but he was never cheeky about it here he looks like he<U+0080><U+0099>s taking great pleasure in taunting the starks as if he hates them roose is a man who plays for the winning team and takes no particular joy in betrayal he just accepts that it<U+0080><U+0099>s practical and carries out his atrocities without guilt in addition to screwing up his behavior the actor got his body movements all wrong as well roose is supposed to glide in and out of the hall as confident and smooth as can be here he darts around ducking his head and lunging out of harm<U+0080><U+0099>s way it<U+0080><U+0099>s just so unlike the lord of the dreadfort but most importantly he says to robb just before he stabs him <U+0080><U+009C>the lannisters send their regards<U+0080><U+009D> i<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry but why did you change that from <U+0080><U+009C>the kingslayer sends his regards<U+0080><U+009D> why do you think grr martin set it up that way cat is supposed to believe jaime had a hand in her son<U+0080><U+0099>s demise from that statement cat freed jaime so she instantly thinks she<U+0080><U+0099>s killed her own son with her foolish actions she<U+0080><U+0099>s supposed to believe that jaime betrayed her later on in the series but of course viewers will never catch on to this7 lastly sandor  arya<U+0080><U+0099>s story was poorly done here arya was supposed to be desperate trying to get into the twins despite all the bloodshed so that she could see her mother and brother once again the hound somehow managed to knock her out and carry her off unseen without a fret but in the books it<U+0080><U+0099>s a fight for survival frey men attack them and sandor has to kill a few with an axe before arya makes a run for it just as she<U+0080><U+0099>s about to reach the castle the hound hits her atop the head it would have been a much more emotional scene to see arya kicking and screaming as sandor tries to subdue her like it was in a storm of swordsi was so hyped up for this moment ever since i read it in the books i can<U+0080><U+0099>t tell you how immensely let down i am this was meant to be the most significant event in the entire series and i do not feel they did it justice by any means viewers of the show will never know how much better it could have been how much better it should have been i<U+0080><U+0099>m not done with the series but i can definitely say now that i prefer grr martin<U+0080><U+0099>s works over benioff and weiss<U+0080><U+0099>s any day if they would just stick to the damned books instead of making their own changes all the time i<U+0080><U+0099>d be happy cut what you need to but don<U+0080><U+0099>t add things that were never written down by the author that<U+0080><U+0099>s rule no1 of any adaption i can only see this getting worse as the story progresses unless the producers get back on track and start doing things the way they should have done all along i have no more hope left for game of thrones"

"MegaMagick",2013-06-03,"as a book reader i was pretty much on the edge of my seat the entire episode i knew exactly what was coming it didnt disappoint either in fact the scene looked almost exactly how i pictured it in my head even to how roslin frey looked once they showed her face i was like robb you stupid motherfucker because i knew he was going to get it and i realized that he didnt even look at any of freys daughters to begin with you could almost see it in his eyes when he saw her like man i fucked up he swore an oath to frey that he would marry one of his daughters and a oathvow in general is sacredparticularly in those times but the oath of a king is huge walder frey took it as the last straw the final spit in the face and decided that he was going to take vengeance on the people who pissed on him for so long not saying what frey did was justified but robb made a lot of stupid decisionsthat irony of which that most of them were decisions his father never wouldve made and either one of them couldve came back to cost him his life final thoughts on the scene and i know this will sound terrible but i kinda laughed when catelyn got her throat slit at the end there was the long pause and then this guy comes up and then cuts and fade to credits as for the other stuff 1 i liked the banter between arya and the hound theres great chemistry between the two 2 im starting to like jon again i like how he gutted the warg and basically told him to screw off things are about to go down on the wall which makes me think of how much theyve mishandled mance i almost forgot he existed 3 brans story has finally become semi interesting again but you know i actually think the show focusing on the wild adventures of rickon and osha would be more interesting than all the warg crap but it will never happen this and blackwater are the two best episodes of the show and i think the next season will have even greater moments"

"Dormund of Ruddy Hall",2013-06-04,"loved the episode my only nitpicks regard the dramatization of queenscrown the problem with adapting any beloved literature to screen is that everyone has a different imagination and therefore no adaptation will play exactly the same on screen as it does in every readers mind the duty ot the viewer is to trust the adaptation as the way that the story played out in the mind of the screenwriter and as the result of inevitable compromises related to the directors vision the cinematographers camera the actors portrayals and the limits imposed on the whole affair by budgets weather and the like i really appreciate what the whole production is doing with the story and understand that their vision is different than minethat said my nitpick about queenscrown is that i wish the tower had been bigger and had been located in a lake with a submerged causeway leading to it the tower used in the episode looked a lot like the windmill the wildlings encountered earlier in the season i pictured something like these watchtowers near the cliffs of mohr in ireland but on a small island in a small lakehttp4bpblogspotiffscastlejpgclouds overhead the whole scene could have been moodier and more tense than it wasagain just a nitpick location scouts arent omnipotent perhaps such a location just wasnt available and overall theyve done spendidly this was the best episode of television i think ive ever seen edited by charles kuntz 04 june 2013  0336 am"

"mynameisJamie",2013-06-04,"there would have been no cost issue to give 2 or 3 northerners some screen time this season instead of shae or ros or pod and then have them die heroically at the rwlack of direwolf action is a shame because it robs greywind of the heroic death he had and it reduces the link between the starks and the wolvesi agree the fact that this is the most memorable scene in all of the asoiaf series  it slightly annoys me when i think of all the pointless and boring scenes with certain charactersall it would take is a few actors to play young lords who are seen 23 times through out the seasoncgi money spent on greywind actually being seen with robb the young wolf stark to make the scene better edited by jamie stark 04 june 2013  0748 am"

"larsberg",2013-06-04,"these are my complaints there are a lot of them let me begin by saying this is my least favorite episode of the entire series and i am utterly disappointed benioff and weiss were the whole reason i started reading a song of ice and fire to begin with game of thrones inspired me to pick up a novel and finish it for the very first time in my nineteen years of life that novel in turn inspired me to read four more after that i trusted them completely with this the red wedding was their ultimate goal in the series and theyve said it from the start i am still in disbelief that they would butcher it so badly but i digress onto business1 robbs arrival at the twins was an event in and of itself his arrival and his death should have been spread out between two episodes as it was in the books with two successive catelyn chapters the entire event happened way too fast for those who have not read the books greywind robb<U+0080><U+0099>s direwolf who has been largely missing from the show until randomly appearing in a kennel this episode attacks some freys in the rain as they greet the starks to their castle robb going through great pains to appease walder frey decides to chain his trusty direwolf outside not in a damned dog kennel throughout their time at the twins greywind howls in despair sensing what is to come2 blackfish  jeyne talisa are supposed to be safe at riverrun not at the twins with robb  catelyn jeyne is still alive in the books supposedly with robb<U+0080><U+0099>s unborn child an entire plot element currently hinges on whether or not that child is a boy she should not have been killed off i<U+0080><U+0099>m surprised they didn<U+0080><U+0099>t kill the blackfish as well how do they explain what he was even doing while his niece and great nephew king were being slaughtered i suppose he has magically escaped the castle and all the carnage outside to return to riverrun where he will most certainly be needed in the future for jaime<U+0080><U+0099>s scenes3 greywind dies after robb this is extremely important sentimentallywise as robb<U+0080><U+0099>s real last words are <U+0080><U+009C>greywind<U+0080><U+0080><U+009D> not <U+0080><U+009C>mother<U+0080><U+0080><U+009D> it is to be assumed robb wargs into his direwolf after he dies since this is the same moment greywind viciously attacks nearby freys who have not yet began their assault robb is betrayed killed by his own man wargs into his wolf then dies all over again it is part of his death and cutting that out of the show makes it considerably less tragic to match the death they gave greywind here was so lacking in dramatic force or quality you barely even cared that he was killed4 another thing that makes robb<U+0080><U+0099>s death less bleak is his childish disgruntlement towards walder frey throughout the episode at this point in the books robb is genuinely sorry for what he did to his house and wants to make amends he sustains every slight walder throws at him without a flinch and handles himself extremely well at the twins in the face of every petulant frey it<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to feel sorry for him here with those petty school boy heroics5 most of the deaths in this episode were incredibly underwhelming compared to the deaths in a storm of swords this was for many reasons unfortunately first of all overly dramatic music was being played over everything when we should have been treated to nothing but the rains of castamere slowly digressing into the boom doom boom of the musicians<U+0080><U+0099> drums secondly robb<U+0080><U+0099>s actor did an absolutely horrible job at displaying any sort of confusion shock fear or despair i heard he cried after he discovered how his character was to be killed but you never would have guessed he actually cared from his performancecatelyn<U+0080><U+0099>s actor was more than capable of carrying out some of the horrific things grr martin described in his books but for whatever reason benioff and weiss decided to stray for something far drabber going catatonic may sound like a proper reaction to the soul crushing sight of what you think is your only surviving child being killed in front of you but when cat<U+0080><U+0099>s scream fades out and she just stands there motionless it doesn<U+0080><U+0099>t deliver the jarring reaction her death deserves it looks more as if she just accepts it and stops struggling in the books she scratches her face to ribbons as she screams bloody murder and the freys waste no time in apprehending her by the hair as her braid is yanked back she thinks <U+0080><U+009C>no not my hair ned loves my hair<U+0080><U+009D> this would have been absolutely perfect had those been her last words she literally goes mad with grief but viewers simply can<U+0080><U+0099>t grasp the extent of that grief without lines such as thisjeyne<U+0080><U+0099>s talisa<U+0080><U+0099>s death besides being totally uncanon took away from the relationship between mother and son it wasn<U+0080><U+0099>t supposed to be about jeyne or robb<U+0080><U+0099>s child it was supposed to be about catelyn and her child this is the relationship we had come to understand indepth from cat<U+0080><U+0099>s perspective since the first book jeyne<U+0080><U+0099>s family were also supposed to be suspected conspirators in the red wedding their daughter was not planned to be killed along with the starks despite jeyne<U+0080><U+0099>s alleged devotion to robb as i mentioned before a huge plot element hinges on her and her baby by the fifth book blackfish holds riverrun against the lannisters with jeyne tight under guard he defends her with his life why would he do this if not to protect an heir now what are they going to come up with when grr martin reveals jeyne is pregnant with the king in the north<U+0080><U+0099>s sonforget the main characters for a second part of the horror of the red wedding was that so many people you were starting to like were all being slaughtered like farm animals it is too much to expect to see minor characters such as dacey mormont and smalljon umber but surely their roles could have been replaced with existing characters in the show characters who in the books did not matter much lopping off the greatjon<U+0080><U+0099>s head in place of his son<U+0080><U+0099>s would have been an excellent deviation as the greatjon is supposed to be held captive then hardly ever mentioned again instead we watch a bunch of bearded men who we<U+0080><U+0099>ve never even seen before being killed in humdrum fashions no crossbow bolts through the mouth no beheadings none of thati doubt it would have had an impact anyway since the gore in this episode was completely unrealistic and tainted by hollywood action movies people do not instantly lose consciousness when their throat is cut then fall to the floor dead when your esophagus is severed you lose the ability to breathe through your mouthnose and begin breathing out of a hole in your neck this is largely impossible though since the wound bleeds profusely clogging your esophagus with fluids you essentially drown on your own blood in a panic making all sorts of horrible snorting noises for up to three minutes i<U+0080><U+0099>m not even sure grr martin was aware of this before writing the red wedding but slitting throats was never described as one fell graze upon the neck catelyn sawed through this person<U+0080><U+0099>s throat until they died stabbing a person in their heart is another matter but looks like bolton missed the mark roose had a tiny dagger in place of a longsword and apparently decided to stab robb in the lower part of his lung causing instant death<U+0080> while all this is happening inside the castle the stark host outside is supposed to be burning to death by the masses as a result of giant feast tents rigged to catch fire and collapse on top of them rather than depict the elaborate trap grr martin conceived it is simply implied all the stark men outside are put to the sword good thing the viewers have no idea how many stark men there are in comparison to bolton men or else they would surely question the effectiveness of an open armed conflict 6 roose<U+0080><U+0099>s performance here was a huge disappointment i was setting my expectations high assuming this actor would be the one to do everything right i was thoroughly enjoying his portrayal of the leech lord up until this point he seemed so smug whereas in the books he barely made an attempt to talk to anyone he played his part perfectly while most of the freys were a nervous wreck but he was never cheeky about it here he looks like he<U+0080><U+0099>s taking great pleasure in taunting the starks as if he hates them roose is a man who plays for the winning team and takes no particular joy in betrayal he just accepts that it<U+0080><U+0099>s practical and carries out his atrocities without guilt in addition to screwing up his behavior the actor got his body movements all wrong as well roose is supposed to glide in and out of the hall as confident and smooth as can be here he darts around ducking his head and lunging out of harm<U+0080><U+0099>s way it<U+0080><U+0099>s just so unlike the lord of the dreadfort but most importantly he says to robb just before he stabs him <U+0080><U+009C>the lannisters send their regards<U+0080><U+009D> i<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry but why did you change that from <U+0080><U+009C>the kingslayer sends his regards<U+0080><U+009D> why do you think grr martin set it up that way cat is supposed to believe jaime had a hand in her son<U+0080><U+0099>s demise from that statement cat freed jaime so she instantly thinks she<U+0080><U+0099>s killed her own son with her foolish actions she<U+0080><U+0099>s supposed to believe that jaime betrayed her later on in the series but of course viewers will never catch on to this7 lastly sandor  arya<U+0080><U+0099>s story was poorly done here arya was supposed to be desperate trying to get into the twins despite all the bloodshed so that she could see her mother and brother once again the hound somehow managed to knock her out and carry her off unseen without a fret but in the books it<U+0080><U+0099>s a fight for survival frey men attack them and sandor has to kill a few with an axe before arya makes a run for it just as she<U+0080><U+0099>s about to reach the castle the hound hits her atop the head it would have been a much more emotional scene to see arya kicking and screaming as sandor tries to subdue her like it was in a storm of swordsi was so hyped up for this moment ever since i read it in the books i can<U+0080><U+0099>t tell you how immensely let down i am this was meant to be the most significant event in the entire series and i do not feel they did it justice by any means viewers of the show will never know how much better it could have been how much better it should have been i<U+0080><U+0099>m not done with the series but i can definitely say now that i prefer grr martin<U+0080><U+0099>s works over benioff and weiss<U+0080><U+0099>s any day if they would just stick to the damned books instead of making their own changes all the time i<U+0080><U+0099>d be happy cut what you need to but don<U+0080><U+0099>t add things that were never written down by the author that<U+0080><U+0099>s rule no1 of any adaption i can only see this getting worse as the story progresses unless the producers get back on track and start doing things the way they should have done all along i have no more hope left for game of thrones i was also a little disappointed with the rw it didnt hit me as much as the book didbut i wouldnt dismiss benioff and weiss rewriting yet because they also added amazing scenes which were not in the books eg chair sequence with the small council mill dialog between rob  edmundas good as the writing of rr martin is after sos and the killing of tywin the story goes downhill it felt like lost after season 3 the story is going in circels and there are many new characters added for them i cant care lessif benioff and weiss can improve on that everything is forgiven"

"ViserionsFire",2013-06-04,"i feel like we must have been watching some different version of the rw mine was like in the books primarily from catelyns pov and focused on the desperate attempt of a mother to save her childlets say that greywind gets out and kills a few freys before he is shot down how does that change anything or make the outcome any better if anything it is even worse because you get the few seconds of hope were you think that maybe he will run inside and save robb and cat or at least himself i think grewinds fate exactly mirrored robbs both great fighters but trapped outnumbered and completely powerless against what was comingyes i agree my impression when reading the chapter was that even though robbs bannermen tried to protect him the tragedy was the freys and bolton betrayal and the brutal killing of both robb and cat the amount of expense that hbo would have to shell out to create the book image of the rw would be astronomical i think they did a great job of transferring what the book intent and feeling was to the screen remember there are only a few pages dedicated to the betrayal in the book and the screen time provided opportunities for everyone in the scene to give convincing performances that the scenes focus was primarily on cat allowed her to give a terrific performance in revealing first her anger then her desperation and eventually turning numb with grief i read this chapter a couple of months ago and other than the talisa part i think they really followed the book the part where arya gets within the castle grounds to see how robbs bannermen were killed was different than the the book butthis may add to her characters development which has grown immensely during the past 2 seasons"
"Jory Cassel",2013-06-04,"just from my perspective i didnt really see much of a shift i still saw the scene almost exclusively through catelyns eyes and i saw it as being about family  about catelyn and her children her acceptance of talisa was sort of more hope for her as a mother it means another daughter grandchldren etc it was really the first positive family glimmer shed have in a very long time and then it was all brutally stripped away from herthe book rw did have more on the bannermen but i still saw the scene itself as ultimately being about catelyns losses  and ultimately what the stark family had suffered personally  throughout the series the aftermath of it is when the politics sunk in more at least for me im fine with them keeping the focus primarily on the family for emotional impact and having the political repercussions being the longerlasting issuedont get me wrong i liked the interaction between robb and cat very much i think that part war realized extremely well fairleys acting was greatyet it just felt like there was something missing all the loyalists going down in just a few seconds somehow felt wrong and the impression of completechaos i got while reading just wasnt there in the way i imagined it"

"Blackf1sh",2013-06-04,"i think the rw was really well done my only problem was the ease and fastness in which the northern nobility read extras was killed i can understand the directors decision to do it fast and ruthless like this since the impact was really huge and showed that robb absolutely had no chance of escaping but i remember from the chapter in the book that at least a few northern lords tried to protect their king and this opportunity to show that was really wasted also i really imagined the hound knocking arya down to be a bit more dramatic if i remember correctly the hound did kill some frey soldiers before he reached arya running into the twins but hopefully we will see something similar in the final episode when the stark camp is attacked and burned and hopefully also see what happens to the blackfish"

"A Man Has Said",2013-06-04,"the thing is walder frey in cats words is a dangerous man to cross right robb needed him though and made vows to get what he wants but even though robb was warned he still breaks his vows and as i understand noble families have always spat on the freys you dont do that to a man who is known to be dangerous and holds something very essential to your cause men and the bridge this doesnt approve the violation of guest right and the massacre of rw but walder frey got his excuse to betray him and a sly man he is he betrays him when he knows he gets protection from tywinand roose i think the starks have never trusted boltons got the expression from ned i think robb put too much faith in him when robb looks like he is losing the war roose turns his cloak like ned said about jaime goes well with roose as well you served him well when it was safeas for karstark thing robb decided to execute their lord as is suitable for rickards crimes but if the karstark are half of his army what do you expect them to do when their lord is executed edmure bf and cat they all i think suggested robb to hold him as hostage until the fighting is done but robb decided to behead himi agree that roose and walder frey do not have the courage to turn their cloaks openly so they go do thing like the rwwell old walder certainly feels that noble families have always spat on the freys primarily by refusing to marry his sons daughters and grandchildrenthink about that in context of the expectations that old walder has his targets are such people as edmure tully heir to being lord paramount of the riverlands brynden blackfish the brother of hoster who is lord paramount while walder is trying to catch him and robb stark who is the lord paramount and later king in the north setting his sights kinda high dont you think all these families are well above the freys station theyre just bannermenand what does he have to offer in return with that many kin to marry off none of them individually is going to come with a big dowry or for the men lands and castles of their own youve got a budget for dowries and it has to be split between 40 daughters its not going to go a long wayhow about the higher lords marrying some freys to cement their loyalty that aint going to happen because they have a longheld reputation for treachery perhaps going back to before old walder  a reputation which was set in stone when the late walder frey failed to show up with his host at the trident until it was all over and he knew who had won how much good is that to you in a warwalders disappointment is the same as you or i starting an entry level job flipping burgers and being disappointed that it doesnt come with a company car and an expense account"
"Lord Elrosir",2013-06-04,"think about that in context of the expectations that old walder has his targets are such people as edmure tully heir to being lord paramount of the riverlands brynden blackfish the brother of hoster who is lord paramount while walder is trying to catch himblackfish was never lord paramount of the trident edmure was when hoster died but after the red wedding littlefinger became lord paramount of the trident and lord of harrenhal"

"SpaA<U+009F>vogel",2013-06-04,"it wasnt an arbitrary change they made the episode so it wasnt obvious that something is wrong which means that they remove the tip of that the musicians are bad among some other things i guess it also plays in with the medium since we actually have to listen to the band for quite some time during the showi dont buy that it would tip the hand too much they establish so hard that walder frey is being a jerk hiring a crappy band could just be another dickish move on his part and doesnt necessarily ruin the surprise its still a pretty big leap to slaughter i think the potential aha moment by the audience when they realize why the band is so bad is far more fulfilling outcome and was worth the risk of the probably handful of people who might guess what was coming i mean even if they do guess that its a trap which by the larger context isnt that much of big guess they arent going to fathom the depths and completeness of the slaughter that stuff would still be a shock i think they overplayed the value of the shock and gutted the surreality that leads to it"

"Janicia",2013-06-05,"one of my favorite book lines was arya asking sandor did you hit her sansa with an axe too so i was a little sad that sandor didnt hit arya with an axe this week but bonking her head with his fist made a lot more sense im still sad that arya and gendry didnt have their bar scene i guess aryas book storyline needed those little bits of humor since it was so very dark but throwing in all the humor without all the dark would just make it silly on tv"

"King of the Road",2013-06-05,"if michelle fairley isnt returning for whatever reason then there are really only three plausible options for who takes on the role of lady stoneheart in my opinion 1 talisa stark  probably the most logical option as she has the closest ties to both robb and the red wedding than anyone other than catelyn just as lady stoneheart does she has a distinguishing wound that could be as equally definitive of her character as catelyns cut throat is 2 beric dondarrion  it may be that he feels some guilt regarding his treatment of arya this in addition to a sense of honour and nobility could mean that he desires vengeance on the freys for their actions 3 brynden tully  ive read a lot of speculation that he could be the one to take control of the brotherhood in the wow if this is true then its perfectly logical that he should begin his ties with them now he was also present at the rw and so knows exactly who was responsible whilst his family ties to both catelyn and robb make him an ideal bringer of justice to the freys now obviously these suggestions could create problems regarding briennes storyline as none of them have ever met her  nonetheless i feel that the character is too important to simply cut and so if michelle fairley doesnt return then for me it has to be one of these three for the record i hope that she does come back as lady stoneheart if only because shes been in it since episode 1 and im not ready to say goodbye yet"
"Lady Arwen",2013-06-05,"i will be livid if they omit uncat or replace the stoneheart character with untalisa uncat is a silly gimmick that took me a long time to accept but now i accept it and appreciate it as a diabolical deviation from the noble starks get screwed over by everyone pattern all i ever wanted was for cat to get revenge on the people who decimated her family and she deserves to get that chance as uncat no one else in this series deserves vengeance as much as she doesdefinitely not talisa"

"Rockroi",2013-06-06,"i just watched this episode for the second time to make sure i didnt miss anything i thought it was good and accurately conveyed the horror that was the red wedding i understand that the tv medium can be difficult to translate and the producers are challenged to match anything up to the booksbut am i the only one bummed out that they couldnt show any of the heroics of robbs guys during the massacre i was affected by the killing of robb and catelyn like everyone else but some of the most memorable images from my reading of the chapter were those describing the actions of the smalljon dacey mormont and raynald westerling when everything goes downhill even the image of wendel manderly getting a quarrel through the throat without actually getting up and doing anything was surprising in its own right i was really looking forward to seeing any one of robbs guys throw a table on top of him that immediately gets punctured by crossbow bolts then start whacking guys with turkey legs dacey knocks a guy out with a beer glass before getting taken out i might be picking nits over an altogether excellent episode and i understand that the audience wouldnt have cared about how nameless characters died but i was disappointed in this regardrobb catelyn and talisa werent the only victims the heirs to most of the northern houses got decimatedwell in fairness the freys are butchering a bunch of northernmen the downside is that we dont really know who any of them arei loved the episode i think that most nitpicking is misdirected anger over watching the starks get got and i think tha tthe show creators did a fantastic job in keeping the episode moving and hiding it in plain sightbut sertravisredbeard i agree with you in that i think had the scene contained more elemnts of resistence it would have delivered a greater punch because every act of resistence and heroism for the north would have kindled the flame of false hope thus making the ultimate death all the more impactful i mean the one image that i always remember from the book is when smalljon umber heaves a table on to of robb to protect him from the bolts i always remember thinking okay he saved him when i first read the book but then thinking wait they shot cat people are getting stabbed this is moving fast that tension between hope and reality could have been kindled had they extended that scene just a tad more shown one or two northernment make the desperate and futile attempt to save their king i would have liked thatbut we got a lot in return first everyone is talking about talisas death because of her gruesome end robb  and richard madden is definately the unsung hero of the entire show up to now he played the hellout of robb  is facing his own unimaginable failure his regret his loss his human frailty second grey winds demise was so well done talk about watching hope die third what the episode lacked in false hope and resistence it made up for in raw anger and utter ruin the episode left no doubt that the stark revolution was over and the utter destruction of the north has commenced and i hate to say this but the price of adding in all this stuff would have added in time and money and i think is benioff and weiss have done anything its using their time and money wisely i think they made some really great choices here and while iu stiff think bw skrewed up stannis i think they nailed the red wedding edited by rockroi 06 june 2013  0843 am"
"zaphodbrx",2013-06-06,"i just rewatched the episode and drew some conclusions about troop numbers from robbs map pieces hear me out there are 3 wolf pieces  starks 2 x  bolton  and 4 towers  frey  if we consider each piece to be work 2k soldiers this works out quite neatly starks 6k bolton 4k karstark 8k frey 8k karstarks are 8k by subtracting stark and bolton from the 18k forces after robb sent 2k off to die also it fits very will with the fact that karstarks are nearly half of robbs forces freys are 8k considering four pieces  2k each  and also the fact that robb says that he needs troops to replace karstarks and only walder frey has that sort of army which can match the karstarks  i know this doesnt take into account robbs other bannermen however robb doesnt have any bannermen in the show other than that season1 episode in s2 and s3 he only has karstarks and boltons edit tullys have no significant troops either poor edmure edited by zaphodbrx 06 june 2013  0854 am"

"digiFemme",2013-06-06,"i didnt think the frey girls were that bad looking just plain and somewhat unkempt i like how one of them spoke up when the old man got her name wrong edmure is shallow for wanting a pretty wife but then again hes going through with it despite not wanting to anyway for the sake of his family doesnt matter if his reasons for not wanting the marriage are trivial or justified etc the point is that hes making the sacrifice robb should have made the blackfish comes across as a bully to me but i found his scene the one where the frey women were giving him the look funny the rw was just as horrific as i imagined from the books i only wish the scene outside with arya and the hound was more dramatic not sure but it seemed a little toned down almost as if there were hardly any people around michelle fairley was perfect though and she nailed the episode"

"Winter In My Heart",2013-06-06,"i think robb just realized before her mother that there was no point to keep fighting and give walder frey something to enjoy because they were not going to let him go he could do nothing for himself or for cat nothing not even ask walder frey to promise to take his life but not hurt his mother since the old man would probably just kill her before his eyes out of spite like ned he understood it was the end and accepted it no pleading no crying not vain attempts to save his life he just said goodbye to his mother and died looking at heri loved iti get that it made it much more sad at the same time i feel like he just gave up without caring for his mothers well being its like his idiot where is winterfell wife is dead so he just stands there waiting to be killed and didnt seem to care for what would happen to his mother dont get me wrong i basicallyliked how the rw turned out it was very heartbreaking but to think he cared more for his already dead wife than his mother who was still alive that bothers me"

"Winter In My Heart",2013-06-06,"they were already dead anyway i dont see why everyone likes that they just acted like fish in a barrel except for cat who pleaded but that isnt exactly my gripe anyway my thing is in the books its clear he genuinely feels bad for breaking his word whereas in the show its made explicitly clear he doesnt care at all i guess then if he spoke to frey or even during the apology scene that could have been remedied if you believe he truly meant it when he apologized then i guess it comes down differences in view because i only saw him saying it because he had to but okay they acted like a caged animal about to be shot poor grey wind so its a good thing they didnt really try to do a thing even if it was just try to somehow talk their way out of it okay glad thats cleared up maybe its just the frustration that they didnt show any fighting back like having bannermen there trying to protect the starks i dont know but it could have slightly been made up imo by having robb do something anything more than stand there since i got the impression he was more wounded in the books compared to the show"

"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-06-07,"well there are decent moral beings in the series i think just because shes not horrible like most other characters go doesnt mean shes much more than a pretty faceits not because shes just not horrible how many other nobleborn characters do we see who deliberately give up their wealth and privilege to serve the less fortunate without any expectation of fame or glory and without being on the run from some worse fate like her or not and i personally found her annoying and not all that attractive her story is very unusual and as i said hits robb right in his idealistic sweetspot edited by former lord of winterfell 07 june 2013  1221 pm"

"Winter In My Heart",2013-06-07,"yes robbs marriage to jeyne was definitely a shotgun wedding so if you want to see the marriage on the show as a shotgun wedding then it actually reflects somewhat the story in the books although personally i think that on the show he did it because he was in love and wanted her to be his wife not because he claimed he could have been lying  and i think he likely was he felt an obligation like in the bookit still felt like a rushed wedding to me in the show and we dont know exactly what happened in the books to say for certain it was rushed with jeyne and im sure he loved jeyne and also felt an obligationhonor to her i dont like they cut the honor part out of the show it could have been love and honor but no they butchered the honor part"

"Wunhopkuendo",2013-06-07,"so youre not a fan of the books and only the hbo show satisfies you is that right since you think jeynes subplot is silly you probably wasnt impressed with the red wedding in the novels if a plot starts with something that silly its hard to buy it i guess if i thought robb falling for jeyne silly i certainly wouldve be taken out of the story thats built around that particular development so we can conclude that when reading you were probably relived when rw came because you didnt have to suffer through that storyline anymore good for youill even go further and take your post as a personal compliment on my account i mean heres grrm struggling to make you care for robb and his love interest wasting hundreds of pages in the task and still failing completely he didnt fool you for a second it seems on the other hand i managed to provoke your emotional response with no more than few posts wow thanksyeah you didnt put any words in my mouth there of course i was fooled at the rw and threw my book against the wall like everyone else did it was the afterward of the events where it came about as a silly plot line in the book it comes together a little better than it would have for television though in the show it looks like tywin puts together a brilliant betrayal since he cant beat robb on the field of battle hence the change of lannisters send their regards changing it to look like he is omniscient enough to know that robb will fall hook line and sinker for his convoluted plot is really contrived but thats just my opinion far from an emotional response directed at you over such wittiness in your no more than a few posts"

"Winter In My Heart",2013-06-07,"actually i saw you post only after i posted mine since english isnt my first language i usually type my posts in some spellchecking program and copy them later in fact one of the aspects of robbs tragedy is that he always tried to apply neds logic while he wasnt neds copy to begin with i dont find him a hypocrite who hides behind his fathers honor god forbid but from the very beginning of the war he was always trying to follow the steps of his father even while ned was still alive and at the same time he feared hes not up to the task as evidenced in that touching little scene in the first book when he wants to comfort bran but ends up in tears himself the rapidity of the events that fell on his shoulders crushed him to the point that he was constantly seeking for someone he can rely on thats why he turned to theon which was also understandable at that point since it wasnt theon that robb misjudged it was balon and later to jeynei agree i kind of think things might have gone a little differently if he hadnt sent cat to go try and talk to renly if she would have been with him the whole time jeyne wouldnt have been needed at all as someone to take care of him when he was wounded thats a little off point though i basically saw things like that where he was trying so hard to act the part of a man grown and do what ned would do but it was just to much and that the position he was in got thrust onto him so far and that he wasnt prepared enough the fact he knew little of war in the beginning didnt help matters to much even though he won every battle it didnt help that he couldnt exactly trust all of his men bolton so just as green as he was in battle in the beginning he also was in politics which even ned was as far as the latter goes but yeah like i said i definitely dont think he was ned 20 but i do think he tried his best to act how he thought his father would in the situations he found himself in its just a shame he hadnt been around girls more even in the show it didnt sound like he had been or else that might have tremendously helped to resist taking comfort in a pretty girl who was tending to him maybe he was sheltered a bit by ned and cat im thinking"
"Winter In My Heart",2013-06-07,"ultimately the marriage not much of a problem for me really its not completely impossible just very unlikely the way i see the characters robb just seems too dutiful for this even at 16well he did have to grow up rather fast he might have been to dutiful but i just see it as him trying to take after his father as well as his mother theyre both about honor after all and by taking a noble womans innocence he probably felt like it was his duty to remedy that i agree i think he loved her and that it was in part used as an excuse but i dont think that its any less true just because he also happened to love herwhich is partly why i dont see the problem with jeyne if they had changed things a bit and made her not an enemy bannermens daughter among other things to help make it work on screen because so many people think part of his reason was to marry out of love so they could have easily played that up as well as showing that he thought he needed to marry her to preserve her honor i dont mind they wanted romance in the show but i do think that they could have kept the character but tweaked things enough to make people be able to relate to it better than they could in the books thats why i hate the fact they cut out the honorable part and used only love in the show since it does take away some from robbs characterplus the fact is remember how angry he got when jeyne came running out and wanted to go to the wedding with him and then look at how robb was in season one thats another reason i find it unrealistic he suddenly fell for talisa all because she was spunkyidealisticand bold enough to question a king even someone as young as robb i cant see would liking the fact someones berating him as noble as he is thats no justification for anyone to say he would actually like being challenged against his authority especially when he already has all these bannermen that hes trying to keep in line and show he can be a leader despite his young age in comparison to them why on earth would he want to hearknow another person doubting and degrading him edited by winter in my heart 07 june 2013  0605 pm"

"rmholt",2013-06-07,"yes robbs marriage to jeyne was definitely a shotgun wedding so if you want to see the marriage on the show as a shotgun wedding then it actually reflects somewhat the story in the books although personally i think that on the show he did it because he was in love and wanted her to be his wife not because he claimed he could have been lying  and i think he likely was he felt an obligation like in the bookit reminds me of one of the more packed statements in the book about characters tywin said jeyne was her mothers daughter and robb was his fathers son with the benefit of hindsight jeyne trusted her mother who in no way was going to allow the westerlings to go against the lannisters now i think jeyne loved robb so if she was her mothers daughter it wasnt because she was like her mother but because tywin controlling her mother controlled jeyne i think its a bit different for robb robb is controlled by his father in a more subtle way  by example and from the grave as a larger than life hero so he could be controlled by knowledge of his fathers sense of honor etc no way a smarter guy would have set foot in the twins like ned robb expected more honor from others than was smart"

"thepooperthatwaspromised",2013-06-07,"i was not going to weigh in on the whole talisa issue because the argument seems to have devolved into an argument of preference vs substancebut i do need to point out that the sheer number of people both sullied and un who just dont buy rts love story is pretty clear evidence of an unsuccessful storyline regardless of whether you liked talisa or even jeyne for that matter not enough people bought into it which makes it an inarguable failure maybe the pooch was already screwedmaybe jeyne really was just a plot a device and the opportunity to make a more compelling love interest for robb just couldnt be supported by the time and story constraints already in place but inherently good writing makes you buy into it and in a series both tv and book that provides so many relationships that fans would pay to see when that doesnt happen for the majority of the fanshipwho can legitimately argue that its not a failureand while i dont feel the vitriol that so many do for talisa and i did cry salty crocodile tears when she named the baby and when she died most of the great love stories in asoiaf and got are earned over time danydrogo jaimebrienne catned etc mostly we are urged by the series to suspect the love at first or even second sight rts romance was as close as you can come to that without venturing into naive beautiful sansa territorybut my original posting reason isnt even about talisa its about catls deepest apologies if someone already covered this but regarding whether or not michelle fairley will be backfrom buzzfeedso catelyn is dead but in the books she is not actually gone she becomes lady stoneheart who has deep gashes in her face from scratching herself can<U+0080><U+0099>t speak because her throat was cut so deeply and was in the river for a few days before being brought back to life she marauds around killing freys plus anyone who might have done the starks wrong and appears occasionally going forward have you talked to dan and david about season 4mf well you<U+0080><U+0099>ll just have to keep watching you<U+0080><U+0099>ll have to keep wattttttcccchhhhin<U+0080><U+0099>the way lady stoneheart zombie catelyn is described <U+0080><U+0094> she<U+0080><U+0099>s completely insane basicallymf i<U+0080><U+0099>m completely insane so it mightn<U+0080><U+0099>t be too much of an acting stretchwere that to happen in the show<U+0080><U+0099>s future would that be funmf no one knows no one knows sorry kateoh my god <U+0080><U+0094> i<U+0080><U+0099>m asking in theory you mentioned before that at the end catelyn is purely consumed by vengeance and that seems to be the afterdeath version of her which seems to be great foddermf of course for an actor to play something like that i think visually it would be incredible how do you portray evil vengeance lust for revenge what does that do physically to a human being what do they end up looking like how do they attain it the embodiment of that is something that would be incredibly exciting even evil people are justified if you<U+0080><U+0099>re playing a character like that you have to find a way of liking them"

"Miodrag",2013-06-07,"just to add not only that robb lost the will to fight a war against iron throne he also seemed to me as he was ready to give up on everything except producing an heir to his family after executing karstark he was all like why would anyone want to be a king at all and by writing his will down he showed his possible death was on his mind which is why i believe he gave up on everything other than producing the heir to winterfell and someone who can carry the stark name id even say that he wanted jeyne to be pregnant from that first intercourse they had and he certainly didnt want that child to be a bastard"
"StoneToilet",2013-06-07,"with this i completely agree it doesnt mean robb got what he deserved of course nor am i implying you implied that just that i dont buy robb was his fathers son explanation robb was noble and brave and a good leader in his own right but he was really not ned 20couple points 1 robb kinda got what he deserved he could have just fought a good old fashioned warfor the redress of grievances which wouldnt have required total victory just being enough of a pain in the ass to get some concessions instead he crowned himself and refused to even consider bending the knee ned would gladly have sacrificed his honor as well as any personal ambitions to avert a bloodbath doesnt mean i wasnt rooting for him but he should have been seeking an exit plan before the westerlings even came into it think about roose boltons comment about boy lords being the bane of any house 2 i thought robb not being his fathers son was a theme so many references to his auburn hair and tully features and his soft heart not that he didnt have plenty of his father in him or that ned didnt have a heart but where ned was icy and reserved robb was warm and gregarious in the context of the larger story i took it as a significant theme that robb was less starkish than jon 3 i to this day do not understand tywins comment about robb being his fathers son and jeyne being her mothers daughter for jeyne did he just mean a temptress because her fathers marriage was unwise in a sociopolitical sense but ned everyone believes that he fathered a bastard some believe it was on the highborn ashara dayne who was definitely of a high enough social rank to marry either way as far as anyone knows though obviously most of us believe otherwise he dishonored a woman and chose not to break a crucial alliance for her sake so wtf was tywin talking about 4 and this is off topic but can we get some angst and vitriol directed at catelyn she really ruined everything she encouraged ned to go to kl when he wanted to refuse robert in the book not the show much to my bafflement she told him to trust lf leading directly to his downfall she trusted lf herself naively leading her to arrest tyrion impulsively which started the war in the first place and if she hadnt released jaime and alienated the karstarks robb might have been able to weather the storm he caused when he married jeyne and if she had been willing to just go home and let her son handle his business she might have been able to prevent ser rodrick from leaving winterfell essentially undefended though admittedly thats a weaker point since robb wanted her to go treat with renly but still not only were most of her chapters excruciating to read but she was the classic hovering meddlesome mother and she pretty much fucked everything up"
"StoneToilet",2013-06-07,"yes afterward of course you cant tell during the events because you dont get the information until after and for the hole notion of robbs infatuation not sure if this was an intentional pun or not that isnt the contrived part it is all the information we get after the fact that feels contrived the rw scene works in the books because you get so little information you really only get cats pov in regards to robb after the fact is when you get all the pieces and it starts to feel a bit contrived on screen it would be doubly soanyway in my own personal anecdotal experience the book purists are people who have come to the books relatively recently i read the first book when it came out back before many on here even knew how to read if you are one of those like me that waited patiently for years upon years between books and are still a book purist more power to you the grrm is a god fascination wore off for me long ago im just elated that i get to see one of my favorite stores shown on screen so much so that i am willing to overlook character and plot changes that often work for the better lets not forget that grrm has worked and continues to work on this show if you have ever written anything in your life not you specifically then you know that often times you wish for a doover grrm in many ways is getting thatinteresting your comment about waiting years and the grrm is god effect wearing off because i often wonder if anyone who was into the series early on still is i mean 17 years later and you still dont know who jons mother is you only just found out who killed jon arryn none of the starks have been reunites not even arya and nymeria at least mot physically even though it looked sure to happen when she was wandering the riverlads and the walkers havent even invaded yet you havent gotten any of that but you have gotten a myriad of filler content the dunk and egg books the map book and a tv show so grrm could max out his revenues id say that id be pissed but in reality id have long since moved onnow i think the key point regarding jeyne is that robb dis something impulsive out of grief just like his mother his tragic flaw was his softness but the significance i think is his greater association was cat than with ned not that ive really fleshed out what it means but it seems clear that it means somethinggotta love my sloppy typing edited by stonetoilet 07 june 2013  0918 pm"

"Teardrops",2013-06-08,"i can agree i dont think ned would have cheated no matter what was happening and what grieving news he got but i think if he wasnt married and in robbs position i think he would have married jeyneor maybe it was just the fact that robb was raised up by his honorable father that made him realize he had to fix the horrible situation once he took her innocence either way it was derived from the fact he has stark morals it doesnt matter if ned would have had sex with her but i think he would have tried to fix the situation as best he could in that situation like robb had attempted to doi disagree it wasnt something ned would have done married or not he would never never put a girl who chose to sleep with him above the men who are fighting for him and a preexisting and definitely more important oath when he could fix everything in other ways and robb knew thisrobb knew that marrying jeyne wouldnt just hurt his honor but also his kingdom and the norths cause and therefore it wasnt the right or most honorable thing to do  but  i took her castle and she took my heart robb smiledhonor was just a convenent excuse he chose to use and to believe in personally i prefer to see a good and honest young man with his judgment clouded by his feelings understimate the consequences of his actions and admits that he is doing what hes doing for love instead to see him do the same but hide behind an excuse that doesnt make senselook at how robb was in season one thats another reason i find it unrealistic he suddenly fell for talisa all because she was spunkyidealisticand bold enough to question a king even someone as young as robb i cant see would liking the fact someones berating him as noble as he is thats no justification for anyone to say he would actually like being challenged against his authority especially when he already has all these bannermen that hes trying to keep in line and show he can be a leader despite his young age in comparison to them why on earth would he want to hearknow another person doubting and degrading himbecause robb isnt a tyrant and ned teached him to listen to what people  even commoners  have to say the fact that in the past he reacted doesnt mean that he doesnt accept to be questioned but that he knows when to impose himself and a girl who dares to speak her mind isnt a treat he cant toleratetalisa offered robb a chance to get an external outlook on the situation something he needed in that moment since no matter how much confidence he showed before his bannermen he was struggling with what being a king really meant and the purpose of that war she asked him the right questions and with her objections made him face his own doubts and this among other things intrigued him edited by teardrops 08 june 2013  1025 am"

"Winter In My Heart",2013-06-09,"again why is it odd if a person has different characters traits if you dont find believable her other traits doesnt mean that she is a flip flop character but that her character doesnt work for you oonas acting didnt succeded in making you believe her just keep in mind that personal opinion  factwhat you are saying its not what talisa said she didnt say killing your enemy is wrong but the war is wrong innocent people who had nothing to do with joffreys crime or in the lannisters eyes robbs treason are risking their lives and dying horrible deaths and this is unjust she didnt see lannisters or starks but boys and men people its called humanity not stupidityi was merely using that as one example that she said you know how she mentioned that the men were boys who had never fought before tywin put swords in their hands the fact is what does she honestly expect to happen from telling him this obviously she is stupid if she thinks and from her talk it seems she thinks this that robb can just give up the war and go bend the knee oh yes he could so do that if he was looking to be suicidal and have his head chopped off like his father also what else is he supposed to do make a stupid move and march straight to kings landing obviously he has to get through all these people if he wants revenge on joffrey it makes her look narrow minded in saying how its wrong and sure she has a point that thousands of people dying is wrong but there isnt anything that can be done about it and in all honesty shes waisting her breath because he already knows the costs of war and also theres nothing he can do about it unless he was going to bend the knee which again would only be stupid and signing himself a death sentence so really the only insight she gave him was his lack of plan after winning the warokay by your logic shes bi polar one minute shooting off her mouth and the next making google eyes but that matters very little in hindsight when theres other things that make her unrealisticthe fact is oona has terrible acting and that terrible acting didnt help this character at all if you look at her purely objectively you can tell she has very little range in her acting abilities if you re watch the scenes and look closely oona pretty much gives a blank look in almost every scene its like her default facial expression or something when you compare her to the others in the show alfie charles lena peter etc you can see shes one of the weakest there just compare her almost always using a blank look to michelles purposeful one at the rw then it becomes quite clear she just isnt very goodif you take into account the lack of good acting and then lack of chemistry robb and cat had more chemistry season one than him and his wife plus look at dany and drogo who had made a romance work in a short time its really a no brainer that this romance didnt work very well adding those two things on top of the fact the writers really did give her some stupid lines then this was just a fail waiting to happeni havent talked to one person off of this site that actually likes talisa as a character the only people ive seen who like her are a small handful that defend her on here and i can count them on probably just one hand it comes off that the people who like her are in the minority and before you say its just book readers i know a girl who only read the first book and i have family that watch it plus ive read other people on here say how their unsullied friends didnt like the robbtalisa romance etc so if you look at it in terms of there seemingly being a lot more people who dislike her than like her how can you say objectively the writers didnt fail with this romance im quite sure they wanted this to be a true love people want to get behind but how can people do that if they hate the character and dislike the romance between the two and how theres people who feel its contrieved so just in terms of everything overall the writers really didnt accomplish what they were trying to edited by winter in my heart 09 june 2013  1148 am"

"Miodrag",2013-06-09,"exbruinsfan teardrops tywins bastard youve been rather busy for the last few hours and i just came back home so ill read the rest of your posts little later on but for now ill just answer few earliest and explain why i find talisas line that i quote to be an utter disaster its wrong on so many ways but ill do my best to go through all of them winter in my heart if i repeat some of the things you already wrote in the discussion its not on purpose but it also not a miracle since were obviously in total agreement over talisa first youre fighting to overthrow the king and yet you have no plan for what comes after implies that she doesnt know that the north declared independence and that what comes after is really of no concern for robb nor anyone of his soldiers which is funny because shes treating the wounded of that army so its a stretch to assume that shes so uninterested in their war goals that she manages to have absolutely no knowledge of them a person that is familiar with the norths recently proclaimed independence wouldnt have to ask whats robb going to do with the iron throne once he kills joffrey second she does have interest after all because shes asking in a way that implies shes trying to mock robb for his lack of strategic vision which is either hypocrisy if shes interested in his war goals only for the sake of argument or terrible inconsistency in writing if she suddenly became genuinely interested third how can she expect an answer to that question at all why the hell would any battle commander  let alone a king  explain his ultimate war goals to a girl he just met and who just a moment ago proudly distanced herself from his army asking that question in that circumstances means that shes either stupid to the bone or that she somehow sensed that robbs stupid enough to give her an honest answer if later its yet another inconsistency in writing because from the previous two remarks its clear that were not dealing with a woman of some high intelligence fourth and the biggest one is that the whole conversation is terribly contrived so she can end up appearing smart and in order to accomplish that writers managed to portrait robb as a damned fool whos a discussing his war goals with a chick he just met and who shows no loyalty to his cause whatsoever and b  hes even unable to articulate his war goals though they are of the most simple kind all he had to say to that stupid question  if he wanted to answer it at all which is once again utter nonsense  is i couldnt care less for the iron throne but no he was so impressed with her pacifistic spirit that he totally forgot about the brains he inherited from ned and cat both of considerable iq honestly the only person i can imagine asking that kind of question to a king on the battlefield just after the encounter with an enemy would be a psychologist conducting a survey among kings you know a scientific research of the mental conditions of nations leaders under stressful circumstances on their job which is a tough one in wartime anonymity guaranteed and all that id might buy a nurse questioning a king she just met  not in a lifetime"

"numenorian",2013-06-10,"having been through the chapters revolving around the sack of winterfell i cant seem to understand how robb wasnt informed about the attack of ramsays forces considering he was flashing his banners and all sure sir rodrik cerwyn and company were ambushed but the rest of the two thousand men that survived and were allies of robb had to inform him of the bolton attack but we learn in the catelyn chapters that robb listens to just to what roose tells him about ramsay rescuing the survivors not to forget that ramsay saved the two freys is it possible that ramsay worked under rooses command has anyone figured it out that could enlighten me"

"Gregor's Nancy Boy",2013-07-02,"i am all for criticism the rw was the most powerful moment i have ever read but you just sounded like the most uptight cynical closedminded arrogant  outright most irritating person i have ever had to read a comment from damn man stop nitpicking every single aspect of the show the wind was supposed to be blowing west her hair was supposed to be curly not straight the wedding song was in a higher key than i thought it would be this isnt the booksevery single aspect maybe you need to read my post again that and catelyns last chapter from asos there are a plethora of aspects missing from the books that i neglected to mention because i deemed them unnecessary this is the first and only episode ive had a serious problem with its obvious you cant control your anger because someone criticized your favorite tv show this isnt the books is the most ignorant argument someone can use when defending a mediocre adaption this show set out to adapt the books as closely as possible and was doing a marvelous job up until the second season the reason i was upset was because the rains of castamere couldshould have been so much better if the show was crap in general i wouldnt have caredi appreciate some of the complaints the lack of bannermen mainly and the lack of grey wind actionso what youre saying is what you think matters matters and what i think matters doesnt1 i agree i wouldve liked to see greywind attack freys at the beginning but that wouldve made it way too obvious something was going to happen they did show gw howling in despair laterthere were no foreboding details omens or ominous undertones in this episode at all greywind attacking a random frey in the tv show is not any more implicative of robbs fate than greywind attacking a random frey in the books it causes an apprehensive tension which was supposed to be present3 the big connection was between robb  catelyn yeah i said as much too bad the writers made it all about robb  talisathe warging capability between robb  greywind was never really addressed so it wouldve been pretty random to see robb all of a sudden warging out of his body into gwrandom he was a stark child with a direwolf showing robb rolling his eyes back would have been enough we dont need to see him changing skins we just saw orell do that same thing just a few scenes ago so im sure the unsullied would catch onepisode 9 is robb warging hes a warg like bran is jon snow a warg wheres grey wind is he going to surviveepisode 10 wow they killed grey wind anyway robb died twice thats messed upwhat the hell is so wrong with that reaction it doesnt take away from robb  catelyn at all those quick little thoughts provoked from that tiny little detail would soon be overwhelmed by the death of catand btw saying that gws death was something barely cared for yeah you are heartless who feels for a creature trying to break free  save his master getting shot multiple times defenselessly with arya to sit there  witness itbecause the dog wasnt desperate at all they should have made grey wind cgi in that last scene and had him pacing around in circles digging at the floor clawing at the door howling relentlessly instead they put a dog in a kennel and bribed it with a treat from the outside which was incredibly obvious looking at the body language of the animal i felt bad for grey wind when i read grr martins book why would i feel bad again watching a far inferior version im sorry but werent you aware from my original post that i was too busy being pissed off over all the aforementioned alterations5 robb showed no confusion or despair the entire time he was speechless lost in the chaos yeah i know he wasnt frantic but he was completely dead inside  in shockso when an actor shows no emotion you chalk it up to being dead inside im going by richard maddens consistently mediocre portrayal of robb what are you going by why the hell else do you think he slowly rose and barely movedbecause he was shot by a crossbowas for catelyns death she doesnt say anything about the hair she thinks it can you please try to comprehend the difference between a book where thoughts are seen textually and a tv show where that does not happenyou dont say mr holmes can you please comprehend the fact catelyns thoughts are what made the red wedding as disturbing as it was and accept that the tv show has already made various thoughts into worded linesthis isnt the booksalso try not being a hypocritethe reason why so many nonbook readers were so moved is because it was a moving episodesome were moved because characters theyve grown attached to just died thats it this was the red wedding in its most basic form others thought it was a halfassed way to kill off important people and the way dd presented it it was georges version is much more complex and emotionally invoking if they had done it better which was entirely possible it could have been the greatest episode of the entire series arguably the best show on televisionthey arent all uptight and stuck up with only one thought on what the episode would be like bitching about any little thing different and here you are bitching about what another person didnt like youre the one whos coming off as uptight and stuck upthis episode was phenomenalare you sure you didnt mean to say in my biased fanboy opinion i thought this episode was phenomenal i read the books multiple times and i have the ability to watch something on screen and comprehend it is a different entity than the source material it came from and i dont ok blackwater is one of my favorite episodes so far if not my all time favorite that episode was done tastefully with appropriate alterations this one was a screw upi appreciated the similarities loved the entirety of the episode and respected the changes as this is an adaptationthe goal of this adaption was to adapt the source as closely as possible benioff  weiss as well as grr martin stated as much many times season one succeeded at this season two  three less so the rains of castamere was just an awful excuse for a game of thrones episode if grrm was presented the script for this episode and this episode alone before agreeing to dds offer he would have slammed his door in their facesstop being so cynical and start treating this like a series that is for all intents and purposes a gift stop going into an episode expecting a b c d then e to happen  just let the episode happen as it is people like you are the reason this show could fail you are so difficult to be pleased and refuse to just enjoy the damn show you have to bash every little thing that is different to you it is a gift youre right game of thrones is possibly my favorite tv series of all time but im not going to overlook all its flaws because of how great it is on its good days like i said this is the only time the show has utterly disappointed me and im utterly disappointed because this is my favorite show based on my favorite bookspretend you never read the books i bet you wont be so criticallol if you only knew thats how i go into every last episodesorry if that came off rude but dear god i am so sick of seeing overwhelmingly insulting comments that are so clearly exaggerated sure there were disappointments but to use horrible and other phrases implying this was the worst episode of the series is flat out ridiculous i dont know what showsepisodes you have been watching but you are out of your mindso you apologize then proceed to disrespect me again this episode was total crap and im sticking by that statement be sick of it all you want it doesnt mean youre rightthe simple fact that you said gw being killed meant nothing to you just shows how up in the clouds on your throne ruling book westeros you are i dont care how it happened in the books seeing gw trying to break free right after seeing robb is at his final moments all while arya is so close to reuniting with her family  almost close enough to get to gw thats compelling and absolutely painfulfun fact robb arya and grey wind showed absolutely no emotion during the red weddingblock out asoiaf and step into the world of game of thrones both are amazing but they are two separate things the show will never be the books its physically impossible but theyve done a damn good job of an adaptationconcerning a decent number of episodes i would completely agree with you but the fact youre saying everything about this show is golden all the time really indicates how deep in the closet you really are you dont need to tell me how to enjoy game of thrones it comes naturally to me i recommend you learn how to tolerate other peoples opinions without shitting all over them like youre superior or something then you need to learn how to discern crap from gold asoiaf puns smilepng classbbcemoticon alt editthis episode  the entire episodethis episode  the red wedding specifically edited by gregors nancy boy 02

"Rhogantis",2013-06-05,"yeah i hope most of the army stayed back but with robb being their with his queen you can imagine his best soldiers being there who will take charge of the northern army which now has less chance of defeating the lannisters after lord frey was rude after the apoligy was given i thought robb would have sensed something wasnt it said lord frey once did not show up to a battle until after it was finished so therefore you would not walk easily into his company without keeping your wits about you"

"Rhogantis",2013-06-06,"i understand now the whole of the starknorthern army was not actually at the rw so that would leave an army still defending the land in the name of the late robb regardless of the ruler dead there would be a rally round and a fight still on how it will play out i am unsure technically the nights watch is done for if not maybe for his heroism jon may be released from said vow and return to his rightfull place jon would make a great leader with allies in the nights watch tyrion hating his father and tyrion holding respect from those he led into battle at blackwater i do not see tyrion wanting to wipe the north out even jaime has had a somewhat change on perspective i have no clue what will happen people forgetting stannis still has an army and is waiting to attack i hope i have a clearer picture in episode 10"

"Blackstar347",2013-06-08,"ok i just made an account here i am distraught unhappy amazed bewildered and i was just bawling my eyes out and i have to write this i wont be posting in the book spoilers thread because i havent read the books i had the week off this week so i was deciding what to do id been hearing that ign had given the latest game of thrones episode a 10 and some of my coworkers told me it was a good series a while back maybe it would be a bit like lord of the rings or other fantasy novels i was always up for a good character story so i began watching game of thrones at about 6 episodes a day starting on monday thanks to my coworkers lending me the dvds i zoomed past the first season and yet alas after the first day while reading some gaming forums i got the death of eddard stark spoiled for me i didnt know how he died but i cursed so much that such a major plot point was spoiled i kept watching the rest of season 1 hoping it wouldnt come to pass and unfortunately it never came to be fortunately there were other characters i liked namely catelyn and jon snow and daenerys that i could cling to but after the end of season 1 because of that death being spoiled i just considered the show a good one with nothing special to think about it i would continue to see how my favorite characters would change the second season was largely the same but here is where something clicked for me every storyline seemed to grow more interesting and while i still had my favorites even the other stories seemed to gain speed and interest while i didnt like tyrion at first he is actually one of the honest characters in the show and it did such a good job to make me continue to absolutely hate joffrey it did a good job all around to make me hate people that i should hate and like people that i should like while adding in even more characters like shae and ygritte that round out the cast spectacularly and then today i decided to watch all the way to the current episode knowing that there was something significant that was going to happen in it but happy that it would be a surprise as i hadnt been spoiled like with ned but can i just say before that that season 3 has been my favorite season even without this episode im not sure it is because of the quality of the season or that with each episode i grow more and more attached to the characters so much so that there isnt a transition where i say oh no why are we showing this boring character story when other things are happening anymore there isnt a dull story to tell anywhere because the characters have just gotten so ingrained and interesting for me to watch oh and i have to add that olenna tyrell has made me laugh more than any other character on this show or any other show in a while and shes a new favorite of mine but lets get on to this episode this episode even with the thought that the burning of the leeches could mean the death of robb i refused to believe it no way that robb would die so early that the war that defined almost the entire series up to this point could end just because melisandre worked her magic somehow but oh no that magic didnt kill him when i saw catelyns worried face at the doors closing my heart dropped this cant be happening the wedding was so cheery and lively everything seemed to be going well and robb could finally find his victory over the lannisters the family would be reunited and theyd all travel back to winterfell but no catelyn pulled up boltons clothes to reveal armor and my heart dropped suddenly robs child whether it was a boy or girl was lost forever the man i thought was to be the main protagonist up to this point was shot full of arrows and my favorite character catelyn was shot as well and on the ground i had tears in my eyes by the time the scene shifted to the killing of greywind and i realized that arya would never reunite with her family even though id been anticipating it all season and then the final scene please let one of them live please let them go id grown so attached to these two that i wanted to see them move on so much so very much a sliver of hope came as my catelyn stark my hero begged and pleaded with the murderer surely he had some mercy he couldnt be so cruel to kill both of them just because a wedding was thrown off he had to have a heart somewhere but no he enjoyed all of this and did not regret it in the least and suddenly the lannisters took their first and last victory over robb at this point i was bawling staring at catelyn who id loved since the beginning standing there broken and beaten and i probably couldnt even imagine a fraction of the pain youd have to endure in a situation like that she was dead with her silence after slitting that girls throat which seemed to last minutes i didnt even care about what happened next as she was already gone and i just looked at the screen with more tears than i have had since longer than i can remember so here i am i walked around for a couple minutes not believing it this was incredible yet i didnt know how to handle it so here i am because i found a forum for the show and i have written a mini essay because i needed to get my feelings about this episode and the series catelyn was my favorite character from start till now but the show eased me into liking the other characters almost as equally i will move on from this massacre because i am reeling to find out what happens next after i watch the last episode tomorrow i will probably go read the books as i need more and this episode secured my thinking in that i need more im not even sure i posted this in the right forum or even if this was appropriate to post as this is more of a blog at this point but im doing it anyway as my first post and i wont regret it rip

"lostinasia",2013-06-03,"so much to like in this one since im thoroughly confused about what constitutes a spoiler ill just put it all in tags and note if you havent read to the end of book 4  i think  theres at least one big spoiler below spoiler as beowulf777 says above the fact that bran took a big jump in the warging without dragging it out too long how can you pretend to sell pork if you eat it all or whatever she said being completely unable to identify whatever piece of the pig the hound was eating a detail after bran wargs the rest of the group are sitting somewhat away from him facing him  hes been cut off from what was once more of a circle the faint faint suggestion that maybe just maybe robb saw arya through grey wind at the end really doubtful and not a plot point but nice to think about the conflicted hope when arya found grey winds cage oh great shes going to let grey wind go and then  ah crap i know grey wind will die no matter what happens uh never mind as others have said edmure being more of a likeable doofus and the blackfish being thankfully toned down a bit talking about how he loves his nephew both characters end the episode quite a bit more appealing blackfish presumably not being dead robb and talisa both doing a brilliant job at their end not having to see grey wind shot that would have done me in brutal but not too visually disturbing much like ladys death two seasons back robbs army with grey wind at the lead yay house stark looking back in the fight oh nevermind the fact that i was actually shaking after the episode ended i knew it was coming and i knew itd be intense but trembling wow i tear up pretty easily but the trembling was a surprise plus the little queasy feeling in my gut around the forty minute mark huh i thought werent you looking forward to this why so serious the fact that i now think the way theyve handled talisa and the wedding is a good thing ive never disliked it but i was worried how it was going to go aryas fate not being much of a cliffhanger at least not in the what is she dead too vein the conclusion to her chapter from the book would have been cheesy on the tv show rickon where the heck did that come from why have they been hiding this guy the wildling military strategy in which surrounding a hut apparently means everyone run straight towards it and make no effort to surround it callback to jons remark last episode that they dont know how to fight together a nice job of moving brans rickons and jons stories all forward quite a bit  leaving house stark not utterly forlorn jon pushing ygritte out of the way so she didnt have the chance to fight on his side and therefore get killed i have no idea if that was in the book or not the different ways tormund and orell turned against jon the latter because hes just a shit the former with some regret but recognizing this guy he likes is unfortunately on the other side the switch from jinglebells or whatever his name was to freys latest wife an effective way to demonstrate where catelyns arc is heading not that it looks like her arc is heading much of anywhere the fighting threesome in yunkai will have to watch that again and would love to hear a critique from someone that actually knows their stuff on martial arts"

"Cyvasse Khal",2014-02-24,"to the people who have listened to the dvd commentary on season 3 episode 9 rains of castamere with richard maddern and michelle fairley was anyone else extremely moved by how emotional they both got after watching the red wedding scene michelle was weeping as she had not watched the episode and richard was also struggling to talk by the end of the episode i absolutely loved that they were affected by it because it showed that they truly cared about the show and like richard said became very attached to their characters  as fans of the book series all we really ask is that the actors bring the characters to life as true as they can and respect the character grrm and to a lesser extend dd has written for them and the story grrm has created i cant praise the casting choices and actors enough as its easy to see they are all very much into it and love it themselves so its very warming to see two of the main cast so upset over the ending to their characters and an end to their time on the show perhaps not michellewell see what they do with that"
"Cyvasse Khal",2014-02-26,"side note a little disappointed there was no peter dinklage liam cunningham or stark kids commentary for this season as i found those the most entertaining to listen to in the previous two seasons but i understand its hard to get them in and do it if they are working and have a tight schedule so im grateful for the actors writers and directors that do participate and have done in the past would love a conleth hill and peter dinklage commentary together next season"

"Cheshire Rat",2013-06-04,"my boss is the only non book reader i know that watches it and early this season he said i dont really like robb stark anymore he makes bad decisions and i was thinking well he wont be too upset then but boy was i wrong hes gone crazy the second i got in the car this morning he started yelling about the episode and how much he hated it when i said something about not liking robb stark he took the crazy up a notch and yelled i dont who cares about him why did they kill catelyn she was a good person she didnt deserve it the rant continued for 15 minutes he is especially irate that arya was so close to seeing her mother he kept saying arya is all i have left i mean he just kept yelling about catelyn for 15 minutes and anytime i tried to say i was really upset about her dying too he just cut me off and started in on the she didnt deserve to die thing after the 15 minute rant he said he couldnt talk about it yet which okay then at lunch he started up again and started going on about how they could have just taken catelyn and arya hostage and then they would be alive and together i made the mistake of saying that the freys were planning on taking catelyn hostage until she started with the throat slitting then he roared dont you dare blame her for this i just gave up at that point and nodded along apparently i cannot understand his grief he told me he wasnt watching the finale and i thought he was being one of those people who said they werent going to watch the show anymore but he said no he just needed an extra week to recover all in all it made me feel like my tears were a completely sane reaction"

"bobbybuilderton",2013-06-05,"ah i see well there were a few who were just being needlessly pessimistic but for some people it was based off of their friends and family saying they werent interested in what happened to robb and cat and didnt care what happens in that story i think they only didnt care because they took it for granted how that story would end you know the hero would suffer setbacks but come out on top eventually when something is shaping up to be like what youre used to its hard for it to stand next to unique things like jaime losing his hand political intrigue and backstabbing and still be engaging"
"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2013-06-05,"yeah but that shows sort of the fickle nature of us humans a lot of people proclaimed they didnt care but once they saw the end all of a sudden everything in hindsight was much more interesting i actually felt that way while reading jon snow he can be so brutally boring sometimes but come adwd i felt i needed a jon reread after i finished the book however i still think that the whole my friends hate robb they butchered it is terrible reasoning since everyone i know thats unsullied have either cat or robb as one of their favorites more so robb though its just anecdotal and we were never really going to know the extent of the general viewerships feelings toward the rw until it aired and i think we can quite comfortably say that they cared a lot"

"Shadow on the Wall",2013-06-06,"i think there is some validity to this point i dont think its a coincidence that killing off all those characters in asos plus the departures of other characters that end conflicts the audience had grown to enjoy was followed by what many think are the two weakest books in the series its like a fireworks show where you blast off everything in the first 30 seconds amazing to watch but not much reason to stick aroundi disagree firstly the rest of asos which will correspond roughly to season 4 will be excellent after that there is a lull but the direction in which the plot heads is excellent the main problem with books 4 and 5 is not the direction the plot takes  its the execution those books have so much filler and glacial plot progression instead of condensing long travelogues martin decides to tell them in full and his books suffer as a resultall in all the red wedding was a fantastic plot twist and works well in the context of the story season 4 will be excellent and seasons after that can be great too if they cut the weak material out and focus on the stronger elements"

"lyanna_maria",2013-06-07,"my friend goes on and on about how jon and ygritte should have fled to essos haha but when i asked a general prediction on the ending of the series he said jon will go to daenerys snd become his friend she will give him a dragon and together they will conquer westeros she will be in the iron throne and he will end up being the lord of all the north i think thats most how he would like it to be but still i like it haha edited by lyannamaria 08 june 2013  0918 am"

"Tirilei",2013-06-07,"well therein lies your problem if you read up on spoilers you are subverting the art of storytelling so clearly youre not going to feel the same emotional pull as others the whole point of the red wedding is that you believe robb will go on to be successful if he can just get through this period of things falling apart as its a story you expect him to make it the emotional side comes from the devastation of having your expectations shatteredi dont have much sympathy for people who purposefully look up spoilers and then criticise the storytelling if martin wanted people to find out that way he would have posted the plot summary for the entire series back in 1996then you dont pay attention to what is being criticized im not criticizing the art of story telling or the effectiveness of the story in shocking the viewer i criticize that this shock effect is this particular writers goal and where he takes his story he does it very successfully and effectively but i dont like the destination as you might call it so i tend to get off the train and walk along side as far as i may choose maybe thats about staying in control yes i think that has a lot to do with it if you dont like where something is going you refuse to give up control then you remain cauteous and refuse to allow the story to take control of your emotions besides not everyone gets as emotional about a tv series as some of the peoples friends here that are described as crying etc i can cry over tv programs too but am more likely to do so when i see someone overcoming suffering or showing selflessness and sacrifice in the face of adversity suffering animals make me cry right away thats unbearable but not some bloody massacre or fighting scenes"
"Tirilei",2013-06-07,"ps was trying to think of a scene in got that made this nonreader cry one that came to mind was where catlyn told talysa about her feelings towards jon when he was a sick child how she first prayed for his death then hated herself for it and prayed for his health a scene like that her admitting her emotional dilemma and weakness and then thinking of a child that wasnt loved by a mother and still grew up to be honest and kind i found that touching i also found theons reflection upon his mistakes touching though not as much the death of the wolf in the kennel was probably the most touching part of the massacre for me"

"Envie",2013-06-04,"i think im going to take sides with the camp that thinks their choice to show her silent and catatonic at the end was better than having her go crazy and rip her face to shreds as was described in the books while that was definitely dramatic in reading im not sure it would have played out as well on film as many have said michelles acting was so good you actually saw her go from shock to rage to dead inside long before her throat was cut at the point she slit the girls throat the light went out and the woman standing there appeared already dead slitting her throat was mercy at that point that was some amazingly powerful acting and needed nothing more added"

"Q the Cat",2013-06-04,"i thought the scene was perfect the moment that one of the freys shut the door and catelyn realized things were taking a turn was stomachchurning but the decision to begin the actual violence with the murder of talisa was utterly shocking and in fact that choice just hammered home the depths of the freys fury that they would begin a massacre by butchering a pregnant woman simply bc she carried a prince or princess that frey wanted for himself ugh i loved how they cut back and forth to what was happening outside allowing arya to observe things as they happened which is a nice way for her to understand her mother and brother are dead as opposed to her realizing it in a dream by the time sandor clegane conked her on the head i was thinking it was a mercybut ultimately the scene really belonged to madden and fairley i disagree that maddens acting was off i think it was perfect and it brought the whole scene full circle from the beginning of the ep when robb and cat are back on the same page and are a team again in fact thats what makes it all so tragic robb checks out much the same way his mother does when he loses everything which to him is his wife and child and his men only in opera does the hero rage against the dying of the light when hes lost everything and has a bunch of arrows stuck in his back and chest for a show like this to see the king of the north brought low crawling to his dead bloody wife and just giving up nothing is more appropriate and more powerful especially set against catelyns desperate pleading for him to get out he doesnt want to get out he wants to give up and his giving up informs catelyns own catatonia the two of them really are so much alike even at the moment of death and while it was horrible to watch i rather loved that they did it that way it was the perfect ending to their stories such as it is and to their relationship which was one of the best on the showi am also very relieved frankly that they didnt do the facial mutilation it would have come off as campy even with an actress as talented as fairley done as is we got to see the light literally leave cats huge wide eyes and become something else a beautiful foreshadowing of lady stonehearts expression the throat cutting done as afterthought was powerful tooshe was dead before the blade touched her throat and she looked almost relieved when it happenedthank you so much for writing this out you really captured my thoughts as wellmichelle and madden were stellar"

"Zman1863",2013-06-06,"i also approve of the change from the raving catelyn to the quiet version it conveys essentially the same thing without risking the perception that it was over the top i dont think the book version of catelyns final moments would have translated well to the show i dont really see it as a lack of ambition that they decided to tone down the outward aspects of catelyns breakdown but a tasteful creative choice its like how they kept tyrions nose or the shows blessed purge of fools in motley like jinglebell or patchface true it is a bit odd to call the choice tasteful in a scene where they had a pregnant woman stabbed in the belly but thats still my perception of it i think catelyns face clawing and outward insanity works in the book because it is presented in a way that focuses on what is going on inside catelyns head while those overt actions are occurring the reader is detached from the reality of what she is doing just as she is i dont think they would have pulled off this effect in the show they could have tried a few things to do it but i think that in the end a raving face clawing catelyn would have been seen as out of place over the top or going too far"

"silentwanderer",2013-06-06,"i thought it was perfect  that empty look on her face when she realises that shes lost everything and that probably all her children are dead argh it was way more effective than having her claw at her face and laugh hysterically i think that would have been too much to bear for the viewers that image of cat standing perfectly still with that empty look on her face while her throat is being cut  i cant get it out of my headi agree as a viewer it made me root for someone to put her out of her misery she was suffering so muchit gave me the closure the book didnt give to me because reading the same scene made me root for revenge instead edited by silentwanderer 06 june 2013  1150 am"

"victim",2013-06-04,"on the topic of how he killed robb again its the way it was directed roose ducking in stabbing robb and then ducking back out fit the whole tone of the slaughter it could have happened slowly where you get long drawn out shots of blades being unsheathed and robb preparing to die like when ned was beheaded in this instance though i think the quick shots and fast pacing helped move the shocks forward quickly and effectively it wasnt entirely unlike a character getting whacked on the sopranos where all you get is a bang and a body falling over"

"NomadicDirewolf",2013-06-04,"to be fair i thought roose was mixed this episode he was his normal awesome self played by michael mcelhatton brilliantly throughout the series and in this episode too the problems were mainly writing until the actual massacre itself i wouldnt be suprised if he just wanted to see the look on catelyns face before it happened he is ramsays dad after all and we get information in the books to say hes done some pretty crazy things sure caution usually takes priority but not much could go wrong at this point either way im happy even if it is a minor breach of character because we got to see that bit of the wedding which we get in the books with catelyn and that chain mail being the oh shit moment him running off just seemed a little pussy like at first but now i realise that that the whole getting in the way of the arrows is a pretty good practical reason the whole the lannisters send there regards i didnt like that much at all at first it seemed to quick and it wouldve been better if hed taken his time over it still it grew on me and it doesnt seem so bad and so quick as it was the first time after a couple more times watching however it still wasnt as epic as the books it was more done for shock valuethat seemed to be the story of the whole massacre it was awesome one of the best scenes in the show ever but still not as epic as the books and more done for shock value with everything happening quickly"
"The Fourth Head",2013-06-04,"on a more serious note is roose really a fighter i thought he was just a survivor isnt that why robb sent him to fight tywin didnt he spend that part of the war strategically retreating and doesnt he later hide in a wagon for fear of getting shot with a poison arrow by reeds people the fact that he scurried out of the room is not out of characterfurther catelyn needs someone to slap the hell out of at that point the need for her character to do that  to a character the tv audience knows  supercedes the need to make roose bolton look like a badass the audience will get to learn more about roose for a long time to come that was cats final moment and in my opinion roose is not some macho villain  just a sociopath  cunning cautious and therefore dangerous he has the same sadistic tendancies as his son but he tries so hard to control his sick desires leeches sucking away his passions so as not to loose his positionthats a fair point that i missed i guess the fact that roose bolton has more cruelty in his little finger than all the freys put together doesnt necessarily mean he is a brave man but what annoyed me about this adaptation is that it shattered the menacing aura that the show was starting to build up around him in future series the boltons are supposed to be feared not sneered at roose looked like a little bitchi understand the choices they made using roose as the big reveal guy was a neat touch and that subsequently he needed to be slapped for the purposes of serving cats character and needed to get out of the line of fire but honestly i think catelyn slapping someone like lame lothar the guy who came to broker the deal would have been a better choice and a better compromise in terms of preserving the roose characterit was a huge departure to have roose scuttling out of the room away from a woman after being bitchslapped instead of dramatically marching into the room at the head of a force of northernersit would have been delicious for cat to call out his name for her to look relieved then look doubtful for the audiences hopes that rob and cat could be saved to pivot on this grey man for people to dare hope a cruel element lost in this adaptation and for him to march up to robb and stab him with a force of boltons behind himanother thing im disappointed about is that they didnt reveal boys parentage immediately prior to the betrayal that would have added to the significance of the moment making this about more than mere survival for roose but about power edited by the fourth head 04 june 2013  0617 am"

"UnCleos",2013-06-05,"i thought his portrayal was quite good and thought the look was in character we know roose has a sadistic side and because of the lack of characters he was needed to fill the role of the chain mail reveal it wasnt exactly a wide smile either his eyes widened a little bit as if to say yup youre fucked as for the running again i didnt really see it as out of character roose is very intelligent and as many have pointed out the bolts were about to rain pardon the pun down on robb cat and the rest for me it was actually one of the most realistic scenes in the episode reminded me of a politician being led away on a stage after bullets are fired nice touch imo and a great way to kick off the chaos only thing i agree with is that his original line should have been kept the same his final stabbing of robb could have been done better in many ways but i think they struggled with the logistics of roose stabbing robb point blank we saw the complications that this show had when arya stabbed the stable boy with needle maybe the clumsiest scene in the series i think they needed it to be quick hell you dont even see what roose had in his hands"

"Prince of Dragonstone",2013-06-05,"the silent exchange between cat and roose was one of the best moments in the entire series to me i loved it because it goes straight to the core of both their characters catelyn the fierce protective and suspicious mother finds out something is terribly amiss before anyone else roose the master of trollery taunts his liege lady in such a dastardly way hes basically telling her what is about to transpire and that there is absolutely nothing she could do about it at this point it was chilling and so perfect for building up that whole scene"

"Thor Odinson",2013-06-05,"well to be fair the actor playing tommen is a little kid who likely doesnt get a lot of work thats a far cry from someone like natalia tena who if they dont keep her on may very well find herself in a new job thatll keep her from coming back so imo theyre going to have to have some kind of osharickon plot thread going in order to keep her on which imo would be a good thing like other posters id like to see more of the north and damn it osha is pretty awesome and id love to see more of her"
"HouseHarrison",2013-06-05,"i doubt it theres already the issue of too many plots and the producers have been given a huge opportunity now that the robbcat stuff is gone which will help allow the episodes to seem less slow paced"
"go joff go",2013-06-05," i dont know if the too many plots things is going to be as big a deal next year i feel like next year will be on of the easiest to film since season one since more of the characters are static jon stays at the wall merge of sam and jon dany stays in mereen half the cast stay at kl merge of jaimie and kl plots and the kingsmoot new plot only mobile plots shouls be arya basically continuation of brotherhood plot stannis single plot as opposed to the three plots of stannis meldavos that we got this year bran possible split of bran and rickon plots and theon possible merge with bran or rickon plot robb plot is gone i feel like that will be much easier to manage"
"boojam",2013-06-05,"i may be misremembering but did grrm not say that he has liked osha so much in the show that he plans to write more for her in the booksgeorge said it more than once he was blown away by natalia tena  who  even in real life seems more of a wilding than the wildlings he wants to keep her as a characteri have a feeling this is one of the things dave dan and bryan discussed with grrm in santa fegeorge  says or it is said that is somewhat along on novel six whatever the hell that meansso  my guess is that we will indeed see natalia next season and finally get the story as to why they went to skagos which so far george has not explained in the storyit may be that they ran into the dangers of all the mayhem south of them and didnt she say she came around the wall by sea at eastwatch she then would have known about skagosi cant see this being an adventure that will be dwelled upon  but grrm left it off page for so long now maybe rickons story needs telling"
"silentwanderer",2013-06-05,"i think we might see more of rickon and osha than we expected i dont think they will reach umbers thoughthey will have some adventures and i am pretty sure it will be on screeni agree they will probably skip ahead or create a whole new adventure just for them"
"Master Forel's Fro",2013-06-06,"to be honest i really hope the show doesnt care about that theyll be entering major bookspoiler territory in season 5 for sure and quite probably in season 4 if it best serves the purposes of the tv show then show it if the tv show wants to keep it a secret then great but i can easily see them adding a storyline a rickon chase does make sense as something for ramsey amp reek to do but im also wondering how much they can speed up events in the north  and for that matter almost everywhere elsei agree they can show the journey and being hunted down without revealing anything they already said where they were headed so its no spoiler plus if they want to send them elsewhere skagos viewers havent heard about it and they need to show why the northerners dont know where rickon is and why he didnt make it to last hearth was because he was being hunted by roose boltons crazy son if the northerner have rickon save then stannis wont be offering jon winterfell since there is no will they need to include that for jons arc and too much else depends on ppl thinking thinking sansa is the heir ramsay is a very good hunter at least in the books  where hes releasing his prisoners or letting them escape and then hunting them down dont you think if he would start hunting osha and rickon he would capture themalso the dreadfort is quite far away from oshas nad rickon position and he would have to be far away from his home to hunt them down  how would he know where they even are nobody knows where they arei think ramsay could be overestimating his hunting abilities he caught theon cause he told him where to go in the show and even in the books its not hard to find fresh tracks of barefoot naked prisoners especially when the dogs have their cent"
"King Tam Stark",2013-06-06,"its a nice thought but both the book and tv show are supposed to be stopping it getting any bigger and cutting material and plots making up a whole new chapter of osha and rickons adventures would require allowing it to grow some more and take up valuable budget and screen time"

"Greywolf2375",2013-06-05,"same also her being brought to the wedding made absolutely no sense since it was insulting to the freyseither way it was insulting to the freys  if she shows up she is then showing up the family if she doesnt show up as in the books the freys can be insulted for not being able to see the young lady that robb threw over a frey foreither way the freys get what they want  another insultim not really a talisa fan but jeyne was not such a great character either wouldnt the audience have thought robbs marrying a lannister bannermans daughter was a little fishy toonot if it got introduced similar to the book  since they were not a hugely powerful house switching that alliance may have made sense in that situation if they had played it differently that might have raised more alarms"
"'96Buck",2013-06-05,"imo the point of changing to talisa was primarily so that she could go to the wedding and get hideously murdered that and slimming down to get rid of the ultimately extraneous westerling plot tywin doesnt get quite as many devious plan points but so what show watchers have granted him devious status at this point and extra points would be wasted the scene is more impactful this way especially after the wise elimination of the cat and dying father  riverrun arc it doesnt work for the freys to murder jeyne since the westerlings were in on the red wedding without the westerlings dd are free to make that change wo upsetting anything else its also faster since dd dont have to move robb to the crag and back that shes from volantis mostly means that she does not have strings attacheda noble westerosi house would have to deal in some way or another with what the conspirators dealt them some foreign noble girl married to a traitor can be killed with relative impunity and if she tells us that volantis is some other place along the way great"
"The Anti-Targ",2013-06-05,"it could be argued that the only people who knew talisa is a maegyr died at the red wedding aside from roose bolton and whos he going to tell so the maegyr family back in volantis arent going to know anything for a long time i cant imagine that talisas family name and her city of origin were chosen in a vaccuum so i think her murder will have further repercussions in a future season the volantines are in the story in the books talisas appearance just puts them in the story earlier with a bit more of a connection to westeros and a lot more reason to want to go there and kick some arse depending on the political situation there if the maegyrs arent in charge when volantis declares war on dany then talisas murder in westeros gives the maegyrs reason to seize power and then ally with dany omg i just had a horrible thought what if they decide to make an untalisa instead of an uncat michelle fairley has spoken with such finality and emotion about leaving the show but no ones interviewed oona about leaving"

"The Idiots Lantern",2013-06-26,"im talking about what choices affect the story in no way does it change anything from how it went with jeyne that was my pointits the opposite of how things went with jeyne unless you count the plot important thing of robbs breaking his word to walder frey really that had to happen for the story to go where we know its going to go other then that and the fact robb loved both of them the two characters are pretty much opposites jeyne is sweet ignorant weakwilled and oblivious talisa is assertive adventurous strongwilled and idealistic jeyne is from an old northern family talisa isnt even from westeros at all the story went where it had to go because talisa made choices that actually got it to go thereeta aside from them idiotically changing it to where she went to the wedding and her deathwhats idiotic about it are you one of the jeyne westerling is pregnant people because that theory was always kinda bs blackfish did not rescue the real jeyne he will not bring robbs son from the wilderness to avenge his father and all evidence to the contrary is fans seeing what they want to seebesides rikkon is the one whos going to bring back the starks long live the black wolfyou seriously believe that marrying robb when the tywin lannister is around the corner is brings less dishonorshes from volantis and shes actively scornful of the arguments between westerosi lords what does she care about tywin lannister she married robb because she wanted to and one thing she was not was not concerned about was honor she never gave it a thoughtthan going the route of that woman who was raped in the books and marrying some ambitious knight somewheretalisa isnt in the books so youll have to explain this statement do you mean tyshaand what does it matter she chose to sleep with robb nowhere does it say that agency is freedom from causalityi agree but at least she could have theoretically chosen differently there was nobody standing over her shoulder with their love potions and their contraceptives making sure everything went according to planrobb is not her kingyes he is thats why he was staying in the westerling house her family on the other hand wanted to be on the winning sideshe did go against the will of her true king joffrey or more importantly tywin her family is probably not happy about their new position at all allied with an enemy when their liege punishes treason with complete destruction if they were happy their mother wouldnt have drugged herher family was probably thrilled to be in a position to win no matter what happened if robb won the war well their daughter is queen and their house is now one of the most powerful in the north if as it happened it looks like robb is not going to win they are wellplaced to do lord tywin a few favors he wont forget like make sure robb has no heirs and loses the alliance of the freys a lannister always pays his debtswith all this at stake i think her mother would definitely have drugged her daughter with a love potion and thrown her at the griefstricken lad or maybe she didnt have to maybe she saw her daughter sighing over the handsome young king and saw an opportunity well probably never know for sureits still what we would call a choice and she made it she could have gone lollys it probably would have been better for everyone she didnt regardless again she did not trip and fall on robbs penis she did not suddenly lose her maidenhead in some magical accident she chose to do it this whole thing was set off by her i find it strange that youre ignoring thisi find it strange that you forget that this was a moment of extreme vulnerability for both of them robb had just learned of the sack of winterfell and the deaths of his brothers jeyne wanted to comfort him in his grief and momma just happens to have the potions on hand to make both of them feel better when their judgement was already impairedi know im guessing when i say that momma drugged jayne as well she probably didnt have to hormones could have done the work for her maybe she just made the most of an opportunity knowing what happens between young people at moments of weakness and knowing that loosing the freys will be a blow to robb and lannisters always pay their debtsor it could just be love unless theres any reason to think otherwise this pedantry about x only thinking theyre in love is pointlessits also irrelevant jeyne was never free to leave robb where would she go what becomes of disgraced deflowed noble girlsexcept no seriously you have a weird definition of powerless both parties could have done otherwise they deliberately picked out the most inexpedient pathneither party could do otherwise if jeyne doesnt marry him shes stigmatized for life if robb doesnt marry her his stark honor has to deal with his taking adventage and ruining the life of this innocent girl who wanted nothing more then to help him they both did their dutyyou mean like jeyne nursed robbwithout the obvious ulterior motiveas opposed to jeyne who just nursed then slept with robb resulting in him remembering her   married him knowing he was promised to someone else and stayed with himnone of which was really her idea her mother masterminded it allher choices dont really change anything right the change can not have been that great when the character youre claiming has no agency is achieved the same thing causally as talisaexcept talisa was free to leave so every moment she spent with robb was her choice jeyne never had that optionand agency based on she talked to the boy and the boy noticed her is funny i have to sayits better then the boy and girl slept together once so now theyre married at least robb and talisa have a relationship before they get hitchedyour argument really only works if one buys that jeyne had no agency in the first placeyou have proof that she did knowing what we know of her motherthe rest of my argument is basically pedantry the important question is so even if this is true why does this matter why is this a defense talisa is really just as morally bankrupt or perhaps better to say politically disastrous as jeyne in fact more so jeyne was a childand talisa is an adult an adult who through her good intentions and noble ideals causes an atrocity to occur this is a common theme in game of thrones those who stand up for higher ideals get cut down brutally if you think this story has a happy ending you havent been paying attentiontalisa is bankrupt by her own moral code the same code she used to slam robb early on only to ignore when it suited her from then onnothing just hamfisted attempts to get us to care for hersuccessful ones in my case i knew she had to die so her displays of strength and will were that much sadder she married robb knowing he wasnt perfect but deciding to work with him to make things better hed convinced her of his noble intentions and she was going to help him realize them we can add her to the list of people whos intrinsic goodness get her brutalized in the end edited by the idiots lantern 26 june 2013  0739 pm"

doesnt marry her his stark honor has to deal with his taking adventage and ruining the life of this innocent girl who wanted nothing more then to help him they both did their dutyi think youre severely overestimating the amount of duty involved marrying robb is a dangerous political move that could be the end of the westerlings and robbhas no reason at all to marry her he can simply move on he can offer to take her as a mistress he can just go away and let her deal with it they can pretend that it didnt happen and quickly marry her off to someone to hungry to know or careand no one will give a fuck or rather they wont give a measurable fuckall this talk of honor is bullshit when push comes to shove people expect this shit from nobles and will be glad that their king didnt let one of their most important alliances get fucked up because of some lannister vassals daughteryoure greatly overselling the pressures on robb here the idea that he has no choice here is bafflingwithout the obvious ulterior motivenone of which was really her idea her mother masterminded it allas far as we know jeynes mother wrote to tywin after the fact and started drugging her to avoid children this whole jeynes mother is palpatine is convenient for your argument but again unconvincedexcept talisa was free to leave so every moment she spent with robb was her choice jeyne never had that optionjeyne chose to stayits better then the boy and girl slept together once so now theyre married at least robb and talisa have a relationship before they get hitchedbetter in what regard because it conforms to what you expect of a love story both are contrived situations id argue that westerners are simply already primed for the robbtalisa story doesnt make it betteryou have proof that she did knowing what we know of her motherif you wish to turn jeynes mother into some sort of demonic spidermonster pulling every string of her personality and removing any free will youre free to do soi remain skepticaland talisa is an adult an adult who through her good intentions and noble ideals causes an atrocity to occur good intentions what good intentions bullshit she wanted to get married to

"mrlukeduke",2013-06-03,"jeyne preggers theory never made sense to me either i like to think this was their way of finally closing the topic interesting about the blackfish too"
"Stag Country",2013-06-03,"the theory made sense and was quite soundparticularly the part about the little sister seemingly not accounted for as jaime watches them leave riverrun it was however not openly stated in the book and was based on speculation what im bummed about is that we now may not have the exchange between jaime and the blackfish and we definately wont have the scene where jeyne or fake jeyne has to had the crown over to jaime could have been a good tv moment"
"Lord Tyrion's Whore",2013-06-03,"to be frank the clue suffered from overanalysis as many minor details do cat didnt think in the books she has wide hips but she has good hips  that doesnt necessarily mean too wide and for jaime being a male her hips may look narrow esp if she generally didnt care much about herself since rw so she was probably a bit underfed as well agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree  kind of like the evidence for talisa being a spy"
"The Monkey",2013-06-03,"wise choice by grrm with bran rickon sansa and jon snow already candidates for the next lordship of winterfell we dont need robbs child to mess things up further"
"FuriousGeorge",2013-06-03,"wow i am so glad there are some people on this forum who can think about the connection between the show and the books logically and practically without just robotically regurgitating show is not book canon i agree with whoever said upthread that she might have been pregnant and miscarried the child but as for robb having fathered an heir  not going to happen as for those who say robb did father a child but the child wont have that much of an impact on the story which is why they could cut it out of the shows familiarise yourself chekovs law"
"flinn",2013-06-03,"agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree  kind of like the evidence for talisa being a spy i disagree if anything the gave us a red herring they went out of their way to point towards talisa being a spyespecially the scene where tywin says we are waiting on the young wolf to fail and he will not fail unless we help him the very next scene shows robb meeting talisahttpwwwwetpaintalannisterspy red herring but the evidence was there to support it not just overanalyzing"
"kephv",2013-06-03,"no it doesnt unless robb not naming jon his heir disproves the fact that it means something in the books or that not including coldhands means that he wont be important or show up again i never believed this theory but i wouldnt put too much weight on the things the show does differently from the books"
"FuriousGeorge",2013-06-03," but that is clearly not an apt comparison in both those cases the show writers could easily take a slightly different path to arrive at the same point how can robb father an heir in the show from the grave if it is going to happen in the books if you accept that robb fathering an heir would have an impact on the plot then you must also accept that it cant have happened as there is now no possible way that it could happen in the show"
"Reposado",2013-06-03,"i dont really think anything on the show can confirm anything in the books if they can change things that we know happen in the books they can change things we think happened in the books and if they need something to help them out now they will clearly sacrifice a potential plot element down the road"
"FuriousGeorge",2013-06-03," how can you be so obtuse you really think that if robb fathered a child that becomes important down the line in the books dd wouldnt know about it and if they knew about it they would just go nah dont like that really important part of the story this is not like the omission of strong belwas or jesters or the death of mago this is something that would become fundamental to the story if it were true"
"Zorral",2013-06-03,"has there been any other television series created from a long multivolume workstillinprogressofbeingwritten while the television series is being broadcast the sookie stackhouse books tend to stand alone they dont count so much and neither the television series team or the author made claims they were one and the same as they so clearly are not it feels very much as if the book series is going to merge with the television series and following or not as they choose the authors choices for the conclusion the television series will be essentially finishing the books series as it concludes the television series"
"King Tam Stark",2013-06-03,"yep just like it proves bran is the only person ever anywhere to warg a humanadds credability to the theory that theres warging in the theon sample chapter from twow the op the close up of talisas stomach getting stabbed was possibly a nod to book readers that he didnt get jeyne with child if that makes any sense lol"

"Cheese Pudding",2013-06-04,"well i never thought that jeynes possible pregnancy would be that important to the books justregarding the black fish she wont play a major role at the books and since imo we wont see the future it doesnt really matters if robbs son turns to be winterfells heir or not but as i said she can still be pregnant so summarizing my opinion it does not prove shes not pregnant but it gives 999999 of chance that she wont play a major role at twow andor ados"

"Abaddon",2013-06-05,"i think the more interesting detail is that robb didnt make jon his heir as in the books of course robb wouldnt do that since talisa was pregnant it wouldnt have made sense but that means that little plot point is either irrelevant in the grand scheme of things or the show has deviated on a pretty central point im going to guess the former"
"Greywolf2375",2013-06-05,"because they wanted robb to have a hot onscreen romance with a sexy young exotic modern nurse rather than a quiet honorable innocent offscreen marriage to a young girl who doesnt get to have any steamy sex scenes in a war tenthopefully sarcastic  they could have given jeyne any background they wanted from the standpoint of how they met where her family is what her personality is etc unless the westerlings play some more important role in the future the name change didnt buy anythingthe theory made sense and was quite soundparticularly the part about the little sister seemingly not accounted for as jaime watches them leave riverrunit was however not openly stated in the book and was based on speculationwhat im bummed about is that we now may not have the exchange between jaime and the blackfish and we definately wont have the scene where jeyne or fake jeyne has to had the crown over to jaime could have been a good tv momentno the theory was not sound  it was based on nonexistence of information rather than what was given in the booksi disagree if anything the gave us a red herring they went out of their way to point towards talisa being a spyespecially the scene where tywin says we are waiting on the young wolf to fail and he will not fail unless we help himthe very next scene shows robb meeting talisahttpwwwwetpaintalannisterspyred herring but the evidence was there to support it not just overanalyzingagreed  i think this is one of the few times in the tv show they have been able to really pull of a bait and switchi doubt the information of 1 bannerman trumps the will of the dead kingwell considering the information that bannerman would have would state that the bastard son of ned stark is actually the son of lyanna stark and rhaegar yeah it would trump itagain dd know how it will end do you really think if robb had a baby in the books and they knew about it that they would still kill it that would be way too much of a big thing to change even they arent that stupidyes  the killing of the dead usurpers baby wouldnt be a big event from a plot standpoint weve seen that happen before with the reputation of the mountain smashing a baby to death based on what the lannisters would know i could easily see them ordering young eddard or whatever the kids name would be offed"
"Tadco26",2013-06-05,"there are plenty of compelling arguements to be made just based on the book to say jeyne isnt pregnant it still doesnt change the fact that talisas fate on the show doesnt prove anything it wouldnt prove or disprove the theory any more if talisa wasnt pregnant on the show the kid could die later in the books the starks could remain so far out of power that the heir just doesnt matter to the final outcome xaro has a role in the future while in the show he appears to be left to die and since his character was completely different anyway there isnt much chance he could fill the same role even if he survived being locked in the vault jhaqo has a role in the future and has died on the show irri and jhiqui are still alive in the books the show doesnt necessarily care who is alive or dead in the books on a side note i never agreed with the idea that getting to the same destination means nothing changed if one person hitch hikes across the country from los angeles gets mugged and has no money or aid has to sleep outside beg for food and barely makes it in one piece and another one takes a first class flight without incident and they both travel to new york you cant really say nothing important was different between their experiences because they got to the same spot the experiences along the way are what shape the character and make the story"
"Lord Joker Of FunLand",2013-06-05,"well considering the information that bannerman would have would state that the bastard son of ned stark is actually the son of lyanna stark and rhaegar yeah it would trump itno it wouldnt why would anybody believe it any bannerman of any lord can make up a story like that just because its howland reed people will believe makes no sense"

"Ross2013",2013-06-05,"maybe theres going to be a flashback to before the rw where robb does name jon heir adding it to the previous episode would have announced too much to unsulliedive always thought the will is just an unnecessary red herring so i hope its out of the show at best assuming robb could circumvent the westeros laws of succession its just a piece of paper as cersei once said eddard had a piece of a paper too that cost him his head plus stannis would have made jon legitimate jon didnt want it"
"Ser Pounce FTW",2013-06-05,"plus stannis would have made jon legitimate jon didnt want iti believe robb wanting to make jon lord of winterfell would have been different in jons eyes than stannis wanted to do it still robbs will would seem to be not as important as i thought given it hasnt been included on the show"
"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2013-06-05,"i think the will has a role to play in the books whereas on the show jon being ned starks son a proven leader and competent politician will be enough for the northern conspirers to look to him i subscribe to the gnc theory but without the will im not sure how theyll explain jons acceptance of it all perhaps it wont matter since after adwd he might be done with the nw or the nw might be done altogether and thus he will accept"
"Weeping Sore",2013-06-05,"yeah i dont get the dany s2 thing so they took an already boring storyline and made it even worse but the end result was the same  which is that basically nothing interesting happens and dany gets a ship and decides to go somewhere other than westeros to let her dragons growafter this season every dany scene could just be a musical montage of her feeding her dragons and frolicking with them and then one of them tries to lift her into the air no not big enough yet next episode same scene but the dragons are a liiiittle bigger she would also be naked sometimes there seasons 45 rewritten for dany"

"ThinPaperWings",2013-06-06,"clearly fans of the theory that jeyne was pregnant and can still deliver an heir are not going to let it go and can use the bookshow divide as justification seems more emotionally driven than anything to me but everyones entitled to their views still im convinced that robb will not have an heir i agree that an heir would be such a significant plot point that dd would not exclude it so blatantly we all know heirs are a huge deal in westeros so you cant really have an unimportant stark heir i would also argue that robbs story is supposed to be a tragic one he makes a tragic though understandable mistake that costs him his life and forfeits all his military success for his mistake to also lead to his redemption or the redemption of his linejust as good in the world of the books by an heir is thematically stifling grrm knows better hes given us plenty of characters who can rebuilt andor revenge the starksjon bran arya sansa rickon lady stoneheart"

"topopox",2013-06-06,"the issue on why the theory is kinda convincing besides from diferences of description of jeyne from cat  jaimes povs is the fact that brynden and edmure seemed so full of themselves about something personally i dont think that the blackfish was raising the direwolf banner out of nothing he seemed way too sure and even though edmure was smiling i dont buy that he was smiling just because the blackfish escaped considering that he is being sent to casterly rock as hostage things just dont add up to confirm one way or the otherthere were many arguments against the theory though if i should add one against it is how jeyne reacts when jaime asks for her pregnancyimo the murder of talisa on the tv series does not confirm mostly because theyre not the same thing starting season 2 the differences between the books are way too notable and the adaptation may deviate on some points dd were given indications and some elements on how is going to end the story whatever they do in the middle can pass without warning and finally her death was made mostly to compensate the absence of robbs bannermen in the rwwhat it probably confirms is that if jeyne does carry robbs child it wont be playing some mayor endgame role in the next bookswe should wait until martin shows us what will happen in the arc of jeyneblackfish if he plans to continue with thatedit first post hi"

"Redmjh",2013-06-02,"the scenes right outside the twins werent hectic enough there was no sense of urgency from arya so when the hound knocked her out it was just awkward i would have liked to have seen chaos with her running towards the doors and then getting knocked out the red wedding itself it didnt seem epic enough i guess maybe it was scored badly but something was just missing the scene between rob and cat as he gets killed seemed canned to me i think michelle fairley dropped the ball on the anguish of that scene everything seemed a few beats too late her scream both throat cuttings etc"
"Lord Bored",2013-06-02,"i kinda wish rooses the lannisters send their regards was spoken a bit slower it also wouldve been great had there been a couple seconds of silence  as he looked robb in the eye before saying anything that wouldve made the stabbing carry more of an impact the rains of castamere too i wish was more prominent"

"Pinkie Baelish",2013-06-02,"the pacing seemed a bit too slow for me everything seemed a bit startstop while i imagined the entire scene to be extremely climactic think neds house guard getting killed in s1 climactic also robbs death felt a little flat i expected it to be more cinematic as we see a full shot of roose stabbing robb but otherwise i really liked it"

"Lord Tyrion's Whore",2013-06-03,"i guess i am in agreement with everyone else when i say that robbs death was a bit of a letdown i like the description of it as a driveby stabbing and i was also a bit annoyed when roose said the lannisters instead of jaime lannister but i understand why they did it they didnt want anyone to get the idea that jaime had a hand in planning the event as hes off on his goodguy arc and everythings more simplistic in the show i thought catelyn went out on more of a high note i also would have enjoyed a bit of face clawing but her scene was still pretty good i was very disappointed that arya didnt let grey wind loose so he could go out like a champion instead of being shot in a pen but i am guessing they didnt want to spend all the money on yet another wolf battle in the same episode speaking of wolf battles the queenscrown scene was probably what i thought was the most problematic in the show because they had to cram far too much into it orells death the eagle attacking jons face bran suddenly warging for the very first time consciously osha and rickon leaving they stuck a lot in there in a few minutes and i would have enjoyed it more i think if theyd spread that stuff out across the season nitpicking aside though i really did enjoy the episode its not as good as season 2s climax but it was still pretty awesome and i imagine that for nonbook readers who remained unspoiled it must have been quite an hour"

"dni",2013-06-03,"hmm pretty sure my opinion completely flies in the face of the general consensus but i thought the entire rw was completely awful it was the most poorly done climactic scene thus far in the entire television series it felt completely staged the way the camera angles were set up the way all the major players just stood there alone in place should of killed the lights and put a spotlight on them and had them say something really dramatic or maybe sing it in latin it was like some lame community theater rendition from the second cat screamed robb and slapped bolton for his betrayal i expected all hell to break loose tables to be flipped people to be fighting for their lives and dying tragically instead it was total melodrama bolton bolts stage right across the entire scene with his henchman which was hilarious looking and robb doesnt even react then a guy walks up uncontested to the queen and stabs her repeatedly anddd people still not responding robb full of arrows a couple guys put their drinks down and stand up the timing during the entire thing is completely drawn out in some places and feels like its on fast forward in others the stabbing is quick then she falls to the floor grunting in slow motion cat instantly transitions to catatonia mid murder but then we have this weird drawn out bit before someone comes from stage right to slit her throat the gore is overdone in the wrong way gore is perfectly fine for a scene like this if its realistic but this was comical cartoon or anime gore unfortunately robb the man of action young wolf was just confused and mildly sad the entire time maybe the food disagreed with him i didnt like the change to catatonic cat either harhar completely awful in other news no cold hands bran stuff slightly rushed but didnt bother me too much rickon actually had a nice little performance i thought jon stuff crammed but again somewhat acceptable dany could of waited for the entire episode titled after her but eh minor nitpicks"

match the death they gave greywind here was so lacking in dramatic force or quality you barely even cared that he was killed4 another thing that makes robb<U+0080><U+0099>s death less bleak is his childish disgruntlement towards walder frey throughout the episode at this point in the books robb is genuinely sorry for what he did to his house and wants to make amends he sustains every slight walder throws at him without a flinch and handles himself extremely well at the twins in the face of every petulant frey it<U+0080><U+0099>s hard to feel sorry for him here with those petty school boy heroics5 most of the deaths in this episode were incredibly underwhelming compared to the deaths in a storm of swords this was for many reasons unfortunately first of all overly dramatic music was being played over everything when we should have been treated to nothing but the rains of castamere slowly digressing into the boom doom boom of the musicians<U+0080><U+0099> drums secondly robb<U+0080><U+0099>s actor did an absolutely horrible job at displaying any sort of confusion shock fear or despair i heard he cried after he discovered how his character was to be killed but you never would have guessed he actually cared from his performancecatelyn<U+0080><U+0099>s actor was more than capable of carrying out some of the horrific things grr martin described in his books but

come to understand indepth from cat<U+0080><U+0099>s perspective since the first book jeyne<U+0080><U+0099>s family were also supposed to be suspected conspirators in the red wedding their daughter was not planned to be killed along with the starks despite jeyne<U+0080><U+0099>s alleged devotion to robb as i mentioned before a huge plot element hinges on her and her baby by the fifth book blackfish holds riverrun against the lannisters with jeyne tight under guard he defends her with his life why would he do this if not to protect an heir now what are they going to come up with when grr martin reveals jeyne is pregnant with the king in the north<U+0080><U+0099>s sonforget the main characters for a second part of the horror of the red wedding was that so many people you were starting to like were all being slaughtered like farm animals it is too much to expect to see minor characters such as dacey mormont and smalljon umber but surely their roles could have been replaced with existing characters in the show characters who in the books did not matter much lopping off the greatjon<U+0080><U+0099>s head in place of his son<U+0080><U+0099>s would have been an excellent deviation as the greatjon is supposed to be held captive then hardly ever mentioned again instead we watch a bunch of bearded men who we<U+0080><U+0099>ve never even seen before being killed in humdrum fashions no crossbow bolts through the mouth no beheadings none of thati doubt it would have had an impact anyway since the gore in this episode was completely unrealistic and tainted by hollywood action movies people do not instantly lose consciousness when their throat is cut then fall to the floor dead when your esophagus is severed you lose the ability to breathe through your mouthnose and begin breathing out of a hole in your neck this is largely impossible though since the wound bleeds profusely clogging your esophagus with fluids you essentially drown on your own blood in a panic making all sorts of horrible snorting noises for up to three minutes i<U+0080><U+0099>m not even sure grr martin was aware of this before writing the red wedding but slitting throats was never described as one fell graze upon the neck catelyn sawed through this person<U+0080><U+0099>s throat until they died stabbing a person in their heart is another matter but looks like bolton missed the mark roose had a tiny dagger in place of a longsword and apparently decided to stab robb in the lower part of his lung causing instant death<U+0080> while all this is happening inside the castle the stark host outside is supposed to be burning to death by the masses as a result of giant feast tents rigged to catch fire and collapse on top of them rather than depict the elaborate trap grr martin conceived it is simply implied all the stark men outside are put to the sword good thing the viewers have no idea how many stark men there are in comparison to bolton men or else they would surely question the effectiveness of an open armed conflict 6 roose<U+0080><U+0099>s performance here was a huge disappointment i was setting my expectations high assuming this actor would be the one to do everything right i was thoroughly enjoying his portrayal of the leech lord up until this point he seemed so smug whereas in the books he barely made an attempt to talk to anyone he played his part perfectly while most of the freys were a nervous wreck but he was never cheeky about it here he looks like he<U+0080><U+0099>s taking great pleasure in taunting the starks as if he hates them roose is a man who plays for the winning team and takes no particular joy in betrayal he just accepts that it<U+0080><U+0099>s practical and carries out his atrocities without guilt in addition to screwing up his behavior the actor got his body movements all wrong as well roose is supposed to glide in and out of the hall as confident and smooth as can be here he darts around ducking his head and lunging out of harm<U+0080><U+0099>s way it<U+0080><U+0099>s just so unlike the lord of the dreadfort but most importantly he says to robb just before he stabs him <U+0080><U+009C>the lannisters send their regards<U+0080><U+009D> i<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry but why did you change that from <U+0080><U+009C>the kingslayer sends his regards<U+0080><U+009D> why do you think grr martin set it up that way cat is supposed to believe jaime had a hand in her son<U+0080><U+0099>s demise from that statement cat freed jaime so she instantly thinks she<U+0080><U+0099>s killed her own son with her foolish actions she<U+0080><U+0099>s supposed to believe that jaime betrayed her later on in the series but of course viewers will never catch on to this7 lastly sandor  arya<U+0080><U+0099>s story was poorly done here arya was supposed to be desperate trying to get into the twins despite all the bloodshed so that she could see her mother and brother once again the hound somehow managed to knock her out and carry her off unseen without a fret but in the books it<U+0080><U+0099>s a fight for survival frey men attack them and sandor has to kill a few with an axe before arya makes a run for it just as she<U+0080><U+0099>s about to reach the castle the hound hits her atop the head it would have been a much more emotional scene to see arya kicking and screaming as sandor tries to subdue her like it was in a storm of swordsi was so hyped up for this moment ever since i read it in the books i can<U+0080><U+0099>t tell you how immensely let down i am this was meant to be the most significant event in the entire series and i do not feel they did it justice by any means viewers of the show will never know how much better it could have been how much better it should have been i<U+0080><U+0099>m not done with the series but i can definitely say now that i prefer grr martin<U+0080><U+0099>s works over benioff and weiss<U+0080><U+0099>s any day if they would just stick to the damned books instead of making their own changes all the time i<U+0080><U+0099>d be happy cut what you need to but don<U+0080><U+0099>t add things that were never written down by the author that<U+0080><U+0099>s rule no1 of any adaption i can only see this getting worse as the story progresses unless the producers get back on track and start doing things the way they should have done all along i have no more hope left for game of thrones"

"Cas Stark",2013-06-03,"it was good for what it was the tv version a rw about cat and robb and talisa i missed the sense of loyalty and fierceness you got in the books where you saw how hard the northerners still fought despite being ambushed here everybody goes down and the only person trying to save robb is his mother also and no surprise coming from me too much focus on talisa and the young lovers angle and over the top focus on the pregnancy angle especially since the tragdy of the young couple in love dying wasnt even in the book at all and good grief how dumb was show robb that hes kissing his wife in front of walder frey also didnt like greywind going down without taking anyone with him i also didnt see manderley in the scene and i was looking for him because i knew he had been cast lol so much for the north cat laughing and the ned loves my hair line wouldnt have worked in tv it only worked in the book because we know what shes thinking i did like that they made her the only one who sees and sense any dangersince show robb was much too stupid to perceive same he was too busy wishing he could look at his wifes butt all the time and i will now officially say that oona chaplin is not a good actress that blank stare look is the same one she had in half her scenes"
"mafalda",2013-06-03,"meh i want to love this episode i really do it was an amazing episode but the rw fell kinda short and that just ruins the whole thing here are my nitpickslike others are saying it was getting kinda comical with the hitandrun throat cuttings frey jumps into the frame cuts a throat jumps out bolton jumps into the frame stabs robb jumps out cat screams and looks sad then another frey jumps in cuts her throat jumps outthe awkward cats getting suspicious moments ruins the surprisethe stabbing the pregnant chick in the belly it was weird and so overthetop that it was almost comicalrobb seemed to lack emotion pain fear etc again he just looked kinda sad i mean crossbow bolts in your chest pregnant wife stabbed to death bannermen slaughtered and he just looked kinda sadlack of stark bannermenno catgoescrazyandtearsherface and her hair didnt get cut just a cheesy hitandrun throat cut after an anticlimactic scream and anguished lookweird timing in that whole scene lingering too long on some moments cat getting killed rushing past others bolton stabbing robband then aryathey needed that to be the last scene it would be simple arya seeing all the chaos and commotion strangely lacking in the show like others have mentioned and then just cut to black with the sound of her being hit and falling to the ground the way they did it theres no question about if shes dead or noti wonder how dd could watch this ep in the editing room and thought yes this is the brilliant its the best we could have possibly done the throat slitting was sooo terribly done no other weapon was used hardly a few crossbows but no beheading hardly any stabbings no tables flipped over used for protection no use of grey wind the north did fight back they still lost but goodness give them their last honori didnt care for how they seemed to take yet another crap on jon they make it so ygrette actually knows jon is still loyal to the watch yet she loves him so much that she keeps his secret and remains in love with him anyway to then have him just run off and abandon her like that when she was fighting her own kind in an effort to defend him was just crappy it made jon look like an ass that was just using her and had no actual feelings for her in the books his leaving seemed more understandable here it seemed like he abandoned her needlesslyi dont remember how this went down in the books sad to say i rushed through jons story in the booksthese are my complaints there are a lot of them let me begin by saying this is my least favorite episode of the entire series and i am utterly disappointed benioff and weiss were the whole reason i started reading a song of ice and fire to begin with game of thrones inspired me to pick up a novel and finish it for the very first time in my nineteen years of life that novel in turn inspired me to read four more after that i trusted them completely with this the red wedding was their ultimate goal in the series and theyve said it from the start i am still in disbelief that they would butcher it so badly but i digress onto business1 robbs arrival at the twins was an event in and of itself his arrival and his death should have been spread out between two episodes as it was in the books with two successive catelyn chapters the entire event happened way too fast for those who have not read the books greywind robb<U+0080><U+0099>s direwolf who has been largely missing from the show until randomly appearing in a kennel this episode attacks some freys in the rain as they greet the starks to their castle robb

come2 blackfish  jeyne talisa are supposed to be safe at riverrun not at the twins with robb  catelyn jeyne is still alive in the books supposedly with robb<U+0080><U+0099>s unborn child an entire

heart is another matter but looks like bolton missed the mark roose had a tiny dagger in place of a longsword and apparently decided to stab robb in the lower part of his lung causing instant death<U+0080> while all this is happening inside the castle the stark host outside is supposed to be burning to death by the masses as a result of giant feast tents rigged to catch fire and collapse on top of them rather than depict the elaborate trap grr martin conceived it is simply implied all the stark men outside are put to the sword good thing the viewers have no idea how many stark men there are in comparison to bolton men or else they would surely question the effectiveness of an open armed conflict 6 roose<U+0080><U+0099>s performance here was a huge disappointment i was setting my expectations high assuming this actor would be the one to do everything right i was thoroughly enjoying his portrayal of the leech lord up until this point he seemed so smug whereas in the books he barely made an attempt to talk to anyone he played his part perfectly while most of the freys were a nervous wreck but he was never cheeky about it here he looks like he<U+0080><U+0099>s taking great pleasure in taunting the starks as if he hates them roose is a man who plays for the winning team and takes no particular joy in betrayal he just accepts that it<U+0080><U+0099>s practical and carries out his atrocities without guilt in addition to screwing up his behavior the actor got his body movements all wrong as well roose is supposed to glide in and out of the hall as confident and smooth as can be here he darts around ducking his head and lunging out of harm<U+0080><U+0099>s way it<U+0080><U+0099>s just so unlike the lord of the dreadfort but most importantly he says to robb just before he stabs him <U+0080><U+009C>the lannisters send their regards<U+0080><U+009D> i<U+0080><U+0099>m sorry but why did you change that from <U+0080><U+009C>the kingslayer sends his regards<U+0080><U+009D> why do you think grr martin set it up that way cat is supposed to believe jaime had a hand in her son<U+0080><U+0099>s demise from that statement cat freed jaime so she instantly thinks she<U+0080><U+0099>s killed her own son with her foolish actions she<U+0080><U+0099>s supposed to believe that jaime betrayed her later on in the series but of course viewers will never catch on to this7 lastly sandor  arya<U+0080><U+0099>s story was poorly done here arya was supposed to be desperate trying to get into the twins despite all the bloodshed so that she could see her mother and brother once again the hound somehow managed to knock her out and carry her off unseen without a fret but in the books it<U+0080><U+0099>s a fight for survival frey men attack them and sandor has to kill a few with an axe before arya makes a run for it just as she<U+0080><U+0099>s about to reach the castle the hound hits her atop the head it would have been a much more emotional scene to see arya kicking and screaming as sandor tries to subdue her like it was in a storm of swordsi was so hyped up for this moment ever since i read it in the books i can<U+0080><U+0099>t tell you how immensely let down i am this was meant to be the most significant event in the entire series and i do not feel they did it justice by any means viewers of the show will never know how much better it could have been how much better it should have been i<U+0080><U+0099>m not done with the series but i can definitely say now that i prefer grr martin<U+0080><U+0099>s works over benioff and weiss<U+0080><U+0099>s any day if they would just stick to the damned books instead of making their own changes all the time i<U+0080><U+0099>d be happy cut what you need to but don<U+0080><U+0099>t add things that were never written down by the author that<U+0080><U+0099>s rule no1 of any adaption i can only see this getting worse as the story progresses unless the producers get back on track and start doing things the way they should have done all along i have no more hope left for game of throneshugs you and pats you on the back because i feel the exact same way you took the words right out of my mouthseriously though for dd to go around saying this one chapter was the entire reason they made this series they sure did pull down their pants and take a great shit on it s1 was so brilliantly done ill never forget the magic they worked then s2 was so very meh but i said s3 is when theyd come back times three i just knew they would get this right even with the whole talisa change but then they started showing less and less of robb and cat then they never showed any stark bannermen greatjon where are you grey wind only appeared for about 5 seconds this entire season robb was planning to take casterly rock wtf they started doing things that made me go uh oh at the red wedding and when they showed the preview and i saw that it would be sharing screen time with so many other arcs that was my last red flagthis was the one thing i wanted them to get right that all of us wanted them to get righti pity us readers because we will never get that brilliance that we have been waiting for years for i pity the unsullied because even if they thought that nonsense was good they will never know how good it could have been how good it really was i feel so cheated i hated cats strange silent death with another quick throat slit and that was just it for people saying her death in the books was over the top that was the entire reason she died if she hadnt lost her mind and gone apeshit she would still be alive but her going crazy is why they killed her and yes ned loved my hair was an internal monolgue but she could have obviously opened her mouth and said it duh michele farily is such a talented actress i just wish they would have used her more i hope dd give an interview about how a lot of the book readers feel about this episodeand like i said in a previous post dany is my favorite character and i get normally get irritated when she isnt in an episode but she did not belong in this one it was such a stark centered episode and to throw in yunkai completely threw it off balance for me the time spent on her arc completely deserved to be spent on the red weddingto make this post a little lighter lets all take a moment of silence to imagine the smalljon bitch slapping people with a mutton legthank you"
"The hairy bear",2013-06-03,"my nitpicksi think that having poor musicians was a thing that they should have kept it doesnt cost anything and would have made the whole scene more roundedthey should have insisted more in how the stark bannermen were getting drunkroose runing away from catelyn was dumbfailure at transmiting the sense of chaos during the killings i missed knocking down tables northmen entering at the last time seemengly saving the dayit was out of character to have roose saying his final line to robb with fury instead of calmly murdering him with coldnesssandor hiting arya came out of nowhere since they werent able to transmit that she was out of control maise was acting just dumbstruck not crazygrey worms bostaff fighting style was cool but completely inconsistent with his background as an infantry soldiergregors nancy boyi agree with most of your points but theres a couple of instances where i think you are not being reasonable2 blackfish  jeyne talisa are supposed to be safe at riverrun not at the twins with robb  catelyn jeyne is still alive in the books supposedly with robb<U+0080><U+0099>s unborn child an entire plot element currently hinges on whether or not that child is a boyjeyne is not pregnant in the books the fact that some fans maintain the crackpot theory that she is should not be considered at all by the showrunners since talisa and robbs child do not exist in the books in this case killing them was the decision most faithful choice3 greywind dies after robb this is extremely important sentimentallywise as robb<U+0080><U+0099>s real last words are <U+0080><U+009C>greywind<U+0080><U+0080><U+009D> not <U+0080><U+009C>mother<U+0080><U+0080><U+009D> it is to be assumed robb wargs into his direwolf after he dies since this is the same moment greywind viciously attacks nearby freys who have not yet began their assault robb is betrayed killed by his own man wargs into his wolf then dies all over again it is part of his death and cutting that out of the show makes it considerably less tragic to match the death they gave greywind here was so lacking in dramatic force or quality you barely even cared that he was killedit is not to be assumed that grey wind dies after robb its assumed by you and some others but we just dont know as with the previous case is not fair to criticize the show for contradicting your uncofirmed theory my own interpretation of robbs last words was that he intended to say grey wind had warned us"

"Lady Lea",2013-06-03,"the one thing that bothered me the most was that cat killed walders wife and not one of his sons they did stress that robb was cats only son now or did she say first either way it could have been done and that walder had so many children he couldnt even remember all their names so it would have been even more gutwrenching to see her try to protect her only son when he was all like nah whatever i have many more about one of his own sons i would also have liked to see her take on one of the men instead of a girl its true that jinglebells was mentally challenged but to have her kill a son would have been more powerful than just have wife 9 killed i thought they hired that semifamous actor to play walders son because he would be the one to die and he doesnt look very tough cat already took on an assassin in the first season i dont see why they couldnt let her do her thing and you know a lot of people are commenting on the fridging of talisa and i think its a valid point its lazy storytelling but at the same time they cut all the important northeners from robbs circle the umbers the mormonts etc so it would have been hard to make the scene as poignant if it was just robb and cat there edited by lady lea 03 june 2013  1120 am"

"Mista C",2013-06-04,"my issues with this episode 1 i thought that the entire episode should have been at the twins just like blackwater last season they could have shown the first meeting with the freys when gw lashedout at one of them and acted all uneasy would have conveyed that even gw knew that something was not right here they could have also taken the time to better show how many stark soldiers were actually there for the wedding in the surrounding tents i know that they showed some horseplaying and what not but an aerial shot of all the tents and camps would have been great 2 scale of everything was not big enough but its only tv i guess even the hall where the massacre took place seemed too small to me 3 i really felt like the actor that played walder frey approached the role a little differently this time in season 1 he truly seemed like some super crusty old man who barely knew what was going on this time he seemed much too with it and together to me he did not seem nearly as old as in season 1 he played it this time like a modernday pervy old man and not some old medeivel lord who has lost half his marbles i thought that his whole look at robb and wink wink hey shes not too bad huh expression when his daughter was revealed was very out of character is it just me 4 not nearly enough chaos outside of the twins things seemed too calm again this goes back to scale i just dont feel like they handled the exterior scenes very well 5 i really wanted to but i just could not get into the scenes with arya and the hound again if the entire episode would have been at the twins they could have spent much more time on their story it felt very rushed to me from the time they got there until the end they could have spent more time on them wandering through the camps on their way to the castle gates and more anticipation on trying to get in 6 no hound fighting frey solders i guess that this could happen next week but i think that the entire rw events should have been in the one episode and not spread out between two episodes same with the burning tents this was such a huge part of the rw and one aspect that really stood out to me 7 am i the only one who hates daario naharis edited by mista c 04 june 2013  0922 am"

"Lux in Tenebris",2013-06-04," i really would have liked to see grey wind unleashed  a few more moments of stark badassery were sorely needed i wish they made it seemed like arya was killed the hound swinging an axe at the back of her head  because that aspect really complimented the events of the rw well i really wish we could have had a few more stark bannermen there defending robb even if they were unnamed no one coming to his aid seemed weak  dislike talisa but i thought her stabbing added a level of gruesomeness that wouldnt have been there without manderly smalljon  daisy getting killed it also was the first oh shit moment at least where my roomates had realized that the shit had hit the fan liked the use of freys wife instead of the fool it works with his attitude towards womenhis wives and made more sense as a fair trade off for caetlyn also it required no explaining didnt mind the not clawing of the face that blank look of it all going to hell and cat giving up got the point across perfectly"

"Cadiva",2013-06-04,"not having greywind do his thing and taking out a few freys as it was in the book is perhaps my biggest issue with the episodei know people keep mentioning this but grey wind doesnt take out any freys at the red wedding hes said to have killed four frey wolfhounds and bitten off the arm of a frey guard before being felled by crossbow boltgrey wind kills loads of people at the battle of the whispering woods and at oxcross i think a lot of people are getting the events mixed up with his death at the twins"

"Winter In My Heart",2013-06-04,"am i the only one who found talisas killing so unbelievably fake i mean i know i know obviously someone is going to react rather out there and over the top if theyre stabbed in the stomach but somehow her death just seemed so silly to me which is actually a shame because i thought the acting of her character wasnt so bad in the episode up until that point when she looked dead and robb came over to hold her it looked so fake to me her looking dead that is even my mom who doesnt watch the show but only saw posts on tumblr said she thought talisa was alive when she saw a picture i almost give her a pass for how the actress choose to react when she was stabbed since obviously everything at the wedding was going to be a bit over the top but how she looked dead i cant let her slide on that one even people on law on order look more convincing looking as dead than she did but at least madden and especially michelle overpowered that scene anyway the only reason people remember talisa now is because of the brutal belly stabbing lol which even i had i hard time watching edited by winter in my heart 04 june 2013  0542 pm"

"booknerd2",2013-06-04,"she soared in most if i prefer a nuance i doubt it was her for example she was probably directed to pause before her throat was cut which i think lost its power because it was too long a pause i bet she did do a take raking her face and going mad and i am sure they cut it could be wrong though her face after she eyed the mail under the sleeve was priceless the whack to the face was perfect she was so angry and let loose like cat did in the book and she was at her finest when she held the knife to mrs frey and spoke to walder and and her son and tried to negotiate with frey and begged robb to just walk out she was magnificent"

"Inevittable",2013-05-13,"its been a while since the first time i read the scene but ive just read through it again its strange when read out of context how short the massacre scene actually is i think the thing that really sticks in my head is cat holding the knife to jinglebells throat i dont think about jinglebells but i can almost see the play of emotions across cats face as she wrestles with fear anger rage hope pain i too am wondering about how they show the treatment of the bodies they werent shy about showing neds head on a pike were they but mostly it comes down to the characters im terrible at predicting how things are going to go on screen im just excited to see what happens"

"iheartseverus",2013-05-13,"its interesting that you noted on a reread how short the actual massacre scene really was its been years since i read the rw and i wont ever read it again and my mental image is that the scene goes on and on and on past the point where i was gasping and horrified and nearly to the point of me screaming to me it was the single most viscerally shocking scene ive ever read and thats saying something because im middleaged collegeeducated and have been a voracious reader all my life another interesting bit of input is that later when i came to this board and learned of other readers reactions to the rw many many of them said they literally threw the book across the room thats exactly what i did and it wasnt because of anger or a fuck this reaction that came a few minutes laterinstead it was instinctiverid me of this horror exactly as a person would react if heshe were to look and see a scorpion or poisonous spider crawling up her arm fling it as far away as possible as fast as possible without a seconds rational thought best wishes to you with your projecta most interesting topic indeed"
"Tquinn BC",2013-05-13,"definitely the image of cat clawing at herself plus rob calling for grey wind sorry to go slightly of topic but does anyone just follow me for a sec think that a non book reader will see rob with a wolfs head and then jump to some crazy conclusion that hell spring back to like as a wolfman hybrid i mean really if your a non book reader and your jumping to conclusions trying to be that guy who is always predicting the end of movies you could really jump to that conclusion especially in a show like this that is unpredictable a little off topic but i didnt no where else to ask that question"

"Broken Fox",2013-05-13,"most vivid images  robb lying on the ground being stabbed by roose bolton  catelyn screaming and clawing at her face  and of course robbs corpse with the grey winds head attached"
"LordStoneheart",2013-05-13,"upon my first read of that chapter i was stunned and my heart was actually beating the image that stuck out in my mind the most and still does is catelyn watching the blood run down her arms while she laughs and says it tickles thats when i knew this chapter would end even worse than i imagine when i finished the chapter i flipped through the rest of the book just to see if there was another catelyn heading i didnt want to accept what happened to her by the end of the book the shock had mostly settled but i was still unhappy it wasnt until i finished the epilogue that i felt some sort of justice was happening for the rest of the book is dreary for every stark family member including jon i am excited to see the scene because the sheer shock of it in the books will be all the more real when we see it i wont be happy about seeing it but i feel like it will make the point even more clear that this world is a cruel place"
"the maid of woodlynne",2013-05-13,"i did the same thing  flipping ahead to see if there were any more cat chapters  because i just could not believe what i had just read what stood out for me is the sound of the drums cat repeatedly mentions how awful the musicians are  that was the red flag for me and then when she feels the chainmail under the sleeve  what an awful feeling of dread the other thing i did after looking for the cat chapters was to reread the chapter where they arrive  the twins and finding lord walders mayhaps  that when i was sure i hadnt misread it i did this before i read the arya chapter so hers was an extra gut punch id like to see the moment where dacey mormont realizes something is wrong  the light in her eyes going out and im interested to see lord walders callous indifference towards jinglebell combined with his ghoulish glee  should be enough to properly sicken me"
"Montey14",2013-05-13,"if i remember correctlyrobbs body with the wolfs head wasnt part of the written sceneit was later described by tyrion when they got news of it at kings landing and the gory details came outi had the feeling that something was going to go terribly wrong when the freys admitted to not having their children at the weddingand also roose bolton sweating profusely throughout the wedding hes a type that never sweats or never seems to show any apprehensionas soon as the scene ended and robb was deadit was really a big punch in the guti felt like i couldnt read the story any longerthat some how robb was supposed to continue on and fight the good fight another strange line that stood in my mind was cats reference to her hair when they were coming to slash her throat not my hair ned loves my hair i guess the shock and horror of it all would make her delusional the most troubling part for me was how they treated the bodies afterwardsthe mocking of the tulley funeral traditions with catlyn just being dumped inthe riverand of course robb being mutilated in such a manner after his deathwe know what happens to catbut i was kind of hoping grrm would tell us what finally happend after robbs body was mutilated what ever became of his remains"
"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2013-05-14,"yeah i think my most vivid image what the blade coming out of robbs chest as roose bolton stabs him because i think when i got that that point i got a jolt and my whole body shock for a microsecond as though i touched a live socket or something up until that point i still held out hope that robb will get captured and i didnt expect him to die when the blade came out of his chest it was all over i think after finishing that chapter my heart was beating super fast i had to close the book and take a moment to calm down took me a few hours before i was ready to go back i kept going in my mind wtf did that just happen i really dont expect the show to be able to duplicate that moment robb was a much more awesome character in the books than the show and i like book catelyn a lot more too and all the northern bannermen that i like such as dacey and smalljon arent even in the show i think the show will do a decent job with what they have but they will not come close to the emotional impact of reading the rw edited by the scabbard of the morning 14 may 2013  0108 am"
"The Ghost of Winter",2013-05-14,"when i first read it i had an urge to throw the book then i decided a nice break would be good i put it down for a day honestly when cat dies all ill be thinking of is no dont dont cut my hair ned loves my hair vivid images mostly the musicians holding the crossbows and uh the part where a bunch of men stroll in holding large battle axes i imagine the scene playing out just like the book or at least i hope thats how it goes honestly im not really looking forward to anything it is incredibly depressing to me"
"ktwse",2013-05-14,"1 what were your initial reactions when you first read the scene what are the most vivid mental images you have of iti refused to believe it at first i couldnt imagine i had just read about both robb one of my favorite book characters and catelyn being murdered i felt especially sorry for cat at that time because she died believing that pretty much all her children were dead or lost and also knowing arya was so close i flung the book across the room and then just paced the apartment for about fifteen minutes furious not my hair was probably a standout moment for mei went on to read the arya chapter and then i had to flip the rest of the book to see if there were any more arya chapters there was and that gave me some relief but i was still furious with bolton and frey even until the end of dance manderley talks about how the north remembers well turns out i do as well2how do you think it would have been described from a different point of view than cat<U+0080><U+0099>s or arya<U+0080><U+0099>sthis one is hard to answer for any other lord of the north apart from bolton of course in pretty much the same way from the perspective of frey how justice had finally been made following robbs incredible offense to his house from boltons perspective in a very matter of factly logical way there its done and i now have control over the north3 how do you imagine the scene will play out on screenthe problem for the screenwriters is that there are so many fewer characters we actually know meaning the death of robbs bannermen wont be as striking also the way freys throne room was portrayed in s1 it looks like it will be set in a smaller space probably a lot of focus on robb and cat it will probably be preceded by quite a buildup with lots of ominous signs nonreaders will have to get the sense that something is awfully wrong before it actually happens to be at least somewhat mentally prepared4 how much if at all are you looking forward to the scene can you say whyi cant really say im looking forward to it but at the same time most of the people i discuss the show with havent read the books and in that way i look forward to actually being able to discuss and process it with them"

"Messiah X",2013-05-16,"most of my thoughts on the subject have already been stated but ill add a few things initial reactions and vivid images on my first read i thought holy crap that happened fast not so much that it came totally out of left field i knew something bad was going to happen when the northerners went to the twins well before they even arrived i just didnt expect such a massacre on my second reread all the signs seemed so much more apparent although it was probably in part due to the fact that i knew what was coming however i can honestly say that the first time i paid no mind to the signs the bad musicians separating robb from grey wolf etc i was also so caught up in the massacre that it didnt even register at the time that it was roose who personally slew robb the second reread was more careful and everything seemed so obvious as for vivid images that has pretty much been covered by everyone  the musicians taking up their crossbows the general slaughter of everyone the desecration of the bodies etc but one thing that really always stood out was walders callous sarcasm that line im paraphrasing here heh it looks like ive killed some of your men maybe i should apologize that will make it all better always seemed so cold and smug given the events that were taking place around him as though it didnt even faze him different point of view never really thought about it but i dont think another pov other than robb perhaps could have really shown the horror if the scene were shown from one of the perpetrators it just would have been obvious from the start but it might be interesting to see how some of them dealt with justifying it to themselves on screen i think we will have several scenes of the wedding itself with the massacre itself saved for the last few minutes i dont think they will skimp much on the gore the number of unnamed northerners will probably equal the actual characters from the books but red shirts just dont have the same impact i do think they will put more emphasis on robbs death than the others since the show kind of shifted the catelyn pov to a robb pov other than that i think they will dramatize the beginning of the massacre a bit more instead of everything happening so suddenly rains of castamere will begin playing and well see the shock of the northerners as they are surrounded by armed soldiers before the killing actually begins i am kind of afraid that they will not show the desecration of the bodies what am i looking forward to reactions as everyone else has said in a slightly masochistic way i am looking forward to how they portray it on screen and will probably be eager with anticipation throughout the entire episode but mainly im looking forward to my parents calling me after the show to say oh my god did that just happen i disagree that nonreaders wont be impacted by it maybe they dont care as much about robb the character but there are plenty of readers who consider him the good guy to root for nonreaders who are waiting for robb to avenge his father and defeat joffrey and the evil lannisters in some more cliche narrative way will have their expectations shattered"

"The Carrier of All Plagues",2013-05-16,"i remember on my first read of the book i was looking for the northmen attack to the ironborn and i was reading fast the wedding part i was expecting for some humiliation from walder frey to robb but thats all i was curious for the roose actions when he let jamie free but i was expecting different type of treason later not this so when i read the red wedding i was shocked and had to reread the whole chapter then it stroke me as a certainty and a wonder for the reason of this and for the future of the story the different images started to come when i was reading the events after the wedding the king of the north body with a wolf head is the stronest image so fitting the winter must look similar to this as a sign winter is coming and then the uncat as a tormented spirit of vengeance for the show i quite looking forward for this scene hoping to clarify a lot of future events"

"The Fourth Head",2013-05-17,"what were your initial reactions when you first read the scene i was alerted obviously by grey winds reaction before entering the twins but i felt reassured that due security measures had been taken i was really slow to cotton on to the danger as i was just as convinced about the sacrosanctity of guestright as the northerners were how naieve and i couldnt imagine how anything really bad could happen cat was ahead of me in figuring out the significance of the rains of castamere song i didnt twig that by playing this song it meant that betrayal was looming in that sense i was a total passenger struggling to keep up as events rapidly unfoldedi had to keep taking pauses i was set for a long reading session but i had to stop at the end of the chapter and sit back open mouthed catatonic to reflect and let it all soak in reading arya was like mental torture despite already feeling deeply disturbed when she got hit and i believed her dead i have never reached such a pit of horrified depression in my life discovering what they did to robbs body scarred me i have never read anything that had such a profound effect on me and i was in a bit of a daze for days i felt emotionally numb reading the end of asosaffcadwd the strongest emotion i felt during subsequent books was moral outrage and hate towards the freys which in some ways i guess was the whole point how to transform a well intentioned reader into a joyless bloodthirsty one on the same emotional level as lady stoneheart i hope this isnt the way all the starks are going though if they are im sure grrm will try and get us all on board with them with vengeful icy heartswhat are the most vivid mental images you have of it1 grey winds head on robbs body2 catelyn cutting jinglebells throat to be driven to such an outrageously immoral act was the greatest tragedy for me a reflection of the power of the horror as she was assassinating jinglebells she was assassinating her own morality3 catelyn tearing her face apart4 the upturned table with robb behind it thinking desperately how he could get out of this but not really believing any more that he could5 walders face looking on greedilysurprisingly rooses role made little impression on me bizzarely i think the fact that he was sweating earlier invoked sympathy and the freys were so obviously a target for my loathing due to their gleefultruculent attitude that i had so little hatred to spare the actual swordthroughtheheart moment made little emotional impact for me it was like reading a fact it was almost anticlimatic in the sense that i was already convinced it was over given how deliberately planned it had been by the freys they were hardly going to back out based on cats pleading i also felt it was anticlimatic because it denied ned his justice and denied us the lannister face off i had fully expected although he looked like losing robb could at least have died in a duel with jamie or something instead we have an ignominous betrayal at the hands of a secondary character and apparently fuelled by no emotional antagonismso in that sense the rw was a climatic anticlimaxhow do you think it would have been described from a different point of view than cat<U+0080><U+0099>s or arya<U+0080><U+0099>si think catelyns pov was the best at conveying the horror to view it from walder freys angle would have been deeply insidious robbs would have more sudden and inyourface more central but that pov would have missed other events going on around him jons stabbing from his own pov felt more like shock had it been seen through melisandres eyes it would have more felt like torture catelyns was the most painful pov because we look through the eyes of a mother at her son dying infront of her the powerlessness of it and we witness first hand the emotional impact that has on herhow do you imagine the scene will play out on screenroose was greyer than grey in the books before the rw he was a nobody in my mind the show has made a big deal of boy i think a cutaway reveal scene with boy just prior to the moment things turn in the rw will give fans just enough foreshadowing as the music kicks in and will lmake rooses role far more emotionally poignant im struggling to imagine how they will include the aftermath whether roose and walder will talk after whether they will dwell on the carnege and show the stitching of grey winds head to robbs body its very important but shows like to end on cliffhangers the casting of jinglebells will reshape the scene massively from how it appears in my headhow much if at all are you looking forward to the scene can you say whyi am not looking forward to it in a happy sense but i still cant wait for it to come around why i dont know i have no taste for blood or violence i have no phobia of gore but i find seeing fictional characters suffering just as distressing as most people i am disinterested by mindlessly violent rpg games and i have no sadistic streakso why i guess its largely curiosity perhaps a thirst for dramatic entertainment overriding my distaste for horror by reading such a horrific scene and having to imagine it in my head it made me an active participant perhaps its a form of therapy seeing someone else depict it put it out there for others to get the images unbottled and shared with others there is another aspect which is the whole haha i knew this was coming and you didnt and there is the whole isnt this show so unmissable message it gives out to unconvinced friends that this is why i love it so which is quite macabre and probably paints me in a much worse light than intended a case of vindication with bad side effects never the less there is something thrillingly unexpected and original about the rw which has enormous artistic and creative value regardless of how dark it is it so cool in the sense that it will fearlessly depict events that are so uncool and as such go beyond what we are used to or expect which as a form of intelligent life we are programmed to respond with fascination towards the unexpected towards fresh experiences or fresh thinking as a way of learning how we can improve ourselves or how we can avoid mistakes edited by the fourth head 17 may 2013  0342 am"

"jimmca",2013-05-17,"what were your initial reactions when you first read the scene what are the most vivid mental images you have of itinitially i was shocked there was an oddness to the wedding that made me suspicious but i didnt expect robb and cat to die when it becomes apparent that this is going to be a massacre i had to take breaks in between paragraphs put the book down for a minute so i could pace and wrap my head around what martin was doing it was the most intense experience ive ever had reading my most vivid mental image is simply roose bolton standing over robb putting his sword through robbs heart and telling him jaime lannister sends his regards yeah thats what plenty of people will say but it stuck with me especially because its through poor catelyns eyes that we are viewing the scene also lots of people took a break and i understand but i was kinda the opposite seeing that arya was next i had to immediately know what would happen to her as she approached the twinshow do you think it would have been described from a different point of view than cat<U+0080><U+0099>s or arya<U+0080><U+0099>scats pov was particularly effective aryas chapter was terrific as well im not sure anyone else could have had made the scene any better cat and arya are the only pov characters that were there and that martin had established so it would have taken me a little aback to have robbs first pov as his death scene and a frey or bolton povnahhow do you imagine the scene will play out on screenits gonna be difficult to match the book but i think they may be able to pull it off they have to make the wedding seem odd at first and get the audience a little suspicious get a nice eerie atmosphere going make the band play loud and terrible to make everything uncomfortable once roose bolton initially leaves the table then you bring on the horror specifically focusing on cat and how shes perceiving everythingthe only problem i have with the shows handling of this storyline and maybe this is just me knowing robbs doom is that if i were a show viewer only i would know robb is in serious trouble with the pregnancy and the recent scene of him and talisa talking about how happy they were going to beits all just cues for the discerning viewer that tragedy is about to strike its similar to the handling of jonygritte though one could say that that tragic end was just as apparent in the book as in the showhow much if at all are you looking forward to the scene can you say whyif this is pulled off right and i am optimistic that they will pull it off then it will be the scene of the series its intense emotional shocking hell if depicted right it could even be horrifyingly beautiful im also sadistically excited to see the fallout in terms of fan reactions im ready for it and theyre probably not lol so yeah this should be fun"
"Theda Baratheon",2013-05-17,"the bad musicians was always very very vivid in my head i had this idea of a horrible sounding discordant noisesomething is just not right i shouldnt shake that feeling throughout the whole of the scene before we get to the massacre in the show id like them to really emphasise this horrible atmosphere and to begin this with grey winds reaction catelyn looking very alarmed and worried robb looking anxious and then all pausing for a bit only to reluctantly continue as by guest rights they should not have been able to hurt them the last line ned loves my hair and catelyn clawing her face with blood all over her after seeing roose bolton stab to her her last son really is horrible and resonated with me"
"Theda Baratheon",2013-05-17,"my reaction was sheer horror i had to throw the book to the side as well never because i was going to stop reading all together i knew id continue but because i needed some time to handle exactly what happened i then picked up the book and rushed through all the chapter titles to see if there were any more cat chapters and then i had a big old cry as everyone has already said robb with grey winds head is going to be a horrible horrible but powerful image"
"Daphne23",2013-05-17,"what were your initial reactions when you first read the scene im deeply invested in catelyn as a character and already felt her grief and pain over losing four of her five children when i read the description of robbs death i was so devastated both for her and for the loss of the stark hopes that i put the book down i then had the joy of picking it up again to read the next paragraph and find that catelyn my absolute favourite character was also killed the following arya chapter however made very little impact on me because it seemed obvious from the way her death was described that she was in fact unharmedwhat are the most vivid mental images you have of itwhenever i think of the red wedding i see catelyn standing in front of walder frey who is seated on a throne i know ive added this detail  it must be a chair in the books holding jinglebell hostage and desperately trying to seek a solution before robb is killed i see this as the still moment in the scene before robb is murdered and catelyn loses her mind so its always the scene i see when im trying to visualise it the very end of the scene is unclear to me because catelyn is obviously unable to observe accurately82328232how do you think it would have been described from a different point of view than cat<U+0080><U+0099>s or arya<U+0080><U+0099>s82328232i dont think it would have been half the scene it is if described from any other point of view other than cats i dont really see the arya chapters as part of the red wedding per se so ill leave that out for me cats tragic horror and grief at losing all five of her children is what makes it the scene it is i have often wondered how those who hate cat can experience the same emotional impact reading the scenehow do you imagine the scene will play out on screen82328232im pretty worried for me catelyn has to be the central character of the scene but given adaptation trends so far this seems extremely unlikely especially as talisa will be present her attempted bargain with walder frey is the heart of the scene for me but im not even sure that will happen i imagine there will be much more focus on robb and talisa and less on catelyn i also think it will be much gorier on screen which seems a strange thing to say because its pretty gory in the books but i think the tv series will really play up the gore in the books despite the violence the focus isnt really on graphic descriptions of robb being stabbed through the heart or catelyns throat being cut but more the emotional impact of these events and im worried that the scene will be too gory distracting from the emotionhow much if at all are you looking forward to the scene can you say whyi dont really do gore so i may not watch a lot of it however im still looking forward to finding out how they do adapt it and the reactions of non book readers"
"WardenOfTheNerds",2013-05-17,"as i wrote in another thread the rw surprised me a lot because my imagination was already at moat cailin with robb taking north back flaying theon etc its a nice thing about grrm that most of the shock scenes catch characters in the middle of some other plans which makes it more realistic and catches the reader even more unprepared that being said i never like robbcatelyn that much after the initial surprise i got over it easily some people on the boards were devastated from what ive read biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd "
"Blind Beth the Cat Lady",2013-05-17,"the most standout moments for me were when someone forgot who puts his sword through robbs heart and twisted and the point when cat actually cut jinglebells throat those were both points of no return that i really didnt think were going to happen until they actually happened even as i kept reading part of my brain was looking for a workaround possibility that maybe they hadnt happened after all i dont remember being angry about it just sad and really floored it kind of has this crazy bottomless pit effect because the minute they arrive and grey wind lunges at one of the freys you know something is up and as cat observes little things that are off you become pretty damn sure somthing is going to go down but grrm does a really good job of dropping red herrings that its going to be some kind of gauntletthrowing semispontaneous smackdown between robb and lord frey i was thinking there would be some smallscale violence followed by robb loosing the freys yet again and having to start from scratch but then at the banquet you realize there is a plot afoot soldiers come in the band attacks but robbs men arent too drunk and seem to be holding their own i wasnt sure how theyd fight their way out but i was pretty sure they would dacey goes down sad i liked her robb gets hit with a crossbow bolt or threeno big hes taken arrows before this can still turn around when cat grabbed jinglbell and started negotiating i thought it would work or at least that the freys would take robb and cat prisoner instead of killing them then robb dies what waitwhat no way really reread two or three times to make sure huh yeah hes really dead sadpoor cat loosing another kid well thats that surely now the party is over everyone else will be rounded up and dumped in the dungeon because clearly thats the centerpiece of a scene like this and cat would never reallywoah what cat just actually killed a mentally challenged guy what well now theyll grab her and dungeon her for surewait where did the birds come from oh not really bird clawsyikeshow much further downhill can this even go i think i cried a little at the not my hair ned loves my hair bit but i dont think i really believed cat was dead until arya did via the nymeria dream i definitely thought grey wind got out until i heard about his head and robbwell actually i didnt believe that either until i heard it from a few sources and then got bran confirmation that grey wind was out of the picture how would it have been different from another perspective well i am a big cat fan i dont love everything she does but i do love her character so i think having her perspective made it the worst possible thing i really only cared about robb because cat did and i really thought cat and arya were going to reunite cats perspective was heartbreaking in a way that i dont think another perspective would have been any of robbs bannermen would have been interesting but having a sudden new pov character would have tipped us off that heshe was going to die and a lot of them died before robb everyone else at the wedding knew what was going to happen so it would have been a big spoiler although i think having roslin freys perspective in addition to cats would have been interesting especially if her narration didnt spoil the event because it was all so terrible she couldnt bring herself to think about it her going upstairs hearing the music making love to edmure while trying not to think about downstairs then coming back down to the carnage thinking how much she was coerced and how terrible she feels about all of it especially now that she thinks edmure is a pretty good guythat would have been intense as for how much im looking forward to it and how i think itll be adapted on screenwell i was looking forward to theons onscreen arc a lot but dd have taught me to be careful what i wish for things that are gritty and graphic but within the realm of enjoyability on the page can be really horrible and offputting on the screen thinking about the rw i find myself thinking oh god i hope they dont show that part a lot more than i find myself thinking how dramatic and tragic it will be i guess basically what im hoping for is that it comes across as a tragedy rather than a horror show and i really hope the head switching isnt shown edit when arya was hit in the head my first thought was no way you have go to be kidding me if arya is dead i am out so i skipped ahead for more arya chapters realized she wasnt and kept going edited by smaug the dreadful 17 may 2013  0450 pm"

"TheDarkEye",2013-05-18,"i think this episode should end with thw showing of the rd outcomes after aryas death which i think should be kept in secret reaviling the arya is alive only in the next season so the impact of this episode on the watchers would be priceless by all means they should give us a vast view on the sluaghter in the camps afterwards the weddinghall with al the corpses with robb sitting on a throne high above with greywinds head and the crown i never understood why they never gave robb a crown in the serie and after that they should end it with cats naked body thrown to the river all the while the rains of castamere played in the background"

"tmug",2013-05-18,"for some reason i always pictured the rw being held outdoors because of aryas perspective when she and the hound show up i think that will have more impact on people then cat and robb and co she spent all this time and effort to get back to her family after her fathers beheaded only to get there after everything has happened as interested as i am seeing how cat pulls it off arya should have an even more tragic feeling this is how i see it played out cinematically cat will be uneasy the whole time with the freys blackfish will reinforce those feelings but some reason he wont be at the rw we all know what rains of castamere sounds like at this point that will be the backing music while this whole farce takes off cat tries to leave but is held up she notices the chainmail and then bam she turns around and the freys have talisa at knife point robb is held down as they take her away robb screams screaming for grey wind as well the freys drag in grey winds corspe filled with arrows cat sees this and grabs one of walders wives at knife point cat begs for mercy walder mocks cat and his own wife then cut to a closeup to a pair of boots walking in the place with a soft spoken the lannisters send their regard then we see roose do his thing to robb cat out of anger slits the throat of the wife and then one of walders sons does cat while she sobs over robb i doubt we will see robbs corpse afterwards i like the idea that news about the rw spreads and people will have different recounts of the actual events some will say robb turned into his wolf and tried to murder everyone others will correct them saying they merely sewed the boys wolfs head to his body not sure about talisa and the blackfish i can easily see the blackfish go down in a blaze of glory as well taking out a bunch of freys along the way talisa is the wild card for book readers something to keep us on our toes because we all know how the rw plays out talisa is the person we dont know what will happen to and to keep us watching and talking i would personally like to see her go the way of cat but i think talisa is a wuss roose could end up telling her to attend to all the corpses afterwards that would be so cruel"

"LilJonUmber",2013-05-18,"what were your initial reactions when you first read the scene i had a similar physical reaction to most i threw the book across the room in disgust and utter disbelief this was followed by a bit of pacing around to collect my thoughts but within minutes i retrieved it and reread the chapter to make sure that what just happened did in fact actually happenwhat are the most vivid mental images you have of itthe image of cat realizing that edwyn was rockin the chain mail underneath his garb always stuck out and the gory imagery of her scraping the flesh off of her face which admittedly i didnt grasp upon first read would have to be a close 2ndhow do you think it would have been described from a different point of view than cat<U+0080><U+0099>s or arya<U+0080><U+0099>sit was perfectly chaotic and disturbing as was intended i wouldnt change a thing and dont see how you could with those in attendance of the rwhow do you imagine the scene will play out on screendd have alluded to this scene being the impetus for their quest to adapt asoiaf to television theyve clearly taken every precaution and chopped out many scenes and lines from the show in preparation of it i trust that theyll make it one of the more memorable scenes in the history of television  if not the most memorable but at the very least itll be gruesome and potentially polarizing how much if at all are you looking forward to the scene can you say whysay what you will about robb and cat but theyre good people and in a world devoid of such its going to be gutwrenching to see them suffer such a cruel fate at the hands of such a slimy perverted creep so if anything im looking forward to the reaction of my unsullied friends not so much for my own viewing pleasure although i am somewhat curious to see how the scene stacks up against what id pictured in my minds eye edited by liljonumber 18 may 2013  0158 pm"
"Shadow on the Wall",2013-05-18,"what were your initial reactions when you first read the scene i was expecting something bad to happen but was shocked at the brutality of it i had heard a mention of the term red wedding prior to reading asos but assumed it would happen at the end of the book was sad for catelyn but particularly sad for robb the loss of the northern resistance was also upsetting but at the same time i was incredibly impressed by the writing of the chapters in the book in the next chapter i knew immediately that arya was not dead what are the most vivid mental images you have of itthe most powerful image for me is catelyns throat being cut  and the desolation she has thinking that everyone in her family is dead heartbreaking next most powerful is the man in armour stabbing robb and saying jaime lannister sends his regards i had been suspecting a bolton betrayal but whilst reading the chapter for the first time i didnt make the connection that the man in pink was bolton prior to the wedding ghost getting angry was extremely vivid as was ghost sowed onto robb postred wedding82328232how do you think it would have been described from a different point of view than cat<U+0080><U+0099>s or arya<U+0080><U+0099>s82328232would have been a lot worse the scene through cats eyes was devastating as you realise she has lost her whole family aryas was also a powerful chapter how do you imagine the scene will play out on screen82328232not sure but imagine it will be similar to the books worried they will place emphasis on talisa rather than catelyn dont like talisa in the show and so any time spent with her is time wasted in my bookhow much if at all are you looking forward to the scene can you say whylooking forward to it a lot its a very powerful and sad scene whilst also being the logical culmination of a series of mistakes made by robb catelyn and the north watching it unfold will really make me empathise with the characters also i look forward to seeing nonreader reactions to see if they are like how i felt when i read the books"

"Gendels Children",2013-05-19,"its a very interesting and intense emotional journey one sets out to when reading this particular chapter i my self have a very strong imagination at night i have highly intricate and vivid dreams so reading books from such fantastic writers such as grrm is always an amazing experience as one barely needs to have a great imagination to see this world jump out from the pages and spring to life i think the hardest part of this sequence is the perspective we receive it from cat a strong woman a fiercely loving mother and wife who has witnessed and experienced hardships many people in the real world could barely fathom cat has experienced more trauma fear guilt and anguish then many characters we encounter also she has witnessed her whole family crumble break and die before her very eyes but she must move on with every obstacle thrown her way she becomes heavily emotionally wounded but we see her push through time and time again no mother ever want to out live her children but at this point she believes she has lost at least three of them and her beloved husband murdered in a situation she was unable to prevent or save but she continues on the pain an ever present companion inside her that she can never let out so many times she wants to break down but does not with this wedding we see her pushed over the edge she is taken way past her boiling point and driven into a state of madness from the scene around her she becomes desperate so desperate she uncharacteristically takes the life of an innocent and physically turns her rage and pain on herself savagely clawing at her own face laughing and crying with mass emotionalphysical pain and hysteria its through the eyes of this fractured overwhelmed and utterly grief stricken being that we are being presented these events we are inside her when all this happens and so we feel it too during this moment we are cat we feel her pain and we too desperately want to fix this situation which has gone far out of our control and to big to recoil from then of course there is the aftermath the darkly twisted manor in which they treat the bodies of the slain robbs head being sawn off and discarded then replaced with the head of his murdered direwolf with his crown placed on his head for all those who care to see in a cruel jape against him i find the most haunting part is my vision of what dany saw in the house of the undying the haunting image of the king with the wolfs head to me the sight was a horrifying one a nightmare of sorts very dark and scary then to have the knowledge that this thing was created from the body of a loved character and an equally in my mind loved pet in a sick mockery that is the most emotional part in my opinioni also just want to say grrm is a genius every move he makes through the series is golden yes this was a terrible traumatic chapter but that has a kind of beauty in itself a tragic beauty edited by kissedbyfire 19 may 2013  0431 am"
"Gendels Children",2013-05-19,"also just want to add that after reading the initial scene it was a great move for grrm to have us then relive it again from outside in aryas pov because at this point we know exactly what is happening in there with every line of the song drawing out he know more and more death and carnage is taking place it gives the reader more intense feelings towards aryas attempt to get in there and help save her family because even though she doesnt know exactly what is going on we do"

"Inevittable",2013-05-20,"hi everyonethanks so much for all the responses so far theres a really great range of opinions here i have a few more questions to throw into the mix but am still interested to hear from anyone who hasnt answered the opthere are a few images that keep recurring first is the image of cats descent into madness and the final stroke that slit her throat second is the treatment of the bodies after the massacre why do you think these scenes in particular stand out the music has been mentioned a lot as well i think thats really interesting because its not something visual which is what a lot of people pick up on when reading it should be great to seehear how the music is done on the showalso which of you read this scene after youd started watching the show and which of you read it before watching the showvery much like the atmosphere in cowslips warren in watership down where the residents all know a terrible secret but are keeping it from the newcomersthis is going to be on the same level as the scene from transformers the movie when all of the autobots get wasted anyone else who was 10 years old when that movie came out will know what im talking abouti think its interesting to compare this to the imagery of other things weve seen does anyone else have any other examples"
"AzorAhai42",2013-05-20,"what were your initial reactions when you first read the scene what are the most vivid mental images you have of itthe most vivid mental image for me was roose bolton betraying robb and sticking his sword through his belly and saying jaime lannister sends his regards this single moment was the most powerful for me because at this point in the story i was really starting to like jaime a lot and i also really liked robb of course so that line especially messed with me i knew that had to be one of the worst things for robb to hear as he is dying another really strong thing about the scene in my mind is that it is the culmination of several betrayals against robb stark first we have the betrayal of theon greyjoy i hope the skin scene makes an appearance we have the betrayal of catelyn which the jaime lannister sends his regards makes even more powerful we have the betrayal of the karstarks which forced robb to consider this wedding in the first place then of course the betrayal of frey itll be interesting to see what happens in the show since robbs wife is apparently going to be with him at the wedding and finally the betrayal of bolton arguably the worst because roose becomes a kingslayer and taking into account the rough history between the boltons and the starks not to mention edmures follyslight betrayal of not following robbs orders and costing him tywin lannister how do you think it would have been described from a different point of view than cat<U+0080><U+0099>s or arya<U+0080><U+0099>si think we may have gotten more details if it was described from a different pov the writing makes me think that cat is beginning to lose her mind pretty much after she sees the chain mail under one of the frey men she doesnt even name roose bolton as the one who kills robb she only notices a man dressed in pink because shes starting to lose her mind already even before robb dies perhaps she sees it coming and its just too much for her to bare how do you imagine the scene will play out on screeni imagine it will be done beautifully because this scene in particular was a major reason for d  d wanting to adapt this story into an hbo show i cant wait for it to air how much if at all are you looking forward to the scene can you say whyi am highly anticipating this scene for several reasons the biggest being im tired of trying to hide this major spoiler from my unsullied friends i want to be able to talk about it and all the ramifications of it with those people that havent read the books most of my unsullied friends still hate joffrey more than anyone and i really think that this scene is going to greatly stir the pot another big reason is what i said in the previous answer that d  ds main reason for adapting this series is so that they could do this scene they have said several times that if they were able to make it to season 3 with the show they will have completed the main thing they wanted to do im very excited to see the fruits of their labor but also this scene is a changing point in the series things start to get really dark after this and really still have not begun to brighten up again i think this scene will have a very polarizing effect on show viewers i strongly believe that after the next episode there will be two types of game of thrones fans those that will never stop watchingreadinggetting lost in the song of ice and fire universe and those that will stop watching and never return and hopefully it will be mostly the first group of people"
"gibbles545",2013-05-20,"my main mental image is catelyn getting grabbed by someone who then begins sawing at her hair with a knife while she is crying thinking about how ned loved her hair so yeah pretty depressing really"

"Lady Sunrider",2013-05-20,"i read the chapter before the show was on when i read it i was shocked and horrified it had the same sort of impact as when ned was killed at the end of the first book but even more intense as others have described there was foreshadowing and so reading the chapter i was worried but because it was from cats point of view and she believes she has taken steps to protect them making sure they ate something to invoke guestright i started to think it might be all right maybe an ugly scene of shouting or something then she felt the chainmail and oh no it was so horrifying and more it seemed to me that it showed the way that their society had completely broken down afterwards i like many had to put the book down for a while to catch my breath i felt again as i had after the first book that this was not going to be a comfortable series i had just started to feel that the stories were feeling a little familiar and them the red wedding happened and so anything could happen all bets are off i think that telling it from cats and aryas point of view made it much more harrowing as i have said since youre in cats head you share her expectations of peoples behavior and her knowledge and love for those being slaughtered you are with her as her whole universe is destroyed before her eyes i dont think any other point of view would have that impact i wonder how or if the show will be able to capture that impact the view of the all seeing camera is not as personal i also think that a downside of having theons torture take place on screen during this season may rob the rw of some of its shock and horror we have been seeing pointless sadistic cruelty all season i think the worst that could happen is for it to just be a set piece without the emotional impact in the books the violence and cruelty are horrifying upsetting and repulsive i hope the show doesnt glamorize it not that i think they want to but that it might happen inadvertantly because of the emotional distance allowed by the camera i cant say that im looking forward to it but perhaps that im looking forward to it being over all season i have felt like i am watching the condemmed and i havent been able to say anything my husband is unsullied it will be a relief to be able to be more open about things i hope this helps in your project"

"lostinwesteros",2013-05-23,"for some reason i vividly remember cats description of roose bolton sitting next to her barely talking and picking at his food and the growing bizarre sense of it as people were getting up and leaving and the discovery of mail underneath the serving persons clothes at this point i was still wondering what was going on and then my shock when the attack broke out cats quick instincts and her jumping right into the fight diving in to drag jinglebells out from under the table and her desperation to regain control of the situation in my mind the other fighting was kind of greyed out in the background then grey winds howling in the distance and then the sharp image of robb being stabbed at the other end of the room standing out alone and the horrible realization that he wouldnt get away most vivid of cat then is not her plea about her hair but her dropping to her knees and clawing at her face with arya and the hound what was so vivid to me was that first sight of the festivity in the tents surrounding the castle then the ensuing horror as the tents went up in flames  and that she was gutwrenchingly if thats a word once again robbed of her chance to reunite with her mother even though shed gotten so close this time when the chapter ended with her being hit in the back of the head by the hound i thought she was a goner too edited by lostinwesteros 23 may 2013  1027 am"

"DaveSnow House Stark",2013-05-23,"what were your initial reactions when you first read the scene somewhat anger and surprise grrm did a great job of building up the tension through cat but once they ate i kind of felt better i was pretty shocked at cat being killed also since normally the women are spared what are the most vivid mental images you have of it cat going bat shit crazy and killing the frey the look on robbs face as the blade comes out his chest grey wolfrobb mix how do you think it would have been described from a different point of view than cat<U+0080><U+0099>s or arya<U+0080><U+0099>s not nearly as impactful using cat he was able to convey her fears and emotion the fact that she believed the last of her children was dying before her eyes the only other one couldve been lord frey getting a glimpse in his smarmy rotten head may have been entertaining had he written half the rw using cats pov and then rewritten the same half using lord walder until its bloody conclusion may have been effective how do you imagine the scene will play out on screen hopefully very emotionally thinking it will be a few scenes initially the approach and grey winds distrust cat picking up on it the initial entry and cat basically begging for food her relief once they eat then the final scene when it happens how much if at all are you looking forward to the scene can you say why i will be glad when its over so people will stop trying to spoil it for everyone online you cant see anything about agot without seeing people saying you know they all die right the main thing i am not looking forward to is coming on here and seeing the endless bitching about how they ruined it no matter how well the scene is played out on tv there will be no pleasing the majority on this board i just want to watch it and appreciate it for what it is btw my book throwing moment was when jon snow was stabbed i identified with him from the beginning so his death meant way more than robb and cat"

"Blaer Dayle",2013-05-24,"well ill do my best i only read this scene once because i was attached to the characters who dies and it was too painful to read through again although i likely will after it is on the show just to sort out between the books and show universes the sequence plays out in several key parts in my mind 1 they arrive at the twins and grey wind senses something is wrong catelyn takes notice but thinks it is simply him being the wild animal he is robb disregards it either as the same or trusts that walder will keep his word 2 they enter make small talk and catelyn insists they eat to invoke the guest right walder acts as though it was assumed that they were under his protection to feign confidence of his guests 3 having done that they assume all is well and the marriage gets underway after the marriage they have a feast edmure gets very drunk and is taken to the bedding ceremony meanwhile the rains of castamere is played loudly 4 in the confusion following edmures departure walder signals his men to kill the guests catelyn looks on in disbelief and almost a state of shock by the time she realizes what is happening the best she can do is grab jinglebells and hold him hostage for her own life 5 catelyn kills jinglebells and is in turn killed herself 6 arya later hears about the terrible things done to her family and sees some things through warging what is presumably nymeria when i read it i knew that a wedding was coming with big implications but i assumed it would be joffreys wedding which of course also had large implications for everyone i thought this would be a low key wedding with some bitter feeling from walder but ending with his agreeing to support robb once again when i realized something was wrong starting with grey winds suspicion i hoped that at least robb and cat would make it out alive following the wedding i had to stop reading for the day and entered a sort of minimourning state i realised that the starks greatest hope for justice was gone and began connecting brans visionstywins remarksforeshadowingetc i started the books after the first eason of the show so this was the first huge death for me and it really hit home that george is a cruel and vengeful writer much like the medieval times were as the show approaches the scene i just dont want it to happen even though i know it will dont get me wrong i want to see it as it is my most vivid memory from the books but at the same time i wish it could end differently and its even worse seeing it coming and knowing the outcome however in the show i am slightly less fond of robb who seems less a boy who had authority thrust upon him who made one mistake and more as a selfsure man who does what he wants regardless of how it affects those around him i think the show will have it very frenzied so the viewer doesnt understand what is happening for a moment sounds of the bedding ceremony bleed into screams etc much like cats pov and the rains of castamere will of course feature heavily as they have been foreshadowing it since last season i get the feeling that it will be impossible to capture catelyns range of emotion without excessive dialogue which of course would ruin the scene i cant imagine the scene from any other pov as i feel like it worked most powerfully being from stark povs although i guess it would have been interesting to see the aftermath firsthand maybe walder would make for an interesting pov but then again it might just be one dimensional or insane so it might be a terrible idea the red wedding as of right now is the centerpiece of the series for me that might change depending on the last two books but for now it best shows the deceptive nature of westerosi politics the cruel medieval mindset of the characters the personal angst and despair caused by this plays into the magic of the series via bran and arya and remains an important plot point and memorable and iconic scene nice idea for a phd thesis by the way"

"mystikherb",2013-05-27,"well im looking forward to it since i read it and i dont really know exactly what and how much memorial day means to you americans but for now its clearly my least preferred holiday in your country smilepng classbbcemoticon alt trust me as an american the holiday is pissing me off just because its prolonging the best episode of the seasonmy initial reactions to the scene i had unfortunately been spoiled to robbs death i also knew that the most talked about part of the book was known as the red wedding however here is the sentence a comment on a youtube video yes i learned my lesson that spoiled robbs death for me stannis kills robb and joffreyso i was not exactly expect robb to die at the twins i honestly assumed the rw would be a marriage between stannis and melisandre and that perhaps joffrey and robb would be captured and killed at the weddingwhen i started reading the catelyn chapter that the rw occurred in however i did have a bad feeling i will always remember reading it for the first time because grrm was like a god in his suspenseful writing and he maintained a feeling that something was off while simultaneously not giving away the fact that something big was about to go down then the rains began to be sung and then the drums that was something that stuck with me the whole scene boom doom boom i remember that right as the drums began my heart had begun to beat very quickly and by the time the quarrel went through robbs shoulder had to double take on that sentence to make sure i read it correctly i thought i was about to have a heart attack that was when i knew robb was doomed i knew that this was the rw and that robb would die but then catelyn grabbed jinglebell and i started to get a sinking feeling i did not receive any spoiler to indicate that anything would happen to catelyn i could hear the desperation in her voice when she begged to trade the safety of their sons all the while knowing it would do no good when robb was stabbed and catelyn began sawing at jinglebells throat that image stuck pretty hard as well i started to force myself to try and accept that catelyn was about to die as soon as i braced myself for it she began to claw at her face and then her thoughts of the blood it tickles put her in hysterical laughter that i was not prepared for and i felt numb throughout my body by the time they were slitting her throat my mouth was straight up hanging open i remember needing a moment to process what i just read but im pretty sure the first thing i said aloud to myself was holy fucking shitdont even get me started on the arya chapter after that the axe came down on her head i honestly cant say if i believed it or not deep down what i do know is that i repeated very loudly no no no fuck no no and immediately searched for the next arya chapter in the booki think that theres only one way i think another pov could be nearly effective robbs and i would see it like this robb did not die immediately as the sword went through his chest he lives for a few more moments as he falls to the ground but i think what would make that so haunting would be if the last thing he ever saw was his mother murder jinglebell claw at her face laughing and die horribly as her throat was being slit robbs world faded to black and he was goneas far as how it goes on screen im very hopeful that it is a very powerful if not as powerful as the book what will make it or break it for me is how cat dies if its not as gruesome or shocking and she does not die laughing and clawing at her own face i will be disappointed that they wasted an opportunity to really drive in the horror of it all im looking forward to the scene because i get off to having media move me emotionally and im anxious to see the reactions of my nonreader friends"
"imbenurnot",2013-05-27,"i knew that there was a big event two thirds into the book that grrm had emotional difficulty writing and i knew that it was called the red wedding i had guessed that cat would die but not robb for some reason i remember being very confused about what was happening the first time i was reading it and i had to reread the chapter before i realized yup this is it and its significantly worse than i thought i was very upset about it but not quite throw the book or stop reading upset i think my reaction was less visceral because i knew something was going to happen to vastly outweigh neds execution that may be my only regret about my reading experience of the series i have two very strong images one from cats chapter and one from aryas for cats chapter the image in my head is just walder frey this old shriveled man sitting calmly in his chair which is raised like a throne i dont recall if his seat is described this way but thats how i picture it as every single event happens theres this out of focus walder in the background with a grin on his face saying heh his mockery of robb stands out as cat is threatening jinglebell he sits his head a foot higher than cats due to his chair and he just doesnt give a shit in aryas chapter i see her and the hound outside in the camp at night and things are just about to go down the tents are starting to collapse from the fire im seeing the castle on their side of the river with a huge gate probably my own invention from roughly aryas perspective and i can feel her joy and confusion as she doesnt realize the people coming through the gate are not on her side but she starts sprinting to it anyway shes desperate to see her family and shes so damn close the line which stands out most to me is from cats prior chapter though when walder frey says the red will run its such a beautiful and terrifying part of the sentence im surprised hbo never used it as a soundbite in their trailers edited by imbenurnot 27 may 2013  0720 pm"
"ViennaGirl",2013-05-27,"when i first read catelyns rw pov chapter i wasnt clear what had happened when i finished it probably because i was hoping i was wrong im dreading seeing it on screen and probably wont really watch it carefully  ill look at a magazine or something while its on with the volume down im sure it will be done very ominously on screen with the audience knowing that something horrible is going to happen ive reread the series several times and i always skip these chapters so ive only read them the one time and im not even that attached to robb  its just that something about the betrayal is so horrible especially with edmure and roslin still getting married and spending the night together as this happens edited by viennagirl 27 may 2013  0808 pm"
"wolverine",2013-05-27,"what seems most vivid to me is the look on robbs face when he realizes it is all over for him my initial reaction was a feeling that this cant be really happening like they robb was going to somehow fight his way out of it or live or something other than just die i am really looking forward to nonreaders reaction to the scene on the show though i think the impact will be lessened as robb does not seem to be as endearing on the show as he was in the books"

"white wolfpack",2013-05-29,"i think my reaction was the opposite of everyone else instead of throwing the book or wanting to put it down i could not stop reading and i was reading faster maybe a little too fast because i feel like i missed some stuff the first time through to try to put it into words i feel like i was compelled to read because i wanted to make sense of it i wanted the story to do that for me after the arya scene i needed to find out if maybe she survived i have a 4 book bundled kindle version of the books and its not as easy to flip through as a hard copy or even a single kindle book so looking for future arya chapters wasnt an easy option i think i stayed up until 200 am reading in terms of what stands out its more my own sense of shock than anything some parts of it are a little foggy for instance i know cat killed the fool which is creepy because hes basically wfs special needs grandchild but its not that vivid someone mentions it and i think yeah that happened too also i was a little transfixed by the normal things that kept going on the band keeps playing edmure seems to be enjoying his wedding night etc that aspect of it seemed to have a lot in common with actual disasters but it differs from most book disasters most of the people in my real life are unsullied love that use of the term by the way so im looking forward to the episode because i feel like i know this big secret that they dont and its hard to talk about the show i feel like the books are divided into before and after this event and if i meet someone who is reading you need to determine where they are relative to this event before you talk"

"The Lord of Cinder",2013-05-30,"when rereading the book i felt like a complete moron for not picking up on all the foreshadowing that something was going to go really really wrong this scene shocked me more than any scene in any book ive ever read probably more than any scene in any movie or tvseries ive ever watched i remember thinking when reading that chapter another chapter with not much going on i guess ill finish this one before going to bed the old and the new gods know how wrong i was i was feeling a certain sense of dread when the chapter started to near its end but i did still no imagine anything bad would happen i thought roslin was so sad because well she was married off to some stranger and the part with greywind being all uneasy made me a bit uneasy but not to the point of afraid but the moment that frey pushed dacey mormont away and catelyn felt the chainmail beneath his shirt i knew something wasnt right at all i didnt throw the book away because my brain wasnt able to digest what just had happened i was wondering what the hell had happened and just couldnt understand i had to read the last part to really confirm that robb and catelyn really did die i think the fact that it happened in the middle of the book made it even harder to understand since usually a moment that big is left for the end but then again asos did have a lot of big stuff happening towards the end the things i remember the best are probably the part where catelyn pleads robb to just go before roose kills him and the last part where catelyn loses her mind when catelyn was pleading walder to let robb live and end the slaughter i honestly thought robb and cat would survive and maybe meet their end later in the bookseries the pure horror when roose bolton just stepped forth and killed robb twisted the sword left me breathless and in disbelief and now when robb was dead i thought that they would at least let cat live or that she would at least kill that old bastard frey but no not before rereading the scene did i really understand that the ten ravens were her fingers and that her throat was cut catelyn clawing her face in pure madness and sorrow is an image that will haunt me forever i believe the show will do this scene justice as far as television adaptation goes sure they cant tell it from the viewpoint of the devastated cat but it will still be shocking and all the pure brutality of the scene may cause more sleepless nights than any horror movie ever has i dont think the scene will be as great as in the book but seven hells it will still be haunting"

"Tony Inchpractice",2013-05-31,"how do you imagine the scene will play out on screenafter reading the book i thought about this quite a bit one of the initial ways i thought it could play out on tv would be to have the red wedding going on at the same time as joffrey and margery<U+0080><U+0099>s wedding this is of course not consistent with the book but could work from a dramatic pov the royal wedding feast takes place showing everyone happy and celebrating would be intercut in contrast with the massacre at the red wedding with the rains of castamere possibly the national version but with drums that rise being heard on the soundtrack  the song was played a the royal wedding too you see this was one of my first ideas of how they would do it however im now predicting that the season cliffhanger could be jeffrey<U+0080><U+0099>s poisoning so im now pretty sure they will not go down this route of having simultaneous weddings and the trailer didn<U+0080><U+0099>t suggest the royal wedding taking place in ep 9 plus i think intercutting it with the royal wedding would diminish the significance of the event i now think that most of it will be from cat<U+0080><U+0099>s pov as in the books where she starts to figure out the trap and i think they will intercut it with arya and the hound they may have little hints that things are about to go very badly such as grey wind not liking lothar frey but i think the mood will change most quickly after the bedding ceremony i think the rising drums will be emphasised heavily and that the violence is going to be very very graphic they are using amputees for the scene so expect some nasty stuff i initially had a feeling that talisa would be standing in for dacey mormont which would mean that she will get an axe in the stomach the bit where the doors swing open and the men with axes enter i always thought to be very powerful because it<U+0080><U+0099>s sort of like the gates of hell open however there is this talisa spy theory going around which could stand in for the sybill spicer involvement in the plot that transpires in the books so who knowsthere will be a moment i think where they attempt to get the viewers hopes up when the northmen arrive but of course that will be spun on its head one thing i really really hope they do not do is have blackfish stand in for smalljohn and robb<U+0080><U+0099>s bannermen and have him killed at the rw i don<U+0080><U+0099>t think they will do this but if they do i will be very very pissed <U+0080><U+0093> the bit with blackfish and jaime at the siege of riverrun is just too iconic to be left out i think that it could be cool that when cat has jingle bell or whoever in an attempt to save robb there is a silence and footsteps are suddenly heard which get louder and we see the back of roose bolton as he slowly walks out i can see robb full of arrows falling on his knees grasping at bolton<U+0080><U+0099>s middrift similar to the scene in the series where jaime falls to his knees when he meets bolton at harrenhall bolton will act as if he is helping robb up look at him say the line and then stab him his face will be expressionless as he kills robb cat<U+0080><U+0099>s descent into madness will be the make or break scene they need to make it convincing enough so that the frey<U+0080><U+0099>s can almost justify it as a <U+0080><U+009C>mercy<U+0080><U+009D> killing this was for me more shocking than robb<U+0080><U+0099>s death so i think it cannot be botched by the directorsand i hope as do many other people i have spoken to that the final episode shot will be a scanning across the massacre showing all the nasty details and then rising to show the final image robb with grey wolfs sown on his body looking right at the camera but i also thought that they could start episode 10 with something like daenerys vision in the house of the undying but instead as someones dream where they see the aftermath of the red wedding which would be initially similar to the scene at the start of the series where robb<U+0080><U+0099>s army discover the massacre at harrenhall and eventually discover dead robb suddenly grey wind eyes would look at the person experiencing the dream and they wake up then cut to scenes of people describing the desecration of robb<U+0080><U+0099>s body to stannis joffrey etc in the books theon actually has a very macabre dream about a feast where everyone is dead or wounded i think that would be brilliant to visualise something like this on screen at some pointanyway whatever they do i think it will be unforgettable according to david benioff the rw was a big part of their motivation to adapt the novels for television in the first place so i don<U+0080><U+0099>t think they will botch this"

"Blazing Vortex",2013-05-31,"ive been waiting so long for this one scene  i can barely contain myself i never give anything major away but i tell all my friends and family that this weeks episode is the big episode of the series which has made them all really curious about wtf is going to happen cant wait to see everyones reactionswhat were your initial reactions when you first read the scene what are the most vivid mental images you have of itunfortunately for me i knew about the red wedding before reading it in the book to be honest i had never even heard of asoiaf until season 2 of got was airing my brother let me borrow the dvd set of season 1 and i became hooked and started following the show closely after that during the time between season 2 and 3 i read the books but unfortunately i had been spoiled to a lot of the major events that happened in the books thanks to the wonderful internetfor me though even though i knew the rw was coming the scene still had a huge impact i think the same goes for a lot of people but the two most vivid images of the scene in my head are when cat first discovers the chainmail beneath edwyn freys clothes and cats final moments when she loses her mind theyre kind of like the bookends of all the craziness that happened at the rw so they stick out the most in my mindthe single most vivid image i have though is cat clawing at her face for some reason that has always stuck out to me as like the defining moment of that whole scene i felt it really represented her unbearable grief and her quick descent into insanityhow do you think it would have been described from a different point of view than cat<U+0080><U+0099>s or arya<U+0080><U+0099>sid agree with mostly everyone else  the scene just wouldnt have had the same impact if told from any other perspective cat and arya perfectly depict the emotion behind the scene  it wouldnt have been as emotional from anyone elses povhow do you imagine the scene will play out on screenlike i said before i have a very vivid mental image of this scene  like im sure everyone else does  and while im always hopeful the show will do it justice i know its impossible for it to perfectly match the image in my mind but im okay with that i just really hope dd manage to capture the feel of the scene the right way they need to set the tone early on  not make anything too obvious but make it seem as though something isnt quite rightthere are certain things about the scene that i know need to be changed for castingbudget reasons like certain characters that i know will be excluded  yeah there are a lot of stark bannermen that get slaughtered as well but a lot of them in the book arent given much development anyway so its not like i ever had any real personal attachment to any of them i think just the fact that all these northernmen are getting killed off will be enough for viewers to realize the seriousness of the scene also i dont believe ive heard anything about jinglebell being cast for the show but he could easily be replaced by another nameless freyi just really hope certain things about the scene are depicted in the episode like the bad musicians walder frey sitting on his throne cat finding the chainmail under edwyns or whatever frey they decide to use clothes somebody probably not dacey since shes not in the showmaybe talisa getting axed in the stomach  aside from robb and cats deaths obviously this one in particular stood out to me the most in this scene the boom doom drum when the rest of the music stops cat holding a frey hostage and sawing his neck when robb gets stabbed cat sobbing and clawing at her faceas long as these things are depicted in the scene ill be satisfiedhow much if at all are you looking forward to the scene can you say whynot that im looking forward to robb and cat dying because i enjoy both characters although i have to say robb has been coming across as being really stupid in the show but this scene to me is one of the most memorable scenes in any book ive ever read so of course im looking forward to seeing how it will play out on screeni will also point out that ive seen a lot of people say that catelyn has been so underutilized this season which i will agree with to an extent she has definitely seemed like more of a background character this season which is a shame because casual viewers might be starting to forget about her a bit so the rw scene wont really have the same kind of impactbut at the same time theres not a whole lot that happens in cats chapters that we havent seen already on the show this season a lot of the stuff in her chapters has to do with robb  like when he tells her hes married jeyne westerling and when he beheads karstark and when he negotiates with the freys aside from her time as a prisoner at riverrun and her reaction to her fathers funeral which weve already seen on the show there doesnt seem to be a whole lot of content in asos for cats

"Tyryan Lannister",2013-06-02,"the thing that is most vivid for me isnt even in the books but rather my reaction to the scene it was late at night i finished the scene and literally threw the book across the room and loudly cursed martin for over an hour shouting such things as pardon the language how the fuck could you fucking do that you fucking fuck and oh i see you are trying to just end that storyline so you can simply end it and this is your cop out and a bunch of other things like that finally after well over an hour of cursing martin in that way i picked the book back up placed in on the table and went to bed immediately continuing the reading in the morning from where i left off once i got into feast note started the series after feast but before danceit was a little bit before the tv series began running i came to the realization that martin needed something like the red wedding to happen so that he could officially end the first part of the trilogythat being game of thronesand begin the second part a dance with dragons once i started reading feast and in particular the jaime and cersei chapters it became obvious to me that robb needed to be out of the picture and the realm practically unified for jaimes redemption arc to truly being taking form and for cerseis nixonianselfdestruction arc to begin as well well robbs death and end of that war coupled with joffrey and tywin being out of the picture but still also once dance was released it became even more evident that robb needed to die for the overall plot to move along elsewise certain things such as theons redemption which i deem as being vital to bran connecting with stannis and stannis eventual transformation into the new nights king would not be possible learning after the fact that when writing storm martin wrote the entire book and then went back and wrote the red wedding chapter and that the chapter was according to him the hardest thing hes ever written has also taken a lot of my frustration away as to the unsullied reaction yeah really cant wait to see those people blow a gasket for me personally despite the fact that it is still such a difficult chapter to get through the red wedding has been the scene from this season and really the entire series so far that i have been most looking forward toit depresses me to no end that this is the case but i am very much looking forward to it and i hope that they do it justice and as a side note the writers this season have done a superb job of foreshadowing that something big is going to happen without giving away any of the details just as it is in the book so kudos to them as to talisa i have this feeling that especially since we know she is with child she will be replacing jeyne arya in becoming ramsays wife and that he and roose will become regent of the north in place of lord of the north with the intent being that this is the case until such a time as ramsay gets her with child and does away with the stark babe"
"7V3N",2013-06-02,"what were your initial reactions when you first read the scene what are the most vivid mental images you have of iti knew something was wrong i just didnt know what the mood just felt creepy the most vivid image was roose bolton walking in with his sword then cat cutting the throat on jinglebellshow do you think it would have been described from a different point of view than cat<U+0080><U+0099>s or arya<U+0080><U+0099>si think if it were by someone like the greatjon it would have been more pleasant cat had an eye out and knew something was off i think that the greatjon or edmure would have described it in a much more pleasant way without the grim feelinghow do you imagine the scene will play out on screeni imagine it will be very much like the scene in season one where robert visits winterfell and they have a feast  everyone enjoying their time laughing and joking only this time instead of a mean seriouslooking cersei we will have cat looking cautious and perhaps paranoid i think robb will play the humble king to frey just as the books and edmure will be drunk and laughing without a worryhow much if at all are you looking forward to the scene can you say whyseason 2 made me cautious about coming back to the show this scene was the reason i was going to watch no matter what it was the most emotional moment of my reading and the way grrm wrote it just made you as the reader know something bad was going to happen you just never knew what nor did you expect it would be something like what it wasall in all this scene in the books made me feel completely wrecked almost an out of body experience i had to put the book down and just go do something happy it felt like getting dumped by your girlfriend almost just like your heart was ripped out and you never saw it coming"
"Ravi Seaworth",2013-06-02,"what were your initial reactions when you first read the scene what are the most vivid mental images you have of itunfortunately i read this chapter during a moment of depression in the sense that i was not very happy with some aspects of my life it was late and i was ready to stop reading in order to sleep but when i reached that part i didnt immediately realize what was happen i had to rewind two or three phrases to catch everything that was happening i felt so angered with all the injustice of the scene and the fact that arya could not meet her mother left me frustrated but i continued to read and eventually reached the purple wedding which calmed me down a little bit however from that moment on i always felt depressed when reading an aryas or sansas chapterhow do you think it would have been described from a different point of view than cat<U+0080><U+0099>s or arya<U+0080><U+0099>sit is hard to say i think from the pov of robb the description would not have been so different except more heartbreaking perhapshow do you imagine the scene will play out on screeni expect them to leave a strong impression on the nonreaders almost at the same level as the death of ned stark only more surprising i cannot think of the details since my memory regarding the original events that were described in the books are not so vividhow much if at all are you looking forward to the scene can you say whyin my opinion this scene is asoif in a nutshell it represents the complete destruction of hope in the triumph of honor personified by the starks i am really looking forward to the reaction of the nonreaders which i think will be a measure of quality of the show"
"TheWhiteRabbit",2013-06-02,"initial reaction i was physically sick to my stomach i experienced shock and bewilderment even though i saw it coming i think i experienced this because its terrible to read about how characters i cared for were brutally murdered the most vivid image for me is lord bolton stabbing rob through the back because that image more than any other represented what was happening in that chapter the ultimate betrayal i think it would have been extremely interesting to have seen the pov of lord frey or bolton what exactly was going on through their minds leading up to the massacre did bolton have doubts about what he was about to do probably not i cant even imagine how this will play out on screen the scene will without a doubt be the most challenging at least actingwise of the entire series to adapt from what we know the actors felt completely drained when the scene was over so my expectations are pretty high a lot of people including myself have said they cant wait for this scene to the outsider this probably appears grotesque do so many people really want to see their beloved characters massacred i think not im looking forward to this scene because as stated previously it is so challenging if done right the entire audience will feel heartbroken if done right it will only amplify why people love this showbecause theres nothing else like it on tv what other show could make you feel such extreme emotions this is why im so excited i want to see if the actorsproducers pulled it off if they do it will be a remarkable accomplishment that earns the respect of the masses and ensures the longevity of the series"
"WriterIsComing",2013-06-02,"in a show with so much action violence and intrigue its challenging to see how theyll handle these deaths they must be different just as neds was in season one some deaths simply mean more than the deaths of those who simply lay with lions the red wedding is about the extinguishing of hope the end to any illusion that wealth and power do not conquer all in the world of westeros i see its portrayal as tragic in an abstract sense but with tears in the physical both on the part of robb realizing for his last moments of life that he has failed and on the part of his mother who has also failed to protect her child i see robbs stabbing being the last sound heard in the scene with djawadis stark theme played perhaps on a solo violin a requiem grey winds last howl the sound of catelyns wails and sobs perhaps being the only other sound heard ive dreaded seeing this scene but i expect it to be well done however its portrayed"

"bobbybuilderton",2013-06-02,"actually i think its possible they changed it specifically so that they could keep jaime lannister sends his regards if jaime kept it general and sarcastic it makes it clearer that it was just a joke so when he tells robb that jaime specifically sends it it does multiple things 1 shows ramsay to be a sick bastard like his son 2 lets him troll robb before he kills him 3 lets him troll catelyn by reminding her how much she screwed up making her think its all her fault 4 makes it even clearer to the nonreaders that he is taking jaimes comment out of context and that he was in on it even back when he released jaime"

"Zman1863",2013-06-02,"exactly they probably dont want the people to get the wrong ideas thats all it will annoy some of the more hardcore book purists but it doesnt change much so i dont see the problembtw jamie is actually a darker character than in the books he killed a cousini agree they must think the line will play differently on screen for people who only watch the show the reader has ample evidence that bolton is not to be trusted prior to the rw they also have it clearly spelled out through jaimes pov that he has no inkling of what is about to befall robb without this context its possible that an unsullied viewer will infer something that isnt therepersonally i think they are being a bit too cautious in changing the line even if i understand the reason the scenes between jaime and bolton seemed to convey much of the same dynamics that the book did if a little less explicitly additionally having a line implicating the lannisters in general would seem to be pointless since it will already be obvious to the viewers and catelyn that the lannisters were involved given the title of the episode and the presence of the title song as for the whitewashing discussion the regards line is one example of many where jaimes peers blackwash him if the change whitewashes anyone its bolton that its a lie is pretty much the whole point of its inclusion it would have more of an impact as in the book if it wasnt altered but the altered version can still lead to the same events we know of and have no impact on the as yet unrevealed ones"

"Thelastactionhero",2013-06-04,"i found the cremation scene while well done toe cringing in that regard you cant shove your liege lord around like that in front of his men i dont think that would help edmures authority muchalso in the books it was implied that edmure was not a complete incompetent archer but that he could have missed because he was so emotionalthe bf and edmure scenes in this episode did a lot to make that right especially the interactions with his bride as later in the books they become quite smitten with eachother i believei think that edmure is one of the most decent characters and probably tha most decent noble in the entire series of booksoh yeah dude the archery bit was excruciating to watch the guy just lost his dad and nobody can cut him a fucking break robb laughing at him made it all the worse and thats the thing is that edmures incompotence is part of his character and it actually makes him somewhat endearing hes not a bad guy at all wish they had highlighted that more since they might not bother bringing him back again after this episode depending on how they handle the jaime arci like this talk of blackfish finding cats body though a big deviation but im alright with cutting minor characters if its better thematically for the adaptation edited by thelastactionhero 04 june 2013  1058 am"
"lostinwesteros",2013-06-04," nanaki response 23 above i love that small bladder long life quip thats actually what i think happens though that it becomes clear to him that there are no survivors to rw and itd be pure suicide for him to go back in there the next logical thing would be for him to retreat to rr to defend it as that is the only refuge left for their cause my best guess"
"Eizweix",2013-06-04,"i doubt blackfish will find cats body and even if he would he would probably take her body back to riverrun i doubt blackfish even knows thoros and beric dondarrion and what they do or what kind of powers they have i think he ran away and back to riverrun to defend it there is no point of staying at twins to see what will happen and risk getting caught or killed in books he i supposed to be in riverrun and if there will be no brynden tully in riverrun there will be no scene between him and jaime lannister"
"TyrionsFlagon",2013-06-04,"i had a feeling some of the unsullied might think blackfish had something to do with it he basically has the roose bolton role in the bookexcusing him to urinate before the killing begins i cant blame them for thinking that with the way its portrayed in the episodei have the feeling that unsullied as used above does not refer to danys warriors are forum users using unsullied to describe tv viewers who havent read the books"
"Blackf1sh",2013-06-04,"i can totally see this happening at the start of the final episode with brynden tullyhttpwwwyoutubechvqzpzoh2ifec but on a serious note i was glad that he didnt die at the rw since i hope he will have a bigger role to play in the coming books and if he would die here that would probably crush my hopes of that but since they made the blackfish this sort of thuggish chuck norris boduyguard of robb it was kind of a fail that he was taking a piss when robb needed him most i hope we see the blackfish doing something heroic to save his reputation among viewers as my non reading friends believed he was into the treason"
"I'll pay the iron price",2013-06-04,"perhaps his urintaing break turned into a full on greasy dump break hence his lengthy absence"
"Eizweix",2013-06-04," i hope he will have a bigger role to play in the coming booksactually he does when defending riverrun against the frey siege  conversation with jaime lannister etc tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp for me blackfish is a badass in a good sense if he would be present at the rw killing i bet he would take some freys down tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp  and i doubt he would betray cat"

"Blutrabe",2013-06-04,"i can see these possible scenarios 1 the blackfish is taken captive at the twins and well see greyrobb through his eyes hell play the greatjons role from now on the siege of riverrun is cut from the series its not really that important anyway 2 the blackfish manages to escape and returns to riverrun this one is the truest to the books but rather boring 3 the blackfish manages to escape and teams up with the bwb not sure how that would play out"
"Eizweix",2013-06-04,"well it wasnt but still has a bigger role and he escaped when the castle was surrendered so as you said i think  hope he will have a bigger role in future books offtopis just as i hoped for barristan selmy after 1st season and now he does in books so far tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp "
"Ser Luke.",2013-06-04,"i assume hes still alive im glad because the siege of rivverun was one of the best parts of a feast for crows"
"Envie",2013-06-04,"i can definitely see from the way the scene played out how nonbook readers might suspect blackfish had something to do with the betrayal as he suspiciously vanishes moments before it goes down maybe theyre using that to throw viewers off the trail a bit and drum up more theories personally i think having blackfish join the bwb could work and leave out the siege of riverrun  but that would depend entirely on what grrm had in mind for his characters future that we have no idea about yet because after he swims under the river gate during the siege we hear no more of him in the books correct"

"Ser Wun Wun",2013-06-05,"i think he cuts down the freys who come after him in the privy and then jumps off the bridge into the river to get away"
"Damon_Tor",2013-06-05,"a few scenes before the big event blackfiqh excuses himself and leaves outside to take a pissthen unless im mistaken no more news what can we expect now he may be alive here in the mess fighthing with other northerners for a way to escapepersonaly i hope that we woml see more in season finale something like him an a few conpanions escaping and planing their futureeither that or he just dies which would mean that his storyline in books is overits pretty clear in the novels hes an awesome swimmer he probably killed a few frey saw them kill cat and the bodies of rob and mrs rob through a window or something then killed some more frey then jumped into the river from the top of one of the towers he doesnt surface and is assumed deadlater at riverrun theyre fishing out bodies and weeping about it when out of the river crawls the blackfish very much alive"

"Prince of Dragonstone",2013-06-05,"my guess is that he fought his way out and hightailed it back to riverrun the siege of riverrun is a big part of jaimes storyline numerous jaime povs are devoted to it it shows jaimes distaste at being allied with such a lecherous group as house frey and it shows that he is growing into a capable leader of men who could one day possible rule something beyond a battle campaign in the future its a big maturation point for him"

"Starq",2013-06-02,"id be very disappointed if he doesnt name an heir and have some sort of messenger travel to howland reed it seems like a significant part in the story and it must play a role later in the books howland reed must play a role too theyve eluded to him in the show too when jojen and bran were talking about his friendship with ned and i think jojen said he cried when ned died i think they will kill off talisa i also think shes a spy and isnt pregnant but is tricking robb in to believing she is pregant she is doing this in order to ensure he doesnt name a different heir so that when he dies his lineage will end however i think the freyslannisters will have talisa killed off in order to make sure she isnt pregnant or because they are unaware that she is a spy"

"Zman1863",2013-06-02,"i agree with earlier posters that the fact that robb has an heir on the way doesnt end the need to make contingency plans about his death still i think its a coin toss whether they include any scene where robb discusses contingencies for his death robb needs to plan for his heir dying or not being born at all and he also needs to plan for a regency if his child were to survive but discussion of a regency adds complications that arent there in the book still i suppose it wouldnt add too much to a scene to have robb say i want jon to be king in the north if i die childless and regent for my child if me and my mother both die i could also see them completely omitting the scene and using the pregnancy as an excuse for him not to be dwelling on his own death maybe it would be seen as too much of a giveaway of what is to come in a few minutes for him to be thinking about morbid scenarios like his unborn child wife and mother dying it wouldnt be realistic but i wouldnt be surprised if they did it that way either"

"The Fourth Head",2013-06-04,"talisa being stabbed in the stomach was powerful brutal and horrific but for me the image i found most painful to look at was the blood pouring out of walders wifes slitted throat then topped off by cats it was so sudden and so creepily understated by comparison to talisas fate and so final ok i appreciate the irony of that statementit creeped me out in an insidious way in the sense that taking life can be that simple she looked fine but then blood started pouring out of that thin cut in her neckend of it totally freaked me outi know they were trying to convey that cats life was over in her head anyway but in the books her ravings and screaming made her death feel more of a mercy than it did on the show and my imagination is less visceral too edited by the fourth head 04 june 2013  0811 am"
"GoodGuyA",2013-06-04,"gotta agree with the talisa thing the most horrific part for me was that she might actually live and have to deal with being essentially neutered glad that much wasnt the case and one can not overlook the great use of the cinematic medium double throat slit then credits no music thought there might be rains again but absolutely nothing that is a powerful use of expectation"

"Former Lord of Winterfell",2013-06-04,"talisas death which i think was realistic in terms of what the freys would have done one extra little kick about her death was that there was always that lingering doubt that she perhaps had an ulterior motive and may have been working with the lannisters so the stabbing was shocking not just because of the brutality but because of the realization wow i guess she really was just a woman who loved robb almost made me feel guilty about not liking her before and just michelle fairleys performance of a parent watching the death of her family agonizing"

"Envie",2013-06-06,"its taken me a couple of days to really process how i felt about the scene after the initial shock was over and i actually went back and reread the scene in the book i think i understand both sides of the coin better  from the television creators perspective as well as the devoted book readers however my end opinion is that i felt they really overdid the talisa stuff sure book fans objected to her entirely because she was a made up character that wasnt at all like jeyne westerling in the books  but she essentially followed the same story plot and was the same reason love that robb made the fatal error he made i tolerated it but having them be that over the top affectionate with the baby naming dialogue minutes before shes to be stabbed repeatedly in the belly just seemed too much even for viewers who never read the books and possibly cared about her anyways my chief complaint about it is that it makes robb look even more stupid than he was in the books at least in the books you got the idea he was a smart young man just inexperienced and made a mistake by allowing young love to override better judgement in the show he seems overemotional and continually making stupid impulsive moves one example is that after knowing it was stupid to bring her in the first place he nearly draws his sword right there in freys court while walder was leering and insulting his wife what did he expect would happen if cat hadnt stopped him that was just utterly dumb then fondling her belly and kissing her publicly even after she said no dont do that was also dumb why did they feel the need to take his stupidity over the top robb stark wasnt that ridiculous in the books and it lessens the character even though show viewers seem to love robb far more than book readers do i do realize they chose to have talisajeyne there for dramatic purposes now and as a show creator im sure that was done entirely for the nonbook readers benefit it worked and was utterly devastating but for me it lessened the already gruesome ending for both robb and his mother catelyn by some degree all anyone can talk about is how talisa was brutally stabbed over and over in her baby belly its as if gross horror effects overruled the despicable way the rest of the starks had to die im not cool with that"
"MotherofChickens",2013-06-06,"i thought the episode was good on the wholei cried at any rate i dont like what they did to robbs character in the series especially the latest series and i wish that more weight had been given to the loss of his bannermen and the consequences of that as well my other half hasnt read the books and thinks robb is an idiot the actors that played lord frey bolton and catelyn were all superb arya and the hound were also awesome i didnt much care for talisa but i didnt hate the character although a shame that the westerling subplot is not in it but realise they have to trim for tv and agree her murder was awful i havent watched it again yet couldnt face it the next night and we had a power cut last nightam sure theres alot i missed"
"Lady Ivy",2013-06-06,"my chief complaint about it is that it makes robb look even more stupid than he was in the books at least in the books you got the idea he was a smart young man just inexperienced and made a mistake by allowing young love to override better judgement in the show he seems overemotional and continually making stupid impulsive moves  robb stark wasnt that ridiculous in the books and it lessens the character even though show viewers seem to love robb far more than book readers dooh this is brilliant i hadnt been able to pinpoint what was wrong with this but this is exactly iti must admit i hadnt noticed that robbs wife was a different character until my friend pointed it out i had read the book a while ago and just once the story was basically the same met her in the battlefield fell in love broke a promise to another lord for it but yes book robb is smart book robb was a great leader took after his father did the righthonorable things that had to be done slayed a liege lord by himself won every battle even though he was very young and he left his wife behind not to insult the freys and to try to patch things upmovie robb was not as tactical thats the word i am looking for the good thing with this talisababy murder is that we can stop wondering if we will see nedroberta as the future kingqueen of the north"

"Montey14",2013-06-05," boojam i love the thought that d  d will perhaps continue to follow rickon as i have been really sorry to see bran and rickon neglected in favor of the more sensational characters or scenes especially with the rw behind us i think that viewers will be all the more anxious to see more of the starks that we do have left about the greatjon i really missed having a scene at the rw where he turned over a table and took out several freys before he himself fell  he was one of my favorite characters someone at work an unsullied but she does review movies in her blog so she keeps up with actor happenings told me that the actor who played the greatjon had one of his ears bitten  off but didnt know how and that that was why he left the show i never checked it out and it does sound ludicrous but dunnogif classbbcemoticon altdunno brings up another one of my questions though it may be that the answer to this is provided somewhere in the books and i just missed it but i thought that maege mormont and a small group of others had already set off for howland reeds before the rw so ive always wondered what happened to them if they havent cropped back up in the books though theres no chance theyd show up in the series i dont think and thats the only way i can think that the greatjon would be brought back into play i think therere more important fish to fry for the series given all that happens from here on out in the booksmeage mormont shows up again at deepwood motte to help stannis oust asha and her ironborne from the castle lady meadge is holed up with stannis and ready to fight at winterfellrobett glover is league with manderly and perhaps will have a great role to play in the battle of winterfellim assuming they did make it to the bogs and enlisted the cranogmen to help themperhaps to help disldge moat calin from freybolton controlso yesthe mormonts and glovers are true stark bannermen"
"Montey14",2013-06-05,"it wouldnt surprise me if the show just decides to omit skagos and rickon and osha just hides out with the umbers until davos picks him up itd save them the difficulty of explaining the rather gray area of what skagos is and since we havent been there in the books yet its hard to know what great relevance the island and its people actually have it would also save them the trouble of explaining who wex is and why he knows the starks are alive although to be fair that came out of left field in the books tooi may be wrongbut wasnt neds mother said to be from skagoseventhough we never know who she is perhaps rickon can find some protection there if there are family tieslets face it it wont be easy to hide a little boy traveling around the north with a giant black wolf"

"shiola",2013-06-02,"my unsullied brother knows that there is an event called the red wedding knows its a gamechanger and knows its tomorrow night he typed up a detailed prediction i want to post it here for you all to ponder over since the predictions thread from episode 8 is kind of dead now and you might get a kick out of itunder spoiler tags for length spoiler keep in mind all i know about the red wedding is that it is the definitive gamechanging moment of the series and that it happens tomorrowthe wedding is clearly joffreys and margaerys there has been so much stuff setting that one up as being the red wedding that tyrion quote about it will be quite a wedding in episode 6 and its also been built up so much so if you were like watching the series not knowing there was a red wedding then this one is the perfect wedding to have be that one since they constantly hype up joffrey and margaerys wedding its supposed to be the huge wedding and it will be but not in the way that is expected im 100 on it being that onei know i told you yesterday that i thought for sure margaery is going to be responsible for joffreys death in some way and i stand by it there are two scenes that to me clearly show that in episode four i think four theres that scene where granny tyrell is talking to cersei and one of them comments on how their sons seem determined to lead themselves into the grave right after that in the same scene margaery leads joffrey up to wave to a crowd and the music is so ominous like the entire scene is shot in such a way that it looks like something awful is about to happen with cersei coming at the two of them and being like no and just the freaking music i mean listen to it margaery is leading joffrey to his deaththen theres also that scene with the crossbow maybe in episode three where joffrey is cleaning it off and margaery holds it and it shows the two of them looking into a mirror when i first reached that scene i honestly thought she was about to kill him  but now rewatching it i can see that its setting up her killing him later with the way shes pointing it at the mirror it looks like she is aiming it at him and then she has a line where she says do you want to see me kill something thats why i thought she was going to kill him when i first reached that scene and she will just not yet she and her grandma also seemed very unconcerned about the fact that joffrey was a monster to sansa youd think margaery would care about that if she were planning on spending the rest of her life with him but she didnt because shes notso im definitely sold on margaery kills joffrey i dont know the specifics i think she could personally kill him or i think she will incite a crowd to kill joffrey either way i think it will bite her in the ass and she will die though maybe not next episode this goes perfectly with bronns line to tyrion about how if you try to spend all your time being wellliked or whatever youll be the most popular dead man there isadditionally i believe granny tyrell will die she has delivered two lines that also really serve to set up that wedding as the red wedding telling tyrion that people need distractions and that wo the wedding their distraction would consist of tearing us to pieces and in episode six she told tywin that some people would be mad enough to raise swords against both tyrells and lannisters her getting both of those lines has not gone unnotticed by mealso i think  shocker  tyrion will die even though he seems like a character who wont die he got that line about how itll be quite a wedding and hes the most popular character so most popular dead man could definitely be alluding to thatand to finish it up ill go out on a limb and say that tywin is going to die cant for the life of me remember what it was but something in the scene where granny tyrell snaps his quill was said that made me think he is definitely going to die additionally when cersei talked to margaery about rains of castemere the obvious meaning is margaery is being too ambitious and its going to fuck her over since that is what cersei was saying but in reality i think it was going to say that the lannisters are too ambitious which obviously falls most heavily on tywin that scene where he says his plans for sansa and loras to marry tyrion and cersei is like the definition of overambition because he thinks that if he does that hen he holds the key to the north has the tyrells under total control he basically thinks that he is at the top of the ladder totally invincible which in a practical sense he is but i think that thats the perfect time for him to take a fall and with that and the death of tyrion and maybe the death of cersei  margaery wants to be the queen the lannister house will fall just like the house in rains of castemere did so its ironic because cersei was trying to say margaery u fukin urself over but really she was just describing what her own fate is going to beso yeah margaery is either going to kill joffrey and then a crowd revolt breaks out or margaery is going to try and incite a crowd to kill joffrey i have in my mind a badass fantasized scene wherein theres a crowd of admirers and then margaery gives this huge speech about how joffrey is a total stupid shithead who didnt defend blackwater at all and then she tells the crowd to take up arms and kill him  this is just something i think would be cool rather than a prediction necessarily but then it backfires because crowds are hard to control  either way well be getting margaery being responsible for the death of joffrey and then a crowd revolt happens i acknowledge the possibility that there is just a crowd revolt and margaery doesnt do anything badintentioned and simply led joffrey to his death unintentionally which is what that scene symbolized but her want to see me kill something line makes me tihnk that that wont happen but it could during which granny tyrell definitely dies tywin probably dies tyrion probably dies and i would not be surprised if cersei or margaery die and with that many lannister casualties and potentially tyrell casualties its a huge gamechanger because then nobody is on power the door is opened and depending on whether youre littlefinger or varys we are left with nothing but either a chaotic ladder or an empty pit edited by

"King Tommen",2013-05-21,"based on what weve been shown from the promo heres my best guess of how queenscrown will go on the way there the wildlings will see a nw man and want to kill him jon will object tormund will tell him that killing crows is what they do ygritte will try and peg the nw guy off with an arrow and jon will bump her at the last second the man will continue on unaware or maybe orell or tormund will kill him theyll be pissed and mistrustful of jon so once they get to queenscrown and find the old man theyll tell jon to kill him to prove himself jon wont go through with it summerbran will show up to cause chaos jon will decide to bolt and hell get in the altercation with orell and have the eagle attack him which gives him the scars on his face jon will kill orell and im guessing ygritte will also wound him with an arrow on his escape too just like in the books on brans side we see that rickon is with him inside the tower in one of the promo shots so osharickon have not split yet however they do include the scene of osha swearing that she wont go back across the wall in the recap so it may be that after the chaos they do get separated or she decides to say fuck it and take off with rickon afterwards bran definitely wargs into summer which is him discovering a new gift as it states in the episode synopsis"

"kevin1989",2013-05-22,"i think the battle at the wall will be delayed until later in s4 there is an audition clip circulated on wic for s4 which is for styr magnar of thenn who i kind of assumed had just been cut since he wasnt introduced this season going over the wall with jon by the dialogue in the audition tape hes talking to tormund and ygritte and its addressing the fact that they got screwed over by jon and that orell had been killed then they talk about regrouping and attacking castle black so im guessing that theyll start s4 with the wildlings meeting up with another group of reinforcements and working on an attack for later when dd talked about the battle at the wall in s4 they said it would be near the end of the season and more expensive and on a bigger scale than blackwater i think the whole conflict between the wildlings and the nw at the wall including the attack from the wildlings from the south where ygritte dies as well as the ongoing siege from mances forces afterwards will be spread out over a number of episodes until stannis arrival near the climax of the seasonas for bran i imagine that he wont get a ton of screen time in s4 and theyll probably dig into his adwd material and put him on the road to the three eyed raven i could certainly see them doing the same thing they did with jaime in s2 and have him appear in only like 23 episodesyes i hope the same as this season one episode where he meets with coldhands one episode to explain who coldhands is an episode where hes attack by wights or something then the season can end with bran meeting with the 3eyed raven or even extremer let that wait for season 5 and let season 4 be about being a warg and the dreams about the battle thats nice but i mean in the books sam just arived at the wall just after stannis saved the day that means that they need to think about something for sam before ariving at the wall or he is present at the battle"

"King in the North Carolina",2013-05-23,"i agree pretty well on the time devoted to the rw in terms of the episode structure i could see them treating the episode in a very similar manner to their regular structure with flipping through the various stories as per usual including the prerw stuff with robb and cat and arriving at the twins and then around the 34 hour mark well hit the rw and stay there for the remainder of the episode ive seen this done on other shows six feet under comes to mind when there is a big important event they want to shock you with and its a very effective techniquethe audience is used to a certain kind of rhythm with their episodes whether its consciously or subconsciously when you have alternating storylines you visit 5 minutes here and then 5 minutes there rinse and repeat you can lull them into this rhythm for a larger chunk of the episode but when you arrive on robbs story and then dont break away as you normally would it creates even more tension as you are almost subconsciously unnerving the audience by not continuing with the rhythm youve set up for them it doubles up on whatever tension and suspense youve got building in the scene as it standshaving an entire episode dedicated to the rw sounds good in theory but in practice theres not enough material to last an episode and youd ruin the suspense this technique will be far more effective trust methis makes a lot of sense to me balances the need to devote screentime to one of the storys biggest events with the need to not telegraph whats coming and i agree that changes to the usual pacing can help create feelings of tension and unease"

"Dysun",2013-05-30,"i disagree with the notion that affc is going to be cut apart i actually see it the opposite way all theyve done with the lannisters vs olennamargaery is just to build up that relationship once tywin bites it and cersei is regent i expect that part of affc to make up a large part of the show going forward some of the extraneous travels of briennesam will be abridged and altered im sure but the kingsmoot and dorne machinations are actually better suited for tv than books its easier to adjust to a new set of characters on screen than in prose"

"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2013-06-02,"i have wanted to address the they havent built up the northern bannermen so the rw will not be emotional enough complaint for awhile so ill do it nowfirst off the northern bannermen of any note that die at the rw are in order the smalljon dacey mormont and i suppose wendel manderly the greatjon is technically there but not involved at all in the massacre and is only mentioned well after the fact plus he doesnt die he just gets capturedin terms of the 3 bannermen mentioned my memory might be hazy but i dont believe any of them had been built up in the books prior to the rw to any significant degree i dont even think any of them had any lines in the books before they got to the wedding maybe a stray one here or there who knows im pretty sure the smalljon never uttered a word throughout his brief time in the book universe the only reason that readers remember these individuals is because of the way they went out at the rw and cats descriptions of their actions and deaths the greatjon is really the only bannerman outside of roose and karstark who has a distinct personality and readers should have any ties to coming into that chapter this is probably why when adaptation decisions were made back in s1 the bannerman they decided to consolidate most of them into was greatjon the right decision they of course got screwed over by this once clive mantle couldnt commit again which was unfortunate but no use crying over split milk nowi think what weve seen this season to compensate for the loss of the greatjon is the conscious decision to give some of his characteristics and actions to the blackfish you can see see that blackfish is much gruffer and more aggressive than his book counterpart and he even is the one who belts karstark when he insults robb which is what the greatjon did in the booksso my guess is that as it appears the blackfish barring a last minute change of direction will be attending the rw the reason will be that he will be playing the greatjon role i could see him being restrained and subdued by multiple freys during the chaos maybe they even include the plotpoint where the freys try to get him hammered because they know hes the fiercest warrior of robbs crew you can make this change because it adheres to the greatjon fate in the books but because you dont kill him you can write him back into the story later on he escapes when they are escorting him back to riverrun as a prisoner or something like that not very hard to do i assume the blackfish still has a semiimportant role to play later in the story so you wont upset that plotpoint if you have him captured as the greatjon wasdaceys death is memorable but i think its mainly because shes a woman and she cries out for mercy before getting the axe and doesnt receive any but if theyre bringing talisa to the rw and i now think that the most likely of the scenarios is that she dies then she can certainly fulfill the same function and putting aside some of the snide insults of the bookreaders robbs pregnant bride is a more sympathetic character than an underdeveloped dacey is and so that death and that of robbs unborn child should be more dramatic knowing that we have the scene of cat slapping someone a frey i would assume as in the books i think they could certainly be using the dacey sequence of events which starts the massacre with talisa instead to me thats a good substitution in sacrificing a character who the audience is very familiar withwe know they have cast wendel manderly which means hes not just an extra and will have a speaking part if i had to guess id imagine theyd introduce him as they arrive at the twins as robbs kind of personal guard a jory cassel if you will i could see him providing some kind of heroic gesture like smalljon flipping the table over robb to shield him from the arrows or sacrifice himself somehow in any case hell die him being a manderly will be important as well eventually be introduced to wyman who will play a larger pun intended role and this will help address his motivation for revenge on the freysboltonsto me i dont think this particular complaint about the bannermen is as big of a deal as its being made out to be clearly the show hasnt talked about these characters but if they arent going to be specialized and play a unique role its hard to justify including them just so they can be consistent with the books i think the fans should set this aside and understand that the rw is almost exclusively about the demise of robb and cat and that should be the overwhelming focus this is especially true on the show because they are never going to highlight the other minor northern houses to the extent the books do so the fates of the men attached to those houses is not really important in this venueyou have completely missed the point of those bannerman what they are is representative of the norths allegiance to robb in the books the northern lords with rare exception like ricard karstark were fiercely loyal to robb more than that they were proud of him proud to call him their king and would follow him anywhere because they believed in him and his cause smalljon dacey etc were just examples of them it gave the reader hope that robb and his forces could overcome their daunting odds because he was a superior battle commander with the most loyal army the reason why the rw was so devastating is because not only was robb killed so were most of these fiercely loyal bannermanin the show robb lost half of his man when the karstarks left and of the remain 12 some are loyal to bolton so basically robb has a puny force now and has no loyal lords from the north that the audience can identify most of the tv audience have him pegged as doomed its not a matter of if but when to many of them for robb to die so the shock of the rw is mostly gone for them and the emotional sense of betrayal is gone because the show has it set up as the north revolting against robb and the starks when in the books it was bolton and frey betraying the entire norththe show producers will come up with a very dramatic and emotional scene im sure for the rw but it will pale in comparison to the books because they have failed to set it up correctly they wasted too much time in kl this season and did not spend nearly enough time with robbcatelyn and his campaign in the riverlands this season 3 culminating in the rw is supposed to be heavily focused on robbcatlelyn season 4 is supposed to be heavily focused on kl as thats where most of the action in the 2nd half of asos takes place but they are so in love with the lannisterstyrells and they have completely failed to develop a proper arc for the rw and spend most of season 3 away from that plot linesomebody counted and catelyn has had fewer lines of dialogue this season than bronn bronn for crying out loud how can the rw be the climactic event of this season when robb and cat has had fewer scenes than margaery tyrell and bronn can you imagine baelor being a climatic episode of season 1 if we had barely seen ned all season longi guarantee you that most of the tv reaction tomorrow is going to be it was brutal but not quite on the same level as neds death in season 1 where as most of the book readers were hit far harder by the rw than neds death edited by the scabbard of the

"Honourable Ser",2013-06-02,"i have wanted to address the they havent built up the northern bannermen so the rw will not be emotional enough complaint for awhile so ill do it nowfirst off the northern bannermen of any note that die at the rw are in order the smalljon dacey mormont and i suppose wendel manderly the greatjon is technically there but not involved at all in the massacre and is only mentioned well after the fact plus he doesnt die he just gets capturedin terms of the 3 bannermen mentioned my memory might be hazy but i dont believe any of them had been built up in the books prior to the rw to any significant degree i dont even think any of them had any lines in the books before they got to the wedding maybe a stray one here or there who knows im pretty sure the smalljon never uttered a word throughout his brief time in the book universe the only reason that readers remember these individuals is because of the way they went out at the rw and cats descriptions of their actions and deaths the greatjon is really the only bannerman outside of roose and karstark who has a distinct personality and readers should have any ties to coming into that chapter this is probably why when adaptation decisions were made back in s1 the bannerman they decided to consolidate most of them into was greatjon the right decision they of course got screwed over by this once clive mantle couldnt commit again which was unfortunate but no use crying over split milk nowi think what weve seen this season to compensate for the loss of the greatjon is the conscious decision to give some of his characteristics and actions to the blackfish you can see see that blackfish is much gruffer and more aggressive than his book counterpart and he even is the one who belts karstark when he insults robb which is what the greatjon did in the booksso my guess is that as it appears the blackfish barring a last minute change of direction will be attending the rw the reason will be that he will be playing the greatjon role i could see him being restrained and subdued by multiple freys during the chaos maybe they even include the plotpoint where the freys try to get him hammered because they know hes the fiercest warrior of robbs crew you can make this change because it adheres to the greatjon fate in the books but because you dont kill him you can write him back into the story later on he escapes when they are escorting him back to riverrun as a prisoner or something like that not very hard to do i assume the blackfish still has a semiimportant role to play later in the story so you wont upset that plotpoint if you have him captured as the greatjon wasdaceys death is memorable but i think its mainly because shes a woman and she cries out for mercy before getting the axe and doesnt receive any but if theyre bringing talisa to the rw and i now think that the most likely of the scenarios is that she dies then she can certainly fulfill the same function and putting aside some of the snide insults of the bookreaders robbs pregnant bride is a more sympathetic character than an underdeveloped dacey is and so that death and that of robbs unborn child should be more dramatic knowing that we have the scene of cat slapping someone a frey i would assume as in the books i think they could certainly be using the dacey sequence of events which starts the massacre with talisa instead to me thats a good substitution in sacrificing a character who the audience is very familiar withwe know they have cast wendel manderly which means hes not just an extra and will have a speaking part if i had to guess id imagine theyd introduce him as they arrive at the twins as robbs kind of personal guard a jory cassel if you will i could see him providing some kind of heroic gesture like smalljon flipping the table over robb to shield him from the arrows or sacrifice himself somehow in any case hell die him being a manderly will be important as well eventually be introduced to wyman who will play a larger pun intended role and this will help address his motivation for revenge on the freysboltonsto me i dont think this particular complaint about the bannermen is as big of a deal as its being made out to be clearly the show hasnt talked about these characters but if they arent going to be specialized and play a unique role its hard to justify including them just so they can be consistent with the books i think the fans should set this aside and understand that the rw is almost exclusively about the demise of robb and cat and that should be the overwhelming focus this is especially true on the show because they are never going to highlight the other minor northern houses to the extent the books do so the fates of the men attached to those houses is not really important in this venue great post completely agree with you"

"mystikherb",2013-06-02,"i dont think the rw will have quite the same impact as neds beheading ned was the main protagonist catelyn and robb dont carry the same weight also sean bean was an actor that was loved by fantasy fans due to a previous roleyoure right they dont really carry the same weight that nedsean bean did and i dont think it will have the same impact either but i dont think it will necessarily have less of an impact true by this point tv fans know that there are no single stars in this show so a big character death will be less shocking but keep in mind that book readers went through the same thing and most book readers cringe more from hearing the phrase red wedding than from hearing about ned dying its a completely different kind of scene from neds death and is made effective for entirely different reasons ned was a huge character who didnt deserve to die and had a very sad and effective execution in front of everyone however with the red wedding its not just a character death or two or a couple thousand that were facing this is the utter decimation and defeat of the north and that is something no one who hasnt read the books is expecting to see so soon that on top of catelyn watching her last child die before her eyes then lose it herself and die in her own personal hell is way worse than neds beheading i think that there will be different reactions but just wait we will definitely see some unsullied lose their shit over this  edited by mystikherb 02 june 2013  0616 am"
"Mikaele",2013-06-02,"todays the day of reckoning agree with everyone saying the impact and reaction to the rw wont be as intense as ned or even anywhere near we anticipate first season ned dominated screen time and while there arent any single star i dont think robb and cat have gotten enough screen time to give them the proper emotional impact the rw deserves nonboook readers will be shocked upset and amazed at what happens tonightill be devestated for having to relive the whole damn thing i have been talking robb up for a long ass time now just to get people to be more invested in him i mean the kids neds son leader of the starks and the king in the north hes pretty awesome based on that alone"

"The Lord of Cinder",2013-06-02,"i dont know what all you others were thinking but when i read asos i didnt really care that much about cat or robb i liked them though i grew bored of cats long conversations with her dying father i wasnt thinking so much about them when reading that book and when i started on the red wedding chapter i thought it was another normal cat chapter with not much going on for me the fact that not much did happen to robb and cat before the rw made it even worse because i was expecting robb to do some really awesome stuff towards the end of the book i dont believe the rw will be any less horrible for the unsullied because as i said i didnt care much for them in the book but the entire scene still haunts me in my dreams and they werent close to being my favorites i still liked them the circumstances the deaths the slaughter the end of a rebellion the brutality the sheer darkness the madness the sorrow the horror the brutal murder of hope and justice the betrayals the knowledge that robb will never get to avenge his father the rains and much more is what makes the rw something that will be remembered at least imo"

"The Monkey",2013-05-09,"i really dont think jeyne is pregnant in the book we already got four potential stark heirs jon snow sansa bran  rickon in the game we dont need a fifth killing off talisa would be the easy way but i quite like the notion of her being made a hostage and being ransomed to her family in volantis returning there and then possibly interacting with tyrion and jorah mormont come season 6"
"Zorpack",2013-05-09,"speaking of talisa when robb and her gets married they say the vows of the old gods i think that is weird since robb worshipped the old gods in the north like his father and talisa claims to be ignorant of westorosi customs did i miss something that suggests that robb follows the faith of the seven like his mother or that talisa wants her marriage recognized by the seven if not i find that verrrryyy interesting and weird and even maybe a mistake"

"Greyjoy67",2013-05-09,"i think its 75 likely that she will be killed at the rw and 25 likely that she will be captured ransomed back to her family and get looped back into the story when other characters start heading for volantis im kind of hoping for the less likely scenario because then at least there will be some earthly point in her existenceas opposed to jeyne who has no personality in the book whatsoever whilst i dont always like the way they do it in these things i can see why they would recycle characters in the tv show"
"Khal Porno",2013-05-09,"25 likely that she will be captured ransomed back to her family and get looped back into the story when other characters start heading for volantisthis has been my suspicion for a while now i think its possible she could be intended to be combined with a volantene character we havent met yet that will be in winds of winterof course i could be wrong but i hope she doesnt die at the red wedding edited by the duke of jtown 09 may 2013  0910 pm"

"Lord Bored",2013-05-10,"i think its possible d and d will merge her with jeyne poole roose figures he can use her now as access to winterfell ala arya so he takes her hostage during the rw brings her back to the dreadfort ramsay tortures her she befriends theon while theyre planning for the marriage pact etc this way too we can further explore her character and let oona chaplin further show off her acting chops shes very promising as an actress but hasnt been utilized like at all"
"Trinket2",2013-05-11,"i definitely dont believe in the traitortheory i think that shell either replace jeyne westerling and not attend the rwescape and well later find out that shes pregnant or that shell get captured and replace jeyne poole as ramsays bride meaning theon rescues her at winterfell in the adwdseason i would prefer to see her killed though dont like her at all"

"Heir to the North",2013-05-12,"im hoping we get the cold merciless massacre and slaughter and not some glorious fight scenelast stand i cant remember why but i think some scene from a trailer back before the season started gave me an impression this might happen but since then i think it was really from karstarks execution scene i really cant understand the missing grey wind from this episode though really wtf i already didnt like the missing greatjon dacey mormont and other north bannerman good to see that there is a manderly still there at least maybe there will be a scene where robb states hes taking x y z a b and c lords with him dunnogif classbbcemoticon altdunno  so it isnt just a bunch of nameless bannerman he dies with sorry for the rant just getting more and more dissapointed with this scene that dd wanted to be true to or whatever the line they said in regards to the red wedding as far as talisa is concerned 1 i wouldnt mind her being a spy as long as she still died with them seems something tywin would do lol as long as she doesnt replace roose killing robb i will be fine with her dying spy or not 2 if she is captured i could see her becoming jeyne poole and fake arya but i think the other idea of ransoming her and further interaction with other characters in volantis is more likely 3 if she is preggers and gets out with the blackfish i think this is the best outcome for her character and would at least give jeyne westerling a reason to not be just the biggestreason for robbs demise dons flamesuit"

"Lisbeth Sand",2013-05-19,"i think that talisa will be killed at the rw also unless they do a plot twist with herthe last episode reveals her to be pregnant so unless she has a tragic miscarriage having an heir to robb running around would deviate pretty hard from the booksor shes lying to him which i wouldnt discount"

"johnintensive",2013-05-20,"talisa probably wont die at the red wedding why the blackfish needs to be alive for jaime to meet later if the events of the fifth book are followed that closely in addition talisa gives tyrion and jorah a familiar face to speak to in volantis there is no reason for blackfish to leave his king as he goes to attend his uncles wedding unless talisa suddenly falls ill or robb decides that her honor is best preserved if he were to attend alone if talisa cant be there it makes sense for robb to send her home with someone he trusts for his loyalty and his competence  in this case blackfish personally i think that the most horrible thing would be to capture talisa forcefeed her an abortifacient and kill her unborn child while holding her for ransom but thats just me"
"YTDN",2013-05-20,"the current theory is that blackfish will be sent back with robbs will once they find out about sansas wedding since talisa is confirmed to be at the wedding"

"'96Buck",2013-05-21,"be prepared to be disappointed im guessing thenits my opinion that some people put way too much emphasis on this plot point all the crap that happens to jon in adwd with him getting stabbed to death and possibly warging into ghost suggests to me that jons path is probably not setting him up as lord of winterfell i tend to think the will moment wasnt nearly as important as it seemed at the time and was either a red herring by martin or something he changed his mind on after a decade or so like how he lost interest in the who sent the assassin to kill bran mystery even if jon being legitimized is a plot point later thats something that can easily be written around hell even in the books you have stannis having the authority to offer up the lord of winterfell to jon so clearly a decree by robb is in no way essential to this taking placeto address the other point i think weve established well enough why cat wouldnt want jon at winterfell you dont need much of that other background which is fairly superfluous and unnecessary infofans get upset over the weirdest things with this series to me all a scene with robb changing his will to include jon would accomplish is put a massive neon flashing sign above his head saying about to die very soonagree its not like the lannisters or boltons would be at all inclined to give effect to the will of an attainted traitor to the detriment of their respective schemings a prevailing king stannis obviously does not believe he needs robbs permission to seat jon there prevailing targaryen kingqueenboth would certainly not be bound by it they view ned as a traitor anyway and they will install whoever best serves their ability to stablize the realm it appears to me that the entire effect of the will is to drive the one conversation in which it occurs then whatever happened with it its moot"
"'96Buck",2013-05-21,"first of all the will wouldnt make him lord of winterfell it would make him king of the north ya id say theres a big difference there second of all again theres a huge difference between stannis and robb when stannis offered to legitimize jon it was to simply be lord of winterfell which jon rejected because among many other reasons stannis was not a stark so jon didnt feel worthy of the offer and stannis wanted jon to forsake his northern gods robbs situation would be entirely different do to the fact that robb is his own flesh and blood and would be naming him king not lordif you honestly think that robbs will wont come into play at all in the books then maybe you should do some re reads also i caution you think long and hard before you label what fans get upset over as weird as theyre are numerous threads on this forum about the subject of robbs will and its future relating to jon that have numerous members that have been on here a lot longer than you or i that would love to tell you otherwiseit would make him both hed inherit all of robbs titles as robbs heir"

"Khal-a-bunga",2013-05-23,"yeah the spy theory is just that not said i have no idea what theyll do with talisa but of all the options her being a spy would be the absolute worst its baffling that some people think this development would save her character simply because they arent a fan of how this particular story line has been adapted ive made no attempt to hide my complete apathy for jeyne westerling  as a character obviously  and have also made no attempt to hide that i think talisa is an improvement over her book counterpart and honestly shes had a lot of nice moments this season so im still happy with how shes worked out im hoping she survives the red wedding personally that seems like a more interesting route to take than her being killed at the wedding and if catelyn kills talisa instead of some random frey as some have been proposing im not going to be a happy camper especially since the revelation that shes pregnant could lead to some interesting story moments down the road but then again i also want to see robb legitimize jon snow i guess the two arent mutually exclusive and its a little late in the game for robb to be naming heirs although it could be a reverse psychology kind of thing but well see how it plays out in any case talisa being a spy makes no sense"

"King Tommen",2013-05-24,"confirmation on this actually the idea that her family played her to secure higher standing in the game of thrones fits perfectly into the books and tv shows why would they remove this element having her someone removed from the conflict eliminates dramatalisa as this mother teresa figure saving lives on the battefield playing the angel in robbs ear is about as saccharine and antimartin as it gets so either her character is horribly written or theres more to her than meets the eyepersonally im hoping there isnt some telemundo reveal that ruins the rw but ill be surprised if talisa is the first paragon in the seriesim extrapolating on this obviously because dd have not talked about their reasons for making the changes but its very clear that they would like for the lannisters and starks to have set lines that differentiate each other and have simplified many of the relationships that have greyed this line in the books 1 for instance youve got cleos frey being renamed alton lannister so that the audience is not confused with why a frey is a lannister cousin when they are supposedly backing robb 2 both the boy squires that were captured at riverrun have lannister as their last names different than the books to make this clear which side theyre from 3 the alternating changing allegiances of the bloody mummers have been jettisoned and replaced simply with locke and his group who are sworn to bolton from the start and dont switch sidesso knowing that westerlings in canon are sworn to the lannisters they removed that element of jeyne and kept the portion of their story that had the two of them fall in love in the midst of the war and getting married when it was a bad idea strategically jeyne is innocent in the books and theyve kept that part for talisa once they decided that she wasnt going to be a westerling they were free to choose her background and they eventually settled on volantis for a variety of reasons this necessitated them having to change her name so that they could not even retain the jeyne portion of the link to the book characterhell they even had the two of them visit the crag last year more as a wink to the book reader audience than anything else i imagine which also should have confirmed for all involved that she wasnt jeyne westerling although i suppose if you believe all the other crazy shit about the spy theory it wouldnt be too much of a step for you to also have no problem swallowing that the conspiracy to keep jeyne a secret stretched out to encompass every person at the crag so that her identity wouldnt be blown by anybody when she showed up with robbif blackfish is going to be at the rw with talisa and hes certainly on the road with everyone on the way to the twins so id guess he probably is then i would be guessing that theyre going to find a way to reset the storyline to more or less where we are in the books by having him escape with talisa back to rivverrun in the chaos ordered by a desperate or dying robb most likely it gives them a little bit more of a connection for when we catch up with them later and he acts as more of a father figure and protector"

"go joff go",2013-05-25,"well im rooting for the spy angle but for it to only be hinted in the rw but revealed much later in the story i dont think king tommens arguments are convincing at all i mean he brings up that book jeyne showing up was all happenstance in one breath an then shouts down talisa and robb falling for each other while she is spying on him cant be happenstance in the next breath its the same thing in my mind the scenario where jeyne was in on it all along is much more believable then the book where it was her mom conspiring against her daughter im hoping its set up where she starts out as a spy falls for robb and then has been writing misinformation to tywin only for it to be contradicted by bolton and that she isnt complicit in the rw in that way she can be both guilty and innocent it also remedies what a fish out of water jeyne was in the book being pretty much the only black and white character in some ways i think they have set her up to be like margaery remember in margaery speech to sansa she brings up the things wome will do to ensure the well being of their childrenmargaery is doing it cersei did it cat did it grandma tyrell will do it and imo talisa will do it also"

"Rashtibram",2013-05-26,"honestly i fully supported their decision to make robbs love interest a better character or even just more of a love interest having a tragic romance was a good idea for him but talisa is just taking up too much screen time we need more northerners around robb and less of his wife mom and uncles i really hope talisa dies personally not because i hate her character but because it would make the rw more emotional"

"King Tommen",2013-05-26,"i find that many people are taking the first couple scenes talisa had with robb way back in s2 and hanging on to that characterization without really looking at what the character is now how is she modern shes dutiful understanding supportive and clearly cares for robb if you just pretend the scene where she gets short with him when chopping off the guys leg didnt happen then i dont really see what the complaints are in no way does she force herself on robb or seduce him hes the one smitten with her for whatever reason and pursues her fairly relentlessly after they first meet i cant understand why anyone watching her this season would characterize her as a bitch or annoying shes been anything but i find her to be a fairly sympathetic if underdeveloped character i imagine that most people that arent bringing their book adaptation baggage into watching the show would be genuinely sad to see her die and lets call a spade a spade jeyne westerling in the books was a cipher with no personality who was barely allowed to talk or display any kind of personality there is no way any reader should have developed any kind of attachment to her at all considering that grrm clearly didnt give a shit about her as a person since she her main purpose was to be a plot point"

"King Tommen",2013-05-27,"although there are certainly deviations that the show takes away from the books they have been very careful to keep all the major plotlines and characters working towards the same endpoint as they do in the books they may take some different routes to get there but to this point everyone on the show is more or less following the path they need to be on to get where they should be in the books even when show characters are killed or omitted on the show where they remain alive in the books you can clearly see that another character is being merged or taking on the role for example missandei can take on whatever role irri plays kovarro replaced rakharo they can just have another random singer do what marillion does later one etc if the show only cared about setting off on their own story and ignoring what happens later in the books they would not continue to go to the trouble of meeting with grrm constantly to ask him about where his story is set to go but there are some characters that you cant merge or write around so if they are important to the future books then well see the show maintain this consistency within the show talisa who is filling the jeyne westerling role is one of those characters if jeynes story andor whether or not she is carrying robbs child is still relevant in twow and beyond then the show will have to find a way to keep her alive you cant merge the role of robbs widow with another character or have someone else come in later to fill in the blanks so to me talisas fate is tied to how important she is to future events in asoiaf if grrm means to not deal with her again then it probably stands to reason that talisa dies at the rw because theres no point in keeping her around and its a far more dramatic way to say goodbye to the character than have her rot at riverrun and barely mentioned ever again i think its curious to see that barring a last minute trip back to riverrun that it appears the blackfish will be attending the rw i think the odds are much stronger that the blackfish still has a relatively big part to play in the saga so i have a hard time believing hed be killed at the rw which leaves two possibilities he either escapes somehow or hes captured if he escapes i think its probably with talisa because there would be no other reason to include that development if it werent to get her out of there and back to riverrun so they could reset to the book narrative and build up their future protectorfather figure relationship dramatically they wouldnt just have him escaping on his own since it would be against his character to just abandon robb to save himself he would only be compelled to leave if ordered by robb in order to save his wife and unborn child if he was just going to get out by himself they wouldnt have even bothered to have him attend he could have just stayed back at riverrun as he did in the books if hes captured then the idea is probably for him to fill the greatjon role and be the loyal bannerman who needs to be subdued but not without a fight this is a possibility since they have given him a little more of a gruffer personality and even some of the greatjon actions punching karstark when he mouths off robb for example so they could just be looking to have him fill that role if they wanted to reset to the book narrative theyd have to write around that later on to somehow get him back to riverrun but it could be done i still think the first option is more likely and what to make of talisa telling robb shes pregnant to me its a big deal and probably an important development it is possible that theyre doing this simply to have her death at the rw be more tragic but the rw is overflowing with miserable things happening to the starks is it entirely necessary for robb to have to witness his wife and unborn child be butchered before going down on top of everything else it seems awfully excessive remember that grrm wrote the scene on the show where talisa tells robb of this and of course hes going by outlines set out by dd but i think it would be incredibly odd to have this happen if it was not the case in the books there is no good reason to introduce this development on the show unless jeyne is actually pregnant in the books its too big of a change and sets things on a way different path that would be way too hard to write around to get back on track so i guess you either fall into 2 camps i dont include the talisa is a spy camp because thats ridiculous beyond words either dd felt that the rw wasnt tragic enough so they believed subjecting robb and cat to the death of talisa and robbs unborn child was necessary or they wanted to reveal to the audience a development that grrm would be bringing up down the road and develop talisa a little bit more as a result because they knew shed still have a part to play"

"Winter In My Heart",2013-05-27,"its funny everyone keeps saying to throw out the first scene how exactly is someone just supposed to forget the first annoying impression someone gives i mean in all seriousness not even just with talisa but anyone in general if you forget the first scene is one of the worst arguments ive read on this forum and a few people have said it now talisa is not jeyne i wish people would stop calling jeyne as talisa and talisa as jeyne one is a foreigner and the other isnt among other differences i personally dont think either of them are saints but talisa is definitely more annoying with her outspokenmodern attitude and i havent read many people call her a suductress but she does in fact pursue him a little bit granted he does more of the pursing otherwise theres no need for her to barge into his tent on a couple different occasionsbut yeah theyre are differences between the charactes and jeyne imo fits in better with the world than talisa but everyone arguing throw out the first scene not even mentioning to forget the tent barging is a horrible argument"
"King Tommen",2013-05-27,"people are saying throw out the first scene because her attitude in that scene is pretty well the opposite of the way she is portrayed afterwards if you tuned in for the start of this season and had not seen talisa and robb before there is no way you would characterize talisa as modern or not part of the asoiaf universe shes a dutiful caring kind respectful wife who robb confides in and cares for himself the meet cute scene was poorly written but were allowed to move past that hanging on to one scene and ignoring the rest is kind of silly i can think of lots of shows and movies that had silly intros for characters but eventually they found a better footing for the character and you grew to like or respect them more i dont even get the barging into robbs tent stuff either she doesnt barge in she knocks or the equivalent of whatever you do to try and knock to get into a tent she politely asks if shes able to talk to the guy who has sought her out on multiple occasions prior to that and its not like shes sashaying in to shoot the shit she has requests in her role as nurse that she would like to ask of him and hes clearly happy to see her when she comes so its a fairly weak argument to make robbs bannerman are annoyed clearly but its not at her its at robb for prioritizing the conversation with talisa over theirs its not her fault i cant quite understand if people want her to be a mousy never speak unless spoken to trembling little girl to be able to fit in with what their expectation of the character should be this of course ignores the many female characters on the show who carry themselves with confidence and have no problem interacting with men at an equal level cat arya brienne dany margaery qot cersei etc etc remember that shes not commonfolk shes from a noble family so even though shes working as a nurse old habits are going to remain and shes going to carry herself the way she was brought up which was someone of importance and status robb even susses this out from her shortly after chatting thats probably one of the reasons that hes supposed to be intrigued by her finally you need to equate her with jeyne westerling because shes filling the role on the show its a different character with a different background but she obviously has the same purpose its the same thing as understanding that locke is not vargo hoat hes not a sellsword but a man serving roose but hes going to be fulfilling the same plot points of the character"
"Winter In My Heart",2013-05-27,"i can understand for people who havent seen the scene to obviously not care much to how they meet but when thats peoples first impression of her its kind of hard to just forget that to be honest my problem with her isnt exactly that she mouths off a few times but it is kind of annoying its how this supposed kind and caring nurse appears so snobby and fully of herself imo the scene where she speaks to robb in the woods and guards come to tell him about cats betrayal and how she holds herself when the guard is there is a perfect exactly how i think she comes off so uppity the lannister boys scene was another one where i thought she was being more snobby rather than kind to them i dont know if the actress intended to give her character that vibe or not all i know is thats the way it comes off to me the two characters fill the same role but there are still some differences between them i know in hindsight that really means little but theyre still different in background and ethnicity and whatnot that people shouldnt be switching their names so easily it is kind of an insult to both characters imo dd just cant write meek or non badass characters thats why cat and sansa have pretty much been shit on thats a big reason why imo they made talisa in the first place if we had jeyne even if they tweaked things and fleshed her out a bit she would get the shaft just as catelyn does and her knowing extensive nursing knowledge is modern imo considering only maesters should know that stuff im fairly certain or the impression the books gave me was jeyne just knew simple stuff women in that time shouldnt know the sort of knowledge talisa does at least thats how it came off to me in the books so her being a nurse definitely makes me think of her as more modern not to mention its unrealistic that men never tried to rape her i just cant see her being a virgin theres no way basically overall she is just a horribly written character i wouldnt say shes as bad this season but her horrible scenes last season are hard to just forget theres to many plot holes with her on top of that i find it funny people say shes a great character yet a lot of show only viewers i talk to think shes out of place on this world even for a badass character honestly what does that say about dds writing of this character if show only viewers who have no knowledge of jeyne and the change that watches think she is oddly out of place edited by winter in my heart 27 may 2013  1101 pm"

"lunadangelo",2013-05-28,"it is taking it out of context to say that i said she yelled not in innocent and a slut to me just because i mentioned possible rape the two are not the same thing mentioning rape doesnt mean that was what i thought she wasnt innocent and a slut abouti never said robb wasnt innocent but she didnt help matters any and like i said when i wrote that it wasnt meant to come off that being raped equals slut i definitely wouldnt say anything like that about any woman especially considering i am one i just dont see how she can be a virgin even without the possibility that she was raped i only mentioned rape because considering shes following battle camps theres the high possibility she could have been so no i hadnt mentioned rape to imply that she was somehow a slut because of that happening if it came off that way then yes it was lack of transition between the two thoughts in my post since people like to nit pick evey sentence ill just reiterate i do not think being raped would equal being a slutbut in the context of the show even if she was somehow a virgin before robb its still slutty for a high born woman to go spreading her legs for guys she wasnt married to imo anywaywow the kind of comments you have made regarding women are boggling to me you are a female and you call a fictional character a <U+0080>slut<U+0080><U+0099> i am not sure where to start herei have had pre marital sex am i therefore a <U+0080>slut<U+0080><U+0099> in your mindif i <U+0080>put myself<U+0080><U+0099> in a <U+0080> dangerous<U+0080><U+0099> situation by being drunk and alone on my way home and then get raped am i therefore in your view partially to blameare women who enjoy sex slutsps apologies to pretty much all of you who are on here to debate talisas fate for the distraction i unfortunately felt that i had to respond to this edited by lunadangelo 28 may 2013  0524 pm"

"zaphodbrx",2013-05-28,"this whole jeynetalisa change does not make sense and the only way i can make sense of it is to jump aboard the bandwagon that talisa is a spy that is the only slightly logical explanation as to why they changed it my brain needs something to grasp and its that theoryagreei found a nice post from season 2 which details all the problems with this character and it makes a lot more sense if shes a spyits also important to note that she has been sabotaging the norths war effort since day 1 how many battles has robb fought since then thats right none he just moves around randomly and lays siege to empty castlesthere are so many inconsistencies with both characters that i do not understand those who try to say this is better story telling compared to the books one thing is to say that it still looks good and it still is good tv no one will go against that i think the show is still quite enjoyable but pleaseit kills me to see some people who say things like this is better or that grrm was the one who made the mistakepeoplelook at robb from the show look at how he reacts to theon when they are discussing if the north should go to war does that look like someone who will take it well to be questioned nope look at robb when the great john questions his decisions does that look like someone who will tolerate any complains or alternative plans nope look at robb when his mother tries to tell him she wants to go home and theon should not be sent to the iron islands does robb seems to enjoy this does he take any advice from his mother nopenow please tell us why the hell would someone like this enjoy a girl questioning him in an open field and close to some of his soldiers  lords and now we have the girl first she is introduced as a nurse that roams around the batlefield and has some sort of issue against war and against robb invading the westerlandsif she is foreign what does she care about the westerlands and if she is a foreign nurse why does she take one side of the conflict over the other or are we to believe that she did the same complaints to tywin or to gregor clegane now that would have been fun next episode she is writting some letters all alone in robbacutes camp why is she staying with robbacutes army on the previous episode it looked like she had just left and she did not want to work for the north so why is she with them now did they arrest her or keep her there against her will did she decide to change sides in the meanwhile why she did not seem like she wanted to change sides the first time we did meet her and by the way she is now quite a bit less sassy in general and again what is she doing all alone with the northern army who protects her who keeps her safe gives her food and stops her from being rapped is it robb why would he then we go another episode and now she has a position in which she can ask robb for supplies is she now the main nurse and responsible for that kind of stuff since when how did she get that kind of position is she such a good nurse that robb decided to take her and make her like the armyacutes maester dont they have the silent sisters who should really be doing that kind of work can anyone explain why a military leader would pick a foreigner who clearly said she was playing for the other side and take this lady to lead your medical services for your army why does she even trust her asking for provisions that could be really dangerous if she ends up being a turncoat and how does he know she isnt ahhhand it is still weird how she can be all alone and safe toying around a foreign armyyeahhhh and finally we have kind of confirmation that the girl seems to be really a foreigner and she is all sweet and bla bla bla she loves her brother and bla bla blawellwhat is she doing so far away from her brother then and i dont buy it that she cant live on a slaver citywell cant she complain about that to her brother and family thus trying to solve the slave problem there how is she doing anything good for the slaves by running away to take care of soldiers you would expect someone like her would be more like a village nurse and not a field army nurseor she should be a slave nurse back home taking care of the slaves and doing her best to help them live betterand now just try and place this noble girl going all out on a foreign king which she gets to know is already engagedshe even gets to know that the engagement is quite important besides she is supposed to be against the very thing he represents which is a leader who is going to war over something she does not understandor at least that was her mindset 3 episodes agoi guess it doesnt matter anymore you seethe only way for all of this to fit together is if she is just another spoiled brat that just does whatever she feels like on the spot without that much inner tought about it edited by zaphodbrx 28 may 2013  1148 pm"

"King Tommen",2013-05-29,"thats true theyve really done hardly anything to explain this character and her story maybe theyre counting season two and three as two years but that is a complete contradiction to the timeline where dany mentions not having dragons about a year ago so my only thought is maybe she did nursing things back in volantis before coming there but that doesnt make a ton of sense either how long exactly does it take to travel from volantis to westeros and end up with the northern armyagain why do people read so much into this to a ridiculous degree shes said shes been doing nursing stuff for the last 2 years she doesnt say where presumably she didnt learn to be a nurse the day she stepped onto the battlefields at the riverlands there are lots of wars around the world that she could have been a part of really it shouldnt matter because its not fucking importanti imagine the same people complaining that talisas character and backstory have not been fleshed out would be screaming bloody murder if the show actually went ahead and did this because it would be taking time away from the other characters this was always going to be a nowin proposition for the producers because god knows that the book fans would find a way to complain regardless of what happenedshes an underwritten character because they needed her to serve a purpose and this is how they decided to do it and didnt spend a whole lot of time on creating a big backstory for it because they didnt think it was important they needed robb to fall in love with someone quickly while he was almost exclusively in camps on the battlefield that limited the options so making up a nurse seemed like the best choice available to them they count on suspension of disbelief from the audience on everything else because they dont have time to talk about the how and why she was there in the first place i know i sure as fuck didnt care about those questions the vast majority of the audience doesnt either nit pickers will nit pick of course thats what westerosorg is for it appears"
"Winter In My Heart",2013-05-29,"again why do people read so much into this to a ridiculous degree shes said shes been doing nursing stuff for the last 2 years she doesnt say where presumably she didnt learn to be a nurse the day she stepped onto the battlefields at the riverlands there are lots of wars around the world that she could have been a part of really it shouldnt matter because its not fucking importanti imagine the same people complaining that talisas character and backstory have not been fleshed out would be screaming bloody murder if the show actually went ahead and did this because it would be taking time away from the other characters this was always going to be a nowin proposition for the producers because god knows that the book fans would find a way to complain regardless of what happenedshes an underwritten character because they needed her to serve a purpose and this is how they decided to do it and didnt spend a whole lot of time on creating a big backstory for it because they didnt think it was important they needed robb to fall in love with someone quickly while he was almost exclusively in camps on the battlefield that limited the options so making up a nurse seemed like the best choice available to them they count on suspension of disbelief from the audience on everything else because they dont have time to talk about the how and why she was there in the first place i know i sure as fuck didnt care about those questions the vast majority of the audience doesnt either nit pickers will nit pick of course thats what westerosorg is for it appearsum that just shows they really dont care about arcs if they cant even bother to give her a decent backstory to make her a little more believable what does that say about what the writers will do in the future i wouldnt mind if they showed a couple scenes of her to explain and fill in plot holes but no they dont care about robb or catelyn so they butchered their arcs show only viewers arent complete idiots i know my mom when she watches things and hasnt read a book or whatever something is based off of thinks about whats logical and what seems not to be in said show or movie i know not all people do that but there are people who watch stuff and think wait how much sense does that makeso yes by your logic the writers obviously think show only viewers are idiots and they also consider the rw plot to be useless and not important if they cant even bother to give the woman robb marries and causes his demise more of a backstory"
"King Tommen",2013-05-29,"then i guess grrm thought the same thing since jeyne westerling had nothing approaching a backstory and was basically not allowed to speak when we had that chance to see her some characters dont need long backstories they are there to serve a function for the plot and thats pretty much it you dont need talisas backstory to see that robb is smitten with her when he meets her and that they get together because of this where she comes from isnt important just as what the hell was up with jeyne westerling wasnt important"
"DarkAndFullOfTurnips",2013-05-29,"um that just shows they really dont care about arcs if they cant even bother to give her a decent backstory to make her a little more believable what does that say about what the writers will do in the future i wouldnt mind if they showed a couple scenes of her to explain and fill in plot holes but no they dont care about robb or catelyn so they butchered their arcs show only viewers arent complete idiots i know my mom when she watches things and hasnt read a book or whatever something is based off of thinks about whats logical and what seems not to be in said show or movie i know not all people do that but there are people who watch stuff and think wait how much sense does that makeso yes by your logic the writers obviously think show only viewers are idiots and they also consider the rw plot to be useless and not important if they cant even bother to give the woman robb marries and causes his demise more of a backstorywhat backstory does jeyne westerling have ill answer it for you  much less of a story than talisa who cares her only purpose is to make robb be a dope"

"Cas Stark",2013-05-29,"talisa is not a warrior queen riding into battle nor is she a silent sister she is presented as a lone woman nurse in the show unaffiliated with anyone so these examples are not relevant to whether it makes sense that a lone woman by herself can travel around a war zone buying supplies getting transported to the battles and so forth rape is part of war i dont see what is so difficult to understand about that she is not a silent sister so she would not be afforded that protection but we see in the war that even the silent sisters are raped children are raped and murdered how is it that talisa has been able to stay safeshe amazingly is able to stay out of the battles when theyre occuring away from the raping and pillaging part of war and only miraculously shows up after the battles are over where her nursing is highly prized oh okay well that makes total sense then lol"

"Khal-a-bunga",2013-05-29,"talisa is not a warrior queen riding into battle nor is she a silent sister she is presented as a lone woman nurse in the show unaffiliated with anyone so these examples are not relevant to whether it makes sense that a lone woman by herself can travel around a war zone buying supplies getting transported to the battles and so forthrape is part of war i dont see what is so difficult to understand about that she is not a silent sister so she would not be afforded that protection but we see in the war that even the silent sisters are raped children are raped and murdered how is it that talisa has been able to stay safeshe amazingly is able to stay out of the battles when theyre occuring away from the raping and pillaging part of war and only miraculously shows up after the battles are over where her nursing is highly prized oh okay well that makes total sense then lolhow do you even know how long shes been following this army you dont youre making assumptions perhaps this is the first time shes offered her services after a battle maybe she has been continuing her medicinal study at the crag which is why shes so familiar with it and traveled to the site of the battle to help the wounded which is much more in character for her than what youre proposing and i noted above that those articles focused on women who fought in battles but thats not the entirety of their subject matter which you seem to have ignored along with everything else i posted hate away it doesnt bother me but dont act like youre right just because it suits your stance on how this particular story line has been adapted going by your logic arya should have been raped countless times by now during her travels and yet i dont see you taking issue with thathonestly your whole stance is a bit misogynistic for my tastes its like you think that every soldier would have one thing on their mind  raping women i highly doubt that was the case it was a brutal time if were using our own medieval history as a basis but we wouldnt have survived long as a species if our faults werent often tempered by our better nature if nothing else the fact that robb is such a good person should be enough reason as to why talisa was able to travel freely among the men he is the king in the north after all and since he didnt allow prisoners to be tortured what makes you think he would allow his men to rape and pillage followers in their own camp talk about making total sense"

"Winter In My Heart",2013-05-29,"i have to wonder if the two of you have ever watched anything else on television or film because you two seem to be awfully hung up on how unrealistic talisa being there in the aftermath of that battle is and nothing else have you ever questioned why so many characters seem to end up in the right place at the right time or vice versa or why things always seem to happen in the nick of time for the most part your criticism has focused on that introductory scene and not a single scene that has followed sure youve given vague and unspecific answers to why you dont like the character or that segment of robbs story line  poorly written poorly acted poorly directed  but you dont actually go into any kind of critical details as to why you feel that way specific examples and reasoning as to why its not any good would go a long way towards you two seeing that were not trying to be apologists or uppity but that seems to be too much to ask and again im referring to any scene other than her first scene with robbfor instance what are your thoughts on the guy who was traveling with talisa when we first met her the person who was leading the horse pulling the wagon what of him his presence would seem to indicate that she was in fact not traveling there by herself would it not and then a good portion of your argument falls apart we could discuss that but im sure we wont because all those of you who are so passionately against her want to do is repeat the same thing ad nauseum instead of having an actual discussion and also because youd likely label it a plot hole when its abundantly clear that you dont understand what a plot hole isand after that initial scene what is it about talisa that makes her writing so terrible or her oona chaplins writing so awful youre purposely ignoring any actual criticism so you can continue to do that or you can just continue to call those of us willing to discuss this character and plot line uppity and label us as apologistsi have no opinion of a guy whos not shown but only once and never shown againand to be honest im tired of arguing the same things many things have been posted on numerous threads aside from this one why the writing is not good i havent seen you list any reasons why its oh so great and superior to anything martin could write but just to give an example of a scene i hated the lannister boys scene she came off stuck up to me i dont know if it was the facial expbbressions the actress makes added in with the lines or what but she didnt seem all that kind and caring to me when she spoke to themand it is kind of uppity when you want to claim how shes better because shes modern when in fact this series isnt supposed to be a modern one i dont understand the logic in that edited by winter in my heart 29 may 2013  0658 pm"
"Cas Stark",2013-05-29,"shes going to die at the rw the very fact that oona has been so adament in what a great modern love story they have cemented for me that shes not a spy and so she will have to die i doubt oona is going to go to the trouble of directly trolling the audience by giving misleading tv interviews where she gushes about the modern romance that the audience should get behind all the while knowing her character is really a lannister spy as for the random nameless extra leading the horse there is no reason to believe he was traveling with talisa if he was he should have been seen in subsequent scenes and he never appeared again she has always appeared alone why doesnt she know where winterfell is for gods sake shes queen in the north for what possible reason did the writers throw that line in there why has she never apologized to robb or cat or anyone for the massive strain she put on robb by marrying him and causing him to lose part of his army and lose face with his bannermen for that matter why did she even care about marrying robb shes a modern independent woman who is anti war to boot wouldnt it have been more in line with her characterization to be his mistress thus preventing the breech of his men and likely causing the war to drag on she never ever mentions marriage to him or children she has no family in westeros who would be scandalized if she didnt marry robb but was his mistress at least until he won the war edited by cas stark 29 may 2013  0723 pm"

"MarieAntoinette",2013-04-23,"im really interested in how the rw will be handled in the books it was catelyn point of view that made it so heartbreaking for me robb getting stabbed in front of her eyes was horrible im curious about talisa also i dislike this character and the story they have created for her so i kind of hope that she just gets offed at the rw and thats it"

"HailStannis",2013-04-23,"the saddest part of the rw for me was the fact that it had been teased for pretty much the whole book that cat and arya were going to be reunited i wasnt the biggest fan of cat but i was actually extremely happy for her i suspected rob would eventually die but i figured it would be the boltons betraying him at the war in the north not at a wedding it was quite surreal with aryas chapter prior to the rw when she finally caught up to cat after so many chapters of travelling i was waiting the whole of cats chapter for arya and the hound to burst in the door and witness one of the true happy moments of the series wow what a bait and switch that turned out to be even once rob was killed i still clinged onto hope that cat would live and be reunited with a captured arya or something it was shocking to me when she died the arya chapter that followed only made me angrier i didnt quite believe she was dead it was out of character for the hound to kill her but i was in such agony im fairly certain i flicked through the book to see if she had any more chapters without doing that i couldnt actually focus on the rest of the story"

"Starq",2013-04-24,"i hope that at some point in this episode or in the preceeding episodes the story behind the song the rains of castamere is explained i hope there is mention of the rainetarbeck rebellion and how tywin put them to the sword i think this will make the rw scene even more epic imo in one of the trailers tyrion is quoted as saying something along the lines of 7 kingdoms in fear of tywin lannister perhaps this is in reference to what he did to the raines so maybe there is a scene where tyrion is explaining this do you agree and do you think it will happen"
"WheelofIceandFire",2013-04-24,"do you think sansa will appear in this episode its obviously going to focus on the starks and robb cat and arya are definitely going to be in it i can also see jon and bran appearing but dont think they really need to feature kings landing i love the scenes and characters at the kings landing but they tyrion cersei etc have been featured in almost every episode so far in the entire series and i think this episode would be better if it didnt feature anything at kings landing they need to build up to the big moment throughout the night and i wouldnt really like it if they go from a scene with robb and cat to a scene at kings landing or anybody else to be honest i think it would be best to just focus on the starks instead of jumping to tyrioncerseistannisdany etc edited by wheeloficeandfire 24 april 2013  0147 pm"

"Khal-a-bunga",2013-05-09,"but the show hasnt given us a team stark its been just robb all the lords in the north who are part of his alliance who are killed at the rw are missingyeah because thats exactly what the show needs  more characters its unfortunate that clive mantle wasnt able to reprise his role at the greatjon but thats just how it works out sometimes at this point theres already enough going on in the story and between the greatjon in the first season only roose  karstark second and third seasons and edmure  the blackfish this season only thats a decent number of what essentially amount to tertiary characters except for bolton of course but his importance doesnt come until well after his introduction surrounding robb for the general audience to keep track of i agree that the red wedding will surely have a different impact on the show than it did in the books but i dont think that necessarily means it will be better or worse if anything i think the event may be more visceral in the show even if it isnt the total massacre it is in the book though we are supposed to get a manderly some time soon"
"Dragonstoned",2013-05-09,"i am surprised that given how the rw was what motivated them to make the series the showrunners have made changes to the buildup robbs different reason for oathbreaking the freys as apparently neutral instead of ex veteran allies that robb had a solid plan to take back his home absence of other northern lords which took it from assassination attempt to massacre but i dont think it will diminish the impact simply cos its the red fucking weddingthough we are supposed to get a manderly some time soonyeah a shot of the ceremony was leaked that showed wendel manderly standing beside roose and the guy that played him was meant to be in e05 none of the other people you mention will be there on the losing side though the only addition looks like talisa edited by dragonstoned 09 may 2013  0355 am"

"The Fourth Head",2013-05-17,"httpswwwyoutubehvpvvxh6nbcaayeah i can now see where they are taking many of the starks in generali love the final few seconds of the stark soundtrack it has cold hearted vengeance written all over it winter is coming and so is vengeanceon the subject of how the editors will incorporate ramseys reveal around the rw here are a few thoughtsi think the show has been setting up a clear theme of disrespect and underestimating the danger of the boltons they have played on lockes feelings of jealousy of being underestimated patronised and his vicious sense of revenge to the extent that i actually felt a ridiculous tinge of sympathy for him when he was beaten by jamie humiliated about the sapphires and sullenly watching jamie walk off his only form of joy had been spoiled i dont think its a random adaptation by the show to make an injured sense of worth the reason for why they made locke a bolton man and for why locke cut off jamies handobviously ramsey has this massive respect issue surrounding his bastard status but they have yet to play that card and even roose subtly emphasised a sympathy with locke when he commented on how he thought jamie would have learnt his lesson about overplaying his hand position humiliating brienne in a dress and commenting on it was another subtle aspect they chose to emphasise essentially its all been about power and respect when we get to find out his bastard status and the complex he has about it people will understand far better why theon has been tortured all season due to a desperately injured sense of worth and a desperate lust for acknowledgementthey have clearly waited all this time for a reason to reveal ramseys identity bastard status and therefore motives for torturing theon and this could be the perfect moment to reveal it just as we are about to realise that roose bolton has been massively underestimated and ignored for too long and that he too deserves a lot more respect from the audience the difference is roose doesnt shout about whereas ramsey can if ramseys reveal comes after the rw people will not be impressed that this roose bolton nobody was the one who killed the king in the north and it will diminish the poignancy of the moment which is all rather ironici think it would be cool if they integrated it with the rw keeping the rw foreshadowing fairly low key until a cut midway through the wedding in full swing to him and theon in a silent dungeon everything is laughter and music then cut toboyb this game is getting boring now ill give you one last guess as to who i am before i cut off your facet your ramsey ramsey snow youre lord boltons bastardb cue look of manic disappointment and rage never call me bastard im roose boltons trueborn son and its time you learnt to show me a little more respectcue more pain ramsey stands back and pausesb do you think this just about me nooo its not just about me people have been disrespecting the boltons for years the starks they have never respected our ways our customs looking down their noses at us outlawing our practices making us hide our ways like petty criminals ways we have kept to for thousands of years our way is the old way the starks have forgotten that but i think that may be about to change did you know those stark boys have been captured a trolling exercise but the audience wont know it those boys will come to learn the meaning of the word respect when i am done with them and all thanks to you well done you must feel so proud to serve a higher purpose and as for your high and mighty robb stark the king in the north well its high time he learned a little bit of respect too do you know where he is right now hes at a wedding right now with my dear old father roose i fear my father hasnt been shown enough respect either such a shame i wasnt invited to the wedding i would have loved to watch still its not a total loss i guess we will just have to make our own entertainment together wont that be nicecogs whirring omfg roose but as this comes so close to the action it doesnt matter any morecut back to rw noise laughter cacophony roose slips out noted by cat shiiiiiiiit wheres he going now then whats he up to then the music changes to rains of castamere and bam instant corony for anyone with a brain we all realise at the same time as cat that the music signals the end of the farce no words no actions needed times upit will also add significance to the shift in culture in the north from stark to bolton when roose stabs robb in season 2 roose suggested torturing prisoners and robb dismissed him with this ramsey reveal connecting with locke and roose it will very much feel like a changing of the guard moment one that was lost on me in the books what with ramsey explaining who the boltons are to theon just before the starks lose the north to them having an idea what the future holds under the boltons will add so much more depth to the moment bad triumphs over good and doing it this way will be a nice way of linking in all this gratuitous violence we have endured and dumping it on rooses doorstep at just the right moment edited by the fourth head 17 may

"Khal-a-bunga",2013-05-21,"if some viewers were to leave the show i think itd be more out of a sense of why do i continue to watch bad things happen to good people kind of mentality but theyll be backas far as the reaction to robb  catelyn dying its gonna be big i know that around these parts we like to think were tuned in to what the average viewer thinks but thats not really the case our criticisms are usually not their criticisms considering nonreaders dont really have the same expectations that we do as it concerns the show another thing is that the number of viewers who likely engage in any type of fan forum such as wiccom  westerosorg are pretty small compared to the overall number of viewers and since this show is the most pirated in the world it could be deduced that a fair amount of those who discuss the show online arent watching through official channels and also dont represent the average vieweri was at a bachelor party with a lot of friends and a few strangers and almost every person in this group of roughly 20 guys has been watching the show and most of them started somewhat recently though right now im the only one who has read the books when one of the guys brought up that he thought robb stark is doomed most of the group disagreed pretty vehementlyyou cant kill the king in the northwho will fight the lannister family if they kill robbhim and that chick with the dragons are going to meet up and wreck shitetc and the few guys who did agree thought that it would happen when he attacks casterly rock the lannister castleplace between that red herring and the explanation that cersei gave for the rains of castamere to margaery right before threatening to kill her i think theyve sufficiently thrown most of the audience off the of the trail of course the more observant and detailoriented viewers might still be wary of this trip to the twins but the manner in which everything goes down should still surprise even those viewersi think there are going to be a lot of shocked and pissed viewers after the episode as there should be considering all that will happen with the stark family in this episode with two groups of them almost meeting up jon with rickon  bran  arya with catelyn  robb emotions will already be running high for a lot of viewers because the bottom line is whether youre a big fan of the characters individually or not collectively the stark family are the heroes of this story right now and really issues of character adaptation aside that makes perfect sense all of the members of the stark family are portrayed by fantastic actors and throughout these three seasons theyve all had some great moments that have endeared them to the audience i suspect that the gaping hole feeling that some experienced with ned will be less prevalent but the sheer brutality of the massacre  especially catelyn being killed and whats done to her and robbs bodies  will strike a much deeper chord with viewers i actually think its going to catch some book readers off guard as well reading about something and actually seeing it onscreen are two very different things both can inspire an incredible amount and depth of feeling but theres always something more visceral about actually seeing it in any case im equal parts excited and nervous to watch the episode theres a lot of expectation that comes along with this event so im going to make sure i give it a few views and let it sink in before coming to any definitive conclusions on how i feel about it edited by khalabunga 21 may 2013  1156 pm"

"ExBruinsFan",2013-05-27,"that is not possible it was the scene that made them want to adapt the books why would they blow their money for everything else but their primary reason for starting the project in the first place i think it would occur to them to save some besides wasnt whispering wood off screen in the books anywayi know they said that but the build up has been almost nonexistent for rw episode 8 should have been almost all set up for the heart breakafter completely skipping the battle at the fist with that teaser at the end of s2 i would not put anything past them maybe it will just be arya and sandor reacting to what they see and hearthat would be the final straw for me"
