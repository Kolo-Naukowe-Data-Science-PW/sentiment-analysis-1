"towerofjoy",2012-04-29,"first episode for me that flew by think it is starting to get good loved arya  anyone can be killed take that to heart tywin or perhaps to your gut would be more appropriate"
"RandomWanderer",2012-04-29,"this second season in general really isnt doing it for me i feel there is just a lot missingbeing rushed with arya then again fitting it all in 10 episodes is ridiculous to begin with the only episode i can honestly say i like so far this season is ep3"

"Pontius the Penniless",2012-04-29,"i will not be very happy if jojen and meera dont show up we already missed out on seeing the blackfish in season 1 otherwise i thought this episode was one of the best ones so far this season"
"Fez",2012-04-29,"not saying theres a causation between there being no pointless sex scenes or added scenes that dragged on forever and this being my favorite episode of the season thus far but theres definitely a correlation even though jagens occasional use of pronouns was disappointing overall he was great arya was also great as always loved her short monologue on her brother bronn getting lots of lines was a welcome move as well qarth still seems more like a cheesy 80s thing but im starting to dig it iceland truly looks beautiful i gotta visit sometime"
"ckal",2012-04-29,"this was an awesome episode definitely the best one so far just like the book it took about half way to really get going things are going to be kicked into overdrive for the last 5 eps cant wait"
"Nymphetamine",2012-04-29,"jaqen hghar was exactly how i pictured him in the books"
"Baitac",2012-04-29,"i thought it was a good transitional episode theres a new boss or bosses in town and thats the series writers theres a lot of consolidation simplification and plain old skipping of scenes and characters i still love the series although it is different from the books in some aspects they still keep the spirit of the books even if they dont follow the letter exactly"
"arya horsefaceless",2012-04-29,"arya is just awesome this season a rickon signing which was pretty funny i guess next episode will end where theon says hes going after winterfell just a great episode from start to finish it didnt fee like there was any wasted time in there"
"LauraD",2012-04-29,"loved davos showing his struggle between being stanniss right hand man and stanniss friend the bit with jorah was a poorly written scene that was made brilliant by sharp acting im really enjoying how theyre doing arya right also shirtless gendry enjoyed that too"
"House Snow",2012-04-29,"i loved the episode i think people are going to need to suck it up and accept that there are going to be changes it was a fantastic episode from start to finish also who knows maybe those two orphans will end up being j and m yes i know they gave bran his dream but you know giving bran the dreams made for good tv better than if jojen had them to be honest its too bad bran doesnt have a lot of screen time bc the kid who is playing him is near masies level"
"Lord Godric",2012-04-29,"i will not be very happy if jojen and meera dont show up we already missed out on seeing the blackfish in season 1 otherwise i thought this episode was one of the best ones so far this seasonthe reeds have not been cast but perhaps theyll show up in season 3this was a very solid episode i have no complaints and there were a lot of scenes i absolutely loved also some very solid acting from many of the actors particularly arya bran and brienne"
"tolthar",2012-04-29,"3 eyed raven"
"Ran",2012-04-29,"even though jagens occasional use of pronouns was disappointingthats from the booki think 3 is still the best episode of the season after having decided in the days after declaring 4 the best that it had some significant problems the opening to this was very deflating and it colored everything else a bit missed opportunitiesluisno thats not from the book wildfire never brought anyone anything but trouble it certainly didnt do anything for the targaryens edited by ran 29 april 2012  0917 pm"
"ckal",2012-04-29,"arya horsefaceless i think next ep will be theon taking winterfell by the look of the preview and i agree superb episode and there were no scenes that dragged or didnt have purpose just a shame we dont see much of jaime or robb this season"
"Baitac",2012-04-29,"did rickon actually have any lines or was it all sound effects"
"A Dark And Stormy Knight",2012-04-29,"thats right game of thrones thats more like it more episodes like this varys please a man is reminded how amazing this adaptation can be"
"ckal",2012-04-29,"and we got to see drogon which was awesome and ghost"
"Darth Pipes",2012-04-29,"good episode although i didnt care for some of the changes i guess king in the north means literally king in the northgo fuck yourselves riverlands renlys death in the book was much better though brienne kicking ass was pretty cool liked brans scene a lot too hey rickon youre still alive i was amused by what he was doing with the walnuts i dont mind the ticklers getting it early he disappears for so long in the book that nonreaders might not even remember when he shows up again later arya still needs to kill one of her enemies when that moment is eventaully shot though loved the scene with her and tywin and that is a fascinating dynamic although its going to be hard to justify her not telling jaqen to kill tywin liked stannisdavos liked catbrienne even more despite having to rush through that a little i think cersei did come up with the wildfire idea but it was tyrion who utilized it in a way that didnt burn down the entire freakin city more bronn a plus more edd a plus we live for another day hoorah liked seeing qhorin and im glad that they kept his line about never being called a lord before i am having a problem with this season though its hard to focus on whats going on because they can only spend a limited amount of time on each storyline season 1 handled that well but season 2 is having a problem with all the new characters and stories"
"Cheese Pudding",2012-04-29,"green dreams bran is more complete in the series than in the books lol tywin was a bit soft imo rude with his nephew but he was too nice with arya and loras not accusing brienne strange good episode though davos arya and tyrion were great"
"ckal",2012-04-29,"thats right game of thrones thats more like itmore episodes like this varys please a man is reminded how amazing this adaptation can beqft"
"I'm the Ghost in Harrenhal",2012-04-29,"loved this episode minus them changing who arya chooses as her first kill the scene with her and the tickler in the books gave me chills it was just so good i guess i can understand they dont want to make her seem psycho on the show but a girl is sad"
"Darth Pipes",2012-04-29,"forgot to mentionpyat pree was very freaky in a good way i love the look of qarth"
"House Snow",2012-04-29,"thats from the booki think 3 is still the best episode of the season after having decided in the days after declaring 4 the best that it had some significant problems the opening to this was very deflating and it colored everything else a bit missed opportunitiesluisno thats not from the book wildfire never brought anyone anything but trouble it certainly didnt do anything for the targaryenshow so bc brienne was the badass instead of loras or bc it didnt look like stannis"
"J_Crews",2012-04-29,"no jojen and meera wtfyeah i think that ship has sailed sadly i had high hopes wed see the reeds next season but now im doubting it jojen at least is now totally superfluous since theyve given his greendreams to bran maybe well still get meera but probably not her only real purpose now would be to tell the story of the knight of the laughing tree which they can have luwin do at some point over the next few weeks spoiler im now drifting toward the idea luwin survives and takes rickon so osha can go north with bran and hodor"
"The Nerdly Knight",2012-04-29,"my thought exactlybecause it was never his idea originally but cerseis tyrions idea was the great chainwith that said this was a fantastic episode especially for being a transitional one it helped to build up a lot of tension for what is coming and really has me excited for next week jacqen was great this week even if his first kill was the tickler add in great scenes with arya and davos and i really enjoyed it i do have to admit that i still dislike the fact that the reeds hadnt been cast for this season but it something to live with"
"LuisDantas",2012-04-29,"some specific comments  aryas scenes were very well done her conversations with tywin and jaqen flowed real nicely tywins cunning kept being shown  it is a shame that apparently we will have no sign of ramsay this season and apparently no jojen or meera for a long time if at all still time constraints i guess it couldnt be helped  nice to see that they are allowing no ambiguity about stannis knowledge and moral flaws  renly and catelyn seemed to have a better understanding than in the books again i like it it sort of emphasizes the depth of loss that renlys death caused  dargens relationship to theon and loras recognizing that brienne did not kill renly were significant changes but maybe not so much so in the long run same with qhorin learning of jon snow on the fly but maybe it was for the better as well  theon had some killer scenes his fight for acceptance and respect really showed through as did his actual competence no one ever gives him nearly enough credit which only shows how stern the guy actually is all in all a very good episode albeit one that dares to make significant changes in order to improve on clarity in some respects it is even better than the books"
"ckal",2012-04-29,"one thing i dont get though is why they changed the way in which someone gets stabbed from the books in the first season jaime killed the mad king by stabbing him in the back instead of cutting his throat here renly dies by being stabbed in the back instead of the shadow cutting his throat hmmm"
"blasted_saber",2012-04-29,"does jaquen reference the red god in the books faceless men are supposed to revere the many faced god"
"J_Crews",2012-04-29,"loved ayras exchange with tywin anyone can be killed wow that was awesome get that young lady an emmy and a golden globe asapfingers crossed"
"Fat Mac",2012-04-29,"overall an awesome episode i liked pretty much all the scenes cool how they included dagmer too"
"blasted_saber",2012-04-29,"one thing i dont get though is why they changed the way in which someone gets stabbed from the booksin the first season jaime killed the mad king by stabbing him in the back instead of cutting his throathere renly dies by being stabbed in the back instead of the shadow cutting his throathmmmthats quite a nitpick lol"
"Jory",2012-04-29,"i liked it dont like the obvious changes they made to stannis storyline but oh well"
"Bastard of Boston",2012-04-29,"cannot believe the season is halfway over was really curious how the renlys death scene would lookcgi people did a great job with making the shadow look like stannis nice little action sequence with brienne too gwen coped well she played the scene with catelyn a little awkward thoughim trying to decide if it fits or if shes overacting a bit the scene with maisie and charles dance made this episode for me they didnt even have to speak to one another just seeing those 2 in the same room was too much awesome to filter and then tywin spoke to arya and i was all excuse me i feel like angels are speaking to me now in some language that im too lowly to comprehend not worthy glad the show made this change if only to see these two characters play off one another jaqen is perfect he combines creepy and charismatic much in the same way he can make redwhite hair look cool not that it makes it impossible for jojen and meera to ever appear but branjens dreams really clarifies months of speculation i really enjoyed brans rag tag group though ill be really sad if we dont see them all together small but great detail was rickon smashing the walnuts every bit the pintsized badass seeing the dany scenes in qarth was cool i dont necessarily think we ever got to see her try to acculturate her khalasar as we did hereunless im not remembering some details i think its here where itll be worthwhile to show she does have some queenly qualities in so much as how shes forming this completely new culture with a khalasar who blends as opposed to remain insular great seeing another dragon appearance speaking of queens i dont want to be a queen i want to be the queen meow marge cant wait for you to meet cersei pyat pree was every bit as demented as he should be should be really interesting to see how they handle the house of the undyingit was such a trippy sequence and quaithe i loled the way she popped up and made you instantly disconcerted with that creepy mask is exactly how it reads in the book stop doing that woman as someone who has spent hours with the audio book it was cool seeing roy dotrice as hallyne edited by bastard of boston 29 april 2012  0937 pm"
"J_Crews",2012-04-29,"just saw the scene where brienne pledged to catelyn  i love love love brienne in thispretty much perfect  errr except she didnt do the handholding thing correctly and yes im joking im not that much of a nitpicker winkpng classbbcemoticon alt "
"Cheese Pudding",2012-04-29,"oh and what about the quaithe finally we saw her not as i imagined reading the books but very nice pyat pree too very freaky about the speed of the series my father yes i watch with him has lots os problems to memorize characters names he has no time to do it since even stannis appears not much in the episodes which are once a week so maybe thats why they cut jojen meera and the walders 4 more characters for the audience it was a nice move"
"A Time for Wolves",2012-04-29,"i loved this episode my favorite of the season watching it again 3"
"Darth Pipes",2012-04-29,"one thing i dont get though is why they changed the way in which someone gets stabbed from the booksin the first season jaime killed the mad king by stabbing him in the back instead of cutting his throathere renly dies by being stabbed in the back instead of the shadow cutting his throathmmmgood point perhaps stabbing in the back just comes across better on the show visually otherwise im not sure why that was changed"
"Bran the Bummer",2012-04-29,"does jaquen reference the red god in the booksfaceless men are supposed to revere the many faced godhe does this is the second reference too so it looks like theyre dumbing the show down on that point as well not so terrible but i feel like it was a needless cuteta  he references the red god in the books too perhaps noob edited by bran the bummer 29 april 2012  0927 pm"

"Lord Godric",2012-04-29,"i also have to say how brilliant they made pyat pree and qaithe both entirely creepymysterious and leaving me wanting more im glad they didnt cut the house of the undying bit because i think that is the climax of danys entire story across all 45 books"
"J_Crews",2012-04-29,"jaqen hghar was exactly how i pictured him in the booksme as well"
"Qwop22",2012-04-29,"this was my favorite episode this season by far no unecessary sex scenes or made up nonsense that wastes screen time the exchange between tywin and arya was brilliant maisie is awesome and that look she gave him as she said any man can be killed that sent shivers down my spine i thought the qarth scenes were very well done and was thrilled to see pyat pree introduced and the house of the undying mentioned renlys death could be viewed as cheesy but its cgi what do you expect i thought it was handled very true to the book brienne killing the guards was awesome and when she offered herself to cat later was very moving theons further embarrassment was amusing having theon not know who dagmer is doesnt really bother me hes such a small character its not important to inform the audience he was previously known its kind of disappointing he isnt missing part of his jaw but thats to be expected i loved how they laid the groundwork for margaery to come back and become engaged to joffrey it was a much need pov from her to see how determined she is to become queen it also shows how littlefinger will be the one to broker the alliance the wildfire scene was done exceptionally well for those saying why did they make it cerseis idea well in the books it is her idea cersei has been habing them secretly make wildfire until tyrionmfinds out and then takes over they nailed the casting of the pyromancer the casting in the show is always unbelievably good i cant wait to see the chain be thrown in there im not sure how i feel about davosnbeing the reason melisandre is left out of the battle of blackwater but meh whatever it gives an explanation for him being in the leading attack of the ships the actor playing stannis is getting better and better with each episode the one gripe i have with this episode the fist of the first men it was not in the middle of the mountains it was a high hill surrounded by dense forestry i suppose they made it look like it was in the frostfangs for more wow factor it definitely looks harsher and more dangerous however it looks near impossible to barricade i cant wait to see qhorin and jons scouting adventure and the introduction of ygritte and rattleshirt ok i lied i have another gripe wtf is with making jojens green dreams come from bran and it appears osha knows about the three eyed crow beyond the wall this really makes me worry about jojen and meera ever showing up in the series the way it seems its going we will probably see osha lead bran north im not sure what will happen to rickon then"
"J_Crews",2012-04-29,"i thought it was a good transitional episode theres a new boss or bosses in town and thats the series writers theres a lot of consolidation simplification and plain old skipping of scenes and characters i still love the series although it is different from the books in some aspects they still keep the spirit of the books even if they dont follow the letter exactly agreed im very happy with what theyre doing could it be better of course could it be much much worse absolutely"
"Lord Godric",2012-04-29,"i dont have a problem with what they did with margerys character because i honestly believe she had to have been that ambitious in the books were just getting a first hand look at iti prefer the way they are showing margaery like you said she probably was also this ambitious in the books too we just didnt see her and this schemingambitious character will be so much more fun to have in kings landing later on"
"Darth Pipes",2012-04-29,"was also glad they included the religious folk on the streets decriding joffrey"
"J_Crews",2012-04-29,"a rickon signing which was pretty funny i was hoping bran would ask the lord having the audience to kindly wait a moment snatch a knot in his creepy little ass and have one of the guards haul him bodily out of there i guess next episode will end where theon says hes going after winterfellwinterfell will fall in the next ep"
"dtones520",2012-04-29,"just remember that this is an adaptation the ultimate story is being told and told excellently yes there are minor changes there has to be budget things making sense to nonbook readers not having too many characters to remember etc are all things that the people making the show have to consider david and dan are huge fans of the books im sure they would include everything if they could but it probably just wouldnt work on tv in the end overall my favorite episode so far"
"Fez",2012-04-29,"thats from the booki obviously defer to you on the matter and its been quite a while since ive read acok but i honestly dont remember him ever saying i or youshame that he goes from a 10 on the badass scale to a 99 if youre gonna have a cool verbal tic that makes you completely distinct you gotta stick with it"
"Ran",2012-04-29,"house snowbc brienne was the badass instead of loras or bc it didnt look like stannisno problem with brienne fighting well  thats what happens in the book  but i do note that her killing those men is rather early where its something of a big deal when she finally does kill her first manbut the failure to make the killing match the eeriness of the shadow birth was a big surprise and i think it largely has to do with the lost monster entry the rather mediocre direction and so on i think had it been done more as in the book in this particular case it would have worked better i actually think they had intended to do it that way at some point  notice how superbly clear renlys shadow is against the tent wall but they then went another direction i guessas to loras thats also a part of it  its not that he goes badass its that he rages and kills his sworn brothers in his grief its the emotion of it and the tragedy as it affects loras that doesnt really get conveyed with anything like the power of what martin mentions in a couple of lines this is stuff that haunts the loras tyrell of the novels but it just doesnt existwould it have been hard to have loras spattered with the blood of two guards that killed because they stood outside shouting for help rather than running inand why did they decide to have him know that brienne didnt do it im baffled by this sort of thing to be honest they literally gave finn jones the scene where loras accuses brienne for his audition  because hey good scene with a lot of emotion in it  and then they go to something well boring oh wasnt brienne must be stannis if they feared that they needed them to settle on stannis quickly to motivate the tyrells jumping to the lannisters why not just have him suppose that brienne did it at stanniss behestanyways i had really looked forward to the killing and it was only okay i had really looked at their taking those couple of lines and really giving loras tyrell that moment of rage and grief on the screen in the way that the tv show can do because its not wedded to a pov structure and they didnt do it it was disappointingre jaqenfrom the bookthree lives you shall have of mewhy he slips out of the tick just then who knows grrm may have slipped himself or perhaps theres some meaning to itas to the red god yes jaqen repeatedly refers to rhllor because he rorge and biter were going to burn alive if arya didnt help so she stole their deaths from rhllor the firey aspect of the many faced god edited by ran 29 april 2012  0936 pm"

"Darth Pipes",2012-04-29,"i think this episode did jump around a lot but id argue that the previous two were actually very focused i think this episode served as a falloutsetting up point for the next five episodes it certainly seems like the next one in particular will be somewhat focused around theonwinterfell and reaction plus jon in the north and i get the feeling stannisdavos may not even be in the next episode considering they are consolidating the armyi definitely see what you mean thoughi was a little disappointed with the actual shadow creature and i was fully expecting it to come out of renlys shadow perhaps it would have cost too muchthat said the build up for someone who has read the book and knows what is going to happen was intense in that scene and my heart was in my throati dont have a problem with what they did with margerys character because i honestly believe she had to have been that ambitious in the books were just getting a first hand look at iti miss jamie but thats because his character doesnt really get to flourish until the third books anywayarya maisie is tremendous and the scene with her and tywin was definitely my favoritethe dany scenes dont do it for me but thats because i really didnt like them in the books either till near the endwhat is everyones problem with qarth thoughthats a fair point they have been a little more streamlined and given more time for certain stories like tyrion and dany"

"Lord Godric",2012-04-29,"and why did they decide to have him know that brienne didnt do it im baffled by this sort of thing to be honest they literally gave finn jones the scene where loras accuses brienne for his audition  because hey good scene with a lot of emotion in it  and then they go to something well boring oh wasnt brienne must be stannis if they feared that they needed them to settle on stannis quickly to motivate the tyrells jumping to the lannisters why not just have him suppose that brienne did it at stanniss behestthis part definitely baffled me it didnt bother me really because it is a minor piece that doesnt change the overall story which is all i really ask for but i think there would have been better opportunities for emotional scenes down the line particularly when jaime schools loras upon their reunion in feast"
"axels15",2012-04-29,"as to the red god yes jaqen repeatedly refers to rhllor because he rorge and biter were going to burn alive if arya didnt help so she stole their deaths from rhllor the firey aspect of the many faced godi never made that connection thank you"

"Rockroi",2012-04-29,"very tight strong episodehere is what i likedthe maid of tarth brienneâ<U+0080><U+0099>s reaction to renlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death and her knightly response to cat were very big moments to the show in that moment you did not just capture the â<U+0080><U+009C>puppyloveâ<U+0080><U+009D> that brienne had for renly but that epic sense of loss and the underlying hints of failure as in she failed to protect rely later when she swears feelty to cat she does so not out of weakness but out of strength she was incredible this episodethe lord of winterfell bran stark would have made one hell of a lord great moment in the show when he sent cassel to torrenâ<U+0080><U+0099>s square thoughâ<U+0080> wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t that guy just a moment ago at oxcross bran knows what it means to have others fight for you sometimes you have to go to bat for them his is the fury from that guttural scream that killed renly to the coldhearted plan to kill the lannisters stannis baratheon is a raging storm of fury and he still listens in the books stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> greatest attribute is that he listens to wise counsel him and davoisâ<U+0080><U+0099> discussion was a point of great writing davos brings to stannis the very concerns many of us had is this stannis suddenly soft and our stannisâ<U+0080><U+0099> response fuck no this stannis listens to davos challenges davosâ<U+0080><U+0099> assumptions just as davos challenges his and in the end he listened and in the end heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s coming great scene this samwell tarly is better than the other samwell tarly when the show started i said that robert baratheon and viserys were two characters in the show that were marked improvements over the same characters in the books that group got its thrird member samwell tarly in the series is just a better character than the one in the books book sam is afraid and craven and cowardly and talks incessantly about being afraid and craven and cowardly through ever scene in the books at some point he would toughen up this sam has a lot more joy far more joi de vive than book sam this sam is a lot more interesting and a lot more realistic alla round better characterhonorable mention doloous edd is tremendous the queen for the third episode in a row maergery tyrell is burning up the screen as i have stated in it to win it sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not broken up at all about renlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s death fuck that guy a corpse rarely can become king and this one does not want to be a queenâ<U+0080> she wants to be the queen the hand and his right arm gotta love tyrion and bronn great scenes phenomenal dialog and a great understanding of how tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mind works slowly but surely he figures it all out the wildfire is what it is its dangerous and horrible and deadly and its all that stands between kl and stannis and so better to have wildfire under his own control than it would be to have it under cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s control and maybe it will keep stannis out now add to all that bronnâ<U+0080><U+0099>s incredible backandforth with tyrion and you have a great tandum and no shae and that is always a good thing honorable mention the alchemist scene was 10 kinds of winthe lion and his cup bearer i saved the best for last tywin lannisterâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dissection of arya stark and her crisp and determined parrying his attacks was epic it was good writing it was tremendous acting they discussed important issues that had real consequences and the whole timeâ<U+0080> they know each one is staring at the other with this deep introspection staring deep into the other the camera just ontop of each as they stare at the other and the whole while each one knows the other is onto them but how much who is playing who and they are deeply invested in the other almost dancingand then she says that line from the trailer anyone can be killed and sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s right but who does she mean you think she means tywin but tywinâ<U+0080> tywin knows who he is thinking about and that shit just met a girlâ<U+0080> and he liked her that scene between arya and tywin was the most intimate scene in the show and those characters never spoke a word to the other in the books yeah thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a 10 not so sure about â<U+0080>renlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s life and death i preferred renlyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s murder in the way the book had it seemed more closely cropped and tighter this version was more raw and obvious not a big deal but overall renly baratheon as a character was never what he was in the books not bad but never really good and he ended much in the way he lived always coming up short the nitpick with cersei and tyrion how come every idea that involves death either originates from cersei or joff in the books wildfire was always tyrionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s idea why not keep it that way why make cersei leap up and start that race tyrion can have bad intentions too you know that doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t make him a bad guy â<U+0080>so much for the budget so after we all got into it about danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dragons not making an appearance in the last episode to somehow excuse for the pointless dialog from the gates of qarth this episode we see dragons everywhere which i really liked but then why not just show them the dragons then i miss jaime and sansa and joff and the hound not so much a complaint because they only have so much time but i still like what i like did not likenothing this was just a solid episode back to front great stuff no

"Hear Us Roar",2012-04-30,"his conversation with cat made them sound like equals fighting together he did say robb would need to pledge loyalty to him but that clashed with the rest of his sentiments i felt like show tried to make it seem that had renly not been killed at that moment he and robb would have teamed up and saved the day in the books i never got the impression that they were that close to making a deal that robb would ever supportwell it depends if renly would have lived robb might have gone with it since he loses so much of his forces in the next book"

"The Crannogman",2012-04-30,"asha i couldnt agree more i love love love her in the books she is one of my favorites yara is a completely different character she looks nothing like how asha is described and just comes off as a spoiled brat granted asha does have some bratty moments in the book but i feel like they are really portraying her wrong and it bothers me of course im sad about no jojen and meera but i think i can live with it i really like osha in the show null"
"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2012-04-30,"i am just glad that after a really dark and depressing episode last week this episode had such a light and humorous tone with no sex scenes of any kind im glad the dd recognized that you cant just have a relentless depressing show and expect the audience to stick with it i think it was very important after last weeks episode that we have a non heavy episode to keep the casual viewers interested and its good that the show producers recognized that"

"Ghost714",2012-04-30,"my thoughts about this episode first off i am surprised they managed to do an episode without any nude scenes i didnt like how it was briennes idea to escape through the back of the tent opposed to the front in the book that was catelyns idea brienne had just got done saying she would not leave renlys body and then next second her mind is composed enough to know to go through the back where they were less likely to run into anyone i just dont think that made any sense we are suppose to believe briennes whole world just came crashing down right in front of her eyes and she just killed two people which is something she has never done so it is not very believable that she would come up with that idea especially when she didnt think of leaving thats why i think the book makes much more sense having catelyn be the level headed one the next thing i did not like and that was them making jon sound like a total brat he is not joffrey or edmure tully jon would never brag by saying i fought and killed a wight how many rangers can say that especially not to lord commander mormont i really hate what they are doing to jons character this season in the books qhorin wanted jon to go because jon had just had a wolf dream about the wildlings and he saw what they were doing qhorin also knew jon was a warg and thats why he wanted jon with him because the old powers were awakening and qhorin knew it might be nice to have a warg with him that is a son of winterfell all of that is some great stuff why would the show want to change it i mean i am not totally against change but thats only if its for the good for example in the show when ned was about to lose his head he walked past yoren and said baelor letting yoren know that arya was there at the statue of baelor and yoren then knew to take care of arya that was never in the books but even grrm said that was a great change because it was almost like one last gift ned could give to arya and grrm said why didnt i think of that so changes like that are great i have no problem with good changes like that the change with jon in the scene where he says he wants to go with qhorin that change was the opposite of the change with ned saying baelor to yoren why are they making so many nonsensical changes like that i really dont understand it they are changing things that are golden in the books to make them shit in the show this season why change the names of the guys that go with qhorin they kept stonesnake but why change squire dalbridge and ebben i could have heard the show wrong one of the names might have been ebben but i know i did not hear the name squire dalbridge when qhorin named the men that would be going to kill mance rayder i loved squire dalbridge and the history with his namebecause he was once squire to a king qhorin still had four people go with him in the show including jon so why change the names if they are going to have the same amount of people go with qhorin as in the book its like they are changing things just to be different and thats what i do not agree with another dumb change why make theon not know who dagmer cleftjaw is this is the guy who first put a bow in theons hands he basically tought theon how to walk he was more of a father to theon than balon ever was that history is way more interesting than not having a history with theon at all oh and dagmers jaw was not cleft why did they have loras thinking it was stannis that killed renly instead of thinking it was brienne i mean i know it was stannis but i swear they are trying to make stannis out to be way worse in the show than he was in the books the great thing about the books is you start out not liking a character but as the books go on you find yourself starting to like them thats how it was for me and many others when it came to stannis i am afraid though that they are making stannis to unlikeable thats it for now edit i am still not sold on yara at all everytime she smilesif you can call it that i want to cut my eyes out i will say though i am very pleased with danys qartheen wardrobe it looked appropriate and it made daenerys look stunningly beautiful i swear that is the most beautiful emilia clarke has ever looked and thats saying something because i love emilia clarke and i think she looks beautiful in everything i never thought i would get over not getting to see one of danys boobs when she should be wearing a tokar in the show but in this wardrobe it is almost ok because she just looked that good this episode imo edited by ghost714 30 april 2012  0209 am"

"dansnow",2012-04-30,"lots of changes this episode only one i didnt like was mormonts comment to jon didnt see the point im glad bran had jojens dream id rather jojen have it but since hes not here im glad it was still include superb episode"
"Shienberg",2012-04-30,"regarding meera and jojen reed i think they have to be there its possible although unlikely that they could leave bran and rickons fate hanging at the end of the season for the tv audience one thing i know for sure as that they need to have cat think the boys are dead when she sends jaime off with brienne but i could totally see them letting the viewers think that the boys were dead until next year but what is more likely is that they will emerge from the crypt at winterfell in the very last scene of the season the thing is though leuwin has to die keeping him alive would be too big of a change in my opinion and if i remember correctly its leuwins idea to split the boys up im thinking that they bran rickon hodor and osha will all leave winterfell together later as they travel early next season they will meet the reeds along the way and then take leuwins advice to split up it would be really cool if we could see the mute kid in the tree who later tells manderly about the boys and their wolves the actress who plays osha is good but not good enough to drastically change the story for her i hope dd agree"

"ace",2012-04-30,"that was a good one i thought renlys death was well done though brienne saying the shadow looked like stannis is ridiculous she mightve seen stannis once for about 30 seconds and already she can recognize his face in that black shifting smoke but what bothered me more is her saying she only got to touch him once that sounds to me like she wanted for him like sexually brienne i dont think so in winterfell it looks like bran will be having the green dreams instead of jojen give me back my reeds bawlgif classbbcemoticon altbawl  also there had to be some serious suspension of disbelief for me to accept that theon with the crew of a single ship 100 if im very generous can besiege 1 castle and take another i just dont understand this change there were no budget of time reasons for it its like change for changes sake and it isnt good change also it was funny watching yara trying to show swagger it sits on her like humility on asha i dont remember was the wildfire cerseis idea in the book too i thought that was all tyrion but i could be wrong jon in the north was good i thought tywin talking to arya like robb and the nurse in the last episode its so very hollywood though so not asoiaf i still cant help feeling that jaqen is too plain for me across the narrow sea we got another glimpse of a dragon for all of 20 seconds i guess that should last us until next season im worried the house of the undying will be chopped down to barely a hut 1 room 1 minute and shes out it was actually too long in the book but i hope they wont cut too much and who was that woman that talked to jorah i dont remember her at all in the book i continue to be impressed by how well davos is portrayed as good as stannis is bad finally no porn at all in this episode whats up with that did the snl skit get through to to them or will we be compensated by a full 20 minutes next episode"

"The Anti-Targ",2012-04-30,"i think its great that qarth seems comfortable and homey for dany at the moment funny i kinda disagree with all the disappointments from linda and elios review apart from not dooing the shadow assassin right i did think that renlys shadow on the tent moved strangely  ominously so i agree that they might have tried to do it according to the book but there was a last minute change perhaps there was some difficulty with making it look right and it was quicker to do a lostesque thing which they had to settle for due to time constraints didnt mind loras not blaming catbrienne but yeah i thought loras grief was otherwise a bit too muted he could at least have punched one of the guardsmen in the face with a mailed fist and blamed them for letting an assassin get through them so without the bloody mummers is it going to be northmen roose who capture jaime and brienne upon capture they are still loyal to robb so cut off his hand then they turn their cloak and send jaime on his merry way will they keep brienne there for jaime to come back and rescue or will they save time and send her off with jaime the more the series goes on the more they will cut for expediency and because cutting something early means whole threads unravel so minor plot lines get bent out of all recognition its interesting in cok i supported in general stannis cause but im finding stannis to be not worthy of support in the tv series if theres one plotline i think theyve done poorly its stannis and it remains one of the flaws of this episode for me stannis comes off as petulant and altogether too personally ambitious for the iron throne he should be the iron  grim hard and unyielding  that donal noye is that right describes him as in the book in the book i can see why davos is so loyal to stannis in the tv show i cant for the life of me understand why davos would be so unwaveringly loyal i thought it was a strong episode and best of season to date the other highly analytical nonprofessional watchers of the show but who know nothing of the book all breathed a huge sigh of relief that the season very much got back on track and were very glad to leave episode 4 behind interestingly i think there is a widening divergence of opinion on the merits of episodes between book enthusiasts and unspoiled nonreaders objectively i think this was strong drama but subjectively there was plenty of divergence from the book with which book fans can choose to be upset  disappointed"

"The Knight of Grasses",2012-04-30,"before reading the 20 pages of reactions here are my thoughts  this episode was a bit slow and i dont remember many really cool moments other than arya staring down tywin after she says anyone can be killed that was great  the shadow was done well i think although i was a bit uncomfortable with how much time elapsed after brienne killed the tent guards it seemed like forever until someone else approached given how much noise they made fighting wouldnt someone else have gotten there quicker oh well thats a nitpick overall i really like the way theyve done briennes character and the scene with her and cat was well done  i like the expansions theyve made on loras and margaerys characters it will be interesting to see how margaery does with playing a completely innocent young woman once they get to kings landing and while it may not have been explicit in the books there was indication that loras wanted vengeance on stannis for example he was incredibly eager to be the one to lead the attack on dragonstone probably for that reason  my guess is that osha replaces jojen and meera shes a wildling and the show has portrayed her as someone who knows about mysteriousmagical things i have a feeling a lot of people are going to be upset by this but im all for it i never got into jojen and meeras characters in the book osha is more interesting to me  tyrions scenes didnt steal the show like they have in each previous episode this season his conversation with lancel was just a bit off in my opinion too much talking over each other i did like cerseis scene which made it clear that shes willing to drink to cope with her problems the wildfire stuff was fine but are we going to see tyrion building the chain  danys scenes were okay but like in the books shes so far away from the rest of the action that i have a hard time getting into her story the dothraki arguing about how to loot the jeweled statues was pretty funny and her scene with jorah was very well done  the fist of the first men should have been in the forest i understand they have to use what geography is available to them but what the heck sense does it make to camp up on this exposed rock in the middle of open land in the book i got the sense that the fist at least offered a bit of protection from the elements this is just out there for everyone to see and for them to freeze did anyone else have a totally different picture in their head of the fist  arya is so awesome so very very awesome"

"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2012-04-30,"well its never said out loud since we dont get qhorins pov but it can be inferred from the text the first time qhorin meets jon he asks its said that a direwolf runs with you basically indicating that fact above all else interests him and when he asks for jon to come he says  the old gods are still strong beyond the wall the gods of the first men and the starks i take that as he believes that the starks supernatural connection to the old gods of which the only manifestation so far any one can see is in ghost would be of benefit and after mormont agrees to let jon go literally the first thing qhorin says to jon as they leave the tent is we ride at noon best find that wolf of yours so in very scant few sentences we see qhorin speak he bring up the wolf time and again hes clearly interested in jon because hes got stark blood and hes got ghost edited by the scabbard of the morning 30 april 2012  0245 pm"

"Fengari",2012-04-30," no problems with the looks of the shadow yes its not exactly as described in the books but thats just a matter of aesthetics it would have been weird to have a 2d shadow on the tent wall after the 3d shadow creature we saw being born the previous episode this was more consistent i do agree something felt wrong with the pacing of the scene though especially panning out to show the whole tent after all the closeups felt forced i can only imagine it is because they originally wanted to do it more like the book then changed their minds afterwards  brienne killing the guards nothing wrong with that as far as im concerned i actually think their escape from the tent makes more sense to me than cat being able to convince one of them that stannis did it after all the guards see brienne cat and a dead king magic is just reborn so it is not as if they have lived with the concept all their lives it didnt really make much sense to me that someone would believe the word of cat whos not even on their side above what they can see with their own eyes  oh wait loras obviously just made the conclusion it couldnt have been brienne and cat but had to have been stannis he didnt see the shadow or even hear about it but he obviously thinks the only thing important about solving a murder is motive circumstances and the fact that stannis is nowhere around obviously dont matter what  do you want to be a queen no  i want to be the queen great line it looks more and more like she will actually take the queen of thorns role herself instead of just being her grandmothers pawn which was how i judged her in the books i think having a strong elderly woman in the show would have been great but i do love the new margaery  at last someone in kings landing realises there might be trouble ahead i was starting to think stannis was going to have to burn his own ships still no chain though  loved tyrion and lancel in that small small carrying chair tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp  and bronns it will be my pleasure and that grin  stannis and davos this is the first time stannis feels like the real stannis to me not sure about the changes why put davos in charge of the fleet will they pin the failure on him hes even apologising in advance my time on the seas was spent evading ships not attacking them  tyrion taking a stroll through kings landing this whole scene felt wrong we see a fishmonger with crates full of fish a farmer selling fresh fruit and a stand with vegetables i thought the people of kings landing were supposed to be halfstarving and pretty hostile against their rulers in the red keep by now the guy criticising them and the few people cheering him on must be a very small minority because most of the people seem to just ignore the demon monkey as he is walking amongst them with only one guard  theon being his own arrogant self once again only to be taken down a peg by his own crew good thing he has dagmer to all but tell him what he needs to do to gain their and his fathers respect can you tell i really dont like this guy ive been on the fence about this but i am starting to like yara shes sassy and downtoearth enough to make her place amongst her men make sense  the tywin and arya scene was awesome but left me wondering why does tywin take this attitude from his cupbearer does he suspect who she really is if so what does that mean for the rest of aryas arc though i would have loved to see aryas story closer to the books some part of me likes that it has been mixed up so it leaves me wondering what will happen at harrenhal a kind of suspense i would never have felt if everything remained as in the books of course  a man looks really sexy  i hardly recognised the fist nothing at all like the description in the book but amazing scenery and ghost just being there without him actually having to be in the image because of the story did they have a little bit of budget leftover after all good exposition by sam too from him it didnt feel forced at all especially with the you read it in a book comment from ed  couldnt help but think in a castle lit by candles and fires having indirect lighting coming from behindbetween the pots of wildfire seems a bit imprudent tyrion needs to have a word with the castles interior designers as well as making men practice with the empty pots  drogon is so cute when he tries to breathe fire and only coughs up some smoke at first also yay a glimpse of a second dragon  after showing all the rather pointless nudity weve seen before hbo decides to do away with the tokar the fashion could easily have been explained in the dialogue between dany doreah and irrithe excuse of it being too distracting doesnt make sense as in the first season whole expositions were being made over whores doing each other and its not like we havent seen danys breasts before why would we be distracted by a mere bare breast and not by two girls having sex i can only think that extras willing to have one bare breast in the garden scene were more expensive than fully clothed extras  pryat pree looks creepy enough that was a good introduction same with quaithe although i really saw her mask differently  good scene of brienne swearing her loyalty to catelyn a bit strange that they are alone there yes but it is very possible that catelyns escort is a bit further away giving the women a bit of privacy  bran is learning quickly about how to be a good lord and rickon is shown for the halfwild boy he has become  looks like jojen and meeras essential plotpoints will be taken over by osha and bran i dont really mind i like osha in the show and think she can make up for meera and jojen assuming she comes with bran it makes me wonder who will be with rickon but i suppose as we dont get to see that arc that doesnt really matter that much also why did the crow become a raven  didnt care for the change to how jon gets to go with qhorin in the books it is obviously qhorin who wants him there not so much here also jons bragging about killing the wight and mormonts response about craster is a big change to their relationship gotta love sam for offering to do his friends work so he can become the ranger he wanted to be though who will find the dragonglass now  vault valyrian stone ser jorah wanting her to sail to westeros with one ship  shirtless gendry and arya notices how broad a target that would make smilepng classbbcemoticon alt   the tickler dead already makes me wonder who arya is going to kill doesnt really matter the is there gold in the village scene was great in the book but i doubt it would come over well on tv seeing how much time there is between both scenes but i hope they wont have her not kill someone i loved the tiniest of smiles on aryas face when she realises the power she has i wonder who shes going to pick next overall i liked the episode lots of changes but nothing i cant live with"

"Ghost714",2012-04-30,"well its never said out loud since we dont get qhorins pov but it can be inferred from the textthe first time qhorin meets jon he asks its said that a direwolf runs with you basically indicating that fact above all else interests himand when he asks for jon to come he says  the old gods are still strong beyond the wall the gods of the first men and the starks i take that as he believes that the starks supernatural connection to the old gods of which the only manifestation so far any one can see is in ghost would be of benefitand after mormont agrees to let jon go literally the first thing qhorin says to jon as they leave the tent is we ride at noon best find that wolf of yours so in very scant few sentences we see qhorin speak he bring up the wolf time and again hes clearly interested in jon because hes got stark blood and hes got ghostthank you so much for responding to that ridiculous ass post i was getting so worried that it was going to go unchecked for pagesqhorin definitely chose jon in the book because the old powers were awakening and he spotted jon as a warg qhorin knew having a son of winterfell would be helpful now that the old magic has woken up because the starks have the blood of the first men so the old gods are strong in them you know not to take a post seriously about how jon shouldnt have been chosen when you see the poster cant even spell the halfhands name right some expert they are i am sorry for being harsh it just makes me very angry when someone goes into some long ass rant about how jon should not have been chosen they make it so long constantly repeating themselves trying to make such a strong point and they have no idea what they are talking aboutjon getting longclaw is not some undeserved gift either yes it was jons job to try and save commander mormont but trying and succeeding are two different things jon did not just try and save mormont he succeeded at saving mormont he managed to kill the wight without getting himself or mormont killed mind you it took multiple men of the nights watch to kill the other wight named jafer flowers but not befor that wight killed ser jaremy rykkar the acting first ranger in benjen starks absence also if people want to get technical about jons job it was jons job to stay in his sleeping cell like he was ordered to jon however followed his gut and he left the cell when he opened his cell door jon found the guard that was posted to make sure he didnt leave and that guard had his head completely twisted around after seeing that most people would get scared and run for help especially most greenboys but jon is brave enough to go check on the old bear before going for help and that is what made all the difference in saving lord commander mormonts life thats another part of the reason why he deserved longclawso the old bear finds his family sword after the fire and he decides to give the sword to jon a surraget son who happened to save his life what doesnt make sense about that some people think jeor should have sent longclaw back to bear island they think that would have made more sense i dont understand that line of thinking jeor had just convinced jon that their war against the others and wildlings was way more important than jon going south to help robb fight his war so after jeor having just said that to jon people think he should be a hypocrite and send his valyrian steel sword back to bear island instead of giving it to a gifted young swordsmen who is about to go on a ranging north of the wall against the wildlings and others so how would it have made any sense for jeor to have told jon to forget about his family because they have more important things to deal with while at the same time thinking a valyrian steel sword would be of more use going south with his sister to fight the lannisters instead of going north to fight the othersoh and this same gifted young swordsman just happened to save his life on top of itthats why it makes sense that jeor gave jon longclawgods why cant people actually take their blinders off and think about something"
"Jaxom 1974",2012-04-30,"well unlike in the books no one really blames brienne everyone is just confused and doesnt know what really happenedand such is the shame of the cuts and story trimming that had to happen that brienne was made a member of renlys kingguard why not call it the rainbow guard anyway yet not knowing any of the others other than loras well thats really dampened the emotional aspect of the whole scene and having loras blame stannis rather than brienne that just takes a whole lot of sting out of her character arc after her trip with jaime pretty much everything about renly on the show has been weak possibly my least favorite aspect of the adaptationit would also seem that were not likely to get mace tyrell or any of the others to the extent that they deserve to flesh out the whole tyrelllannister alliancei think the scene in the house of the undying will be that dany goes in they cut to a different scene preferably jon blue rose and all that cut back to quarth dany comes stumbling out pyat pree goes mental jorah cuts him down later she recounts what she saw the scene is too trippy for viewers to make sense of anyway it would be like a david lynch moviefolks are being way too optomistic if we get any kind of scene in the house of the undying itll be nothing like the scene in the book too much has been altered or left out for any of the scenes to make any realistic sense any sightings of rhaegar will be lost on the non book reading audience as jons parentage has not really felt like much of a subplot at all in the show and remember the name of the television adaptation is a game of throne not a song of ice and fire to have rhaegar appear and talk about it will certainly be much more confusing the foreshadowing of the red wedding bet we dont see it television wont want to take a chance to spoil the reveal or power of it other images does it matter the house with the red door in pentos perhaps there will be new images for the show but somehow i just dont see the scene being much too much of the overall story feels neutered from the books to make as much of an impact on the show just an opinion though and i hope to be wrongas to the rest of the episode it was good but as mentioned the shadow baby fell flat when we saw a clear image of renlys shadow on the tent i thought for sure it was going to come alive and wed see things go properly instead we get some odd death eaterlost smoke monster imagery that never actually looked like stannisahenough of the griping i do i really do like the showjohn"

"halfleg",2012-04-30,"yes stannis in the books after the 2nd shadowbaby is looking bad although i dont think we are directly told that is the reason overall the writers are doing pretty well including major scenes from the book in the tv series its got to be a tremendous challenge to write something for 10 hours of tv that has so many new characters and such a convoluted plot line its one of my complaints about the books much as i loved reading them that grrm kills off so many main characters and introduces so many new ones that frankly arent that interesting its hard to keep track of the b players and certainly hard to keep a tv watching audiences attention with so many new characters jumping in all the time that said i think they could be spending a little more time explaining wth is going on my wife who has not read the books is having trouble following the storyline and i think is about ready to give up on it for example she had no idea who robb was attacking and where they could use a few simple visual devices like a fadeframe of the map or something so the viewer could get a sense of where the action was located or even subtitles with who some of the characters are though that might get annoying too like i said its a challenge im definitely not liking the icelandic setting for north of the wall majestic as it is this is supposed to be heavily forested and not nearly as desolate as all the scenes we are seeing it will be interesting to see how the future scenes of the attack upon the wall from out of the forest are handled im having a feeling the show is going to avoid the whole beric dondarrion uncat thing its just another crazy subplot that i think while cool to some readers i personally never liked this subplot and thought it was never well explained might lose the tv crowd its hard to imagine them keeping up tv interest past the red wedding unless they set up some of these characters to have more redeeming qualities tv audiences like to root for a hero there really arent many of them left by the end of the books"

"Ghost714",2012-04-30,"yeah honestly its hard for me to like him in the series either in the books i dont know he was just different especially in how he talks to davos his line about grieving renly felt halfhearted and tossed in there when in the books he has a few very heartwrenching lines to davos about it and i earnestly believe he does not know that he killed renly the whole thing with mel saying shell give him a son and then him ordering davos to go do the shadowbaby was very very very poorly written there has to have been a cut scene somewhere between one and the other im earnestly surprised there hasnt been much complaining about it but i guess no one really likes stannis like i do the show writers certainly dont  dan weiss said that stannis would make a terrible king and that he lacked humanity which  forgive me if im making a broad assumption here  i dont think george r r martin believes in an interview he had said that stannis was a righteous man in spite of everything else meh im depressedstephen dillane has probably been doing a good job with what hes been given but am i alone in thinking that the writing for stannis character so far has seemed very schizophrenic please tell me im notyour not wrongi dont like that dan weiss has made up his mind about stannis because i feel that he is wrongi just watched that clip yesterday before the new episode and i feel like they are making stannis the way dan weiss views him i dont agree with that because they should make stannis the way he is in the books that way the audience can deside how they feel about stannis most people started out not liking him and as the books went on they started to change their mindsmyself included but in the show they are making stannis far to unlikeable and i am fearing know one will change their minds about him as the show goes on in my opinion its not right for them to tell the viewers how to feel and thats pretty much what they are doing making stannis so bad instead of the awesome grey character that he is its like dan weiss judges stannis by his cover and forgot about a lot of good redeeming stuff about him that we get in the later books dan weiss saying stannis would make a horrible king in that video that did not sit well with me especially because he said renly would make a great king because i dont agree with that and it should be up to the individual to deside now people are going to be like see i told you stannis would be horrible king even dan weiss said so blah blah renly wooso i feel your frustration and its not just you"

"ghost the direwolf",2012-05-01,"yeah honestly its hard for me to like him in the series either in the books i dont know he was just different especially in how he talks to davos his line about grieving renly felt halfhearted and tossed in there when in the books he has a few very heartwrenching lines to davos about it and i earnestly believe he does not know that he killed renly the whole thing with mel saying shell give him a son and then him ordering davos to go do the shadowbaby was very very very poorly written there has to have been a cut scene somewhere between one and the other im earnestly surprised there hasnt been much complaining about it but i guess no one really likes stannis like i do the show writers certainly dont  dan weiss said that stannis would make a terrible king and that he lacked humanity which  forgive me if im making a broad assumption here  i dont think george r r martin believes in an interview he had said that stannis was a righteous man in spite of everything else meh im depressedstephen dillane has probably been doing a good job with what hes been given but am i alone in thinking that the writing for stannis character so far has seemed very schizophrenic please tell me im noti totally agree with you as much as i do not like stannis book i have to say that he has got feeling and as reader i do feel for him sometimes  renly death the peach edreic storm but this show stannis is just cold and like a puppet to mel in a way  if i can use this word "

"DragonSpawn",2012-05-01,"it was an interesting episode but the harrenhall plot is now a bit of a mystery to me although it was a bit messy in the books too so understandable i think they will have to introduce the bloody mummers and the reeds at some point soon even if it happens a bit later than in the books or im worried we may miss out on some quality scenes later down the line eg spoiler the bear pit  brans wargtraining there was a lot of the story i felt was very true to the books which was nice lf as a master manipulator is more vividly expressed in the show and it took me a while to get over the lack of subtelty that im used to in the books but i understand now sam tarley is not anywhere near as annoying as he is in the first season and the books which is amazing that dd have picked up on this samwise gamgee from lotr films was an awful adaptation from the books and i hated the pathetic character he became  so badly i dont watch the films any more because any scene with him in gets skipped sam tarley was heading that way but thankfully dd saw the error in thatthings i dont getthe vault dont get the angle here unless it is to tempt danys greed a character integritychallenge of sorts that could potentially drive dany away from qarthbronn  still wearing his scruffy sellsword clothes shouldnt he be larging it up as head of the gold cloaks and looking pimp since that was a new thing introduced a couple of episodes back  or was that tyrion decision overruled without us knowing about itdid the pyromancer mention about how wildfire works better now i dont recall thatdagmer cleftjaw is an old legend and close family friend of the greyjoys sadpng classbbcemoticon alt  they could have at least made an effort with a facial scar doesnt bode well for later war scars that characters sufferjons ghost dream i can see why it would be both confusing and expensive to do but the fist of the first men scene was very very weak because of it no obsidian no horn no hellcrow no suggestion of a connection between jon and ghost no hint of sneaky tree people hiding in the background for people to wonder about the magic was literally lost from that sceneso far im a bit disappointed not to have seen lightbringer  the hellcrow and edric storm  storms end dd really did make a massive cockup with the melisandre birthing scene and the shadow sneaking through the bars  how the hell can anyone ever make any sense of that book reader or not sadpng classbbcemoticon alt  edited by dragonspawn 01 may 2012  0803 am"
"Elfangle",2012-05-01,"i think the show is steering more and more away from the books as soon as people accept this the show becomes more enjoyable at least for me because in its own right there is nothing wrong with the series it has great actors a good background story great environments fights sex war intrigue and what not the problem is that most of us are fans of the book first and that changes the way we look at the show then again reasons why we come here in this subforum is to discuss the series and a major part of that involves comparing the books with the tvshow so here goes 1 arya choosing the tickler as her first kill makes sense from a tv perspective because he is a minor character and people will forget about him but for me it was just wrong its a direct consequence of messing up the torture scene in the previous episode by not stressing the routinous and insane questioning techniques that are branded in aryas mind which lead to her maniacal behavior at the tavern 2 renlys death was boring compared to the book in the book the things that stood out was the atmosphere right before the killing darkness catelyn getting chilles and the sheer brutality of the murder slashed throat and cutted through renlys armor loras reaction was also kind of dull in the books no matter how stubborn and childish he might seem he is still an amazing fighter and him going berserk at members of renlys rainbow guard is a testimony of that in the show he is nothing more then a whiny little brat that gets his ass whooped by brienne 3 threeeyed raven maybe it doesnt matter that much but its more proof that the tv show is side tracking 4 quaithe looks like a belly dancer not the mysterious sorceress she is ment to be and xaro xhoan daxos is not nearly as extravagant as he is in the books where are his nose chains and his teardrops and him smashing his vault door with a sword is kind of ridiculous pyat pree is not a member of the 13 why make him again all these things are not that important and can be considered nitpicking but they are a big part of the atmosphere that george has created 5 the fist of the first man is in the middle of a forest not mount himalaya i wonder how this will influence the epic battle with the wights which i think is kind of the nothern counterbalance for the battle at blackwater bay maybe not as detailled but still very important whonder how they will portray this on the screen 6 tyrion would never openly walk the slumbs of kingslanding either he is cowled and leaves at night or he has a ton of guards protecting him there are supposed to be riots and famine in the city people dont like him and would not let him walk the streets like that on the other hand i absolutely loved the mini carriage he was sitting in strangely i tend to accept some of the other big storyline changes like no roose but tywin at harrenhal one shadowbaby deat no reeds i think this is because the show clearly deviates from the actual story and doesnt try to hide it and in a sense it changes the plot the points i listed above are more devious in that they change the general feeling and atmosphere of the story"
"johnnysd",2012-05-01,"i agree though i enjoyed those characters in the book it does not make sense for the tv show especially when you have the caliber of actor of osha adding two more child actors to the show and expecting them to carry interesting dialogue with them north of the wall would just be too big of a riskjojen and meera will be in next season no reason really for them to be in this one the winterfell arc plays out basically exactly the same without them then early next season they will find bran on the road i do not think they can cut them completely because of what grrm has said about the reeds"

"pykmi",2012-05-01,"hey all a long time lurker and a first time poster herethis episode was my favourite of the series so far the scenes with brienne and catelyn arya and jaqen dannis and stavos and even the surprising new scene with tywin and arya just blew my mind renlys death may have not been as unforgettable as it was in the novel and lorass rage afterwards wasnt shown but the following exchange between littlefinger and the tyrells more than made up for that in my opinion i love seeing interactions between nonpov characters and having loras blame stannis for renlys murder makes the tyrelllannister allience make so much more sense nothing stops him from blaming brienne for the murder later even if he sees sense now the show has also made margaery tyrell such a compelling character way earlier than the books did and natalie dormer plays her so well i cant wait to see her in scenes with lena headey later in the series hopefully shell stop wearing those silly dresses thoughbut what really made this episode for me were changes that significantly improved some of the worst parts of the book1 danys storyline in qarth in the novel house of the undying was pretty much the only interesting or memorable part in all of her chapters in acok and the qarthian gown of course the whole invented backstory to the city with the garden of bones and combining all the various guilds and warlocks to the simpler thirteen has made what was essentially just another boring city in essos into an actually interesting location in the series xaro xhaon daxos and pyat pree are both way better and more interesting than their novel counterparts i wouldve wanted to see quaithe interact with dany instead of jorah but at least she looked really memorable and will hopefully later speak with dany even danys handmaidens and the actions of her remaining khalasar have become interesting in the show i really hope they can pull of the same with the storyline in meereen even the mention of the place in this episode made me cringe2 brans storyline in the novel brans interactions with little and big walder were clicha and really repetitive its like grrm was trying too hard with these child antagonists to bran while the ongoing war and his growing responsibility of winterfell and even rickon who manages to be really eerie and memorable in the series just by smashing nuts in the background make for a much more interesting story and while jojen and meera are interesting characters most of brans chapters in acok are just him either getting bullied by the freys or talking to the reeds about jojens visions etc now with all of them gone or pushed to appear later on we get brilliant scenes like the one where bran sends ser rodrik to torrhens square i just loved that approving look rodrik gave to bran and the way bran seems to be slowly growing and learning his responsibilities giving jojens greendream to bran also makes things so much more simpler at this point and that talk bran had with osha about it was really amazing to watch and that foreshadowing about the two orphan boys edited by pykmi 01 may 2012  1051 am"

that â<U+0080><U+009C>ridiculous ass postâ<U+0080><U+009D> sorry that i wrote it and that many people agree with it and that itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a very accurate portrayal of jon the series v jon the book i am also sorry that i then provided a compare and contrast analysis of the two next time iâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll just say â<U+0080><U+009C>jon rulzâ<U+0080><U+009D> and i guess that would be fine qhorin definitely chose jon in the book because the old powers were awakening and he spotted jon as a warg qhorin knew having a son of winterfell would be helpful now that the old magic has woken up because the starks have the blood of the first men so the old gods are strong in themfirst of all this is a huge leap without any foundation we have zero evidence to suggest this halfhand never talks to jon about the link he supposedly has with the wolf now was halfhand a warg himself did he study its finer points no clue we are never told nor could we ever imply as much from the info provided second if this is true its terrible story telling because it just so happens that the one warg in all the watch finds the only warg recruit in all the watch thank god they found each other third if this is true and considering how lame jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s journey has been so far i would not be surprised if this was the case than quirion is a master he found the warg ability in jon in 15 seconds amazingbut strangely we are never told this its never even implied he likes the wolf great and yet you can say with no evidence mind you that qhorin sorry i have difficulty properly spelling made up words picked jon â<U+0080><U+009C>definitelyâ<U+0080><U+009D> because heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a warg amazing there is no evidence for this but you can say it i am sorry for being harsh it just makes me very angry when someone goes into some long ass rant about how jon should not have been chosen they make it so long constantly repeating themselves trying to make such a strong point and they have no idea what they are talking aboutsorry i was only building together cogent facts with analysis evidence and persuasive points stitched together to make an argument sorry if that makes you resort to insults my bad didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know you were so sensitive jon getting longclaw is not some undeserved gift either yes it was jons job to try and save commander mormont but trying and succeeding are two different thingsokay so just find me in the nightâ<U+0080><U+0099>s watch oath where it says â<U+0080><U+009C>i shall win no gloriesâ<U+0080> except if i do something cool at the wall in which case i will totally get a sword so rare that at least one major house does not even have oneâ<U+0080><U+009D> just to bury this point jon snow 15 years old gets a sword made of the rarest steel in the realm one so rare that only a relative few swords of its kind even exist jon gets one after being on the wall for 8 weeks the lannisters by contrast the richest clan in the 7 kingdoms do not have such a sword but jon snow totaly has one see thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s my whole point jon is part of this body of men but he is always separate from it he gets to say that he will â<U+0080><U+009C>win no gloriesâ<U+0080><U+009D> and then wins glories he gets to say that he will not get rewards and then he is immediately rewarded he gets a sword a valaryian steel blade for doing his job that is a classic point from the author that says â<U+0080><U+009C>dear reader this character is special and you better like him because he is going to be a round a long time a really long timeâ<U+0080><U+009D> i wonâ<U+0080><U+0099>t even get to the part where he starts bedding a hot wilding girl and then bitches about it for 500 pages jon did not just try and save mormont he succeeded at saving mormont he managed to kill the wight without getting himself or mormont killed mind you it took multiple men of the nights watch to kill the other wight named jafer flowers but not befor sic that wight killed ser jaremy rykkar the acting first ranger in benjen starks absenceso where are their valyrian steel swords seriously why does jon get this plum gift when its stated that he is never going to be entitled to any such gifts look i think what jon did was brave and he deserves credit for his actions not a reward if he does get a reward it should be more narrowly tailored its a disproportional reward but in the realm of jon snow superhero it makes sense he has a super direwolf he is on the fasttrack to command he eventually gets elected lord commander by many men who have never met him so in the realm of the book it makes sense because jons reality is so warped and then he deserts seriously thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s the guy you gave that amazing sword to â<U+0080><U+009C>now my watch begins it shall not endâ<U+0080> until i really need to see my brother south of the wallâ<U+0080>â<U+0080><U+009D> so the old bear finds his family sword after the fire and he decides to give the sword to jon a surraget sic son who happened to save his lifesee this is my problem you call jon a surrogate and you bitched at me for misspelling qhorin people on glass walls my friend son to a man he met 8 weeks ago i mean can you see how bizarre that is how shortsighted lazy quick unearned and lame that is jon did a good act he did his job i find your argument that jonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s job was to stay in his cell to be unrealistic unconvincing poorly thought out and trivial but to be rewarded with such a prize just smacks of hollow gratification and a character that has to be advanced much faster than would be expected or understood heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s not only wearing â<U+0080><U+009C>plot armorâ<U+0080><U+009D> but heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s in the

to get that character up to speed he needs the arms for it bam he gets the valaryian sword just like that and who cares if it makes sense some people think jeor should have sent longclaw back to bear island they think that would have made more sense i dont understand that line of thinking jeor had just convinced jon that their war against the others and wildlings was way more important than jon going south to help robb fight his war so after jeor having just said that to jon people think he should be a hypocrite and send his valyrian steel sword back to bear island instead of giving it to a gifted young swordsmen who is about to go on a ranging north of the wall against the wildlings and othersthe one who had just deserted really see having the sword go to bear island makes perfect sense because the sword is only mormonts so long as he is head of that household when he stepped down it should have gone to his son or one of his 300 daughters mormont is a steward of that sword and its held in his trust for the protection of bear islandâ<U+0080> unless of course that the plot calls for him to give the sword to that cool young swordsman who is super great and has an amazing direwolf

"Rockroi",2012-05-01,"your not wrongi dont like that dan weiss has made up his mind about stannis because i feel that he is wrongi just watched that clip yesterday before the new episode and i feel like they are making stannis the way dan weiss views him i dont agree with that because they should make stannis the way he is in the books that way the audience can deside how they feel about stannis most people started out not liking him and as the books went on they started to change their mindsmyself included but in the show they are making stannis far to unlikeable and i am fearing know one will change their minds about him as the show goes on in my opinion its not right for them to tell the viewers how to feel and thats pretty much what they are doing making stannis so bad instead of the awesome grey character that he is its like dan weiss judges stannis by his cover and forgot about a lot of good redeeming stuff about him that we get in the later books dan weiss saying stannis would make a horrible king in that video that did not sit well with me especially because he said renly would make a great king because i dont agree with that and it should be up to the individual to deside now people are going to be like see i told you stannis would be horrible king even dan weiss said so blah blah renly wooso i feel your frustration and its not just youghost i disagree with you adamently about jon snow but i could not agree more with you on your evaluation of stannis and the shows conclusion that stannis would make a bad king is unwelcome misinformed and shallow its a topdown evaluation without any degree of evidence or proof stannis leader of men at war at seige and on the sea is just so  so mean that he would make a bad king we are told renly now that guy looks pretty in arnor and hes handsome and the gals like him so he must be a great king we are toldthats not how this should work give the audience the infomration and have us make up our own minds have the audiance like stannis or hate rely hav ethe audience say that tywin is an asshole or that ned stark is an amazing man why take the organiz fun out of it and replace it with fiatdriven conclusions that say dear viewer you must hate stannis and why because hes a poopyhead its not proper storytelling the reader should ecide for him or herself what to like or what to hate me christ i like stannis how screwed up is thati find the shows drive to conclusions instead of organic groundup discovery to be heavyhanded unwelcome and unnecessary let the people decide not the misinformed heads of state edited by rockroi 01 may 2012  0713 pm"

"Rockroi",2012-05-01,"i agree but to be fair i think theyre playing him up as a shitheel so that his faceturn means more later the same way they forcefully endeared renly to the viewers in order to make his death mean somethingyeah that is almost assuredly true i think that makes sense and when you think about it the books also capitalized on all that"
"Elfangle",2012-05-01," rockroi you really dont like jon do you everything you accuse jon of is practically the same for dany and tyrion and that is perfectly understandable because george has a role set out for them they cant stay insignificant characters jon needs to get a valyrian sword and become lc in the same way as dany needs to get dragons somehow and tyrion has an affinity with dragons and leaves westeros there are so many things these 3 people acquire and get away with because that is needed for the story to develop is that a bit unrealistic off course it is but it is also necessary else we would still be stuck with a powerless khalesi a powerless steward and a dwarf stuck in his fathers army as for jon getting the mormont sword the old bear obviously likes him and how can you judge that saving his life is not enough for him to give the sword maybe mormont likes to be not dead and this is his way of thanking a men with a bright future in the nw why did catelyn released jaimy knowing very well it would create huge problems for her son why did rob marry jeyne knowing very well it would humiliate the freys all these decisions are not based on logics and reasoning and what is realistic or not they are inpulsive and based on emotions why would it not be possible for mormont to identify with jon the man has been on the wall for ages he must miss his family he oviously had his reasons for not sending the sword to his daughters else he would have done it him knowing that the others are coming is a viable reason his duties are to protect seven kingdoms so giving a strong asset to someone who will play an important role in that cause is very reasonable why is jon being chosen by the halfhand so strange all you do is wipe arguments that others are making from the table but you do not come up with any arguments from your side why it would make sense for the halfhand to allow jon to accompany him after jon asks himself to me the scene in the tv show just means that the halfhand did not even considered taking jon with him so why would he then suddenly accept him along because jon stated he killed a wight please if there is one guy that doesnt care about bragging its qhorin there is no place in his team for people who are full off themselves so him choosing jon on hos own initiative makes more sense to me because he did it for a reason and there are plenty of reasons although you shot each down first jon has a freaking dire wolf they are suppose to live beyond the wall so having one would be a great asset second although qhorin would not care about bragging he probably knows that jon killed a wight this tells him that jon has plenty of courage does his job as a member of the nw can handle himself in such a situation and is a fast thinker its the kind of man you would want for such a mission third he knows jon is a stark with all the crazy stuff going on with the others jons blood and connection to the old gods and the cotf might come in handy qhorin is practical and any aspect no matter how small that might help their mission or improve their chances at survival is an asset to him jons heritage could play a role no matter how insignificant  same goes for ghost who is a pretty huge asset and fourth i think qhorin knew benjen stark he knew the man benjen was and then you have his nephew there might be some emotional connection to besides the pure practical one"

"J_Crews",2012-05-02,"im not arguing with you because youre clearly right in that it mattered to them who had a drop of targaryen blood in their veins but why the heck does a culture strong in thousands of years of their own history decide the targaryens are the only royalty by divine right after a few hundred years they dont even seem to have much of an impact on westeroseverybodys still speaking the common tongue outside of kl and dragonstone the targaryens dont seem to have actually built anything ive been told theyre responsible for the opening up trade and the kingsroad i dont know how accurate that is but at least the kingsroad makes sense since it comes out of kl but its not even a clearly valyrian road like the one tyrion travels on in dance its a freaking dirt road i dont see people travelling down that dirt road and reflecting on how amazing the targaryens are in their magnificence to create a dirt road where once only dirt stoodnearly all the great monuments and castles come from before the targaryens came around and despite all the other mistakes robbs being king of the north to me is making the most sense maybe it was the greatjon pointing it out but someone certainly did the dragons are gone piss on them and lets get back to our ways its only because they were the ones to unite the seven kingdoms into one nation"
"J_Crews",2012-05-02,"im very interested in the whole who is king discussion going on here but the thruth is that even all of the contenders stannis renly joffrey are usurpers dany still by all laws and regulations the rightfull queen of westeros the reason why robert wanted all the targs death is very important off course there is his personal vendetta against rhaegar but he also has political motives as long as there is a targ alive his claim to the throne will never be absolute and he will be a usurper the targs were the first ruling dynasty of the 7 kingdoms and no revebellion succesfull or not will change that a new dynasty can only begin when there is no targ left anymore it doesnt matter whether robert had a blood connection with the targs as long as dany is alive she will be the rightfull queen and viserys even before her if all the houses and people in whole westeros would kneel before robert they would all be traitors the only other option would be when the heir of an house kneels before the usurper and therefore denounces his own claim to the throne none of the targs did this thruth be told they might not have the chance since they were all killedstannis is off course being hypocrite since he thinks that according to all laws and regulations he is the rightfull king while he should know that that claim can only be made by dany only when she dies will he be the rightfull king if dany would give birth to a child her claim would automatically pass on to that child  off course whether she can have a baby is not surethe fact that dany is still alive means that stannis his claim is just as weak as renlys renly has exactly the same amount of right to become king as stannis off course this is just the pure theoretical partthere is a huge difference between being the theoretical king and the actual king the one that holds the power but since renly at the point had a far stronger force than stannis that makes him the more succesfull usurper of the twoim just trying to show that stannis is a hypocrite he is hiding behind rules and laws while those same rules and laws make him as much as a king as they do with renly or joffrey youre correct on a philosophical level but an absent ruler can only retain their rule if their place is held by rocksolid supporters no straightup targaryen has been seen in westeros is nearly 2 decades so their claim is moot whether it is technically legal or notrichard the lionheart didnt remain king of england while he gallivanted around the middle east and france for a decade simply because it was his birthright he remained king because william marshall 1st earl of pembroke royal regent and widelyconsidered among the greatest knight to ever live  held the center with backing from the kings mother eleanor of aquitaine an irascible force in her own right otherwise some ambitious man with a thimblefull of royal blood and a halfway decent army wouldve easily taken richards crown"

"James Arryn",2012-05-02,"have you actually read any of the english history from which gm took his inspiration serious question not being sarcastic because im trying to see where youre coming from with your modern ideas of what feudalism actually meant in the middle ages there have been very few instances in the long 1000 plus years history of rulers of what is now the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland in which power didnt pass smoothly from father to son or father to grandson or occasionally uncle to nephewonce william the conqueror set himself on the throne in 1066 there have been less than half a dozen unique incidents involving either an outright rebellion or a war between claimants to the throne1  matilda and stephen following the death of her father his uncle henry i matilda should have been queen but she would have been the first female ruler and the barons werent so sure about that so stephen went for the throne his reign was short and resulted in him accepting matildas son as his heir2  simon de montforts barons rebellion against his brotherinlaw henry iii which centred around henry being pissed off at de montfort using his name to secure a loan from european bankers and used it as an excuse to try and get rid of him and his fellow barons who were seeking reform in the way in which the country was governed by the king in his one year long de facto reign de montfort called the first recognisable version of a parliament3  one long period of history starting from the fact edward ii was a dick and unfit to rule in which the descendants of edward iii fought over who had the senior claim to the english throne  called the war of the roses and oddly enough one of the main inspirations from which george martin draws his ruling families and the five kings war in westeros3a  henry vii seizes the throne from richard iii to basically end the war of the roses4  the duke of northumberland john dudley tries to put his daughterinlaw lady jane grey on the throne instead of mary i his excuse being that he doesnt wish to see england return to the catholic faith and because neither did edward vii and theres no suitable male heirs in the tudor line5  the exiled stuarts two failed rebellions in 1715 and 1745 unlikely to succeed because theres been a german born king on the throne quite successfully now for a period of more than 50 years also no longer technically in the middle agesso yes in the more than 1000 years history of english rule pretty much every succession bar these few have passed without any incident and without barons failing to swear allegiance to the crownnone of this includes the englishwelsh or the englishscottish conflicts they are not based on feudal fighting but sovereignty over another countryunder any version of primogeniture and sovereign law stannis has the senior claim over renly1 cant type well will be brief2 your lumping is pretty broad for example the wor you cite as 1 but that covers a 30 year period not constant but that far apart and includes several distinct assertions or claims if you line several 30yearseveralclaim periods together you have a lot the anarchy was another couple of decades considering the time spanlets be generous and call it 750 yearsthe fact that your incomplete list alone accounts for upwards of 70 years of conflict just decidingi wouldnt call english feudalism a prime example of a well oiled mechanism3 but examples you omitted top of my headrobert vs henryhenry bolingbrokehenry iis sons vshenry iiisabellaedward iii1st baronial revolt j lacklandmagna cartaim sure there must be morethats a pretty hefty chunk edited by james arryn 02 may 2012  1152 pm"

"Fengari",2012-05-06,"i know im a bit late with this but heres my 2 cents on the best claim and better king debate it seems some people cant differentiate between who has the best claim to the throne and who would be the best king in medieval feudal society nobility titles were hereditary and claim had nothing to do with capability or popularity just as capability and popularity have nothing to do with each other judging by modern politics so of the five kings who has the best claim to the iron throne lets keep in mind that dany who arguably has the best claim hasnt come forward to actually claim it yet 1 joffrey he is the oldest son of the recently deceased king yes we know he isnt legitimate but as long as cersei doesnt come forward to confess there is no way of proving that you know no dnaanalysis yet actually im quite sure throughout history there have been a few successions where the heir wasnt actually a legitimate son with all the arranged marriages i dont think it is far fetched to assume that some most queens had their little loveinterests on the side as long as those were kept out of sight of the public im also quite sure their kings wouldnt actually care about that 2 stannis if joffrey being illegitimate could be proven somehow and tommens as well next in line is the kings eldest brother which means in his eyes being sure of the truth about joffrey and tommen stannis has a legitimate claim 3 renly comes after stannis whether you accept joffrey as the legal heir or not i dont think he ever claims it as his right either he just figures if there is going to be chaos and war concerning the succession he might as well have a stab at it and backs it up by saying at least i would be popular 4 robb no way but then again he doesnt claim it either he just wants to kick the lannisters of it after what they did to his father he does have a claim to the title that he claims or that was claimed for him though im quite sure if things had gone a different way he would have had no problem bending the knee to whichever baratheon ended up on the throne if that was the end result maybe with king of the north as his title as opposed to the warden of the north of his father if his role in taking the throne was significant enough 5 balon again no way but neither does he claim it he just sees an opportunity to take what isnt his in the chaos that has become of the seven kingdoms as the old ways of the ironborn dictate so who would make the better king joffrey i guess thats obvious no way another mad king in the making stannis debatable i dont think he would be a truly bad king he is rather proud of being just and being just is not a bad thing in a king but his idea of justice is rather hard and unbendable and being popular is not on his agenda i can see the occasional conflict arising and being ruthlessly put down a peace under tension for the kingdom at best renly in the books he is described as a younger version of robert their reasons for taking the throne might be different roberts was righteous indignation at the acts of the mad king and his son renly is just being opportunistic i think the result will be the same a king more interested in putting on the king show than in actually ruling a country which means his reign would stand or fall according to who he chooses to be his hand and thus the actual ruler we can only hope that because renly likes to be popular he would choose someone who would do a good job robb being his fathers son i think he would have been a good king ned as a lord appears to have been someone with honour someone who didnt disregard the common people and someone who realised a title brings duties as well as rights and it is clear he did his best to pass on those values to his sons there is nothing in the books to indicate robb wouldnt follow his father in his footsteps except that well he doesnt get the chance balon no not even for his own islands come on what is this guy thinking though the ironborn may well like going back to the old ways of plundering and pillaging for a while he should know by now that westeros will not take that anymore eventually things will settle down there and whoever sits the iron throne or an alliance of the different kingdoms if it comes down to the seven falling apart will come to put him in his place again and i doubt this time they will be happy with a bent knee and just one hostage"
"Lyana",2012-05-08,"this episode was really good it had a powerful start and the storyline was kept intact the depiction of renlys dead was ok not very impressive but still had an impact on me im still not sure about if the role of littlefinger is properly portrayed in the show but i guess it is easier for the viewers to understand the constant change of alliances when there is only one person responsible for that the tyrionlancel scene was hilarious bronn is still awesome stannis is getting more convincing with every episode my personal favourite in this episode  arya and her line anyone can be killed this girl is the best her interaction with charles dance is amazing they are to become my favourite tandem on the show and jaquen is also great did not really liked that the tickler was killed that way but i guess polliver could serve the same goal catelyn and brienne also had a very good scene i can see those two workin it out very well qhorin was also ok see how jons storyline will go on im pretty positive about that want more ghost and more direwolves i was a little confused by the scenes with dany drogon looks awesome but i didnt get the whole dothrakiissue hope this becomes more clear in the upcoming episodes"

"Tewks44",2012-04-29,"wow what a fantastic episode favorite so far in season 2 scenes with tyrion and the wildfire were well done all of aryas scenes goosebumps and nerdchills galore i really like how bran has turned into the lord of winterfell and is now making his own decisions and not just relying on maester luwin to do everything for him danys storyline is great too although im not a really big fan of the dynamic going on with her handmaidens danys story in qarth is interesting enough without throwing in the distraction of two of danys handmaidens disagreeing about whether or not dany should be qartheen or dothraki overall total awesomeness this is the first episode i thought worth of a 1010 edit a minor quip was how renlys death was handled it wasnt poorly done by any means in fact it was quite well done but the book did it sooo much better imo just the image of renlys shadow drawing a sword and then renly muttering cold right before dying would have been so cool but once all is said and done renlys death scene was still very emotional and i think had i not read the books i would have been perfectly satisfied edited by tewks44 29 april 2012  1147 pm"

"NW Deserter",2012-04-30,"i am honestly confused as to how some of you are saying we need to divorce it from the books there really just hasnt been that many major changes the biggest ones i can think of littlefinger going to renlys camp makes sense just because hes absent almost all of acok cant do that with a highlypaid actor and very intriguing character arya being tywins cupbearer i was skeptical of this at first but when it makes for emmyworthy scenes like tonights i can excuse it qarth and danys entourage have changed somewhat but really i just dont think those changes will snowball the characterization is still there and in some cases doreah xaro is much more interesting no jojen or meera this is probably one of the more legitimate gripes but its one of those things where we just need to keep reminding ourselves that its a tv show with a finite budget and youve got to cut corners where you can the writers have excelled here in picking up the slack by making bran a much more powerful character no riverrun or tullys  similar to the last point probably the one im most worried about but given how all the rest of the changes have been handled brilliantly by the writers i have confidence in the team other than that there have been little changes here and there due to the change in structure point of view versus thirdperson audience pacing characterization and of course budget im not trying to attack those who are disappointed with the adaptation side of the series just trying to understand where the biggest gripes are coming from cause for the most part im agreeing with the changes that are being made"

"The Anti-Targ",2012-04-30,"best of season so far dont really mind any of the changes and only sad that we have no reeds quite happy for loras not to blame brienne its a subplot that goes no where in the book and actually shows loras has some smarts brienne left because she thought shed get the chop and her loyalty was to renly not tyrell baratheon or anyone else so shes pledged fealty to cat and thats as far as it needs to go only thing that irked me was dany with her handmaidens they were altogether too familiar but it was a small thing i swear the best episodes are the ones with the least ta because that leaves space and time for real narrative and drama i dont necessarily want got to become pg but ill trade explicit sex scenes for quality drama any day of the week 810 a big improvement on ep4 and very hopeful for the rest of the season edited by the antitarg 30 april 2012  0551 am"
"The Monkey",2012-04-30,"i voted 7 but in retrospect maybe it deserves an 8 the negatives the scenery in qarth was flawless but the narrative just wasnt smooth the renly death scene and its aftermath was a bit underwhelming i missed loras killing the rainbow guard as that action said so much about his character im bummed that the tickler died so early as now they have changed one of my favourite scene in all the books where arya stabs him in book 3 while screaming out his questions the positives tyrion is a champ as always aryatywin and aryajaqen were amazing great acting brienne is awesome dont mind the changes in brans storyline the fist of the first men is terrific fucking amazing location they found in iceland no ros or shae biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd  no tits at all this episode think its a series first"
"The Meeraculous Third Reed",2012-04-30,"pretty good generally good acting all round but mega kudos to maisie williams also i like the fleshing out of margaery at this early stage i dont mind the halfhand being short and i understand the need to flesh out qarth a bit so ill let these minor things slide a few minor gripes asha this character could not be more of a fail dagmer only because to me he is finchy from the office no reeds sadpng classbbcemoticon alt  though i have read somewhere they will enter in season 3 a solid 8"

"hulyen",2012-04-30,"best episode so far not as boring as the first episodes of season 2 im bummed that the tickler died so early as now they have changed one of my favourite scene in all the books where arya stabs him in book 3 while screaming out his questionsjust realized this thats one of my favorite arya book scenes as well i hope theyll make up for it by adding a new scene or something to show aryas badass killing"
"bikie",2012-04-30,"my favorite episode of the year so far but i do echo the underwhelmed sentiment with regards to renlys death it seemed rushed and not nearly the event it should have been i liked how it was handled in the book with the shadow and the people in attendance much better the scenes with arya were amazing just amazing tyrion was on top of his game as usual and i loved the scenes with jon the only true letdown was qarth i just did not find any of it interesting at all save for the amazing cgi with the dragon"
"hoelk",2012-04-30,"awesome except for the crappy cgi shadow i really wished they would have done it with a bit more style"
"Mr. E",2012-04-30,"i am hoping little finger is doing what was behind the scenes in the book  arranging the tyrell  lannister hookup and gd knows what elseim almost as positive of this as i can be without being intimately involved in the show and im surprised that people havent caught onto the fact that this is where the narrative is heading the writers have managed to get littlefinger to bitterbridge while allowing lf to deliver neds bones and have a scene with catmasterful writing tbhgave this one a ten best of this season loved everything about it a little surprise to me was the final scene in qarth where jorahs love becomes more apparent and dany finally catches onto his feelings for herbut then again im a sap for romance so"
"TheEvilKing",2012-04-30,"gave it an 8 really solid episode without anything super epic good bits  everything involving arya tywin and jaqen are superb it was also maisies best performance this season i enjoyed her reminiscing about syrio  the winterfell scenes were good  the nights watch scenes were also very strong  tyrions scenes were as always gold another strong performance from lena headey glad they gave bronn a bit more to do than spout oneliners were starting the build up to the blackwater folks  stannis was amazing this episode i wasnt sure about him at first but hes getting better and better  i liked the scene with lf and the tyrells not so good bits  i was looking forward to quaithe but her appearance here was a little underwhelming  the catbrienne scene seemed a bit awkward  dagmer this guy isnt a badass reaver"
"zippypoodle",2012-04-30,"whos the troll who always votes one fess up"
"Jory's Shade",2012-04-30,"every week the show gets better it builds momentum and interest in the epic just like cok did for asoif it makes me very optimistic about how this season will wrap up and what we will get for sos which i hope is 14 episodes"
"zippypoodle",2012-04-30,"i think it was a good hour of tv if you can some how manage to completely divorce it from the books in that light it is probably an 8 or 9 as an adaptation it is probably a 3 to 4 the changes are starting to really add up and by next season this may just be a tv show inspired by the song of fire and ice series rather than an adaptation of it i have to get some sleep so i will have to save my more in depth thoughts for lateri bet you cant name a single change of any importance whatsoever"
"Greyjoy67",2012-04-30,"acting is again superb but they need to try and throw in at least one bit of action per episode  too many two person scenes can get stale in a row they missed a trick with robbs battle last episode and this episode they could have at least shown stannis ride in a little majestically atm stannis is still just there a little bit weve not seen him give his troops any speeches for example whereas weve seen renly robb etc do so he needs to be a bigger presence as the main new proantogonist prontagonist in the series but yeah more scale needed  i liked the scene where jon sees qhorin in the distance because it seemed really authentic being filmed in iceland i understand that theyre focusing on character and this is a tv series but there were a few shots in the first series that were just there to take your breath away and remind you hey this is westeros eg first glimpse of the wall riding up to the eyrie etc theres not been quite as many of those shots other than all that  id give it an 89 again lots of fantastic performances and i found renlys death to be well done also loved isaac and maisies performances again oh that scene with aryatywin yesyesyesyes"
"koifishkid",2012-04-30,"i thought this episode was great ive been enjoying the show a lot more since deciding to evaluate it on its own rather than insisting that everything be exactly as it is in the books tv is a different medium that the novel and things that make sense for one dont always make sense for the other"
"Lors' Edrick",2012-04-30,"best episode so far gave it a rating of 8reasons for liking itthe death scene for renly was great although we had a certain missing armor piecethe fealty scene with cat and brienne was very well done and meaningfulstannis and davoss discusssion about the lady mel shored up the reason for not taking her to battle of blackwater although it does seem odd admiral davos seaworththe site of ghost stand fiercely in the background at the fist of the first menthe halfhands introduction already a legendphats introduction thats one creepy youknowwhatdany beginning to communicate with your fierciest dragon the cgi was very niceany battle of words scene with tyrion and cersieoh heck ill give it a 9 for said reasons"
"WinterWarrior",2012-04-30,"i thought this was the best episode yet  and gave it a 10 i just loved it all of it and thought jaqen arya tywin and gendry shirtless were all excellent i really like jaqen briennes agony over seeing renley killed was very moving  christie is a great actress and i hope she gets nominated for an emmy next year i guess she did not have enough air time to make it this year and catelyn was excellent as well i was so relieved there were no ros scenes and no time wasted with prostitues and sex scenes that dont mean anything i really like how much of the book was covered in this episode and how the story was moved along and the less i have to see of cersei the better that actress and that character really get on my nerves iceland was breathtaking and a perfet place to film north of the wall those scenes were excellent and i too loved the shot of ghost on the fist of first men in the background i just loved this episode from start to finish i would like to see rhaegon and visyrion though drogon is the only dragon getting air time the three should be flying around the room and sitting on dany by now edited by winterwarrior 30 april 2012  0730 am"
"Greywolf2375",2012-04-30,"some people just love to bitch and moan learn to ignore it and youll be happier some people are just never going to be satisfied with the series because they expect it to be exactly like the books regardless of the fact that the producers are trying to fit a 1000 page book into 10 50 minute episodes they want every line and every miscellaneous unimportant side character to be included or this show is a total flopcan you really show any post that says that it needs to mirror the books exactly otherwise it will be a total loss"
"rmanoj",2012-04-30,"810i really enjoyed this episode its definitely the best of the season so far most of the changes make sense  i only have a few minor quibblesthe whole theon scene seemed a bit over the top to me with his crew randomly taking the piss out of him didnt like dagmer cleftjaw and the less said about yara the betterthe bit with qhorin halfhand was slightly off the old bear came across as too passive and strangely jovial and not really the man in charge jon was obnoxious and the fist of the first men didnt look like much of a fortifiable defensive position and is everything north of the wall supposed to be so completelyfrozen in the books i had the impression that that only really applied to the lands of always winterthe changes to renlys death felt unnecessary with brienne actually killing people rather than loras going berserk"
"Hour of the Wolf",2012-04-30,"4 im surprised by the high level of approval for this episode this episode was going to be the true test for gwendoline christie and i think it is clear that she will not be very good she looks the part and that fight scene in the tent was great but her acting is painful to watch it was going to be a hard role to pull off so i am not surprised but it still has to be said that brienne is a failure so far the shadow at the end of the last episode got me really excited and then fizzled with renlys death in this episode bronn is still very good but i think tyrion is not as entertaining as i was hoping acok is tyrions book and he has yet to take over he really took control in the book but he only seems to be a side show so far the tickler becoming one of the deaths was brutal absolutely killed one of the best moments i was waiting for in asos at the inn i dont mind changes but my favorite arya moment has no chance of happening now"

"SerArthurHeath",2012-04-30,"8 was pretty good but a few things were off great acting all around and the changes were mostly pretty good imo some characters personalities are different but the changes fit the most annoying thing was jons storyline i thought the way in the book was far better and this version of lord mormont seems like an absolute jackass and why the hell would you camp in a place that whilst only being attackable from one side is practically impossible to escape from against a much larger army"

"zippypoodle",2012-04-30,"loras not even suspecting brienne of killing renly when he is convinced she did it in the books and they even did his casting based on the confrontation from feast loras also killed two of his sworn rainbow guard brothers in rage who were guarding outside the tent where here is talked down from hurting an unarmed littlefinger who is starting wedding negotiations with margeary over renlys corpsebriennes first slaying of a man wasnt until feast where she slayed several of the guards hereultimately it doesnt matter what loras believes because brienne escapes either way i think they are setting up the tyrells joining the lannisters rather than stannisbecause loras believes stannis did it minor change that helps the writers out a lot i cant imagine why loras killing kings guard members matters in the long run or when briennes first kill occurs both irrelevant changes and margerys negotiations fit well with this margery who is willing to do whatever she needs to do to be queen and is frankly more interesting that book margery and to the point the negotations occur so who cares when none of these are important changesdavos is made admiral of stanniss fleet where imry florent the queens brother who has no experience as an admiral leads the attack on blackwater bay while davos will no doubt be made to make the same mistakes in the show in the book davos is the one pointing out the mistakes ser imry is making in being over confident and not sending out any scouts or noticing the tower which holds the chain also ser imry keeps saladors ships back because he does not trust them when davos feels this was a waste as these were some of the most experienced war time sailorsthey cant keep every lord and peasant with a minor part this is no more an important change than subbing bron for bywater as commander of the gold cloaks and they already set the stage for davoss orders being ignored by knights and lords who wont follow a smuggler stannis

their raiding target where in the books theon is the one convincing himthat first part is a matter of opnion i think shes fine secondly although cleftjaw floats the idea of doing your own thing theon will doubtless be the one with the plan plus it fits better with the somewhat more sympathetic character showtheon is minor minorchangesthe cliff side approaches of the tv fist of the first men will

could not be refused with xaros being one of her dragons one has to wonder if dany might not have considered xaro more seriously for marriage if she thought he had any interest in her what so ever especially when he makes it seem much more so than the books that he would support her war effort they also made jorah mormont seem like he was against bringing any foreign aid to conquer westeros when it was his idea to get the unsulliedxaro isnt gay as an imporant plot change banggif classbbcemoticon altbang   hes still interested in dany for a reason other than romance so the essence is the same and the unsullied part hasnt happened yet the key storyline from mormont which is entirely unchanged is that whenever he sees someone else starting to have influence on dany he tries to cut it off at the headwith arya as cupbearer to tywin it is pretty unlikely that he would have a percieved commoner speaking freely to his council and even less likely that she could say something as pointed as the thinly veiled threat of anyone can die directed at himwhy not book tywin clearly cares only about whether someone is of use and lannister honor he would take advice from anyone who can provide it and even if the line anyone can die may be slightly slightly unbelieveable it is so awesome that it overrides any objectionslikewise it seems pretty unlikely that jaqen would offer her 3 deaths and tywin wouldnt be the first name on her mind after having made that threat in the books it is more plauseable because she has no contact at all with tywin and only sees him from a distance and then realizes she should have named him as he is leaving cheswick was her first death in the books and the tickler taking his place robs arya of the moment when she does it herself in storm of swords the whole is there gold in the village as she stabs him over and over i understand that not even having named him as the tickler until this episode and having his torture scenes so brief and nongraphic in nature he probably would not even be remembered by next season or two seasons from now but it still is a bit disappointing perhaps polliver will take his place in that sceneyou yourself suggested why this isnt an important change so ill just agree with youharrenhal is not nearly the hell it was for arya where she was constantly in danger and stuck on manual labor duties scrubbing floors and what not as the surprisingly friendly tywins cupbearer she argueably has it better than most of the commoners in the kingdom at this point no vargo hoat and the bloody mummers certainly plays a role there though i understand the casting costs for delaying their entrance to the story of course if they do cast them next season and if weasel soup still happens this season then vargo wont be changing sides in nearly the same mannertell you whatyou go watch a show involving lots of scrubbing of stairs and ill watch this one inconceivable that this could be considered an important change and as long as arya is involved in harrenhal changing hands then i dont see how any change prior to that could be even slightly relevantno reeds bran has the green dreams instead and osha apparently is going to be the one interpretting them howland reed was the only survivor of the tower of joy and it appears that story line may be cut completely no mention of ramsay snow yet but it is still early still this would have seemed to be the perfect time to bring him up story line wisejojen reed is nothing more than an annoying exposition device so ill be glad if hes cut if he is theres still no reason why howland reed cant show up at some point as long as someone tortures theon eventually does it have to be ramsay snowand theres no evidence as of yet that it wont be anyway"
"A Redeemed Hound",2012-04-30,"i have a feeling that the reeds will not be written in i am betting that maester luwin takes rickon and osha and hodor take bran north just a thought but i can see it playing out like that they are already making osha out to be more knowing than she was even in the books"
"Tadco26",2012-04-30,"ultimately it doesnt matter what loras believes because brienne escapes either way i think they are setting up the tyrells joining the lannisters rather than stannisbecause loras believes stannis did it minor change that helps the writers out a lot i cant imagine why loras killing kings guard members matters in the long run or when briennes first kill occurs both irrelevant changes and margerys negotiations fit well with this margery who is willing to do whatever she needs to do to be queen and is frankly more interesting that book margery and to the point the negotations occur so who cares when none of these are important changesin your opinion leaving out the killing of the rainbow guard members was not of major importance to me especially considering the lack of screen time to set up that scene however removing loras killing any guards takes away the rage that ser loras was under at the time and the actions that haunt him in the future not even suspecting brienne or catelyn right after it happens is just completely unbelieveable even if there was no books to compare it to the last two people with the king when he died both fled the scene and they arent even suspects if ser loras so easily dismisses the idea then why exactly did brienne need to flee the bannermen who swapped sides to stannis arent likely to care muchmargerys actions do fit well with her tv character and at the core i dont mind them but i do think it a bit of a stretch for them to be starting those negotiations with loras in the room grieving renly but this is the type of change that i can overlookthey cant keep every lord and peasant with a minor part this is no more an important change than subbing bron for bywater as commander of the gold cloaks and they already set the stage for davoss orders being ignored by knights and lords who wont follow a smuggler stannis tells davos as much so your concern may never even materialize and i dont see it as important even if it doesperhaps but apparently they did cast gordon mann as ser imry florent and he is set to appear in the blackwater bay episode i do think it is significant if davos orders lead to the disaster at blackwater when he is the one that points out the errors which would have mitigated their losses in the books its the difference between him being an incompetant admiral and seeing that lords are often given tasks they arent suited for due to their birth over lower born people who might be more capable and the disasterous results that can come of thatthat first part is a matter of opnion i think shes fine secondly although cleftjaw floats the idea of doing your own thing theon will doubtless be the one with the plan plus it fits better with the somewhat more sympathetic character showtheon is minor minorchangeseverything we are discussing is a matter of opinion theon being ambitious and convincing cleftjaw to go siege torrhens square with the specific purpose of hitting winterfell is a different mindset than cleftjaw convincing theon they should attack there and then coming up with the idea for winterfell after the fact sure it isnt a game changer but it is the type of change that they quite easily could have kept true with no additional screen time theon suggesting the idea might have even believeably won him some respect among his crewi would include this as the definition of irrelevent minor change in the picture dictionary of the got book to show dictionaryonly time will tell but it will be interesting to see how sam escapes the wights and white walkers if the only way in or out is thru their attack pathxaro isnt gay as an imporant plot change banggif classbbcemoticon altbang   hes still interested in dany for a reason other than romance so the essence is the same and the unsullied part hasnt happened yet the key storyline from mormont which is entirely unchanged is that whenever he sees someone else starting to have influence on dany he tries to cut it off at the headpart of the reason dany dismisses the notion even though she still considers marrying xaro is because she knows he has absolutely zero desire for her how do we know in the context of the tv show that he is only interested in dany for reasons other than romance one of the key reasons we know in the books is because xaro isnt interested in women book xaro is completely against helping dany with any war efforts because it is bad for trade where tv xaro seems pretty open to the idea mormont saying that she should rely completely on aid from westeros is in complete contradiction to the idea of getting an army of unsullied in fact the attitude that no foreign aid should be used is much more in line with ser barriston jorah could have just as easily cut off the relationship by bringing up the wedding custom that would cost her one of her dragons will this ruin the tv show no but it is a significant change from the book which will either result in more changes when the unsullied come up or a contradiction in attitude by ser jorahwhy not book tywin clearly cares only about whether someone is of use and lannister honor he would take advice from anyone who can provide it and even if the line anyone can die may be slightly slightly unbelieveable it is so awesome that it overrides any objectionsgreat for you if you find it believeable that the lord of casterly rock would let a peasant make a veiled threat towards him in front of his war coucil and stare him down but i found it completely unrealistic even though it was incredibly acted if a peasant threatening you at your war council meeting isnt a threat to his honor i dont know what qualifiestell you whatyou go watch a show involving lots of scrubbing of stairs and ill watch this one inconceivable that this could be considered an important change and as long as arya is involved in harrenhal changing hands then i dont see how any change prior to that could be even slightly relevantyou say it as if there would be hours of time spent watching her scrub stairs we are talking about seeing her do manual labor for a few seconds instead of sitting around talking to gendry as if they are guests of tywin the point of arya being stuck doing hard manual labor and being slapped when she asks to do the stables rather than the kitchen is to see the difference between how high borns are treated and commoners much of which has been glossed over or completely contradicted here by tywins actions is there a safer place that book arya visits in all of her travels after neds death than tv harrenhal before getting the 3 deaths from jaqen she felt like a mouse who was powerless and beaten down in the books on the tv show she is threatening tywin in front of his war counciljojen reed is nothing more than an annoying exposition device so ill be glad if hes cut if he is theres still no reason why howland reed cant show up at some point as long as someone tortures theon eventually does it have to be ramsay snowand theres no evidence as of yet that it wont be anywayno none of that has to happen for the story to go on in fact they didnt have to cast renly in the first place since he died already if you want to take it to the extreme that the end result is all that matters i do think it starts to become a much different story when you start making these changes though great that they dont bother you but that doesnt mean they arent there now none of these changes ruined this episode for me i gave it an 8 so how bad could they be but i do think that if the goal was to follow the books as closely as possible they made quite a few changes that could have been kept in their original form without any additonal screen time casting or special effects

"Arrogant Bastard",2012-04-30,"id give it a 85 but ill bump it up to 9 because of the strong performances probably my favorite episode thus far in the season and a big improvement over the total mess that was last episode really enjoyed the stannis davos interaction after renlys death and im glad the showrunners explained that renlys bannermen joined stannis which is something they didnt really elaborate on very well last episode that stannis needed renlys bannermen would have liked a scene with some of hte bannermne or at least names of them but good enough speaking of renly his death was a disappointment looked kinda corny on screen wasnt really scary and i wish they had brienne fight off the two attackers instead of kill them littlefinger scene with loras and margaery was alright though i really hope its the last we see of him for a while theyve really been overusing littlefinger aside from tyrion he probably has had the most screentime and has been in every episode this season varys is the one that should be featured more and sadly he hasnt appeared once in the last two episodes i really hope this is the last we see of littlefinger until near the end of hte season and i imagine it will be loved the arya tywin scene great acting by both williams and dance and lots of tension the guy playing jaqen is perfect too and while this is nitpicking i wish they also would have showed rorge adn biter arriving just to make it more clear what was going on tickler going early is regrettable but he was never going to be kept until season four i actually liked the dany qarth scenes even if they spent maybe too much time there glad theyre not getting rid of all the mystery and magical elements and i wasnt a big fan of dany scenes in acok that much anyway so the changes didnt bother me at all much better than that awful 80s style fantasy schock scene from last epsiode of dany arriving at the gates i was meh on the theon scenes dont really care for yarashe just seems really boring compared to asha still it set up theon taking winterfell well enough which i imagine happens next episode"

"gogorath",2012-04-30,"gave it an 8 there were some uneven moments and some parts i wasnt swept away by but the i love when the writers manage present common themes across the storylines within an episode without forcing it this episode had a really interesting thread on whether or not a leader needs to be loved whether it is an advantage or a hindrance  all part of the discussion of what makes a good ruler and how that intersects with being able to become a ruler this plus some great scenes  jorah and dany and arya and twyin in particular as well as brienne just destroying those two knights"

"ServantOnIce",2012-05-01,"i give it a 910 i love qaarth it is just like i imagined it also the dothraki in the tv show are savages and that is what happens when you bring savages into refined wealth and culture the dothraki are having a hard time with the life while doreah from lys isnt it is good for her to be back in civilization not riding in horse waste and stinky plains she is a pleasure house slave meant to be a high end escort wearing expensive perfumes and clothes in a free city or a kept mistress of a wealthy person not some horse lord lackey but the dothraki feel like dany is selling out that they are losing what is apart of themselves being there they take they fight that is what they do they are the land reavers while the iron born are the sea reavers i like the actress playing yaraasha the reality is a woman wouldnt look good on a stinky ship with a bunch of raping men she would be husky dirty funky and have a bad attitude that is what it takes to lead rapers and hoodlums without being a prey to them yourself the book was too much fantasy the show is more realistic the woman can act as well heck i would follow her into battle she looks like the average kick butt woman who serves in our military"

"GSP",2012-05-01,"solid 8 would have thrown an 85 if it was possible wow an entire episode without gratuitious sex scenes perfect i realize the show needs to make a lot of changes from the books and they often make sense but to me there were a series of little changes from the book that i just dont understand why they are making them jon begging to go with the halfhand when in the book the halfhand chooses to bring him the wildfire being joffrey and the queens idea whats his face in qarth having previously married for love but loosing her instead of clearly being gay just dont know what about translating the epic onscreen is helped by these changes which kind of screw with the characters imho"

"zippypoodle",2012-05-01,"meh im not as concerned about the minor changes axing the reeds is fine and whatever re jaqen hgars dialect shift but for episode 5 the pacing seems off and why wouldnt she have just chosen tywin by advancing the timeline and cutting out arrys side trek theyre making a hash of major plot pointsthis barely earned a 7 but its production values were still topnotch i have no clue what you people base your 9s on ill be reading the thread to find out but call me a skeptic of this season doing wellnope tywin was there in the book and she neglected to say tywin so that criticism is off the tableand apparently the show keeps hitting records for viewers every week so that concern is off the table"

"Tadco26",2012-05-02,"that is another reason why making her tywins cupbearer in the first place is a questionable idea it makes tywin a bigger protector for her than jaqen in a time when she is not supposed to feel safe its hard for me to accept that she wouldnt think of tywin when she just came from threatening him with the whole anyone can die line unless you believe she didnt intend that to be a threat aryas thoughts while she is at harrenhal revolve around all the monsters that tywin has in his service who might beat or kill you for looking at them wrong and how she has to become a mouse who stays out of sight and out of mind to avoid that fate since tywin rescued her we havent seen any of that or felt any sense of danger for arya or gendry i guess we shall see next episode how it plays out edited by tadco26 02 may 2012  0126 pm"

"Gerstinator",2012-05-03,"i gave it a ten just because it was the first great episode of this season imo i wasnt to sure about the first four episodes but this one really did it for me briennes character development is so key to making the next seasons work that i was happy to see that role progress strongly in this episode tyrion was great as usual and i found in this episode you really get a sense at how badly his sister and nephew will do at protecting the city from stanis if left to their own devices i really enjoy the scenes involving the iron islands and theon his path in life has finally brought him home but he now knows that all his past deeds and acomplishments are of no importance and he must prove himself as a true ironborn i look forward to see how these characters continue to develop through this season and hopefully the episodes continue at this pace"
"Currawong",2012-05-09,"i have carefully not reread books 1 and 2 before seeing the tv series so that i can try to judge the show on its own merits as tv and i have to say i do like the adaptation the changes make sense in terms of the story hanging together for a viewer and certainly this episode only just shown in australia was the best of series 2 so far intensely dramatic and the stories of the various characters are moving up in pace id rate it a 95 mainly because as with all the episodes so far i wish it could be just 510 minutes longer"
"Winter Wasnt That Bad",2012-05-11,"i like the brienne character in this show but the renly death is not so good almost boring to watch thought that would be done better needed more physically darker and creepy atmosphere also was this the episode that had the knights cage match or maybe it was in the previous episode i just have to say that scene was totally lame that is one of the best scenes in the book and also introduces a main character but the show only has brienne and loras fighting and pretty awkwardly at that"
"smallfolktypeperson",2012-05-14,"really really enjoying the arya scenesthis young actress can really hold her own with the older actors the aryatywin scenes and aryajaqen scenes were my favorites this episode brienne is impressing me too i was really worried about her casting but seems to be working out fine so far"

"Janos Pyke",2012-06-20,"i gave it a 6 i can deal with the whole books and tv are different mediums fact but there are things that could have been better for example the little detail about how the ironborn ships longships are depicted in the series if we take the inspiration for the ironborn culture are the vikings then we are talking about a ship very much like this and what they gave us in the series was something in the neighborhood of cristopher columbus caravelsso instead of a vikinglike culture what we have is pirates from the caribbean in leather doubletsand yes i agree with those who didnt like dagmer portrayal edited by janos pyke 20 june 2012  0301 pm"

"Pliny",2012-04-30,"i have read many a comment protesting tv aryas choice of the tickler as her first jaqen kill many have cited that this will make it impossible for her to kill the tickler in the inn later saying this is a major point of character development for her i remember this scene where arya kills him in a fit of rage and i remember cheering for her and feeling sad for her at the same time but i need some help as to how it advances her character development ive only read it once and it was a few months back the way i remember it was that it seemed a very human thing and in a way a very childlike thing for her to do giving in to her emotions and all whereas later she seems to detach and control her emotions and separate from her identity as arya or arry or weasel or any of the names shes used i am not being critical of anybody saying this is an important moment for her rather that i must have missed its deeper importance and would like to read some other takes on it i know many on these boards have read multiple times and given these novels much thought and i would be happy to learn something i didnt realize thanks in advance"
"sarah.jenice",2012-05-01,"hmmmi actually understood the choice they made with having her chose the tickler because he was at the forefront of her mind as someone who needed to be killed she was probably testing jaquen to see if he was serious and the tv audience may not remember the tickler after the brief time that we had with him and the time it will take for arya and the hound to get to the inn and kill him in 12 seasons from now on the books i feel like the inn scene with the hound and arya was a display of how dark a road she was going to be traveling down she kills in self defense and she kills to escape places earlier but i thought her tickler kill was pretty brutal dont get me wrong  i was really proud of her for taking him out and totally think he deserved it  but i do think the more she killed the easier it became for her to eventually become a fm also isnt this her first personal kill from her prayer list that is a big step for her to take one of the lives that she has been praying to end i hope that helps"
"Iotun",2012-05-01,"im not sure how i can say that it advances her character because i find it very difficult to quantify such things i cant say that event x has meant that character y has amassed z amounts of said attribute thus their character is now thisthat arya is still arya before and after that scene it is a very strong scene however and i think its a very strong visual id say it shows how regardless of all her strength arya is a very damaged and brutalized child by now whos had to witness some really horrible things how deeply emotional her pain is but also how brutally she expresses that pain given the chance its very much a loss of innocence moment despite all that i still think its a scene that wouldnt have worked as well in the series simply because most of the audience by the time that scene came up likely season 4 would have no way of remembering a minor character like the tickler who appeared years ago for a few brief moments in a single episode and given that the plot requires arya to now spend her wishes on minor characters it makes sense for those minor characters to be people that weve at least been introduced to i still hope that they manage to do some similar scene in the future when the time comes how about her killing ser meryn it would make sense as a character who would recognize the hound and who arya would hate for his involvement in her fathers death and killing syrio by i think hes bound to be killed on the blackwater so i dont know"

"Blangadanger",2012-05-02,"i was a little shocked that she would name the tickler but given that they hardly focused on the tickler i seriously doubt it would have been a powerful moment on screen had she started screaming out his questions from the book while killing him two seasons from now they still have a chance to do a similar scene however as long as they dont change much more if they had jaqen kill polliver so she could get needle back in harrenhal for instance it would be a striking difference to her character and one that many book readers would vehemently hate i would guess lets hope the producers are smart enough to not do that at least"

"boojam",2012-05-03,"i have read many a comment protesting tv aryas choice of the tickler as her first jaqen kill many have cited that this will make it impossible for her to kill the tickler in the inn later saying this is a major point of character development for heri remember this scene where arya kills him in a fit of rage and i remember cheering for her and feeling sad for her at the same time but i need some help as to how it advances her character development ive only read it once and it was a few months back the way i remember it was that it seemed a very human thing and in a way a very childlike thing for her to do giving in to her emotions and all whereas later she seems to detach and control her emotions and separate from her identity as arya or arry or weasel or any of the names shes used i am not being critical of anybody saying this is an important moment for her rather that i must have missed its deeper importance and would like to read some other takes on it i know many on these boards have read multiple times and given these novels much thought and i would be happy to learn something i didnt realizethanks in advancei think its of more importance that a strange bond has grown between the hound and arya he grudgingly comes to admire her true grit shes has a growing ambivalence about sandorin the tavern fight she essentially saves sandors life a very odd twist that between the two of them they kill three men polliver  tickler and the squire we never find his name i think actually arya kills the squire all on her own exactly why polliver and the tickler are there i cant remember  there are enough ball pen brutes running about tickler would be easy to replaced polliver is important since he has needle its gonna be disappointing if arya gets needle back before retrieves from the dead polliver arya then helps sandor to his horse  sandor develops an odd relationship with the stark girlslater as sandor lays dying arya actually kind of nurses him i would like to know why george uses boiling wine a lot boiling wine drives off the alcohol better to just pour on as it is or heck use boiling water save the winegeorge leaves it ambiguous as to why arya does not use needle to kill the hound he asks her to give him mercy its as if she conflicted about being cruel she leaves him note he disappears from her hit list after thatvague rumblings that sandor has survived we shall seeso that whole sequence is important in aryas futher development plus it makes a hell of a scenario"

"TheArrynsKnight",2012-05-03,"her murdering the tickler has nothing to do with character development why would anyone say that she had killed many people by then it was just a fantastic and powerful scene in the books and it was very satisfying knowing the tickler got that type of justice with arya repeating his own repetitive words while killing himof course the show ruined it thoughi disagree with this i think its on of her biggest character developments in the book basically because she saves the hound she saves this savage that has been on her list for so long where she could just ran away and let them have him but she instead chooses to take on the tickler because he has scarred her in some ways so i think it is a important actually very important scene for aryas character developmentand i too am getting more and more annoyed by all the changes they are making in the second season doesnt feel like any of the changes make it better either in any way altough the scenes with the rats were brutal and fitting so they showed the brutality in a rather good way edited by ollieowl 03 may 2012  0306 pm"

"Just so.",2013-04-13,"loras not even suspecting brienne of killing renly when he is convinced she did it in the books and they even did his casting based on the confrontation from feast loras also killed two of his sworn rainbow guard brothers in rage who were guarding outside the tent where here is talked down from hurting an unarmed littlefinger who is starting wedding negotiations with margeary over renlys corpsebriennes first slaying of a man wasnt until feast where she slayed several of the guards heredavos is made admiral of stanniss fleet where imry florent the queens brother who has no experience as an admiral leads the attack on blackwater bay while davos will no doubt be made to make the same mistakes in the show in the book davos is the one pointing out the mistakes ser imry is making in being over confident and not sending out any scouts or noticing the tower which holds the chain also ser imry keeps saladors ships back because he does not trust them when davos feels this was a waste as these were some of the most experienced war time sailorsasha hasnt fit her book character so far the cleftjaw is the one suggesting they alter their raiding target where in the books theon is the one convincing himthe cliff side approaches of the tv fist of the first men will make escaping from it when it is attacked problematic as there appeared to be only one way in and outqarth is almost completely original content xaro is not gay and they didnt bring up how if they were married the bride and groom could ask for one gift of one another which could not be refused with xaros being one of her dragons one has to wonder if dany might not have considered xaro more seriously for marriage if she thought he had any interest in her what so ever especially when he makes it seem much more so than the books that he would support her war effort they also made jorah mormont seem like he was against bringing any foreign aid to conquer westeros when it was his idea to get the unsulliedwith arya as cupbearer to tywin it is pretty unlikely that he would have a percieved commoner speaking freely to his council and even less likely that she could say something as pointed as the thinly veiled threat of anyone can die directed at himlikewise it seems pretty unlikely that jaqen would offer her 3 deaths and tywin wouldnt be the first name on her mind after having made that threat in the books it is more plauseable because she has no contact at all with tywin and only sees him from a distance and then realizes she should have named him as he is leaving cheswick was her first death in the books and the tickler taking his place robs arya of the moment when she does it herself in storm of swords the whole is there gold in the village as she stabs him over and over i understand that not even having named him as the tickler until this episode and having his torture scenes so brief and nongraphic in nature he probably would not even be remembered by next season or two seasons from now but it still is a bit disappointing perhaps polliver will take his place in that sceneharrenhal is not nearly the hell it was for arya where she was constantly in danger and stuck on manual labor duties scrubbing floors and what not as the surprisingly friendly tywins cupbearer she argueably has it better than most of the commoners in the kingdom at this point no vargo hoat and the bloody mummers certainly plays a role there though i understand the casting costs for delaying their entrance to the story of course if they do cast them next season and if weasel soup still happens this season then vargo wont be changing sides in nearly the same mannerno reeds bran has the green dreams instead and osha apparently is going to be the one interpretting them howland reed was the only survivor of the tower of joy and it appears that story line may be cut completely no mention of ramsay snow yet but it is still early still this would have seemed to be the perfect time to bring him up story line wiseno edric storm an understandable cut but still this is one of the major tension points between davos and stannis in storm and the first time we learn of melisandres desire to sacrifice someone who has kings blood everything you say is trueits been a long while since ive read the books and i have just finished watching the season 2 and i was lost for any accuracy towards the booksjon snow and quaron halfhand arya girl thought she was only know as girl by gendry was renly the biggest poof as is made out in the show seems very loosely based on the books season 2"
"turdle",2012-04-30,"ok specifically i want to discuss the way the tv show decided to lay the shadow out for the audience vs the way the book does i completely understand the decision to show the shadow being born as a cliff hanger end to the previous episode i enjoyed it and a lot of nonbook readers seemed to enjoy it as well however the problem with doing that is that the audience goes and imagines all kinds of crazy things that they think the shadow might do only to find out that the shadow sneaks in and kills renly and then disappears at the end of last weeks episode all my friends were discussing their theories on what the shadow was going to do and were generally very excited about it and not that killing renly wasnt significant but i could clearly tell that it wasnt as impressive as the things they were thinking might happen i know that when i got to that part in the book it was jarring and it comes out of nowhere and it would have been a pretty big gamble to show renlys death scene with no set up but i think the show would be better for it in the long run if they had done it the way the book did renly killed by shadow first see the birth of a shadow second not to mention that there will presumably be no more shadows this season so theyve shot their wad in two consecutive scenes"
"Pliny",2012-05-01,"i know that when i got to that part in the book it was jarring and it comes out of nowhere and it would have been a pretty big gamble to show renlys death scene with no set up but i think the show would be better for it in the long run if they had done it the way the book did renly killed by shadow first see the birth of a shadow secondnot to mention that there will presumably be no more shadows this season so theyve shot their wad in two consecutive scenesi also liked the progression better in the book as youve said it was scary and unexpected as well as unexplained for a time i also thought that the renlykilling shadow was sent without stannis knowledge in the show stannis sends her in doesnt that mean that he never meant to honor what he said about giving renly until morning that doesnt sound very bookstannislikei dont think the show is going to deal at all with edric storm so i guess there wouldnt have been any other time to show a shadow birth"
"turdle",2012-05-01,"i hope that they send off mel to storms end to at least imply that another shadow creature exists because having only one shadow show up with no real follow up is going to be weird to viewers i know my friends are under the impression that the shadow is going to be a bigger part of the season and i dont want to spoil anything so im keeping quiet"
"OzorxOron",2012-05-01,"it was a lot better in the book i loved how a gust of wind brought the death of a king in the blink of an eye in the show you could clearly see what was about to happen and there was no shock when it did"
"Stark@heart",2012-05-01,"theyre already at storms end they didnt include the leeches or edric so we wont see the castellan die either the next magic we see from mel is at the battle beyond the wall which will probably be next season so im guessing well see her staring into the flames alot and making prophecies but no more magic this season"
"RobertOfTheHouseBaratheon",2012-05-02,"i dont understand the barred gate scene renly was camped in a tent why did they construct bars in a cave on a cliff if it was to an underground entrance to storms end that would make sense but they cant have been at storms end as renly would be staying in his castle if it was why be in a cave by the sea anyway and what were the bars blocking an entrance to mel said something like theyve blocked it now has she been there before if renly was camped on his way to kl his army would be strewn accross fields its unlikely that mel or even stannis knows of specific caves in the cliff of a random fieldis it me or have they seriously dropped the ball in places this season was this part of something that was much bigger until the cutting room floor and now sticks out like a sore thumb they should have reshot that scene to fit in i originally thought it was a cliff hanger and the location explanation would be explained this episode but no its just random"

"victim",2012-05-02,"perhaps the shadow cant swim just a thought not a serious one but one none the less or maybe stannis just wanted them to be well away from his own men and ships hence the smuggling the cave was a pretty cool location as well a bit weird but cool my nonreader friends thought the shadowstannis was just going to mess shit up in renlys camp and were pretty shocked when it assassinated renly himself though the entire scene felt out of place at the very beginning of an episode and made last weeks cliffhanger wrap itself up really quick it also wasnt as frightening as it was in the books because cat thinking initially that it was just renlys shadow before realising seconds too late was lost on the screen in my opinion it would have been a fine scene if we didnt see the shadow coming through the tent flaps rather only hearing the gust of wind instead seeing briennes reaction and then seeing it behind renly in the mirror renly was also stabbed from behind i wonder if that was done on purpose"
"bikie",2012-05-02,"i watched the show yesterday with the interactive features on and they had a small bit on the shadow scene and it appeared from the filming that they were trying to film the scene with an actual shadow doing the killing and not the cgi monster they showed an extras shadow being filmed with a sword rearing back against the tent guess it just didnt work in production and they decided to go the cgi route but i agree that unlike say neds death which i thought hbo did amazingly well renlys just lacked the expected shock horror and importance it had in the book"
"Buckwheat",2012-05-02,"i dont understand the barred gate scene renly was camped in a tent why did they construct bars in a cave on a cliff if it was to an underground entrance to storms end that would make sense but they cant have been at storms end as renly would be staying in his castle if it was why be in a cave by the sea anyway and what were the bars blocking an entrance to mel said something like theyve blocked it now has she been there before if renly was camped on his way to kl his army would be strewn accross fields its unlikely that mel or even stannis knows of specific caves in the cliff of a random fieldis it me or have they seriously dropped the ball in places this season was this part of something that was much bigger until the cutting room floor and now sticks out like a sore thumb they should have reshot that scene to fit in i originally thought it was a cliff hanger and the location explanation would be explained this episode but no its just randomi agree with everything you said the scene in the cave makes me think they were shooting the storms end chapter only later they used the scene for renlys murderthe shadow is not like i imagined it i always thought it was more like an actual shadow that is twodimensional seen only as projected on the canvas of the tent but i liked it the way it looked on the show too i just did not have many expectations from that scene"
"turdle",2012-05-02,"but i agree that unlike say neds death which i thought hbo did amazingly well renlys just lacked the expected shock horror and importance it had in the bookwell there was no way they were going to be able to make it  to neds death i think the main hindrance is the order in which they showed the shadow"
"FantA´me",2012-05-02,"ive seen posts and heard from a lot of non readers who dislike the shadow babys appearance with comments like  if hestannis can cast a super invincible smoke killer why doesnt he just send it to kill joffrey or the whole enemy army its stupid  its too easy  it doesnt make any sense   i wasnt on any forum when reading acok so i dont know about everybody else but that certainly wasnt my reaction following renlys death"

"Targh",2012-05-04,"so i heard this described as a cervixtoheir missile i just had to share that"
"Bambi",2012-05-04,"i am totally disappointed with the shadow scene in the movie its not a shadow its more like black smoke an actual shadow would have been a lot creepier mystical and i presume it wouldve cost a lot less they couldve turned that cgi money on other more important things"
"I'll pay the iron price",2012-05-05,"i thought the shadow scenes were well done poor renly never knew what hit him"
"Darth Pipes",2012-05-06,"they should have stuck with the shadow far cooler and creepier not to mention cheaper for them to do use that money elsewhere"

"Volantis",2013-01-05,"after escaping from renlys camp its just her and brienne and last episode there seemed to be no one else from the north with her the man who was standing next to her during the melee was one of renlys"
"Envie",2012-04-30,"best scene ever the look between tywin lannister and arya stark sent chills racing up my spine i feel they have found a very special chemistry in their acting and i have so looked forward to that moment ever since we learned theyd changed the story to make arya tywins cup bearer instead of boltons while the roose bolton  arya exchange was essentially the same it seemed way waaaay more scary with tywin saying those lines so much electric charged tension so much unsaid threat and promise revenge blood seething hatred all from a little girl and an old man freaking amazing"
"Thunderfist",2012-04-30,"i agree these two actors are great and when you combine them there is awesomeness"
"salt",2012-04-30,"while i love these two actors i thought the scene was terrible and blatantly insulting to the spirit of martins work changing things from the books is fine altering characters and plots can be necessary for the sake of the show but a ridiculous scene like this goes against the basic core nature of these storieseveryone in the room would have felt that tension a peasant girl just lied to the lord of casterly rock revealed she was actually from the north and then stared him down there was as you saidso much electric charged tension so much unsaid threat and promise revenge blood seething hatredwhich was obvious to all of us watching and certainly would have been apparent to lord tywin and his reaction to that is to put her in charge of what he drinks absurd this felt like something that belonges in a summer blockbuster not a brutally honest story that gives us neds death and the red weddingi often find myself drawing comparisons between game of thrones and the wire because the wire is one of the few shows ive ever seen on television that approaches the level of complexity and intelligence found in the asoiaf novels in one episode of the wire a leading drug dealer played by the famous and charismatic rapper method man and his people are meeting with another criminal to make a business deal method mans character starts giving a dramatic speech about how all the other players in the drug game in town have fallen except for him hes got a pistol in his hand with all eyes are focused on him the biggest man in the room saying that now it is his time and is halfway through a sentence when one of his subordinates pulls out a gun and blows a hole through his skullasoiaf has always been honest it isnt the place where children get to make cool speeches and the whole room sits back and says damn that was dramatic that little kid sure is a badass anyone can be killed and when youre a peasant lying to staring down and threatening lord tywin lannister shield of lannisport and warden of the west youre killed pretty quickly edited by salt 30 april 2012  0411 am"
"Arkash",2012-04-30,"i agree it wasnt realistic at all and in the books arya would have been killed on the moment for saying such things but damn it worked so well on screen"
"SerArthurHeath",2012-04-30,"previously i had assumed tywin liked aryas attitude because she reminds him of a young cersei whom tywin was specifically fond of and friendly to in her flashbacks at least but yeah this is probably pushing it"
"Raylan Stark",2012-04-30,"otoh tywin seems i guess intrigued is the best word with arya he has been from the moment he met her i know it seems out of character for tywin to let insolence slide but perhaps this is why he did as quickly as he susses out her lies youd think hed put 2 and 2 together theres a line from i believe asos it says how tywin never smiled but very rarely hed threaten to smile and when he did it was terrible to behold paraphrasing charles dance nailed that"
"Storm of Words",2012-04-30,"i agree it wasnt realistic at all and in the books arya would have been killed on the moment for saying such things but damn it worked so well on screenhi guys some commonernoob talk from me the acting was great charles dance and maisie are awesomebut i also think that the writing gets worse the more they go away from martins originalthe whole ensemble of the actors is great you can argue about 13 but the writers seem helpless sometimes realising that martins huge books have to fit in so little screentimei can understand that the producers and writers want to put dance in more scenes looking at how great he acts but the harrenhall situation gets really out of linei liked the scenes in the books when arya interacted with roose bolton and how dark harrenhall was the reader was beginning to learn that bolton was a real dangerous man although he was one of robbs alliesif my english sucks please be patient "
"strifed169",2012-04-30,"didnt like the scene at all arya is known to be bold but she overdid it staring down an elite figure like tywin lannister not only that tywin allowed it huge out of character moment kind of lost the immersion of arya and tywins storyline a bit for me at least"
"Balefont",2012-04-30,"heres a thought tywin knew she was from the north and therefore did not have cause to love him for his part of the war and the turmoil of her homelands plus hed lose face if he changed his mind as having her a his cupbearer after trying to make a point to his men that the smallfolk can be of use  even untrained little girls plus he asked her for her thoughts dont ask a question if youre not ready to hear the answerseems like he was giving her some benefit of the doubt for being uncouth"
"Battlekitten",2012-04-30,"i thought it was a dangerous thing to say they were talking about what to do with robb and his military invincibility anyone can be killed in this context lays the foundations for rw and mirrors what stannis did with renly ie just take out the leader my issue is her pronunciation of my lord not mlord  it was referred to as a big deal in the books marking someone as not of small folk and there goes arya and what is a girl from barrowtown doing in the riverlands perhaps tywin would not be interested at the war council but if i were him i would like to know"
"The Monkey",2012-04-30,"loved the scene dont think it was out of character for tywin to let it pass he has very small regard for lowborns and if his cupbearer hates him what of it he would still expect discipline and its wouldnt occur to him that she would try to kill him he assumes that peasants by default are too scared or cowardly to even consider to do harm to such a high lord as himself"
"Fez",2012-04-30,"loved the scene i might be imagining it but im pretty sure at the end of scene as arya is walking off to get the water tywin looks down at the food she had put out in front of him and pushes it away almost as if he thought maybe she was going to try to poison him or at the least that her ability to stand up to him put him completely off eating"
"Pellaeon",2012-04-30,"tywin is no monster like ser gregor from his pov arya is just a little girl that lie to him because she is scared and after he revield the lie he get exactly what he want he try to show his council wich kind of attitude the northmen have and how they woreship the starks what expect you of him to kill a little girl because she lie or say something stupid in the book when tywin and tyrion speak about rhaegars children you see that he did it because for him it was the only way but he didnt like it he wouldnt care about a girl speak against him"
"Greywolf2375",2012-04-30,"i agree it wasnt realistic at all and in the books arya would have been killed on the moment for saying such things but damn it worked so well on screeni dont think she would have been killed but i dont see a man like tywin keeping someone around that he knows had lied to her once is from the north and then just made that commenti liked the scene  they did it very well but it just doesnt follow based on tywins caution there is no reason now that tywins name doesnt get in her list"
"SerArthurHeath",2012-04-30,"now arya has an excuse to not name tywin if he dies after she has made that threat she will be killed as she is number one suspect"
"SerArthurHeath",2012-04-30,"actually im not sure tywin realised she could be referring to him an extension of the lannister arrogance seen in show tyrion where he doesnt think that the demon monkey is him tywin lannister in his eyes cannot be killed so it makes sense that he ignores the meaning behind his serving girls words"
"The Black Wolf",2012-04-30,"i loved it simply loved it and i dont think its out of character for tywin to let it slide it would have been if arya had just spoken without being asked it might have been if tywin knew that she was arya and not some random lowborn girl i think he asks her to make a point to his men to show them how fiercely loyal even the lowest of the northmen are to robb tywin expects her answer to be like the one she gives what he might not have completely expected is the anyone can be killed which probably doesnt sound quite as much as an open threat to the lannisters as it does to us seeing as they dont know about arya like we do tywin isnt like cersei in the way that he doesnt feel the need to personally crush anyone that slightly defies him he chooses his battles and makes sure that when he strikes its going to mean something"

"Brynden Bloodraven",2012-04-30,"i really liked this invented scene as well sometime the show is spot on with what it adds it would be redundant for the show to have both tywin and roose occupy harrenhal although i was really looking forward to some of the scenes with the leech lordi thought the casting was right on the money for him other times im dumbfounded by the exchanges they choose to insert i could not be more upset by littlefinger professing his love to cat it is entirely out of character for lf to show his hand unless its in an indirect way i love the scene in the books where lf is building the castles with sansaalayne also the valaryian stone wtf is that bankcome on give me the real xaro"

"Tadco26",2012-04-30,"i think the scene was very well acted and completely unbelieveable in the way it was written we get example after example in the books on how commoners are treated by knights and lords and this exchange was the polar opposite of those examples a veiled threat in front of his war council by anyone much less a northern commoner prisoner would not just go ignored if for no other reason than it would make him look weak in front of his bannermen"
"JayDubya",2012-04-30,"i put myself in tywins shoes in that scene and think 1 wow shes trying to sound ominous and threatening 2 but im the most powerful man in westeros  do i let myself feel threatened by a little girl 3 no of course i dont go get me the water little girl so she had a cover story hes probably patting himself on the back for sniffing it out and the fact that she didnt beg didnt plead for forgiveness indicates that she knows she did nothing wrong and i agree it is perfectly rational for a peasant northern girl to keep her identity a secret when shes a prisoner of the lannister army no 11yo peasant girl is steadfast in the face of a noble lord except for one with nothing to hide having said that i would if i were tywin move her to the kitchens at the beginning of the next episode"
"Balefont",2012-04-30,"charles dance said in an interview that there is a scene coming between arya and tywin where arya gets a small view of whats inside tywin it could be this scene but i doubt iti think the scene to which he referred may already have happened the scene when tywin enters harrenhall and saves gendry and the rest of the smallfolk from the tickler"

"Blangadanger",2012-04-30,"i think people may still be confusing tvtywin for booktywin they have very little in common personalitywise in the books tywin is downright evil hates everyone and is thoroughly engrossed on his familys lineage in contrast the tywin on the show is speculative whipsmart and rational just as tvtywin seems slightly impressed with tyrions analysis of the war after jaimes capture hes amused with this common girl telling him what she thinks of all men and the ease that they can be killed his own men are clueless about how to win a battle from this supposed legend of robb and only offer excuses and yet heres a young girl from the north who not only has the guile to survive the harsh realities of war but shows utmost loyalty to a king of the north whom she likely has never met however she follows up with anyone can be killed which gives him a hint of smile because he knows that robb is not an invincible wolfman yet another thing this girl knows more than his own men we the viewers obviously translate it as her wish upon his death which maisie delivered tremendously well i think it was an amazing scene maisie and charles are my versions of arya and tywin now edited by blangadanger 30 april 2012  1226 pm"
"TrackerNeil",2012-04-30,"i think it was an amazing scene maisie and charles are my versions of arya and tywin nowi know you could see in aryas eyes every inch of the various traumatic experiences shes suffered and i think tywin can see it too those of us whove read the books know that tywin lannister respects strength  so long as it doesnt in any way threaten his privileges or agenda  so i can see him approving in a condescnding of aryas response but i agree with what was said upthread you dont want someone with that look in her eye to pour your wine water or anything else you intend to ingest"
"Pliny",2012-04-30,"to me aryas anyone can be killed statement was more one of resignation to a harsh reality in a way i reminded me of her entry to the house of black and white arya the little girl gone and only arryweaselnanno one is left with seemingly no attachments no delusions of childlike faith and optimism and i dont think it necessarily seemed like a threat to tywin as others have said he expected her to be fierce as he pegged her for a northerner he finds her mildly amusing thats why he chose her for his cupbearer she held the stare a bit long perhaps this sad girl is a bit more interesting or maybe just for the moment i doubt hes too concerned hes probably more concerned as to why it took her so long to return with that water"
"Independent George",2012-04-30,"i think people may still be confusing tvtywin for booktywin they have very little in common personalitywise in the books tywin is downright evil hates everyone and is thoroughly engrossed on his familys lineage in contrast the tywin on the show is speculative whipsmart and rationalthats never been my view of booktywin ive always thought of him as whipsmart and rational tvtywin is an even more charismatic version of the one in my head  and id always pictured him as charismatic charles dance is just that good"
"Ixodes",2012-04-30,"i think people may still be confusing tvtywin for booktywin they have very little in common personalitywise in the books tywin is downright evil hates everyone and is thoroughly engrossed on his familys lineage in contrast the tywin on the show is speculative whipsmart and rationalthats what i thought at first but after some thought i am not so sure i think i interpreted tywin far more harshly in the book than i am in the show yet essentially the character isnt that different i actually am looking forward to another reread and see how the character strikes me now regardless tywin is portrayed so well in the show he is one of my favorite characters this has really surprised me"
"Independent George",2012-04-30,"i would also add that i think its extremely unlikely that tywin even knows that arya escaped the lannisters its obviously a closelyguarded secret as their leverage depends on having two stark children in captivity rmail has already been established as easy to intercept  i dont think tyrion would risk sending such sensitive information that way and theres no indication that they have riders moving back  forth between harrenhall and kings landing i think this goes back to my theory that s3 will include a scene where tywin is informed that arya escaped kings landing and that they have men searching for her and since theyre searching for someone while trying not to reveal who theyre searching for hell probably hear a pretty good description of her personality as well as her physical likeness at that point he ought to be able to put it all together and dispatch someone to recall his cupbearer who of course has by now fled thereby providing additional evidence of her identity depending on how weasel soup is handled this season tywin may end up staring at a boat load of evidence that he let arya stark slip right past his fingers and that would be beyond awesome to watch"
"cuendillar",2012-04-30,"its quite likely he didnt see it as a threat at all he asked several questions in one of robbs supposed immortality and if she believed that he had a direwolf tywin lannister isnt anyone in his own mind nor in the eyes of most people he did not hear it as a threat even though the we did holding the stare pretty much implied she knew there where more to the rumours about grey wind than just hearsay he might want to look further into why when theyre alone  and imply that her continued safety hings on his wellbeing he let her show defiance to gain her loyalty  the council will see her as a prime suspect should anything befall tywin he demands only loyalty in his men not love her life being tied to his ensures that nicely"
"kephv",2012-04-30,"probably my favorite scene this season maisie williams needs to win an emmy now and charles dance was amazing as well as for tywins reaction or lack of one i didnt think it was at all unrealistic he was clearly bored by talking to his bannerman and was amused by her responses i think as for the specific line well she told him straight up what he wanted to hear robb stark isnt invincible there was more under it of course but i dont think he cares that some norther peasant has no love for him he just doesnt care edited by manyfacedone 30 april 2012  0240 pm"
"Tall Tyrion Lannister!",2012-04-30,"tywin probably wouldnt take the threat too seriously if he didnt take his son holding a crossbow at him and telling him not to call tysha a whore or hed kill him seriously how is going to take arya seriously"
"Brave Ser Robin",2012-04-30,"i believe the main intent of the scene is not the interaction between tywin and arya the intent is to setup what is becoming the main story arc for arya that is the path leading to the house of black and white and beyond combine that scene with her interaction with the faceless man jaqen hghar with the murder of the tickler with aryas telling gendry that if he is practicing for combat he needs to do it right the director crafted the scene perfectly from that perspective arya delivers the statement anyone can be killed not as a threat but with a cold expression that reveals her desensitazation to killing foreshadowing what is to come chilling edited by brave ser robin 30 april 2012  0258 pm"

"bikie",2012-04-30,"my favorite scene of the hbo series and i dont think from tywins pov we can assume it was that big of an affront and threat we know who arya is and how wild and bold she is but taken in the context of a harmless girl who is a cupbearer she was just answering his questions and answered that robb is not what the stories about him from the north claim and i think hes also very intrigued by arya and sees potential edited by bikie 30 april 2012  0313 pm"
"7V3N",2012-04-30,"and remember it came from a girl who seemed too afraid to tell him she was a northerner i dont think tywin ever believed he lost control of the situation and he never felt threatened"
"Independent George",2012-04-30,"also  tywin was first introduced to her as a girl who wisely disguised herself as a boy to avoid being raped on the road he was actually impressed by the deception if shes also a northern girl it makes perfect sense that shed try to hide it while travelling through a war zone its also perfectly consistent for tywin to be impressed by the the lie especially since she managed to get his first question right its exactly the same as her lying about her gender as long as she eventually comes clean when he catches her and answers truthfully when confronted by it he has no reason to believe theres anything more to it than that edited by independent george 30 april 2012  0354 pm"
"Tadco26",2012-04-30,"i dont think that anyone believes tywin should have been scared of aryas veiled threat but realistically he wouldnt tolerate the insolence and disrespect especially in front of his council just as in season 1 when he goes to war over tyrion because the house cannot be made to look weak being threatened by your cup bearer in front of your bannermen would deserve punishment even if he didnt personally feel threatened at all it was a very well acted scene but it was also a pretty unrealistic one even before the threat some how i find it hard to imagine book tywin caring what a peasant girl thinks about anything much less interviewing her in front of the his bannermen plus it completely contradicts aryas state of mind prejaqen where she is a beaten scared mouse"
"7V3N",2012-04-30,"plus it completely contradicts aryas state of mind prejaqen where she is a beaten scared mouseyeah but with time being an issue for the series they needed to progress things pretty quickly i think they hit the scared thing pretty well before she was the cupbearer her talks with yoren and the tickler scenes conveyed her fear and desperation pretty well i think"

"Nebmai",2012-04-30,"i loved the scene until now i wasnt crazy about the tywin  roose change but this scene has made me glad they did it the scene very much captures much of the essence of the books and the series anyone can be killed is a perfect description of what sets got and asoiaf apart from a majority of their respective contemporariesits also major foreshadowing for both characters and its definitely showing the evolution of aryas character from the free spirited tom boy to what she will become as the story goes onalso you guys are way off saying the scene is unrealistic because tywin would not let her threaten him for fear of looking weak in front of his council he would look weak for taking a threat which isnt really a threat look back earlier in the series  books for tyrions clarification from a nine  ten year old girl prisoner seriously not the other way around she spoke when spoken to he asked her questions and she answered hes tywin fcking lannister not the mad king yo"
"Monk Meth-",2012-04-30,"lol tywin is cruel but he wouldnt kill arya for speaking the truth he wanted her to say"
"Howdyphillip",2012-04-30,"tywin reacting to an 11 year old girl based solely on that comment would be out of character for him it would have essentially been telling his bannermen that this little girl scared him out of all of the non canon scenes in this show this one nailed the book personalities of both characters involved tywin is a lion and being a lion does not show fear of a weasel"
"Envie",2012-04-30,"i really appreciate all the responses to this discussion and hearing different perspectives on how the scene fit or didnt fit their interpretation of tywin personally i felt tywin was weighing aryas worth with his pointed question he knew she was from the north which is why he challenged her with where she was from to get her to slip up so he could get inside her head it was also a good display for his bannermen to hear what a northern girls impression of robb stark might be like what the common folk are saying and how supportive they are is very important information to know when youre waging a battle if the common people are willing to rise up and support him then he has a strong claim the same as robert baratheons own rebellion did common people do not want a king or queen they cant love thats a common theme we see a lot in the story my husband wondered if maybe tywin had a suspicion who arya really was but i shot that down too  theres no way he could know that because cersei has not confessed to anyone other than tyrion that she no longer has arya in captivity tyrion even made a big scene about that a couple episodes back if you remember when he said it must be hard to be the disappointing child as a dig at cersei for her failures tywins change in the series has been a good one ill agree with others that some plot changes didnt really work or make sense but this one does and it really really works for the chemistry between tywin and a very defiant little arya was arya threatening tywin no i dont think so i think shes pointing out that she no longer believes in fairy tales and heroes as many are trying to make robb stark out to be with his magical dire wolf and all his victorious battles hes still just a human who can die at any time like anyone else who has died already thus far including her father i really believe her fathers death is what started arya down a path of hardened heart in regards to death a theme which stays with her and makes her successful when she crosses the narrow sea and joins the faceless men"

"teemo",2012-04-30,"im still not sure what i think of this scene i do know i love both of the actors though so its fun to watch no matter what i have two conflicting thoughts on this i would suspect tywin like most high lords really doesnt even acknowledge the existence of lowborn people unless they have the gall to say something like arya to roose when she wasnt spoken to from my perspective i have always seen tywin as very aloof and not giving a damn about most people around him especially lowborn i cant imagine him going up to prisoners and questioning them about their professions as soon as he arrives at harrenhal i also cant imagine book tywin caring at all what a cupbearer thinks and to the people that have said tywin is ruthless but not cruel i think he is quite cruel look at the things hes done to tyrion having your guardsmen fuck the girl your sons in love with thats disgusting i dont think i ever recall him being amiable to anyone not even his own children hell cersei and jaime are just pretty pawns for him i also think that there might have been some repercussions for arya speaking to him like that it wasnt downright threatening but she did lie to him i notice in the show it is a lot more common for small folk to get sassy and rude with high nobilityeven kings on the other hand book tywin is practical hes not a psychopath like joffrey and will seize opportunities when he sees them we have never really seen him interact with small folk so i guess we dont really know how he would act maybe he would ask a cupbearer her thoughts thats a very robbned stark thing to do so maybe tywin is like that too i dont know i kind of have a feeling the show is trying to make him more likable but maybe thats just coincidence maybe theyre trying to make him even more grey and conflicting whatever either way i like tv  book tywin but im just trying to figure out if hes really that different from book tywin or if its just a side of him we havent seen in the books"
"Bastard of Boston",2012-04-30,"it kind of amuses as in dumbfounds me how people are still so upinarms over this commoners cannot speak to the highborn this way mentality it began last week with talisa and robb and now i feel like its gotten to the point where people are not even allowing themselves to appreciate electric acting because of it as if we truly cant suspend disbelief on this issue when we can just as easily allow our imaginations to accept dragons and magic but no we cannot accept that tywin and arya would interactthe reason why arya was allowed to speak so brazenly to tywin is simple the scene was electric the actors were exceptional the tension was palpable and it was a moment these shows exist for whats the point in having two talents like charles dance and maisie williams if theyre not even allowed to address one anotheris it really so hard to suspend disbelief for 5 minutes and assume tywin allowed aryas impudence because hes amused by it this man  who so often seems like hes bored with everything  might genuinely be entertained by this little girl who poses absolutely no threat to him at least in his eyes this show should be encouraged to showcase these moments with its talented cast"
"Laohu",2012-04-30,"i wish i had more to add to the discussion here since this was probably my favorite scene from episode 5 but it seems like most of you have already covered all the points i have to make bottom line tywin is not going to take any threat from this little girl that seriously regardless of how impressed he is with the size of the balls she has i mean wow holy shit maisies arya is simply amazing that does not take anything away from charles dance either his glare of death would have made me looking like hot pie after he narrowly avoided getting picked for torture the aryatywin scenes together are simply captivating i am going to savor every moment they have at harrenhal together i am definitely looking forward to seeing where they take this relationship next episode"

"WildlingGirl",2012-05-01,"it kind of amuses as in dumbfounds me how people are still so upinarms over this commoners cannot speak to the highborn this way mentality the reason why arya was allowed to speak so brazenly to tywin is simple the scene was electric the actors were exceptional the tension was palpable and it was a moment these shows exist for whats the point in having two talents like charles dance and maisie williams if theyre not even allowed to address one anotheris it really so hard to suspend disbelief for 5 minutes and assume tywin allowed aryas impudence because hes amused by it this man  who so often seems like hes bored with everything  might genuinely be entertained by this little girl who poses absolutely no threat to him at least in his eyes this show should be encouraged to showcase these moments with its talented castthistywin doesnt perceive arya as a threat he doesnt know who she is he only sees a terrified young peasant girl with enough brains to poster as a boy so as to avoid being raped and killed hes amused by that and willing to explore just why she did it i always saw tywin as interested in people out of the ordinary as he perceives himself to be and bored by the mediocrity around himeven if tywin suspected who she was however shed only have motive in his eyes but highborn girls are no assassins  theyre bred to wed and bear children and are not taught how to be independent and survivorshence tywin in my view would never perceive a little girl as a threat he keeps her around for amusement purposessimple a little girl gave him the answeranybody can be killed his snakecold stare at her didnt seem to me that he was hearing a personal threat from herit seemed to me that he was hearing an idea anybody can be killed honestly i saw in his eyes the wheels gears cogs we see in the opening credits gears within gears plans within plans anybody can be killed tywin heard it from a northerner and he took it inbegan to work with it wow i didnt think of this but i think youre bang on the money iheartseverus chills"

"Onion Smuggler",2012-05-01,"being a bit of a purist i actually dont think that scene was that out of place granted tywin has replaced roose but he asked her what she thought firstly she didnt want to reveal she was a northerner obviously tywin knew otherwise but it was understandable she didnt want to reveal that he then asks what the northerners say about robb so she answers and he asks again what she thinks she gives him an honest answer i think the grrms tywin would respect the courage she showed to speak to him"
"Independent George",2012-05-01,"i think were imputing our knowledge into the characters the reason anyone can be killed is so chilling is because we can read so many different meanings into the it based on what we know of the characters and the story because we know its arya the stabbity stark as they put it at twop of course we see the veiled threat as she stares him down coldly but neither tywin nor any of his council have any way of knowing this or any reason to suspect that shes not merely answering his question and referring to robb to say that a lord would punish a commoner for the threat misses the point he doesnt know its a threat he cant know its a threat we know something tywin doesnt and that turns the meaning of what he just heard completely on its head the whole reason the scene works on such a visceral level is because both of the way both meanings collide with each other"
"LifeRuiner",2012-05-01,"i dont think that arya came off as blatantly threatening it might have looked like it from our omniscient view but not to tywin it looked more like tywin had a doubt about whether the little girl was saying what the little girl couldnt possibly be saying and as if he thought about how true her words were a brilliant scene in the end"
"7V3N",2012-05-01,"you know what wierd when arya lies to tywin about her identity everyone says its understandable yet if talisajeyne maybe im wrong and she is telling the truth lies to robb everyone says its stupid kind of double standardits different robb was in the west tywin was not in the north robb expects the people he encounters to be from the west while tywin doesnt expect many northerners in the riverlands people i mean not soldiers if talisajeyne said she was a westerner robb would see her as just another while arya stands out to tywin because of the lack of northerners south of the neck"
"Strider",2012-05-01,"i loved the scene and disagree almost completely with those who think it was out of character for tywin to allow aryas implied threat to go unpunished quite the contrary its precisely because tywin is so confident in his power and position that he can ignore aryas comment a weaker person might have felt offended but tywin is beyond such pettiness except perhaps where it concerns tyrion i suspect that he admired ayras spunk especially after the display of weakness by his kinsman tywin is powerful enough to respect strength and courage in others arya is no threat to him having winkled out from her that she is a northerner he might be a bit more on his guard not because he fears for his safety but in order to protect against any spying indeed it probably amuses him to keep a spunky northerner kid around if only to remind himself of the quality of his enemies he will not underestimate them again i like the suggestion that aryas remark may in fact be the seed for the idea of the red wedding one more unintended consequence in a world of unintended consequences"
"Ser Greguh",2012-05-01,"wait people are actually expecting that tywin freaking lannister the richest most powerful lord in the seven kingdoms to interpret the statement of anyone can be killed as a threat the man is arrogance personified the thought that a lowly cupbearer is even capable of threatening him would never even occur to himit was a fantastic scene it speaks to aryas state of mind shows tywins pragmatism and sets up an epic moment a few episodes down the road when tywin learns that arya escaped and puts it together"

"legba11",2012-05-01,"what exactly should tywin do in that situation what kind of fool would he look like if he acknowledges a threat from a little girl he would lose face if he reacted to her at all which is why he just stared back then dismissed her on a secondary note he held her up as how lorchs men are bunch of fools if it turns out it was a mistake to have taken her in he would look twice the fool he just made them out to be the mighty tywin lannister being threatened by a little servant girl is a much more dangerous thing to have public than just ignoring the comment small men in power joffery cersei reacted harshly to every small thing truly powerful men tywintyrionrobb know when its important to flex their muscle"

"lyvyathan",2012-05-01,"while i love these two actors i thought the scene was terrible and blatantly insulting to the spirit of martins work changing things from the books is fine altering characters and plots can be necessary for the sake of the show but a ridiculous scene like this goes against the basic core nature of these storieseveryone in the room would have felt that tension a peasant girl just lied to the lord of casterly rock revealed she was actually from the north and then stared him down there was as you saidwhich was obvious to all of us watching and certainly would have been apparent to lord tywin and his reaction to that is to put her in charge of what he drinks absurd this felt like something that belonges in a summer blockbuster not a brutally honest story that gives us neds death and the red weddingi often find myself drawing comparisons between game of thrones and the wire because the wire is one of the few shows ive ever seen on television that approaches the level of complexity and intelligence found in the asoiaf novels in one episode of the wire a leading drug dealer played by the famous and charismatic rapper method man and his people are meeting with another criminal to make a business deal method mans character starts giving a dramatic speech about how all the other players in the drug game in town have fallen except for him hes got a pistol in his hand with all eyes are focused on him the biggest man in the room saying that now it is his time and is halfway through a sentence when one of his subordinates pulls out a gun and blows a hole through his skullasoiaf has always been honest it isnt the place where children get to make cool speeches and the whole room sits back and says damn that was dramatic that little kid sure is a badass anyone can be killed and when youre a peasant lying to staring down and threatening lord tywin lannister shield of lannisport and warden of the west youre killed pretty quicklyi hear what you are saying and in part i agree with it it does seem foolish and not in character for tywin to have arya as his cup bearer  made even more so when it seems obvious he realized she was not a peasant girl but someone from the north  and probably of noble born  given her speech and her distinct lack of fear her first encounter with him already marked him out as she just stood there  staring at him in the prison pensince tywin was a very smart man he probably figured her out as noble born and from the north too etc whose parents were probably killed by his troopsbut it does help the storyline to have him and her side by side in the same roomwhile it does not seem plausible to us  it does make for good drama and you know what really makes him excited it is to see masie williams aryas acting with dance tywin  both are such superior actors and wow can masie act in the hands of a lesser actor  ie the kid who played anakin in star wars1  it would have been embrassing to watchbut look at them to see williams hold her own against dance who is a vastly older actor is simply gold casterly rock gold thats worth the price of admission imhoif i had written that hbo scene  i still would have tywin choosing arya but not as cup bearer but as a page boy  it would have shown a more humane compassionate part of tywin than a simply ruthless cold blooded warlord hey even hitler liked dogs and children smilepng classbbcemoticon alt "

"sbjackdaw",2012-04-30,"i like the actress but the look of the mask was a surprise to me its repeatedly described as a red lacquer mask in the books i imagined it like a japanese kabuki theatre type mask but all red her show mask has a serious sm kind of vibe"
"Ser Giant",2012-04-30,"yeah i dont even remember how i pictured her in my mind back then this creepyodd mask works really well for me though"
"Hyper",2012-04-30,"i liked the mask exotic and cool yet unsettling"
"Morrigan",2012-04-30,"didnt like the mask much thought it looked goofy but i was still glad to see quaithe she had a cool voice"
"Ferrum Aeternum",2012-04-30,"i liked the quaithe bitshe seemed weird and mysterious almost alien which is the exact vibe you want to achieve with that characterincidentally i didnt make the gimp mask connection at all until a ton of folks on twitter and half the people here made that comparison so now ill never be able to look at her the same way again thanks a lot pervs tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp "
"Fez",2012-04-30,"since her original appearance was cut i assumed she wasnt in the show particularly since in the books it doesnt appear that dany ever actually will go east first so i was pleasantly surprised to see her i really liked the mask too"
"catstory",2012-04-30,"thanks for the answer did we know that she was cast if not i wonder if this means that the reeds might still have a chance of being in this season and their casting was just not announced i can imagine them coming in to befriend bran right before theon gets there and then helping him escape i cant wait for the house of the undying scene and am i wrong in thinking ser barristan and strong belwas will also come in at the end of this season"

"Greenseer Stark",2012-04-30,"also agree that quaithe looked mysterious and the voice was awesome but a red mask would have really set it off"
"Arkash",2012-04-30,"i too really liked quaithe and since shes somehow visually easily reminded i guess the showrunners are setting her future dreamy apperances with dany"

"aimlessgun",2012-04-30,"cool mask but not quaithes mask her mask needed to be a solid red lacquer mask that shows absolutely nothing of her face and i expected the rest of her clothing to cover up her body as well so that for all we knew you were talking to a shadow wearing a suit of clothing good voice though imo"

"Arkash",2012-04-30,"yeah i noticed too the hexagonal pattern i find this excellent to link the two women and slip a glimpse of asshaa in the show"
"aimlessgun",2012-04-30,"and the beautiful eyesmmm yeah it would have been a pity to waste those eyes"
"TeemuOfHouseSelanne",2012-05-01,"my first thought at seeing her was that all the will theywont they go to asshai debate is basically settled quaithe is a character who they could very easily not include in the tv series and the story wouldnt be altered to this point in the books the writers have to at least have some sense of where grrm is going with the story and id think if he wasnt going to take dany to asshai then they wouldnt bother including quaithe that being said sometimes the only thing that gets me through some of the drier dany chapter is hoping against hope quaithe will appear and give us a little mythology hint so im really glad to see her on the show also lookswise yeah its not the mask i always pictured but shes clearly a very beautiful woman so ashara dayneshiera seastar still on the table in my mind"
"Laohu",2012-05-01,"dany is going to asshai news to me but that would help clarify the point of quaithe and her reason for existence in grrms world she has quite a shroud of mystery about her in the books and i see the tv show has treated her the same do we hear from her against before adwd"

"Francis Buck",2012-04-30,"for the record they can still introduce the reeds in season three"
"Ser Loudmouth",2012-04-30,"the rumor that ive seen on the internet so far is that they are replacing the reeds with osha because the actress has a large fan base personally i dont see what the big deal is with natalia teena to me she looks like a poor mans helena bonham carter and i didnt particularly liked that one either me i liked the reeds and the two little frey children too they spiced up brans storyline and im sad that they have been cut"
"Somnus",2012-04-30,"well we can still have the reeds in season 3 im okay with the tvshow messing with minor characters like weezethe ticklersmarilion and rakharo but the reeds and ramsay snow are too important to be ignored especially meera since shes bran first love i think that their appearance will be delayed to season 3 like damphair was or else who will go with rickon  maester luwin "
"Milcov",2012-04-30,"not a great decision using osha is also the reason for another of my huge pet hates yara but most importantly its going to change howland reed to a complete total shock when he finally comes into it we havent seen the toj and now we arent getting the reeds so if rlj itll just come as a hammerblow with not even the subtlest of clues in the tv show the reeds should be in it just to get a mention of howland i understand the toj likely wasnt in for casting reasons but surely they could do the reeds"
"Myrddin",2012-04-30,"as much as i love the reeds in the book im completely fine with them being left out of the show especially with how they are eventually treated in dance and since we still havent met howland reed to justify spending screen time on that connection they are brans mentors and guides to the north no more showosha can teach bran and lead him to cold hands and then take rickon to skaggos at the end of the day nothing has changed in the main narrative nonbook viewers wont miss the reeds just us i hope theres another way to work in the tale of the laughing knight edited by myrddin 30 april 2012  0911 am"
"Social Justice Bass",2012-04-30,"without the green dreams theres really no need for the reeds in the story jojens role was mostly to serve as mr exposition on some of the magic to bran through his green dreams since bran is the one having those the only issue is how he and rickon are going to split up after winterfell gets burned"

"CrypticWeirwood",2012-04-30,"i strongly doubt theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>ll let luwin live some other may must be found"
"Tourniquet",2012-04-30,"the reeds are unnecessary i suspect luwin will live also"
"zippypoodle",2012-04-30,"for the record they can still introduce the reeds in season threeyes theres no reason the reeds cant be waiting for bran after the fall of winterfell since jojen has prophectic powersthat being said i hope they dont because jojen reed is one of my topthree least favorite characters in the entire series"
"bloodymime",2012-04-30,"no tower of joy flashback from ned so i dont hold much hope for the knight of the laughing tree either cant even really blame them for cutting the reeds as much as i like them cuts out two extra actors from the budget and they have to be practical about the fact they have natalia teena as osha shes most likely getting paid a lot of money and brings in name power not just as primarily a film actress but someone from the harry potter films and yes i know theres at least one person who only started watching game of thrones exclusively because shes a huge potter fan and loved natalia teena in them considering shes the only harry potter fan i know im going to assume there are others so theyre left with two choices suddenly start making up a lot of rickon scenes that never happen in the books to keep teena onscreen or they have to send her with bran because its hard to see them sending off natalia teena to not be seen again for who knows how many books worth of the show unless she leaves the series on her own accord"
"Ser Giant",2012-04-30,"kind of makes me care less about bran tbh but thats strictly because i read the books first this really makes me think that they are preparing to end the show with a storm of swords unless howland never makes an appearance in the booksi really feell he needs to eventually his children really need to show up at some point or someone else with a relationship to him if howland reed never shows up or they end the show with asos itll workout just fine"
"Tall Tyrion Lannister!",2012-04-30,"they could always have them meet the reeds later on im not sure whos gonna go with rickon if they are split up edited by completely headless ned 30 april 2012  1025 am"
"Strider",2012-04-30,"popular opinion is that osha will accompany bran and hodor north of the wall while luwin will survive theons occupation and take rickon to white harbor and skaagosi think this would be a smart decision members of this forum have already observed how difficult it has become in the second season for the show to maintain the interest of the viewers with the the introduction of so many plot threads this problem of fragmentation is only going to get worse hence its important to maintain dramatic continuity by keeping alive alreadyintroduced minor characters and only to introduce new characters as needed the reeds simply are not necessary as interesting as they are for book readers osha will guide bran to the wall and beyond and introduce him to the old ways it also makes sense to keep luwin alive and entrust rickons future to him whatever part howland reed has to play in the in the future narrative both in the book and the tv show assuming the show survives that long doubtful his children are not necessary to that part"
"Lors' Edrick",2012-04-30,"i hate to admit it but i personally think that the characters of bran rickon hodor hodor and osha will all be traveling together to the wall just from the perspective of the books we havent heard from rickon or osha since they split up minus the knowledge that they are possibly in skagos the characters have to stay together i guess just for the continuity of the storyline maester luwin cant not survive for many claring reasons but first and foremost his advanced age is to unbelievable to make any knid of escape or long winded journey"
"Ser_Niall",2012-04-30,"while the reed children make interesting characters in the books at the end of the day theyre relatively minor characters in the narrative they are basically brans tutors teaching him about old magics and green dreams it often happens in booktomovie adaptations that several minor characters get spun into one characters and this time it looks like its osha i dont really mind the change since it doesnt effect the spirit of the story if the show lasts to cover all of the books and the reed children happen to become more important to the story then the writers could definitely figure out a creative way of introducing them at that time"
"ViennaGirl",2012-04-30,"no wex with theon eitheryeah and he was kind of useful in book 5 i think osha can fill in for the reeds in terms of taking bran north and someone else random can take rickon but as far as backstory and future story im not so sure maybe were all wrong about toj and howland and it all doesnt mean anything"
"Chipster92",2012-04-30,"personally i never cared too much for the reeds in the books they were basically walking plot devices who were only around for exposition purposes they didnt seem to have much personalities of their own the green dreams being given to bran in my opinion is an excellent way of streamlining an already jampacked narrative having osha the wilding stick around is good since 1the audience already knows her 2it would make perfect sense for her to know about stuff thats beyond the wall and 3 there wouldnt be any time wasted introducing two new child characters who in my opinion arent at all interesting and dont amount to much that time can be used to properly develop other characters who got shortshrifted in the books keeping maester luwin around longer can also give the opportunity to get across more backstory using a character who is already familiarif they absolutely have to have one of the reeds there it should just be meera edited by chipster92 30 april 2012  1140 am"
"WinterWarrior",2012-04-30,"i think the reeds can still be introduced in season 3 it looks like they are definitely out for season 2 my fear is there are too many dark characters and not enough good people in the tv show cutting out the reeds eliminates a couple of good characters that are needed to balance out all of the darknes in the show but i am really enjoying the tv series so i will leave it to the writers"
"Bastard of Boston",2012-04-30,"one good thing to come out of jojen and meeras cut is the possibility that luwin will live as someone mentioned i love luwin on the show edited by bastard of boston 30 april 2012  1139 am"
"Bastard of Lannister",2012-04-30,"maybe they will introduce the reeds in season 3 and have them see the burning of winterfell hide and run into bran later they could say we came because i had a dream of the ocean crashing over the waves of winterfell and bran is like omg me too lets be buds i hope osha goes away because    i dont really like her character and the books have an awesome plot small changes like ros the whore in the show arent too annoying particularly because of the play with her ass scene but not including the reeds is a mistake and it would just really make the show suffer"
"Strider",2012-04-30,"i hate to admit it but i personally think that the characters of bran rickon hodor hodor and osha will all be traveling together to the wall just from the perspective of the books we havent heard from rickon or osha since they split up minus the knowledge that they are possibly in skagos the characters have to stay together i guess just for the continuity of the storyline maester luwin cant not survive for many claring reasons but first and foremost his advanced age is to unbelievable to make any knid of escape or long winded journeyi thought of that too having rickon join bran on the journey north would alter the narrative but for the purpose of the show that might not be a bad thing and i take your point about luwin being too old perhaps to successfully take charge of rickonperhaps but i still think it would be best to keep him alive rickon needs to be put in the charge of someone we already know rather than inventing a new character at this point imho"
"Patchface12",2012-04-30,"i think they will appear in season 3 but the 3 eyed crow will have sent them to escort bran north i also think the blackfish and edmure will appear next season as well i think most cut characters are simply being held off until they become more important and thus easier for the audience to rememberthe only characters that seem to have been cut for good are donal noye chett and cleos frey"

"dansnow",2012-04-30,"it saddens me because i consider osha to be a much more minor character than the reeds and im not a huge fan of the actress at all but i get why they have to make changes like this and how her actress brings in viewers so ill just cross my fingers for season 3"
"Ser Giant",2012-04-30,"for me its because there have been no reeds and no ramsey snow and obviously because its just speculation i was just thinking they may actually kill rickon and just have bran hodor and osha hide in the crypts this would suck because shaggydog is my fav dw but it would streamline everything in the north and make things more focused"
"IceVyper",2012-04-30,"they may appear in the 3rd season besides books 4 and 5 can give for plenty of seasons without the reeds or ramsay i think they skipped the reeds because they dont want to have too many kids and osha can easily replace them ramsay on the other hand might as well show up they just need a really awesome actor and they may just not want to waste someone in this season for a few minutes of screen time"
"Fez",2012-04-30,"popular opinion is that osha will accompany bran and hodor north of the wall while luwin will survive theons occupation and take rickon to white harbor and skaagosi could see that and it would make sense i think andy greenwald over grantland really hit on things when he said that game of thrones has a problem of too many great characters and not enough time for them cutting characters where possible and extending the lives of already established minor characters as replacements i think is a great way to deal with that problemnot a great decision using osha is also the reason for another of my huge pet hates yara but most importantly its going to change howland reed to a complete total shock when he finally comes into it we havent seen the toj and now we arent getting the reeds so if rlj itll just come as a hammerblow with not even the subtlest of clues in the tv show the reeds should be in it just to get a mention of howland i understand the toj likely wasnt in for casting reasons but surely they could do the reedsconsidering grrm has told dan and david all the major beats that will come in the last two books maybe we should take this as a sign that rlj isnt true or more likely that it is true but it doesnt ever amount to anything a situation where jon is told oh by the way and he says doesnt matter im still a man of the nights watchstill a stark and lord of winterfell depending on how he interprets his oaths after being brought back from the dead"
"Ser Hippie",2012-04-30,"given dds comments about pushing some characters back to season 3 im guessing the reeds or at least one of them is included there along with ramsayreek"
"Myrddin",2012-04-30,"considering grrm has told dan and david all the major beats that will come in the last two books maybe we should take this as a sign that rlj isnt true or more likely that it is true but it doesnt ever amount to anything a situation where jon is told oh by the way and he says doesnt matter im still a man of the nights watchstill a stark and lord of winterfell depending on how he interprets his oaths after being brought back from the deadassuming rlj is true and that howland reed will be the eventual person to reveal this the reed kids arent needed to set this up at allwhenever howland decides to drag his ass into the story season 68 in the show he will just pop out of the bushes to jon or whomever and say i rode with ned some established character will then say hes right i vouch for himthen howland will tell his tale sure there wont be much set up in this scenario but aside from this forum how many readers do you think are waiting for this guy to appear on the scene from the few brief mentions across 5 books and 15 years"
"Francis Buck",2012-04-30,"dont you need at least one reed for the trek north who is bran going to talk to hodor it will be reminicent to tom hanks talking to wilson for the entire journeyi think this is the biggest piece of evidence in favor of the reeds showing up in season three no matter how you cut it bran needs someone to go north with him other than hodor and even if they were to have osha or luwin both of which complicate things especially for rickon go along that still means that bran only has one person to talk to forwhat the next two seasons and then coldhands at the end it just doesnt work and id bet any amount of money that rickon isnt going with bran theres a reason he was sent to skagos and theres a reason davos is going there to get him it makes no sense for him to go north as well i honestly think the reeds are a shoein its not like it would be confusing or cluttered since the only storyline theyll appear in is brans and the dynamic between those three characters is essential for his journey and who knows how theyll fit in later on in the story the only reason theyre not in this season is because they dont have to be they do nothing in the second book that cant be easily replaced by luwin and osha though is not at all true for the third book and bran having jojens dreams doesnt mean they cut jojen forever it just means they cut jojen this season and needed someone to have the dreams so yeah im pretty damn confidant that both reed will children show up next season"
"Fez",2012-04-30,"so yeah im pretty damn confidant that both reed will children show up next seasoni know dan and david have said that some characters have been pushed back from season 2 to season 3 but right now were short on the tullys ramsay the reeds barristan and strong belwas maybe not sure on them actually and the brave companions between all of them as well as the characters who are supposed to first appear in season 3 thats a crazy number of new characters to introduce i doubt all of them will be and i can easily see the reeds being the ones cut particularly if luwin takes rickon and osha goes with bran its not like brans screen time will pick up much in the next few seasons its possible for him to only really have one talking screen partner for most of that plus there will be the episode where they meet sam and then coldhands which can act as the majorly featured episode for this storyline for that season edited by fez 30 april 2012  0302 pm"
"Brave Ser Robin",2012-04-30,"im completely fine with rolling the reeds into oshas character it makes it much more tv friendly in the books rickon has disappeared completely from the radar ive not idea what grrm has in mind for that character but hes definitely not being setup for anything major the only thing i could think of would be as ultimate heir to house stark when everything blows over if there really is nothing important about his story arc then he could in fact be killed in season 2 without loss"
"Davos55",2012-04-30,"i am still holding onto hope that they are introduced in season 3 i personally do like them and i feel that they make brans storyline more interesting and fun to read brans storyline in acok pretheon may not be exciting fast paced entertainment but i love it nonetheless i think the reeds are great on brans journey north and i love his interactions with them especially meera i also dont really like osha on the show or in the book and i dont see what the big deal with her is was her acting this episode really that great that would be interesting if maester luwin survives and takes rickon but i dont understand the logistics of that also where is shaggy dog this year in the overall picture i think a better question may be where are little walder big walder and ramsayreek"
"Lord Varys",2012-04-30,"its obvious that rickon stark is going to become an important figurehead in twow and ados bran is not going to become important on the political field he is on his way to become a tree rickon is the books for a reason and is in the tv series for a reason despite the fact that osha could take the place of the reeds im still not sure she will with old nan gone and luwin playing the role of the antimagic guy osha has to be the person bran talks to about his dreams and stuff but this does as of yet not mean that she will take bran back north beyond the wall after all the tv series established that osha has no intention whatsoever to return beyond the wall due to her fear of the others so i cant possible imagine she will take that risk more so as of yet no one seems to think that bran should go beyond the wall i guess this issue will only come up in season 3 after bran has successfully left winterfell i very much doubt well explore the threeeyed crow all that much this season there is no time theyll have to deal with the theonbranrelationship in the next couple of episodes and im convinced that will only reveal the fact that the stark children survived in the very end of this season which means that bran rickon and osha are not going to have much screen time left"
"Ser Giant",2012-04-30,"would people really quit watching the show if an actor from the harry potter movies left for several seasons seems like got didnt suffer from sean bean leaving i dont know the exact numbers but bean is a much more wellknown actor i think it would be smart of the producers to send osha with rickon if she is an expensive actor to hire it would free up funds for other things next season besides she doesnt get that much screen time asis and if they really love her that much i would love to see updates to rickons journey anyways"

"Marjie Eilie Myatt",2012-04-30,"i know ive said this elsewhere before but the reeds can be encountered later even though geographically it probably wont make sense or they can be cut for simplicitys sakebut to say they must be cut for budget ignores the fact that there are plenty of unnecessary whores still on the payroll and hbo appears to be saving money on battle scenes so fardont miss the walder boys one bit"

"_Oberyn_",2012-04-30,"the child actor problem is just a lame excuse meera is not a child and jojen can be cut by tranfering his abilities to meera there is no excuse for not having at least one reed in season 3"
"Patchface12",2012-04-30,"i have a feeling the skaggs and rickon with them will play a major part in this i think maybe osha will take rickon to skagos but bran will initially leave with just hodor but having had a 3 eyed crow dream beforehand that tells him hes sent someone to escort bran to north thus giving us a lead in to jojen and meera in the following season maybe they wont even be howlands kids just as jeyne robbs soon to be love interest is not a westerling or even highborn tho its possible they would be howland did train with the men on the isle of faces its possible he would send his kids off to stay with the last greenseer edited by patchface12 30 april 2012  0904 pm"
"Catastrophy",2012-04-30,"bran has only 4 chapters in asos and 4 in adwd i dont think we will see him much in show also so they can skip getting two more actors and go to the wall with both osha and rickon and beyond the wall with coldhands sending osha and rickon where they need to go"
"Laohu",2012-04-30,"hmm i found maester luwins death a rather poignant scene in the books although these books do not lack for deaths of likable characters i felt that the parting of the ways for the winterfell group with luwins death had a huge impact  for obvious reasons i would be slightly disappointed if they changed that in the show and allowed luwin to survive the aftermath at winterfell"
"teemo",2012-04-30,"the absence of the reeds is definitely one of the saddest parts of the show are they expendable sure brans powers can still be realized without the reeds but theres a lot of things about the reeds that i find very important and profound i loved how bran showed some of his father by being so respectful to the reeds and was genuinely interested in everything they had to say regardless of how odd others found them i thought it was a great show of brans character and i think jojen in particular could have been great tv dressed up in all green with green eyes and lookingacting like a little grandfather with his green dreams could have been fascinating to viewers but i get it hbo probably cares the least about brans story for two reasons 1 its one of the most fantastical povs in the books and 2 hes a kid and hes not a little badass like arya and of course there isnt room for everyone but still  sad plus bran and meera are ending up together didnt you know"
"houseHB",2012-04-30,"they can introduce the reeds in season 3 as well if they really wanted to bran rickon osha and hodor can be wandering around and jojen and meera show up jojen can say he had one of his green dreams and that is where osha separates with rickon and shaggydog and bran hodor and summer go with meera and jojen"
"tfoxx22",2012-04-30,"i was fairly disappointed by their exclusion with that being said i think it would be interesting if they did somehow insert them into season 3"
"piratesswoop",2012-04-30,"i really dont understand logistically how they could have maester luwin taking rickon they dont have horses if i remember and im not sure how an old guy like maester luwin would be expected to travel on foot alone with a six or seven year old child that would just make them a prime target at least osha has some fighting skill and probably has some handy wildling skills obviously a maester is going to be intelligent but i still think putting rickon in the care of maester luwin for a lengthy journey would just be asking for trouble"
"Frumpus",2012-05-01,"my guess is that they want to write bran and rickon out as soon as possible because the actors will get too old so they plan on getting bran to the north with hodor osha and rickon will either be with them or get killed off is the rickonoshadavos storyline even going to be important in the sixth book i have a feeling itll be like another theon storyline great and emotional read but ultimately unimportant to the overall storyline"
"ShadowRaven",2012-05-01,"the reeds are definitely an important element and im baffled they actually cut them for this season they are ignoring a lot of brans storyline like the walders and ramsay right around this part ramsay should be somewhere in the dungeons its like theyre cutting a lot of important cast members of brandany storyline and not for the rest really unfair edited by shadowraven 01 may 2012  0412 am"

"WinterWarrior",2012-05-01,"in sundays episode ghost of harrenhall it was bran who had the dream of the sea coming over the walls of winterfell which in the book is a dream that jojen had so i think they may have bran being the green seer earlier in the story and someone else taking him up north of the wall i think the reeds will either show up in season 3 maybe just meera or not at all as far as rickon goes i think he will be very important in the next two books and will be the only stark at winterfell by the time grrm gets that last book out hoping he lives long enough to finish the books the story line of davos being sent by lord too fat to sit a horse to find rickon seems to me to be the next big movement in the stark story and sophie turner is an excellent sansa  she is perfect for the part but that has nothing to do with this thread and yes wasting time on ros is unthinkable i hope the writers are listening before they write season 3 edited by winterwarrior 01 may 2012  0806 am"

"kevinbgwrites",2012-05-01,"point with ros is shes invented and isnt a great addition is she particularly problematic no but her scenes take away from scenes such as stannis red bird scene a scene explaining why stannis is even south with renly etc and as such his character has suffered given that theyve added ros there is definitely no place for two more characters that can be comfortably cut because then stannisother characters would suffer even more the wights were foreshadowed coldhands and many other non ww resurrections are not and coupled with stuff like house of the undying and coldhands might prove to be too much my point wasnt that i want him to be cut but i could see how they could use osha and brans dreams to cut him if they deemed it needed"
"Francis Buck",2012-05-01,"also as i said before the reeds dont really clutter things the way other characters might brave companions tullys etc literally every single reed scene would also be a bran scene they never interact with anyone else in the series so its not like theyre going to need to cut back and forth to them all the timeand cutting coldhands is just plain silly much for the same reason edited by francis buck 01 may 2012  0544 pm"

"madman2711",2012-05-03,"come on jojen and meera are brans companions they must be in we can addapt it and maybe just put one reed that is a mix af both of them but no reed is plain awful cut some of the lf whores for some reeds or at least put some newsflash like the reeds are on the way to winterfell did peter jackson cut samwell and sent pippin to mordor with frodo i think not"
"Tomer",2012-05-03,"ive started to accept that the reeds will be cut prolly even though id miss jojen but ramsay simply cannot be cut also cillian murphy is the perfect actor for him"
"Ser Desmond Wine's Bane",2012-05-03,"hi all  been lurking for a while and just started posting i like meera and jojen purely for the fact that i am invested in brans story arc i think most fans can remember that point in the book where they became hooked and for me it was in the middle brans pov chapter talking about his climbing all over the castle i was deeply hooked long before he fell as a result i really wanted to see meera and jojen appear but  i fully recognise the arguments above about the relevance of those characters its perfectly apparent that the role of brans guide can be carried out by one person in the tv series and i can even accept that osha be that person as long as rickons journey is handled suitably the thing is i have wondered for some months whether the reeds would be left out entirely rather than be pushed out to s3 the thing the pointed me this way is the map included with the blueray of season 1 greywater watch is completely absent another possible hint is in s2e15 where renly says to catelyn robb may hold title to all lands north of moat cailin surely if the reeds were to be in some way important then he would have recognised robbs lordship over the neck and therefore greywater watch  i hope meera and jojen or a combined character appear in s3 but i fear it wont happen"
"Lord of Brewtown",2012-05-03,"yes theres no reason the reeds cant be waiting for bran after the fall of winterfell since jojen has prophectic powersthat being said i hope they dont because jojen reed is one of my topthree least favorite characters in the entire seriesthen you are probably not going to like how the series ends when bran thwarts danys invasion and rewards jojen for his loyaltyservice by giving him dany to serve in his harem"

"jugdesh258",2012-05-04,"the rumor that ive seen on the internet so far is that they are replacing the reeds with osha because the actress has a large fan base personally i dont see what the big deal is with natalia teena to me she looks like a poor mans helena bonham carter and i didnt particularly liked that one eitherme i liked the reeds and the two little frey children too they spiced up brans storyline and im sad that they have been cutwhile i think the writers might be invested in the character and would rather not have her dissappear for a number of episodes i surely hope that they could care less about focus group and fan base hard to believe that grrm would involve himself in anything like spagetti storyline line lost with his books you cant just suddenly decide everyone is a cylonmy feeling would be that serires will definately be cancelled before the book story can unfold in that messy scenario"
"jugdesh258",2012-05-04,"its obvious that rickon stark is going to become an important figurehead in twow and ados bran is not going to become important on the political field he is on his way to become a treewe discussed briefly in the similar thread from last week i think this is why the meera character is important bran dreams of a life with meera eating frogs but has to deal with sacrifice to live on in agony forever merged with the tree to save all of humanity kind of like the god emperor"
"Jennelyn",2012-05-04,"i really cant see anyone but osha taking rickon to skaagos why on earth would maester luwin since we dont know how important rickon going to skaagos is we cant really speculate on whether or not hell go there in the show we also dont really know how important it is for the boys to be separated since that plot line hasnt been reconciled in the books yet i could see rickon being hidden at white harbor so maybe thats what will happen or perhaps osha takes bran to the 3 eyed crow leaves him there and proceeds on with rickon to skaagos since the writers are able to speak with grrm about major future plot points im sure theyll figure something out that makes sense im not convinced that the reeds wont appear in the next season but if they dont im sure something will be done that wont compromise the end of the story i doubt they are just planning to end it with asos of course they have no guarantees of being able to finish the series to completion but theyve got to stay optimistic im sure"
"Hyper",2012-05-04,"i think the reeds will appear in some form next season why because otherwise there is virtually no story material for the bran plotline to work with for the next two years brans journey in asos is basically a forest trek from winterfell to the wall they could easily have bran  co run into the reeds next year hide out with them while bran is educated more and then continue towards the wall in season 4 another option would be to simply accelerate brans journey in the show he really does not interact with any other characters other than a short meeting with sam so he could reach his tree state earlier in the show which would allow them to cut back on bran appearances just make the occasional guest appearance as needed edited by hyper 04 may 2012  0353 pm"
"Bloody-Nine",2012-05-04,"does this mean bran is going to eat oshapaste when he gets to bloodravens cave"
"House Snow",2012-05-05,"so they released the summary for episode 10 and it seems like master luwin wont be going with bran imo that makes it much more likely that they plan to cast the reeds for season three"

"Direwolf Lager",2012-05-05,"i didnt even realizeno tower of joy flashback from ned so i dont hold much hope for the knight of the laughing tree eithercant even really blame them for cutting the reeds as much as i like them cuts out two extra actors from the budget and they have to be practical about the fact they have natalia teena as osha shes most likely getting paid a lot of money and brings in name power not just as primarily a film actress but someone from the harry potter films and yes i know theres at least one person who only started watching game of thrones exclusively because shes a huge potter fan and loved natalia teena in them considering shes the only harry potter fan i know im going to assume there are othersso theyre left with two choices suddenly start making up a lot of rickon scenes that never happen in the books to keep teena onscreen or they have to send her with bran because its hard to see them sending off natalia teena to not be seen again for who knows how many books worth of the show unless she leaves the series on her own accordharry potter fans should stick to harry potter"

"STANN1SBARATHEON",2012-05-06,"the reeds were a very important part of the books the idea of jojens green dreams always coming true adds to the intrigue and mystery of the story but if they were to cut the reeds out of the show which they have the thing to do would be to get bran to the wall then have coldhands take him and hodor the rest of the way to the three eyed crow oops i mean the three eyed raven now geez am i right anyway that would be the most logical thing to do to sort of stay true to the books that way osha can still take rickon to skaggos and davos can eventually be sent by lord wyman there to bring rickon and his wolf shaggy back to the north like i said this would be the most logical thing to do but knowing television writers and network executives they will probably try to capitalize on the actress playing osha and her popularity she is famous for playing tonks in the harry potter movies and while i enjoy her acting and dont have anything against her personally it would be a shame if her and bran and rickon and hodor all went north of the wall together instead of splitting up as maetser luwin suggested before he dies this means no possible davosrickon storyline all the way down the road when it calls for it in the storyline but i dont think the boys behind thrones would be crazy enough to keep luwin alive and have him with one or both of the boys he needs to die at the end of the season like he does in the book to reinforce the notion that anyone can be killed and no one is safe if they keep him alive and invent new dialogue and storyline for him instead of delving into other aspects of the books i just may loose even more of my enthusiasm for the show for every thing that gets cut from the books for the show be it large or little from renlys peach to danys bloodrider loosing his head always makes me weep a bit"
"Rockroi",2012-05-06,"the reeds are eminently replaceable characters all of their dialog and additions can either 1 be told by other characters osha and bran without any loss in continuity or 2 discarded the reeds are perfects characters in a book in a book you dont have to pay someone to write about this or that character therefore you can enhance the story by adding in a variety of characters and settings without limitation except if you really stretch it ie the iron islands in affc that all works out very well hence in the book the reeds fit very nicely they add depth and structure they add perspective and dimension in a tv show you have ten hours thats it you have to tell your whole story in that strict time frame you also have a budget every actor costs money that can be spent elsewhere thats reality the reeds are ancillary characters that are utterly unimportant but for their relationship with bran well if thats the case can we just add their elements their supporting rolls to other charters i think you can bran has picked up very well from what jojen added osha is going to do enough for meera what can either character do or say that cannot be accommodated for nothing they are strictly supporting characters that have no relevance outside of bran i think in that regard their exclusion is a wise choice given the strict limits of a tv show"
"White Harbors Wrath",2012-05-10,"another thing islook at the truncation of the bran storyline at winterfellthats not because they dont like branits because theres too many other things going on what besides ros would we like them to cut so they could try to explain the reeds now after the fact youve got three episodes left to do it because i dont want them cutting greyjoy and martell storylines next season for psychic swamp children"

"EgoistMusketeer",2012-04-30,"she thinks dany is going to abandon them and lose respect for dothraki culture in this new city thats why she shows her that she sewed up her dothraki clothing she is uncomfortable with danys new dress and she snaps when dany is called queen rather than khaleesi"
"Rockroi",2012-05-01,"we also have to remember that there is some natural sibling rivalry at play with the two women both are serving one queen who only has so much time to spend with either of them both women know that their lives are spent in suplication to dany and without her they are not only out in the cold but their very lives would become imperrilled hence both want to stay within her good graces and the other is in direct competition for danys time its interesting because when a room full of men and women try to keep the attention of a king or a queen its natural but when you shrink that space down to just two women in a small room it becomes far more obvious and tense also do not forget the constant chaffe that goes with travelling a long distance with the same people in close proximity i know that seems minor but these people have been together tightly and inspeperably for a very long time and that whole time they have been close to death there is just natural tension there"

"A Menina Cebola",2012-05-01,"i really like the fact that we get to see more of the handmaidens in the series the relationship between dany and her maids brings out more of danys caring side if i had not read the books i wouldnt really see much of her softer side last season we had her relationship with drogo which showed she had some heart but this season so far shes done a lot of walking and a lot of getting angry and being a strong woman if there wasnt the nice little scenes with doreah and irri i can imagine those watching who hadnt read the books would not get an insight into her thoughts and emotions or the side of dany that mormont is besotted with i also saw their interaction in this episode as a sort of personification of danys inner conflict weve got irri who is completely dothraki and has a strong sense of their culture and embodies their ideals whereas doreah is the outsider doreah embodies the foreign element to dany the part of her that will always be the outsider to the dothraki the back and forth about the dress and fitting in at qarth was like danys inner conflict that we otherwise wouldnt see on screen i dont really feel like irri came off as moody or catty she just stood by her beliefs and her culture and we saw that later on with the issue over melting down the statue its a clash of cultures explored in a visual sense"

"Hyper",2012-05-04,"i dont really see the problem with xaro not being gay the show has clearly not avoided showing gay relationships so they probably did it because they felt it made for a more compelling alternative for dany in the book she really has no intention or desire to marry xaro  it is a bit ridiculous to her edit and to comment on the irridoreah  i like how they are setting up the handmaidens as competing influences on dany like angels on her shoulders and it doesnt hurt that both irri and doreah are very pleasing to the eye coolpng classbbcemoticon altb  edited by hyper 04 may 2012  0508 pm"

"WinterWarrior",2012-05-01,"i was looking for him  i am a huge fan of roy dotrice and had seen the blurb that said he would be hallyne i first read the five books via audiobook i drive extensively and then went back and read the books and am now listening again to the cok audiobook to follow along with season 2 on hbo for me the characters will always be the way they were portrayed by roy dotrice in those audiobooks he did an amazing job i am so glad he had a part in the hbo series so he would be part of the story on film as well and he did an excellent job as hallyne i really feel his audiobook readings of the books are a body of work all their own and worry what will happen if he is not around to tape the audiobook versions of the next two books there will be a real loss of continuity if that happens it is jarring for audiobook readers to have to adjust to a new narrator midstream in a series of booksgrrm needs to get those books out so dotrice can read them before he gets much older is it my imagination or does the hbo tyrion peter dinklage sound exactly like tyrion as dotrice reads him i love that about the hbo series edited by winterwarrior 01 may 2012  0203 pm"

"The Lord Commander's Raven",2012-05-02,"roy dotrice was outstanding in his cameo as the master pyromancer in truth i did not recognize him the first time he looked very different from the last time i saw him on hellboy ii and a lot older than in the cutting edge but i thought his performance particularly his vocal interpretation of the pyromancer was excellent and well acted i only wish he lad a larger role in the series perhaps that of grand maester pycelle but perhaps dotrices age has something to do with that hes a fine actor and would be the among the best in any scene"

"The Lord Commander's Raven",2012-05-02,"yes to all who mentioned roy dotrices audiobook readings he is simply amazing and his many voices give each character a unique life of their own as mentioned previously his characterization of dolores edd is incredible and i like particularly in a storm of swords his vocal renditions of tyrion and jamie lannister similar yet distinct as one might expect with brothers roy is great and i am glad to hear he rerecorded a feast for crowsjon lee was absolutely terrible as the voice over artist"
"Ygrette",2012-05-03,"despite having listened to all 5 books with his voice i did not recognize him what i did recognize though was his hilariousness the character was brilliantly played and much more entertaining than i remember him from the books his refusal to react on any kind of humour was wonderful and hes exactly the kind of person i would expect in a position like this reminds me a lot of my university research times when i had to socialize with folks that has been locked up with books for 60 years may he live long and more specifically and egoistically speaking may he definitely live long enough to do books 6 and 7 or however many there will be in the end"
"WinterWarrior",2012-05-03,"yes he did affc late last year it was released in december 2011 and i love the way he makes tyrion and jamie sound simliar yet distinct exactly how you would expect brothers to sound if you take the hbo tyrion and jamie and put them in a room together they do not speak as if they were raised in the same family  although both are excellent those are the types of subtleties dotrice nails in the audiobooks dolores edd is so well done by dotrice as are the other characters i really like the way he does ygritte even though she is a young girl and his is an older man he portrays her so well i love the way he says you know nothing jon snow he makes walder frey much more in line with a 90 year old man the hbo series makes him look too young i think dotrice nails walder frey with that  he he hebut he does so many characters so well we just cant list them all edited by winterwarrior 03 may 2012  0725 am"

"kli",2012-05-03,"i had totally forgotten he was playing hallyne didnt spot him but halfway through one of his lines i was going wait i recognize that voice its roy dotricesoooo good to see him on a grrm tv show once again i loved the hell out of father on beauty and the beast im showing my age but i once went to a batb creation con in la and dotrice was entirely gracious to all us little fans and just really cool to be around if you havent watched batb the cbs website is actually still hosting a couple of the episodes i recommend promises of someday and im eternally grateful that the beauty and the beast pilot thats being worked on right now for the fall season has nothing to do with the old 80s show"
"WinterWarrior",2012-05-07,"as much as i hate walder frey i think dotrice would have acted that part brilliantly actually he would have acted any of the parts brilliantly"
"Lors' Edrick",2012-04-30,"from the preview of next weeks episode and the vision that bran has water flowing over the walls of winterfell and ser rodrick cassel drowning can it now be understood that there will be no reek  ramsey character involved in the tv series in addition if you caught the preview you will have seen roose bolton delivering a message to king robb about torrens square being attacked will we get a plot where robb will send roose up north to deal with the problem or will roose suggest to send for his sofarasnow unknown bastard ramsey to deal with this problem"
"Jamie Lannister",2012-04-30,"seems possible its still a shame though i was really looking forward to ramsay the liberties theyre taking by robbing him of his defining character moment and the shock twist ending in general are considerable"
"Somnus",2012-04-30,"the boltons will be quite important i think it would be a waste to further reduce a small family like theirs to roose only im sure ramsay will appear theres no way that they can make roose cover both his and ramsays role probably ser rodrick cassel will reach the town that theon attacked realize its a trap go back still in time for his role at least i hope"
"Tony Soprano",2012-04-30,"the boltons become really important characters later on so i hope they havent cut ramsay hes involved in a lot of story arcs theon jon stannis i dont think theyre gonna cut him and i think theres a possibility well see him this season"
"Tourniquet",2012-04-30,"i think they have to include reek so much of theons storyline depends on him and the way that alfie allen has been playing theon is certainly going to have some show presence going forward"
"Brienne the Beauty",2012-04-30,"theyve barely introduced lord bolton yet i imagine we wont see his bastard this season"
"unRobert",2012-04-30,"no way thatll do it for me if roose gets sent north off goes the craptube"
"Chipster92",2012-04-30,"im sure theyre just holding off ramsay until season 3 so alfie allen will get something to do and wont get left out for two seasons they also still have to cast an actor good enough to pull off this character convincingly in the wrong hands the character could come off like an imitation of an overly brutal horror movie villain what with his proclivites for torture and flaying some people nonbook readers have already complained about joffreys cruelty being over the top once this dude comes in i dont what the nooba are gonna think"
"Tadco26",2012-04-30,"ramsay definitely has not been cast this season but whether he can come next season or not is not known i do think the story would be significantly changed if they combine roose and ramsay does that mean roose will never take harrenhal or interact with arya how about his interactions with jaime which help set the foundation for the boltons role in the red wedding the adaptation will further veer into inspired by the books rather than really following them to the degree that season 1 did if they go that far it will be curious who will suggest the killing of the millers boys in place of bran and rickon it seems they have taken liberties to make theon less culpable for his turning on the starks from the burned letter to robb to cleftjaw suggesting they raid something other than fishing villages so it will be quite a shift if theon is the one who comes up with killing the millers kids likewise ramsay being reek to theon and then making theon into reek was a dramatic shift that appears will be lost ramsay is such a great villain and it will be a shame if he is cut"
"Tall Tyrion Lannister!",2012-04-30,"well ramsay being ramsay was a suprise in the book so hopefully its a surprise in the show"
"Carne",2012-04-30,"maybe theyre moving him to season 3 so theon has something to do the last we see of theon this season might be his capture of winterfell"
"Ice Turtle",2012-04-30,"truth to be told i can imagine ramsay and roose put into one person one villain instead of two though it would mean no story about fat waldas dowry because it would be roose who marries arya"
"Jamie Lannister",2012-04-30,"maybe theyre moving him to season 3 so theon has something to do the last we see of theon this season might be his capture of winterfellwell episode eight  is called the prince of winterfell and weve seen bran and rickons corpses strung up on stark banners in one of the trailers its safe to say he conquers it in s2 and asha comes to visit him tooi suppose roose could dispense his son to go and take back winterfell while he takes over harrenhal but eh hed have been seen or seeded by now ive lost all hope for seeing ramsay this season edited by jamie lannister 30 april 2012  1056 am"
"Patchface12",2012-04-30,"maybe theon and dagmar defeat rodrick cassels army and capture and drown him the same way they defeated the wild hares in the book and drowned benfrey tallhart if thats the case then only ramsays forces show up at winterfell maybe theon and co surrender to them only so ramsay can slaughter all ironborn prisoners but theon and burn winterfell"
"Meg Stark",2012-04-30,"maybe theyre moving him to season 3 so theon has something to do the last we see of theon this season might be his capture of winterfelli think they will likely kill bran and rickon this season it would make for a great cliffhanger they dont necessarily need ramseyreek for that part they can just bring him in season 3 to move theons story along and show him loosing winterfell then though it would be a great surprise if they somehow managed to surprise us all with ramsey appearing in one of the next episodes"
"WolveseatDragons",2012-04-30,"one thing that is already going to be lost most certainly is ramsays early story i dont know how they can go through the rest of the season without him without a major shift that said id be fine with putting the winterfell stuff on the slow burn story wise to advance the other areas its going to be interesting to see how they put it together"
"NewJeffCT",2012-04-30,"i think they could introduce reek similar to how they had jaqen rorge  biter last year in the cage  a nondescript extra who stinks and was released from the dungeons beneath winterfell when theon hears about rodriks army returning this extra then offers to find some men for him and then hes gone only to return at the start of season 3 with the men to surprise ser rodrik and now hes ramsay snow of course that means they have alfie allen there for 1 or 2 episodes of season 3 and then hes gone till season 6 or 7 they could cast an entirely different actor by that time because of all the changes that new reek goes through at ramsays hands"

"Tall Tyrion Lannister!",2012-04-30,"that would be a huge storyline change sure theyve killed people off prematurely before but theyve all been minor characters"
"Davos55",2012-04-30,"i have given up hope of seeing him this season which is very sad there is no way they can cut him out completely though he must come early next season i know i am not the only one who liked theons chapters the best in adwd and hbo surely knows that as well i like the ideas above of having an extra perhaps just really dirty and in a hood be reek and disappear at the end then he comes back and is ramsay next season though i do remember a scene from the previews that has horses circling around theon in winterfell i dont know who is doing thatperhaps asha if roose and ramsay are combinednosorry i cant even speculate because that idea is too ridiculous to me"

"Lord Varys",2012-04-30,"not sure if the tidbit from the preview roose informing robb and cat that the north has been attacked is going to mean that robb will send roose back north he would march himself not send someone in his stead if he intended to do anything at once i rather expect roose to challenge robb on this decision strongly urging him to march back home and deal with the invaders since a king without a kingdom is no king at all"
"Dornish Hen",2012-04-30,"i cant imagine the rest of the series with out theons story that being said i can imagine the rest of this season without reek imagine if robb sends bolton back to winterfell to take care of the invaders at some point bolton or someone else mentions his family life and there you have the background you need for this season bolton then takes control of winterfell taking the place of reeks character at the end of clash then in the beginning of next season we are really introduced to boltons bastard son devilgif classbbcemoticon altdevil   and the story takes off from there so just because there isnt any ramsay in this season doesnt mean there wont be one in the next with next season covering half of storm maybe theyll save a few characters for next year edited by dornish hen 30 april 2012  0537 pm"

"The Second Hand",2012-04-30,"the thinking now is that ramsay will be introduced but just barely and theon will not dissapear after season two he will instead stay on and then dissapear for one season so wed see his torture just my thinking at least very hard to cut a cast member loose for two or three seasons otherwise"
"WeirwoodTreeHugger",2012-04-30,"its interesting that we dont have info for episode ten yet we know the battle of blackwater is in ep nine so i imagine the winterfell arc will be wrapped up in ten i have no idea if ramsay could have been secretly cast and filmed without any leeks is possible but i hold out hope maybe he takes winterfell at the beginning of season three and we arent shown the bran and rickon are alive until then i cant imagine theyll go two seasons without theon especially since alfie allens performance has been so great it could be very interesting to see him defiant at first then morphing slowly into reek the kyra and the keys part could be very compelling and horrifying"
"Arkash",2012-04-30,"it is possible that ramsays been cast for ep and nothing leaked but highly improbable im still thinking he will only appear under a helmet or a hood by the end of the season and well see him next season torturing theon most obvious choice that or it is roose who takes his place which would leave a vacant place for a notherner bannerman to retake harrenhal from tywin this leads to weasel soup which is something im afraid is going to be cut"
"Morky_Pep",2012-04-30,"ramsey is out this season roose is going to go up to winterfell to take it back then betray rob without him knowing and fill ramseys part the season will end with roose burning winterfell and then bringing a captured theon back to the dreadfort and handing him over to his bastard sonor this could happen very early season 3 although the reek  ramsey thing was an awesome surprise would be too confusing for tv show i will be happy with the above events because it still sticks with the main story plots and reinforces the betrayel of roose bolton which makes his part in the rw more vile and more identifyable to a tv audience"
"Ser Hippie",2012-04-30,"i really dont see how roose going to winterfell makes sense unless they really really mess with the story him being at harrenhal for jaime is a key part of the dramatic jaime lannister sends his regards to say nothing of the importance of his presence at the red wedding itself more likely if ramsay isnt cast this season theyre merely changing how his identity and culpability for what happens at winterfell is revealed edited by ser hippie 30 april 2012  0943 pm"
"teemo",2012-04-30,"well i just wrote this in another thread but i guess ill expand on it ramsay just cant be cut there is so much commotion right now over joffreys evilness whenever i talk to someone they just cant get over him terrible evil villains  ratings because hbo can do whatever they want on tv almost they can really really go allout with ramsay and just make him one of the worst television villains out there thought joffrey was bad ha why give up that opportunity hes also important to the plottheres also the possibility that hes been kept under wraps and will be introduced this season although i find this unlikely didnt it happen with polliver however polliver is not nearly as important as ramsay though anyway at least a mention of ramsay in the next couple of episodes would make me breathe a sigh of relief if roose makes some kind of comment that he has no children i just might throw up"
"Frumpus",2012-05-01,"i cant imagine that they would do that theons adwd storyline is a fan favorite the torture and redemption that he goes through is also right up hbos dramatic alley im sure they would find ways to spread out his story enough to last through the other seasonsi agree completely but lets be honest here theons storyline has almost very little relevance to the major character storylines and the overall plot so as awesome of a story as it was its certainly become one of the most expendable no ramsay no jeyne poole roose boltons role has changed we dont even know how theon attacking winterfell will play out this season there are too many factors pointing to that story being cut"
"The Second Hand",2012-05-01,"i think so much of this rearranging dan and david have done is really needless and rarely improves upon martin dramatically cutting theons demise is simply well an awful decision creatively"
"Tyrionthebest",2012-05-01,"i agree completely but lets be honest here theons storyline has almost very little relevance to the major character storylines and the overall plot so as awesome of a story as it was its certainly become one of the most expendable no ramsay no jeyne poole roose boltons role has changed we dont even know how theon attacking winterfell will play out this season there are too many factors pointing to that story being cutyes because danys useless storyline where she stays on mereen for nine chapters is more important  ok whatever you say dude "
"victim",2012-05-01,"im not sold on ramsayreek being completely cut out we know he wont be appearing directly but i can see him being mentioned to the point where nonreaders will know who and what he is without ever seeing him like stannis in season 1 whether robb asks roose to retake winterfell or not remains to be seen im unsure what evidence there is on this i can however see a change coming where robb asks him to do this and perhaps roose declares that harrenhal is more important leaving winterfell to be retaken by his bastard son who is again only mentioned later on we would see theon being overwhelmed and winterfell being sacked by an unnamed bolton force which the audience can only assume is being led by the bastard of bolton even nonreaders should find this compelling and it also doesnt immediately out roose as a villain and stays true to the books in that way at least so what this would mean is the only part of the twist that disappears is the question of who reek is but its my opinion that theons decision about the millers boys is so much more hardhitting when it is his own im also imagining tonnes of theon torture sequences that could be spread about through season 3 and 4 such as his attempted escape with that girl it would be very fitting if his torture was slow brooding perhaps only a few scenes each season so we could see his slow decline into becoming the reek he is by book 5 so perhaps ramsay is introduced as early as season 3 yeah im not all that worried i guess"

"congokong",2012-05-02,"its pretty incomparable brans storyline went nowhere until it intertwined with theons in the books too your mileage may vary but it bored me a little at least and ramsay was integral to the climax of that it set the boltons up as a ticking time bomb in a shocker ending that no one saw coming great writing and it only improved from there when we caught up with theo reek a while lateri just cant fathom how the guys whose stated goal is to make as faithful adaption as we can of a song of ice and fire can alter theons downfall so drastically ramsay is like the bloody main antagonist of book five he has an axe to grind with everyone and what he did to winterfell in the backdrop of all that is just ugh such delicious intriguemight work might not its one hell of a liberty to take though fundamentally changing a storyline as utterly massive as the heartwrenching sack of winterfell courtesy of the evil bastard of the north might prove unwise in the futurewhen did the writers say they were trying to make as faithful an adaption as possible when they were writing the first season i ask because the second season has drastically shifted from the books many of the scenes dont even occur in the books this was not the case in the first season at this point i think theyre trying to make it their own and its not just the big things like lack of reedsramsayedmure etc added scenes like shae not knowing how to chores or different dialogue but little things like dagmer suggesting the winterfell plan to theon instead of vice versa in the books why would they have killed silver in the show if they want to stay true it did nothing for the story but take up screen time this season there have been endless examples of changes that cant be explained by budget if they want to keep it faithful no i see the show gradually being very different from the books"
"Sphinx The Riddle",2012-05-02,"reeds will be in next season i bet and your crazy if you think ramsey wont be in the show be patient"
"The Bastard of Bolton",2012-05-02,"fuck patience he might become more prominent later on in the story but the dynamic between theonreek is integral to the role reversal that comes after im really not much of a purist and can accept some of the changes but this really shits on the impact of ramsay as a character"
"Strider",2012-05-05,"i suspect we need to prepare ourselves ramsay will not be in the series his role will be fulfilled in and by roose after all how many socioopaths can a tv series adequately present is ramsey absolutely necessary to the narrative yes i know he is different from his father but if push comes to shove why cant roose be the one who makes theon into reek yes narrative changes will have to be made but will these changes violate the heart of the story"
"I'll pay the iron price",2012-05-05,"ramsey bolton must be included i hate the guy but hes a terrific villian and gives new meaning to the phrase im gonna get medievil on your ass"

"Helyn Snow",2012-05-06,"as i mentioned in another post we need ramsey to fill the psycho role so that the audience are still shocked when they find out roose was involved in planning the red wedding if roose takes on the ramsey role it wouldnt be such a surprise also talking of the red wedding it is important for roose to marry into the freys  having him marry fake arya instead whoever they are going to get instead of jeyne is not just a vile thought but roose has to be literally in bed with the freys"

"Thunderfist",2012-04-30,"i think sheâs about 191 cm 63 add some muscles some extra padding perhaps some plate armor and you have one really big actress"
"Envie",2012-04-30,"yes shes massive and so far weve seen her next to smaller actors like catelyn and even renly who isnt a big guy  so she looks even larger plus with her armor shes quite intimidating looking"
"Raylan Stark",2012-04-30,"i remember some of us worried that she was too thin and pretty when her name first started circulating as a possibility for brienne yes she was tall very tall but she was lean what she went through to prepare for the role is amazing and she has nailed it brienne tonight was astonishing her cry of anguish at renlys death gave me chills her awkward formality with cat made me smile edited by raylan stark 30 april 2012  0426 am"
"Hour of the Wolf",2012-04-30,"i really didnt like her reaction to renlys death it didnt feel genuine at all then when she gives her service to catelyn it didnt seem believable with her hatred towards stannis i dont think she has briennes personality right at all the fight scene in the tent was impressive though"
"Greywolf2375",2012-04-30,"i think she is doing a great job  it isnt just about her size watching her walk in the first episode we see her near catelyn  she doesnt even come close to walking like a lady i think she nailed the scene in the tent  my take is that she has never been able to deal with emotions well and this is the first time she has really been able to show them unfortunately for her it happens to be to a dead man she loved i like that she is ungainly not only in how she moves outside of fighting but also how she deals with others especially catelyn"
"WinterWarrior",2012-04-30,"gwendolyn christie is doing an excellent job with the brienne character she has totally nailed it and brienne is exactly how i pictured her when i read the books her anguish when renley was killed really had an impact on me and i just love this character her honor naivete and tendency to be stubborn and fiercely loyal is coming through 100 in the way christie plays brienne probably one of the best casting jobs in the whole series i cant wait to see more and more of her throughout the years edited by winterwarrior 30 april 2012  0739 am"

"Ferrum Aeternum",2012-04-30,"in interviews she said she has spent months doing weight training for the role to make her physical appearance more briennelike its apparent not only from that but especially from her performance that she has dedicated herself 100 to bringing brienne to life on screen color me quite impressed by the fight sequence in particular that couldnt have been easy for her to pull off edited by ferrum aeternum 30 april 2012  0751 am"
"whiteraven77",2012-04-30,"brienne is one of my favorite characters from the book and i have to admit that i didnt really like her at first on the show however once i watched her first episode again i started to warm up to her and last night i thought she was perfect i had chills when she pledged fealty to catelyn"
"DrogonEatsYou",2012-04-30,"imo gwendolyn christie playing brienne has been brilliant so far when reading the books i pictured her this way just this massive figure that could stand against any man that came her way i especially like her battle scenes like in the tent where she took out those two gaurds driving the sword in the back of the neck from behind eww that made me cringe but just reemphasized more for me what a badss she is edited by drogoneatsyou 30 april 2012  1059 am"
"Ser Giant",2012-04-30,"i love the character of brienne my favorite adult female in the entire story everything the actor has done with the character so far has my complete approval really glad we were able to get someone so dedicated that fight scene was absolutely brutal and perfect"
"Katydid",2012-04-30,"if those few brief seconds of her kicking all levels of ass in renlys tent are any indication of what gwen learned in terms of how brienne will handle a sword then bris fight with jaime at the creekside should be epic"
"teemo",2012-04-30,"shes a great actress i love how seriously she took this role she is also really awkward like she never feels quite comfortable in her skin and thats so brienne shes nailed it"
"Husband to Bears",2012-04-30,"brienne is wonderfully cast and i am really glad that nikolaj is also listed at 62 was having renlys guard wear actual rainbow cloaks too blatant after seeing renly and loras sex scenes the cloaks were always a nice hint into renleys sexuality but probably a little to corny to see in the series edited by husband to bears 30 april 2012  1201 pm"

"Fredwin",2012-04-30,"i dont think brienne could possibly be portrayed better than this shes been absolutely perfect so far i think the people that felt the acting was off are just being distracted by the breakneck pace of the show her cry of anguish seemed pretty emotionally intense to me not sure how you could ask for more"

"LifeRuiner",2012-05-01,"i think that gwendolyn christies brienne has a fantastic presence both physical and actingwise im barely aware of anyone else in a scene whenever shes on the screen"
"Katydid",2012-05-01,"she overacted on renlys death crying her eyes out than turning her emotions on a dime to escape not gonna sugar coat it her acting was pretty bad that scenei actually thought she nailed it pretty perfectly given what is described in the book when renly is cut she screams no as shes holding him when he collapses she throws her head back and howls in wordless anguish and she immediately jumps into combat mode until catelyn knocks one of them out and they make a fast escape the scene was acted and directed spoton imo"
"boojam",2012-05-01,"i figured they would be able to fix up the physical stuff i was worried gwendolyn christie could not carry the character drama she has really nailed that part of it a warrior woman with an inner wall  a little awkward and self conscious  tho somewhat guileless she also shows her cleverness later on its a tough role can hardly believe how good this cast is edited by boojam 01 may 2012  1225 pm"

"cromagnificent",2012-05-06,"i concur with anvilbreaker we have been given the impression that shes already a stone cold killer but this takes away from briennes humble and insecure naturewhich is her defining characteristic weve been primed in her backstory that shes amazing in the practice yard but killing for real is something she knows nothing about altering this trait changes her character completelyit annoyed me that they had her kill the guards in renlys tent later on in the book they make it clear when her first kills are"
"Jory",2012-05-06,"honestly at this point why is anyone surprised that briennes character is getting changed it would be better to ask which characters they havent changed it feels like fanfiction at this point"

"Cardinal Sin",2012-05-01,"i did not at all find it surprising that the actual admiral in the books some lord noros naryssomething along those lines if i reacall it correctly was cut from the series and that davos was given the comment still it leads to an important incoherence davos in the book severely criticised the admirals hasty push towards kl which was responsible for the massacre that awaited them there i wonder if in the series they make davos stick to the same strategy as the admiral in the books possibly because he was commanded to hurry up by an impatient stannis or whether they change his strategy so that he eg sends ahead ships to probe the bay very likely the first which might make tvdavos nowhere near as good a seaman as he is in the books"
"Maltaran",2012-05-01,"yep i was surprised at this a good part of the first davos chapter at the blackwater is him mentally criticising imry florent for being too impatient i guess well just have to wait and see how they handle it we havent heard anything from tyrions end about the chain yet"
"Bayard",2012-05-01,"yeah they are compromising both men davos and stannis by this decision i was even more shocked about the ships i mean just look stannis are a lot smaller then the ironborn longship why"

"BinkyBonks",2012-05-01,"i dont like it theyre making davos look completely worthless whereas in the books he constantly provides stannis with useful advice also wtf was that business about rowing out to storms end in the dead of the night when rely wasnt at storms end"
"Jamie Lannister",2012-05-01,"well all we know is that its a naval assault on kings landing they could and probably will change the logistics and events of the battle from the book considerably"
"bloodymime",2012-05-01,"maybe theyre cutting out the naval battle almost completely by davos sending in a few ships to probe and their getting lit up by wildfire theres no mention of tyrions chain being built as it is yeah what kingslayer said theres probably as much chance of their doing a fullscale naval battle like in the books as there has been of seeing any significant mounted combat edited by bloodymime 01 may 2012  0229 pm"
"Davos55",2012-05-01,"as far as i know imry florent has been cast so he will probably end up rallying the ships and disobeying davos orders davos tried to warn stannis that he will not be taken seriously by high born naval commanders and i am sure that will come into play i dont think the series will have davos make such careless mistakes i hope not atleast i do find it curious that there has been no mention of a chain as that was the key to the naval demise and it was a genius tactical move by tyrion i am going to have to agree with jamie lannister here and go with the assumption that this scene will be altered but a naval battle involving wildfire and a handful of ships will occur we will have to wait and see edited by davos55 01 may 2012  0400 pm"

"Ser Pink of Floyd",2012-05-01,"its suprising and isnt grrm actually involved in the writing for the episode the blackwater happens in i think the easiest way they are going to get out of this little mess is that some of those angry admirals are going to break ranks and fly in wo davos and ensure what happens in the book happens in the show thats all i can think they can do with it"
"Cardinal Sin",2012-05-01,"imry florent yes that was the name of the chap was actually cast sure all the weirder than that he was not given command of the fleet well hbo somehow has the tendency to make awesome book characters look curiously inept in the tv series littlefinger anyone not bashing the actor just the lines i kind of fear that davos will undergo the same treatment  being degraded from perhaps the best seaman in the whole of westeros to an average commander who messes things up big time hope that davos will actually draft up a great masterplan that will be screwed by florents vaingloriour headlong rush into battle  that would be interesting but i somehow fear for the worst  davos being responsible for the blackwater desaster even though we should have done better and yes  no chain but that was so important well i believe to the episode blackwater we still have 3 scenes time to make a chain during that time i suppose"
"Carne",2012-05-01,"ser imry florent has been cast and is played by gordon mahn"
"RobertOfTheHouseBaratheon",2012-05-02,"i think the chain will be introduced the same or previous episode to the battle they dont feel they need to explain the logistics and they probably think people would forget about in in episode 5 and then it will come out of nowhere in episode 9 tyrion will prob unviel it towards the end of episode 8 leaving the audience to wonder about what its for unitil the battle a week later"
"Peasant Rebel Leader",2012-05-02,"the chain can be introduced at any later time if they want do you have a source for imry florent being cast i would have thought they would use sallador somehow in the battle since itd be a waste for just one scene the do have 4 characters on the ships if i count right davos matthos seaworth sallador and thus imry florent that allows them to go in enough direction without making davos look inept"

"MadMage",2012-05-03,"i think the comment davos makes that no lords will follow me is likely foreshadowing for the exchange when davos is made stannis hand of the king paraphrasing davos but im baseborn none of the lords will follow me stannis then we will make new lords epic"
"Honey Badger",2012-05-03,"maybe theyll present it as a betrayal as it would suck if davos was shown to be incompetent at command hes a pirate who knows scouts and guile are important and would have never walked into tyrions chain or cerseis wild fire there can still be incompetence where he fails to inspire his men as no lord wants to recognize the upjumped onion knight which is consistent with the books"

"snowzombie",2012-04-30,"i like that arya is serving as tywins cupbearer because it gives us more charles dance and its interesting to see arya reacting to how he speaks of her brother but i was wondering why wouldnt she ask jaqen hgar to kill tywin hes her brothers main military foe and hes right there in harrenhal she said the tickler tonight and it seemed like she felt pressured to come up with a name and he was the first person to come to mind theres no wease or anyone like him whos making her life a living hell whos going to be a believable second wish and is freeing a bunch of northerners really going to seem more effective militarily than decapitating the lannister army unrelated tom wlaschiha as jaqen  so fine he can make talking in the 3rd person hot love him im going to be sad when he gives up that face"

"Mendoza",2012-04-30,"i get the vibe on the show that arya was just seeing if a man could pull it off or if he was full of crap so she names someone she saw do horrible things up close as a sort of test at end of the episode she knows a man is for real and it seems heavly implied that she would use a kill on tywin based on their scenes together something he does or says must change her mind"

"Lors' Edrick",2012-04-30,"from the persepctive of tywin he mentions again in this episode cersei mentions it a few times in earlier ones that they have a spy in the north is this an easier way of letting on that roose bolton has been under their banner since the beginning and as such there is no need for him to retake harrenhal for robb as roose will be just holding it for the lannisters"

"Honey Badger",2012-04-30,"seems weird that she wouldnt pick tywin roose i understand because thats technically robbs bannerman and while cold arya didnt perceive roose as a threat worth killing knocking off the most high powered lannister makes sense however but knowing they both have plot armor â<U+0099> its simply not the time for arya to kill tywin or vice versa i forget in the books why arya didnt pick juicier targets yes weese or the tickler just to prove that jaqen is real but after that id pick the two biggest targets i could think of and send the faceless man on his way so tywin and joffrey or replace one name with cersei or definitely littlefinger if arya understood his part in betraying her father ned my impression was that grrm didnt what to make hghar too much of a tom bombadil character who was too powerful for the sake of the story"

"Aegon I",2012-05-01,"i have a feeling were going to have one more added scene where tywin expresses his regret that ned stark was killed causing this war he never wanted couple this with the fact that currently robb is whopping tywins butt in the field plus the whole saving her and gendry thing would give her ample reason to spare tywin"
"Dragon greyscale",2012-05-01,"the more i think about it the more i can see a possibility of tywin getting hit people say thats inconceivable because tyrions crossbow scene is pivotal in his own character arc i guess thats true to some extent but plot wise tyrion could also be made to flee kl after the purple wedding skip the imprisonment maybe shae bangs joffrey instead the rw could be cerseis idea the only thing i am not sure of is how the war would develop without tywin as field commander but if you think about it most of the actual battles and strategies arent really given any screen time anyway im just saying there are ways to work around it but as i mentioned before it would have some serious butterfly effects if they dont off tywin my money is on aegon is suggestion theyll add a scene to make both arya and tywin seem more human ie the little girl only kills heartless punks that really deserve it and tywin is not one of those punks but he is begrudgingly performing his duties as ruler"
"redqueen",2012-05-01,"i think she wont kill tywin because he offers her limited protection killing tywin might not seem important in aryas eyes since hes a commander and there are other men that will take his place if hes gone as they say the devil you know another man promoted to tywins position could be more dangerous arya might think that tywin is losing his battles against robb and another commander might win those battles she could see that robb is safer with this man in charge than an unknown arya doesnt know enough to know if killing tywin would have a positive or negative effect on the outcome of the war her brothers safety i think it comes down to tywin is protecting her at harrenhal she wouldnt be foolish enough to kill the man that stopped the trickler from killing her and her friends she needs him alive at the moment his life is safe from aryas three wishes"

"sarah.jenice",2012-05-02,"whatever happens i think the show pretty clearly sets up tywin as one of aryas choices my nonreading girlfriend literally asked me shes going to kill him rightand it makes total sense with what weve been given as cupbearer of tywin important difference with the books arya hears all about his strategy to destroy her brother i mean the tension is already palpable in that one scene between them youd have to be very obtuse not to want to try and stop the person whos out to get youre brother if you have the chancemy 5 cents a tywin gets offed or b  he leaves in the nick of time after arya ordered his death regardless i have no doubts that shell ask for tywin as the second or third death butterfly effects galoreif they followed the books tywin leaving shouldnt matter if i remember correctly arya asks jaquen if he could kill a person that was not there and he tells her something like a man puts on foot in front of the other and in a month or a year it will be done i think this happens before the third wish but i am not one hundred percent certainin the show i am leaning toward her choosing polliver next maybe after he directly hurts her or gendry and maybe uses the last wish to escape i am not sure if it will be necessary for roose to take harrenhal now especially considering that robb will find out what is happening in the north soon so maybe arya uses the weasel soup to escape harrenhal after tywin leaves them there with the mountain or ser armory"

"LifeRuiner",2012-05-03,"there is no need to establish a long relationship sansa would probably trust the first person who promises to get her out of there  because she has not seen a friendly face for months also as these meetings had a drunk and rapey uncle vibe in the books the show runners probably wouldnt want ser dontos to slobber over and grope the underage actress on the screen either way i wouldnt count on this part of the books being shot true to canon edited by liferuiner 03 may 2012  0347 pm"

"Peasant Rebel Leader",2012-05-03,"why would they introduce him in the premiere and then forget about him thats not how television works if they show you a detail and linger on it like dontos drunk stumbling it will have an effect later on plus its an easy way to at least end one story line on a high note"
"Carl Drogo",2012-05-02,"from reading the books i had always imagined the iron fleet to be made up of vikingstyle opendecked longboats i was quite surprised to see the sea bitch depicted as a regular galley of sorts i looked it up on awoiaf they have no description of the boats of the ironmen but show this image this would obviously support the longboat theory of course longboats make the most sense for raiders because they can be beached now did i just imagine this incorrectly or were the ships actually described as longboats and they just changed it for the film if so why did they change it i imagine the ship was cgi so they could just as well have done a longboat for any real scenes a longboat would also have been much easier to construct i dont get it"

"sarah.jenice",2012-04-30,"i understand why they made the decision because for the tv only viewers aryas kill needed to be someone they recognized and wanted dead however i am kind of let down that they dont have her kill the tickler like she does at the inn that was a really bloody gruesome death she dealt and i think it was an important turning point for her she hasnt killed much yet but i am certain they are going to stick to her journey of being a lethal killing machine like in the books arya is one of my favorite book and show characters i loved the scene with her and jaqen but i did expect him to call her arya i cant wait to see how her story unfolds on the show"

"Laohu",2012-04-30,"one negative effect to abbreviating aryas storyline which i am in support of by the way is that there are not as many antagonists currently at harrenhal who she would conceivably choose to be targeted by jaqen granted there were not too many in the books either as i recall and she even regretted at least one of those decisions after the fact as with many things we have witnessed as the show continues the butterfly effect is going to wreck havoc to the story as book readers know it"

"SerArthurHeath",2012-04-26,"the key point is that jaimes attempted escape wont happen as tyrion hasnt planned it so we wont see jaime in action before spoiler he loses his hand it kind of detracts from the strength of change that it induces in him as he is going to be seen to lose to an old man get captured by a boy scared shitless by a long legged wolf humiliated by everyone then beaten up by a woman not actually demonstrating any competency with his sword at any point before spoiler losing his hand  itd still suck but it isnt the utter loss if purpose and identity that it is in the books and thats without accounting for the lack of first person insight the show will get its not intelligent story telling plus if it does happen at the end of the season who is going to do it bolton brienne i know hes going to get released this season but doing it as early as 7 is a waste especially as it removes the chance of putting in canon scenes that would provide nikolai with a great scene the audience with some action and all for not too much money or time whilst adding to jaime and robbs character and setting up robbs time with jeyne and the karstark storyline"
"SerArthurHeath",2012-04-26,"the actor listing is relevant because the presence of cat brienne jaime and no robb in episode 7 heavily implies that the major thing thing involving jaime will be his release and not his escape in which case as he is not shown before then this will not occur its not a very hard inference to make edited by serarthurheath 26 april 2012  0655 pm"

"SerArthurHeath",2012-04-27,"i agree for me the most riveting aspect of jaimes change is that we get an insight into who jaime used to be before he decided that there was no good in this world and no point in being good as it gets you as otracised as being evil that all he has is his skill with a sword and thats all he can rely on believe in but its so good that it is all he needs we see all of that taken away he isnt just someone good with a sword it is his entire identity a persona he has created himself and utterly become and when he loses it he starts to head back to what he wanted to be before he decided it couldnt exist or survive that is going to be very hard to show on screen if we never learn what jaime wanted to be and the feelings that drove him to selfloathing instead on another note if thats their attempt to make jaime a swordsman before he loses it all it sucks show dont tell especially on a visual medium with no privileged access to private thoughts and where it is very easy to forget words but images will last a lot longer he killed jory quickly but as hes basically a mook its pretty irrelevant he loses to ned in the eyes of the unsullied they all were sure he was going to lose and thats why the guard intervened he gets captured and they mention in passing that he killed 10 men so what missed opportunity to demonstrate what happened in the books where jaime makes robbs tactical superiority nearly redundant by almost cutting down robb robb with nothing to lose refuses to duel him of course robb would lose hes a teenager in his first battle this kingsguard are specifically nonskilled lannister cronies now he is going to be seen without the insight into how both characters are feeling and without the emphasis on jaime fighting bound and after months seems like days at most in the season of capture that in the book left him underweight clearly hasnt been malnutrition in the series to lose to a woman in his next fight i know we only got to hear about jaime though in less uncertain terms in the book but its a different medium one where you can tell people things rather than one where the emphasis should be on showing we also have to have points hammered home weve had 23 added scenes just to emphasis that joffrey is unpleasant and lf is a slimy douche so cutting out canon if unseen scenes that establish jaimes most important character aspect at this point is really stupid its just if jaime lost his ability to fight at this point i would thinkthats annoying but youre alive and the eldest son of the richest and most powerful house in westeros not you have to change every single thing you have thought about yourself for the past 15 years because of the choices you made"

"NewJeffCT",2012-04-29,"i imagine this episode will begin with the aftermath of the pregnancymy guess is the episode will start with cat visiting renly in his castle or tent with brienne there cant imagine davos would need to row beneath the bowels of the tents theyll have their chat and then shadow baby strikes causing cat  brienne to flee theyll then flash to davos  mel rowing out from where ever they were"
"Jory",2012-04-29,"1it will make it all the better if it looks like rob and renly will allywhy  i dont get the desire to change things that dont need to be changed renly wasnt a very sympathetic character no please dont make him one for no reason hbo"
"Mark Antony",2012-04-29,"why  i dont get the desire to change things that dont need to be changed renly wasnt a very sympathetic character no please dont make him one for no reason hboagree and that will make viewers hate stannis not that they probably already dont i feel like im in the minority in being someone whos enjoyed this stannis character edited by wutangwesteros 29 april 2012  0303 pm"
"imladolen",2012-04-29,"the tickler wasnt that memorable here so if they do her inn scene later nonfans will probably forgot who he wasthat sort of thing is easily fixed with those previously on game of thrones sequences they put at the beginning of each episode the people who only torrent the show to watch it might miss out on that assuming the torrentable versions dont include that part but do we really care about them"
"CrypticWeirwood",2012-04-29,"1it will make it all the better if it looks like rob and renly will allywhich will just further bludgeon us with martinâ<U+0080><U+0099>s superannoying idealism that good guys always lose and nice guys always finish last leave the stupid politics out of it itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s tedious preachy and unrealistic itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s also pretty fucking depressing"
"SerArthurHeath",2012-04-29,"is that the idealism assuming and it is an assumption that at the end the good guys end up surviving isnt the idealism that really bad stuff will happen to good people at really bad times but that doesnt mean that evil will win in the end isnt that a reasonably realistic point of view i dont even think martin is that cynical if we take the likes of jordan whom nobody would claim to write that kind of cynicism both authors are willing to put their characters through similar emotional and physical trauma its just that grrm kills some of his major ones the underlying implication is that it willall end up ok in the end for both"
"teemo",2012-04-29,"first scene  renly instadeath"
"Arkash",2012-04-29,"i truly hope of course well have a little discussion between cat and renly before the death but what i really want to see is loras fury and bloodthirst "
"Chelly",2012-04-29,"im wondering if renly will die immediately too i mean whats the shadow baby been doing the whole time if renly is not killed immediately playing solitaire in the cave im still not convinced show loras is this skilled swordsman so i would also like to see him rage and cut down some fellow knights that would be a very cool added scene that we never got to see in the book"
"DragonAge93",2012-04-29,"i dont think renlys death will be in a castle but in his command tent as we see in the preview brienne is fighting in his tent so why did davos go in the cave well find out in a few hours i guess"

"J_Crews",2012-04-29,"the only really confusing thing for me is going to be why would arya not ask jaqen to kill tywin in the book she later regretted not choosing him but there was nothing weird about it since he was not right in her face as it is going to be in the showâ<U+0080>i donâ<U+0080><U+0099>t know what hbo will do about thatâ<U+0080>i think itll be because though hes an enemy he wont be needlessly cruel in her presence tywin is ruthless but very intelligent and rarely cruel except with respect to tyrions emotions and other isolated incidents even with something as heinous as the kiling of rhaegars children which he believed was necessary in order to prove house lannisters loyalty to robert he was aghast at how barbarically it was carriedoutit wont be until later that shell realize what a chance she missed to strike a blow in the war edited by js crews 29 april 2012  0504 pm"
"Strider",2012-04-29,"why  i dont get the desire to change things that dont need to be changed renly wasnt a very sympathetic character no please dont make him one for no reason hbobecause it makes for a better story conformity to the book is not the be all and end all in the book it really doesnt matter whether renly was northfriendly or not but in the series it makes a more compelling story if he expresses his willingness to ally with rob and then gets murdered"
"Dracarya",2012-04-29,"so excited for brienne to go all nuts in this episode shes gonna kick some arse as for arya not picking tywin i think it will still happen in a similar way to the book  like shell see someone not sure if theyll stick to the same characters as the book doing something bad and instantly pick them because its at the forefront of her mind shes still a child after all edited by dracarya 29 april 2012  0545 pm"
"bloocanary",2012-04-29,"jaqen can very well be a follower of the lord of light or any other god however jaqen is not a faceless man jaqen is the persona that a faceless man wears when that faceless man whatever his name is if he even remembers it removes the persona of jaqen then yes we would expect him to follow the religious orthodoxy of the fm we should not expect that of the character he is wearing at any one time one could argue that hed be a bad fm if his characteristics carried over in facti disagree that this is part of his disguise because he refers to him as the red god if he were a worshipper of rhllor i think he would refer to him as rhllor or the lord of light i could be wrong but im pretty sure only people outside the religion refer to him as the red god and his worshippers the red priestsim of the opinion personally that jaqen is not a disguise because of how upset he gets when arya names him as her third death if jaqen hghar was just an assumed name he could easily have changed his face right then said there jaqen hghar is dead our debt is fulfilled and then taken off to the citadel"
"Crown",2012-04-29,"i wish i lived in america going to sleep now and wake up tomorrow and watch the episode then cant wait to see brienne got nuts"
"imbs",2012-04-29,"you guys do realise that arya isnt aware that jaqen is a master facechanging assassin yet right from aryas pov a random mysterious stranger who has already been caught once has offered to kill 3 people for her consider all the guards and security tywin lannister will have compared to the other lesser men it would be really easy to have arya not pick him and portray it as a decent decision better cheswyck sp and co than no one edited by imbs 29 april 2012  0759 pm"
