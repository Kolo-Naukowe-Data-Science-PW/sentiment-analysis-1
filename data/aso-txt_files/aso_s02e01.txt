"Mista C",2012-04-04,"during the scene when joff is renovating the throne room they clearly show the stainedglass window above the iron thone as being a sevenpointed orange and red star with clear glass all around it i was rewatching some season 1 episodes yesterday and noticed that the stainedglass window above the iron throne was a very colorful design which i couldnt really make out but there was definately no star and it was way different a good place to see it is in episode 5 when littlefinger and varys have their discussion in the empty throne room i know that joff tells the queen that he wants the room to look more like it belongs to a conqueror and not have vines and flowers but would he really have changed out the windows as well i know that this is a ridiculous issue to even bring up but it jumped right out at me becuase i had just rewatched s02ep1 and then watched s01ep5 right after so i was like whats up with the window above the iron throne its different anyone else notice this"

"gramblor",2012-04-04,"i think they did a phenomenal jobs with the direwolves i saw the grey wind scene and the ghost scene from episode 2 although you can tell that they arent actually there they did an incredible job and i couldnt have hoped for anything better"

"GreenAppleFossoway",2012-04-04,"does anyone else think that they are building up ros to take the place of chataya also i noticed they cut out tyrion moving shae to a random brothel as soon as he gets to kl i hope they are able to fully portray tyrions cunning and super sneakyness wtf was with that whole crasterjon stuff all that happened in the book was craster saying this one has the look of a stark guess they need to give you a reason to hate craster besides the whole molesting all of his childrendoing something shady with the male children i think if they had made craster as weird looking as i do from the book plus having those lines people would just say wtf jeor why would you take this guys advice the way they showed him he just looked like a really crappy lord or even a ser definatly not one of the freepeople"

"Milk Steak",2012-04-04,"i thought craster looked so healthy was a good choice for television hes in a dire place where every other wildling has fled the conditions are so harsh that even the nights watch looks haggard here in the middle of all this misery is craster fat and happy how is he doing so well why hasnt he fled from the same dangers its not exactly a fortress and he seems unconcerned by attacks supernatural or not to first time viewers all this would give a distinct impression that something is very off here things just dont add up and that is what the show wants if your purpose is to give a sense to tv viewers that craster has pulled a faust than the choice is a smart one"

"Dr. Pepper",2012-04-01,"i gave it a 7 excellent acting jack gleeson was brilliant pretty decent prop and background its difficult to see how some of the changes theyve made are going to tie in with the main plots in the books i was disappointed that it didnt start with the maester and melisandre poison wine scene but i think what they did help set up how mysterious and strange melisandre is i was pretty annoyed with the whole ros scene yes yes we know there are whorehouses and we know whores get trained maybe it was to show that if a whore can be trained to be believable in her pleasure perhaps a whore can also be trained by ros to be believable as a replacement for a certain missing child"
"Hasfast",2012-04-01,"i gave it an 8 i have my reservations about melisandre like someone said in a previous post the actress seems plain i really do hope it gets better or it will ruin all the importance that character gets i hoped it would start at dragonstone as well like the first season started beyond the wall i wanted to see patchface i somehow doubt hell appear at any pointcraster was a disappointment and the whorehouse was absurd i would have wanted the small council scene to be as long as it is in the novel too particularly with the three slaps hahahaha i loved that partthe general feel is great i really liked they presented all the different settings with a shot of the red comet and i loved grey wind dr"
"MA5Bergey",2012-04-01,"i thought the whole of crasters keep was poorly done not how i pictured it in my head and i didnt like craster that much i also felt like the interaction between the lc and jon snow as well as the interaction between jon snow and craster felt forced the way it was presented in the show i feel like cersei in show is starting to match her book counterpart in terms of ihateherness i missed ros boobs sorry im a guy but the gold watchs murder spree made me rage cant wait to see the lannisters get theirs all in all i feel like they had a lot to accomplish in the first episode since television is such a different medium than a novel but they did it well"

"The Bastard of Bolton",2012-04-02,"it got a 7 from me as well might have gotten more if i hadnt watched the last 4 episodes of last season before jumping into this intro i loved tyrions scenes cersei looks lovier than before the locations are beautiful the cgi is amazing the acting was spot on changing the joust to the melee was a mistake when you establish the scene as involving fights to the death it seems out of place for sansa to step in a save some random fool it just didnt make as much sense as it did in the books i didnt really like the changes to cressens ending i understand he took the first sip to get her to feel it is safe but when a poison is that fast acting it really seems like a moot move it was so much better in the book when she gave him the opportunity to spill it took the first sip and invited him to his horror to take the last swallow the littlefinger thing didnt bother me as much as i thought it would obviously the rumours of the incest were common knowledge at this point if even joffrey heard of it it is no longer a trump card no longer a very well kept secret in my interpretation this was just lf being a smartass and checking how much he can toy with the queen cersei knows that the cat has been let out of the hat at this point elsewise she would have had him killed crasters keep felt a bit off for me as well yet i still enjoyed it visually and had i not read the books i still would have known there was something very wrong about the place the biggest problem is that it felt a bit rushed and not fleshed out enough cersei slapping joffrey made sense given the situation and i felt it played well into showing how sinister and power mad joffrey is becoming when he would threaten the life of his own mother honestly though where the fuck is my greatjon if he isnt going to be present this season at least make mention that he is fighting important battles on some other front or something i just spent a few episodes seeing him constantly as a sort of right hand man to robb the very man who called him king in the north first and now im supposed to shrug off his complete absence ros being the main madame at the brothel is a bit sudden happy that i had infanticide to take my mind off that one i know im sounding more negative than someone who gave it an honest 7 it is just easier to voice criticism than it is to praise"

"Harle The Handsome",2012-04-02,"i gave it a 9 we only saw a little of crasters keep but the outside looks awesome some people are upset about it jumping around too much but i expected it my two complaints are why the creators added two pointless scenes the littlefinger bit i get it establishes why he would work against cersie but i hated the ros scene it was just pointless and the ros character adds nothing to the series there are already a shitload of cahracters i dont see the need to add another one other than that i loved it and it has me pumped for the rest of the seasoni took the opposite viewpoint regarding that scene i understand cersis pov  where power is power and there is nothing like it in the world and you can stick your knowledge up your ass and scurry away you little rat but i dont get it from littlefingers perspective he is much too clever to let something like that slip from his tongue around cersi to whom no slight is too small to cruelly repay"
"SFA-OK",2012-04-02,"ill give it a 5 not a fan of any of the new casts so far except for maybe davos too early to tell maybe im hoping the actress they cast for brienne does a good job i think maybe the two guys writingadapting the books just arent very good writers pretty cliched stuff imo"
"EgoistMusketeer",2012-04-02,"i have mixed feelings about this episode first off the beginning had that idiotic vibe that hbo creates in season premiers for shows like entourage its that weird vibe that sort of like all the characters were on summer vacation and now theyre back and telling their friends how theyve been luckily it only lasted the first few minutes i also hated the ros scene when she talked to the new whores in the same way that littlefinger had talked to her when she first arrived did anyone at hbo think that was clever clash is more spread out than thrones so in order to update the viewer on every character we got maybe five minutes of screen time for dany jon tyrion but a decent helping of cersei it seems like they are already trying to make cersei sympathetic by making the bastard purge joffreys plan its expected from a premier especially one that has a year between 10 episodes to have a slower pace i actually loved the snippets we got on dragon stone and melisandre stannis and davos are all great i didnt like the craster casting he didnt seem as haggard or wild as he could have been i did enjoy the city guard montage at the end and tyrions confrontation with cersei in the small counsel was brilliant overall there were a few things i didnt like but it was a solid opener for what is prepping to be a great season"
"Gravity Star",2012-04-02,"i think maybe the two guys writingadapting the books just arent very good writers pretty cliched stuff imoi think almost every scene that hasnt been in the books has been great and often better than the word for word book scenes the maester pyclleroz scene aside"
"footballcoach",2012-04-02,"510 it was a mess imo i have read the books several times and i was confused with all the plot and time leaps i realize its going to move faster and some areas are rewritten to fit a television series however i dont recall feeling jarred with plot differences and time leaps so much in any other episode immediately afterward i felt like i needed to watch half of it again in order to reconcile it with what was in the books overall it was just a weird disjointed episode for me poor casting for stannis and craster davos seemed pretty good craster visit was very anticlimactic and disappointing melisandre i am on the fence about still but she seemed appropriately dangerous i suppose"

"Lord Ravenfrost",2012-04-02,"overall i liked the season opener i thought they did a clever job in condensing some of the early chapters and gleeson makes joffery even more repugnant if thats even possible i gave it a seven because i think that the writers take the things implied in the books a little too far sometimes like killing roberts bastards and i dont really remember cersei threatening littlefinger directly with bodily harm i also dont remember osha knowing a damn thing about dragons either these are but small gripes the real injustice to the original material is how crasters keep played out i think the scene could have done with more of a sinister tone i hope when we see the black brothers return there will be a darker tone to things cressens scene couldve played out better too i dont like how quickly the poison took effect im really looking forward to the next nine episodes"
"Lord Florent",2012-04-02,"did anyone else love stannis i kept trying to see if hed grind his teeth and youll notice it from time to time and he moved so awkwardly it was perfect i was just rereading the book and i remember reading the scene where he grabs the sword and i remember envisioning it exactly the same way he walked it on the shot i just wish he had a deeper voice am i the only one who didnt like the littlefinger scene i liked him as a psychopath that keeps planning his elevation within the game he always expected to backstab the lannisters and was waiting for his opportunity but if they use that scene to explain his betrayal not cool varys is so great too"

"KhaleesiDany",2012-04-02,"lol mine is the only vote at 5 what do you guys even see in this show granted i dont watch much television im glad game of thrones is on tv and that it will bring more people to read the books i think they do an ok job with the casting and i understand that there are limitations in the film medium that have to be worked around to bring this story from the page to the screen but when im watching the show i feel like i am seeing some unimaginative persons impression of the books maybe unimaginiative is too harsh of a word but i feel like all the scenes are pale visions of what happened at that point in the story i feel like i am watching a rewrite with all the scenes contrived to fit together instead of just flowing along all the best parts like the battles are cut or edited out and the characters all come across as dull except tyrionhow is this possible when i read these books and feel like i am alive alongside them in the books i dont even like tyrion this episode in particular was kind of slow pacedreally bad mistake for a premiere imo they move things around all the time they could have put some exciting stuff in here none of the characters looks like how i imagine them but i forgive it every time if the actor is even the littlest bit good but jon snow is the worst not only does he not remind me of booksnow at all the actor who plays him just stands around gaping all day at nothing and where was gilly if they introduced her it flew over my head jaime lannister looked like he was sleeping when grey wind came up to attack himi laughed and why put fakeouts like that in the show in the first place they could make grey wind actually intimidating by showing him ripping out peoples throats in a battlebut they never seem to show any battle scenes cersei talking to littlefinger was a good scene until she told her soliders to close their eyesand they all turned to follow her when she left i guess they have eyes in the back of their heads and xray vision so they can see through their helmets that mistake could have been fixed by one line guards i thought melisandre was okay until she opened her mouth i just cant take this show seriously and it does not give me anywhere near the rush i get from reading to all yall who watch the show and havent read the books do yourself a favor and read them i dont care if the only time you read is when you take a shit in the morning and it takes you a year you will not regret it because this show is like a window to someone elses window of westeros and you will not regret it if you just take a peek outside your own head"

"snowzombie",2012-04-02,"this was maybe my favorite episode thus far i felt like almost all of the changes for the sake of narrative economy ended up making the show better tighter more exciting the nonbook scenes  cersei and littlefinger cersei and joffrey the city watch and the bastards  were thrilling the look on lenas face when joffrey pretty much tells her hell have her killed if she defies him it really makes you feel how high the stakes are sansa cersei and tyrion all have to walk a very fine line when it comes to reigning him in without provoking his wrath tyrion comes into kings landing with the swagger of a conqueror its going to be even more bitter and disappointing to see how he leaves id imagined craester looking like king theoden in lord of the rings before gandalf kills the spell wormtongue had cast gray frazzled a droopy ear crazy but the set of his keep definitely grew on me as the scene went on richard madden was the stand out his robb is really really strong he really conveys the weight of all that he has to contend with i find his character far more compelling on screen than i do in the books"

"Prince of Dragonstone",2012-04-02,"solid 8 rating 1 how could they have extended cressens scene why make the audience emotionally invest in someone who was going to die in 5 minutes there was only so much time to devote to that i loved the acok prologue but there was no way to translate that whole chapter to television and keep all the book fans happy i expected it to be cut short 2 as i said in the other thread the cersei vs littlefinger scene was amazing in my opinion it wasnt so much about littlefinger as it was foreshadowing cerseis personality political style and how she perceives the world she has this first taste of real powerno more robert in her way and what does she do wield it like a blunt object totally how cersei from the books would handle it shes uses power like a sledge hammer often to her own detriment for those who think this was out of character for littlefinger it makes sense that his hot button would be catelyn his childhood trauma with her is at the very core of who hes become as a man i found it very deft of cersei to zero in on that great scene all around nice touch of having the lannister guards act like mindless henchmen as well 3 too early to tell about the dragonstone crew stannis melisandre and davos but i think overall those scenes were enjoyable and i did get really excited when i saw the camera pan over castle dragonstone 4 the scene between tyrion and cersei was the best part of the episode imo dinklage is gunning for another emmy he just makes it look so damn easy 5 the only disappointment for me was crasters keep like other said it could have been a lot more foreboding and i think the casting of craster is wrong but not bad enough to make the storyline fail hes not that big of a character in the long run 6 the bastard slaying scene was brutal cruel and epic really sets the audience up to despise janos slynt the whole scene had a very biblical king herrod infanticide decree feel to it i really just hope they they explain that it was cersei not joffrey who gave the command 7 dany got such a short scene but then again she doesnt have much to do in acok till she gets to the house of the undying 8 you can obviously see that the production team has a lot more money to play around with this season watching the sweeping panorama views of the landscapes on my hd screen was great the sweep from the red waste to beyond the wall was particularly good kings landing is much better also 9 lena headey really stepped up her game this time around she is really coming into the role of cersei lannister and playing her as the dangerous power mad shedevil that she is 10 overall i very much enjoyed the episode and thought that it set things up nicely i also like that there seems to be a darker feel to this season if that makes sense i felt that the book series got darker after agot as well so its nice that the show creators picked up on that much more ominous and creepy this season"
"Peter1982",2012-04-02,"they did a great job you have to introduce so many stuff follow on on so many questions the babykilling was horrific in the books you read that it has taken place but here you see how cruel this world is and i had to think of the 8000 unsullied and it left you wondering what will happen with arya i like it that they want to make the events from sos even more dramatic by developing a strong robb story line instead of a strong catelyn line i really liked the joffreyparts and generally yes the lord of light stof comes over a bit goofy instead of scarry melisandra looks to innocent all feel they should have gone for someone nasty although i must say that the melisandra character in the book has some soft sides as well i mean she is not the evil queen she is a misguided priestess thats all the series make her look who she is just a priestess like thoros and those other red people"

"A Time for Wolves",2012-04-02,"pretty solid i especially liked all the lannister parts i agree with those who said that emphasis on ros at the expense of some truly wonderful opportunities with crasters keep was unfortunate there was no suspense or any real exploration of the creepiness surrounding crasters keep not a fan of how they depicted craster either  weird castingcostuming they barely hinted at the mystery of crasters sons and we should have seen the deserted villages i also think they should have stepped up brans greenseer storyline a complaint i also had in season 1 but thats pretty much what benioff and weiss have been doing since season 1 emphasis on the sensationalist sex at the expense of scenes that could helped us get in the characters heads even further or scenes that bring out the creepy fantastical genuinely weird supernatural element of this seriessorry i know i keep harping on this and there wasnt even much sex in this episode im not against nudity or sex on tv at all but it has been pretty offputting to see this rich story trashified for ratings at the expense of the storyline i keep saying it but 10 hours is not nearly enough time for us to get into the characters skins in the way the books do and i want the tv show to create time for us to just explore the characters not just squeeze in the exposition complex plot and fleeting character development and then devote 5 precious minutes out of a 55 minute time slot for a naked prostituteorgywhateveri have heard people dismiss got as trash because of the excessive nudity and while thats obviously not a fair assessment it does indicate how pointless those scenes are im not one of the people who finds the sexposition even remotely necessary sometimes not even in the books for that matter there are plenty of more effective ways to relay that information and in fact i think this episode proved it everything was deftly explained to the viewers without relying on monologues unnatural conversations or moaning whores"

"Thunderfist",2012-04-02,"i was actually really disappointed about this episode so many changes that made no sense and things that had been added or removed it seems outofcharacter for littlefinger to try to intimidate cersei he never does anything like that in the books heâs just a background player i didnât see the point of having the hound fight anyone the scene with roberts bastards made it seem like he had fathered half the children in kings landing dany flirting with her bloodrider didnât make alot of sense but my biggest problem was that they did not include the dialogue between tyrion and cersei when he arrives for the meeting of the small council that is one of my favourites in the entire series and i really wanted to see what peter dinklage could do with it on screen i never understood what jaime saw in you apart from his own reflection  too epic to leave out i gave the episode a 3 i worry that as the books expand the series is still limited to 10 episodes and thus it might feel forced and stunted edited by thunderfist 02 april 2012  0421 am"

"Orangutangu",2012-04-02,"i rated it a 5 as i was really quite disappointed with this episode more than anything i thought it was a weak opening of a new seasoni suspect that i might think slightly better of it after a rewatch as it took quite a few episodes to get me into season 1 but when i did i really loved it even the early episodes that i didnt really warm to to begin withnevertheless here are my initial thoughts in no particular order1 i hated the sex hated it i thought the whole whore houseros scene was pretty clumsily done but the sex really bothered me i actually didnt have a problem with it in season 1 unlike many people i know sure some of it wasnt strictly necessary to tell the story they wanted to tell but the books are unashamed in their descriptions of sex and so i think it is appropriate that the tv series is too for some reason it really didnt work for me in this episode though i find it hard to put my finger on exactly what it was but something made it feel a lot more pornographic to me this time around2 the burning of the idols was a very powerful scene visually but lost impact because the faith of the seven has never been establishedexplained the series has so many characters and plot lines to juggle that i understand perfectly well why they dont want to spend time explaining the different religions as well but i was watching it with people who havent read the books and their reaction was to ask are these statues supposed to be important what do they mean why havent we heard of this before and so on3 i loved maester cressens chapter in the book but although i agree that you dont understand his motivations for trying to kill melisandre properly with the way they did it in this episode i think it makes perfect sense that they did what they did they are already struggling to give enough screen time to much more important characters so i have no problem with cressens role being trimmed down like that4 i actually really liked both stannis and davos i see a lot of you didnt i dont think ill be able to say how i feel about melisandre before ive seen a bit more of her but i think she is beautiful not plain at all the davos character does seem to appear a bit out of nowhere and you dont really understand who or what he is if you dont already know but presumably this will be dealt with in episodes to come5 joffreys name day tournament felt really rushed i have no problem with it being a melee in stead of a joust but the dialogue didnt feel as refined as the writing from season 1 and the dontos story was clumsily done6 my problem with the tournament scene was really the same as my main problem with the episode as a whole i understand the challenges they faced in trying to fit all that information into one episode but too much of it ended up feeling rushed when i say rushed i dont just mean the pace of it or that some scenes were cut very short but also that some scenes simply felt unfinished this includes the cerseilittlefinger scene7 i agree that the crasters keep scene felt too hurried and that craster looked a bit too clean that being said i thought his acting was good and i liked the set my main problem was that it like many of you have said wasnt as scary as it could have been this might be getting into the realm of nitpicking but i also think it is a little bit problematic that it is the first thing you see beyond the wall they do mention that they have seen several abandoned villages on their way there but the way it was shown it felt a bit like that the keep was situated pretty much immediately outside the wall and you dont get a sense of the vast wilderness there really is8 i wanted to see much more of arry but that probably means that what we did see was pretty good tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp 9 10 danys weird interaction with rakharo whhhatttt in seven hells was that they better not get romantic yeah that felt really weird and wrong perhaps especially because it came seconds after she had a tender moment with jorah which was confusing dont know what was going on there my first thought was that they might be spoiler replacing daario with rakharo but i really dont know 10the scene with roberts bastards made it seem like he had fathered half the children in kings landingi actually really liked the slaying of the bastards ok it feels really wrong to say that but that it was gruesome to watch as i think it should be i didnt see it as robert having fathered hundreds of bastards but rather the gold cloaks slaying any baby in any house where robert was at any time rumored to have bedded a girl a bit like herod killing all the baby boys in bethlehem just to get rid of jesus and i thought that was appropriately horrifying11the actress playing catelyn has the most beautiful eyes not pleased to see a lot of her ideas coming out of robbs mouth though but i guess that fits in with what they were doing with her last seasoni too was a bit sad to see robb taking over so many of cats ideas but for the sake of the adaptation i think it makes sense it is important that they build up robb as a strong character and i think they are doing that well i actually really liked him in the scene with jaime12 apart from the killing of the babies i dont think it felt bleak and dangerous enough when reading the book one of my first impression that spoiler spoiler alert just to be safe the world of acok was even more deadly and dangerous than the world of agot with dead bodies lying in the streets of kings landing and along the kingsroad and the people starving and running from their homes from the moment tyrion arrives in kings landing you know that this is now a city at war im hoping there will be more of this in the later episodes though i guess what i am saying is that i wanted more of the kind of gruesomeness we saw when they were killing the bastards13 in terms of the acting i thought most of it was very good tyrion robb davos stannis and joffrey especially i never minded ros before but i thought her acting was terrible when she was repeating littlefingers lines from season 1 and i still find myself very confused about her and where they are going with her character14 i thought the wolf dream scene worked surprisingly well i was not sure they were even going to do that though not doing them would have made things very difficult laterthere really is a lot that i really liked about e01 as i hope you can tell and in addition to what i have mentioned i thought the cgi the music the intro and the cinematography were all pretty stunning but i just didnt like the episode as a whole i dont think it flowed well and my friends who have not read the books really struggled to keep upit seems odd that in many scenes like the littlefingercersei scene they seem to be afraid of being too subtle and so overexplain things whereas in other scenes they introduce characters and concepts davos melisandre the burning of the seven without any explanation at allin a way it felt like neither the first episode of a new season nor an episode in the middle of a bigger whole and i think that was the problem too many of the kings landing scenes felt very flat which is a shame as they are already struggling to get as much as possible out of the time theyve got i think it was a badly structured episode with many good elements in it and i think there is certainly potential for season 2 to be very good i just hope it doesnt take them too many episodes to get where they need to be edited by orangutangu 02 april 2012  0833 pm"

"Faceless_Girl",2012-04-03,"i gave it an 8 i really liked it overall the transitions between the comet scenes and the introductions of the new characters 1 i really like how they are fleshing out robbs character more in the show i missed that big time in the books and im not even a robb fangirl i just thought he deserved better he had a smart rebuttal for everything jamie said i like how he didnt let jamie get the upper hand in the conversation 2 i feel like im the only one that is really disappointed with stanniss voice the actor looks fine to me but his voice is just too high pitched i imagined a more gruff bitter sounding man 3 i really liked davos thought his look was perfect but was he wearing his finger necklace i couldnt tell 4 last season i really thought the casting was spot on ned walder frey greatjon drogo etc but this year it just seems a little  off maybe its just the lull between seasons and the fact that i read the book before this season had not read got when the show aired hopefully they will develop more and grow on me 5 crasters acting was good but he just wasnt scraggly looking enough he shouldve had a huge beard with bits of food in it 6 jon was actually annoying to me and i like him i hope his future scenes in the north really show him losing the naivety 7 i know its nitpicky but wtf was up with ser dontos he was not right at all isnt dontos supposed to be someone who thinks hes smart but is just drunk all the time he just looked like an oaf to me i suppose hell look good in motley 8 cersei 1000 lenas doing it for me this season im looking forward to her relishing the power 9 if the reeds arent showing up im really wondering how bran will find out about the knight of the laughing tree or was that in sos bc theres no way osha would know that 10 i really really really hope we are introduced to podrick oh and last but not least where was tyrions line to sansa youre as loyal as a deer surrounded by wolves and then her lions slip up that does so much for her character and redemption showing that she still hates the lannisters"

"Tadco26",2012-04-04,"i gave it an 8 i liked most of the episode but there were a few things that bothered me for me i can understand changes that have to be made due to budget constraints and time what i dont care for is changes that seem to be made almost randomly that dont appear to have any bearing on budget time constraints or the need to show something that a pov character thinks internally in the books some thoughts in no particular order 1 ros didnt bother me much in this episode but requoteing my least favorite scene from the first season should have been cut if that was supposed to be the pay off for watching littlefinger personally training his whores in s1 then consider it a double failure in my eyes now if there were 12 episodes this season this wouldnt bother me so much but when the average chapter of material is covered in 5 minutes or less then this scene doesnt deserve to be in over conversations and content that was more interesting and had to be cut due to time constraints 2 i wasnt surprised or too disappointed by the shortened version of cressens fate except for the fact that he drank and started dieing before she had even sipped the wine even if melisandre had no powers or protection she wouldnt have died in that scenario she simply would have dumped the wine out after he started bleeding out his nose these seemingly random changes from the original are the ones that tend to bother me the most i do think another minute or two of conversation between davos and cressen or cressen and stannis could have added alot to the end result as well 3 i liked stannis and davos though they had such a small amount of screen time that there wasnt much to judge them on either way other than looks 4 joffreys name day tournament was off i have no problem with it being a melee in stead of a joust but it could have been to first blood and not the death if the melee already is to the death then why would sansa risk her life to save a drunken fool and why would joffrey believe that it was bad luck to have someone killed on your name day when someone was killed minutes before that by the hound i also didnt really even get the impression that dontos was that drunk this wasnt a big deal to me but it did bug me a little 5 i agree with the people that say that the littlefingercersei scene was out of character for him the scene was well acted and well directed but the creation of the scene actually gave us contrary information about littlefinger to what the books did in a show that really needs to focus its limited screen time on enforcing the characters motivations actions and thoughts 6 crasters scenes were ok to me but i do think that craster looked more like a lord than a wildling i expected him to look more like the wildlings that attacked bran with osha 7 the rakharo scene was odd 8 i liked the addition of showing the killing of roberts bastards but it doesnt make much sense that joffrey would order it first off joffrey always 100 believed robert was his father cersei absolutely wanted to diminish the chances of someone else furthering stannis rumor after all 2 different hands had put the puzzle together partially due to them cersei is supposed to be a ruthless and heartless ruler not sure why they are trying to add more to joffreys crimes when he has plenty without any help 9 speaking of joffrey and cersei i thought the slap and joffreys response was totally contrasting their relationship in the books especially at that point joffrey could not have ordered cersei killed or at least he couldnt have ordered it and expected the order to be followed she is the reagent and in fact one of the only ways some of joffreys actions in the books are curtailed is by threatening joffrey that they will tell cersei what he is doing for example spoiler tyrion preventing the public disrobing of sansa if joffrey truely has complete control to do whatever he wants then there is no way tyrion would survive his time at court 10 robbs parts were well acted and i liked all the stark scenes i would have preferred cat kept her independence and input but it didnt bother me as much as some of the other changes 11 the special effects scenery and costumes were all excellent especially by tv standards 12 glad to see the wolf dreams 13 i agree that in many scenes like the littlefingercersei scene they seem to be afraid of being too subtle and so overexplain things whereas in other scenes they introduce characters and concepts davos melisandre the burning of the seven without any explanation at all now it may seem like i didnt like the episode because i went much more in depth on what i didnt like than what i did but i think complaints made among fans require more justification than compliments do i did give it an 8 over all edited by tadco26 04 april 2012  1012 pm"

"King Bolton",2012-04-05,"it flitted around a little to much although this is perhaps expected with the opening episode i gave it at 9 because i think you have to appreciate the difficulty the writersdirectors are under in an opening episode you really want to be covering all the main characters and their situations and when you add to this problem an influx of new characters things obviously become even more difficult however if every episode is structured this way it wont be very good i mean they cant continue using the comet link  that would wear thin very quickly and it would be frustrating to see about 7 minutes of each key character for me they have to base it around locations and have half the locations one episode and the other half the next but i could be wrong have to wait and seee"
"An Ironborn Son",2012-04-05,"im going to start with two things that i really really liked the first being the moment where stannis brings forth the flame sword for me this will go down as the first real moment of grandeur this season roberts elder brother is ready to throw down and that scene came across beautifully the other was lord mormonts reaction to jon snow yes i know that jon was a little out of character in the way that he reacted but it gave the lord commander a chance to talk it through with him and provide a key bit of mentoring i thought all of the new characters were great though i had similar problems as others did with dontos and craster i think in my head that i pictured dontos as being more quixotic as a drunk and not just looking like a more out of place samwell although he may surprise us well have to wait and see i think for craster it was more that i didnt get the overall feel that i wanted it didnt seem like a more than slightly dangerous place to be i also thought that this would be the scene that if you were new to the show and had only seen season 1 this would probably seem out of place as youd be waiting to see if jon was going to do something more related to the other characters shaes portrayal continues to bother me and i dont blame the actress i think it more has to do with her lines being akin to storm in the first xmen movie basically shaes supposed to be a worldly gal who isnt just a floozy and has substance but you wouldnt know it from her very basic and cliched lines i keep reminding myself that this girl has captivated one of the greatest minds in the empire and i just cant see it with the bland pillow talk that seems to fall from her mouth i know that hbo wants her to be some sort of sexpot vixen but whoever is directing them needs to tell her to try a less is more approach to the whole thing as to that my biggest beef with the brothel scene is that it is setting something up but how big can this moment really be readers of the book can probably figure out where im going with that notion but it seems like the whole scene then gets digested as nothing more than an execution which kind of takes away from eddards death a death that worked so well because it comes out of almost no where and is a shown act of violence where so much of the other acts of brutality are off stage bringing it to the forefront seems like a mistake i give the acting an overall 8 i give the feeling and mood after the episode a 10 i give the pacing and build up a 5"

"Tywin's bastard",2012-04-02,"it wasnt exactly like littlefinger to test the waters like that but i dont think it really hurts the character he doesnt come off as any more of a threat to cersei less if anything so it doesnt change his chances to avoid being murdered or to pull off what he does his brilliance is only truly shown in the book after his actions are exposed and this doesnt change how you can do that since it doesnt set up any hinders i dont care too much about the change nitpicking doesnt get me anywhere the scene is for me about two things to show that cersei does wield power despite that shes lost control over joffrey and more importantly its a commentary on the subject of power it will obviously tie in thematically with the discussion varys and tyrion will have as heard in a trailer in that sense it works well"
"_Oberyn_",2012-04-02,"it did not bother me that much except for the guard drilling wich was a very weak way to make a point about power joffrey scene seemed a bit off though hes too insecure to threaten cersei if he can do that what is he going to do when tyrion kicks the shit out of him"

"Dr. Pepper",2012-04-02,"i actually thought it was a clever scene yes it seemed out of character for littlefinger to show his hand but it also reminded viewers that he is a player in the games and pointed out that the one holding the knowledge holds a very powerful weapon indeed but i think the focus of the scene is more on cersei she says power is power but the only true power she displayed is that she has paid for the loyalty of her guards its amusing to those of us whove read the books because we know that cersei really starts to tumble when she loses those shes paid to be loyal to her without her paid mercenaries shes not really anything shes been replaced as advisor to the king by tyrion shes on notice with joffrey her power is fleeting"
"WinterWarrior",2012-04-02,"i think an important part of the lfcersei exchange was what she said to get it started of a story about an upstart lf growing up in a household above his rank tully and loving the eldest daughter cat but not being able to have her it appeared to me that this part of the exchange is setting up the understanding of the events in book 3 probably season 4 of the hbo series and the sansa story this probably was a warning from cersei as well that if lf had any special love for the tullys and thus the starks she was keeping an eye on him seems inconsistent with his betrayal of ned stark but she is paranoid cats husband is dead and lf might still have notions of marrying her someday edited by winterwarrior 02 april 2012  0814 am"
"Lord Varys",2012-04-02,"the scene is still clearly uncharacteristic for littlefinger but it is not nearly as bad as i believed it would be 1 littlefinger does not throw the twincest directly into her face he merely brings the topic up after stannis has sent his letters it is more a reference to a rumor not a threat to against cerseijaime or joffreys claim to the iron throne 2 cersei starts this whole thing by provoking littlefinger with his past with catelyn tvlittlefinger is still obsessed with cat he has not yet replaced cat with sansa in his mind this will no doubt come after he interacts with cat at renlys camp 3 cersei apparently does not really feel threatened by littlefingers words she tries to teach him a lesson what truly is power and i think this is coherent with both the tv and bookcersei both seem to believe that those atop the food chain can decide by decree what is true or false of course the real littlefinger would not make such a mistake he would not let allow himself to be provoked but such a remark but i guess he would have heard stuff about his humble past again and again even as master of coin and he would be pissed about this but he would hold his tongue littlefinger does not threaten he is not even particularly aggressive when he declares to somebody tyrion in acok that from now on they will be mortal enemies remember the whole please keep me out of your little intrigues from now onthing id have preferred it if littlefinger had been portrayed more as a funny guy whose cunning and depths are only gradually revealed but unfortunately they did not go that way in the series"

"Bolivar",2012-04-02,"i did agree with the sites review at one point i had to question if they had brought on a new actor because it did not even seem like the same acting style from the previous season i thought it was uncharacteristic for the character in both the book and the tv show last season my bigger problem with the scene was that it was gratuitous im worried that the producers are running away with the material  theyve found what the viewers like and now theyre overembellishing on it the scene was pretty pointless and its troubling why they chose to write it and leave out comedic gold like tyrions it doesnt seem fair why you should open your legs for one brother and not for the other comment"
"Dracarya",2012-04-02,"i thought it was unrealistic for both characters  i love the way lena headey plays cersei but i dont like the direction they appear to be taking her this season i felt that littlefinger would never allow himself to get caught up in such a way  hes more clever than that well see littlefinger isnt my favourite character but he is brilliant in his own way and its a shame they seem to be changing that"

"aghrivaine",2012-04-02,"im crossposting this from the general discussion thread apologies if thats redundant hallo all most of what i felt has been said already as is so often the case but ill chime in on the littlefingercersei confrontation like a lot of you probably did i rewatched the last season over the weekend this time with the commentaries on i noticed that again and again the writers actors director producers  all mentioned over and over the relationship this seems to be the lens through which they are approaching the story  a series of relationships that taken together constitute a plot i understand that an actor will necessarily have to thoroughly comprehend his or her characters relationship to the other people in the scene its what makes their interactions breathe and seem real but i think its now officially been taken too far  as this confrontation seemed to exist solely to flesh out cersei and littlefingers relationship they are both wielders of soft power  however much it galls both of them and theyre both competing for the same influence and authority as is varys but hes just better at keeping his cards close to his chest i dont think this scene shed any particular light on their individual characters or their relationships to each other that wouldnt have been clear from previous or eventual interactions further from a screenwriting perspective their dialogue  and especially littlfingers  is far too on the nose meaning it exactly states what the characters ambition or desire is rather than illustrating it through other means that one scene stuck out like a sore thumb as being both unnecessary and poorly written both actors approached it like champs though and so it wasnt completely wasted but it definitely stuck out to me contrast that with the confrontation between robb and jaime here we go with more relationsihps i predict in the commentary for this season both actors will say such an interesting relationship our characters have in this we see a genuine change in robb he is becoming the picture of a rebel leader who has the sangfroid to stare down one of the most feared knights in the world and sees the situation for what it is not a complete victory but a strong position that he is trying to leverage for even more gain and doesnt that make what we all know will happen to robb that much more tragic series robb is even more likeable than book robb whereas jaime is clearly rattled by his captivity and by being menaced by a direwolf but by golly he will not let it show and i thought this was a particularly fine acting job by costerwaldau who deftly managed portraying a man who experiences fear and trepidation but doesnt let it color his actions or words at all that was a great scene wellwritten and well portrayed plus  direwolf i hope the rest of season 2 will diverge from the books less than this initial episode"
"Strider",2012-04-02,"maybe this scene is a little bit out of character for littlefinger as portrayed in the book but its such a minor change its good to see that littlefinger has his own vulnerability hes touchy about his lack of name and fortune as well as his failure to win catelyn and so overplays his hand in response to cerceis insult which in turn gives cercei an opportunity to demonstrate her power and put him in his place yes booklittlefinger would not have allowed himself to be provoked but for the benefit of the viewers who have not read the books its not unhelpful to get an idea about what is really driving littlefinger its not all about greed and lust for power"

"Hyper",2012-04-02,"i wasnt bothered by the scene a bit out of character for both book cersei and book littlefinger but not by much imo it is a scene that plausibly could have occurred outside the povs in the book  it does not contradict anything in the books i think it had two reasons for existing and executed both well 1 showcase for tv viewers that littlefinger is not just a lannister stooge 2 showcase how they view power differently a theme of the episodeseason no doubt edited by hyper 02 april 2012  0133 pm"

"Charles F. Peterson",2012-04-02,"ultimately the scene wasnt damaging to the episode and did show cersis arrogance a central aspect of her character however the scene was not accurate in the portrayal of the characters littlefinger may jibe jape or insinuate but he never directly confronts cersi due to her positioning as a woman and her over confidence sees herself as a manipulator and intriguer she believes that she is on par with varys she enjoys delivering the blow but concealing the source her flexing like that is way out of character"
"Skywarpgold",2012-04-02,"i didnt think it was out of character for either of them at all littlefinger always thinks he has everything under control while cersei just kind of blunders into things without thinking of the consequences how could he predict what someone who doesnt think before they act will do i absolutely loved what i can only assume to be one of varyss little birds eavesdropping on the whole thing while washing the floor edited by skywarpgold 02 april 2012  0416 pm"
"DragonAge93",2012-04-02,"i didnt mind the scene at all really sure it seems uncharacteristic of him but this coulda happened offpage you never know i think he said it because either 1 he wanted to show cersei knowledge is power and that with knowledge you command everything in a sense or 2 he got pissed when cersei talked about his sigil and his travesty with the tullys and wanted to put her in her place for a quick second edited by dragonage93 02 april 2012  0412 pm"
"The Anti-Targ",2012-04-02,"definitely the low point for the episode i can sorta see why they did it create tension between cersei and lf and put him firmly on the path to betrayal be we know he already has a motive his obsession with catelyn but i suppose they wanted to create a direct conflict was probably one of my main deductions in terms of scoring the episode i think its what elio was referring to in the season 2 preview as being quite out of character for lf and hence not well received if nothing else lf would never challenge anyone in a situation where his flesh could meet steel so baiting cersei like that would be ok if she wasnt surrounded by 4 bodyguards"
"Tourne-Toujours",2012-04-02,"i liked the scene for the simple reason that i didnt expect to see it it caught me by surprise also it adds a personal element between cersei and littlefinger relating to the events of joffreys wedding"
"Elaena Targaryen",2012-04-02,"i dont think the scene was that bad for a few reasons first for cersei i felt there was a flow with her story she is very upset about tyrion and then its pointed out to her that her tywin was so mad at what happened with ned that he sent tyrion there of all people then tyrion tells cersei how upset their father will be when he finds out arya is missing and we know how she cant stand to be a disappointment to her father next we see her trying to fix this situation by ruthless and desperate measures with lf which he brings up the incest then cersei and joff her beloved son and king is so angry about the gossip and that there might be bastards and then he basically threatens her life what happens after thisentire brutal baby killing i think it flows nice in cerseis story someone asserts their power over her then she finds someone to lash out at classic bully stuffshe has to make herself feel better and assert her power over some one tyrion strong arms cersei so she does it even more violently to lf next joff strong arms cersei so she does it even more violently to the bastards i think part of the baby killing was to fix things with joff but also to wield power as well as removing any threat the same goes with the lf scene because she needs to wield power but cersei also must fix the arya problem now for lf and part of this will go back to cersei i think it shows that maybe cersei has not been so aggressive in the past well now lf knows for sure what he will be dealing with now that she has more control and power i also thinks this helps set up the baby killing because everyone is bringing the incest up and using it to insult and belittle her which she will not allow im not sure where they will go with all of this but it could set up some things if this season we see lf looking like he is totally on cerseis side supporting her and helping her then after this scene we will know better even with his scenes from last season it could have been a little confusing for those who have not read the books and they have to take that in consideration i think this could set up how smooth lf really is later if they go that way it shows that cersei does not deal with power well and how unstable she is and no matter what lf is not cerseis lackey or lannisters for that matter and we know why with her specifically plus lf is just a man not some super hero but im sure he will get her back somehow i guess we will have to wait and see it could go either way and i hope they dont ruin lf character i wonder if this is setting up some scenes between lf and cat later on isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t there a scene where cat holds a knife to lf throat"
"Frozen Soul",2012-04-02,"im thinking the scene may have actually been uncharacteristic for cersei as well power is power sounds like something robert would say whereas cersei has always played the game from the shadows manipulating others for more cloak  dagger worknot really she is always going on about how she is a lannister of casterly rock and her pride she thinks that as queen she is above everyone else meaning she can do as she likes because she was born with that right shes of a noble house and people should just shut the fuck up and do as commanded why should she hide it she thinks very little of almost anyone how she manipulates others is another matter she sees herself as a cunning mastermind of sorts ala lf or varys but she is rather messyif not affc and part of adwd shows thati liked the scene because it showed some of that it may have been a little out of character for lf but it works as for robert his line would ve probably been something like seven hells just give me my hammer while holding something with wine on his other hand edited by frozen soul 02 april 2012  0553 pm"
"Skeksi",2012-04-02,"hmmm well this was probably my least favourite scene on the one hand it wasnt as bad as id feared you get a little tension from both sides and the actors do a good job with the scene but it just doesnt seem in character with littlefinger in either the book or the first series both of which protray him as a clever manipulator to have him push quite that far with cersei when she is surrounded by armed lannister bodyguards that part of the scene just felt a little clunky i mean if they want to show why littlefinger is working against cersei well theyve already introduced the concept of his past with cat his views towards sansa as a younger version of cat something which is presumably going to be expanded upon later theyve already confirmed that he wants power all the power there is which isnt really compatible with cersei and her son running the seven kingdoms surely thats enough reason and if not they could have shown her needling him about his past as she was in the earlier part of the scene without having him blunder so obviously to emphasise that she doesnt really trust like him and he has no reason to be fond of her either it seems very needless if this is the point of the scene his scenes with varys worked despite their threats because both of them are on reasonably equal footing both know that the other is playing a bigger game than they seem to be both know things that could harm the other and both know that the other knows that they know they balance each other out by holding enough information about the other to be reasonably certain that the other wont risk exposing them whilst knowing that the other knows enough to not want to risk themselves by exposing the other if that makes any sense this scene doesnt work because cersei is a surrounded by armed guards belonging to her family coolpng classbbcemoticon altb  has power over lf and can publicly order him killed if necessary and c has no real information to threaten him with as varys did therefore her response will almost certainly be physical threat probably death much as i love littlefinger this was probably my least favourite scene of the episode the actors did a good job but it didnt seem to work especially since lf gets about 1 other line in the episode after having him plot and scheme throughout series 1 most of what we see of him in this episode puts him across as him having dropped a few levels of smarts that said it was the low point in an otherwise enjoyable episode and i have reasonable faith that other lf scenes will be somewhat more in line with the books s1 portrayal of the character cersei is obviously being put across as quite a different character from the books and i have no issue with that"
"Caro99",2012-04-02,"personally i didnt really mind the scene but after discussing it with my best friend and with other loyal fans in diffrent fourms i came up with a theory that would have made me like the scene a little more and would make better sense maybeso we know that lf was probably the one to give joff the idea of chopping poor neds head since initially he was just going to be punished and be sent to the wall cersei was not aware that an execution was going to take place and in the books i dont remember reading she ever finds out lf had something to do with it could be wrong though still i would have prefered if after she orders the guards to leave lf alone she wouldve walked up to him and whisper something like and dont you ever advise my son behind my back for you gain or something it wouldve come off imo as a better reason for excusing cerseis behaviour here of course the twincest hit the heart of the matter but i can also see her advising lf to be carefulwell thats one theory at least dunnogif classbbcemoticon altdunno "
"dtones520",2012-04-02,"for a tv audience you have to somehow build up the characters you are showing especially one who plays a big role in e series like littlefinger you have to know his backstory and why he is who he is without the brothel scene in season one and this scene in season 2 you dont really get to know littlefinger and why he does what he does you could have some random conversations thrown in other scenes but these add dramatic effect i dont really think anything in that scene is out of character for cersei littlefinger maybe a bit but it does show off his cockiness which i picked up in the books its not like he was saying anything cersei and jaime out of the blue it was after everyone had already gotten stannis letter"
"LauraD",2012-04-02,"i was confused by the scene but not because of mischaracterization while cersei was going nuts in the book with her paranoia littlefinger was never a major harbor for her fears i didnt like the confrontation only because it didnt need to be between those twoin the books i saw their relationship as frustratingly mutually dependent each working dutifully to try and become selfreliant littlefinger through conniving possession of harrenhal sansa then the eyrie then the vale cersei through surrounding herself with sychophants and morons they never trusted or liked each other but they would never threaten each other it would have been counterproductive to their ulterior motivesbasically in the books and i could very well be wrong there was never any outward aggression between the two and the show sort of missed a mark of understanding their delicate political dance with this nothing devastating just a bit of an error"
"Skeksi",2012-04-02,"yes if anything cersei seems to get on better with littlefinger than most of the rest of the small council in the book especially when he suggests spreading rumours about stannis and his daughter she seems quite delighted with him the rest of the time she doesnt seem to give him much thought at all"

"DannySpud",2012-04-02,"reposting my thoughts on this scene from the episode discussion threadin regards to the lfc scene if cersei hadnt threatened littlefinger with death then i dont think anyone would have a problem lf in that scene its pretty incharacter for lf to poke back when someone pokes at him especially when someone tries to outknowledge him lf knows hes reasonably secure lifewise being the master of coin so he has room for his pokes cersei on the other hand has just had her power questioned and wants to exercise it i think the scene works well also in giving us books people a wtf moment"

"Purah",2012-04-03,"at first i really disliked this scene and like most people here felt that booklf would never have been provoked or slipped up that badly but then again it kind of puts the viewers through the same scenario that the readers went through in the first few books i mean come off it who didnt think that cercei was some kind of master manipulator to begin with it also puts lf off the radar cercei now thinks that she has him under her control she wont suspect him of his various plots schemes or of being the magnificent bastard that we all love so all in allit kind of works and i have read in a review that littlefinger redeems himself in episode 4 so lets just wait and see laughpng classbbcemoticon altlaugh  analysis aside maybe he did it because varys is neglecting him lolgif classbbcemoticon altlol "
"Songlian",2012-04-03,"i actually thought it was a clever scene yes it seemed out of character for littlefinger to show his hand but it also reminded viewers that he is a player in the games and pointed out that the one holding the knowledge holds a very powerful weapon indeedbut i think the focus of the scene is more on cersei she says power is power but the only true power she displayed is that she has paid for the loyalty of her guards its amusing to those of us whove read the books because we know that cersei really starts to tumble when she loses those shes paid to be loyal to her without her paid mercenaries shes not really anything shes been replaced as advisor to the king by tyrion shes on notice with joffrey her power is fleetingthis is my opinion as well i liked the scene a lot despite littlefingers out of character moment because it sets cersei as the weighing my words here shallow thing she is power is power to me is very much like bookcersei who lost her game exactly because she couldnt see further than her own nose and the movie sets that up nicelyof course this is all from the perspective of someone who knows how cersei will end up im curious what nonreaders of the book think of the characters after that scene"
"stevelabny",2012-04-03,"except its pretty clear that this wasnt a move to baffle or confuse  he was trying to be clever and then nearly needed a new set of pants because of the mess he made winkpng classbbcemoticon alt i dont think littlefingers supposed to be a brilliant thespian  when hes genuinely shocked or surprised hell show it if its a big enough problem facing himi dont think its a move to baffle or confuse i think its a move to throw cersei off we dont see enough of varys and petyrs tiny moves in the books the ones that throw the other players off the scent of their bigger game but they clearly have to happen or else theyd both be dead or unemployedcersei started the goading littlefinger responded with the rumors hed already heard he knows it makes him look petty he knows it makes him look like he doesnt have deeper secrets and he know it makes him look like he just found out when he utters the words he knows cersei will either say something back and walk away feeling shes won or that she will huff back to her chambers thinking lf thinks hes more clever than he is these both serve his purposehes not expecting cersei to suddenly threaten his life there is no way he could have forseen that overreaction when robert was around cersei would never have been so reckless cersei is already starting to fray at the edges with joff beheading ned and tyrion returning and telling her shes the disappointing child what she does totally catches him off guard but now he has more information for the future and yes if she would have gone through with it hed be dead and that kind of random whim can happen to anyone at anytime there is no defense no matter how clever you arei actually like the scene because i feel it is a perfect example of what had to be happening between the pages of the books"
"WinterWarrior",2012-04-03,"the hbo series does not have the time or luxury of developing these characters slowly i think scenes like this are meant to set the stage for understanding later actions so things are magnified because the story line has to move forward more quickly and i think the actress who plays cersei is not a good actress i love the show but i loathe cersei and am tired of the actress sitting there with her brow wrinkled looking out she has no expression in her face just that wrinkled brow i dont like her at all as cersei and sometimes wonder if she is even acting in a separate vein i wish martin had made cersei suffer even more than her walk of shame in book 5 but i dont want to get off topic as a woman i find her offensive to all women and joffrey is a result of her ambitious mothering"

"Peter1982",2012-04-03,"i thought it was perfectly ok it is about power this year what was it last year about and they wanted to make a point on the screen you have to do that in this way lf did not sought any provocation but reacted he was still playing the master in trying to learn cersei something but ofcourse she doesnt listen i dont think lf is so off the character in the book the tv series creates a lot more around robb and joffrey as to battling kings and i think it makes great television seeing the drama of the coming year will only be even more terrible at such moments i wish i hadnt read the books  which i enjoyed immensely just to experience the thrill of it"
"kairparavel",2012-04-03,"but if the point was about perception of power and not specifically lf and cersei why not keep the brilliant book conversation between varys and tyrion after jonas slynt is sent to the wall to me that exchange really nails home the idea of power and perception of power and no one needs act out of character"
"Bolivar",2012-04-03,"and i think the actress who plays cersei is not a good actress i love the show but i loathe cersei and am tired of the actress sitting there with her brow wrinkled looking out she has no expression in her face just that wrinkled brow i dont like her at all as cersei and sometimes wonder if she is even acting in a separate vein i wish martin had made cersei suffer even more than her walk of shame in book 5 but i dont want to get off topici like cerseis portrayal in the show but i had to laugh about the whole wrinkled brow part its definitely true we need a little bit more range than just the elegant talking and the wrinkled brow lolalso i thought the walk of shame was shallow fanservice it didnt need to be in the book martin could have actually had a climax or two in the book instead of those superfluous tackedon scenes"
"Carl Drogo",2012-04-03,"i dont think its a move to baffle or confuse i think its a move to throw cersei off we dont see enough of varys and petyrs tiny moves in the books the ones that throw the other players off the scent of their bigger game but they clearly have to happen or else theyd both be dead or unemployedcersei started the goading littlefinger responded with the rumors hed already heard he knows it makes him look petty he knows it makes him look like he doesnt have deeper secrets and he know it makes him look like he just found out when he utters the words he knows cersei will either say something back and walk away feeling shes won or that she will huff back to her chambers thinking lf thinks hes more clever than he is these both serve his purposehes not expecting cersei to suddenly threaten his life there is no way he could have forseen that overreaction when robert was around cersei would never have been so reckless cersei is already starting to fray at the edges with joff beheading ned and tyrion returning and telling her shes the disappointing child what she does totally catches him off guard but now he has more information for the future and yes if she would have gone through with it hed be dead and that kind of random whim can happen to anyone at anytime there is no defense no matter how clever you arei actually like the scene because i feel it is a perfect example of what had to be happening between the pages of the bookscompletely agree and feel the same way i also think it helps to interpret the scene as cersei wanting to mostly give him a good scare for his cheek and not as a serious altercation that will completely change their relationship in my understanding they both know she needs him which is why it makes sense that he would have been so shocked at her reaction"
"hesitantreader",2012-04-03,"i dont like the scene because i dont think they have much screen time to show that tyrion is in control over the lannister power base in kings landing now by giving cersei jedi control over the lannister house guards it muddies the water all i can think is that they are going to play down the tyrioncersei conflict in this season and save it for season 3as for lf being a bit out of character i think it is necessary they need to show the tv viewers that lf dislike of ned does not extend to catelyn otherwise future plot developments will make little sense i would not be surprised to see them double down on this plot element later in the season edited by hesitantreader 03 april 2012  1135 am"
"Ran",2012-04-03,"the tv viewers can get the picture just fine without that poorlyconcieved scene promise"
"Strider",2012-04-03,"i rewatched the episode last night the lfc scene fits in nicely in many ways this episode is all about cersei finally she has managed to establish herself in a position of real power and independence yet it is immediately threatened by 1 stanniss publication of her incest 2 the disappearance of arya 3 joffreys developing independence embodied in his decision to execute ned and threatening his mother with execution if she should ever rebuke him again and 4 tyrions appointment by her disappointed father as temporary hand of the king her position has become vulnerable and increasingly desperate and so she teases littlefinger and when he responds in kind she humiliates him thereby assuring herself that she has and can exercise power would the booklf have responded as hbolf perhaps not  but i find it refreshing that he made a tiny misstep here he momentarily forgot his vulnerability he wont make that mistake again but as several people have observed the hbo series needs to be appreciated on its own terms and not by comparison to the books not an easy thing to do i know"
"WinterWarrior",2012-04-03,"i do think this scene and all of the references to arya in the episode are played up more than in the book i dont remember them looking that hard for arya or thinking she was that important gendry is the one they are looking for in the book arya seems to pass under the radar but for the hbo series i can understand why they made the lannister search for arya more prominent again its laying the groundwork for the future and keeping arya in the light as a major character and i love the hbo series for what it is"
"Brewmaster",2012-04-03,"i didnt have a problem with the scene if i think about it in terms of the book yeah it never would have gone down that way but its not the book and i see it as being fairly consistant with cerseis changing characterization as she gains more power moving forward i dont believe he was making a threat he was trying to ingratiate her to him by pointing out that he was a man that could be trusted to keep or spread rumors depending on the situation he did much the same to ned in season 1 also i dont believe littlefinger was ever in danger cersei wasnt going to have him killed just saying that she could it was a little hamhanded display of their current stations really it didnt really add anything to the story for me as somebody who is well aware of everyones situations and positions but i think it was a perfectly acceptable scene in the show for the non book reader"
"DornishKnight",2012-04-03,"the scene showed two things for me 1 lf has major overconfidence issues i think this will be his undoing in twow 2 it was nice foreshadowing about cerseis lack of understanding how the game is played power is power keep telling yourself that girl"
"mmp",2012-04-03,"the exchange wasnt out of character for lf or cersei but the guard square dancing routine was ridiculous"
"A Bong of Ice and Fire",2012-04-03,"this scene might have killed the series for me to be honest it was so out of character for lf and just plain wrong what were the producers thinking theyve just destroyed the whole lf character season 1 was great and felt very true to the books a lot of the key dialogue was almost 11 from the books but it looks like for season 2 the writers are doing more of their own interpretation and inventing too much stuff not only was the lfcersei scene unforgiveable they also managed to take the whole maester cressen prologue sequence which was one the most emotionally powerful  memorable sequences in the whole book series and turn it to crap and what the hell was up with the gq craster"
"The Black Wolf",2012-04-03,"i liked the scene particularly the oh wait ive changed my mindmoment but it did seem a bit reckless on lfs part to try to sort of brag about his power like that his whole strategy basically builds on people not seeing him as a threat why would he start threatening people then but overall i really enjoyed it and i guess even a man like petyr baelish can slip and act on his emotions sometimes"
"James Arryn",2012-04-03,"the only way i see it consistent with lf is his seeming inability to not make the jibe even when it seems against his interests that said this was several steps beyond that i think were supposed to see it as an example of how raw the cat wound still is more i think this was a more important scene for cersei as off as the scene played in terms of bookcontext i think it played well for her tv character one of the biggest challenges with interpreting a book to film is externalizing internal content and i think this and the slap gave us a flash of her defensiveness and temper that isnt otherwise evident most of the time also that it followed a dressingdown from tyrion and by proxy her father shes supposed to be upset i didnt really like the scene and i think the power is power thing could have been done without as much choreography which made it seem a tad less realisticbut if youre not watching it with the priority of how it fits with the book its not horrible i do agree that lfs voice was off too something about the whole scene seemed starched edited by james arryn 04 april 2012  0101 am"
"teemo",2012-04-03,"i think were supposed to see it as an example of how raw the cat wound still isits still raw i guess that makes sense tv show wise in the first season i remember when cat was leaving kl ned said something like he still loves you you know that wasnt in the book i think the show may be trying to show that hes still in love with cat or something in the books it doesnt really seems like he gives a shit anymore to be honest"
"Envie",2012-04-03,"i really think they put this scene in as an opener for the turn of events to come with littlefinger taking sansa away the viewers who havent read the books wont have quite all the back story and details that readers have and the season wont have time to cover it all considering the immense amount of political detail the second book had in leading up to some fairly surprising turn of events in the end theyre definitely portraying lord baelish as much more openly antagonistic as with his constant verbal sparring with varys and so this slip with cersei seemed as good a way as any to show the audience in the opening episode that things between the queen and littlefinger are definitely going to take a turn for the worse also im pretty certain non readers dont yet realize cerseis downfall is on its way and so theyre likely adding a lot more dramatic hints to that right now it looks like shes on top of her game but the clever viewer will notice that her slip is showing a bit even in that scene"
"Purah",2012-04-03,"also im pretty certain non readers dont yet realize cerseis downfall is on its way and so theyre likely adding a lot more dramatic hints to that right now it looks like shes on top of her game but the clever viewer will notice that her slip is showing a bit even in that sceneexactly its setting the scene for things that are already occuring in the booksi think another problem with this scene is that we know so little of lf in the books and as he is a wonderfully interesting character the fandom has produced quite an image of him as untouchable puppetmaster who has made crossing the moralline his personal hobby hbo been given the task of interpreting a character who does not have much canon material regarding his inner thoughts or goals it reminded us that lf is still only human and plays dangerously which will make his actions in later seasons seem a lot more impressive not only that but it gives him motive against cercei i hope i wasnt the only one who thought that he looked really angry and as the books have taught uswhen littlefingers pissed off he gets very very nasty as ned and tyrion discover"
"Frozen Soul",2012-04-03,"its still raw i guess that makes sense tv show wise in the first season i remember when cat was leaving kl ned said something like he still loves you you know that wasnt in the book i think the show may be trying to show that hes still in love with cat or something in the books it doesnt really seems like he gives a shit anymore to be honest spoiler i think he actually gives a lot of fucks for example sansa being cat 20 or lysas death he wants power and to show it others and imo that comes from being belittled all his life but the one thing that he could never get his hands on was cat i dont think hell let go of that"
"Independent George",2012-04-03,"ugh this is my fifth attempt at posting a replyi want to be clear the reason i dislike the scene is not because its different from the books its because its worse than the books my favorite scene in s1 was robert  cerseis private dialogue my second favorite scene was tywin  jaimes scene together both of them brought added dimensions to characters we barely saw in the books due to pov limitations likewise i loved the cerseijoffrey scene in the throne room  its inconsistent with their relationship in the books but it works brilliantly on the showcerseilittlefinger though weakens both characters it directly contradicts littlefingers brothel soliloquy in s1 and not in a good way instead of adding depth it makes him a much more shallow character instead of understanding who cersei is to get what he wants he goads her with no apparent gain instead of showing him as the man he became and how he was influenced by his childhood experience theyre showing him as the boy he once was as if he never grew up and grew wiser cersei on the other hand is portrayed as the exact opposite of the person she portrayed in the scene they just cut from thats not depth and thats not complexity thats a writer unable to decide what he wants moreover there were several easy subtle changes that could have gotten all the points they wanted to get across without losing the characterizations1 littlefinger should have been the source on where roberts bastards are hiding especially since he already likely is in both the show and the books 2 when cersei asks him to find arya he can allude to the incest without threatening her but instead move the subject over to the things he did know like where roberts bastards were this serves as direct contrast to what he told ned in s1 where he said he only knew that robert had more than ned3 he can also make a point of driving a wedge between tyrion and cersei by alluding possibly truthfully that tyrion seems more interested in using those rumors to enhance his own position rather than protecting cerseis and joffreys this points directly to tyrions closing to cersei earlier in the episode it must be strange for you being the disappointing child4 he can also make a power play against varys by pointing out that he is telling her where the bastards are but varys doesnt in the books varys takes care to protect roberts bastards it remains to be seen if this is also true in the show but it would add a lot of depth if they kept that"
"Vikingkingq",2012-04-04,"i think people are somewhat essentializing littlefinger to make him out as smarter than he actually is keep in mind 1 littlefinger built a criminal conspiracy on an easilydisprovable lie had either ned or catelyn checked what the bet was at joffreys nameday tourney  and this was a public bet varys renly and all the other members of the court would have seen and heard the bet being made  then littlefinger is immediately exposed and loses any ability to steer the starks where he needs to be while littlefinger is a planner hes not as patient as varys hes a gambler and prone to taking huge risks obliquely mentioning this rumor is a risk he takes to see if he can exert pressure on the queen 2 despite trying to steer ned he cant stop himself from needling him this is an inherent part of littlefingers character  hes a small bright boy in a world where boys are supposed to be jocks and he resents any man who fits into brandons image and needs to feel superior to everyone even when hes not are you really telling me that that man when hes just had his deepest darkest emotions shoved in his face doesnt snark back 3 littlefinger tends to underestimate people around him this is a guy who said i have varys balls in my hand  how big a miscalculation can you get"
"Lord Belmore",2012-04-04,"the scene was most shocking on my first watch of the episode and even then while i didnt like it i attempted to moderate my response now i still dont really like it in the context of littlefingers character but i get what theyre trying to do i also do not think it will hurt him much in the long run and i believe it could be a meaningful scene to refer to in the future as littlefinger gains more real power and prominence in the series the power line had the nice benefit of being both entertaining and showing cersei for what she is in an episode which otherwise cast her in a more sympathetic light it was really a great scene for the character of cerseijust not for my love of littlefinger thankfully im cognizant of my littlefinger mancrush so i try to avoid overreacting to any slight against him"
"teemo",2012-04-04,"spoiler i think he actually gives a lot of fucks for example sansa being cat 20 or lysas death he wants power and to show it others and imo that comes from being belittled all his life but the one thing that he could never get his hands on was cat i dont think hell let go of that that doesnt mean he still loves her though and my point was that the show seems to be pushing that on us for some reason however i definitely agree that his feelings for cat when he was young left a deep impression on him"

"Karene",2012-04-04,"i do really like lena headeys acting  browwrinkling and all i think it suits the character of cersei down to a tea i think we get browwrinkling because its the usually the highest level of anger cersei allows herself to display in front of a group in the book cersei is often portrayed to be polite to those around her whilst secretly wanting to slap them fiercely of course she fires up and loses control all the time but its usually when shes alone with someone especially tyrion i also see cersei as a woman who is very conscious of her appearance and its fitting to me that shed have several faces that shed put on the defiant head lift the glare the brow wrinkling the dismissive hand cersei likes to appear a certain way and i think lenas picked this up perfectly some women especially vain women have a variety of expressions they like to put on display in real life and in the book as to littlefinger in my opinion one of the most interesting characters in the book and the most dangerous  more so than varysillyrio my main problem with this scene is what has happened to aidan gillan i didnt notice it so much in the council scene but in the cerseilf scene aidan looks tired and plumper in the face and his voice has changed completely before he had a thin but distinct snakey voice now he sounds like hes got a harelip or cold is it the fake moustache hes wearing he both looks and sounds weaker imo not a fitting tribute to lf dont get me wrong i love aidan gillan but i love the aidan gillan of series 1 first and foremost"

"Brianne of Brooklyn",2012-04-05,"more importantly its a commentary on the subject of power it will obviously tie in thematically with the discussion varys and tyrion will have as heard in a trailer in that sense it works welli think overall this scene was to set up the theme of the season the debate about whether knowledge is power or power is power its a theme that runs throughout the books as we see characters develop change course and at various points have both physical and mental strengthwhile i agree it is was a bit uncharacteristic of lf who strangely enough i actually enjoy in the books because i like seeing how his minds works and how his machinations play out in the series i love him if only because im a huge fan of the wire it showed that hes not merely a mustachetwirling villain that there is something human under there whose buttons can be pushedafter reading the rest of the series i felt that this was totally in line with cersei especially after affc she wields her power left and right without realizing how fleeting it truly is"

"Jojen",2012-04-05,"i dont know if this has been brought up yet but they may have been trying to set up a parallel scene with the one between robb and jaime robb basically pulls a cersei when he uses grey wind to intimidate jaime but the reality is jaime held the power in that scene it just isnt immediately apparent"
"DannySpud",2012-04-06,"my gut reaction to that scene was that the producers were saying you might have read the books now but we can still surprise you and after thinking about it for a bit i dont think littlefinger was to blame cersei was looking for a fight lf was walking in the other direction when c caught up to him with a group of guards she doesnt usually walk around with a group of guards following her yes she goaded him but he was probably being a bit defensive faced with a group of guards and was trying to make it clear to her that he had just as much power as she did and that because her and jamie were practically public knowledge now she had less power than she used to she tried to show him otherwise it works within the context of the characters imo and if there is a fault with the scene it lies with cersei acting out of character not lf"

"R'hllor-Is-The-Truth",2012-04-07,"it did not bother me that much except for the guard drilling wich was a very weak way to make a point about powerjoffrey scene seemed a bit off though hes too insecure to threaten cersei if he can do that what is he going to do when tyrion kicks the shit out of himi think tyrion is under the protection of tywin lannister and everybody from kingsguard to the small folk know who tywin is and what he is capable of so i dont think tyrion is in any danger i think the scene between cersei and joffery is best scene in the episode i hate cersei so much even though they are clearly trying to make her more sympathetic all i could think of during that scene was another scene when cersei told joffery to fuck painted whores or noble virgins thats what you cersei for raising such a person"

"birdsong66",2012-04-08,"i didnt really mind the scene as a whole that said i did think it served two purposesfirst left the viewerreader still wondering if catelyn remains an open wound for lf or if its yet another tool in his arsenal of misdirectionsecond confirmed that cerceis ideaunderstanding of power is superficial rather too immediate and she herself is not skilled enough at the game to secure a position of power beyond something best described as fleetingtwo different methods of obtaining and harnessing power shown as mirror images on hbo rather well done in that regardwild speculationif lf is in renleys camp not in the novels and catelyn is headed to renleytrue to novel would dd be so bold as to actually have lf escort neds bones as a reason for them both to meet up face to face i mean would they deviate that dramatically thoughts"
"Skeksi",2012-04-08,"its possible i suppose but i would have thought that neds bones will either be sent back to the north with an escort or to robbs camp possibly with alton lannister rather than to renlys camp even if it is common knowledge that catelyn is there i think a more likely reason for littlefinger to end up in renlys camp is as the lannister negotiator to try and make a truce with renly who is probably one of the biggest threats they face due to his large army not to mention stannis and robb are obviously not going to make peace with them whilst catelyn is there to do the same for robb of course in the books littlefinger doesnt go to renlys war camp but it might be that they want to set up some scenes with littlefinger and the tyrells andor saw a good oppurtunity of having another scene with him and cat there are clearly some changes to the timeline but i would have thought lf will still largely play the same role as he did in the book of course it might be interesting to see the scenario you suggested too i guess well see in the next few episodes"
"Purah",2012-04-09,"it would be nice to see littlefingers interactions with the tyrells i dont think im alone here and his meeting with cat and subsequent rejection will force him to change his plans giving insight into the way he thrives on chaos taking opportunities on the fly"

"fauxkaren",2012-04-02,"i was rather dissatisfied with the way that catelyn was written in 2x01 and am not feeling too confident about the way that the show is handling the robb and cat portion of the story i mean i understand that this is an adaptation and that things have to change but im struggling with understanding why certain changes were necessary the following is adapated from something i wrote on tumblr but i thought it would be a good jumping off point for discussion really i think hbo just does not understand the robb and cat storyline it seems like the show is playing robb as hero completely straight i think part of that is a byproduct of aging up the character itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s kind of hard to sell richard madden as a boy king so in the books when robb pulls the grey wind stunt with cleos frey itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s immature posturing but in the show when he does it with jaime i think weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re supposed to read it as him being bad ass which completely misses the point of his character the point being robb as a deconstruction of the idea of a boy king but the way cat was handled was even worse there were four big mistakes with the way cat was written in 2x01 1 in the books it is catelyn who suggests to robb that they go to renly in order to try to get the baratheon brothers to work together to take down the lannisters i love that it is catelyn who has the political mind to see this solution the fact that in the show they gave that idea to robb does away with the idea we see in the books that while robb is a capable general on the battlefield he needs help ruling because hes not skilled in politics and diplomacy it also deemphasizes catelynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s perceptiveness and cleverness 2 i didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t really like the fact that the only reason cat gave for not sending theon to balon to treat was because balon was untrustworthy i mean that is true but in the books she relents and says that if robb has to treat with balon send someone else other than theon i think that in order for later events to be most impactful itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s important that she tell robb specifically to not send theon her opposition to sending theon also shows her wisdom theon is a hostage he is their leverage over balon why would you give up your leverage robb robb was letting his emotions and his affection for theon make his decisions for him so he ignored cats wisdom 3 i was annoyed that cat didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t get her line about girls not being worth it catelyn knows how the world works and she knows that in robbâ<U+0080><U+0099>s eyes his sisters arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t worth giving up his prize hostage of jaime lannister i mean i believe robb loves his sisters but he also doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want to risk angering his bannermen and they would be upset if he traded jaime for arya and sansa but with the line about girls not being worth it it becomes explicit that cat understands how the politics of it all is very gendered and how girls arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t worth much in this game of thrones and i think that is important to her character because shes a character who fulfills the gender roles of her society she likes being a wife and mother and is generally traditionally feminine but that doesnt prevent her from seeing how unfair her society is to women i mean i think we still got some of that it in the show but it could have been done better and more explicitly 4 and finally and most aggravatingly i was upset at her line about it being time for her to go home i mean in the book she does want to see bran and rickon but she knows that her duty right now is with robb so her wish to see bran and rickon in the books is more of a â<U+0080><U+009C>i wish we were all safe in winterfellâ<U+0080><U+009D> or a â<U+0080><U+009C>i wish i could be in multiple places at onceâ<U+0080><U+009D> type thing in the book she makes a conscious choice to be with robb because she knows that he needs her more at that moment in time robb is trying to stage a rebellion after all while bran and rickon are far away from the fighting in the care of trusted guardians but robb is a typical teenager about it trying to assert his independence and wanting his mom out of the way so he tries to send her away to various places i feel like by changing things to have catelyn want to leave robb and be with bran and rickon itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s like the showrunners are validating all the catelyn critics who complain about what a terrible mother she is for abandoning bran and rickon which is just not true all of these things might seem like minor changes but there are specific shades of meaning and nuances and complexity in the original text that i think were lost in the adaptation to screen and i just dont understand why those changes were made the only reason i can see is that the writers dont fully understand catelyn as a character and subsequently those changes didnt seem like all that big of a deal but i guess that to me as someone who loves the character in the books those changes just really stood out to me and didnt sit well with me at all"
"Alexia",2012-04-03,"what the writers seem to be doing with catelyn is really upsetting me in the original text she was a pragmatic feudal lady with keen political insights whose less competent teenaged son pushed her aside and wanted her to go away and leave him alone a teenaged son who was portrayed as generally politically inept and whose chestthumping refusal to trade the kingslayer for his sisters enabled the red wedding a lannister power grab through sansa and a bolton power grab through a false arya the way that she has been adapted for the screen is frankly sexist she was a politically smart and ambitious woman who was ignored for merely being a woman while a young teen ruined their house through misplaced trust and naiveta she is hated by fans for well being a politically smart and ambitious woman who interferes with the male â<U+0080><U+009C>heroesâ<U+0080><U+009D> and points out their poor decisions instead of going back to her babies where she belongs so the way hbo decides to adapt her is to make robb recite her lines from the book that show political insight remove her from the table where the political decisions are being made and validate all the misogyny being directed her way by having this adapted character say that her place is back with her babies because of course thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s where a good woman belongs and should want to be in the books she was right in almost every call she made â<U+0080><U+0094> but her opinions are dismissed because she is a woman and robb is 1 a rebellious teen and 2 has embraced some of the ingrained sexism of his society and doesnt want his bannermen to see him taking advice from mom the commentary here which passes straight over the heads of a lot of fans is really genius if robb had listened to mommy house stark would not have been demolished the way it was and the writers chose to not only ignore that but to diminish the female character so as to pump up the male â<U+0080><U+0094> in a way that completely validates the misogyny targeting the character a good womanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s place is with her babies and not involved in politics â<U+0080><U+0093> in fact if sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s involved in politics at all it should be reluctantly but that also misses the point of the entire arc my honesttogod reaction was wtf are you doing hbo catelyns plotline deals heavily with themes of sexism after nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s execution she was calling for peace while the men around her chose war and devastated the north and the riverlands robb wanted her to go back to bran and rickon but she wanted to stay with him where the future of their family was being decided it was her idea to visit renly to attempt to make an alliance not robbâ<U+0080><U+0099>s she wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t entirely against sending an envoy to balon just not theon she wanted ned to go south to become robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s hand now sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s been downgraded one assumes that the reasons for it are threefold 1 to pump up robb and make him sexier to the audiences instead of portrying the tragic boy king in over his head that he actually was 2 to make her more palatable to audiences because a womanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s place is with her babies doncha know and 3 to amend cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s characterization as she gets the storyline of a son who has slipped her control instead congratulations on either completely missing the entire point of a character arc and plotline or demonstrating a stupendous level of sexism all while validating the misogyny that permeates this fandom edited by alexia 03 april 2012  0356 pm"

"seeyouintee",2012-04-03,"while i agree that the characters different i disagree with almost everything else you said robb probably did bring down the starks but it wasnt because he didnt trade jaime for sansa it was because he broke his engagement vow causing the red wedding after she tried to treat with renly she shouldve gone back to winterfel and tried to help bran and rickon she wouldve been the biggest political asset there where they were politically weakest robb actually made fairly good decisions except alienating the karstarks and breaking his vows edit catelyn is also not as good as you make her out i am not a cathater like most everybody else here but she was downright cruel to jon and later becomes obsessed with vengeance at the expense of her humanity edited by seeyouintee 03 april 2012  0641 pm"
"David Selig",2012-04-03,"yeah its quite a shame not only for the reasons alexia explained so well but also because imo michelle fairley is one of the best actors in the cast and would have done justice to a more complex character on the other hand the attempts to make cersei more multidimensional in the series often fall flat because lena headley is quite limited as an actress imo edited by david selig 15 april 2012  0622 am"

"fauxkaren",2012-04-03,"like i said above these are moot points should have if how was she to knowenough saidthe point is that she should have been listened to because she gave wise advice and the people who did not listen to her ended up dead that is the point cat gave good advice people didnt listen they died how is that unclear to show her wisdom she should have been listened to and it was the folly of other people to ignore herjaime wasnt liked until 3 books later and many people still dislike him he was the most hated character in the book for the first 2 books apples and oranges anyway as george had jaime commit one horrid act and then purposefully went about making him bend over backwards to show how different he was in book 3 cat doesnt go through any kind change until uncatyes it is comparing apples to oranges because was cat did was nowhere near as awful as was jaime did she didnt need to be redeemed because she did nothing for which she needed redemptionask george not me hes the one that writes that rickon needs his mother not me hes the one that writes rickon as being neglected and allowed to become a feral child as i wrote above i would think they should have adequate childcare there however george didnt write it that wayif cat could have been in two places at once she would have been there in a heartbeat but cat had to make a choice and she chose to stay with the fifteen year old who was fighting a war because he needed her the mostand nobody in westeros and most readers dont find it obvious that robb needs cat at allwow i am really not sure how one would arrive at that conclusion because it is obvious to me that robb doesnt really know what he is doing as a ruler he is a good general yes but he doesnt know how to manage his bannermen and he really is fighting an unwinnable war which is why catelyn makes the suggestion to treat with renly robb does need catelyns advice and he is foolish to not take it a fifteen year old not wanting his mom around is not concrete evidence that she shouldnt be around furthermore robbs bannermen not wanting her around doesnt mean she shouldnt be around westeros is a deeply sexist society that does not value the opinion of women but that doesnt mean that it is okagain you have to go to the source on this one of grrm and stop ascribing sexism to the reasons why cat is disliked it is pretty clearly not sexist in nature you keep giving examples of other characters that do bad things or make mistakes and thats true in asoiaf nobody is perfect and in this series everybody finds different characters to like and forgive however no point of view character other than perhaps cersei makes more decisions that lead to such bad results peoples reactions to cat are natural occurrences from the way she is written you can forgive anybody for anything you dont have to justify as many actions for other characters as you do for cat even in your defense here it was nothing but justification after justification for either poor action or poor result for every other pov character thats just not the case with plenty of simply good actions in betweenplease elaborate on the bad decisions that cat made that led to bad results she captured tyrion which did lead to bad results but those were bad results that were unforeseeable you cannot blame her for tywins over the top reaction she set jaime free but what bad results did that have the red wedding was already being planned both ned and robb just to name two characters made even worse decisions that led to even worse results cat is routinely unfairly singled outwe must have read different novels whenever she wasnt talking to robb and on her own she did things extremely narrowminded and basically is the cause of the entire conflictyes we really must have read different novels because in the novels i read there was no single cause of the conflict because the series is actually really great in its complexity and in showing that the political situation was so tenuous and entangled that everything was incredibly precarious and multiple people contributed to the start of the war and it cannot be pinned on any one person saying catelyn started the war is like saying the the assasination of franz ferdinand was the cause of world war i was it part of it yes but saying that that isolated incident cause the war is just completely wrong and ignores the larger context"

"fauxkaren",2012-04-03,"back to the original topic of the thread i wrote a post about how i believe the robb and catelyn storyline is being done a huge disservice by hbo the following is an edited version of that post really i think hbo just does not understand the robb and cat storyline theyâ<U+0080><U+0099>re playing robb as hero completely straight i think part of that is a byproduct of aging up the character itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s kind of hard to sell richard madden as a boy king so in the books when robb pulls the grey wind stunt with cleos frey itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s immature posturing but in the show when he does it with jaime i think weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re supposed to read it as him being bad ass which completely misses the point of his character the point being a deconstruction of the idea of a boy king but the way cat was handled was even worse there were four big mistakes with the way cat was written in the first episode of season 2 1 in the books it is catelyn who suggests to robb that they go to renly and get the baratheon brothers to work together to take down the lannisters i love that it is catelyn who has the political mind to see this solution the fact that in the show they gave that idea to robb does away with the idea we see in the books that while robb is a capable general on the battlefield he needs help ruling it also deemphasizes catelynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s perceptiveness and cleverness 2 i didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t really like the fact that the only reason cat gave for not sending theon to balon to treat was because balon was untrustworthy i mean that is true but in the books she relents and says that if robb has to treat with balon send someone else other than theon i think that in order for later events to be most impactful itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s important that she tell robb specifically not to send theon her opposition to sending theon also shows her wisdom theon is a hostage he is their leverage over balon why would you give up your leverage robb robb was letting his emotions and his affection for theon make his decisions for him except of course cat is the character who makes lots of bad and irrational decisions amirite 3 i was annoyed that cat didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t get her line about girls not being worth it catelyn knows how the world works and she knows that in robbâ<U+0080><U+0099>s eyes his sisters arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t worth giving up his prize hostage of jaime lannister i mean i believe robb loves his sisters but he also doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want to risk angering his bannermen and they would be mad if he traded jaime for arya and sansa but with the line about girls not being worth it it becomes explicit that cat understands how the politics of it all is very gendered and how girls arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t worth much in this game of thrones the idea of the sexism in westerosi society is shown through other female characters of cours but in my opinion its important that that perspective come from catelyn as well as figures like arya unlike arya catelyn does fit into the prescribed gender roles assigned to her she is happy being a wife and mother and has traditionally feminine qualities but that doesnt mean that she is blind to the unfair way that women are treated and valued in westeros she did get the general argument about sansa and arya being important to her but i really just missed that line where she gets to explicitly call westerosi society out on how little it values girls instead the scene read as cat merely wanting her family back which is definitely true too dont get me wrong i just missed that extra shade of meaning that the line about girls not being worth it adds 4 i was really angry at cats line about it being time for her to go home i mean in the book she does want to see bran and rickon but she knows that her duty right now is with robb so her wish to see bran and rickon in the books is more of a â<U+0080><U+009C>i wish we were all safe in winterfellâ<U+0080><U+009D> or a â<U+0080><U+009C>i wish i could be in multiple places at onceâ<U+0080><U+009D> type thing in the book she makes a conscious choice to be with robb because she knows that he needs her more at that moment in time but robb is a typical teenager about it eager to assert his independence from her and he tries to send her away to various places and i feel like by changing things to have catelyn want to leave robb and be with bran and rickon itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s like the showrunners are validating all the haters who complain about what a terrible mother she is for abandoning bran and rickon because no that is not true"

"Envie",2012-04-03,"its my belief they are portraying catelyn the way they are in the series to give an opposing strong but fallible mother figure in the two main opposing factionson one side you have cersei who also is being portrayed a little differently  with some strong qualities and some weaknesses some points that make you pity her and others that make you despise her this seems to be the theme they may be striving for with catelyn on the honorable side of the fence which clearly isnt the best choice eitherthe reason i feel theyre putting strong emphasis on the two strong willed mothers of house lannister and house stark is from thishbo season 2 full length special you win or you die if you watch the 22 minute long you win or you die full length special on the hbo site you get a really clear idea of how the houses and characters within the houses are portrayed for the series this may be very different from a book fans opinion of the portrayals but as emilia clarke says at one point in an interviewsome people hold a grudge some people dont  but the tension is always so high and you as the audience member can decide for yourselves who you think should or should not have the powerthey stress several times they being some of the actors and the producers that the story is full of strong women figures this is why i believe catelyns character was changed to a more likeable personality for the series"

"kephv",2012-04-03,"i think cerseis change is much more drastic but i really dont like any of the changes theyve made to any of the characters they seem to be trying to make everyone more likable by taking away some important character decision or changing part of their past eg cats wanting ned to go south with robert cat not telling jon it shouldve been him tyrion not taking part in tyshas rape cersei not ordering the children killed her reflecting on her sins etc joffery is obviously the exception of course instead of cersei ordering the children killed its joffery who did it  which doesnt matter because everyone already hates him for me this only takes away from what the characters rather than make them better and whose chestthumping refusal to trade the kingslayer for his sisters enabled the red weddingthe red wedding wouldve happened whether he traded jaime or not"

"fauxkaren",2012-04-03,"this im not sure i like all the hysteria im seeing already after one freaking episode its disappointing seeing people cry fowl over certain things because of one scene in one episode give it the whole season or at least a couple more episodes before whining peopleback to the op i dont like cat at all and i think the series is trying to make her more sympathetic to have more appeal to viewers not that that is a bad thing but keep in mind this is just an adaptation and changes will and have been made for the tv audienceits not just one episode though it started all the way back in the pilot cat is a really layered character and its just frustrating to see her simplified like this in order to make her more likable which is just annoying i dont think she needed to be made more likable shes plenty likable in the books"
"Bride of Winter",2012-04-03,"i agree  and i say this as someone who likes robb as much as cat its not so much that robb was a complete idiot but he was definitely in over his head and cat knew what she was doing but nobody listened to her and in making robb this hero not only are you losing the tragic boyking story of robb but also the strong and intelligent cat that we or at least some of us grew to love in the books so the way the producers are handling cat and robb both sides lose imo or at least those of us who read the books and know what were missing the tv audience is probably eating this crap up"

"Envie",2012-04-03,"well i think the vast difference between jaime and catelyn makes it a little hard to justify an equal like or dislike they are so totally different jaime ends up being a favorite because of his change of heart and a sense of honor he learns through brienne catelyns so polar opposite to that and becomes a zombie which for many people just kinda ruined it did for me anyways how can anyone compare the two characters"
"Greatjon_umber",2012-04-03,"what the writers seem to be doing with catelyn is really upsetting me in the original text she was a pragmatic feudal lady with keen political insights whose less competent teenaged son pushed her aside and wanted her to go away and leave him alone a teenaged son who was portrayed as generally politically inept and whose chestthumping refusal to trade the kingslayer for his sisters enabled the red wedding a lannister power grab through sansa and a bolton power grab through a false aryathe way that she has been adapted for the screen is frankly sexist she was a politically smart and ambitious woman who was ignored for merely being a woman while a young teen ruined their house through misplaced trust and naiveta she is hated by fans for well being a politically smart and ambitious woman who interferes with the male â<U+0080><U+009C>heroesâ<U+0080><U+009D> and points out their poor decisions instead of going back to her babies where she belongsso the way hbo decides to adapt her is to make robb recite her lines from the book that show political insight remove her from the table where the political decisions are being made and validate all the misogyny being directed her way by having this adapted character say that her place is back with her babies because of course thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s where a good woman belongs and should want to bein the books she was right in almost every call she made â<U+0080><U+0094> but her opinions are dismissed because she is a woman and robb is 1 a rebellious teen and 2 has embraced some of the ingrained sexism of his society and doesnt want his bannermen to see him taking advice from mom the commentary here which passes straight over the heads of a lot of fans is really genius if robb had listened to mommy house stark would not have been demolished the way it wasand the writers chose to not only ignore that but to diminish the female character so as to pump up the male â<U+0080><U+0094> in a way that completely validates the misogyny targeting the character a good womanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s place is with her babies and not involved in politics â<U+0080><U+0093> in fact if sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s involved in politics at all it should be reluctantly but that also misses the point of the entire arc my honesttogod reaction was wtf are you doing hbocatelyns plotline deals heavily with themes of sexism after nedâ<U+0080><U+0099>s execution she was calling for peace while the men around her chose war and devastated the north and the riverlands robb wanted her to go back to bran and rickon but she wanted to stay with him where the future of their family was being decided it was her idea to visit renly to attempt to make an alliance not robbâ<U+0080><U+0099>s she wasnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t entirely against sending an envoy to balon just not theon she wanted ned to go south to become robertâ<U+0080><U+0099>s handnow sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s been downgraded one assumes that the reasons for it are threefold 1 to pump up robb and make him sexier to the audiences instead of portrying the tragic boy king in over his head that he actually was 2 to make her more palatable to audiences because a womanâ<U+0080><U+0099>s place is with her babies doncha know and 3 to amend cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s characterization as she gets the storyline of a son who has slipped her control insteadcongratulations on either completely missing the entire point of a character arc and plotline or demonstrating a stupendous level of sexism all while validating the misogyny that permeates this fandomi said it to myself when i was reading acok and ill say it again robb would have been better off without catelyn standing over his shoulder would things have turned out better or worse im not grrm so i cant say however catelyn really never proves her worth as this shrewd diplomat a lot of people are trying to make her out to be one person has said it over and over again shoulda woulda coulda but didnt what ifs are useless and no way a general and the only heir to casterly rock as far as i know pretty sure tyrion wasnt going to inherit is a fair trade for two young girls with absolutely zero political or military prowess im sorry im a huge fan of the stark family and id have loved to see the two girls returned to winterfell where they belong but robb was absolutely right two useless girls are not worth the exchange of a man who could potentially lead armies and has proven himself one of the best swordsmen westeros has to offer not to mention all the northmen that died trying to claim him as a prisoner and the treating with renly how can you even try to justify it it didnt work catelyn tried and it just didnt work even if renly had been murdered his terms were clear and although i saw his terms as fair i dont believe the north would and whats all this bull about the war being unwinnable the war was winnable up until the red wedding and ill be glad to argue with whoever wants to prove me otherwise in a brand new post since itd be difficult to argue points not made yet what else has catelyn done to prove her worth as an advisor to robb not sending theon sending theon or not balons intentions were the same however sending theon made it possible for winterfell to be taken but at the same time theon was robbs brother not in blood nor in name but they were raised together for what was it 9 years robb was a young lad inexperienced in pretty much everything he came across and acted as best he could to make his father and his family proud and the starks arent doomed robb nor catelyn doomed the stark family two members of the stark family died just two i dont consider catelyn a real member because shes a tully some northern bannermen died as well but only two full blooded starks died theres still plenty lurking around really i dont dislike catelyn at all i can understand her motives and shes maybe not as politically inept as eddard was but none the less none of her choices would have spared the north or her son please tell me one piece of advice she gave that could have saved her son or ended the war renly wasnt going to treat atleast not with the terms robb and the north were looking for stannis even less likely to treat on those terms the lannisters the family that killed their lord father and holds robbs siblings ransom of course he cant make peace with them not until his family was avenged and the lannisters made to pay for their crimes what really gets me though is all this crying about sexism get off that people can choose to like or dislike characters for whatever reason they want rather it be because they dont like their appearance their attitude their deeds or even the places they come from you dont get to simply yell sexism because youre a woman and people dont like your favorite character get over it catelyn wasnt some savior that could have spared the north or robb she was just another player in the game of thrones and not a very good one at that edited by greatjonumber 03 april 2012  0944 pm"

"Lord Belmore",2012-04-04,"i partially agree with you and partially disagree with youbook catelyn was one of my favorite characters in the series was because whatever one thinks of lady stoneheart shes not nearly the same character as catelyn when she lived and i think the show has done her a disservice  do i think its sexism im not sure they diminished littlefinger this episode for cerseis benefit im not ready to call sexism in this circumstance as there remain some very reasonable alternative explanations for each move i will say that in the absence of catelyn the story lacks a really admirable female lead daenerys has annoyed me as an angry unbelievable trope and while i like cersei because i have a cheer for the villain tendency ill never make the argument that shes particularly admirable tragic perhaps but she hasnt dealt with her tragedies nearly so admirably as catelyn hashowever i think youre painting an extreme partial painting of the characters to try and make your pointrobb wasnt a hack child in over his head like joffrey was we have to remember he was a 15year old in the books he had listened to his mother a few prudent times catelyn herself noted happiness at his learning and development at times and he fared better than one may have expected of him for quite awhile he was making the powerful and capable tywin look the fool prior to the greyjoy bolton and frey debacles strategically and militarily but indeed for all of his good qualities you righly mention some flaws some combination of his age and his heart brought about his failing he was too trusting of some wrong people and he made a bullheaded move with jeyne westerling i wouldnt say he was simply in over his head though or whitewash his redeeming qualitiesof which there were many like ned and as ill soon say like catelyn he was a good and in his case more surprisingly good given the age capable individual with a tragic flaw or two which so happened in his unfortunate circumstances to destroy himbook catelyn to me was very much as you describe her she gave some very sound advice she balanced these with what were unequal familial duties for a westerosi woman but i dont think she was meant to be perfection weighed down by a brutish warhawk of a son like robb she made her trust mistake but hers was with littlefinger and resulted in a fiasco with tyrion and while i even agree with you that her advice to trade jaime for sansaarya was good doing so as she did was an incredible risk motivated out of what was in her unfortunate circumstances a tragic flaw in concern for her family like robb she made her mistakes in the end it results in a very strong understandable character operating in a world made for the plotting of the lannisters rather than the heart of the starksrobb and catelyn were two sides of the same coin more so than ive seen anyone willing to admit i thought they were both likable capable characters with good qualities which in their circumstances and in a cruel world resulted instead in tragedy and for my part of the two i did prefer catelyn catelyn has my vote for the single most realistically strong character in the series along with all of the nuance such a realistic character in such an extreme world entails while the hbo series is somewhat disappointing me in their portrayal of catelyn michelle fairley is still doing a wonderful enough job that i still really enjoy hereven in this somewhat neutered so to speak form due to the difficulty of an adapation im unconvinced as yet to assert utter sexism for the change for similar things like the littlefingercersei parallel mentioned above though i do see some sliver of it in that catelyn retained all of her emotional and motherly power while losing some of her more intellectual qualities however robb has been portrayed very similarly and emotionally so im unwilling to make too much of that its also a little quick to judge in my book her advice against sending theon remained her treatment with the freys remained renly is yet to come she hasnt lost out on too much and everyone loses something of their character simply due to the difference in mediums of storytelling to this point and i think one has to give robb a very unfair analysis to make the opposite argumenti dont like the change any more than i do the change to littlefinger in the episode catelyn and littlefinger probably being my favorite characters in the series but i can in both cases understand them right now i think too harsh of a condemnation of the still rather minor changes is reactionary and misrepresenting parts of the novel and its misrepresenting the intentions of the adapters edited by lord belmore 04 april 2012  0109 am"
"Vikingkingq",2012-04-04,"while i agree with the ops argument that catelyns political acumen has been diminished in this scene i do think that pumping up robb is necessaryin the books robb is much less mature and franklya little dim this is ok in the book because were seeing everything through catelyns eyes but in the show were not we have to care when the scarlet reception happens and were not going to be inside catelyns head when it happens we have to care about robb stark we have to root for him to win  we have to invest the same feelings we had towards eddard stark so that when the scarlet reception happens it hits just like the sept of baelor scene in episode 9so i like the change to robb it really annoyed me on rereading game of thrones how often robb stark waves around his sword while everyone looks at him like hes a moron how he needs to be walked through what happened with the attempted assassination how he sits wringing his hands and needs his mommy to work him through the strategy of his first battle in the show hes 3 years older  if he acts the same way as a 17 year old that his 14year old equivalent did no one would sympathize with him at all the character changed  hes more sure of himself when hes dealing with greatjon umber he has a battleplan ready and he knows something about politicsat the same time it pisses me off that theyve given catelyn the shortshrift which they did since the pilot when they completely reversed her position on ned taking the hand although i think they did recover in her tent scenes with robb in episodes 910 when she was advising robb without rolling over himi do think it was possible for them to have made more of a balance  give catelyn some of the points while still giving robb credit for a political strategy you could have robb tell her i need you to go to renly and she could rejoin im supposed to bring back his 100000 swords am i and robb responds between the two of us i think we can force a peace its more of a conversation of equals i do have more hope for when shes off on her own negotiating with renly in what i think is going to be episodes 34"
"imrastro",2012-04-04,"im also finding this thread depressing as i do all the cat threads some reasders like greatjonumber twist the text and their logic to diminish and simplify an extremely complex and nuanced character dont sweat it alexia youve read to greater depth but youll never convince people incapable of changing their emotional reaction and bias even in the facr of the authors text"
"Qhorin Halfhand and Yoren",2012-04-04,"while i agree with you they are making catelyns character worse in favor of robb and also to the detriments of some of the themes of the story i just really like tv show robb and he was one of the characters in the book that i also would have liked if i had to know him more in the books i understand where you are coming from but i am enjoying immensely the robb scenes and the rebel somewhat smarter robb also when they change the story a little while the story they change remains good i dont mind as it seems somewhat fresh i can mind it if i think the result is quite worse story than a far closer adaptation so i think the result of these changes is still good television and it is something different i still have the books for the superior catelyn characterization so i dont mind it if the tv show makes robb better smarter at her expense of course i understand not everyone will agree and that is understandable for several people to be against these changes as i do think that book catelyn is a better character and some might also not like the change of robbs character while i enjoy them note that tv show catelyn character is not a bad character even with the changes also book catelyn is right to not be at winterfell and be at robbs side she pretty much shows to be a rather intelligent in politics and intelligent in general the sexism themes are also important in her story as a woman who wants correctly peace at important points gives valid advice is not listened to wants to trade her daughters for jaime and says how girls are not important in westeros society she is sort of a casandra figure though she is also does make mistakes as well and like most grrm characters she has her flaws and is not perfect her treatment of jon snow for example as for how grrm has written her he has written her to be a sympathetic and tragic figure with a flaw that readers will probably not like but forgive considering how most other characters have much more important flaws and then as uncat she is an antagonistic and tragic figure edited by qhorin halfhand and yoren 04 april 2012  0142 am"

"Nymeria Star-Eyes",2012-04-04,"for me the issue here isnt book integrity or the costbenefit analysis of every single one of cats decisions and opinions its about one of the major themes of all the asoiaf books perhaps the major theme peace is always better than wargrrm was a conscientious objector during the vietnam war in asoiaf none of the wars are righteous and both sides always lose in the war of five kings roberts rebellion even the blackfyre rebellion and danys conquests in the east no character is portrayed on the good side and no one is on the bad side i include dany because though grrm is clear that liberating the slaves is a good thing her actions have horrific repercussions all the same the point that grrm makes over and over again is that all wars are terrible and they should be avoided at all costs the small folk suffer the kings suffer their mother and fathers suffer their siblings suffer war is not glorious knights fighting in shining armor as bran and sansa and arya and brienne and renly etc etc want to believe war is bodies rotting on the side of the road women raped children cut open corpses hanging from trees grrm is extremely explicit in his descriptions of the horrors of war grrm in no way portrays robb as a glorified king going to avenge his father because that is the righteous thing to do just as he doesnt portray joffrey defending his throne as the glorified righteous kingso where does cat come into this robb sees himself as the righteous hero and cat is the only person to tell him that war isnt like that cat questions how eager he is to jump to violence when she shows him the dagger in the godswood she questions his decision to go to war urging peace after he is declared king in the north when edmure asks her about revenge she says that it will not bring ned back to her because its true the war will not bring anyone back to life it only brings more deathso when cat hugs robb and says we will kill them all im upset yeah the line sounds awesome it makes us want to root for them but that is exactly the reason grrm portrays war as he does he wants us to take a step back and say wait why does that sound awesome theyre talking about killing people just as grrm makes the reader question stereotypes about true knights with sansas arc he makes the reader question stereotypes about the value of violence win robbs arc robbs story is about peace because its not robbs story its catelynswhen hbo takes the character of robb whose theme is an example of how revenge is always wrong even if the intentions are good and turns him into some glorified honorable sympathetic character i look at the screen and say what are you doingbecause were not supposed to sympathize with robb grrm doesnt want us to sympathize with characters that encourage violence thats why catelyns pov is catelyns grrm is forcing the reader to question our eagerness to go to war and kill our enemies because its never the best solution cat suggests diplomacy cat suggests peace cat denies revenge because she understands that in the end its worthless and no one listens to her just like hbo isnt listening to her thats why robbs arc is tragic the red wedding is tragic already we dont have to change the fundamental message of the story to manipulate the viewers feelingsi dont care about this because oh no its not exactly like the books the sky is falling i care about this because fictional narratives matter the way we present them in our media matters the values that our shows and books encourage matters we absorb the ideals that entertainment gives us we have violence in our own world children are murdered women are raped families suffer war happens over and over again should we glorify these horrors too im definitely not saying that anyone here is a killer or a rapist or anything of the sort but if your first reaction to a line like we will kill them all is thats awesome maybe you should take a minure to ask yourself why you have that reaction i mean if we never decide that violence is the worst option as a society its gonna keep being the go to option of course one tv show or one book series isnt going to change our culture but if one extremely popular franchise decides to say no were gonna show war in a different way an accurate way and it works like it worked in the books its a step in the right direction baby steps guysgrrm was opposed to war in the real world just as hes opposed to war in fiction when hbo changes the narrative to make robb the good guy â<U+0084> and his war the good fight â<U+0084> theyre being unfaithful to the underlying point of grrms story when you title an episode as the north remembers a phrase that doesnt even become relevant for about two books youre taking the theme of vengeance applying it to a situation where it really shouldnt be applied and saying come on guys root for these characters because theyre gonna go kill the bad guys â<U+0099> remember when ned died yeah that just happened theyre trying really hard this season to be show the antagonists as morally grey rather than evil which i really appreciate and am really happy with but it just might be more effective if you didnt have to put the lannisters baby killers and whores up against the starks paragons of honor and justice here to save the daymaybe as the season progresses we will see cat acting more like cat and robb as less of a glorified king but based on the 11 episodes weve already seen im not sure thats the direction this is going edited by nymeria stareyes 04 april 2012  0152 am"

"fauxkaren",2012-04-04,"nymeria stareyes that is an excellent post and you should feel goodone of the reason that part of the story is told by cat and not robb is that she has already lived through a war she knows what war is and she knows the cost of it she knows the futility and pointlessness of it without her perspective the story becomes an entire different thing if the story had been told from robbs pov we would have seen war through the eyes of a 15 year old boy who really knows nothing of the harsh realities of it the war would have been more glorified and the focus would probably have been on justice of his causeby changing catelyn hbo is erasing that integral part of the story"

"mareeana",2012-04-04,"yeah i just need to add my voice to this topic i completely agree with the op and the problem here as has already been said is twofold firstly theyre stripping away most of catelyns characters traits and this is based on 11 episodes not 10 minutes presumably as people are saying to make her more likable and thats bs and its giving in to every criticism this fandom has ever made of her character criticisms deeply rooted in sexism btw and thats problematic in itself not just because shes my favorite and id like to see them getting her right in the adaptation but also because of the already mentioned sexist nature of those criticisms the show is telling everyone who has always hated cat for these reasons yes you were right lets change everything to appease all the stupid things youve ever said because you didnt actually bother to readsecondly its missing the whole point as nymeria stareyes said grrm didnt accidentally make catelyn the pov character for robbs story he wanted it told through her eyes robbs arc is one of a boy in over his head catelyns is one of a politically savvy adviser who has good ideas and who is sidelined because of her gender and because shes the kings mother and who ends up being right in the end though it doesnt do her any good at all the fact that hbo is dumbing this down because it thinks its audience cant handle anything more complex than your usual tragic boy hero story though they might be right is not to be celebrated to be honest if thats the story they wanted to tell they should be adapting different books"

"Vikingkingq",2012-04-04,"i find myself coming down somewhere between these two positions and personally i think robb and catelyn are actually fairly evenly balanced to me catelyns decision to let jaime go parallels robbs decision to let theon go with a slight tinge of him marrying jayne westerling whereas her seizure of tyrion mirrors his decision not to tell edmure about his plans to lure tywin in between their two armies in the first case both of them let go a valuable hostage without any way to follow through that their exchange would work yes sansa was valuable as a marriage piece but catelyn didnt get anyone else to sign off on her plan which lead to robb losing the karstarks and she had no guarantees that the lannisters would honor their side of the agreement once jaime was free similarly robbs plan had merit but he put the cart before the horse in giving up the hostage before the agreement was reached in the second both of them made a strategic gamble which had merit and some success but their failure to communicate with their allies meant that they couldnt have followed through with their plan im spoiling some stuff i was going to argue in my blog but catelyns mistake wasnt in seizing tyrion after all she had every reason to believe that he was involved in a conspiracy against her sons life but in how she surrendered control of him to her crazy sister and didnt really communicate with either riverrun or kings landing about ways to make use of her captive like ned issuing a warrant for tyrions arrest which would have made tywins actions in the riverlands open treason likewise robbs plan to trap and destroy tywin between two armies was sound but his failure to let edmure know what he was doing meant that the plan only halfsucceeded now ill argue on my blog that he still would have been in a favorable position overall had he either listened to his mother about theon or if she hadnt let jaime go but i think portraying robb as a wellmeaning incompetant misses the larger picture regarding grrms themes  yes its true that he chose catelyn for a reason although i will note that hes said postseason 1 that theyve made robb into a more interesting character that he would have liked to do a pov for however its a literary reason not a cinematic one remember how people complained about not being able to see the battle of the whispering woods now imagine an entire season of hearing about war it might be very rich in character although it creates huge obstacles for avoiding show dont tell while bringing out catelyns interiority but it would be cinematically unbearable  ten hours of waiting for godot so we need to see robb to get that side of the war and in order for us to enjoy that storyline we need something more than an immature boy that at best people are feeling sorry for keep in mind we arent going to experience the scarlet reception through catelyns eyes with all her wrenching stream of consciousness what benioff and weiss are going for is a repeat of their headfake with ned theyre building up another tragic hero and then theyre going to cut him down and the viewers are going to care because theyve invested emotionally in a character who doesnt come off as a bit of a thickie regarding war as a theme i think people are right that grrm was a conscientious objector whos making an argument that war has no winners however hes not just saying that grrm has also spoken very movingly about the strategy of war the intellect behind it the glamor of it i think hes also been quite critical of the idea that unthinking pacifism is any better than unthinking militarism  all lommy gets for his yielding is a spear in the throat lysas isolationism is shown as self destructive selfishness and catelyns desires to go home to winterfell and shut the world out arent realistic she doesnt think about what happens when robb gives up the war and goes home leaving the lannisters in complete control of the south we know theyre not going to let robb alone even if tywins willing to let his enemies off their knees neither balon nor cersei are and at the end of the day the others have to be fought edited by vikingkingq 04 april 2012  0549 am"
"The Black Wolf",2012-04-04,"and what pray tell would you have done differentlyim not saying that im better at politics than catelyn but im sure people like lf and perhaps kevan lannister would have been better at negotiating with renly again im not saying cat is stupid but i dont think shes as politically competent as some would have her behahahaha there we have it folks the blatant doublestandard just a few lines apart awesomeactually i think you missed the point here i was pointing out that if you cant blame cat for not foreseeing the red wedding then you cant really blame robb for trusting theon personally i think they both made bad choices there but thats easy to say now in hindsight and if you walked around not trusting anyone youd end up like cersei about her trusting lf again its easy to say now that she shouldnt have done it and i understand why she did it and it shows that she in fact isnt the best judge of character or the incredibly politically shrewd character that some seem to think she is there is a lot of middle ground between being ned and being lf or varys catelyn is better than ned at politics but that doesnt make her brilliant at least thats my opinion"
"Milcov",2012-04-04,"the theon and renly ones did sort of annoy me im far from a fan of catelyn but the theon comment specifically shows her as having a good understanding of the political situation the starks are in"
"nara",2012-04-04,"i was rather dissatisfied with the way that catelyn was written in 2x01 and am not feeling too confident about the way that the show is handling the robb and cat portion of the story i mean i understand that this is an adaptation and that things have to change but im struggling with understanding why certain changes were necessary the following is adapated from something i wrote on tumblr but i thought it would be a good jumping off point for discussionreally i think hbo just does not understand the robb and cat storyline it seems like the show is playing robb as hero completely straight i think part of that is a byproduct of aging up the character itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s kind of hard to sell richard madden as a boy king so in the books when robb pulls the grey wind stunt with cleos frey itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s immature posturing but in the show when he does it with jaime i think weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re supposed to read it as him being bad ass which completely misses the point of his character the point being robb as a deconstruction of the idea of a boy kingbut the way cat was handled was even worse there were four big mistakes with the way cat was written in 2x011 in the books it is catelyn who suggests to robb that they go to renly in order to try to get the baratheon brothers to work together to take down the lannisters i love that it is catelyn who has the political mind to see this solution the fact that in the show they gave that idea to robb does away with the idea we see in the books that while robb is a capable general on the battlefield he needs help ruling because hes not skilled in politics and diplomacy it also deemphasizes catelynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s perceptiveness and cleverness2 i didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t really like the fact that the only reason cat gave for not sending theon to balon to treat was because balon was untrustworthy i mean that is true but in the books she relents and says that if robb has to treat with balon send someone else other than theon i think that in order for later events to be most impactful itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s important that she tell robb specifically to not send theon her opposition to sending theon also shows her wisdom theon is a hostage he is their leverage over balon why would you give up your leverage robb robb was letting his emotions and his affection for theon make his decisions for him so he ignored cats wisdom3 i was annoyed that cat didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t get her line about girls not being worth it catelyn knows how the world works and she knows that in robbâ<U+0080><U+0099>s eyes his sisters arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t worth giving up his prize hostage of jaime lannister i mean i believe robb loves his sisters but he also doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want to risk angering his bannermen and they would be upset if he traded jaime for arya and sansa but with the line about girls not being worth it it becomes explicit that cat understands how the politics of it all is very gendered and how girls arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t worth much in this game of thrones and i think that is important to her character because shes a character who fulfills the gender roles of her society she likes being a wife and mother and is generally traditionally feminine but that doesnt prevent her from seeing how unfair her society is to women i mean i think we still got some of that it in the show but it could have been done better and more explicitly4 and finally and most aggravatingly i was upset at her line about it being time for her to go home i mean in the book she does want to see bran and rickon but she knows that her duty right now is with robb so her wish to see bran and rickon in the books is more of a â<U+0080><U+009C>i wish we were all safe in winterfellâ<U+0080><U+009D> or a â<U+0080><U+009C>i wish i could be in multiple places at onceâ<U+0080><U+009D> type thing in the book she makes a conscious choice to be with robb because she knows that he needs her more at that moment in time robb is trying to stage a rebellion after all while bran and rickon are far away from the fighting in the care of trusted guardians but robb is a typical teenager about it trying to assert his independence and wanting his mom out of the way so he tries to send her away to various places i feel like by changing things to have catelyn want to leave robb and be with bran and rickon itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s like the showrunners are validating all the catelyn critics who complain about what a terrible mother she is for abandoning bran and rickon which is just not trueall of these things might seem like minor changes but there are specific shades of meaning and nuances and complexity in the original text that i think were lost in the adaptation to screen and i just dont understand why those changes were made the only reason i can see is that the writers dont fully understand catelyn as a character and subsequently those changes didnt seem like all that big of a deal but i guess that to me as someone who loves the character in the books those changes just really stood out to me and didnt sit well with me at allagree completely catelyn is shrewd when it comes to this political stuff but emotional in her hatred of jon and trust in petyr the dichotomy is important for her character the producers are sacrificng her to play up robb and thats not cool"
"Areo Speedwagon",2012-04-04,"i think nymeria star eyes and vikingkingq have been the most reasonable and introspective on this thread so farill start by saying that a book is a book a tv show is a tv show and a movie is a movie tv shows are not books and books and not movies and tv shows are not movies it sounds ridiculous and redundant but i think it needs to be reiterated to more than a few people on this thread i think many people on this thread are truly underestimating the visual component in telling this story through the medium of television and the limits of television itself its why catelyn didnt tell jon it should have been you in regards to bran getting pushed out the window without knowing her internal monologue the intricacies of her and neds relationship the complexity of the gender roles of westeros audience members would instantly write her off as cold and unsympathetic forever that one line would have colored your perception of her for the rest of the series simply because you saw her say it and you saw jons face react to it so we cannot compare robb from the books to robb from the show because a book is not a tv show and we cant keep calling robb from the tv show a boy king in the same way we call robb from the books a boy king they are at least 6 years apart and i think benioff and weiss were right in making everyone older in my opinion it would have been ridiculous to watch a 15 boy tell the greatjon surely he only meant to cut my meat and to see a 15 year old rise as again the greatjon says theres the only king i mean to bend my knee to and i think it would have called jaimes competence into question to see a 15 year old riding out of the whispering wood with jaime in tow i teach 15 year olds i think the showrunners made the right callas to the robbcatelyn characterizations again it has to do with the limits of television and my initial point i think hbo is really playing up robb as the general who won every battle but lost the war by making many of catelyns suggestions and ideas robbs i think hbo is really leading us directly to the red wedding to fauxkrakens original point 2 i think youre right in that it would have a big impact to have catelyn advise against sending theon and it does show her wisdom but then you say it in your very next sentence robb was letting his emotions and his affection for theon make his decisions for him this emotional decision making is exactly why he marries jeyne westerling which is exactly what gets him and his mother killed won every battle but lost everything i think robb sending theon out of brotherly love is setting him up as one who while a calculating brilliant tactician on the battlefield he very much acts on emotion off the battlefield and hence this will make his betrothal to jeyne more in characteras to the cuts it has been mentioned many times but the one that sticks out is someone up thread saying they didnt even include catelyn in the king in the north scene in season 1 if martin wants to write something anything he is perfectly free to do so he can add another 100 200 pages of dialogue stream of conscious or whatever he wants without consequence tv shows dont have that luxury again i know that is redundant but it seems to need to be said benioff and weiss only have roughly 55 minutes to cover between 100  250 pages of text and they arent just adapting the chapter or the book theyre adapting a song of ice and fire i remember an interview with peter jackson about adapting lord of the rings and he said roughly i dont have the quote in front of me we started with the goal of the story frodo destroying the ring everything in the movies needs to support that end if it doesnt it got cut then we worked our way backwards i think benioff and weiss having the benefit of knowing where martin is going with this are taking the same approach this is a story about in its broadest sense a supernatural perhaps even cosmic battle between a foe that has been laying dormant for 8000 years and magical creatures that were thought to have gone extinct returning do the complexities of gender roles in the world in which this battle is taking place add to the story absolutely you would be a fool to say otherwise if you personally had the task of parsing down what will probably be roughly 10000 pages or text into what will probably be roughly 70 or 80 hours of television what priority would you assign the complexities of gender roles in a world governed by magic that includes dragons krakens sorceresses ice demons zombies hodor esp roose bolton exiled princesses maltreated bastards the faceless men and the nights watch among many many others i understand that is a completely subjective question but if answered honestly there is really one answer however thats not to say they arent dealing with gender roles they just arent talking about it the very fact that this thread exists proves that there are perceived inequities in gender i think the changes benioff and weiss have made have been to push the complexities of gender roles into the subtext which in my opinion was wise its not what you notice upon your first viewing but if you watch again or with that issue in mind you will see that catelyn cersei danaerys and others are treated very much the lesser than their male counterparts theyre just not ruminating on it because obviously were not inside their heads if you notice it will it add to the story of course if you dont notice it and just tune in for the ice zombies and dragons is it going to spoil that no i am very curious to see brienne though as i think all this subtext will be forced to become text and maybe we will have characters actually talking about it"
"Vikingkingq",2012-04-04,"oh and fyi im pretty sure that catelyns line about the girls not being worth it shows up later in the season because i have a strong memory of seeing it in some promo video edit also i think the promo for next week that shows jorah saying they dont like the idea of a woman leading a khalassar and dany responding theyll like it a lot less when im done with them suggests than benioff and weiss havent forgotten the theme of gender and leadership edited by vikingkingq 04 april 2012  0315 pm"

"wolverine",2012-04-05,"i was rather dissatisfied with the way that catelyn was written in 2x01 and am not feeling too confident about the way that the show is handling the robb and cat portion of the story i mean i understand that this is an adaptation and that things have to change but im struggling with understanding why certain changes were necessary the following is adapated from something i wrote on tumblr but i thought it would be a good jumping off point for discussionreally i think hbo just does not understand the robb and cat storyline it seems like the show is playing robb as hero completely straight i think part of that is a byproduct of aging up the character itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s kind of hard to sell richard madden as a boy king so in the books when robb pulls the grey wind stunt with cleos frey itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s immature posturing but in the show when he does it with jaime i think weâ<U+0080><U+0099>re supposed to read it as him being bad ass which completely misses the point of his character the point being robb as a deconstruction of the idea of a boy kingbut the way cat was handled was even worse there were four big mistakes with the way cat was written in 2x011 in the books it is catelyn who suggests to robb that they go to renly in order to try to get the baratheon brothers to work together to take down the lannisters i love that it is catelyn who has the political mind to see this solution the fact that in the show they gave that idea to robb does away with the idea we see in the books that while robb is a capable general on the battlefield he needs help ruling because hes not skilled in politics and diplomacy it also deemphasizes catelynâ<U+0080><U+0099>s perceptiveness and cleverness2 i didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t really like the fact that the only reason cat gave for not sending theon to balon to treat was because balon was untrustworthy i mean that is true but in the books she relents and says that if robb has to treat with balon send someone else other than theon i think that in order for later events to be most impactful itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s important that she tell robb specifically to not send theon her opposition to sending theon also shows her wisdom theon is a hostage he is their leverage over balon why would you give up your leverage robb robb was letting his emotions and his affection for theon make his decisions for him so he ignored cats wisdom3 i was annoyed that cat didnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t get her line about girls not being worth it catelyn knows how the world works and she knows that in robbâ<U+0080><U+0099>s eyes his sisters arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t worth giving up his prize hostage of jaime lannister i mean i believe robb loves his sisters but he also doesnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t want to risk angering his bannermen and they would be upset if he traded jaime for arya and sansa but with the line about girls not being worth it it becomes explicit that cat understands how the politics of it all is very gendered and how girls arenâ<U+0080><U+0099>t worth much in this game of thrones and i think that is important to her character because shes a character who fulfills the gender roles of her society she likes being a wife and mother and is generally traditionally feminine but that doesnt prevent her from seeing how unfair her society is to women i mean i think we still got some of that it in the show but it could have been done better and more explicitly4 and finally and most aggravatingly i was upset at her line about it being time for her to go home i mean in the book she does want to see bran and rickon but she knows that her duty right now is with robb so her wish to see bran and rickon in the books is more of a â<U+0080><U+009C>i wish we were all safe in winterfellâ<U+0080><U+009D> or a â<U+0080><U+009C>i wish i could be in multiple places at onceâ<U+0080><U+009D> type thing in the book she makes a conscious choice to be with robb because she knows that he needs her more at that moment in time robb is trying to stage a rebellion after all while bran and rickon are far away from the fighting in the care of trusted guardians but robb is a typical teenager about it trying to assert his independence and wanting his mom out of the way so he tries to send her away to various places i feel like by changing things to have catelyn want to leave robb and be with bran and rickon itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s like the showrunners are validating all the catelyn critics who complain about what a terrible mother she is for abandoning bran and rickon which is just not trueall of these things might seem like minor changes but there are specific shades of meaning and nuances and complexity in the original text that i think were lost in the adaptation to screen and i just dont understand why those changes were made the only reason i can see is that the writers dont fully understand catelyn as a character and subsequently those changes didnt seem like all that big of a deal but i guess that to me as someone who loves the character in the books those changes just really stood out to me and didnt sit well with me at allsoyou think cat is awesome and hbo is making her look less awesomei hated her from the books and actually like her on the show"

"Brewmaster",2012-04-05,"the point that cats most ardent supporters seem to overlook is that its simply human nature to read and respond to things in a certain manner i am not a cat hater from the book but shes not my favorite and i did need a second read to get to the point where i understood her better when i say that cats actions need rationalizing more so than other characters im not even speaking about the deeds themselves necessarily but how the books are written for example when i point out that its only natural for readers to dislike cat because of her issues with jon and the capture of tyrion early on in the book among the defenses of cat in this thread are that we only know that cat is making a mistake with tyrion because we have information from other povs that cat lacks well thats true but it completely misses the point we do have that information and you cant take it away from us i get what cats supporters think but it takes a deeper level of reading into the story than is natural for most people to do readers arent going to operate under the assumption that they dont know whats going on nobody reads like that this is not about misogyny this is about human nature and its natural for people to have negative reactions to characters that do wrong to other characters they like its also pretty much human nature to root for the underdog jon as a bastard with little status is seen as an underdog early on tyrion definitely the same its also human nature to pick sides cat is both set up against jon and against tyrion early on its also human nature that first impressions are hard to overcome yes jaime overcomes his for many readersit takes a lot of character change for that to overcome that impression as the cat supporters will tell you cat doesnt change nor should she since she doesnt even have anything to apologize for that is a lot for cat to overcome and it should not be a surprise that she is not liked again it has absolutely nothing to do with misogyny it has to do with the hand she was dealt or written with most readers arent going to bother to really understand her motives after the early impressions they are left with i didnt really understand her motives until a second read knowing how everything would turn out cat supporters here kind of want to have things both ways because they dont want her blamed for things that spiraled out of control after tyrions capture or the red wedding and what followed jaimes release now having read the books multiple times i completely agree that cats actions have less impact than they are often blamed for but just like a reader knowing that tyrion was being unjustly kidnapped it takes outside pov and other book knowledge before you can realize that cats actions dont have as big of an effect you dont know how much other players of the game are working behind the scenes and it takes a while to piece the puzzle together the end result is that at those times in the books when cat takes these actions and when the consequences hit home the typical first time reader with all the knowledge that entails that cat doesnt have will see them as cats fault as much if not more than anybody else yes with careful reading cat can be completely understand and justified but it simply takes a level of reading and understanding that is not natural for most readers particularly on first read and certainly not for most tv watchers either without being privy to the wealth of internal dialogue characters have those of us on this forum are for the most part avid fans of the book series who dont mind reading it over and over but the percentage of people that reread a book series is small and tv shows should not made to be understood on 2nd or 3rd viewing the choice to make cat more likable wasnt about sexism it was about the problems in understanding her on a first readwatch"
"Xerox in 4 Parts",2012-04-05,"that you cant understand a character does not ever ever excuse expressing that lack of understanding or sympathy in sexist ways i dont personally understand how anyone could blame everything all on catelyn even on my first read i dont see how anyone could blame the red wedding on cat especially before blaming it on robb i dont see how that is too hard at all to expect for a reader unless you limit a readers intelligence i never saw a single thing as all cats fault it was quite obvious to me that i was reading a story that embraced the nature of history to be about multiple causes and multiple effectsit is perfectly possible to say i cant get over her treatment of jon without saying shes the wicked stepmother trope incarnate its perfectly possible to say i thought arresting tyrion was a mistake instead of catelyn started the war it is all her fault it is perfectly possible to say her thoughts are too depressing instead of shes a whiny bitch it is perfectly possible to say releasing jaime was foolish instead of singling her out from the entire cast of characters as being emotional it is perfectly possible to dislike her without saying she belongs only back in the kitchen that is not too much to ask of reasonable adults find her a difficult character okay express your difficulties by falling back on sexist attitudes not okayand since this thread is about hbos handling of cat they took out it should have been you which is huge they added warm scenes with her other kids in the first episode and people respond well to michelle fairley they wont have to read her depressive thoughts because of the medium change they didnt change the fact that she arrested tyrion and they probably wont change that she releases jaime so those are mootand if the rationale here is that it is okay for hbo to validate sexist attitudes by showing that cat is a good mom because she wants to go home thats just not okay neither was silencing her contributions as the only woman in warroom in the king in the north scene none of these a woman knows her place things ought to make people like her better and pandering to those attitudes is no matter how you cut it wrong sexist and wrong just because it works doesnt make it rightif catelyn made a big mistake letting jaime go and robb made a big mistake marrying jeyne and then robb on top of that ignores some of catelyns good advice but cat doesnt even have the power to ignore any of robbs good advice theres really no justification for validating the idea that he doesnt need her thus there is really nothing catelyn needs to be ashamed of for insisting that she stay this is compounded and not undercut by the results bran and rickon would have been safe if robb had not let theon go as she suggested sansa and arya would not currently be usable pawns as claims to the north if robb had made the trade for jaime legally as she suggested everyone makes mistakes but saying that catelyn needs to be changed because of them but not robb except in ways that actually give him credit for cats ideas is just unfair it is unfair"

"Honey Badger",2012-04-06,"i just dont see why holding jaime had any sway over the red weddingwhich tywin was planning before he knew anything about what happened if jaime were still a prisoner he would have been left at riverrun and robb and his army would still be killed at the twins once the northern army was decimated it was only a matter of time before the lannisters seized control of riverrun that had nothing specific to do with whether jaime was a prisoner or free its just numbers and dead kingsplus remember when tywin started referring to tyrion as his son he was operating under the assumption that jaime was bound to die personally if i were a stark i would have had bolton start in on jaime and not stop until it was over and robb could hack off his head ned was executed despite the promise of the wall and bran was thrown out of a tower even if it meant sansas life i would have turned it into a full on bloodfeud using jaime as the example the north is a hard place so they would have understood the execution however in gentlemanly kings landing the lannisters would have lost support if they tortured and killed sansa so its more likely they would have kept her alive as a bargaining chip"
"HyacinthGirl",2012-04-07,"to be honest i really dont mind that cats role has beenaltered it makes sense that if robb is getting more screen time a decision im fine with catelyn gets slightly less i dont dislike her but i think a slightly less intense role will work for the show also if any of the writers picked up on the unfair amount of cat bashing that goes on they may have felt the need to tone her down a bit if this means we dont get to see the there is no creature so pitiful as an ugly girl side of her shell be a hell of a lot more popular edited by hyacinthgirl 07 april 2012  0730 am"

"Lord Orys Baratheon",2012-04-08,"i am so glad this thread was started i think catelyns character in the tv show is the worse adaption of any character or story line overall the show is very good but due to being a normal tv show that needs to pander to an average tv audience the character of catelyn has been destroyed in the tv show she comes off as an average typical tv show women one of the main reasons the got books are so great is stereotypical characters are very rare but that is what catelyn feel likes to me in the tv show i dont like catelyn in the books but thats based on some of her choices and decisions overall she is an interesting deep character and a very strong women the books are so great because people like catelyns tv show character are almost non existent and if they do exist they are ridiculed by other characters or they end up being killed anyway sorry if this has been mentioned earlier but i had to get that off my chest show will still be good and its unfortunate that issues like this have to occur but it is part of the business when adapting books into tvmovies i just hope people dont watch the show and see these details then assume the its is an accurate portrayal of the book i hope my other fellow book readers will point this out to friend who only watch the tv show"

"StannisandDaeny",2013-04-21,"so catelyn should somehow have foreseen rooses betrayal roose handled the battle of the green fork well whereas the greatjon was expected to go in all guns blazes and probably lose a lot of his force so i believe catelyn was right on this call too"

"int11",2012-04-04,"a red comet is more realistic than many of other things in the story so i wouldnt complain too much about that the only problem was that it moved slightly back and forth with the camera when we saw it between the tree branches i dont care though edited by int11 04 april 2012  0452 pm"

"Lothar Imbel",2012-04-05,"i actually like ros the actress who plays her is easily a 910 and you get to see her naked basically every time shes on screen the feminist in me just screamed in pain at that also really like the bastard scene as it went from lighthearted brother titilation to a pretty dark and distrubing scene like the one with jory last season"

"WetHair",2012-04-08,"i sort of thought ros looked heavy and surprisingly unattractive compared to last season i dont think administration as opposed to actually being part of the work force agrees with her it was pretty funny though to hear her repeat lfs critical comments to her and apathetic whore 2 as if it were now her own original view and whyever did she happen to have a slew of makeup taking up space in theons bedroom in season one why even need to refresh her looks is she planning on getting more custom between winterfell and town"
"Envie",2012-04-08,"in regards to everyone thinking ros looks fat in season 2 i disagree i think its because she was dressed in kings landing fashion which are heavy brocade dresses with odd front pieces on them and wearing her hair in the wide hairbun fashion favored by ladies there i watched the scene again too and theres part where shes walking away from the guards and you can see the belt  sash around her waist and its still quite a slender waist i think filming and costume make ros look fatter and also she rarely had clothes on at all in previous season so of course she looks different winkpng classbbcemoticon alt  her repeating littlefingers words to her when she first joined his whore house is just a clever way of saying shes now worked her way up the corporate ladder and is now in charge managing the place while littlefingers busy screwing with the throne"

"Envie",2012-04-05,"i would like to say the way they filmed this for the show was absolutely brilliant and simple the viewer who does not read the books is going to have a difficult time understanding the difference between a dream and warging especially since bran himself doesnt understand whats happening to him even osha she has a diff name in the show reassures him that its just a dream which gives the viewer some pause to question whether it really was a dreamthe way they had summerbran peer down at his reflection in the pool was simply awesome and really gave me goosebumps even though i already knew what was happening i think for viewers not reading the books this had to be a pretty significant ah ha moment it also makes you feel so happy for bran because now you realize he has another way to be free and run on legs other than his horse or hodor"

"Francis Buck",2012-04-02,"i watched it with a friend of mine who hasnt read the books and although he grasped that there was some kind of sacrifice going he had no idea why or how melisandre fit into it he also of course had no clue what was up with davos since they dont really explain his role at all in the first episode he did however pick up right away that cressen was trying to poison mel which i honestly thought was pretty vague and i feel like a lot of nonreaders may not totally get what was going there nonetheless i must say that the dragonstone sequence was really the only part of the premiere that i felt was slightly lackluster it could have used even another five minutes just to give a little background on how davos stannis and melisandre all fit with each other the cinematography and acting was great though and i love all three casting choices"

"Lord Varys",2012-04-02,"it is an obvious mistake not to use another additional scene before the burning of the idols the way it is we dont even get mels name in the first episode the clever thing would have been to open the season with the scene with cressen and shireen and the white raven with davos arriving later and talking to him thus some facts could have been declared early on 1 stannis having declared himself king and the situation in the stormlands 2 the growing influence of melisandre on dragonstone 3 a first tidbit about davoss background both mel and stannis would have been much more interesting if people had talked about them before we actually meet them and there would have been space for this in this episode it could have easily been 35 minutes longer"

"Maginor",2012-04-02,"i think it is wrong to view this episode as a standalone entity it fits in as piece in the larger season they will probably explain things a lot better as the season progresses it is not necessary to explain everything about davos and mellisandre in the first episode it is enough to establish that they are there and give a small glimpse into their personalities which they did in a book it is possible to sum things like this up in the thoughts of the characters but on tv it may be better to demonstrate who they are by showing them act"

"Darth Pipes",2012-04-02,"i have to admit finding the poisoning scene to be odd at first but later on i thought it made sense if cressens plan worked melisandre would have died and everyone would have known he did it stannis would have executed him so you might as well plan your own exit strategy the only way to convince show melisandre that the wine was fine was to drink it himself"

"Qhorin Halfhand and Yoren",2012-04-02,"they should have spend more time developing the stannis storyline giving viewers a much better sense of who stannis davos cressen and melisandre are and what is their current position and also adapting great dialogue and character moments the prologue successfully does that in regards to all three and i think it would have made for great television if the episode spend more significant time on that aspect of the storyline the prologue is really a pretty good story and in my view is one of the great chapters of the books this very short in time attempt is not nearly as good and it is somewhat lacking unfortunately patchface might have needed to be cut or to just be a not particularly special fool and their are some inner thoughts that might not be as easy to adapt but the prologue chapter has great dialogue in it and events that work well and it could had been adapted developing cressen viewing stannis and renly as his kids would not be a bad idea either maybe the show would add an additional line or two of cressen saying to davos or someone else how he raised the baratheons and considers them sons and cant allow melisandre possibly leading stannis to kinslaying so yeah i think through some adjustments it was adaptable and it is a loss that it wasnt because it would have made for great television maybe they didnt do so because they only have ten episodes and unlike season one in this season there will be more time spend in battle scenes making time for some storylines even more limited than it might have been in general edited by qhorin halfhand and yoren 02 april 2012  0943 pm"

Fonseca",2012-04-03,"they should have spend more time developing the stannis storyline giving viewers a much better sense of who stannis davos cressen and melisandre are and what is their current position and also adapting great dialogue and character momentsthe prologue successfully does that in regards to all three and i think it would have made for great television if the episode spend more significant time on that aspect of the storyline the prologue is really a pretty good story and in my view is one of the great chapters of the books this very short in time attempt is not nearly as good and it is somewhat lackingunfortunately patchface might have needed to be cut or to just be a not particularly special fool and their are some inner thoughts that might not be as easy to adapt but the prologue chapter has great dialogue in it and events that work well and it could had been adapted developing cressen viewing stannis and renly as his kids would not be a bad idea either maybe the show would add an additional line or two of cressen saying to davos or someone else how he raised the baratheons and considers them sons and cant allow melisandre possibly leading stannis to kinslaying so yeah i think through some adjustments it was adaptable and it is a loss that it wasnt because it would have made for great television maybe they didnt do so because they only have ten episodes and unlike season one in this season there will be more time spend in battle scenes making time for some storylines even more limited than it might have been in generalicam the prologue did a great job of setting the scene or tone as to who davos cressen and stannis are i thought we got some of that in later scenes wstannis but not so much davos and definitely not cressen"
"Lord Godric",2012-04-03,"theres only so much they can do with cressen given the medium we can not get his flashbacks on young baratheon brothers nor can we watch him sitting and sleeping in his chambers for 10 minutes it just wouldnt work i think he could have been introduced differently than as some defender of the faith but i have no large problems with the way the show handled his scenes i dont understand why its necessary that a character be fully explained and their character revealed in one short episode leaving these people are enigmas who want the throne builds more tension"
"The Anti-Targ",2012-04-03,"it makes sense but the problem is that dude was bleeding from his nose almost before he gave mel the cupagreed thats one of the reasons it wasnt a wellwritten sequence on the shownot true really mel had to pause for several seconds to conclusively show that the wine was poisoned in order to demonstrate that she knew she was drinking poison and was confident in her survivali dont know why people are so hung up on developing cressens character there was enough there for people to get the sense that cressen was a maester of aemon or luwins ilk as opposed to tricksy old pycell his purpose was to die so that mels magical prowess could be conclusively demonstrated we dont need any more character development or context for cressen than we got he served his narrative purpose the same as young will in s1e1but those who note mel offered cressen an out in the book are correct that the way mel is portrayed at the moment lacks nuance and subtlety mel isnt all witchypoo the fact she sees worth in davos as stannis adviser will hopefully come through and people will see that she isnt a one dimensional character one of the worst cliches the show could commit this season is to have a one dimensional with characteri wonder if theyll bring thoros of myr into the picture not on dragonstone of course as a priest of rhllor but one who has a likeable and not at all threatening personality if mel is gonna be one dimensional at least let people know that the religion itself isnt but i wonder if the whole brotherhood without banners story arc isnt going to be axed entirely i can see it happening"
"The Bastard of Bolton",2012-04-03,"im with the camp that felt that the poison scene was stupid cressen is a maester he has a deep knowledge of poisons he knows how they kill and how quickly they kill he had enmity towards melisandre she knew it the poison starts to visually kill you within 5 seconds of taking a swallow you simply cant justify the stupidity if something is that kick a killer there is a 99 chance youll be showing signs of being poisoned before your intended victim brings the cup to their lips so you just end up looking like a nutty old man who tried to pull off the shittiest assassination attempt in all of westerosi history i see no reason why they would not keep it closer to the original in this case have cressen offer her the poisoned cup have her smile and whisper it isnt too late to spill it have her take a deep swallow see the disbelief in cressens face have her hand it off to him have him die it wouldnt have taken anymore time to accomplish then this nonsensical scene did honestly this is the one thing in the entire episode that truly disappointed me deeply"
"Eggy",2012-04-03,"the scene is fine if you look at it without the book bias there are less than 10 hours of airtime available its simply impossible to build up minor characters like maester cressen they needed to demonstrate melisandres power by having her drink from a cup of wine she knew to be poisoned without any reservations or fear of her dying this was done brilliantly i really advise people to start watching with an open mind forget the books when watching the show otherwise youll only get more frustrated as the season progresses"
"Songlian",2012-04-03,"it could have used even another five minutes just to give a little background on how davos stannis and melisandre all fit with each other the cinematography and acting was great though and i love all three casting choicesi agree with you completelydidnt really care for cressens exposition but i think they could have explained better who mel is and why they are burning the idols as for the drinking scene i prefer the book variant but the one in the movie works too"
"hoelk",2012-04-03,"i like the book version better but im sorry here drink from this cup sounds kinda ridiculous as a ritual of apology while with cressen taking a sip first it makes slightly more sense to me also stannis and his council authoring the letter was one of the best got scenes so far edited by hoelk 03 april 2012  0621 am"
"boojam",2012-04-03,"i remember o so long ago complaints about the first season first two or three episodes being too slow but i thought dd did a fine job and the elaboration went smooth as silk as if they had worked and reworked those episodes season 1 ends on dany as i have mentioned elsewhere get winterfell and dany covered using the beautiful comet portent i would scrap the nameday thing altogether straight to tyrion coming to the small council that fits with last season to i know the actors are under contract and dd have an obligation to give them screen time but that will come not sure how to order it but when dragonstone comes up give as much expository time  with fitting artistic development as possible too many characters and narrative points which are important to plot are introduced at dragonstone i can see how damnably hard it is to do an adaptation i should not say it but its almost as if dd are overworked they manage a vast production with a good for now budgetand i have to wonder how much time they had to mull that season opener i have to wonder if even alan taylor is squeezed its a shame that the realities of the economics  i am guessing its that shoehorn a rich tapestry into 10 episodes dd have said i think 10 is all they can handle with more help could that be solved"
"tryagainlater",2012-04-03,"i do think the scene was a little rushed i probably would be confused if i hadnt read the books but then again i was a little confused when i read the prologue chapter in acok so maybe its just the act of introducing new characters in such a large narrative i didnt mind cressens self sacrifice but damn that was one fast acting poison"
"Dementia",2012-04-03,"icam the prologue did a great job of setting the scene or tone as to who davos cressen and stannis are i thought we got some of that in later scenes wstannis but not so much davos and definitely not cresseni dont think it matters stannis mel and davos are going to be around for a long time theres really no reason to rush into explaining their characters at this time as someone said it established that stannis is a butt mel is a religious fanatic and davos gives good counsel we have 9 more episodes and at least another season to fill in the details i think the story would be less interesting if they explicitly spelled everything out in the first 3 minutes"
"Dementia",2012-04-03,"i would scrap the nameday thing altogether straight to tyrion coming to the small council that fits with last season tono can do you have to introduce ser dontos and have sansa save him cant get rid of that scene"
"Rockroi",2012-04-03,"on properly setting up stannis and meli know the critisism appears to be that the first episode does not do enough to set up stannis character and his relationship with mel i disagree but i must confess that i would ove to watch an entire episode dedicated to just stannis however its a 10 episode 10 hour show and you just dont have enough time this first episode has to do double duty it must reintroduce every character put them in the story and then reattach that character the overall plot then the show can spend time introducing the new characters and we are only talking about stannis there are a dozen or so new characters that require explination the benefit stannis has over all of them is that stannis will be around for a book or three stannis is in fact a major character in these books there will be ample time to explain many of his traits and details as the season goes on anything remaining will be explained in the seasons to follow this is not the case with other characters who will disappear one way or the other such as renly or the hound as far as mels relationship with stannis and the story being confused well that was true in the book as well hell we are 5 books into the series at this point and frankly we are still not 100 certain how mel got to stannis andor why stannis even trusts her that hazy disconnect to mel is actually part of the character and the readers were completely baffled by her up through clash of kings the viewers will have to wait as well on cressens deathhere i give the show the benefit of the doubt in the book cressens poison play is very hamhanded and openly obvious to all as the scene in the book plays out cressen must drink from his own glass my opinion at the time i read that chapter was that it was unclear to me if mel ever drank the poison or if she somehow was able to physically keep herself from drinking the poison ie the way sugar dissolves in a glass of water it usually ends up settling mostly on the bottom of the glass the reader also got a huge amount of backstory in the prologue a backstory the show could not afford to display hence the reader knows how committed cressen is to stannis the viewer does not and so the show made a very shrewed choice it illiminated both above problems in one fell swoop cressen drinks first much like greedo shooting first in that moment we are shown two things one the wine is definately very poisonous and two that cressen is wiiling to die to take melissandre down thats a huge statement to makebut then you get the added bonus mel knows the audiance knows that mel knows and mel drinks anyway the cup is definately poisonous and mel knows that the poison cannot harm her and it does not with that mel lives and cressen dies overall i can definately see the dissapointments of everyone in that the show was not as faithfuilly translated as prior episodes however i think in every instance there is a logical but by no means completely satisfying answer"
"tirhaka",2012-04-03,"i think they just show horned melisandrecressen and davos in there nobody knows who they aremy girlfriend who never read the books had no idea that he was a maester and why he would want to poison melisandre it just seem like an express ride or a asoiaf highlight reel"

"hesitantreader",2012-04-03,"it is sloppy story telling because all they needed to do was add one or two lines of dialogue before cressen hobbles down the beach and people could have understood the significance of burning the seven i also think that they should have found time for cressen to argue against war with renely but i understand that somethings need to be cut from the story"
"Dementia",2012-04-03,"there are other ways of solving thatid like to hear your rewrite"
"Xtopher",2012-04-03,"and so the show made a very shrewed choice it illiminated both above problems in one fell swoop cressen drinks first much like greedo shooting first in that moment we are shown two things one the wine is definately very poisonous and two that cressen is wiiling to die to take melissandre down thats a huge statement to makei agree with this if that was their way of letting viewers know that cressen is all about protecting stannis then cool im willing to accept the changes from the book lol"

"White Harbors Wrath",2012-04-03,"cressens death scene was finetheres precious little time as it is per episodethey didnt need to waste anymore of it developing cressen if you were paying attention to the show you could 1 clearly see him drop the poison in 2 see davos notice this then ask him not to 3 see cressen drink first knowing it would be his demise adding impact because he opposed her so vehemently he was willing to take his own life in taking hers 4 see her watching cressen visibly dying from poison contemplating the act and then drinking from the cup herself showing shes not subject to normal rules 5 see some magic glowy thing glowing while she explains shes not subject to the same rules it really couldnt have been shown much clearer than thatdid the poison act fast on cressen sure probably too fastbut why would i wanted to see 30 seconds more of an old man watching a woman wait to drink from a cup theres absolutely no value in that outside wasting more time with fluff we have 10 hours to get this whole book in its things like this that dont need to be shown they cant afford to give us as nuanced of character development as grrm does in the booksand theyre dealing with a viewing base that for the most part from week to week wouldnt remember what happened the week prior wo a recap edited by white harbors wrath 03 april 2012  1206 pm"
"Francois Clegane",2012-04-03,"i agree about the worshipping of the lord of the light this is going to be confusing for viewers who havent read the books as if they miss words in a line here and there theyre not going to know who the lord of light or davos are and why the residents of dragonstone are rejecting the seven besides this i thought melisandre has been portrayed brilliantly whilst davos character also fits though i expected him to look a bit younger i thought stannis would be a bit taller and maybe a bit broader but again i think hell be portrayed well throughout the series such as where he states he didnt love his brother when writing the letter to be sent throughout westeros"

"Francois Clegane",2012-04-03,"stannis somewhat seems to be a soft character from what is shown in the first episode he shows a bit of authority but he doesnt display the kind of domination on screen what his brother robert did hopefully it improves in the remaining episodesi agree when you say he doesent really show alot of authority on screen but i love the way hes portrayed as a man who purely sees things in black and white such as when hes talking about him being the only rightful king opposing davos suggestions and calling jaime what he is when he tells his scribe to refer to him as kingslayer"

"Kaitscralt",2012-04-03,"i didnt mind the scene as much as others but i most definitely thought that cressen drinking the wine first if the effects were immediate were pretty suspect i mean even if melisandre were a normal woman he began showing adverse effects almost immediately what if she paused to give a little toast or something im not sure what his plan was there"
"Envie",2012-04-03,"and so the show made a very shrewed choice it illiminated both above problems in one fell swoop cressen drinks first much like greedo shooting first in that moment we are shown two things one the wine is definately very poisonous and two that cressen is wiiling to die to take melissandre down thats a huge statement to makebut then you get the added bonus mel knows the audiance knows that mel knows and mel drinks anyway the cup is definately poisonous and mel knows that the poison cannot harm her and it does not with that mel lives and cressen diesoverall i can definately see the dissapointments of everyone in that the show was not as faithfuilly translated as prior episodes however i think in every instance there is a logical but by no means completely satisfying answeri like this way of looking at it nicely saidat first i was a little put off with the fact they had cressen drink the wine first but after thinking it through i think i agree that for brevity sake  it somewhat makes more sense to have cressen drink first which to most people would seem like a much more believable way to get someone else who you dont know anything about to drink  after youve drank it yourself fans who havent read the books are not going to have the luxury of all the back story pov and other important bits that led up to cressens choice and how others at the table did or did not know and therefore it may not have been as obvious if hed tried to get her to drink firstas for how the scene with the burning idols played out i was ok with it i think they could have explained what the burning idols were a bit better but to me it seemed fairly obvious this was a religious ceremony and melisandre is obviously some sort of foreign but powerful priestess converting them the audience of the ceremony didnt seem all that particularly happy about it but like most commoners they stood silently and watched because the message has to be clear that stannis their lord wishes this to happen and theyre pledged to him so they must follow his lead as far as simplified for television it was ok"
"Vikingkingq",2012-04-04,"i actually think the change works in the book cressens pov lets us see his anticipation that this might actually work its following his thoughts and feelings in the show instead of seeing melisandre drink what we think she doesnt know is poison we see her willingly chug what we know she knows to be poison and shrug it off  that really emphasizes how powerful she is how different she is from anything weve seen so far edited by vikingkingq 04 april 2012  1203 am"
"mrnegativity",2012-04-04,"im totally fine with throwing the audience into the deep end i mean grrm does that all the time in the books its only the first episode these things will become clearer to nonreaders as the story unfolds to me there are only a few things the audience really needs to take away1stannis basic character traits he is stubborn blunt and not going to join anyone calling themselves king2there is some sort of religious turmoil going on3the red priest is a force to be reckonded withthe other details will come and when the audience does fully understand they will appreciate rewatching that scene morei completely agree the beginning of acok was confusing as shit but thats ok the confusion sucks you in and it will almost certainly suck viewers in this time round who is the hot woman in red who is this scowling dude that tried to stop the old guy poisoning the red woman why is stannis such a hardass etc"

"CladInShadows",2012-04-04,"i think a lot of these little differences would have been a lot more thought out than youd at first think if cressen had waited until after melisandre had drunk and had appeared to die from strangulation there is a very high chance that many viewers may have interpreted that as melisandre killing him rather than him sacrificing himself to kill her think about it  in the sequence from the book she drinks first then he drinks and keels over unable to breathe this could make it seem as if she has realized there was something in her drink and is using her magic to choke him darth vader style in retaliation i think both the fact that he began suffering after drinking from his cup but before having actually poisened her and the fact that the blood coming from the mouth emphasied that it was the drink which had killed him may have been very deliberate"
"Auska",2012-04-04,"just rewatched the scenes and i have to revise my earlier assessment to even more positive i think i managed to miss some parts the first time they dont really go into detail about the seven but the scene makes it clear that theyre abandoning their old gods and not doing so lightly the sideways glances and bowed heads were very well done by the extras it also sets up cressens situation pretty well the poisoning isnt too bad as the two above posts explain though the ruby glow could have been a little less subtle i think they mostly just left it as a nod to the readers since its obvious theres some magic at play anyway still didnt quite like melisandre in the first scene outside though maybe its just the wildish hair my mental picture was always very neat no big deal and i think they could have highlighted selyse a little more unless i missed it again edited by auska 04 april 2012  0526 am"

"Mark Erikson",2012-04-07,"i was also disappointed that there wasnt a prologue these worked really well for lost each season started with a teaser of something youd never seen before season 2 with desmond season 3 with the village season 4 withwhatever the show really started to go off the rails around then and this was usually compelling for got i foresaw the arrival of neds letter by raven with a cool opening shot of a raven in flight this would introduce cressen who receives the raven then stannis who gets to sit and listen to cressen reading the message which would provide a nice recap and tiein to season 1 and davos and melisandre who would be standing by to advise when stannis declares that he is now the rightful king cut to credits and return later to cover cressen trying to poison melisandre obviously my powers of prediction arent that great but i feel that this would have been a pretty good way to get the season started while introducing a new major player to the scene also putting stannis up first makes it obvious that he is a major player whereas throwing him into the mix with all the familiar characters doesnt really make him stand out i also didnt particularly like the casting of stannis he seemed whiny to me i always saw stannis as a warrior type with no sense of humour because he just takes everything very seriously this portrayal made him look like a guy who had no humour because hes been teased his whole life and turned into a pathetic loser"

"Aurelian",2012-04-08,"as someone who watched the first season of game of thrones before i had read any of the books i would say that many things in the first season were at first confusing eg i was very confused about tommen and myrcella for a while as they barely appear in the first season but become clearer over time and i think it was a good decision to not explain everything straight away and trust that people would follow the show and pick things up in the same way i do think the first scenes on dragonstone could be confusing for people who have not read the books but think like in the first season things will become clear for them"

"sennahoj",2012-04-02,"great episode of course there had to be a lot of exposition such as introducing stannis as a new player to the game of thrones part of me thinks they shouldve shown renlys camp as well since all the other contenders for the crown are shown but thats just a minor issue overall the many settings were woven together nicely my favourite was the opening scene in kings landing with the melee joffrey was delightfully cruel in dealing with dontos but i just loved tyrions entry with his mountain clan retainers totally confuses the little king tyrion doesnt like joffrey who shares cerseis hate of tyrion but he seems to genuinely care for the other two children peter dinklage was really great in that scene and then crashing into small council meeting was just the icing on the cake the dany scene was a little too short for my taste but it nevertheless conveyed the desperate situation her little khalasar is in shame we only saw one of the dragons though"

"Laohu",2012-04-03,"one piece of defense that some have offered is that the format of the s2 premiere allowed for an equal amount of time allotted for both the new s2 characters and all of the familiar s1 characters perhaps the tv audience needed just as much time to get reacquainted with their favorite characters from s1 but i thought that was what the 23 minutes of s1 overview before the episode even started was meant for we got our refresher course on s1 now lets dive into s2 with something new and fresh what better way to do that then showcase dragonstone alas it did not turn out the way i expected it to kissdbyfire i can see where you are coming from with the information overload argument but i think that is all the more reason to put it at the beginning of the episode a prologue before the opening credits  main title sequence would have put some separation between dragonstone and the rest of westeros oh lets not forget daenerys in the red waste the audience would have had a minute or two to ponder all those new characters while getting prepared for the rest of the episode instead we see the introductions of stannis party right in the middle of the episode which i really felt was out of place stannis melisandre and davos deserved a better entrance than what they received in my opinion ultimately these characters all three of which play integral roles in the main story had a very forgettable intro"
"Lord Varys",2012-04-03,"davos was named by stannis in episode 1 i said stanniss introduction was okay but only because we already know that a guy named stannis baratheon exists the whole point in the dragonstone storyline in the book is that melisandre and her new religion are perceived as a threat by the gooddecent guys instead there is talk about fools and fanatics but we dont know why or how this is the case its neither mentioned that melisandre is a foreigner nor is it elaborated that her god has virtually no followers in westeros stannis story is always about choices and ethics it would have been powerful if the question does mel get her way would have been the main theme of the dragonstone arc in episode 1"

"Qhorin Halfhand and Yoren",2012-04-04,"random perhaps relevant fact the season one first episode was longer by about seven minutes than this one as i think the prologue chapter is just a great story that very well introduces us to the characters of davos stannis cressen and even the politics in ds yeah it should have been adapted but what about the inner thoughts and other information i read it yesterday it has a lot of great dialogue that works even without inner thoughts and shows people like davos reacting to events in ways that explains a lot about them while we can also learn about how much stannis is unsupported how stannis is pissed for not getting storms end and in more detail why and how he feels unloved still some important things would be lost like the explanation of how davos saved stannis this can perhaps be explained later on in another episode to replace some of the lost inner thoughts we can have cressen be shown as frail and weak and having difficulty maneuvering without that much time being spend on that have him share a line to someone where he says how he has seen all baratheon boys grow he loves them as sons and maybe in that part of dialogue he would also say that their father had died the dialogue itself that is already in the prologue spoiler about renlys possible assassination and how he is so against kinslaying which would show why he does what he does it would be sort of a spoiler for only tv show readers though if the actor is particularly great he can also make us particularly understand about his emotions for stannis the baratheon kids in general and his loyalty and care about him that we instead get from inner thoughts in the books cressens increased desperation and alienation could also be successfully shown and again good acting can mitigate the loss of inner thoughts patchface might have to be removed entirely and some adjustments to some of the dialogue should been made but it is adaptable and it would make for great television also there is a difference between geting a glimpse of what characters are and understanding what a character is how and why he is in that way in detail the second is different than the first and much better and that is why stannis and davos and cressen of just the prologue of acok is much better than the stannis of this episode even without inner thoughts we can get something approaching the great characterization found in the prologue of the book and of course it is a good story if you care about cressen and in the episode it wasnt that much special of a story as in the chapter so yeah i definitely would have preferred if it was adapted edited by qhorin halfhand and yoren 04 april 2012  1247 am"

"Iotun",2012-04-06,"i didnt mind the scene i also think that being book readers the opinions of many are biased i feel that dd have earned a certain level of trust in their decisions based on the first season  and im sure theyve considered carefully where each and every scene needs to be placed for best effect and what needs to be included in it i dont think their decisions are flawless but in this case i find fault with all the opinions of complaining readers herethe season has a lot of material to cover and a limited amount of time and scenes to cover it every aspect of a scene must serve some function there are elements that need to be introduced there are also elements that are not needed to be introduced and in fact introducing them makes the adaptation bloated and confusing there are also elements that it is good to leave some confusion aboutsome have complained that who the lord of light was and what was the function of melisandre had been unclear and that the religious aspect of the scene was confusing and not properly explained i think that it is a wise choice to leave some confusion there the viewer for the first time does not need to be given a diatribe on the religious background of the seven kingdoms and the difference between the lord of light and the seven gods the viewer is left with the impression that something uncomfortable and with religious colouring is going on and that there is a mysterious and charismatic woman involved the viewer is left with unanswered questions about who everybody is and what is going on  but his interest is raised and he now has a mystery to solve that makes him want to come back this is a mystery that will be solved we are bound to come back to stannis and mel time and time again and the lord of light will be involved in almost every scene so the initial confusion will eventually be resolved by the viewer who will have the nice feeling and satisfaction of figuring it out on the other hand we have cressen his role is not clearly developed other than to show that he is a servant of stannis who dies trying to stop the mysterious woman some have complained that his character lacks the detail of the book his love for the baratheon brothers his long years of service his devotion and thus the depth of his sacrifice but on the books we have a rather lengthy chapter where we are involved quite deeply into his thoughts and get to have those thoughts explicitly stated to us cressen cant go outright and make a monologue about those feelings as it would waste valuable screen time and seem unnatural he can give hints about his relationship to make this more natural but this is likely to cause confusion to the nonreader nonreaders have yet to be introduced to stannis in depth yet many will need to have his relationship with renly and robert refreshed when cressen is given more depth nonreaders will be wondering this guy is devoted to whom which brothers what is going on here this is a bad kind of confusion though cressen has to die so he will not be revisited again for the confusion and the mystery to be resolved by episode 3 most viewers will have forgotten about him so the introduction of confusion by trying to give him depth doesnt serve any purpose doesnt get resolved into satisfactory insight it simply leaves a confusing first episode it is only upon rewatch after the end of the season that the nonreader would have figure out the significance of cressens deeper character attributes are and dd cannot have the luxury of working with that in mindfurthermore the specific suggestions by many here simply seem much worse for example lord varys writesprincess shireen the bird looks funny maester cressen why is it whitemaester cressen white ravens herald a change of seasons my princess the long summer is finally at an end winter is comingprincess shireen am i going to die in winter patchface says everyone will die in wintermaester cressen no my dear no one is going to dieprincess shireen father will the servants say he has not enough men to fight they say no one loves stannis baratheon no one in all the seven kingdoms and no one loves memaester cressen i do ive always loved you my princess as ive loved your lord father his brothers did not need my love but your father did you remind me of himno offense but i think that is a very bad suggestion does the show have the luxury to focus on shireen on patchface no introducing these minor characters at all will again simply create massive amounts of the wrong kind of unresolved confusion the nonreader goes wow whos the weird girl and whats wrong with her face and does the show have the time to answer that question whats a patchface whos her father who are his brothers whos the old man whats going on here well cressen is about to die shireen and patchface are not to be seen for a long time and all were left is a confusing messthe particular scene has to be there because it shows mels power that shes not an impostor and because the fans would have a fit if it was omitted the burning of the idols also has to be there as it gives support for future scenes when likely tyrion will use stannis abandoning the seven as propaganda against him lets come now to the placement of the scenes and whether they should have been seen as a porologue or not im pretty sure that what the opening scene for the season is would have been one of the most thought of decisions and that it wasnt done lightly and i i agree with their current placement for a few reasonsstructurally we must have the montage style previously on type of prologue to get people up to speed it just has to be there dramatically you place a rising musical score to it that reach its climax at the end goes quite then you get the hbo logo then the introduction music it makes sense and is very powerful to end the climax of the first prologue to enter a second prologue which is then to have a second climax and drop to the hbo logo and intro is a bit more unwieldy and even perhaps a bit cheesy moreover stannis is not the white walkers a mystery that we see right at the start that is then meant to be kept hidden from us season long stannis has to be introduced in the meat of the episode as it were which means that we must have a stannis scene at the middle of the episode were the dragonstone scenes to be put at the start then we would be left with no stannis material to put in the rest of the episode we could draw material from the second episode you can say but then we would have no material for the second episode and so on im sure that theres a very precise distribution of stannis scenes and messing with their order would then harm the pacing of the story you could say that we could leave the burning of the idol scenes as the scene in the middle of the episode but the scene has to come before cressens sacrifice to give some context as to why mel is disliked otherwise cressens sacrifice creates unnecessary confusion furthermore the burning scene would have been somewhat bare where it not for the addition of the conversation between davos and cressen afterwardsthe one thing im slightly uncertain about is whether mel should have given cressen an out i probably think she should but perhaps im biased in that way because i like mel after adwd but perhaps dd felt that giving even a hint of compassion to her character so early on may be unwise before the mysterious magical woman aspect of her is establishedperhaps that is wise we only know that mel has more humane side to her because we had the luxury of being in her head in adwd we in fact also know that it is her goal to give an aura of impenetrable mystery around her for the nonreader to come out of the scene with anything other than an oh evil red witch impression could in fact be construed as a failure of mel herself to project herself as she wants to"

"PatrickStormborn",2012-04-06,"dont think were missing it at all im pretty sure i can tell the difference between people on screen and reading in a book but theres good adaptation and theres bad adaptation dragonstone was bad they frittered away all the potential drama and turned it into an inert meetandgreet and off to something else they had several ways of adapting to screen that would have made a stronger narrative instead they pared away all the useful functions of cressen except oh she has magic and youre left with very littledo nonreaders think its fine maybe they do maybe they dont notice that the maesters nameless and they dont give a damn about him and they dont really understand why he did what he did  melisandre has magic nothing else matters but thats csilevel of bythenumbers writing go watch a topnotch episode of mad men or the sopranos and youll see writing that works on several levels and does so economicallyefficiency and depth are not mutually exclusive1 why waste time naming a character who dies straight away its not relevant to the plot dd are adapting the series theyre not adapting the book wordforword2 i think its quite easy to grasp why he tried to kill melisandre because of her influence stannis has burned his gods and shes encouraging him to go to war this woman will lead him into a war he cannot win cressen tries to kill herknowing it will kill him tooin an attempt to stop her influence over stannis all of this is clear in the scenesi do think that the dragonstone scenes could have been fleshed out a bit more but overall i think the producers did a great job without confusing the audience too much"

"Lady Octarina",2012-04-01,"for me its not a question of fidelity i absolutely loved all the nonros additions to season 1 the robertcersei scene in particular was one of my favorites the reason i disliked the cerseilittlefinger scene is that its completely out of character for littlefinger he had that big speech in s1 talking about how fighting them was their game and demonstrated that he was very well aware of his strengths and limitations there is no advantage to giving away his game like that and quite a big disadvantage littlefinger isnt stupid and that was an amateur movewell i didnt love that scene but i thought it was an interesting addition it wasnt about littlefinger but cersei i mean it seems to me that shows how ruthless cersei can be and impulsive foolish actually something we only see much farther in the books i also find it wonderful that they included that scene plus her interaction with joffrey on the same episode like a nonacknowledged competition of senseless tyrants which also shows just how much of her he has funny it also takes him much longer in the books for him to actually defy her to her face does that happen at all actually but i guess it makes sense considering they aged the character"
"Sonic The Hedgehog",2012-04-01,"in regards to the clips for whats coming this season that was showed at the end of the episode was that renly and margeary in the scene with a woman talking about her husband being king and then the two of them kissing if so im curious how thatll be handled it could just be a scene to emphasize renlys homosexuality by him rejecting margeary before sex but i always assumed from the books that she knew about renlys orientation but if he actually manages to play along with it somehow as his duty then thatll have some pretty far reaching effects for margearys story in the later books and her claim of being a virgin the show might wind up giving us a definitive answer about that before the books even do"
"Jessica Bendis",2012-04-01,"i really wish they wouldve opened the same way clash of kings did  on dragonstone with cressen i realize the importance of quickly giving the audience a glimpse of familiar faces but i thought the cok prologue wouldve worked really well loved seeing dragonstone in the opening credits too i anticipate the opening sequence as much as the show itself feels likealso cressen came across as a shady and conniving douche rather than a sympathetic martyr when he tried to kill mel on the show imo you almost felt relieved that he failed more than you felt sorry for him i think more of an effort shouldve gone into expressing his hopelessness and how everyone turned away from him when he had once been so respected also they seemed to have changed that stannis knew about the incest before ned i guess stan got neds letter and it was the first time he heard the news dont know how i feel about that seems to undermine stannisi dont know if it is because i really like stannis and just wanted to see more of him but i felt they wasted some time on littlefingers stupid scene when they could have used it to develop more the dragonstone characters when the episode started i was expecting to see the prologue of clash but that didnt happen ok and when the scene actually came it felt very rushed to me i was very surprised when cressen started to defy melisandre while they were actually in the middle of burning the seven but okay hopefully we will see more of them next week"
"Ran",2012-04-01,"axels15 the prologue in the novel gives us emotional resonance to cressens death it gives us a sense of how powerful and scary melisandre is and it provides some more sense of who stannis is and why there are people who care for him and are so loyal i love dillanes performance but i should note that for nonreaders hes going to be quite the cipher at least until episode 4 when we start to get more of him"

"Rockroi",2012-04-01,"so a few commnets on a strong start to clash of kingshere is what i liked1 tyrion lannister hand of the kingtyrion is the moral center of clash of kings and clash is tyrions greatest triumph everyone shits on him in storm hes abscent in feast uitterly forgettable in dance tyrion plays the game neuters cersei immunizes the kingdom from joff saves a realm rules a kingdom and defeats stannis the start of this episode has to make you believe that that tyrion is growing into the end this episode was a phenominal start tremendous writing as tyrion shows equal parts politician power broker military strategist and jester  and high cheek bones dinklage is tremendou and his interplay with joff and especially cersei was very well done its good to see that the tyrion we last saw with tywin is the same tyrion who will now be the man i like characters that pick up right wheer we left them2 robb stark rebel kingi thought that robbs overall character was equal parts rebel and equal parts king hes a very layered character and its starting to show here in the build up over neds death martin has staed that the closest thing he has come to a regret in the series is not giving robb a pov the series has done that you see that robb is balancing several different motivations he wants to do right by the north he wants to lead a kingdom but he also wants venegence i thought his scenes with cat were very good the actor playing robb swings between hardline king to deeply wounded son i like that robb admits that his peace terms to tyrion are designed to be rejected and that he wants to treat with renly because he knows he cannot march on kings landing another really good rise of an otherwise muted character in the books 3 stannis baratheon first of his name king of the andals and the roynar stannis chapters look like they need to build stannis is being portrayed in the same ebb and flow as the books a prickly and proud monster who means what he says and says what he means and would make any man wonder how anyone could love this man hes the newest thing on our plate so the show will introduce him slowly not sure how i feel that the undercurrent of stannis is that he could be in mels thrawl well see 4 jaime lannister an enemy worth keeping i dont quite know what they will do with jaime but i like that jaime still demands our attention i like that he mocks robb and that robb can play back and finally a cgi direwolf was that so hard5 craster liked it i think they captured craster is father husband ruler monster and i really liked that in just a few glimpses he and mormont were able to convey that they have a deep and tense past strong stuff 6 maester lewin  brani like intelligence and kindness together in one place and i get that in lewin lewin is ultra practical and wise and gives bran the understanding he deserves with bran i find humanity i love that bran insists at looking at his reflection to remind himself hes a boy 7 cerse and joff babykillersi think that joffs powerhunger is well on its way to burning out of control and with great reason the spoiled child without boundries will now be the out of control ruler without boundries his desire to kill roberts bastards is the actions of a monster cersei seems not only powerless to stop him but is compelled to assist and i like that their own men dont love this on the fence 1 hey look roz yeah ah we  we get it  shes  still here in many ways roz is fine but also overexposed and seems to be in too much shes the new much and more the same way much and more was used admosium iin dance roz is suddely everywhere in the series it kinda makes sense that shes here but we feel we are hearing more of her than we really should 2 sheaoh so they didnt wise up and fx this is it season 4 yet 3 dannywe promise that very soon we will have something for you to do or burn until then how about another scene with you and irri 4 we swear it was the only breast plate aroundeither evel kineval was a house in westeros or ser dontos house colors bear a striking resemblance to the us flag it wasnt good or bad just  interesting like george w bushs head alongside septa mordanes and neds in the last episode what i did not like1 in case you forgotso everytime somebody mentions robbs name the guys around him have to repeat the king in the north really that doesnt seem the slightest bit  lame i mean if he is shagging some farmers daughter out there and she yells out oh robb do the guards outside his door start saying the king in the north overall a very dense and fulfilling episode that did much of what it needed to do but not a whole lot more"

"legba11",2012-04-02,"first impressions i liked it though it as very much a somewhat disorganized intro to 55 stories i think they would have been better served by sticking to three the iron throne stories and add the others next week people would have been upset to not see jon and dany but they are side stories this season i strongly disagree with many folks here about cersei littlefinger this is the tv show game of thrones not some moving pictures to go along with the books it is a perfect setup for their futures you see cerseis problem as a ruler she thinks just because she has the strongest hand in the present that is all she needs to rule she has the power yet she is so unsure of her standing she lashes out with grotesque displays of power and makes enemies for no reason other than to remind herself that she currently has power this has two aspects for lf first we get to see what was only told to us before how the true power houses crap all over him and more importantly littlefinger has to realize how unstable this ruling family is and he is safer outside of their immediate reach so what does he do in the near future he goes to highgarden and returns with a queen and army loyal to him and then quickly leaves again to claim his true power in sos the hated ros scene also backs this up he has transferred control of his moneymaker to her so he can leave kings landing this scene perfectly sets the table for cerseis and lfs futures i agree that craster was a bit too refined for my taste i pictured him as a pasthisprime brute otherwise a good scene mormonts reaction to jon was a bit much opening scene was brilliant almost perfect i dont understand the dislike of sophie turner i think she has been perfect in 110 and this episode joffery is much stronger than he was portrayed in the books his scene with cersei dramatically changes the dynamic in kl until may 2013 countdown to that begins now the writes wisely made catelyn a much more palatable character i find how terrible of a mother she is distracting in the books she tries to do the right thing and robb makes her do what is best for the realm rather than her family damn that stark blood dany scene was meh but her entire arc in cok is meh so anything good that comes out of it is a huge plus she becomes my second favorite character starting with book 3 so this isnt dany hate stannismelisandredavos are perfect great scene though i agree you dont feel for the maesters attempted sacrifice they instead use that scene to really push melisandre as a seriously dangerous force brans wolf scene was a nice plus"

"Dr. Pepper",2012-04-02,"one of my favorite scenes was with dontos at first i was bored because it was just weird acting and i knew the basics of what would happen but as the wine was being poured down his throat i thought ha theyre waterboarding him then i got a look at his armor and had to rewind its like hes got the american flag cant help but wonder if the producers are making a wee political statement there i really liked the scene with littlefinger and cersei it reminded viewers what type of power lf has and that his motives are often unclear but i think the scene was more about cersei she talks about power being power but the only real power she displayed was the ability to have paid loyalty when we first see her in the episode shes at the head of the small council but her power there falters when tyrion shows up in the small council meeting she reminds the audience and slynt that his wealth comes directly from her thus his loyalty belongs to her what happens when that isnt there she doesnt even have complete power over joffrey after he put her on notice i think that scene is particularly amusing for the book readers because we know that when tyrion starts breaking apart her team of paid mercenaries is when she really starts to falter i generally like ros in season 1 we learn a lot about some characters through her interactions with them we also learn that she probably knows a lot about winterfell and the north and that she collects secrets while whoring i think her being madame whore trainer in this episode gave an indication of where her story can go they didnt use jeyne poole for whatever reason and they made a big deal about arya being missing ros the whore trainer could become ros the arya trainer littlefinger has a gold mine with all the knowledge ros carries"

"Ser Greguh",2012-04-02,"short review i enjoyed it unconditionallyregarding individual scenes ill start with littlefingercerseifirst off having watched the scene a few times i think the goofy voice discrepancies are due to slightly sloppy adr im about 90 that the wide shot that opens the scene is looped and they didnt do a great job with matching it to the later sequences which are not looped which may be the actors fault but may also be the result or poor sound editingsecond i find all the claims of lf wouldnt possibly be so stupid to be a little off base for all the negative attention his brothel training scene received last season it seems more than a little funny to me that so many people have catastrophically missed his central point conveyed in it which is that nobody will believe him if hes not behaving like a snarky untrustworthy scoundrel but that his talent is in getting people to believe that hes their untrustworthy scoundrel a kind of seduction that mimics what hes teaching his prostitutes this scene was something of a failed inroad along those lines indicating that the tricks that workes so spectacularly well with ned wont work with cersei shes too paranoid to believe that hes on her side no matter what so his prodding as to the rumors of cerseis relationship with jaime and the fact that he knows the truth of it is completely in character with whats established in showpetyr thusfar particularly given that cersei goaded him by mentioning his one weak spot catelyn its not exactly the same character as bookpetyr but it never has been and frankly i think a direct translation of bookpetyr would be disastrously transparent and not worked nearly as well to anyone but the most stingy of book puriststhe scene also nicely conveyed one side of the shows clear primary theme power and nicely differentiated the rather direct and clumsy way that cersei wields hers from the more subtle forms conveyed by littlefinger varys and tyrion i didnt get a vibe of them setting up littlefingers eventual betrayal of the lannisters at allre maester cressen  dragonstonefirst of all i really loved the scene on the beach just beautifully shot with stephen dillane giving a fantastically stuffy and unconvincing echo of melisandres the night is dark and full of terrors i also thought the scene where stannis is dictating changes to his spam ravenmail to be absolutely pitchperfect literally could not have been betterall that said cressens arc was clearly rushed and didnt come out nearly as effective as it might have been as a result i understand why they didnt open with the exact prologue i like the prologue but its also huge and if filmed in its entirety would have been like half an episode but i think if they could have possibly squeezed one more scene in perhaps a scene that is just between cressen and davos im thinking specifically of their conversation on the stairs it would have made it work much better its a shamethough the pov shot as cressen dies and the ruby on mels necklace growing was perfectre dontosthis was easily my least favorite part of the episode dontos came off as just a moron when he should have been completely blotto on wine and he seemed incredibly nonchalant about having been nearly killed its going to be difficult to buy this guy as the selfimagined tragic hero that thinks he can save sansa from kings landing i dont think the actor is right and i dont think that that aspect of the scene was wellwritten kind of like the discovery of the direwolves in s1 i felt like it was just ticking off a necessary plot point and that the scene would have needed just a little more space and a few more lines back and forth to breathe correctly far from fatal to the episode as a whole but it could have been much betteri totally dont get the sansa hate from certain corners sophie turner played it perfectlyre crasterwhats this crap about how he should look like a frey read his chapters again hes big and powerful i also disagree that he was too clean  hes cleaner than described in the books but i think thats just a booktoscreen translation thing the visual translation of this cleancut guy whos doing all of these vile things against all the dirty nights watch people that are living up to this nobel ideal is too potent to pass up also it makes sense that hes a bit clean  pampered given that he has all these women to take care of himjames cosmo mormont also killed it in his scenes dudes a boss glad to see him promoted to the main creditsre the cleansing of the bastardsit was definitely cersei that gave the order in the books and im 95 that theyre changing it to joffrey in the show which im actually okay with partly its a consequence of aging up the character bookcersei was largely indifferent to joffs unchecked sadism and in certain ways coddled it while it looks like showcersei is being portrayed as being aware of it but completely impotent to stop it which makes the dynamic a bit more sympathetic to cersei which im okay with and highlights her overall incompetence while lessening her own viciousness i think thats in line with where she eventually lines up once she is actually in power for real and i think its as good a take on the character as the show could probably dothe scene itself particularly the scene in the brothel was effectively brutal a fantastic holy shit hook to lead in to the next episode it was a fantastic touch to show the goldcloak that was unable to kill the child and have janos slynt have to do the deed himself an obvious redundancy with the book character of allar deem which sets him up nicely for nonreader viewers as a fantastically effective tertiary villain was it the same goldcloak that had the same omfg what have i become look on his face as he held back the mob while they carried the dead infant out of the brothel i dont know its too hard to tell with those damn uniforms but regardless that was the best part of that scenere rosi didnt harbor the ros hate that many seemed to last season and i think that esme bianco did a very good job in the role shes obviously now in the chataya role which was unexpected i expected her to take over alayayas spot and its possible theyre morphing the chatayaalayaya role into one that shes handling which i think is fine already a madam and ffs do we really have people calling her a queen whore or whatever its a madam people like littlefinger himself her rise has been swift and meritbasedre joffreyfirst jack gleeson is killing it in the role holy crap he just has joffreys mannerisms down perfectly the arrogant sneer could not be any more practiced and effortless i have a feeling its only going to get better david  dan are not stupid they know that joffrey is probably the character that most viewers are responding most to and theyre going to milk it for all its worth he may well be the mosted hated character in television history by the end of the season which is as it should be the little shitre tyrionspeaking of killing it dinklage is i think going to give us a complete fucking tour de force this year that makes his emmywinning turn last year look amateurish in comparison its all about the material of course acok is very much tyrions book and his chapters in book 2 are my favorite in the series you can just see his command of the character and the scene that really stood out was in his conversation with cersei when she tells him that arya escaped such a perfect takeunfortunately i dont know if his emmy win can be repeated since theres just no way hes a supporting actor any more first billing in the credits likely means hell be competing with people with alliterative names come awards season don draper walter white and its tough to win against an alliterativelynamed character it is knownre danyi actually did get a bit of a romantic vibe between dany and rakharo not so much in that she wants anything to happen but that she knows her hold is so tenuous that shes willing to milk a bloodriders unrequited feelings for her a brief scene in any case also yay dragons drogon looked fantastic i noticed they had a separate dragon unit and wolf unit listed in the credits hehre robbrichard madden is an effective badass the scene where he dominates the shit out of jaime was nicely played the scene between him and catelyn was also fantastic theres still a hint of child left he raises his voice to her which as king of course he should never have to do and that perfectly sells his sending her off to treat with renly nicely mirroring the book as catelyn thinks to herself kings were not meant to have mothersand i dont care what tricks they used to get grey wind on screen like that it was awesome"

"aghrivaine",2012-04-02,"hallo all most of what i felt has been said already as is so often the case but ill chime in on the littlefingercersei confrontation like a lot of you probably did i rewatched the last season over the weekend this time with the commentaries on i noticed that again and again the writers actors director producers  all mentioned over and over the relationship this seems to be the lens through which they are approaching the story  a series of relationships that taken together constitute a plot i understand that an actor will necessarily have to thoroughly comprehend his or her characters relationship to the other people in the scene its what makes their interactions breathe and seem real but i think its now officially been taken too far  as this confrontation seemed to exist solely to flesh out cersei and littlefingers relationship they are both wielders of soft power  however much it galls both of them and theyre both competing for the same influence and authority as is varys but hes just better at keeping his cards close to his chest i dont think this scene shed any particular light on their individual characters or their relationships to each other that wouldnt have been clear from previous or eventual interactions further from a screenwriting perspective their dialogue  and especially littlfingers  is far too on the nose meaning it exactly states what the characters ambition or desire is rather than illustrating it through other means that one scene stuck out like a sore thumb as being both unnecessary and poorly written both actors approached it like champs though and so it wasnt completely wasted but it definitely stuck out to me contrast that with the confrontation between robb and jaime here we go with more relationsihps i predict in the commentary for this season both actors will say such an interesting relationship our characters have in this we see a genuine change in robb he is becoming the picture of a rebel leader who has the sangfroid to stare down one of the most feared knights in the world and sees the situation for what it is not a complete victory but a strong position that he is trying to leverage for even more gain and doesnt that make what we all know will happen to robb that much more tragic series robb is even more likeable than book robb whereas jaime is clearly rattled by his captivity and by being menaced by a direwolf but by golly he will not let it show and i thought this was a particularly fine acting job by costerwaldau who deftly managed portraying a man who experiences fear and trepidation but doesnt let it color his actions or words at all that was a great scene wellwritten and well portrayed plus  direwolf i hope the rest of season 2 will diverge from the books less than this initial episode"

"legba11",2012-04-02,"yep i think we have seen evidence both ways making cersei moreless evil putting the murder of the bastards on film as opposed to thrown in bit of information which happens off camera certainly puts the evil hat on someone pretty heavily janos slynt directly as a good chunk of the audience will put neds betrayal on lfs shoulders and not even realize it was him too if we find out it was cersei which i think they do in the books via tyrion and varys its hard to say they are softening her image overall she made it clear her love of robert ended on their wedding night which would be at least 9 months before the mysterious crown prince death it seems clear to me that she is the true villain of the books but she doesnt take on that role until book 4 which will likely be season 5 if we are lucky enough to get that far so there is plenty of time for the producers to put her exactly where they want her to be they have clearly fleshed out her character thankfully to be honest i think martin did a very poor job of that in the early books the sopranos conversation with robert last season was a great addition i realize that and roz makes the purists heads explode here and i think the scene with lf was a critical early development point see page 13 if she is your villain she should be deeper than she was in the books jaimes face turn next season is going to be a massive chore for the writers as vince mcmahon knows the best way to due is make sure the audience really hates the person who is opposing them jaime begins game of thrones lower than probably any character in the history of television in season 3 he largely plays the role of hero for the iron throne story line a fully developed cersei will make that turn possible"

"gramblor",2012-04-02,"imo leaving irrelevant throwaway scenes in this episode the whorecathalon out of the show would go a long way to dedicating more time to relevant characters in this case no cressen wasnt a major player at all but a tiny bit more of him for instance imparting the fact that he raised the baratheon boys and looks on them as sons wouldnt have hurt nor taken a boatload of screentime to illustratetake away ros and her stupid scene in the whorehouse which for me actually took away some from the horror of little barras murder and youd have had time for thati see what youre saying and i dont really like the character of ros either but they needed a way to introduce her as the head of the brothel will most likely take over the place of chataya for tyrions escapades later on but also gives a segway into the murder of roberts bastards as much as everyone talks about the brothel scene being horrid and unnecessary it will in fact be pretty important in the long run i think lets not forget that scene was also about 2 minutes of screen time its not like it was 30 minutes of a 55 minute episode"

"Blangadanger",2012-04-02,"first impressionsi thought it was a decent episode which had some nice moments but overall kind of dampened by too much content in too little time initially i was kind of turned off by the littlefinger getting trapped by cersei how is that even possible robb not mentioning his fathers sword in his terms and tyrion taking shae straight to the hands tower she doesnt even get there until the very end of book 3 i thinkpower vs power ehhowever i think i can live with the cerseilf confrontation because it does develop each of those characters a little more for the show i can understand why they want to show baelishs motivations because in the book its all told in flashbacks from catelyns perspective which would be boring tv imho but i think theyre pushing just a little too hard i think the average viewer understands that theres clearly a lot going through baelishs mind as it pertains to the starks i kind of liked the cliche power vs power line since it just shows how naive cersei is about her situation on a second watch i couldnt help thinking that the gardener who witnessed the whole confrontation was varys in disguise but only the book readers would think of thatrobb vs jaimerobb not mentioning his sword seems like a stupid error unless they dont plan on showing it again in the series it played such a prominent role in the first season so i assumed it would show up again this season though i think its sad that theyre just getting rid of cats heated conversation with jaime at the end of book 2 i can forgive the writers since the hbo viewers already know the truth its pretty hard to keep tension going in filmtv for such a long time when it isnt there for the audience in the first place besides the two confrontations s1ep10 and s2ep1 have been nicely done imo i loved the slow pan for the entrance of grey wind the direwolves are starting to feel like important characters on their own it also helps the audience understand the incredible victories that robb has since grey wind plays a big partshae in the hands towertyrion taking shae straight to the tower seems a rather unfortunate choice are they really going to try to force the tension of his hiding her directly into his room its going to be hard to convince the audience that guards cant just march into his tower at any time and find her there perhaps theyre taking that entire chunk of story a pretty significant part of tyrions story in books 2 and 3 and changing it a bit giving shae a more vital role not something i would agree with but im willing to see if it worksdeaths to all stag bastardsthe sex scene was so preposterous everyone at my viewing party just burst out laughing at once i do like that they used that scene to introduce us more to janos slynt the no 1 douchebag in westeros people will definitely remember his face now and it will also serve as more of a moral victory when tyrion approaches him about itto drink first or noeveryone at my party also complained about the poison swap with melisandre but i dont think it really matters that much to the viewers since it lets you know that she is mysteriously powerful in retrospect i think that opening sequence with stannis is probably the weakest of all the characters theyve introduced however i think its somewhat fitting since the audience already has characters its rooting for and their favorite characters all dismiss stannis as unkingly indeed the only main character who seems to support him so far is jaime in a mocking way its probably better that stannis and his witchlike guide have a slow buildup to some big surprises later in the seasonevery actor deserves hisher five minutesi understood why they wanted to include nearly every storyline but it would have made for a better episode if they hadnt the story of bran and dany was particularly rushed and forced and could have been saved until later hopefully its only a big problem in the first episodecersei vs everyonei thought the cersei scenes were all acted very well by headey strangely enough i think the cerseijoffrey confrontation was more powerful than the cerseityrion confrontation the future conversations with tyrion need to have a bit more weight perhaps by slightly slower cuts between crossshots im a little worried they may have made joffrey just a tad too confident if hes so eager to kill off his mother and forget his uncle and grandfather its going to be tough for audiences to believe that tyrion can take over kings landing its still possible but theyve just raised the challenge higherarrys hairi could really tell from the small glimpse of arya that her natural hair looks way better onscreen than the wig she wore at the end of last season sorry hair departmentlets talk animationcgiwise the dragons and direwolves looked wonderful but the kings landing shot from the hands tower wasnt as great the wide shots of the north and the eastern steppes were beautiful the intro showed dragonstone which looked good but not much else changed i think it would be cool to show the location of the armies once theyre on the field because outside of kings landing there isnt much action within cities in the second season"
"Kaitscralt",2012-04-02,"wow i really loved this episode i didnt mind craster or lfcersei i did however feel the scene between daenerys andrhakaro was meant to imply attraction which bothered me but many others here dont see it that way ser dontos weird american armor was a bit distracting everything else i lovedi really liked how much bran resembled shorthair arya when looking at the reflection in the water another nod to the castingit is too bad the stannis stuff was rushed because i am just delighted by how he and davos are being portrayed by their actors a stuff i couldnt stop laughing during the writing of the letter if they continue to emphasize the subtle comedic touches given to stannis in the novels he will totally own season 2the ending scene with the bastards cutting to gendry and arya was perfect gendry looks badass i read a review that the end of the episode didnt deliver enough of a punch not sure how anyone thought thatalso a few people seem to have missed that the kid washing the ground was a little bird for varys edited by kaitscralt 03 april 2012  0713 am"

"Ferrum Aeternum",2012-04-02,"not a perfect episode but a very good start to the season noticeably better in my opinion than last seasons openerhighlights the robbjaime scene may go down as one of my favorites in the entire series when its all said and done masterful work by both actors and tension wound tight as a bowstring thanks in no small part to the dramatic musical cues and teaser camera shots leading up to grey winds reveal as for grey wind himselfwow is all i can say definitely fits the role of the largerthanlife terror of the battlefield stannis mel and davos three of my favorite characters in the books were brought to life on screen largely as id envisioned them thanks to considerable screen presence from all three actors involved dillane in particular captures the brooding harsh badassery of stannis perfectly as far as im concerned jack gleeson continues to shine as joffrey i felt that he carried both his scenes especially the opener which i found otherwise disjointed and clumsy in execution not the actors fault just an odd scene for me the small council scene was very entertaining tyrions barbs cerseis roomclearing fit of anger and varyss reaction to said fit all had me smiling biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd  speaking of cersei ill give lena headey the most improved award through one episode of this season she owned it in the small council and lf scenes and played the joff scene with a good deal of nuance given the shows changes in that dynamic also tyrion wasnt lying  she does look gorgeous pretty amazing what a decent wig can do tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp  the final few minutes were gut wrenching the changes i can live with especially slynt killing barra do you doubt that book slynt would have hesitated for a second before doing the same didnt think so visual effects were largely stunning and all superior to anything presented last season the overhead shot of the red waste was breathtaking a stirring dark soundtrack fit the tone of the episode very well especially during the burning of the gods and the culling of the bastardslowlights as mentioned the opening scene just felt a bit rushed and jumbled not bad overall thanks to the performances but i expected more dontos was as i pictured him but the actor seemed to undersell it ill expect better from him later on oh and  pet peeve  im sick and damn tired of certain characters never getting their names used inscene i guarantee there are plenty of nonbook readers who still had no idea who tommen and myrcella were after that scene cressen having no backstory just flat out doesnt make sense to me there was ample opportunity in his conversations with davos to drop one or two simple lines referencing his past with stannis and the baratheons that wouldve heightened the impact of his death the rest danys bit was fine and fit the tone set in the books well drogon was marvelously rendered hats off again to the special effects folks the scene with rakharo was nice enough but felt forced almost like its setting up some tragic event in a later episode hmm brans brief scenes were good i was pleased to see that the warging sequence was pretty much exactly what id pictured from the books  the nw visit to crasters keep waswell ok craster wasnt exactly what i expected lookswise but the actor did an excellent job being a sleazeball and delivering those biting lines nice to see gilly as well albeit briefly dolorous edd was cool mormonts dressing down of jon was probably my favorite part of this sequence in all solid all around lfcersei  i thought this scene was fine mostly thanks to headeys commanding performance obviously it undercuts lfs character in the show but in this regard the damage was already done with that utterly ridiculous monologue in episode 7 last season at this point it seems as though showlf isnt half as clever as he thinks he is an impression i never got in the books oh well not nearly enough to detract from this episodes strengths"

"Skeksi",2012-04-02,"really enjoyed the episode as a whole first things first good to see that conleth hill made it into the opening credits i wasnt surprised to see the actors playing davos stannis and melisandre making it there too though i was quite surprised to see bronn and shae increased roles for them perhaps or simply a result of tyrions increased presence on the show presumably and their proximity to him the episode was very much introductory catch up with the existing characters in their locations robb theon catelyn and jaime in robbs camp the lannisters in kings landing a bit of bran and daenerys and of course introducing stannis davos and melisandre it wasnt especially fast paced but it worked well at showing the audience the positions of most of the major players at the start of the series i think this as a whole was done well i liked the added scene between joffrey and cersei given the aging of joffrey and the addition of some strategic military competence hinted at in the first season the idea of a standing army loyal to the crown etc it makes sense that he would be seizing charge more readily and be less ready to listen to the advice of his mother especially since he seems to genuinely wonder whether the rumour of her incest is true or not in which case she has put his claim in danger in turn cersei who in the books definitely desires power is likely to be knocked into touch a bit by her son acting this way jack gleeson btw does an awesome job as joffrey i liked the final scene killing the bastards ending on a shot of gendry with arya its quite a dramatic event to end what has been a reasonably slow paced episode picking up the pace nicely as we head into the season proper plus the final shots of arya and gendry serve to not only show arya to the viewers but to remind them of gendrys parentage emphasising that the bastards of robert are at risk and thus that there are guards heading not only after gendry but arya also some nice dramatic set up my major issue is with the littlefingercersei scene i dont feel that it fits with littlefinger as a clever manipulator and i dont think it is necessary to give him a reason to work against the lannisters given that he has already shown willingness to betray for his own benefit and made it clear to the viewers that his sights are set on the highest power which isnt going to mesh with cersei and joffrey in charge it just seems clunky and is a disappointing reintroduction to littlefinger given that it is his only major scene this episode another minor issue i feel that sticking the introduction of stannis and co in the middle of the introductions of established characters on the show might have been a mistake the last season opened with a scene largely unconnected to the rest of the series and i feel that having a similar scene establishing stannis and maester cressen precredits would have worked better preferably followed up by the later scene of the attempted poisoning of melisandre perhaps lengthened to miss out brans first or second scene it doesnt work too badly as it is but given that we are familiar with the rest of the characters i think it would have served better to introduce stannis and co first before the rest of the episode basically obviously a few things have been changed from the series jaimes location the increased role of robb shae being in the tower of the hand from the start im interested to see what they do with ros obviously she appears to have taken on the role of lfs secondincommand at the brothel but whether this leads to her role being to replace alayaya or if she gets a different storyline of her own its something of a relief to see her clothed suggesting that her role might be expanded from sexposition vehicle if theyre going to keep her in might as well make her interesting so in summary a largely good episode that works very well as an opener though might have been a little slow paced if it had been placed elsewhere in the series and picks up the pace nicely towards the end good acting overall one clunky scene and a couple of scenes that could have done with being rearranged are the main complaints a few changes made to the book but other than the aforementioned clunk nothing too jarring series has been set up nicely and i look forward to seeing how some of these changes develop in the next episode i would hope to get introductions to renly brienne and co who are obviously one of the other big group introductions of the series and possibly the greyjoys i would expect at least one scene of showing aryas journey possibly more since she has barely appeared this episode at least one decent varys scene since in the books he plays a bigger role this time around and a better littlefinger scene we will see"

"Ser Kevan Raley",2012-04-02,"some scattered thought on the first episode of season twowhile the show is still pretty darn awesome this felt a tad slow and choppy i suppose the choppiness will remain since the books have several parallel story lines it was only the first book that kept most of them together i loved when tyrion arrived and took charge both of joffrey and then the small council and scolded his sisternice menacing grey wind in cgi i like how robb acted towards jaime and hes growing as a leader  and kingspeaking of cgi that dragon was just too cute for words i want one as a petcraster looked much too clean than i had imagined but hes still a dirty old frakker and was that gilly we saw and that spokestannis is one intentionally bland character hes such a traditional man that i find it hard to believe he just fell for some new fiery religion ive had the same problem with him in the booksthe child actors are very good in this episode i especially liked the performance of isaac hempstedwright as brannot much arya here except a glimpse at the endthe slaying of king roberts bastards were gruesomeso roz is now running littlefingers brothel that was fast work i suppose shell take the place from whatever characters did that in the booksanother needless gratuitous sex scene oh well better get used to itjoffrey is such a complete and utter bastard cersei is an evil witch but i cheered when she slapped him more joffrey slapping for the peoplethe added scene between littlefinger and cersei felt odd i would never think him to be so careless as to challenge her like that hes usually to smart for that so he got what he deserved when she threatened to kill himlena headey looked quite nice herei wonder what theyll do with jaime this season considering hell be in confinement the whole time"
"congokong",2012-04-02,"i cant believe how many of you didnt like the awesome cersei vs littlefinger scene first its definitely not about littlefinger and all about showing how clumsy cersei is at playing the game she finally has a little bit of regency power and she is all to quick to wield it she knows she cant really exercise it over her asshole son so she takes it out on baelish yes booklittlefinger would never show his cards like that but i like that the producers added a little chink in showlittlefingers armor his weak spot is catelyn good to know it also connects the dots for the audience more on why hes going to turn against the lannisters later on we as book readers know what he is but the show audience needs more motivei also like how more tempestuous cersei is this season feels much more like the book character to me she is impulsive and slap happy lena is fully invested in this wonderfully wicked character now and it showswhile cersei certainly would be quick to demonstrate power petyr doesnt really care about catelyn anymore by the start of the books he sends her on a wild goose chase for his own ends and doesnt seem to display any sadness at her death"
"Lord Varys",2012-04-02,"is shireen truly gone i dont think they can do this stannis may very well die eventually and then shireen will be a queen they cant omit her completely even if stannis does not die as i believe this whole greyscale thing will come into play shireen will start an epidemic just as lord jon might do in the south perhaps she is even going to become that stone beast from danys vision the fact that only selyse was seen during the pyre scene is no proof that shireen has been cut she is a child and it was night i guess selyse shireen ser axell lord alester and edric storm who most likely will be introduced as stanniss ward will be cast in season 3 if asos is going to be three seasons stannis will have to talk to somebody on dragonstone who is not mel or davos since there will be not that much scenes on dragonstone this season stannis should leave the island in episode 3 perhaps already next episode so the omission of shireen ser axell etc is something i can live with at least for this season if they are not introduced next season i will be truly pissed just as pissed as i will be if we dont get the tullys hoster edmure and brynden in season 3"

"Hyper",2012-04-02,"i do think its odd how shireenpatchfaceselyse are cut like lord varys says shireen could be a queen one day and the greyscale thing with her and val seemed to have some unknown significance in adwd however grrm has mentioned that he gives the writers a general gist of whats to happen in the future if anything ever happens to him maybe its sort of a stretch but is it possible that grrm told the writers not to worry about them and they basically mean nothing in the long run or maybe the writers are just going to take a different route with it if stannis does ever sit the iron thronewhile we cannot know for sure that grrm doesnt have a big destiny for shireen i think she is a reasonable character to cut they just have to do a lot of cutting  the books have a cast of thousands and they cannot simply keep all smaller characters that people may get attached toas for greyscale she is not the last character in the story to suffer from it many have the disease and others will be able to showcase it we do need patchface and his singing about under the seawhy"
"wolverine",2012-04-02,"my 2 cents sansa was fine the rest of the scene was more awkward imo the whole scene just seemed off it seemed a little ridiculous where they were fighting having reread the books i started to like tyrion more and more the tv series is increasing how much i like tyrion also on the first read i kind of hated him craster was way too civilized in appearance as was his hall but his attitude and acting was spot on i though the ax they gave him was some big intimidating battle ax not the weeny little hatchet he got on the show from what i saw i took that joffrey ordered the executions of the bastards the tv series seems to continually make cersei much less of an evil bitch than she is and i personally dont like that i want all the viewers to hate her as much as she should be hated ros sucks and i am really sick of her i did not like the lf vs cersei scene when i first saw jorah in season 1 i was not impressed but i thinkn he has grown on me and does a pretty damn good job mel was not impressive to me and maester cressens assassination attempt was detestably pathetic i had no idea that was dolorous ed talking to jon sam and grenn"

"koftroy",2012-04-03,"i agree with many of you as i wrote somewhere last night crastor what was uo with that he was described as disgusting more lord freynot so clean cut ghost jon is always with him he is key to his character development where the hell is he jon was not as belligerent at this point as they make him out to be he is my fave character but hotheaded or rash he kinda lost that after they left the wall okay kit harrington is a babe and he plays jon well but he was an okay looking guy but pretty never he is starting to look stronger but this book feature jon prominently he does however have the hard look in his eyes and does not smile just like dad cersei lord baelish what was that about he would never have been that stupid i still hate the way she is portrayed as passive aggressive she was fiercely protective of joffrey who would never have spoken to her that way and she starts to become paranoid and surrounds herself with many not so bright people on the council she was a loud mouthed conniving dangerously manipulative woman this is not who i seeexcept with how she walks around with her little guards the murders of the bastards much like jaimes escape attempt were background noise in the book but it did happen and they chose to show it great segway into arya btw who remember thinks the soldiers want her but it is gendry they are looking for direwolves look amazing i liked brans dream and my fave moment is when he looks at the reflection and for a minute it looks like arya good move as we know she has the wolf dreams as well sansa is sansa yes she acts as a prisoner  beaten into submission but she has figured out how to act she is not bright enough to ever be as strong as the other starks tyrion perfection and how gorgeous is croatia i also find it interesting which is why tyrion asked where he was on the battlefield how joffrey is the least king of them all all he does is torture people and act like a sociopath in a playground given to him by his mother i finally realized after all this timehe does nothing actually featuring robb more prominently was great as we never see his pov he has changed greatly and has grown and i think presently is the only one acting like a future king i really liked how they showed the lines in his face when saying good bye to his mother it shows how quickly his youth has faded oh and i was wondering why he did not ask for ice back either that was weird toothat sword is a big deal finally melisandreshould shine brighter and in the last book we learned she is powerful sees things but does not always know what they ate she makes educated guesses also lightbringer shined because of that green stuff remember jon knows it is fake and i think stannis does too but i wrote about that in my blog so that is it"

"DaveSumm",2012-04-03,"gotta agree that stanniss scene should have opened the episode the tyrion arrival scene while fine by itself felt more like wed just returned from commercials and we were midway through the episode it really wasnt a season opening scene plus the confusion mentioned from the nonbook viewers regarding who mel davos and cressen were would have been vastly softened if it was a precredits i dont think anyone expects to fully understand an opening scene like that just as waymer  co at the start of season 1 was unconnected to anything plus i cant think of any reason not to reshuffle the episode to implement this other than they just panicked about opening with unfamiliar faces and bottled it this episode was essentially setting up character arcs so even though it wasnt the best episode by itself ill gladly accept this for the pay off of a more thorough telling of the meat of acok i havent compared it with book pages but it certainly felt like more than a tenth of the book was covered crasters keeps done danys already sent off her bloodriders the city guard are off after gendry already so i have every hope it will be a great season"
"Haymaker",2012-04-03,"dont get some of the hate i see for the little fingercersei scene lf has the same type of back and forth quips with varys as seen mutliple times in season 1 so its not a stretch that he would have some type of comeback to cersei who threw the first quip at him to the content of his jab back at cersei the incest is a well established rumor at this point so its not some coveted information he has he is just indirectly telling a known rumored embarrassing story about cersei as cersei did to him the only stupid thing he did was underestimate cerseis power which was the point of the entire scene with that said i also liked how they ended the epsiode with the bastard purge this event is a major catalysts as it has a profound effect on aryas eventual journey so it felt right that hbo played it up in order to justify the hunt for gendry only negative as other have mentioned is the cressen poisioning just too rushed ever since reading acok over the summer i pictured that prolog from the book being a perfect opening to season 2"

the stage even if that did give some viewers the feeling that it was jumping around too much id expect that to settle down in future episodesnice to see dragonstone in the opening credits however the design of it was all wrong but then none of the artists have gotten anywhere close to depicting it correctly either not their fault since george has never really provided an adequate description of the place at worldcon last year he spoke about how dragonstone is a dragon shaped castle created by the magic of the valyrians who could mould stone like clay its not just a castle covered in dragon statues it is a stone dragon but thats a minor detail not worth being disappointed aboutbut there was much to be disappointed with in this episodelittlefinger and cerseiput me firmly in the camp of hating this scene ive already posted in the other topic about this so i wont repeat myself here but those who are trying to defend this scene please explain why this will not completely change the dynamic between these two characters and the way they interact in every scene from now on cersei knows that littlefinger is perfectly aware of who joffreys father is how could she ever trust him again or for that matter allow him to go on breathing at all cersei destroys threats and petyr has now revealed himself to be a considerable threat with no room to doubt it whatsoever this scene does not make sense even within the context of the tv show and the different characterisations thereincrasterits not only the way he looks i have a big problem with the way he talks it sounds like he was reciting shakespeare rather than the creepy as fuck wildling he was meant to be robert pugh is a great actor but he has been woefully miscast here i agree with others who say craster should have been very much like lord frey have to say i dont recall the physical description of craster from the books those who point out he should be well built are probably right but i may have ignored that while reading and imagined someone else anyway clearly im not alone in that ill go further and say that david bradley who played walder frey in season one should have been cast as craster with someone older cast as walder frey the character is supposed to be in his 90s after all maybe robert pugh should have then been cast as someone else as well wyman manderly perhapsburning of the sevenif i hadnt known from the books i dont believe i would have understood what was going on here not enough information conveyed in my opinion larry williams and many other nonreaders were confused about it and i dont blame them just one line about how it was disrespectful to burn the seven and adopt the red god would have cleared that up while on the subject of dragonstone i almost wish they had cut maester cressen out altogether if they were not going to do his story proper justicethose were the worst parts of the episode before continuing with minor complaints i want to list the good bits that i really enjoyedgrey windthis was the first properly awesome moment of season two i think it looked great a big improvement on the little friendly puppies they used last year well worth the effortdontos hollardyes i know they got the coat of arms wrong and i agree he did not appear drunk enough but i did fear they were going to cut the character out completely so i was glad to see him i think some others who have already written the actor off as bad should hold back their judgement till we see him again i completely disagree with those that said sophie turner was off she got it just right in my opinion also nice to see lothar brune get a mention i expect there are some book readers out there who dont know who lothar brune is i hope hell get a mention again in the correct place rather than the name being used just because they needed onetyrionpeter dinklage was great in every scene as he always isstannis and davosi think liam cunningham is perfectly cast as davos great job pity there was no mention of his luck in this episode but im sure that will come in a future episode stephen dillane also did a great job as stannis the scene where he is making changes to the letter did a perfect job of explaining who this character is and why he is not loved by the people all the best scenes stick closely to the source material and this one was almost verbatim until we got to the cressen bit tacked on the endinfanticidei had been wondering what they were going to end this first episode with and i think this was the exact right choice it definitely makes things clearer to the viewer than it would have been if the goldcloaks had just simply turned up looking for gendry without having had these scenes first the ending definitely worked even though it meant we didnt really get to see arya in this episode i will be interested to see whether they include the confrontation between lommy greenhands and arry in the next episode what with arry not having the wooden sword after maisie kept forgetting to pick the wooden sword up during the filming of the pointy end scene and they ran out of time to go for another reshoot as they lost the light but then i think the scene from the last episode of season one may have been intended to replace that anywayright then back to the gripingdaenerysnot disappointed with dany at all just certain details the horse dying rather than doreah i think they should have replaced doreah with someone else if they want to keep the character around i guess they can just use any old horse for her when she reaches yunkai but hopefully it will still be silvery white as mentioned the moment between dany and rakharo we totally dont need a romance subplot there another little detail i didnt like here was the fact that she was not following the direction of the red comet in fact it looked like they were going in the opposite direction to where the comet was pointing and then sending the riders out and one goes northeast northeast i know this is such a minor irrelevant quibble but couldnt they have got the directions rightros and sexpositionthis is exactly the kind of scene we dont need in this show pointless nudity and gratuitous simulated sex for no reason whatsoever ros parroting littlefinger from the single worst scene of season one just reminded me of how awful that was and soured this scene as well a double strike of crappiness in one if the show runners want to avoid being called teenage masturbatory fantasy then stop putting in scenes like this totally unnecessaryi disagree with the theory that ros is taking over for chatayaalayaya in the show because if shae remains in the red keep and i hate that idea too then there is no need to include those characters at all perhaps we will see shae moved to her manse in episode two and they just did not want to take the time to establish that this episode but if not then i dont understand how cersei could be in any doubt as to who tyrions whore is there would be no hiding her which brings me on toshaei still really dont like hboshae very unlikeable character i dont think i will ever understand why she was completely rewritten not sure why they even stuck with the same name since it is clearly a totally different character ughor maybe thats the point and we only see bookshae through tyrions eyes and she is lovely and sweet and calls him her giant of lannister but i highly doubt it this hboshae is challenging rude arrogant petulant greedy manipulative and cold she could never call him her giant of lannister and make it be convincing enough that he almost believes itepisode lengththis episode felt extremely short i believe the running time was 50 minutes or maybe less the four advert breaks sky atlantic included didnt help at all methinks we were spoiled by having just the one advert break during the premier of each episode last year i hope those extra minutes are going to be taken and used in some of the later episodes where the need a bit more running time for those who said that all episodes were about that long in season one no they werent winter is coming ep 101 was 62 minutes many of the other episodes came in at 55 minutes or so but they were fairly variable in length the north remembers was noticeably shorter than any episode of season onei know all this sounds like i really disliked the episode but then i nearly always do on first watch with each rewatch i will like it a little more until i make my peace with the changes and accept it though i still believe this will rank as my least favourite episode of the show so far"

"Ikurai",2012-04-03,"hello guys i am new to this forum in fact this is my first post however seeing that this isnt an introduction forum i will jump straight into the topic i know i am new here and i would appreciate it if someone would let me know when i saydo something wrong i am not rude in general but am rather opinionated hope i dont step on anyones toes on the first day ok so about the episode two things struck me in general  as im sure it struck everyone else who watched it namely the littlefingercersei scene and the killing of all the bastards obviously it deviated a little from the books here  however i wonder if it did so for a reason we know that the producers of the tv series have had chats with martin and know roughly how the series ends did they perhaps use these small deviations as characterbuilding exercises from the very beginning as they dont have the luxury of a 100 page pov in the sixth book revealing a new side to a character the littlefingercersei scene has been talked about here a lot a lot of people feel it deviates considerably from how lf actually behaves  cold and calculating however he only fired at cersei with a veiled threat after cersei quite imprudently poked at the catelynlf story we know that lf despite his cunning and brilliance still shows human feelings where catelyn is concerned we know from various references in the books that he did love her and it isnt as strange as some people are making it out to be that he lost his temper when cersei probed at the subject to be fair she probably did poke at it to see if he has even a sliver of allegiance to catelyn left and through catelyn  the starks why is it so strange that petyr made a mistake we know he duelled with eddard starks older brother i forget his name sorry to win catelyns hand that was not well calculated and might well have resulted in his death so despite his qualities he is prone to make mistakes when she is concernedinvolved perhaps martin will reveal a more human side to him later when dealing with sansa and were just being told that lf isnt always cold and can feel real emotion when certain people are concerned secondly i thought the killing of all of roberts bastards was extremely significant it did happen in the books but they made a point of making it very very obvious i cringed when they were killing baby barra what possible import could this hold well think about it we know robert left no trueborn heir we know renly dies soon we know stannis will probably die at some point as him taking the iron throne is a longshot at best  and he isnt likely to let someone else sit there in peace if hes alive and from vals comments about stanniss daughters grey scales we get a premonition that she will die too all of these are guesses i totally grant you but it does leave a possibility that the entire of the baratheon line will be ended apart from gendry now assuming the rlj theory is correct and that jon and danaerys somehow get on the throne due to aegon being a blackfyre someone will still need to be the lord of wherever the baratheons are the lords of so while i dont see gendry becoming a king i can totally see him being a lord as the last of the baratheon line so to conclude a lot of ifs and buts are there but assuming there was a reason behind the two scenes being added we may be heading towards a particular ending they may have been there for just fanfare however other than this the episode really was slow at points and really needed a kick in the butt to get it going i suppose having to introduce so many characters will do that to you look forward to a far more riveting season 2 ohh btw i sometimes use caps in my writing i know they are usually used to scream but i assure you this is not my intent i just use it to put stresses on some words  like we do while we actually talk i will stop f it offendsbothers anyone"
