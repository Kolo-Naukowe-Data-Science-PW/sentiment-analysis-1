"Ran",2012-05-13,"whatd you think"
"Greyjoy67",2012-05-13,"for sheer entertainment 910 again  its just so gripping even if youve read the books this series has really gone up a notch in the second half so far i dont feel too strongly about the changes because theyve been relatively well written in alton dying worked pretty well that was a strong scene in fact this was the first episode where id say almost every scene was acted absolutely superbly perhaps one too many ygrittejon scenes but im glad theyre developing that relationship i have a real thing for ygritte  shes uh feisty winkpng classbbcemoticon alt  she reminds me of girls from scotland where im from so thats probably why i again loved tywinarya even if they need to get moving a bit with that storyline qarth worked out well i just dunno what happened really it was wonderfully creepy though theon gets a again um what else yeah no i couldnt find much to complain about im sure a bunch of you will though haha"
"Wyman_Manderly",2012-05-13,"did not care too much for the cersei tyrion scene liked the jaime scenes though 810 i kind of liked what they did with qarth it was lot better than what i was expecting it to be edited by wymanmanderly 13 may 2012  0927 pm"
"Arlborn",2012-05-13,"oh my god i loved it best episode of the show so far i am an avid book reader and i had to use my first post to post here i loved it so much the ending specially oh my even though i am a book reader it still gave me all sort of feelings watching those bodies all i could think of was how awesome it was and oh the scene showing harrenhall in all its haunting and ruined glory best visual scene this show had so far gosh awesome i loooved what they did about qarth too jeez and the scenes with jaime wow just wow blown away oh god i think im having an orgasm right here i just loved it did i mention that i loved it yet edited by arlborn 13 may 2012  0935 pm"
"Tewks44",2012-05-13,"this was perhaps the first episode where i thought the changes were actually good and since they dont appear to be having any long term diversions from the book i think itll all wind up okay"
"Kyrion",2012-05-13,"the coup of qarth was awesome but also a little alarming just like that they could take over qarthwell he is a warlock also didnt like the change to jon getting captured dont see how they will get to the qhorrin halfhands part still overall awesome episode 910"
"shaggydork",2012-05-13,"good 710 although a step down from last week the jonygritte scenes were a little slow im becoming disappointed with the northofthewall settingtoo barren aryatywin scenes were outstanding as usual i am totally buying his interest in her although its superficially unlikely im enjoying qarth and danys story in general more than i did in the books but dany herself is coming across as a bit too crazy i get that theyre playing up the coin flip targaryen sanity but i think it might be hurting the character"
"jasonresno",2012-05-13,"the coup of qarth was awesome but also a little alarming just like that they could take over qarthwell he is a warlockalso didnt like the change to jon getting captured dont see how they will get to the qhorrin halfhands partstill overall awesome episode 910im assuming the halfhand gets captured as well and jon and qorin will be ordered to fight eachother qorin then gives him his final command i could see it working out alright"
"Ferrum Aeternum",2012-05-13,"810 again not perfect in particular i thought the final reveal of bran and rickon was handled a bit clumsily considering its importance but a lot of nice touches throughout and the best exposition this season quick impressions  apart from the end theons story was again handled in top notch fashion ill admit despite my disdain for theons character that i was quite amused by his kicking the shit out of black lorren lold at the preceding dialogue  the giant musta took em giant you mean hodor biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd   loved all the stuff at robbs camp including talisas reaction when robb wants to take her to the crag methinks a certain lady westerling hasnt quite been forthcoming with king robb biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd  the jaimealton scene was fantastic because it succeeded in drawing me into the notion that it was just a long expository scene then wham well played dd  satisfied to this point with the qarth story  the truth of my prediction shared by several other boarders that xxd was behind the dragon theft at least in part was no great surprise the wanton murder of the thirteen definitely was im eager to see how this gets resolved  the sandorsansa scene was ok albeit rushed  tywin lannister is not a moron at least not a complete one he knows arya is highborn and i suspect given milordmy lord has known all along since apparently ty will be leaving harrenhal next week that little plotline is about to come to an end  again excited to see what happens btw  speaking of harrenhal that establishing shot leading into tys window was fantastic a to the cgi folks  quaithe fun little scene although im ready to see her speak with dany directly  another fun little scene was branrickonhodorosha  jon  ygritte was fine but a little long and drawn out could have done with one fewer scene of them wandering around in the snow now we can be reasonably certain that jonqorin wont go the same as in the books again not too happy about that but well see what happens this episode definitely had that setup feel to it which is fine so long as the payoff works is it next sunday yet"
"nothatso",2012-05-13,"mostly enjoyed it but i dont like how they essentially skipped the sequence where jon gets his scar and finds mances camp it reeked of budget issues"
"NedFlanderStark",2012-05-13,"i dont feel too strongly about the changes because theyve been relatively well written inthis the acting wsa amazing this episode as well"
"Died a Hero",2012-05-13,"a strong nine the north scenes were great you know nothing jon snow im not sure how theyre going to handle the halfhand turn but well worry about that when the time comes i really liked that tywin made arya eat from his table knowing that someone was trying to kill me and that shes a highborn from the north somewhere was a very understated touch jamies scenes were the best of the season all youll have to do is die very jaime the story he told about ser barristan the bold was handled well even danys scenes were good if not a little stiff this week but i cant blame her with all the crap writing theyve tossed her way this season its a miracle she remembers how to act at all the overthrow was a cool add on they over foreshadowed the two miller boys but most fans who havent read the book probably still wont pick up on it that being said theons stuff this week was great all and all one of the better shows this season only five has been better and next weeks looks cool the back half of this season is standing up well just like last year edited by died a hero 13 may 2012  1032 pm"
"Ferrum Aeternum",2012-05-13,"rewatching and wanted to add one thing  emilia clarke was outstanding in this episode especially in the scene with jorah"
"Sand11751",2012-05-13,"too much jon  ygritte  her voice just annoys me wouldve been nice to see qhorins last instructions to him but maybe they could still put that scene in with jon forced to make a choice in front of the wildlings no idea what the hound is doing in sansas room after she has her first period  is he gonna teaching her about periods now  glad jaimes conversation with his cousin finally came to a point cause up that i was thinking wtf but compared to the conversation he could have had with catelyn about aerys it just seems ridiculous this was a five or six tonight only for that conversation between cersei and sansa"
"tfoxx22",2012-05-13,"i really enjoyed this episode just not as much as some of the last couple definitely an 8 or 9 though"
"_Oberyn_",2012-05-13,"9 one of the few good episodes this season no idea whats hapeing with jon now more pointless changes i was sad to see the spice king go he was the only good thing the tv show introduced i was hopping he would play a part as a yunkai envoy in the future"
"Pinn",2012-05-13,"even danys scenes were good if not a little stiff this week but i cant blame her with all the crap writing theyve tossed her way this season its a miracle she remembers how to act at alli would have preferred a little more of the subdued and tempered confidence that she has gained from believing in herselfa strength she uses in allaying any doubts she may have to herself while shielding them others around her it is that strength that has carried her and maintained her very loyal core of followers thus far i think the directing has made her a little too shrill and disempowered compared to my take of her from the booksjon  ygritte  i think the idea is to try to build some chemisty here hence the longer scenes"
"Prince of Dragonstone",2012-05-14,"really surprised to be enjoying ygritte on this show 100 due to the actress abilities i loathed that character in asos i thought her relationship with jon was a contrived plot pointone of grrms only missteps in the series but the actress playing her on the show might save this character for me and bring her into a new context i love the chemistry she has with jon in the books i was a bit relieved when she died but the show might actually have me bawling when she goes who woulda thunk it"
"Lord Ravenfrost",2012-05-14,"i think the episode was good save for too much jon and ygrette time i continue to love theons story most of which is ripped right from the book for the most part im glad they made a mention of the brotherhood without banners although they couldve let nonreaders know a little more about them other than they annoy lord tywin especially when tywin was complaining to the mountain about them attacking the fringes of their army spoiler something to the effect of lord beric cant be killed or lord beric and that damned red priest are like ghosts the qarth scene sort of took me by surprise where the thirteen died in a good way although i think dany is too bratty for my taste i like how they handled her dragon disappearance spoiler it will make more sense down the road for nonreaders when xaro shows up in meereen representing qarth i still cant see why someone would want to avoid reading the books but to each his own the robb stuff is starting to come into focus and i can see why so much time was spent on it i dont like how they are handling jons story but it looks like it will end up happening the same way it does in the book i still think grrms version of things is better but whatever i really think ghost should be with him more too but i guess that it costs too much to put him in most of the scenes they need to give the show more money so we can see more of the dragons and the wolves they are just as important as any of the side characters i gave it an 8 edited by sword of the late night 14 may 2012  1222 am"
"FacelessDude",2012-05-14,"overall an ok episode i was looking forward to jon letting ygritte go and then havin jon meet back up with quorin halfhand and the rest of the rangers the chemistry between jon and ygritte happened more in sos but i enjoyed their scenes together it really hit me when she said you know nothing jon snow the actress who plays ygritte is pretty and feisty they did a good job on theons character arc i liked how they mixed black lorren with the guy that was killed in cok by theon when raiding the fishing villages so they combined that well i also liked the look of emotion on theons face when he sees the bodies of bran and rickon priceless they do a great job of replicating the book version of theon"
"7V3N",2012-05-14,"im assuming the halfhand gets captured as well and jon and qorin will be ordered to fight eachother qorin then gives him his final command i could see it working out alrightthats what i think too though i like what happens much more in the book"
"Michaelj",2012-05-14,"i really enjoyed this episode i give it 95 was still quite shocked of the ending and what jaime lannister did"
"BoldAsYouPlease",2012-05-14,"810 best episode of the season for me good remarkably good scenes by the actors playing the lannister twins of all the cast the actor playing jaime comes closest to how i envisioned the characters and he made the most of some very substantial scenes in this episode cersei is actually something of an improvement over the book version at this point  shes more of a fully realized woman than bookcersei and her obvious realization of what joffrey is and her guilt over her part in creating him were quite effective dinklage didnt have much to do but he conveyed tyrions essential nature as he sought to comfort his sister  decent just as he described myrcella and tommen dance and maisie williams were again interesting and it was a relief to finally see lord tywin impose some limits on the amount of presumption he was willing to put up with from a serving girl bad more pointless and annoying squawking by dany bad writing but the actress is also just not very strong why would anyone ever follow this daenaerys dragons or no pyat pree appears to be insanely overpowered  with such abilities he should have taken over all of westeros and essos long ago the jonygritte scenes became tiresome enough to negate the beautiful northern scenery there really is no suspense to theons reveal of the two child corpses  no one believes bran and rickon are dead the sacrificiallamb status of the winterfell refugee boys was telegraphed too blatantly oh and im really really sick of the robbtalisa nonsense edited by boldasyouplease 14 may 2012  0123 am"
"drigoly",2012-05-14,"best episode so far in this season my first 8 if it werent for the supermen quarth shit with pyat pree i would have given it a 9 not gonna give a 10 till i see blackwater so 9 is my highest for all the other episodes tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp   love the changes they did with the arya chapters in harrenhall smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  edited by drigoly 14 may 2012  0139 am"
"Direwolf Lager",2012-05-14,"doing a great job with the winterfell storyline even without the reeds however im disappointed with how weak theyre making daenerys look theyre giving her a bit too much of the targaryen madness also interested to see how the changed jon snowqhorin halfhand conflict plays out"
"Direwolf Lager",2012-05-14,"also not enjoying the portrayal of tywin lannister hes supposed to be the most feared man in the seven kingdoms but hes coming off as a big softy"
"rmholt",2012-05-14,"i gave it a 10  before it was even over  for the tywinarya exchange for the line of ygritte did you pull a knife on me for the jaime escape and recapture and finally for tyrion being so ocd about tactics v strategy"
"The Knight of Flours",2012-05-14,"not quite a 10 but the best of s2 so far 910"
"rmholt",2012-05-14,"810 againloved all the stuff at robbs camp including talisas reaction when robb wants to take her to the crag methinks a certain lady westerling hasnt quite been forthcoming with king robb biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd omg of coursethe jaimealton scene was fantastic because it succeeded in drawing me into the notion that it was just a long expository scene then wham well played ddme toothe sandorsansa scene was ok albeit rushedthis relationship has been so sluggish but is picking up some steam the cerseisansa scenes really hew to the book  she is at once sansas best friend and worst enemy tywin lannister is not a moron at least not a complete one he knows arya is highborn and i suspect given milordmy lord has known all along since apparently ty will be leaving harrenhal next week that little plotline is about to come to an end i am seeing it as a puzzle tywin is diverting himself with and peeking around the fourth wall we get a lot of information by spying on tywin during this time which was pretty distant in the book it tickles me they used the mlord thing bc i caught at once that she was doing the my lord and thought it was a mistake  and just now in adwd have reread this little lesson roose gives to theonreekjon  ygritte was fine but a little long and drawn out could have done with one fewer scene of them wandering around in the snowi think the actors felt the same way although a candidate for line of the week was in that first scene it was apparently a vehicle for giving us a little lecture on the wildling culture and north historyit next sunday yeti knowah"

"rmholt",2012-05-14,"they do a great job of replicating the book version of theondoes anyone know offhand  did the actor lose some weight between starkness and ironness"
"rmholt",2012-05-14,"dear david nutter i can barely pick the dialogue out of the accents and fasttalking please do not have arya talk with her mouth full of turnips tia"
"salt",2012-05-14,"the first 10 ive given out of the season perhaps it deserves a 9 but the theres not much fish left in you line pushed me over the edge"
"Kvothe_ModTech",2012-05-14,"there was a few good moments but overall this is the first episode that has really annoyed and disappointed me i feel as though they have ruined jons storyline if they dont make it that halfhand gives him the command then i will be thoroughly pissed off i loved the scene with tywin and arya they are great together dany just seems off i dunno she was really good in the first season but has been underutilized this season very disappointing i dunno just didnt feel this episode maybe i wish it was closer to the books to much"
"Envie",2012-05-14,"so many deviations from the books but so far most of those deviations are working in favor of the story very well i was really concerned how they writers would condense so much detail into short one hour episodes without losing the intensity we all loved in reading those details it seems like they have an excellent handle on how to keep the story moving in the more or less same direction as the book while at the same time fleshing out some great dialogue and character development we didnt have from the book the arya  tywin pairing has been absolutely phenomenal theres no way it could have been as good if theyd kept it as it was in the books with her working the kitchens or for roose bolton so glad to see jaime lannister back at the forefront of the story once again after a long departure from his part in it due to being a captive the surprise with that long exposition scene was definitely a shocker and well done reminds everyone that jaime is still a very dangerous man even in chains i am a jon snow fan what female reader isnt cmon and i approve of the reworked ygritte character i found her annoying as hell in the book and was disappointed when he started to fall for her theyve done a much better job making her feisty and attractive than my impressions of the girl in the books plus her constant antagonism of jon and how the nights watch are a bunch of sorry idiots without women with your hands then  no wonder youre all so miserable  well that was just pure gold i enjoyed the dramatic twist on the qarth plot line it was a real snoozefest to me in the books except when dany went in the house of the undying so adding this crazy drama is pretty good plot manipulation to keep danys story interesting pyatt pree is insanely creepy and believable if not a little too powerful with his illusions i also loved the interactions between cersei and sansa  makes her much more believable than she was in the books a lot of people dont like how shes been turned into the worrisome mother figure but i for one appreciate the more realistic take on iti think theyre doing a good job trying to keep the audience tied in to her storyboth pitying her hating her and even admiring her at times tyrion and cersei are now on the same page briefly i think this was done as another illusionary tactic to make viewers think things may turn in favor of the lannisters before blackwater theons story and scenes continue to be amazing amazing amazing ill discuss it in more detail i the other thread as i am too tempted to spoilers i gave this episode a 10 the pace was faster more intense and left almost every scene  story arc with a cliffhanger setup for next week edited by envie 14 may 2012  0359 am"
"LostSoul",2012-05-14,"i am alittle disappointed i must admit i was really hoping we would see the scenes of the undying and how they portray the prophesies now we are going to have to wait next week for it love tywin and arya scenebrilliant piece of acting by both actors i do like how they taking the storyline with dany cant wait to see next weeks episode i gave it 710"
"Lord Rickard Snow",2012-05-14,"im simply amazed on how well they can keep the story straight on the tv showwith the massive narrative the books offer its a seemingly daunting task with tvs time budget and monetary constraints props to dan and db for putting an amazing show together and i can only hope and im sure i speak for most people who enjoy the show well have many many more seasons of the show i enjoyed the arya tywin scene i thought it was well captured the shot of tywins neck right out of aryas mind like were watching her thoughts well shot could someone please get maester luwin a tissue and tell him its ok theyre only a little crispygreat scene and end to the episode just like the books always leaving you wanting a little bit more thanks for reading my pov and my first post on this forum"
"The Anti-Targ",2012-05-14,"ok if this is how jons story plays out ill consider this a very strong episode almost worthy of a 9 the band who has surrounded jon is relatively small so qhorin et al descend on them to rescue jon ygritte escapes with a few wildings jon joins back up with the halfhand and takes all sorts of shit from his brothers then ygritte returns with a much bigger troop of wildings and were back to how things play out in the book i need jon and qhorin to have that conversation if that doesnt happen it will be the biggest disappointment of the season what gives me hope is that ep 8 is grrms episode eta no its not ep 9 is ok so maybe the convo happens in ep 9 hopefully he insisted on being the one to write that scenei thought cersei coming out and actually admitting to tyrion that the kids are children of incest was going too far cersei may turn to tyrion as the only adult family she has but shed never fully let her guard down like that it doesnt sit right with the nature of their relationship especially with her attitude and deep seated loathing of tyrion of course it does probably segue into cersei being a complete bitch to tyrion next episode and she has all the more reason to be all out nasty because she showed a moment of vulnerability to him still i do not approve of the admissionking of qarth and murdering 11 of the 13 did they need to go there not sure it certainly ramped up danys jeopardy and pyat pree is certainly all sorts of unsettling drives dany into desperation and urgent need to move on and ultimately to head to slavers bay so a mixed bag in qarthgood ending with jaimecatelyn and theon and the effigies i think they did a bad job with the paper mache dummies for bran and rickon ok ive never seen a tarred body before but they even seemed to lack heft hanging on the ropes so they just screamed out fake so kinda took me out of the scene a tad great expression on theons face though so a very strong finish pretty sure the noobs will see the bait and switch though too many clues in the episode still theons expression at the end will give people pause wondering where the truth lies810 from me edited by the antitarg 14 may 2012  0425 am"
"Isy",2012-05-14,"one of the best episodes so far absolutely gripping twith interludes of poignant backstory some very memorable scenes nice amount of time with each set of characters changes to quarth are brilliant jon snow changes first half good last scene too much of a change potentially 910"
"Sun",2012-05-14,"what an ending the episode fully deserves the 9 i gave it for that ending choreography alone and the music for that last scene was just perfect the string movements mimicked the palpitating beats of my heart as i saw those two small charred bodies and then theons face tremendous job by the directer and editori absolutely love the changes to qarth for the first time since the book 1 im finding danys arc interestingthe one thing i disliked about this ep was jaime killing alton dramatically i completely see why they did itit makes karstarks need for revenge against jaime much more plausible and defensible than the booksit returns to his character an agency thats been stripped away by him sitting in a cell all season after all jaime is a dangerous and the audience needed reminding of itit makes his future awakening of conscience and briennes affect on him far more powerful and poignantit makes catelyns choice to release after she hears about her boys more logical now that she has reason to believe that robb will no longer be able to guarantee his safetyso i cant really justify my dislike for this particular change except perhaps in being a true jaime fangirl i take any change to his character no matter how slight or justified with the prickliness of a nun invited to tea in a brothelim also sorry for the changes to jaimes conversation with cat the shit for honor chapter is my favourite of all the books containing what is imo the best dialogue scene that grrm ever wrote what i saw tonight didnt hold a candle to the written word thats not to say that show scene didnt work it did its just that it could have been so much better im still hoping well get more of the catjaime conversation as it was in the books next epjon and ygritt are really cute a lot of chemistry there and the sight of the wildings surrounding him on the violetwhite icy hills looked so beautiful and quite intimidating a powerful ending to jons arc this ep and i must just say that the shots of iceland are worth every penny theyve spenta wonderful hour of tv i can now very safely say that over the past 3 episodes got has become the best show on tv right now for meetai forgot to mention robbtalisa much better tonight i thought the first time i watch these 2 together without cringing at the terrible dialogue also theres a decent amount of chemistry coming through suddenly its not so improbably that i might very well enjoy this coupling next seasonalso tywin and arya one of the best scenes of the night world building and character insight in perfect harmony edited by sun 14 may 2012  0533 am"

"OzorxOron",2012-05-14,"would have been a good 8 from me that was until the ending id give it a 9"
"The Meeraculous Third Reed",2012-05-14,"ill go through my usual pros and cons just a disclaimer first some of the rating will be based on the fact that until i see changes enacted in a positive way they are considered slightly negative enough to take off roughly a point pros acting all round it was almost uniformally goodminus imo emilia clarke special shout out to nikolai costerwalder he is jaime likewise i doff my hat to ygritte all the scenes round robbs camp today that storyline finally became worthwhile karstark placed in very well it also now gives us a reason for robb being away from the camp and catelyn when he hears of bran and rickons deaths and subsequently falling into jeynes arms though they did say he was coming back at dawn so that might be delayed an episode either way it was good the death of alton lannister was also very surprising i didnt expect it generally most of the other storylines were good minus a couple that i shall discuss imminently im also adding an extra mark for that shot of harrenhall great great shot cons jon snow is semiincompetent this annoys me he is a future lord commander and he keeps on getting bettered admittedly i get the feeling he may escape next week and as such can reunite with the halfhand in a satisfactory way but still it vexes me also how did ygritte ever get the attention of the wildlings that surrounded jon qarth i dont necessarily mind the dragons being stolen but pyat pree has become some fucking superman and the murder of the rest of the thirteen makes no logical sense also emilia clarkes acting im genuinely torn as to whether she is purposely trying to make daenerys the whiny moron she becomes now or whether its just simple bad acting i hope it does end up that bran et al return to the crypt i want theon to have been properly outfoxed and not just missed them via bad luck also not a con so much as yet to be confirmed but i hope that luwin knows about the bodies the same as he does in the book yara is back next week so i shall give it an 8 overall"
"kailelizabeth",2012-05-14,"910 really great episode the last few episodes have been great as well but this one really hit it out of the park i would have given it a 1010 but danys scenes really blew it for me granted i dont like her much in the books but theyre really dragging her story out this season and it really doesnt help that emilia shouts almost every one of her lines makes me roll my eyes when she shouts im the mother of the dragons for the love of god we know but other than that everything was perfect especially the winterfell scenes alfie allen is doing a great job i didnt think much of him in season 1 but hes blown me away this season"
"TC_Chaos",2012-05-14,"i gave this episode a 10 all the pieces are starting to fall in place for the last 3 episodes and hearing igrytte say you know nothing jon snow reminded me so much of the books"
"ipsuel",2012-05-14,"i gave it an 8 based on tv entertainment value i dont like what they did with jaime fastforwarded thru dany hated her in the books too though and i still dont like the jeyneposingasanother bit  seems unnecessary actually a lot of the changes seem silly to me but i love theons portrayal love the tywinarya combo and like ygritte im worried about certain arcs but ive decided that if i want to enjoy the show i simply cant expect to see the real bookbased story come to life its not gonna happen so im taking the show as a basedinwesteros drama and leaving it at that it gave me a good hour so i gave it a solid 8 "
"Jamie Lannister",2012-05-14,"810 jaimes storyline couldve been expanded a little and that brutal killing of alton was just well the kingslayer was accursed in the eyes of the righteous but the kinslayer the ending was harrowing even knowing what i know"
"Thunderfist",2012-05-14,"i gave the episode a 3 i liked the theon scenes and the scenes with sansashaethe hound i disliked the rest"
"The Monkey",2012-05-14,"good episode 810 the winterfell scenes were great the ending was sufficiently powerful i wonder if nonreaders will be fooled by bran and rickons supposed deaths the harrenhall scenes were great as always glad that tywin is showing some ability to see through aryas lies i like the humanization of cersei great acting from lena headey two points off for the drawn out scenes beyond the wall although i do love the actress playing ygritte and the seemingly omnipotence of pyat pree"
"boojam",2012-05-14,"pretty much condenses what needed it and restructured what needed it for a visual drama i will have to watch it again because i couldnt understand what osha said as she and the bran crew disappeared the whole walnuttheoncleftjaw interchange left me scratching my head as if they were on the trail and they decided  o well we will forget about the boys and display a dead bran and rickon huh figuring that nikolaj has gotten so little screen time this season they had to get something from his salary that sequence must have timed out at one of the longest of the season with really only two episodes to make some kind of closure where the heck are they going with oona chaplin  rose leslie is really good dd really lucked out with their casting department the jon and ygritte bit plays well for the time being it looks as if the story will play out as in the book and george can really improvise on the page for the readers enjoyment but the rest of this story does not make a lick of sense for me it is what it is well  wondered how dd were gonna fix georges rather travelogeee qarth looks like its showdown time at the ok corral  err i mean house of the undying did care for how over dramatic they made the coup datat at the 13 chambers  especially considering the fireworks for dany in storm of swords i hope in seasons 3 and 4 they can get that all in i think we have had interviews with three different actors on the show about lets not overuse the the dragons  well uh how about under using them i think they have been on screen for a total of 30 seconds since e9 may be all taken up with one story sure are gonna be a lot a dragons in e8 and e10 i guess unknown dothraki warrior shows up for a third time edited by boojam 14 may 2012  0643 am"
"rmanoj",2012-05-14,"im normally one to complain about big changes from the books but i actually liked this episode  810 ive come to believe that the more sympathetic cersei is an improvement over the ridiculous book character i hope they never mention maggy the frog and her descent into madness come season 45 will be more effective this way the only points that really annoy me are  casual kinslaying jaime you cant really compare it with lancel or bran alton had done nothing to offend him and posed no threat to him and the escape plan was foolish and never likely to work in the first place as people have been saying this will really make his redemption harder to swallow  jon is still portrayed as far too incompetent and gormless although ygritte was done well  dany was annoying as usual but i dont really pay much attention to her stuff anyway edited by rmanoj 14 may 2012  0705 am"
"WinterWarrior",2012-05-14,"i thought this espisode was ok i gave it a 7 i really felt it was in some ways a tranisition or set up episode for things to come the theon scenes were well done but i really missed having the branrickonoshahodor group hiding in the crypts i am almost positive now they will encounter the reeds on the road also the scenes with jamie were long and somewhat boring but they have to do this to set up the future story line of jaimie and brienne to show how awful a person he is and how he begins to changeand i am not sure what the point of aryatywin is since they did not speak even once in the book why is it important to show this relationship developing on the tv show i cant figure out where that story line is going also  are there only 9 episodes this season hbo said only 2 episodes to goi thought there were 10 this season i like the sandorsansa focus and that makes me optimistic that sansan will continue to be a story line in future books as well as on tv edited by winterwarrior 14 may 2012  0713 am"
"bikie",2012-05-14,"i enjoyed the episode but didnt think it was one of the stronger ones of the season the bran and rickon cliffhanger was too telegraphed and i havent spoken to a nonbook reader that thinks they are dead yet like renlys death i think it should have had a bigger impact on the audience and was not handled properly dany is just as annoying to me in the show now as she was in the books and i didnt feel that way in season one at all as someone pointed out i cant tell if that is the actress method with this character or she is showing some limitations on how to handle dany this season ygritte is fantastic better than i expected from her character though i agree with some others that they are making jon snow way too incompetent while i enjoy the chemistry of arya and tywin immensely i just wonder if that storyline will yield anything significant to the story other than two actors having a great dynamic together ive really enjoyed the season but with everything that happened in book 2 i would have expected a faster pace rather than the character development path they have chosen"
"Chelly",2012-05-14,"810 i liked the episode a lot i just didnt love it as much as last episode still great though the charred little boy bodies of bran and rickon was disturbing you think after the bastard massacre in the season premiere id be a little less shocked by some of the horrible things that happen to children on this show but that visual still disturbed me more jaime more brienne i love brienne telling dudes off and having cats back and gag him i was like lol catelyn is so badass ygritte was too funny and then he said turn around another lol moment the cersei and sansa exchange was very good you wont love the king but you will love his children the women were on point this episode for me i even liked shae helping sansa out and threatening the other handmaid at knife point to not to the queen about sansa getting her period"
"Lord of Cheese",2012-05-14,"yes brans lines were a dead giveaway that they would not be killed very very poor execution no pun intended it should have had teh same impact on tv as it did in the books werent we supposed to have the bastard of bolton in this one i thought the books had a little too much soldier leading the captive now the tv series found a way to add jon and ygritte to that mix sigh but it was an ok episode overall as i didnt feel like raging as much edited by lord of cheese 14 may 2012  0735 am"

"Robin Of House Hill",2012-05-14,"i feel a bit guilty for giving it a 10 because it departed from the book in a number of ways but it was so damned entertaining i enjoyed it the need to compress things into ten onehour episodes means a lot gets left out and that includes some characters while i would have preferred to see certain things that had to be left out there is enough of the book in the series to keep me happy"
"Atreides",2012-05-14,"i thought it was a pretty great episode i wasnt too bothered by catelyn releasing jaime now because she fears that her daughters will die if jaime does a reasonable assumption considering joffrey and cersei and that with robb away karstark is going to succeed in killing jaime before the night is over"

"The Black Wolf",2012-05-14,"great episode gave it a 10 just because i couldnt find a scene that i thought was really bad and most scenes were just plain amazing imo they even managed to make me like shae i love all the kings landing stuff and arya and tywin just blow my mind every time they have a scene together the only things that bugged me this episode were 1 pyat pree being quite overpowered really if he can teleport and be at several different places at the same time why would he even need the help of xxd but still to me its not that much of a big deal 2 still cant get completely on board with this new jeynetalisawhatever probably because i already had my idea of jeyne from the books and i dont manage to fully separate the characters 3 a little too much jon and ygritte for one episode but ill let it slide because i think im falling in love with the actress playing ygritte i found ygritte to be quite annoying in the books at times but on the show shes just great smilepng classbbcemoticon alt "

"Gaius Martell",2012-05-14,"this was probably the best episode in the series so far the show can keep deviating from the book if the changes are of this quality the arya tywin scene the tyrion cersei scene and the qarth scenes were masterfully done theon is doing a great job and the robb jeyne and jon ygritte budding love stories are perfect sandor sansa is marvelous too i cant muster a single complaint"

"BoldAsYouPlease",2012-05-14,"yep he and presumably the other warlocks derive power from the dragons which is why he wants to keep them and dany at the hotu forever a number of clues point to this  in particular quaithes cryptic conversation with jorah in episode 4 has a great deal more resonance now ie dragons are fire made flesh and fire is poweri dont think the magic  dragons formula holds my understanding is that the coming of dragons into the world specifically amplified the firemagic practiced by the followers of rhllor giving them the power to divine the future in fire animate dead flesh and give birth to the smoke monster from lost after all it would hardly make sense for pyat pree and the other warlocks of the world to go to the trouble of learning to practice something which didnt existfor example the magician who castrated varys to summon a demon clearly did so at a time when no dragons existed the others made their appearance in this cycle before the birth of danys dragons bloodraven was renowned as a sorceror merged with a tree and kept his consciousness going for decades with no dragons there doesnt seem to be any evidence that these sorts of nonfire magic have been affected one way or another by dragons and whatever pyat pree is practicing does not seem to be related to fire either  i believe hes had the ability to dominate the world and creep people out long before danys dragons also laughpng classbbcemoticon altlaugh "
"Drogon's Personal Trainer",2012-05-14,"well after all my gushing on earlier episodes i gave this one only an 8  which is pretty decent but i had problems whilst i thought that many scenes were wonderfully done and all those people here who talk about acting the scene where roose bolton had one line and did all the rest with his eyes is what acting is all about sorry i nevertheless come away from this episode feeling a sense of contrivance for the first time i truly felt that i was in a soap opera  hey thats ok i got that feeling from the books too i just found that there was a bit of choppiness again which was like the earlier episodes to start from the beginning throw tar all over me but alfie slipped back in the first scene here after doing so well last week we got the mad rolling eyes and the wooden delivery yet again i forgive him as hes not very experienced and he will soon learn how to do the more subtle nuances nonbrits may not get why i nitpick with this because they are not northern brits so dont feelhear how off his inflections can be but im being ultra strict  theon is still a shit and alfie puts that over pretty well i just got a whiff of melodrama going on  and at the very end  dare i say it  also from the exquisite donald sumpter too who is certainly experienced enough to know better whilst i was in awe of the theon scenes last week i felt they were not among the strongest this time around sorry this isnt an emmy winning performance and it would get nowhere near a bafta nomination the dink and lenas exchange however that scene was beautifully crafted especially with the facial expressions of dink should i comfort her perhaps not again  here we see how good actors can say so much more without dialogue after the words had ended in that scene the silent dialogue went on perfect from the pair of them tywin and arya need no further comment i am glad that tywin made the remark about enjoying his servant girls personality because that was always obvious to me the man is a human being and arya is a character we can all identify with yeah it may be a bit contrived for a tv audience  providing an insight into tywin the human but thats what tv does on a cgi note  the views of harrenhal were magnificent and truly epic the scenes at robbs camp  all were wonderful with the exception of the karstark who was pretty mediocre loved the jaime scenes and have no criticism of them whatsoever once again michelle fairley was brilliant and deserves far more praise than she gets ive read some criticism on this thread about emilia clarke again this is an inexperienced young actress who has flashes of brilliance that can only get better as she ages and gets better roles she reminds me of a young helena bonham carter and how we saw her mature from lady jane through to howards end and beyond ive always managed to see the little subtle changes going on in emilias facial expressions but even so i was expecting the qarth scenes to blow me away after comments id read here they didnt by a long chalk im not sure the writing flowed quite as well as it might have done hmm  how can i put it last series all the essos scenes seemed very real we could believe in the dothraki and the dragons  whatever was thrown at us in this episode for the first time i felt i might have been watching a hokey fantasy show after all still  small mercies and all that at least the annoying spice king is dead nothing wrong with the actor just the character but i just want barristan to get here and fast to add a touch of dignitas to the proceedings i love iain glen to death but was never a jorah fan in the books and although ian has made him more sympathetic he nevertheless manages to convey that tiny air about jorah that we cant fully trust and hes still pretty bloody useless eta jorah i mean  not iain jon and ygritte  these were some of my favourite scenes and especially in the first one we actually got kit to show some emotion which must be applauded biggrinpng classbbcemoticon altd  i didnt cringe when ygritte said the line either she put enough nuance in it to make it sound meaningful i still love this show ygritte the wildlings popping up was done very well  quite unexpected and it worked ive refused to link this episode to the books in any way because ive long since stopped comparing  that way madness lies i just watched it as a tv show in parts it was disjointed but there was enough development within each scene character wise to allow an 8 for overall satisfaction as to bran and rickon at the end  i deliberately wanted my sister a non book reader and experienced thespian herself to see this to see if she was sold by the ruse well the ruse passed her by because she thought the tarred bodies were extremely unrealistic theyre not real bodies she said but who are they supposed to be i asked that old fellas orphans she said so marks off there hbo she never made the branrickon connection at all as a postscript  kudos to sophie turner in this one i thought she was excellent hate to nitpick this time but im trying to be honest there was still so much that was good that ive given it 8 and i cant wait for next week edited by drogons personal trainer 14 may 2012  0540 pm"
"Hour of the Wolf",2012-05-14,"best of the season maybe 3rd favourite of the series i am assuming the last episodes of the season will be very good i havent enjoyed this season at all but this will likely turn it around my biggest question before the season started was how are they going to handle the scene with bran and rickon being displayed in winterfell it was very well done it was at the end of the episode like i thought it would be not a flaying which i could not believe hbo would do but burning is just as shocking luwin and theons reactions really were perfect and it was very emotional for me to see this one of the most memorable moments from the books it is pretty clear what they are going to do with dagmer i am a little disapointed but i am liking the acting of the person playing him so i am fine with the change brienne still does not cut it her impact was small though i am not looking forward to her being more involved in the following seasons jons story is going to be a bit of a surprise i like how it goes in the books so i hope it is still as good i really like the changes in qarth it makes danys story more interesting by spicing up the people around her i look forward to arstans arrival and i wonder how it will be different edit i have to add the wide shot of harrenhal was amazing i gave the episode a 9 edited by hour of the wolf 14 may 2012  0607 pm"

"Ran",2012-05-14,"this ones a 7 while i think qarth is something of a hot mess and im worried about some of the developments in terms of where theyre taking it it felt more like asoiaf than that last episode at least the aryatywin scenes have become repetitive as well and theres some various other bits and bobs that bother me but theres enough solid storytelling  and also some excellent wordforword scenes taken from the novels  that its closer to form still overall the season feels like its underperforming a little yes acok is a more spread out book and not my favorite but their choices to try and streamline it for tv have not been as successful as some of their choices last season under similar circumstancesmy full look at the episode can be found here"

"MegasAV",2012-05-14,"i voted a 7 good episode some great acting and i am enjoying the new story they created for quarth as the books events didnt really captivate me there things i didnt like 1 no stannis or davos seven episodes in and i dont think the non reader has any idea who these men are no mention of the feared battle commander that stannis is nor of any of his backstory which i think really adds to his character 2not a fan at all of the new mountain physically huge but not imposing in any way also the dialogue between him and tywin regarding finding the bwb really bothered me i mean the mountain in the book made a point in got about plucking out the eyes of outriders and twin was questioning his brutality seriously 3seven episodes in and clearly not enough has been done in the sansa sandor storyline what type of emotion is a non book reader to feel when sandor shows up in her room after blackwater battle i think thus far they have had maybe ten mins screen time together overall thus far this season has been good but nowhere near as good as the first season in my opinion"
"duncanthemedium",2012-05-14,"9 loved ygritte love to hate theon and its great what theyre doing both with jaime and dany sorylines absolutely loved the scene between tywin and arya they are setting up some things well i mean danys storyline is so much more wonderful in this timelinecall me a heretic but this dany story is better than the original i wonder where the sansashae alliance is going they might be looking to explain what shae did to tyrion later the whole karstark thing was wellhandled this explains that incident with much economy as well as giving good ol nikolai some screen time roose bolton is not creeping me out enough though all in alli wish every day was sunday"

"Zach H",2012-05-14,"solid 8 jaime continues to really bring to mind the character i envisioned even with stuff not from the novels wonder if nonbook fans kind of forgot about him up until now though despite the various mentions throughout the season ygriite actress nails the character as well although the constant sex talk while wandering the wasteland kind of distracted in an its hbo manner maybe the book was like that as well been so long since i read it i cant remember i dug the cerseityrion scene nice to see the two characters letting their guards down a bit and just talking establishing shot of the wrecked castle with arya and company was amazing"
"Warden of the North121",2012-05-14,"i gave it a 9 the last three episodes have been excellent imo danys scenes were both shocking and exciting a major improvement from her cok storyline jon and ygritte was really enjoyable as well though they maybe could have had one less scene i saw qhorin captured with jon for a second in the promo for ep 8 so their storyline at its core will be the same jaimes scenes were incredible except for killing altoncleos which was a little jarring but you have to remember that this is preredemption jaime who doesnt give shit about morals minus 1 for killing alton aryatywin is again very entertaining and provided a good historical monologue as well as a bwb reference it looks like they go their separate ways next episode which is probably for the best because it is starting to get a little stale tyrioncersei was very touching and humanized cersei a little bit which i dont mind that much sansas scenes were very well acted but her scene with the hound seemed a little rushed theons scene at the end was heartbreaking even though i obviously knew it wasnt bran and rickon edited by warden of the north121 14 may 2012  0758 pm"

"Hedge Lawyer",2012-05-14,"for sheer entertainment 910 again  its just so gripping even if youve read the books this series has really gone up a notch in the second half so fari dont feel too strongly about the changes because theyve been relatively well written in alton dying worked pretty well that was a strong scene in fact this was the first episode where id say almost every scene was acted absolutely superbly perhaps one too many ygrittejon scenes but im glad theyre developing that relationship i have a real thing for ygritte  shes uh feisty winkpng classbbcemoticon alt  she reminds me of girls from scotland where im from so thats probably why i again loved tywinarya even if they need to get moving a bit with that storylineqarth worked out well i just dunno what happened really it was wonderfully creepy though theon gets a again um what else yeah no i couldnt find much to complain about im sure a bunch of you will though hahai agree with thisi gave the episode a 9 it made an hour seem like 10 minutes i know that the show is deviating from the books in some cases pretty significantly but the show holds up i think having grrm involved makes the differences still feel believable i think that i like show cersei better than book cersei and i like book cersei and i know that i like show qarth better than book qarth danys story is much more interesting in the show that it was in acok ygritte is pitch perfectthe show keeps me wanting more i look forward to each episode"
"packersfan",2012-05-14,"entertainment wise 910 faithfulness to the book drops it to a 610 this episode introduced a flurry of huge plot diversions from the book the only plot the seemed to actually follow the book was theon killing bran and rickon otherwise jamie kills this alton character why and accelerates the story of karstark forward in the book jaime and the lannister men killed some karstark men in battle these men were captured and at some point karstark killed them in prison and then robb had to kill him for killing pows i believe this all happened after lady stark unilaterally sent cleos frey now dead in the show jaime and brienne to kings landing to trade for sansa and arya just clumsy writing i was really hoping they would finally let ygritte go and jon join back up with halfhand like in the books now that he is captured i feel like they are going to make jon look more like a traitor than in the book where halfhand ordered him to join the wildlings and ultimately kill him in combat now i feel like they are going to have jon fall for ygritte first and then run into halfhand and have to kill him again just souring the story i dont remember the thirteen getting offd in the book all i remember from the undying is that somehow they got the dragons dany went to them and they almost killed her when one of the dragons burned down their dwelling another completely strange and unexplainable story written by hbo for no reason what is with the tyrion and cersei sob session about joff completely making cersei look like a poor victim when she really is a bitchwhat happened to that cersei too much time being spent making us feel for cersei and tywin lannister sheesh tywin taking a liking to this obviously highborn girl feeding her roose bolton didnt even do that in the book and he was from the north thus a good guy at first in aryas eyes i didnt read the book before season 1 so i dont know how much was changed but i feel that not so much was changed as to endanger future plots meaning when i read clash of kings and basing past events on what i saw in the season 1 nothing clashed but this season lots of major plot and character changes o well"

"FireNBloood",2012-05-15,"that has got to be one of my favorite episodes so far from the tv series it is extremely hard for them to weave so many different aspects of the book into the show i mean think about it you have a thousand different themes ranging from socioeconomic issues to politics to simple weather patterns affecting crop growth it is impossible to convey everything in the show and i personally thought this season would fall under the weight of it all instead they are taking some brave strides switching up storytelling so they an streamline certain events so it can be less confusing the only things that are really annoying for me are two things first cersei is way to sane she should be losing it at this point and should be more worried about the consequences of being sacked she and tyrion never connected like that remember the crib story from casterly rockthat shit was messed up they need to start setting her character up better also the scenes with rob and that girl are just stupid he is a freaking king she shouldnt be making it within 50 feet of that tent without guards pinning her to the ground and she basically tells roose bolton to get the hell out of the way or at least as a lord he would have taken it that way i bet he was thinking of all the nice ways he could skin them that sick bastard i understand things are gritty up north and not as dainty as those southerners but show some respect jeyne impostor he is a king and you are a foreigner"

"summer_stark",2012-05-15,"i liked this episode a lot actually but there were some things that bothered me some less important than others the first and foremost was the handling of the search for bran et al and the showing of the burned kids  not one person i know who hasnt read the books thinks its bran and rickon  and if you look on twitter 85 ok thats a guess of the nonbook readers there dont either it was just so damn obvious  and why in the books i was shocked and as another poster did i had to skip ahead to find another bran chapter to be able to keep going there were small inklings  the thought theon has that people are so stupid while looking at the  but it was very subtle i dont see why they couldnt have made it as subtle here  did bran and rickon have to stop by the farm and talk about the orphans couldnt they have just been shown own the roadthen cut to theon at the farm and the walnuts hell if they wanted some conversation re not being able to go to a neighbors they couldve had them talk on the road about how they cant stop anywhere bc theons hounds will track them and am i the only one disappointed by the fact that they dont hide in the crypts my only thought was that maybe they turned back around and went to the crypts  and the timing is just shown differently but that makes no sense since theyd meet each other on the road my only other thought is that this is how they find the reeds  who will harbor them and because the live in the marshes or whatever its called no one can track them there either way i thought that big reveal was super obvious and was disappointed to find out that most nonbook readers did too such a waste of a great chance for one of the better book cliff hangers shakes head otherwise i did like it  i even liked the pyat pree multiplies himself and takes out everyone forcing dany to go to the hotu makes logical sense in the storyline that shell go there and burn the place down and the warlocks will be hating on her after she leaves the jaime scenes were great but i thought the kinslaying while shocking and awesome in that way  though it was obv he was a dead man as he inched closer to jaime  was a bit absurd if they had to go to the extreme of physicality instead of conspiracy to pretend hes dead he couldve said im going to have to bloody you up a bit to make this real  make sure you scream etc hes impulsive sure and thinks cleos is an idiot in the books but i dunno as much as im not a jaime fan in the books anyway regardless of his redemption same goes for theon i couldnt bring myself to feel sorry for him except to the extent that no sentient being should be treated that way  but the whole scene was contrived and as much as im liking ygritte i think those scenes are also illogical where the fuck is ghost its not like they show how ghost cant come with him bc he is climbing the skirling pass or whatever  theyre just wandering the tundra ghost just takes off for days or weeks but isnt physically unable to come to jon seriously hunting for a few days is one thing but just not following jon at all for no reason other than direwolves are wild no theyre not  not where the starks are concerned dammit i like that they cgid the dw but at the same time it has made them even less a part of the story than last year  when at least they attempted to have the dw attack and defend  here theyre just eye candy bummer that said i am enjoying the show quite a bit and do like being surprised and after each episode im pretty happy so i gave it an 8 edited by summerstark 15 may 2012  0620 pm"

"packersfan",2012-05-15,"i gave it a 6 the lowest this season i generally felt that the episode was slow and probably a set up for the last three episodes ironically the story that worked the least was the branrickontheon chase while it was the most faithful to the books i think they gave too much foreshadowing information about the orphans and the walnut clue wasnt really obvious on top of that the bodies looked really fake all of which point to the fact that the bodies werent bran and rickon ive read several posters whose nonreading friends didnt buy it at all and my nonreading gf reacted the same i dont know how they could have make it seem more believable though the series shows so many brutal deaths explicitly and any offscreen death immediately raises suspicioni like what they did to quarth now dany has some real stakes at play and her burning hotu makes sense pyat pree and xxd are true threats to herim sort of neutral towards jaimes scenes i guess his long absence has made me forget about him a little the fact that he tried and failed to escape was in the books but i think its wise of dd to have it have immediate repurcussions cat freeing him the story is a lot tighter this way sidenote i wonder if well see the boat chase this season that felt very cinematic when i read itjons story was meh but i didnt care much for it in the books either the focus is so much on the wildlingsygritte youd almost forget about the others and wights its a shame because they were the very first thing introduced in the books and in the showrobbs love affair is really slow people see this relationship coming from miles away they need to move beyond the flirtatious pleasantries and get into some physical stuff not sex per se either that or show some sort of twist like she is actually a spy or somethinganyway did not like the episode that much it has nothing to do with changes but with pacingrant outyeah the robb romance is just completely messed up granted i understand that either way he will make a stupid mistake for a king who is pledged to another to keep a strong alliance but in the books it was so much more sudden and impulsive he stormed the crag then found out his brothers were killed and winterfell lost then jeyne westerling daughter of a lannister bannermanadding more depth and complication to the story comforts him eventually leading to them having sex then robb does what he believes is honorable and marries her completely disregarding other consequences such as pissing off his bannermen we are getting a little of that from the show mostly due to jaimes escape and killing of karstarks soni dont know why karstark really cares that robb is with this foreign bitchwould make more sense if a frey had said that anyways these writers just mucking up the story love the show for the action the intrigue the incredible costuming design etc but feel they are really doing too much when they have this excellent material that maybe needs tiny tweaks to fit on screenbut not these big sweeping changes"

"Karazax",2012-05-14,"as a new member to the forums and nonreader i am finding some of the story lines confusing this season i dont really understand what is going on with jon snow the ranger said they had to kill the wildling girl and jon volunteered to do it but then he couldnt so she temporarily got away but i dont understand why he tied her up again and where he is going with her when the other ranger said they didnt have the manpower or food to keep a prisoner wont the other nights watch just kill her if he finds them anyway so i didnt really understand what his plan was there i guess the wildling was trying to seduce him watching them walk thru the snow while she is trying to get him out of his pants was a bit boring didnt the girl say that they would kill any nights watch they caught and yeilding would just lead to torture before yeilding when the ranger asked her what would happen if he yielded but the previews for next week look like they took him prisoner so maybe that will happen next or maybe jon will join them to escape death or the other rangers rescue him i guess in this show he could die too but seems like a lot of rather boring story this season up north if that was to be his fate but then again look at what happened to bran and his brother we got to see magic reaching new levels of influence in the world i dont mind magic in the story but i do wonder why stannis doesnt just send an army of smoke creatures to kill all his enemies or why the bald guy who can make dozens of copies of himself doesnt just rule with that amount of power or why they let jorah and danys other people live after the coup i dont exactly understand why they need dany to keep the dragons alve either for that matter but she has been anoying this season anyway so if she dies it might make the story better i love tyrion though his story line has been good and it looks like he is starting to bond with his sister some as they both recognize what joffrey is besides the whole double incest thing cersei isnt that bad a person argueably catelyn is worse since she started the whole war by kidnapping tyrion with no proof beyond littlefingers word and we know what that is worth now it looks like sansa may get set up for marriage now that she is old enough and shae certainly took a big risk for her by threatening the other maid i wonder why she is so loyal to sansa she doesnt seem to be that caring towards tyrion perhaps she is a stark spy or something sansa used to dream about joffrey and now he is her nightmare too bad for her that joffrey isnt more like cersei but instead has jamies disregard for human life arya and tywin had some more great scenes this week the actors really do a great job and the visuals for the castle were pretty awesome it looks like tywin knows that arya is a noble but he hasnt asked her for a name yet still calls her girl i wonder if he knows exactly who she is on the one hand there cant be that many potential noble girls out there on the run who are that age and basic physical description of arya stark and it seems that someone would have mentioned that she was missing to him by now on the other hand you would think he would have her as a guarded prisoner if he knew she was a stark and not have her attending his strategy councils or bringing him his food and drink i didnt really understand why tywin had 20 of his own men hung rather than tortured or something if he was trying to find out who the assasin is i cant wait to see who her 3rd kill is going to be there were a few times when she appeared to be eyeing tywin up it looks like robb has a little crush on the nurse despite his vow to wed back in season 1 we shall see what happens when they go to the crag to accept its surrender im kind of surprised that a castle would surrender without a siege though so perhaps it is a trap or is the crag a village im not sure i trust the nurse at this point you can certainly see where joffrey got his evil characteristics from when we see the scene with jamie killing his own cousin just on the off chance that the guard might slip into a position that would allow him to kill him and escape an escape that was short lived and catelyn has to step in to save jamie from an early death in retaliation for his killing though the guard almost deserved his fate for his incompetance in going into the cell alone after jamie had just killed his own cousin and turning his back on jamie i didnt really understand what catelyn was trying to get out of him when she went with the big warrior women to see him but perhaps she finally got sick of his tongue and took vengeance for ned with the sword she took we can only hope then the other dirt bag theon chased down bran and his brother and appears to have burned them i dont blame them trying to escape but i dont exactly understand why they didnt take horses bran had his own special saddle from earlier episodes and it seems that would have been much faster i guess that is why they got caught but we dont know what happened to hodor or osha yet the bran storyline was kind of boring to this point so i dont care that much about them being gone though theon is still a bastard for turning on the starks that way we got to see the wolves some more but it did make me think about where were the wolves when theon took the castle it seems like they are even bigger this season and i would have thought the 2 of them would have protected them i wonder if theon killed them too anyway interesting episode even if some of it didnt make sense to me in its execution not one of my favorites but still better than most shows on the tv these days"

"Fakko",2012-05-14,"i too am somewhat confused about the goings on at qarth i thought pyat pree sp was engaged in simple tricks not real magic pyat and xaro clearly have conspired to rule but to what end is unclear maybe they believe in danys mission but then why didnt xaro just buy her the ships she needs cerseis conversations with sansa and tyrion humanized her somewhat they also revealed that she is not a clueless power hungry bitch but someone trying to make the best out of her very difficult complicated and unhappy situation she was almost motherly to sansa again theon displays how beyond his depth he is not sure what to do and making a series of poor choices that dont gain him favors with anyone on any side hes cooked tywin reveals he knows more about arya than previously thought he likes her and treats her well almost fatherly but pushes her back in line when she takes too much liberty still what does he know and what does he suspect robb continues to broadcast his impotence to everyone north of the wall its a good thing they made him a steward or hed probably be dead already his first ranger outing is a disaster man up robb jamie is a riddle he comes off as very personable and engaging but will slaughter anyone that provides him with an opportunity these are the traits of a true sociopath but is that what he really is he seems to genuinely care for tyrion and cersei sociopaths only care about themselves everyone else is a tool or a hindrance a good episode things are still gaining steam i am very much looking forward to the next episode"

"chico",2012-05-15,"so this is my first post i have not read the books and have told my friends that have to keep their spoilers far away smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  so anything i put in here is pure speculation based on my own inferences from watching the show so far smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  my thoughts on ep 7 where the hell is stannis ive been under the impression that renlys army was not too far from kings landing so now that stannis has that army to add to his own plus the ships he procured through his deal with the pirates well whats taking so long i know its probably just an issue of the climax to the season and when to start showing us that battle but im getting a little impatient robb robb robb come on man yes the nurse is hot and all but you cant just let your guard down like that your bannermen are watching and im getting the sense they are growing a little discontented with your decisions i hope this isnt a foreshadow of him suffering the same fate as every other honorable character thus far theon didnt kill the stark boys he might be conflicted but those are his little brothers  at least emotionally i think the giveaway was that he couldnt look at the crowd when the bodies were unveiled  hes been so proud  sure of himself and his decisions thus far why would he look away now my thinking is that its the orphan boys that bran  luwin sent to the farm earlier this season when bran was listening to all the requests my theory on the boys  bran probably told osha to take them to the wall as far as he knows jon snow who he considers a brother and his uncle benjen are at the wall so thats the safest place for them to go we havent been given any indication that anyone south of the wall knows that the nights watch has headed north oh dany her pride ego and ambition are totally betraying her i had thought much more highly of her before now it seems obvious that her only play at this point is to marry xaro she has nothing to negotiate with anymore i suspect that xaros higher ambitions are to eventually take over the whole island not just qarth and with dany he can also take over westeros that would be quite a kingdom to rule over and hes made sure to let us know that he came from nothing and is a completely mademan im still smarting over those undead guys being way more magical than we previously thought  parlor tricks my a im loving the exchanges between tywin  arya i could watch them banter all day smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  i still dont think tywin knows who she is but hes teasing little bits of info out of her every time they talk  he at least knows shes nobility of some type now sooner or later her secret will be revealed though  if he finds out soon enough hell at least throw her in the brig i think shell escape though  probably with jaqen i dont think shed use her 3rd name on tywin  he hasnt really done anything to her and really he did save her  and if she hasnt used her 3rd name then she can probably convince jaqen to help her escape catelyn she cant kill jamie  she needs him as much now as she ever did if she wants her daughters back and i seriously doubt that him ragging on neds infidelity will do any more to her than it ever has in the past plus even though she wont admit it she doesnt completely hate jon snow  he always acted like a big brother to her own children so she cant just ignore that i think shes going to cut off either a hand or a foot  maybe take his sword hand or take a foot so he cant try to escape so easily again that might also convince the bannermen to leave jamie alone for a bit im not sure i understand whats going on with sansashae or sansacersei first why would shae risk herself by making a threat that other maiden was going to tell cersei regardless so why risk being put in a cell or killed tyrion told her to lie low its just another moment where i wonder if shes really royalty from another island and we just dont know it yet  she might think she can buy her way out of anything unless i missed it  has she said anything since we met her in tyrions tent and she wouldnt play his game of truth or dare i also dont understand sansas reaction to bleeding was she under the impression that joffrey wouldnt want her if shed ever bled before surely these people recognize puberty any why does cersei continue to let sansa think shell marry joffrey there is no way thats going to happen i know theres a lot of characters to deal with this season but i feel a little like some absences are too long wheres varys why has littlefinger been so scarce what ever happened to roz have margery  loras made it home yet why do we continue to not see joffrey in some episodes he is the current king after all"

"Jennelyn",2012-05-19,"chicohbo has a viewers guide and the map looks to be pretty good you shouldnt have anything spoiled for you by looking at it and youll gain a lot of insight into the world httpviewersguidehronesseason2dany has always been one of my favorite characters because of the way she went from being such a scared abused young girl to a strong ambitious young woman and leader of people i think currently in the show she is asserting herself and trying to make things happen rather than being patient because she has her dragons she is a little too confident that she can get what she wants but her dragons need to grow up and she will need an army she is showing her young age by failing to comprehend what it will really take to conquer the 7 kingdoms she also has no idea how to rule once shes conquered so id chalk it up to ignorance unlike her brother she cares for people saving slaves from being raped last season and looking out for her dothraki followers and she isnt cruel or abusive if you cross her shell let you have it but she wont prey upon the weakas for catelyn she does do a good job of keeping her composure and remaining pragmatic i would say that she does have good reasons for doing the things she does and if she has a weakness its her children itll be interesting to see how that scene plays out because jaime does seem to be getting to her she really cant stand that man for what he did to bran and he has a mouth on himlittlefinger has been busy doing the bidding of the king and the hand of the king varys is around even if they havent shown him lately this happens in the books too you dont hear from characters for a while sometimes but then they pop up and you see theyve been quite busy id say with the show its either because of time limitations or the fact they dont want you to see what a theyre up to that they leave a character out episodes also it could get boring just watching them travel from point a to point b if thats all they are doing i have to give the show credit for finding ways to keep many of the characters on screen dany and robb really dont show up much in the part of the books this season is based on they know they cant just leave them out so they are inventing scenes for them and so far its working pretty well and its nice to keep the book readers guessing as well i think im a little biased when it comes to roz since shes not a character from the books i didnt mind her at all last season but this season i was a little annoyed with how much screen time she was getting i dont get how she just shows up at kings landing and all of the sudden she seems to be running littlefingers brothel"

"dark  sister",2012-05-13,"even though i am really happy that got was made into a series i think that benioffweiss have unfortunately bit off more than they could chew heres why in season 1 there were less characters and although there was still a lot of background that made the story complicated and perhaps a bit difficult to understand for nonreaders it worked background info such as cotf first men andals targaryen history the many gods in the series are what i am referring to what helped make season 1 more cohesive was the fact that ned stark was the center of the storm so to speak he was the loveable patriarch of a noble family and most of the events derived from him  roberts offering him the position of hand which meant that his queen and jaime were in winterfell etc etc neds being there set off a bunch of chain reactions and once he agreed to be roberts hand all the plotting started the only characters who were not really surrounding ned stark in the plot were viserys and dany they were also separated geographically however the writers did a good job of explaining why they were in exile and what they were trying to accomplish once ned was executed all hell broke loose and i mean that in a couple of ways firstly people who hadnt read the books were shocked and pissed that the main character of the series had been killed secondly it accelerated the war of the 5 kings thirdly and most importantly i observed a splintering effect of the storyline  now instead of a plot that is very texturedincludes subplots but is basically still about ned and his family as well as dany it became a hundred different storylines one thing that struck me forcefully was how much each episode of season 2 skips around in the first season each episode seemed like it spent much more time on each character and the cut from one scene to another was seamless and wellsegued this season it runs sort of like this two minutes with theon hunting the boys  cut  one minute with branrickonoshahodor going towards a village  cut  dany trying to find her dragons for two minutes  cut  sansa talking with the hound for 1 minute  cut  arya and tywin lannister talking for 3 minutes incredibly uncharacteristically btw  he even smiles a couple of times  cut  sansa gets her period and talks with cersei for two minutes  cut  jaime maunders on with a character  alton  who wasnt in the books for four minutes strangles him and a karstark son escapes  cut  tyrion and cersei have a hearttoheart even though tyrion has already delivered the infamous line of your joy will turn to ashes in your mouthum what  cut  etc etc etc i didnt want to generalize before i had seen more than half of series 2 but this fragmented style of filming book 2 is disorienting and annoying i understand that this might seem natural because there are 5 kings in the land so naturally everyone will be all over the place but what happens when even more characters are added as the series progresses will we only see half a minute of each character unable to savor the longer interactions we enjoyed in season 1 it appears that although the adaptation of the books to tv is wellintentioned there might be an inevitable downward spiral of fragmentation because of the growing cast the growing complexity of the plot and the unnecessary scenes they add to the show perfect example why on earth did they steal danys dragons if they hadnt made that decision there would have been extra time to use for longer scenes with the characters aside from that my opinion of episode 7 is much like it has been for all the other episodes thus far  i am left dissatisfied unfortunately the only high point for me was john  ygrittes interactions i love the actress playing her  shes got her character spoton and even though in the book i always hated it when she said you know nothing jon snow i thought the way she delivered that line was absolutely fantastic grim and not playful as i had always imagined edited by dark sister 15 may 2012  1021 am"
"Laohu",2012-05-13,"what did dagmer show theon before they ordered maester luwin to be sent back to winterfell it looked like walnut shells  ones that rickon would throw to the side after snacking oh yea eery music at the conclusion which set the mood perfectly more deviations from the book obviously but i am not going to complain about any of them terrific episode"
"Bride of Winter",2012-05-13,"i admit i was really hesitant at first but im so glad everythings coming into place with robb and catelyns storyline and downfall jeyne is obviously going to reveal herself as jeyne soon hbos so cuthappy they wouldnt include the crag unless it had a major purpose we have a very angry karstark a buildup with jaime and bran and rickon deadim going to sound really nitpicky here  but robb and jeyne must sleep together in the next episode im fine with them taking time to build their relationship in the first place but bran and rickons deaths has to be the catalyst its what set everything into motion some preexisting feelings is fine but their marriage has to be on a whim right after they have sex which was also on a whim im just kind of worried because it wasnt in the preview for the next episode but they showed them kissing in the general s2 previews dunnogif classbbcemoticon altdunno same goes with cat and jaime im actually not fond of them making cat contemplate freeing jaime before her kids are killed but whatever im convinced theyre gonna get this one right though edited by bride of winter 13 may 2012  0932 pm"
"axels15",2012-05-13,"they are taking a lot of liberties but i still think the episode works overall honestly the only change that worries me is why jon will kill the halfhand they cant change something so fundamental to his character right other changes the timing and therefore reason of cat freeing jaime in the books she learns that two of her sons bran and rickon are dead and in a fit of motherly rage she frees jaime in order to broker a deal with the imp to free her daughters in the show she does it before learning of bran and rickon and does so because she knows jaime will be killed which would spell the deaths her daughters without a doubt so i dont have a problem with it both choices were fueled by motherly tendencies and so the basis is intact it just makes her a little worse cause she doesnt have the excuse of grief jaime killing his cousin  dont really have any issue with it because it will make his redemption that much more important to viewers which im sure is what they were going for also hes been in like 2 episodes they needed to give him an extended scene so the audience didnt forget about him the dragon storyline continues to change again i have no issue with this her story in the book is imo kinda uninteresting until the house of the undying and by then its almost whats the point now there is a point the whole thing with xaro betraying her to be king thats weird but it certainly fits in with the character theyve made him into so consistency and as i mentioned jon snow captured by wildlings somewhat early and without the halfhand it looked in the scenes from next week like he might attempt an escape which would then allow him to get back to the halfhand and then would lead everything up as it should be if he stays with the wildlings though then it becomes another issue itll be interesting to see where they go with it but i do hope they dont drastically change his character things i liked the aryatywin scene was spectacular as always it does require some suspension of disbelief that tywin would simply strike up conversations with his serving girl but once you get past that its a wonderful scene with not a little bit of snark i will be disappointed when the opportunity for them to be together ends theons scenes  hes really a great actor though i imagine everyone who havent read the books are really going to be calling for his blood after this episode one thing i will say is that it could have been slightly more obvious who the hanging bodies were supposed to be â<U+0080><U+0094> both my father and my friend who havent read the books asked me who the hanging charred bodies were because he never really says their names i had to deadpan and say bran and rickon without giving up any spoilers that was really difficult im not the best at poker jaimecat scene  while for one reason or another jaimes first scene didnt do it for me probably because hes one of my favorite characters and i prefer redeemed jaime his scene with cat was perfect the quips about brienne were especially funny and i cant wait for them to get more screen time together sansashae  im well aware how much of a hated character shae is by many of the book readers but i thought this scene was pretty damn good sansas horror at having her first flowering was a stronger reason than in the books coming from a male so please dont kill me if im a bit off and shae is become more of a real character in my mind which will make her betrayal in the end so much more important although also slightly strange because why protect sansa but betray tyron this will have to be adressed ygritte  favorite part of the show right now shes just really outstanding and while i am worried about whats going on with jons story i cant say that i dont enjoy the extra time she is getting to spend with him imo shes rivaling peter dinklage in humor who strangely didnt get a lot of screen time today honestly nothing stood out to me as something i didnt like except maybe danys scene with mormont i know shes in grieving but honestly to me she sounds like a spoiled brat this probably has to do with me not really liking her character in general id love to hear other opinions on this because maybe im not being fair to her i have a few worries of where the show will end up but theyre minor im loving the show and i cant wait to see where it goes from here edited by axels15 13 may 2012  0932 pm"

"DragonAge93",2012-05-13,"why are we worrying about jons arc in the summary for episode 10 it says he has to prove himself to quorin in the ep 8 preview you can see jon rolling down a hill which makes me think hell get away from the wildlings and meet back up with quorin rattleshirt will chase him down and before he catches up to jon and quorin in episode 10 quorin will tell him what has to be done and itll probably play out as it did in the books edit after watching the ep 8 preview again it seems like quorin is captured as well as the wildlings push jon down in front of a captured quorin should be interesting to see where it goes edited by dragonage93 13 may 2012  1048 pm"
"TheTrueMithrandir",2012-05-13,"best episode yet the only thing that threw me off at first was when they showed bran and rickon on the move im hoping they hook back around and they end it with brans famous line winterfell is not dead just broken like me tywinarya exchange was great danyjorah exchange was great jonygritte even though they are getting a jumpstart on their relationship out of sequence was great see this is the kind of dialog that should have been present all along strong conversations and character development you know nothing jon snow yay she said it good to see them working in the rickard karstark angle as we all know what that leads to even though theyve changed quite a bit about around dany and quarth that ending was pretty good and it sure took me by surprise it also goes to show how completely alien and morally corrupt the customs and grabsforpower are in the east that look of surprise and terror on danys face was priceless 2 dead little boys awesome still would have been better had they worked in the reek angle but that is neither here nor there the final scene was still pretty effective and that final look on theons face as if to say maybe this wasnt such a good ideahaha and the best part of the episodefucking jamie i think this show has been in dire need of jamies wit and humor the character and his lines are written so well to begin with and the actor pulled it off with ease also did they mention genna lannister a bit different in the book but that was one of her sons there with jamie right good to see them going a bit deeper into the family lines her part in affc is also entertaining as well"
"MegasAV",2012-05-13,"very mixed bag episode for myself as well i loved the scenes with jamie and cat and i also enjoyed the casting for lord kastark as he showed how headstrong and dead set he was for vengeance but although i love the interactions between the actors tywin arya scenes are completely ridiculous this week in the context of the mysterious deaths that occured over the previous episodes he should be far more paranoid and distrusting of all around him rather than be coy with arya his cupbearer knowing shes of noble birth this new mountain character has no presence whatsoever much more enjoyed the passion brought to this character by previous mountain cersei basically admiitting that joffrey is a monster is also absurd she was beside herself after his death in a sos completely incosolable and refusing to even consider tywins innocence im not sure how joffs death will now play next season but i guess well see also jamie killing alton after sharing life experiences really i think makes it harder to see jamie as a redeemed character"

"Rockroi",2012-05-13,"so the message of this episode keep the stuff you have in cages or at the end of a leash under careful guard because dragons wildings and kingslayers make terrible prisonerswhat i likedthe man without honor you get this idea that every time jaime gets a twinkle in his eye some dummy gets killed jory a karstark a distant cousin aerys targaryen makes no matter jaime is not living by the rules imposed upon him by others and the starks least of all so when jaime operates its simple one way or the other he ainâ<U+0080><U+0099>t staying a prisoner i thought that â<U+0080> captured the essence of jaime so very well this was a man who wanted out of his chainsâ<U+0080> who wanted out of serving aerysâ<U+0080> who wanted to kill ned starkâ<U+0080> and for jaime well you better watch it jaime in so many ways is the darkness reaching out for the light and its either him or youand so he kills his cousin and a karstark and when faced with cat stark jaime is so very very jaime his honesty is not just understandable its refreshing he does not trick or fool anyone that ainâ<U+0080><U+0099>t his game jaime is simply living in this moment and in this moment he does not want to be a prisoner so he rolls the dice with cat and speaks the truth the whole time poor old dead nedâ<U+0080> he ainâ<U+0080><U+0099>t gonna let a silly thing like â<U+0080><U+009C>familyâ<U+0080><U+009D> get in his way nope and you ignore that at your perilthe crazy person without honor theonâ<U+0080><U+0099>s precarious problem has become manifest as the walls of reality close in on him he cannot stay he cannot go he is stuck and so he melts down and trashes out at anything around him his desperation is not focused like jaimeâ<U+0080><U+0099>s nor cavalier like ygritteâ<U+0080><U+0099>s nor innocent like the dragons its stark raving selfish and i though the episode nailed that i think theon is possibly the most underrated character in the books and he may be the most underrated in the showthe hostage and the queen i think that sansaâ<U+0080><U+0099>s dilemma in the jaws of the lionâ<U+0080><U+0099>s mouth is incredible and as forceful as in the books yeah itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a little strange to have the actress playing sansa screaming about her period when she now looks 18 but i can look past that i think that cerseiâ<U+0080><U+0099>s whispers to sansa are as good and as poisonous as they are honest its from a woman who has learned to distrust the world speaking to a woman who has not learned that she cannot trust everyonethe warlord and the silent girl okay look i get it to be read in the louis ck whiny voice tywin would do something if he knew his cup bearer was of high birthâ<U+0080> he wouldnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t just sit around and talk to herâ<U+0080> tywin is a big meany and would never be nice or goodâ<U+0080> i want tywin to be mean and bad so i can go on hating him end voice â<U+0080> this is why we canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t have nice things the tywinarya dynamic just works its fresh dynamic poised intelligent honest and real and the whole time these two fucking pros are playing each other and everyone else who walks into that room i watched this episode with a room full of people and when tywin was saying â<U+0080><U+009C>mâ<U+0080><U+0099>lordâ<U+0080><U+009D> to arya showing her that he knew i said â<U+0080><U+009C>if they just had these two people ina room and then had a various person from the series walk in and they schooled them for 55 minutes every one of you would watch that showâ<U+0080><U+009D> and everyone agreed itâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a great duo an amazing interplay and people like itso really why canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t we like good stuff done well why do we have to be so â<U+0080><U+009C>but tywin would be bald and heâ<U+0080><U+0099>s a jerkâ<U+0080> i love robbâ<U+0080><U+009D> well this works why canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t we have nice thingswhat i am on the fence aboutthe prisonertaker with or without honor i stated in a prior post for the last episode that i thought that the show was going to circumvent the jonquiron desertion for something else that may or may not be happening but they spent a lot of time on a story cross that is almost literally going nowhere okay he may be kidnapped etc but they gotta pull this thing together i like the quiron storyline as it was in the book and i am uncertain how that would take any longer than what we are seeing now i think that story always was a really solid idea and very interesting the one where jon is merely a prisoner gotta tell you its better than the â<U+0080><U+009C>catch and release ideas people were saying before but i am still not sold not sold at allthe king in the northâ<U+0080> i mean qarth wtf so we add in a convoluted powergrab in qarth really and how come anytime there is a counsel they are having their servants slash their throats really is this really what this season needed another awkward unrealistic highly convenient power grab in the middle of nowhere that somehow explains why they needed to kidnap the dragonshere is the one reason this is here and not in â<U+0080><U+009C>what i do not likeâ<U+0080><U+009D> at least dany is no longer trying to find the people who took her dragons they found her this marks the first time anyone has been able to get dany to go after anything that could conceivably fold her into the plot of the books if it sets her moving in the right direction so be itwhat i do not like and what we have to really start taking seriouslythe death of queen amidalain the horribly misguided star wars prequels once we get to episode 3 we are all left knowing that certain â<U+0080> cargo must be jettisoned droids have to have their memories wiped anakin needs to get into a suit and not trivially padme amidala has to give borth to two kids luke and leia and then die somehow and so as the episode unfolds we all know â<U+0080><U+009C>they gotta get finality here soonâ<U+0080> because this is the last episode before 4 etcâ<U+0080><U+009D> and so a droid tells us that queen amidala the mother of two newborns is dying because she has â<U+0080><U+009C>lost the will to liveâ<U+0080><U+009D> done and done in other words in order to meet this arbitrary deadline the story has to wipe her out so instead of putting together a real storyarc with conflict and tragedy etc nope she just â<U+0080><U+009C>lost the will to liveâ<U+0080><U+009D> and thatâ<U+0080><U+0099>s how its left teh suckso i get that if i ever write anything that says â<U+0080><U+009C>the show did x and i did not like xâ<U+0080><U+009D> i am in danger of being called a â<U+0080><U+009C>puristâ<U+0080><U+009D> which is somehow an insult look where we all are on the message boards of the series we all love and i can see that i also knew that when the show started it was going to be in 10 episode seasons that would need to be trimmed down to include the essentials and eliminate a lot of subtlety and details i get all thatthe series is drifting into this area where they are clearly trying to just finish in this allotted time period and they are throwing out common sense and story depth for the sake of â<U+0080><U+009C>coming in at the numberâ<U+0080><U+009D> most notably look at cat instead of having cat release jaime out of desperation after losing brand and rickon and to save her daughters she does it â<U+0080> well she does it because its episode7 and we have a season to wrap up so letsâ<U+0080><U+0099> cut out the middle and tie these ends together jaime is out in ep 7 not 10 done what jon snow not in it enough damn we have to cut some time soâ<U+0080> ahâ<U+0080> ahâ<U+0080> just forget all that stuff about quironâ<U+0080><U+0099>s plan etc just have him get captured and then turn over done and done what dany stuck in qarth for no reason well we gotta get her to the house of the undying so lets concoct this senseless power grab and sheâ<U+0080><U+0099>s therenuance and depth are being sacrificed in the name of 910 episodes and i get it better than no series at all i get that but the choices being made how come we needed so much time with dany â<U+0080><U+0093> for what purpose a convoluted mess in qarth how come so much time dedicated to jon snow chasing one chick he let go anyway oh great with the added bonus of a completely worthless scene where jon is uncomfortable that a hot chick wants to fuck him thank god we needed more of thatmeanwhile no stannis nothing meaningful with robb we finally got a jaime scene after 5 episodes without a word and for what so we can learn that dany is pissed somebody took her dragons or you could have shortened all this and just had her go to the house of the undying the reality is that no actoractress would agree to have danyâ<U+0080><U+0099>s part be so thin for season 2 so they added in a bunch of nonsense for her to do same thing with jon snow i get that but does it have to be this blatant and uninspiredand the nuance is being bled from the show all the subtlety and texture of the show is being bleached away in this mad dash to finish it all by 10pm sunday june3 i can appreciate a deadline but at the same time we have wiped out so much creativity so much establishment depth subtlety body and texture in order that queen amidala be dead by the end of the prequelsi just would like it of that while they are rushing so headlong into this that they stop and try to add more flavor and depth to this world instead of trying to see if they can get this ride to hit 100 before it spins out of controli want to make it clear the series is still really good and as a fan i love that it is being made acting is still great and they continue to add good stuff and stay true to key concepts in the books but at the same time i can see the wear and tear on show as it sacrifices much to get to 10 episodes and some decisions are not so

"Caro99",2012-05-13," even if he is now a kinslayer i loved jaime hereall of his lines were perfect and cat her acting was so good but if the northmen got crazy for what jaime did to karstark then imagine what theyll do when next episode starts i both feel for cat then and yet want to see briennejaime start theon yeah i am not symphatizing with his characater the way i did last week tonight i really didnt like him  dany well i didnt like her either that much tonight but pyat pree was great so spooky and i feel so sad for ser jorah sadpng classbbcemoticon alt   yrgitte is sooo funny i cant wait for s3 if tonight was just a taste of whats to come between her and jon but where is qhorin im not sure if i am liking this changes to the story  tywinarya they may not be in the books but i like this odd bond theyve created  and now to sansa and sandor that 1st scene with them was great love to see they are showing the nasty hound from the books and it was great to hear him say that he did plan to stay and protect her in kl until the blackwater that is theyve changed their story so much i am not sure what to hope for on that episode and about sansas moonblood sophie turner is such a talented young actress it is known  no sure what to think of it but i like shae now i guess that poor sansa will have yet another reason in s3 to be miserable about when she is married to tyrion her handmaiden going sour on her and though it was weird to see sandor in the room cant imagine who was more embarrased over the situation i like that he was the 1st man to see her after this important change cause maybe it will mean a foreshadowing for something in the following books the cerserisansa scene was as good as in the books and even if i liked the tyrioncersei scene gosh theyve really cahnged cersei"
"Pinn",2012-05-13,"i do like the tywinarya scenes although she is completely giving herself away and tywin knows it not sure how thats going to work outyes tywin totally suspects her hence the food sampling he is setting a trap and she is merrily falling into it by being too clever by half interesting to see how this plays out nice addition to the series"

"Fredwin",2012-05-14,"yeah this was the soapopera episode of the season lets hope for a strong finish though my only real issue is with the jon snow story arc firstly no orell no eagle its not like the audience needs to be introduced to skinchanging at this point but orell was a pretty huge part of this whole scouting mission hes what they were really up against and hes really what screwed them over in the long run an eagle following quorins group around would have made a point and opened up what was happening for an explanation next season second jon snow in the novel may not always make the best decisions but he makes the ones that need to be made so far in the series he has done nothing except what people tell him to do right now hes basically looking extremely stupid for losing a prisoner twice and causing the scouting mission to fail that is a huge deviation from the book third quorin is probably still going to sacrifice himself in the same way as the book but its not going to be the same quorin has already explained to the audience he is a deadman and its only going to look like jon got him executed"
"Robin Of House Hill",2012-05-14,"part of me wants to complain about all the deviations from the book then i realize that they have ten one hour shows to cover the whole book obviously they have to make changes and at the same time make it enjoyable the tywinarya interaction was fascinating aryas being led by tywin and possibly is too easily falling into his trap but it is entertaining and shows something of tywins personality we havent seen before the winterfell scenes eliminated some things and people but got you where you needed to be the tarred bodies were done perfectly ygrette was fantastic i had a great time watching her make jon snow uncomfortable my only concern is how will they work in the instructions halfhand gives jon in the book as for qarth that was a real departure from the book but it worked in enough elements from the book and was entertaining in the manner it did so would i have preferred it to be more faithful to the book yes but i dont think hbo is going to go for a season that runs 52 weeks much as id like them to"

"SnowBastard",2012-05-14,"not in a purist way i agree but the way the show is being handled it makes perfect sense reek is not in the hunt not at winterfell basically doesnt exist but just look at dagmers actions and reactions to theons choices he is mirroring ramsay from a financial pov it makes perfect sense to merge the characters from the ones we have already seen ralph is not a big name actor but overkill for book dagmer and miscast as book dagmer but he fits the provoking coniving side of ramsay so far dagmer has been pushing theon into all of his mistakes i could be wrong and ill be first to admit it but it just points to dagmer  ramsay look on the brighter side at least ramsay exists in the show"

"J_Crews",2012-05-14,"yeah people seem to have trouble understanding the difference between dagmer serving in the role of ramsey in this adaptation to dagmer being actually ramsey in disguiseagreed hes too old in my estimation to be rooses son the actor was 41 when filming most of these scenes theyve just consolidated the characters of dagmer and ramsey as he was when pretending to be reek most likely because they didnt want to yank budget funds from blackwater to pay another actors salary when by doing it this way they dont have to cast ramsey until next season at the earliest"

"J_Crews",2012-05-14,"consolidating reek into dagmer would take a lot out of the character if indeed there will be a different ramsay laterall it changes is him pretending to be reek to avoid being killed by ser rodrik which would be pretty difficult to explain seeing as how the series has never mentioned anything about him forcing lady hornwood to marry him then starving her to death to get her lands or his hunting of peasant girls nor of ser rodrik being sent to arrest him in the first place ramsay can still be the same soulless flayhappy monster as always with or without the initial reek deception very insignificant deviation"

"Ser Chuck",2012-05-14,"while i really liked this episode i had to warn my nonbook friends that its like 7580 nonbook if only because it was working on the new plots hbo installed here are my readers thoughts in no particular order they got theons plot back on track by the end even without ramsay and kept it vague while still making it clear to the observant viewer that its the millers sons who are dead we still need bran and rickon to double back to the crypt and the reeds to appear or else i fear their plot might be moving too fast the aryatywin stuff has always been a brilliant addition and remains thus even if it wastes time that should be devoted to the sacred texts as some would say talissa better be jeyne westerling or im going to get mildly annoyed although i did love lord boltons expressions as he walked away from her and robb im glad they were willing to include sansas flowering freak out and felt the addition of shae actually gave me my first ever reason to care about shae at all in either version the very idea that she could have actual sympathy for anyone is a real surprise as far as the gigantic departures im glad they have dany on track to enter the house of the undying as i figuredhoped the dragon theft would be an excuse to send her there but i still have no idea where in the seven hells they are going in an effort to make her story more exciting this season i will try not mourn the loss of the it is known cliche as long as we get to see her visions as far as jon snow i really enjoyed his interactions with ygritte but i am very concerned about his apparent capture by the wildlings why introduce the halfhand if jon doesnt join the wildlings on his command and how can we accept jon as a loyal man of the nights watch if he tries to return without that command i can only assume that in the effort to establish ygritte they decided to have his entire party be captured by the lord of bones at which point jon might initially refuse until he is thrown into captivity with qhorin who then orders him to join them regarding jaime i am now convinced that alton lannister was never cleos frey however if we are going to invent a random lannister for jaime to murder no matter how distant the relative is he not now an absolutely accursed kinslayer it took a few books for me to become a jaime fan despite all his crimes but i cant see him ever murdering a fellow lannister i also would have preferred for him to slay karstarks sons in battle rather than murder just one by treachery but i am happy to get that plot at all im sure plenty of viewers were confused enough by the karstark name suddenly appearing without explanation though i appreciated the sunburst on some cloaks i had hoped that with the known casting of a lord karstark we might have seen more of him before this there are so many random unimportant lannisters to kill off that i will never understand why we need fake ones at any rate if robb ends up beheading karstark just for wanting jaime dead im going to have a really hard time rooting for him in futility and that can only get worse if talissa isnt a westerling in conclusion as much as they departed from the books in this episode i really appreciated how much they drew from the source material in telling the tale of aegons conquest of harrenhall the marital life of robert and cersei and the tale of jaime squiring for barristan selmy in the fight with the kingswood outlaws forgot to add the best inclusion of a book scene brienne your sword i was always hoping that would be an end of episode cliffhanger and it nearly was also ygritte said you know nothing jon snow that alone deserves a celebration edited by ser chuck 14 may 2012  0401 am"

"LostSoul",2012-05-14,"i actually like the scene with tywin and arya it also shows ltywins cunning and suspicious the way he catches arya off guard with her knowledge in history of the targariyans  it shows he is willing to play any rules to catch his pray off guard i believe he has suspicions over the identity of arya was not overtly keen with theon ending scene as he shows the body of the two boyswhere are their dire wolfs surely that should have also been displayed to make it look more believable unless i missed it on screen"
"Bayard",2012-05-14,"after watching this episode and the preview for 18 i can safely say they destroyed the best part of acok for me the jon snow story alright there will be a fight with qhorin i knew there would be but thats not enough they completly took out warging ghost and the eagle the hunt of the nw men of course the discussion between jon and qhorin what is the point why would the wildlings want to keep jon alive in the books it was the direwolf that got their attention now what just because he is the son of a stark that would be a good reason to just kill him not keep him around maybe things will look better when all of this sink in but how could anyone believe that jon would defeat alone the greatest swordsman in the nw sadpng classbbcemoticon alt  oh i forgot so tywin suspected all along that arya is highborn nice introduction of the mlordmy lord thing but how in hell would he have let her still work in the kitchens that makes no sens i am sure this is the same for non book readers she would make a perfect hostage a little torturepressure whatever and she would confess who she was ok arya had an explanation a good one i thought but before that tywin had an oppinion and he didnt act on it what is going on with the script ps i guess no chain bummer edited by bayard 14 may 2012  0417 am"

"Catastrophe",2012-05-14,"in a lot of ways i almost felt like this episode was specifically designed to shock people who read the books there were at least three occasions where i sat back in total surprisei liked the qarth changes a lot danys time in qarth was rather boring in the books so im glad theyre actually having things happen there in the tv show xaro and pyat prees coup was believable and it establishes them as serious and credible threats for dany im really looking forward to seeing the house of the undying next episodei also like the dynamic between tywin and arya its absolutely brilliant character interaction i dont think its as outofcharacter for tywin as people think hes in private with a lowly serving girl it makes sense hed let his guard down a little bit i can definitely see how arya would remind him of cersei too i dont think these scenes make tywin look weak either hes always made it very clear to arya that hes her master hes a master who can be kind to his servants when they serve him well but hes still careful to make sure they dont get too comfortable around him in my opinion this is completely consistent with the way tywin was portrayed in the bookswhat happened with jaime on the other hand i have very mixed feelings about it on the one hand it was incredibly welldone i was suckered right along with alton into thinking that jaime was a decent guy trying to be friendly i felt like id been punched in the gut when the poor sap got murdered which is a lot more than i felt when cleos frey died in the books i can see why nikolaj costerwaldau said it was the best scene hed ever done and im inclined to agree with him in terms of writing acting and directing it was a superb scenemy problem with the scene is that it effectively makes it impossible for jaime to have a convincing redemption arc as he does in the books this version of jaime is a coldblooded sociopath hes about as close to irredeemable as you can get unless they completely change around his role later in the series i dont see how this characterization could possibly work in the long runalso they had jaime kill karstarks son during his escape rather than on the battlefield it makes sense for a tv show since itd be hard to build a plot around something that happened offcamera last season but it makes karstarks attitude seem a lot more sympathetic and reasonable i know jaime killed some riverrun guards in the books too but that was never why karstark hated him im also baffled by their choice to have catelyn free jaime before she finds out about bran and rickons deaths that was the one mitigating factor that made her decision understandable the way the shows portrayed things id be on karstarks side edited by catastrophe 14 may 2012  0435 am"
"Isy",2012-05-14,"fascinating episode lots of juicy backstory memorable scenes and interesting changes from the bookwinterfell nice to see rickon speaking and cute little scene of the foursome on the lamb the unhinged theon is a delight to watch  at this stage alfie allen has mastered the flipping between utter disgust at himself to taking pleasure from his sick actions i didnt get why theons 2nd in command called theon over to look at walnuts why would that mean anything otherwise all the winterfell scenes were done well i noticed one or two people asking didnt they go straight to the crypts but i thought they went into the woods then circled back maester luwins and theons reactions at the end were well played  but will watch this with my fiance later to judge whether nonbookreaders can guess it isnt bran and rickonkings landing sansa is an absolute triumph  the actress is playing her part so perfectly the horror at her blossoming was pitched well and go shae  i know she is an unpopular character but this one scene brought did her well i cannot believe weve not had a single shaetyrion scene since what episode 2 seems too longi really enjoyed the interactions between the hound and sansa tyrions chain is still not mentioned  hopefuly next week cersei and sansas scene was great wasnt so keen on the tyrion and cersei scene as i felt cersei was giving too much away and that felt out of character to let her guard down with him  but their dialouge was still fabquarth where is doreah from future scenes from the book she is going to need a handmaiden still just so hbo can have more gratutious scenes i havent read enough of the comments here yet to gauge whether the changes are seen as popular but i really like them dany has been played for a fool by xaro the killing of the 11 of the 13 was sinister and wellshot and the drama has been sufficiently heightened as with the books i am a big fan of quaithe  but i wish she was having mysterious scenes with dany as opposed to the more normalising scenes with jorahharrenhal the opening shot was fab  finally showing what you feel from the books harrenhal is a big desolate and depressing castle full of fear i am so glad we get these aryatywin scenes  i like that we see some vulnerability and we get an idea of his feelings on this war the good parts of this dialouge involved aryas contribution to the aegondragons tale also liked that tywin caught aryas poshness he is clearing sussing her out  and i loved that he drew parallels to her and cersei as that is how i have been justifying him putting up with arya and enjoying his time with her i am also glad he told her to watch her tounge please arya was considering how she could kill tywin and also that tywin has arya pretty sussed outthe north you know nothing jon snow  yes yes yes line delivered perfectly i saw a few people bemoaning ygritte grinding jon last week  but this was all part of the book that she fancied him and wanted to get in his pants and wind him up about his lack of sexual knowhow this episode continued that and also gave us some of the best dialouge and understanding of the wildings v crows story was gripping i wasnt so keen on the final scene where jon gets taken captive as i wanted the scenes from the book where he interacted much more with quorin halfhand  i pray this still comesriverlands in your later years youre more shewolf there is barely any fish left in you  what a line caitlin was perfect in this episode the actress does so well with her and the ruthlessness of jamie at this point is so well done that last scene involving jamie cat and brienne  although set in a different location to where we see it in books where i think jamie was also drunk  was so frickin good jamies side remarks about brienne his mocking over nedjon oooh cannot wait for moreall in all i thought the episode was my favourite so far this season we spent good time with each set of characters and were permitted good doses of dialoiuge that explained or questions motivations jonygritte catjamie sansacersei  but i do think we could do with certain threads being brought out again where is stannis and davos it has been too long since weve seen them  even a simple scene in the last episodes to show they are en route wouldve been good all seems too relaxed in kings landing cersei seems oblivious to the danger they face tywin is still in harrenhal and not fussed and tyrion is just pouring over a letter tyrion and shae need some interaction  i think of her as sansas maid now and barely remember she has anything to do with tyrion i will be miffed if quorin and jon dont have more time together  i always saw him as a strong influence on jon in the books it is time for twyin to leave harrenhal to put arya in a more dire situation as his servant she hasnt been giving us eyes on the horrendous situation in harrenhal beyond when she first arrived  she seems too comfortable there right now"

"Mercurial",2012-05-14,"this is just my opinion and its been a while since ive read book two but i found myself thinking two things throughout the episode the first was  wow was anything from the book actually in this episode in the first book the liberties were few and for the most part good decisions to further the story in the truncated form they had to but now im watching it and its almost like fan fic to me its so different its not the cutting of huge subplots why waste time introducing florian is you have no intention of using him but the active adding in new ones as well the second  and this is personal opinion of course  is it seems that the further and further away they get from the source material the more forced and even at times awkward it feels the way they changed the nature of jamies escape in my opinion changed fundamental aspects of the character ygrittes relentless flirtations with john came off as juvenile and forced to me for tyrion and cersi to go from vile threats to heartfelt onetoones seemed off all dany is at this point is begging and whining by turns the first season was so incredibly good but ive been uninspired by recent episodes perhaps because they raised the bar so high to begin i dont doubt that martin is being consulted a great deal and i expected and therefor have a great deal of patince for the liscence they need to be able to get where they want to get in the time allowed but moments like jamies conversation with his cousin great as it was seemed to be a huge chunk of time that could have been better used introducing tyrions chain referencing the wildfire that would be so crucial to the finale or otherwise advancing the story along the lines of the book itself ditto the interaction between arya and tywin which i also think is superbly done that is a lot of time spent in one episode which does almost nothing to further the story while so many other seemingly crucial aspects are being cut moreover it seems at times like they might have cut the episode down to maybe an hour and twenty minutes to successfully tell the story they wanted to tell but then had to slash another 15 minutes or so leaving certain scenes lurching like the walnuts thing  did they find walnuts on the trail before reaching the house with the orphans if so then why drop the pursuit if they found the walnuts since theyre clearly on the right track just my two cents the acting is still stellar the production values off the charts i just wish they would adhere a little more closely to the story the fans have spent years loving and years more anticipating being seen on the screen edited by mercurial 14 may 2012  0749 am"

"dtones520",2012-05-14,"i wish the people complaining about the changes would just realize that it is going to happen and watch the show for what it is which is a very well done adaptation of a great book series with a whole lot of storylines yes they have changed minor details and how certain plots play out they have to do it for a tvdramahbo audience but the major plot points are all still there name me an adaptation that 100 follows the source material and i will name you a liar"
"Arch-MaesterPhilip",2012-05-14,"i thought last nights episode was way too big a deviation from the books i hated the new mountain his appearence got seared into my mind after the way they introduced him last season and recasting the role ruins that for me i had the feeling that talisa was actually jeyne westerling last night just confirmed it for me i didnt like the way jaime shanked alton lannister in the cage because as others have said it makes his redemption more difficult i understand danys stuff had to get spiced up for tv but i wonder if what took place last night is going to affect how strong belwas and ser barristan the bold find their way to her and i am worried about how the house of the undying will be handled on a lighter note my mother who doesnt watch at all saw a couple of danys scenes and announced that she hates her character and im not going to hide the fact that i kind of like the softer tywin lannister"
"Evamitchelle",2012-05-14,"side note when i am teasing the purists i am having a bit of fun with you i am always amused by fans of source material complaining about changes in adaptations i dont understand why the people who hate the show continue to watch it but thats not for me to choose what they do as for complaining about the show no worries here ive had plenty for the 17 of these threads weve made so farone episode is about an hour long you can dislike one scenecharacter portrayal and still enjoy the rest its not like i love everything thats in the books either jon usually bores me to tears for example but ive still read the series twice without skipping his chaptersim not a fan of jaimes new escape plan mainly because i find it a completely stupid one did jaime really expect to make it out of the riverlands alone after months of malnutrition and inactivity  i doubt he would have killed a cousin for such a lousy shot at freedom im also amused that robb put one of his lords heir on guard duty like a common soldier but i guess you could say he wanted someone reliable to watch over the kingslayer apparently dd are increasing jaimes doucheness factor while decreasing cerseis that whole is it the price for our sins  strikes me as really off especially with tyrion as audience after all shes the one who said you win or you die there is no middle ground the worse change was altering cats motivation to free jaime though yes it makes sense within the show because karstark is still in camp and out for jaimes blood it was bad enough when they had tyrion and littlefingertell cat that releasing jaime was the only way to see her daughters again because she is completely stupid and could never have figured that out on her own but now shes just reacting to karstarks threats instead of taking the initiative and freeing jaime of her own accord whats even worse is that this is apparently dds idea of making her character more sympathetic read  making her a doormat considering how much im complaining youd think i found the episode worthless but thats not actually true i found everything else pretty great especially rose leslies acting and the winterfell scenes alfie allens face is killing me particularly at the beginning when that guard refers to hodor as the giant and at the end when he looks at the childrens burned corpses and donald sumpter is spectacular as well the corpses seem a bit too carbonized for luwin to be able to tell its no bran and rickon though which would mean he would only realize they were still alive in his final moments im already expecting a river of tears for me theons arc is the best on the show so far"

"Versiroth",2012-05-14,"first off people really need to get over the fact that some things are different in the show than in the books martin can be as deliberate and slow in the books as he wants to be he can have 4 chapters that reside completely within a characters head he can have things drag on as long as he wants etc they cant do that on screen it just wouldnt make for good television purist would say yep that was spot on while everyone else would say did anything actually happen in this episode i fell asleep 3 times as far as the episode goes winterfell the walnuts are there as a plot devise for the audience only dagmars idea was to pull a bait and switch which is actually what happens the walnuts are there simply to fool the audience into thinking the boys are the ones killed bran rickon osha and hodor will likely never return to winterfell you wont see the scene with master luwen either its just not important to the tv show that he knows the boys lived since hes about to die anyway all thats left is likely yara showing up to tell theon hes screwed and then ramsey sacking winterfell making it seem as though theon is killed im sure beyond the wall again jon doesnt do much in this book so somethings had to be created i do hate that the battle with the others seems to have been cut out but i guess they figure jons story is more important what will likely happen now john will likely find that qhorin had been capture as well and hell likely tell jon to kill him and join the wildlings to spy on mance so the end result would be the same but you got to see john do more than walk through the snow for 10 episodes in the riverlands ok jaime at this point is a bastard everyone knows this they arent going to show him being all noble and such right now because once he does start to change some they want it to be more pronounced him killing his cousin there and antagonizing catelyn is the writers way of showing you that hes still an arrogant douche personally i still hated him even in adwd kings landing see this is why sticking to the book can be a very poor choice for the series the moon blood scene was horrible it was pulled from the book yes but come on sansa is taller than cersei now and looks to be 17 or 18 at this point also i didnt like the scene with tyrion and cersei either because i hate cersei and the books never painted her into a good light as they tried to do with jaime she was always conniving always backstabbing etc which honestly may have been what they were trying to do there pull tyrion into a false sense of family so cersei could stab him in the back in the coming episodes harrenhall i think arya will ask jaqen to kill tywen but hell be leaving at the time when she realizes shes too late shell ask him to help her free some captured northmen that were just brought in then well likely get to see the weasel soup scenes edit fixed grammatical errors its too early haha edited by versiroth 14 may 2012  0816 am"

"Versiroth",2012-05-14,"here are some of the changes that iâve had issues with although we might disagree on their relative importancejaime killing his cousin turning him from a man whos two really bad deeds could be justified into a sociopath thus making redemption seem unlikelyrobb falling in love with talisa and flaunting it in front of all of his bannermen changing alot of things about the red weddingnow it seems that cat will release jaime without getting the news of bran and rickon changing alot of things about her decisionscersei complaining to tyrion about what a crazy nutbag joffrey really is so why all the drama when they offed him at the purple weddingi could list more but iâve already done so in the threads about the earlier episodesagain this is the same jaime that tried to kill a small boy for love do you think sacrificing some distant relative is some how worse than that i think this is a case where your mindset with jaime is of him after his redemption premissing his hand jaime was not a good person at allwe never saw how rob fell in love with talisajeyne in the books and the red wedding will happen just the same robb will likely come back from the krag married to jeyne and the freys will be outraged either that or theyll add in more plot of him being wounded at the krag tended to by talisa etc either way the end result will be the red wedding catelyn has 4 children that are currently being held captive she has something in her possession that she feels will free two of the 4 thats honestly reason enough especially since her bartering tool may not last the night and she knows that sansa and arya are as good as dead if jaime dies plenty of reasoning therecersei also tells sansa that she will love her children as she does her own knowing that joffrey is crazy and not loving your son are two different things entirely of course shed be upset when he dies edited by versiroth 14 may 2012  0920 am"

"mpbarnes",2012-05-14,"im still really hopeful about all the changes based off of what we didnt get this episodefor instance doreah is still not found we know she and drogon get along there were only two tails in the final scene last episode we now know doreah had a very good reason to not show herself while dany was still with xaro i think doreah and drogon show up in ep 8 and dany goes to the house of the undying with drogon ghost is still missing in action its quite possible that ghost will attack the wildings and jon will be able to get free having ghost show up in ep 8 gives jon a chance to reunite with qhorin before being taken again by the wildings robb hasnt returned from the crag its possible he wont return in ep 8 either its possible that theres a trap at the crag and hell get wounded and things will progress in a similar fashion as in the books except perhaps jeyne saves him because shes seen him not as an enemy but as a good man id like that change more than just robb has a weak moment if their union serves a greater purpose than just young love we havent seen ramsay and likely really wont see ramsay but the burned kids all but assures that theon is going to get his at the end of this season it seemed like they had changed so much by not including the reeds or ramsay but theyve trimmed the fat and given us a similar story that is more believable theon needed an ironborn devil on his shoulder someone to remind him of how hes supposed to be and give him dastardly advice dagmar does this perfectly while allowing dd to not fully introduce ramsay until season 3 after theyve trimmed a fair amount of minor characters people please think before you continue with the dagmar  ramsay delusions youre starting to sound like obama birthers dagmar is iron born hes been living with the iron born for years and years fighting with them thats why he has their respect and is able to help theon with them just think for a moment why would roose have his bastard on the other side of the country when hes supposed to be at the dreadfort as a kid growing up and now as an adult holding the fort while roose is away dagmar  roose makes absolutely no senseid believe quiathe is really lyanna stark before i believed dagmar  ramsay well get ramsay in season 3 hell be just as if not more fucked up than he was in the books because well likely get him torturing and flaying theon all season long on catjaime its possible this change works better than cat releasing jaime because shes heard about bran and rickon instead of cat betraying robb shes protecting his interests it makes the contrast between what she does and what karstark is likely to do kill a bunch of lannister prisoners much morewellstarker robb cant be a just king if he doesnt kill his mother for freeing a prisoner because of her kids but then puts a man to death because of what he does after his kids have been killed catelyn sending jaime off before she finds out about winterfells latest news actually works better show cat has been much shrewder than book cat if karstark kills jaime the stark girls definitely die cat is seen to be protecting robbs interests and her own when she could have easily just sought revenge karstark is shown to have committed treason by directly going against robbs orders and endangering robbs family still much to be seen i think most of these changes will work well my biggest gripe was that tyrion mentioned that stannis is 5 days away so we know that the time frame in ep 7  9 is only 5 days thats a very short amount of time for a lot to developbut well see how it goes down in the coming weeks"

"Isabella Stark",2012-05-14,"yes having catelyn freeing jaime because karstark is going to kill him makes sense it just strips her of any agency she ever had turning an active decision she made on her own into a passive reaction to someone elses plan i could have accepted it if it had been a one time thing but the trend since season 2 has been to take every idea cat ever had in the books and to give it to someone else usually a male character as such you have robb advising her to go to renly tyrion and lf convincing her to release jaime and brienne commandeering their escape from renlys tent and renlys camp all of those things should have come from cat instead she spends half her scenes crying i should be in winterfell with my babies i agree with you about the robb sending her to renly part but disagree about the jamie releasewith regard to the jamie release i think tvcat is being smarter than bookcati think releasing jamie in response to a specific offer to trade him for the girls is smarter and more rational than sending him to kings landing on the assumption hope that the lannisters will release her daughtersbookcats decision was an emotional decision after the boys apparent death and i thought it was stupid here tvcat is rationally assessing the situation in robbs camp and coming to the probably correct conclusion that jamie wont last the night and shell lose her bargaining chip just because its in response to karstarks raging doesnt take her agency away"

"jlk7e",2012-05-14,"1 catelyn should not release jamie before she finds out about bran and rickon the action of betraying robb which is what it is only makes sense under the prism of her finding out about bran and rickons deathin the context of what theyre showing it makes total sense for catelyn to free jaime if she doesnt release jaime hes going to be lynched by karstark and those sympathetic to him before the sun rises to have any chance of getting her daughters back freeing jaime is the only thing to do in this context i think it becomes less of a betrayal of robb  robb isnt there and doesnt see the situation robb wouldnt want jaime lynched any more than catelyn does sending him off to kings landing with brienne is making the best of a bad situation"

"Evamitchelle",2012-05-14,"i agree with you about the robb sending her to renly part but disagree about the jamie releasewith regard to the jamie release i think tvcat is being smarter than bookcatthe two situations are quite different from one another so im not sure its possible to compare how catelyn is being smarter in one rather than the other sure in the show it makes sense that shed free him now rather than after the news of her sons deaths reach her but thats not what happens in the books so theres a false equivalency there in both cases she tries to make the best out of a bad situation but in the book version she is taking the initiative while in the show version she is just responding to karstarks impending threat i think releasing jamie in response to a specific offer to trade him for the girls is smarter and more rational than sending him to kings landing on the assumption hope that the lannisters will release her daughtersbookcats decision was an emotional decision after the boys apparent death and i thought it was stupid here tvcat is rationally assessing the situation in robbs camp and coming to the probably correct conclusion that jamie wont last the night and shell lose her bargaining chip just because its in response to karstarks raging doesnt take her agency awayrobb later admitted himself that he should have traded the girls for jaime when he still had the chance even a sansajaime exchange would have been a great deal for the starks sansa is extremely relevant politically speaking as the lannisters and tyrells quickly realize and quickly take advantage of while jaime is completely useless he cant be killed because the lannisters have hostages of their own but he cant be exchanged either because hes too important and having him as a hostage does not in the least prevent tywin from carrying out his plots sansa gives the lannisters or tyrells or whomever a claim to winterfell aka 17th of the kingdom exchanging her would have been the smart thing to do since catelyn had no way of doing that earlier she took it in her own hands in the only way she could that doesnt make her actions stupid to me"
"Serr Parker",2012-05-14,"also i thought jamies capture was too soon after he escaped the capture scene was about 5 minutes after he escaped i would have preferred him to be caught trying to escape on the night and join the two scenes"
"Evamitchelle",2012-05-14," didnt she do at least two of these thingsshe tells robb that balon is not trustworthy but she makes no mention of theon being the envoy in the books she agrees to having robb send his offer to the iron islands but she specifically tells him that anyone would be better than theon as messenger robb is the one who has the idea to send someone to renlys camp while catelyn was the first one to think of it even before the blackfish and during the king in the north scene when she should have been pleading for peace she stays silent not long after she tells robb that we will kill them all"
"Tadco26",2012-05-14,"this i completely agree now that there will definately not be any mention of the chain or the chain itself for that matter i cannot believe that this piece is going to be omitted last night when tyrion said 5 days away i almost shit myself they have a lot to get ready in kings landing in 5 daysthis was an odd addition for the writers to make as far as i can recall this is the first mention of time involved with travel so even though we can joke about littlefinger teleporting from renlys camp to harrenhal we dont know for sure how much time has supposedly passed but barring them saying stannis has some how been delayed we know that the events from that point in the episode to the attack in episode 9  5 days which not only rules out the chain being started and completed but also gives us a time measuring stick for every event in every other story line which means that tywin has to march his army from harrenhal to kings landing within 5 days if he is going to participate in day 1 of the battle of blackwater it will also give us a time frame on any other travel raven delivery speeds and events for next episode and up until the attack in episode 9i dont really understand how anyone can say the chain was an unrealistic idea chains have been attempted in real life for similar effect such as the hudson river chain the harbor of constantinople edited by tadco26 14 may 2012  1140 am"

"Jaxom 1974",2012-05-14,"it is a difficult thing to divorce ones self from knowledge of material as rich as asoiaf when dealing with a television adaptation i have tried to approach each and every episode looking at it in two ways 1 how does the show do as a whole independent entity 2 how does my knowledge of the source effect how i think about the show i like to think that im smart enough versed enough in pop culture and the general sense of the way television adaptations work that i can do boththe reader in me rails at a lot of the general changes in that i think that things may have worked as well to keep certain threads from the story intact that may not have kept viewers who havent read the books awayhowever as a whole its a solid solid show grand big heavy but its still very well done i can see that i can and do enjoy it immensely especially since it can be kind of fun to try to out guess where the hell the show creators want to go with the material theyve taken and changed so heavilyso i try to couch my comments on the idea that the show is its own entity and how is it working though i freely acknowledge that the books and knowledge from there intrudes on some of itha i called jon snow getting blue balls last week and ygritte confirms tonguepng classbbcemoticon altp  it was a good scene between the two because while her teasing is fun it reestablished jons vows and shows the diiferences bewteen the watch and the free peoplethe deviation from the end of acok here is stark no pun intended while the actor playing ygritte is wonderful how folks have decided shes hot when shes that bundled up the scenes themselves arent working as well as they could for me theyre getting to the same point that the books did but to take away jons interactions with qhorin and the others as they race through the frost fangs seems to lessen the impact of contrast jon goes on the ranging with one set of ideas about the wildings in his mind from qhorin he not only learns there is more to it than that but it is also a strong reaffirmation of what it is to truly be a brother of the nights watch this makes the sacrafice of the others as they try to get back to the wall the sitting about the fire saying the oath again much more powerful and gives some proper context to jons orders from qhorin and his subsequent actions in asosthis is an instance where i dont know that the change works as well other changes the timing and therefore reason of cat freeing jaime in the books she learns that two of her sons bran and rickon are dead and in a fit of motherly rage she frees jaime in order to broker a deal with the imp to free her daughtersin the show she does it before learning of bran and rickon and does so because she knows jaime will be killed which would spell the deaths her daughters without a doubt so i dont have a problem with it both choices were fueled by motherly tendencies and so the basis is intact it just makes her a little worse cause she doesnt have the excuse of grieffrom a book standpoint moving the scene with jaime and cat here was a misstep not knowing about bran and rickon means that cat is freeing the kingslayer if thats what shes doing to save his life i acknowledge that it makes sense that she needs him alive to ensure the life of her daughters but thinking her sons are gone really amps the drama of the scene from a pure show stand point the escape attempt tracks though it seemed a little high handed to have jaime kill the relative it is as if they needed to remind the audience that hes still technically a bad guy i think it may have worked better if the attempt had been part of a tyrion plot as in the books but this still works having a karstark killed still works the alteration of having catelyn confront rickard karstark sort of workstheons scenes  hes really a great actor though i imagine everyone who havent read the books are really going to be calling for his blood after this episode one thing i will say is that it could have been slightly more obvious who the hanging bodies were supposed to be â<U+0080><U+0094> both my father and my friend who havent read the books asked me who the hanging charred bodies were because he never really says their names i had to deadpan and say bran and rickon without giving up any spoilers that was really difficult im not the best at pokerso much of theons acok scenes have been used in the winterfell arc i can see the grrm dialogue as the characters are saying the lines sure some aspects have been changed but its still the strong wording and context that is thereuntil we get to the chase in the woods i know were still getting ramsay snowbolton based on the earlier episode but changing the bit with the orphans to being essentially theons idea it just doesnt track with the character that has been portrayed theon on the show as in the books is so desparate to be accepted for who he believes he is hes always been easily manipulated by stronger personalities which is why his povs are sometimes hard to read and why his road to redemptionsrealization in adwd is as strong as it is here if using the unseen orphans was dagmars idea it didnt come through clearly and even if it had this dagmar is underutilized to make him seem inconsequential yes changing it to be theons idea is a drastic departure from the books but its also a drastic departure from the show as well as theon on the show has never actually shown any ability for thinking on his feet in such a manner nor has he shown any kind of evil streak petty and cruel in a kicking puppies kind of way but never evilyes there was some kind of something or other between roose and jeyne when he left i cant quite say what it wasa recognition of some kind not suredoes it matter theres been too little shown on the show to establish a proper chain of events that will lead to rooses defectionbetrayal that hes still with robb rather than at harrenhall really does lessen some of the impact just my opinion on that one thoughi remain neutral on the dany stuff until i see how they go about it i still predict a very tepid house of the undying as any images she gets will not be of the prophetic red wedding type or flashbacks to rhaegar as that would make no sense to anyone as theyve barely talked about him or the significance of the song of ice and fire as a whole with regard to the show its working for the most part though other than jorah and that one dothraki guard we see at the top of the stair in her first scene last night is there anyone left with herthe theon scenes kinda like in book 5 are owning"

"A Stark in Salem",2012-05-14,"i liked this one better than last weeks but i really wish i could like it more so loved the first season but this one is just too much for 10 episodes way to much the writers are leaving out threads in the books that really suck the flavor out of the story first the crypts were already mentioned maybe not major in itself but it combined an important set of details one of the coolest things imo of the whole escape sequence was having the two dire wolves go off and leave a bunch of confusing paths for theon and friends to run around chasing so now its like theon actually just gives up chasing them down even though they are on horses ok pretty lame though it makes him killing the millers kids looks even more cruel and pointless i admit and what is up with jon seriously where the f is ghost hes with him the entire time hes beyond the wall save for hunting for a few hours the only time hes separated a bit is because he has to climb up that huge cliff which didnt happen in the show anyway hes definitely with him by the time he meets rattleshirt maybe ghost will be another surprise appearance in the nick of time but it doesnt show much of the connection they have whcih by then in novel is only getting deeper actually the whole ygritte thing is kind of annoying in general she doesnt seem that tough speaks too well and jon looks like an idiot letting her escape twice and again the rest of the rangers surely would have tracked them down and met up way before a whole day had gone byi still dont really get the stolen dragons thing either though it seems likely the story line will be resolved pretty much the same way it did in the book i guessi dont mind the tywinarya thing that much though she seems to be getting less clever minute by minute now shes bragging the to leader of all she hates about her history knowledge and yet expects to be taken for a masons daughter ok i forget who got that speech about my lordmlord was it actually her or someone else and why do we never get to see her sword needle work training in secret as it mentions maybe 100 times in the books its key to her thirst for vengeance and hatred for whats happened to her and her family i still like seeing her thread but its not as interesting"

"Mercurial",2012-05-14,"true some changes are necessary some are fine and some even add good stuff to the story some changes are frivilous stupid and pointless and those are the ones i rail againstfor example i had no problem with them consolidating the scene where arya frees jaqen yoren is killed and arya  gendry are taken captive and sent to harrenhal in the book nothing of huge significance happens while arya gendry  co are on the run before taken by the mountains gang so why not get them on to harrenhal that much quickeri do however have a problem with ros the noncanon whore sucking up valuable screentime when we already have precious little of it to go aroundi have a problem with joffrey having whores beat each other just to show us how zomgevyl he is when we just saw him have sansa stripped and beaten in the middle of the hall hes a douche we get it whats infuriating about things like that to me is that jaimes canonescape attempt could have been a quick scene included in that episode instead of joffreys nonsense that way jaime wouldnt have been offscreen for 5 full episodesmy 02cant disagree with any of this i could add to it certainly but my overall issue is theremoval of things from the book that i loved and that i consider important to make room for the addition of things that at this point seem superfluous and out of step with the rest of the series that adheres more closely to the bookits not a matter of thinking jaimelittlefingercersei didnt say that its a matter of thinking that jaimielittlefingercersei wouldnt have said that"

"Knight of Ashes",2012-05-14,"im glad someone agrees ive taken most of the changes in stride you know as long as it leads to the same end its kept things fresh for those of us familiar with the story and while i dont always agree with the changes they still work but this one has me flustered jaimes my favorite character after all i cannot imagine him actually doing this yeah hes done some horrible stuff ill never deny that but this specifically felt entirely out of character for him he just isnt all scheming like that after reading book three and four i kind of started viewing book two in regards to jaime as kind of a cooling off period you hate him so much in the first book but then you barely see him in the second and in the one scene hes in he doesnt really do anything besides mock cat which is kind of funny and relate a story that makes his killing of aerys more understandable im not saying that this is what makes him likable but all the time away from him helps to cool the anger one feels towards him now its just been rekindled all over again i was already worried that his redemption might not get across so well on television as it did in the books now im more concerned than ever i immediately told my brother who was watching the show with me that jaime did not do that in the books my parents who have also read them were also annoyedyeah i havent minded a lot of the changes theyve made but its quite different if its ones favorite character they seem to be going in the opposite direction with jaime more villainous and cersei more sympathetic i shall adjust to it if i must cause i enjoy some of the reinterpretations though nonbook readers are missing out on ultracold tywin whispery roose etc but at least theyre spared batshit crazy cersei"

"Blangadanger",2012-05-14,"this episode had some thrilling scenes i laughed at ygrittes mocking of jon and its clear that he is already weak against her fiery personality i liked the way they did the walnut scene removing the maester before they take the orphans for decoys because it illustrated what happened in the book better though without reek ive always thought that cersei viewed joffrey as a means to an end ie power so when joffrey begins to take that from her in the show it totally fits that shes lost any hope for him they are starting to make sansa more sympathetic and sophie is serving her character well i really love aryas scenes with tywin but i think the suspension of disbelief is starting to crack i think they really need to be focusing more on aryas interactions with jaqen hghar instead i have almost zero interest in robbs affair with talisa if anything i think im losing sympathy for him and his ultimate doom yes shes gorgeous and probably much more so than any daughter of a frey but the brilliant strategist and general is seemingly oblivious of the danger in consorting with the enemy dont think i understand the criticism of jaimes latest murder so youre fine with him being redeemed for all the other brash things jaimes done but you cannot redeem this one because its a distant relative thats silly this is the kingslayer were talking about hell do anything to get back to cersei at this point if anything this particular murder only makes catelyns release of him even more shocking to viewers when it comes i think they still have plenty of time next season to start working on jaime understanding the wrongs of his past at this point it doesnt matter what they add to jaimes list of misdeeds because the list is too marked already"

"Leuf",2012-05-14,"lets get this one out of the way tywin orders the mountain to start burning and pillaging to find the bwb except he already ordered him to burn the riverlands in the last ep of season 1 what has he been doing and what does tywin think has been going on for the last 6 episodes aryatywin is starting to get stale for me it was really interesting but they are beating it to death dagmer isnt ramsay hes syrio forel it is known i went through this on wic but in regards to jaime killing alton instead of perhaps just injuring him or including him in an escape plan i think jaime would see him as just slowing him down in any escape so he cant take him with him he doesnt want to leave him behind either because hes still a lannister and has some value as a prisoner to the starks his intention is to either escape or die trying so as far as hes concerned hes never coming back to that cell so in jaime fashion he decides he just needs to kill alton and i dont think he spends more than 30 seconds figuring out this idea before hes committed to it then in a slightly more honorable fashion than with aerys he spends some time talking to him first so hes got some comfort then hes honest about what hes going to do to him then he kills him quickly before he really even has a chance to process it so hes following a sort of jaime morality about it i dont think its out of character for him i was okay with the idea of cat releasing jaime early before she gets word of bran and rickon if the show needed jaime released earlier than that would allow but if cat is going to release him in the same episode that she finds out about bran and rickon then what is the point of having her not find out first rose leslie is fantastic enough as ygritte that i am taking a wait and see approach on how jons story will work it out i dont see how qhorin can be captured when they made a point of specifically having ygritte tell us they wouldnt take qhorin prisoner so i dont see how this can work out well but we shall see three episodes in the row without ros if i didnt know grrm was writing blackwater i would be expecting they would make up for this oversight by having the entire battle narrated to us by ros as she looks out a window getting fucked from behind"
"Hoo",2012-05-14,"as far as tyrion chain how can it be a secret when every blacksmith and apprentice was told to start hammering links this is another disappointment when dragonstone and pyke were shown not a singlw longship appeared in on hbos screen yet in the book there are hundreds looming off the coast on both sides of westeros in light of this the chain in the book makes sense we get no action version of the book where soap opera bs talk and makeup are more important than the events pertinent to clash of kings"
"bardgal",2012-05-14,"ok  i posted this on the nitpick thread but after reading this thread i thought i should post it here too apologies for the repeat if youve read that thread smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  my friend who hasnt read the books turned to me at the end of the episode with a look of horror and said are they really dead to which i responded do you really want to know he hadnt even noticed the two kids at the farm so yeah  there are going to be plenty of people who think what theyre supposed to think at this point that theon really would kill the stark boys as for the buildup to blackwater  i think well get a ton of that next week i hope so anyway and some talk about the chain i might be the only person who is fine with all the changes so far remember the books are all written from different povs of certain characters inout of their head so a lot of action happens offstage and is only described in exposition by other people whereas we are getting to see some of those events in the show robb and lying lady talisa there is also the difficulty of playing a characters internal mentalemotional narrative that somehow needs to be put into live action instead of happening inside their head because you just cant shoot that thats why a lot of the things that are being changed are being changed the way they are im not bothered with the changes so far because i think theyre going to work themselves out in the long run ones that come to mind  twyin  arya next week ep 8 roose bolton could show up at harrenhall weve seen a preview of tywin rushing out to kings landing to help with the blackwater i dont have a problem with he and arya conversing because it reinforces just how smart arya is which is paramount shes already killed three people  jaqen helped with two and is about to kill another to escape harrenhall it gives tywin a lot more dimension than hes given in the books which will make what happens later a lot better of course he speaks to her  shes the only other person at harrenhall with a functioning brainstem i did love the my lord vs milord from tywin only to be cleverly schooled by wicked smart arya with the my mother taught me how to talk proper which is the lowborn way to say it followed immediately by properly oh snap im sorry who is smarter than tywin lannister yeah that would be arya stark  jon  ygritte i was worried until she got away from him last night theres no reason that they havent also caught qhorin while we were watching ygritte bait jon establishing their relationship now gives a lot more credence to what happens between them later otherwise it might not be very plausible when she comes to his defense when her life isnt at stake it also helps establish just how inexperienced jon is with women and how different free folk females are from their southofthewall counterparts  ghosts absence i dont have a problem with this he goes missing all the time in the books and thats what theyre establishing hes a direwolf not a pet ghost chooses to be with jon as do all the other living stark direwolves nymeria shadows arya i do wish theyd do more of this in the series but theres plenty of time  jamie  alton alton says something to the effect of being a distant lannister by taking that into consideration with the rest of his tale he is of low birth and that means not a real lannister i have no problem with jamie killing him were already seeing the beginning of his arch with this scene and everything he says to alton then his speech to cat about all the conflicting oaths and he saved the seven kingdoms when he killed aerys but no one can see that so his bitterness is justified jamie doesnt know the future he doesnt think hell get caught so his plan at the time is sound he also knows hes running out of time  hes in a pen not a secure dungeon like the book that could be breached by some drunken idiot with a burning desire to kill him at any moment there must be bowmen in robbs army why wouldnt he do everything in his power to escape to not do so would be totally out of character having this scene also gives cat more reason to let him go otherwise hes going to get ripped up by the camp before robb returns and poof there goes her best way of getting her daughters back going forward cleos really was just dead weight in the briennejamie story line which is why grrm kills him off in the books  jamie confessing in front of cat  brienne he did in the books so im not understanding why people have a problem with this just because hes not drunk in the dungeons of riverrun while doing so matters little in the long run cat letting jamie go really has more to do with getting arya and sansa back so her getting the news of bran  rickon after releasing him gives her even more justification for her actions i dont see cat cutting off jamies hand because that would mean jamie and brienne cant have their mutual asskicking scene later on when theyre taken by the brave companions thats a huge point for jamies character development about how he sees brienne i cant see how they skip that having brienne escort jamie alone reinforces just what a baddass she is  tyrion  cersei in the books tyrion knows and cersei knows he knows to play otherwise in the series would be to dumbdown one of these characters and be a gross disservice and insulting giving them that scene does three things 1 it gives cersei a biggerbetter arch by making her more three dimensional than just being onenote evil i think its important to differentiate between the joffrey degree of evil and her they are two different people 2 it gave tyrion that magic moment of wanting needing and instinctually going to comfort her and discovering where the invisible caution  do not cross yellow tape was in the book he touches her she recoils and we know his hurt because that chapter is through his eyes we dont have that internal luxury on film 3 it gives more buildup to just how insane and evil joffrey is and that everyone with a functioning brainstem knows it  dany theyre giving her a lot more to do than they did in cok stealing the dragons gives another note to give me what i need right now that is danys only objective in cok which is too repetitive and onenote for the tv series theyre also setting up the house of the undying and a justifiable reason for dragon woopass  robb  lying lady talisa in the book robbs marriage comes as a shock this way we see why and we get to see more robb that is winwin for the shows ability to tell the narrative vs the books  bran rickon  the reeds ill bet were not going to see bran  rickon again until the last episode so many nonbook peeps will believe theyre dead with everyone getting raven scrolls about theon killing them to reinforce this and this season will end with the four of them exiting the crypts of winterfell minus the reeds just like the book next season they can meet up with the reeds because they need to separate bran and rickon somehow and need someone other than hodor to look out for bran this way they give osha more screen time before she disappears with rickon and the overall narrative stays the same things i am missing that i think are needed at some point  the reeds  can wait for next season  ser dontos for all the sansa escape stuff  but there really is plenty of time for this since its very repetitive in the books and could wait until next season  the cache of dragonglass at the fist  since jon has already gone north they can wait for this until next season really especially since its more the slayers story than jons  weasel  how are they going to do weasel soup ill miss that if it doesnt happen but they could get the same outcome with other events there are three main scenes i thought when i read the book that they had to have this season and would spend  on  the riot which was only missing horses  which is fine and impossible to film without hurting someone with horses in that space  the house of the undying she has reinforced this with her claim this season of my dreams come true  the battle of the blackwater  just hope they dont skip tyrions chain i still have faith"

"Dio Forel",2012-05-14,"book interests are entirely different than hbo show interests as far as revelations with thousands of pages we have more than enough time to worry about eye color and who a character really is and all these different mysteries to solve there is no time to have a show progress in such a short amount of time and then expect it to benefit the viewer experience by including all these flashbacks and sidestories sidestories with regard to the show because fact is we would never have enough time to be able to really enjoy the results for those saying its not enough to say its an adaptation i just disagree i agree with the frustration because there is so much i would love to see on screen after my experience with the books but i know the time allotted would never accommodate that notion but the fact is a tv show has to have added elements to attract a wider demographic for this shows survival its not a book where you can survive with less readers and still finish the series its a tv show that without attracting more and more people from all walks of life we will never come close to seeing the onscreen ending some changes just have to be made because we have no time for 20 povs look how rushed it looked having what 5 povs in an episode some things have to be sacrificed and look how boring danys storyline is in the books to the point where people almost murder eachother going insane on how little progress she makes so how would the writers of the show expect to have that little happen and keep viewers with a character like dany people are now so enthralled with they had to add story to her world or else we would all hang ourselves watching those scenes and whats wrong with making some twists so that we as readers can have the potential luxury of watching an episode and not knowing exactly whats going to happen every step of the way i love not always knowing where theyre going who the hell wanted to go see the sixth sense if somebody had the shocker ruined for them that bruce willis is really dead the show is a twist on a phenomenal backing story i dont want to have a checklist of 100 things and cross them off in order 1 after the order when they happen i want the possibility of new things happening for us sadly i feel like the whole world of flashbacks and hidden meaningsprophecies is just way too much for a limited tv airing to convey so we will just miss out on most of it until the books address it all theres no care whatsoever about jons mother on the show or figuring out the truth of a lot of things we go through in the books it sucks but its expected as for what happens with alton who cares he was a made up character anyway and it was not out of character of jamie in the slightest bit jamie is an arrogant selfish prick lol he did as is expected for his own survival with cersei saying joff is a monster basically but then saying oh yeah why would she call if he is killed theres a little bit of a difference between saying yeah my son has turned into a sadistic ahole and saying i dont care if my son is murdered the negative here i feel like is just the whole season we came into this season expecting some greatness about the direwolves but where the hell are they wheres the warging concept we could certainly benefit from using more time on showing these storylines in conclusion enough anger that the show isnt as epic as the books there is not enough time for the epic to be told on screen and never will be the second we accept this is the second we can sit back and just enjoy the show i dont recall hearing people care about the variations to xmen or avengers as venomously as asoiaf readers seem to care about the differences here accept the very definition of based on my main concern here is making sure grrm finishes our books these shows are a great way to get me through my time waiting be happy guys its not like the writers butchered the show like eragon got butchered ruining that phenomenal series this is a great show"

"Dio Forel",2012-05-14,"which goes back to my original idea of the hobbit not being all that pricier it is when looked at per hour of viewing but not necessarily in the aggregateyes but its relevant because that ridiculously large amount of money enables the ability for more effects more characters and props more companies lining up to do work on the show and for the show and the fact that people will be paying every single time they go see the hobbit means more money to be made to compensate for the money spent got doesnt have that luxury and its a bigggggg difference between 70 million and 500 million lol its like the diff between a crappy 10k used car and a gorgeous 70k car ahhh if only this show had that kinda money to spend of course with the hobbit they have that other luxury of having lots of characters but basically it all revolves around one or 2 groupsparties its kinda like stuff is happening we just dont see it or care unlike our got where we are part of 7048 diff aspects of the story i cant imagine what lotr wouldve been like if we hopped around from rohan to the shire to the elven forest and all different povs back and forth itd be impossible to cover all that but lotr never really focused on all of that those other areas and storylines were passing thru points and minor moments asoiaf makes every aspect part of our experience and thats why its so difficult to put into a show or a movie but wow if we actually had the time to show everything with more episodes and longer episodes thered be no naysayers well maybe a few but itd all be for good reasons not for things thatd be resolved if we had more time and money"
"johnnysd",2012-05-14,"in a lot of ways i almost felt like this episode was specifically designed to shock people who read the books there were at least three occasions where i sat back in total surprisei liked the qarth changes a lot danys time in qarth was rather boring in the books so im glad theyre actually having things happen there in the tv show xaro and pyat prees coup was believable and it establishes them as serious and credible threats for dany im really looking forward to seeing the house of the undying next episodei also like the dynamic between tywin and arya its absolutely brilliant character interaction i dont think its as outofcharacter for tywin as people think hes in private with a lowly serving girl it makes sense hed let his guard down a little bit i can definitely see how arya would remind him of cersei too i dont think these scenes make tywin look weak either hes always made it very clear to arya that hes her master hes a master who can be kind to his servants when they serve him well but hes still careful to make sure they dont get too comfortable around him in my opinion this is completely consistent with the way tywin was portrayed in the bookswhat happened with jaime on the other hand i have very mixed feelings about it on the one hand it was incredibly welldone i was suckered right along with alton into thinking that jaime was a decent guy trying to be friendly i felt like id been punched in the gut when the poor sap got murdered which is a lot more than i felt when cleos frey died in the books i can see why nikolaj costerwaldau said it was the best scene hed ever done and im inclined to agree with him in terms of writing acting and directing it was a superb scenemy problem with the scene is that it effectively makes it impossible for jaime to have a convincing redemption arc as he does in the books this version of jaime is a coldblooded sociopath hes about as close to irredeemable as you can get unless they completely change around his role later in the series i dont see how this characterization could possibly work in the long runalso they had jaime kill karstarks son during his escape rather than on the battlefield it makes sense for a tv show since itd be hard to build a plot around something that happened offcamera last season but it makes karstarks attitude seem a lot more sympathetic and reasonable i know jaime killed some riverrun guards in the books too but that was never why karstark hated him im also baffled by their choice to have catelyn free jaime before she finds out about bran and rickons deaths that was the one mitigating factor that made her decision understandable the way the shows portrayed things id be on karstarks sidefor the vast majority of non book readers i suspect throwing a 10 year boy out of a window is far worse than killing a really remote relative to try and escape"

in the show its a spurofthemoment decision brought on by karstarks imminent murder of jaime telling robb the whole greyjoy idea was a bad plan rather than just sending theon again making her smarter than in the books because she was obviously rightread the books again because thats exactly what she does in there robb tells her of his plan to send an envoy to the iron islands she tells him that she does not trust balon greyjoy because he is not trustworthy then she tells him that if he must send someone he should at least send anyone other than theon in the show they kept the first part wordforword i think but cut the latter part which is kind of the most important aka that shes rightly doubting theons loyalty and reminding robb of his duties when hes flirting with the medic and being irresponsiblein the books hes not flirting in front of her so im not sure how you expect her to remind him of his responsibilities when hes hundreds of miles away and her reaction on the show was pretty tame especially when right before her responsibility speech she was smiling up at him with a conspiratorial look shes not just some dumb woman in the show far from itif youre implying that shes dumb in the books i would suggest that you reevaluate your opinion of her in the books because she is anything but to say otherwise is really an insult to the great actress who plays her so stronglyi have said nothing against michelle fairley whom i find to be very talented i only wish she had a better script to work with its funny you should say that shes only there to point out a stereotype while she has brienne the badass at her side in almost every scene loli dont see what that has got to do with anything its like saying that hanging around brienne would make cat taller i think briennes portrayal on the show is quite good so far but that doesnt impact on cats portrayal at all honestly i think they have butchered the character on the show in an effort to pander to the haters they have taken anything remotely controversial ie interesting about the character and turned her into a great big blob of nothing if youve ever taken part in a cat argument on the forums before youll probably have noticed that people usually dislike or hate her for the same reasons the it should have been you line she tells jon when he tries to say goodbye to bran changed to the much tamer i want you to leaveadvising ned to go south which some people think somehow caused his death in the show she only ever asks him to stayarresting tyrion and singlehandedly starting the war of the five kings it remains untouched mostly because its a pivotal plotpointnot going home to winterfell like a good mother in the show she stays at robbs side because he tells her to and keeps complaining that her place is in winterfell and not in robbs campfreeing jaime and betraying robb now theyre making her look like shes preventing karstarks treason rather than committing her ownso out of the 5 main reasons people usually have for hating cat and make no mistake cat is probably the mostreviled pov character in the series besides cersei they have changed 4 the worse part is that it validates all the criticism laid out against her while most of it is completely ridiculous and unfounded not only that they have also given most of her decisions or ideas to other people  paying homage to renly becomes robbs idea freeing jaime is done out of littlefingers influence and karstarks threats sneaking out of renlys camp becomes briennes idea etc and instead of having her kill a man during the attack on the vale she cowers in a corner for the entire scene i would suggest that the writers are much more sexist than me here rant over"

"wolverine",2012-05-15,"the show continues to make catelyn a much more intelligent rational likeable character they have now stripped her of most of her blunders from the book other than capturing tyrion on lf word"
"wolverine",2012-05-15,"i am utterly baffled by the suggestions that tyrions chain would be too expensive to do this is a show that has very frequent shots of living breathing dragonsare we watching the same show"
"Evamitchelle",2012-05-15,"when shes obviously portraying catelyn as a strong intelligent woman and not the dumb woman stereotype who should be an example women should stay at home yet it is claimed shes failing at her attempt i find that to be rather demeaning saying her portrayal is a sexist stereotype is completely ignoring her standing up to karstark you dont have to say so explicitlyhow being given a great responsibility by her king while he could rely on countless men to do his bidding yet he finds her the best person for the job is sexist is beyond mein the show they make it seem inevitable that she would have to release jaime because he was going to get killed and make her decision smart they make it look like she is doing a good job while robb is away not sitting around like a sexist stereotype that would not be able to make a decision without a man by her side rather than make her decision completely emotional rather than logical whether you like this twist or not is up to you but its not sexist at all it shows cat to be a strong shrewd woman who is able to make the most of a very difficult situationthe exact wording is irrelevant the show retains the basic value of the scene catelyn warned robb against doing something she thought to be dumb he didnt listen catelyn was right robb was wrong how is this sexist its merely 1 shortening the scene 2 avoiding having to explain the whole theon being a hostage thing again something a lot of people who only watch the show might not have understood  remembered  even seenim not talking about the books im talking about that scene where robbs flirting shes polite when jeyne is there and it only makes sense shes smart enough not to make a huge scene to robb in front of his men imagine how bad for morale it would be for soldiers to see their king berated by his mummy like a little kid cat handled this situation well and again her intelligence shows as opposed to robbs it seems to be a recurring theme youd be blind not to see iti agree with you she is not dumb which is why i didnt say she was dumb see it can be that easy if you want my opinion on book cat it would be that while i may not agree with everything shes done people often forget she just lost her friggin husband and children and is bound not to be at her best and often had very little time to make decisions capturing tyrion as a counterweight to the hostages the lannisters virtually had still seems like a good decision to me and again people forget how little time she had to react after tyrion confronted her and how it thus wasnt her initial plan but thats for another threadif i were a sexist screen writer and i wanted scenes that showed the inferiority of women i would not have a hulking badass like brienne in the background who proves the opposite of what im trying to prove by her mere presence so briennes presence does mattershe didnt partake in the action when the hillmen attacked thats true but she did fight off the youre not supposed to be here dude a scene that no doubt created a lot of respect for her which i would have definitely taken out and given solely to the wolf if i were a sexist screenwritermaking her less controversial is again not sexist its happened to all the characters even freakin tywin shows moments of humanityyou think its sexist brienne takes decisive action rather than catelyn showing brienne can keep a cool head after the horrible thing that happened to her err yeah well then brienne is a woman how substituting one smart action by a woman by a brave and smart action by another woman is sexist is again beyond meyour huge defense rant of cat is meaningless because i havent said whether i liked or didnt like the character you were saying hurr durr the show writers are sexist they should have perhaps chosen another tale than asoiaf a series with a lot of strong female characters to write for thenfirst things first i have always refrained from throwing the word sexism around when discussing the shows portrayal of cat this was actually the first instance and youll notice i only said it twice one paraphrasing you and only because youre the one who cried sexism when i voiced my dislike of cats portrayal on the show there are 11 instances of the word in your post plus your original attack you should probably tone it down a bit as it stands every one of your arguments against me relies on my one implication that i find the writers more sexist than me which makes your entire post rather strawmany i never said that every change on its own was sexist im only saying that viewed as a whole the final picture isnt very pretty while i do not particularly find showcat a sexist stereotype your words here not mine on her own she definitely suffers from the comparison with bookcat if id watched the show first i dont think i would have been particularly put off by anything in her story line its seeing what theyve chosen to change from her narrative that makes me very dubious as to the writers intentions as for your claim that removing cats advice was done because viewers would not remember theons situation i think its pretty insulting to their intelligence that you think it likely theyd forget a character who has been in 9 out of 10 episodes in the first season especially since he reminds them at least once per scene that he is not a stark only their wardhostage besides its not like they know who balon greyjoy is at that point also choosing to focus on a 3word sentence i put in parentheses instead of focusing on the rest of my argument was not the greatest idea my point was that catelyn was able to successfully predict theons betrayal when no one else was showing that she was an adequate judge of character and had a good mind for politics it would have added about 10 seconds to the scene and the reason i dislike this change so much is that all the other advice she gives in the books has been stripped as well she does not plead for peace when robb is named king in the north she does not show to him that paying renly homage is important she does not warn him against theon as for all the characters becoming more sympathetic lets compare jaime and cerseis portrayal in this episode since they are after all supposed to be the same person in two bodies jaime finds himself in a cell with his distant cousin alton lannister probably half his age and an old squire of his they fondly reminisce about that time when they were squires and jaime tells him that he did very well in his role then he bashes his head him with his fists out of selfpreservation and strangles a young guard with his chains he spends the rest of the episode trying to piss off anyone who ever talks to him nothing of the sort happened in the books except the killing a guard part but he did with a sword and not his bare hands compare that to cerseis actions who imparts some womanly wisdom to sansa she reminisces about jaime and robert aloud then she has a small oneonone with tyrion where she muses about her past sins and joffreys morality nothing of the sort happened in the books its also important to note that cersei had a stillborn baby with robert instead of a voluntary abortion that she used to have feelings for him for about a year while she should have started hating his guts on the night of their wedding and never ordered the murder of babies and small children like she did in the books it doesnt take a genius to see that cersei has been softened quite a bit or made more sympathetic as the writers would say a similar thing seems to be happening to shae who is mostly acting out of selfinterest in the books but is in the show ready to incur the queens heart to protect the tearful teenager gods forbid a woman be unlikable amirite  being sexist isnt always restricted to thinking all women are inferior to men you know fandom usually has no problem with characters like arya asha and brienne because they occupy traditionally male roles aka the role of a fighter its especially easy to see when comparing peoples reaction to arya and sansa the former is a cocky plucky tomboy who talks back to armoured men twice her size wants to become a fighter instead of a lady and eventually joins a group of superpowered assassins the latter is traditionally feminine crushes on boys likes pretty dresses and romantic songs about true love unsurprisingly arya is ranked at 3 on the tower of the hands top 30 characters while sansa is at 18 but also makes an appearance on the most hated list and is routinely berated for being passive useless or simply a bitchand once again your last paragraph confuses me i really dont see why you think my entire post was based on what i perceived your opinion to be it doesnt really matter if you like her or not which is why i never brought up the subject similarly i havent really talked about my feelings towards the character though i think it shows pretty obviously since all youve managed to get out of my post is that i think the screenwriters are sexist hur durr durr let me explain more clearly my problem with cats adaptationfor one thing i absolutely do not understand why the writers would feel the need to make her character more sympathetic to the viewers if someone is incapable of feeling sympathy for a woman who loses her husband her two sons and two daughters and witnesses the murder of her last remaining child before going mad and having her throat slit i would suggest that the problem lies with them and not the character by changing the elements of her story line that most of her detractors agreed on they are validating their complaints and making it the correct interpretation when they change her active decision to remain with robb instead of going with her younger sons and have her repeat ad nauseam that her place is in winterfell they are agreeing with it and saying that a good mothers place is at home with the children and not in a military camp when they change her motivations for freeing jaime turning it from her betraying robb to her preventing karstarks betrayal they are implying that she was wrong to disobey her teenage sons wishes then they are getting rid of every piece of advice she ever had stripping the character of an important layer of characterization catelyn was raised as the heir to riverrun until edmures birth and was the lady of winterfell for 15 years as a result she has developed a good mind for politics and is capable of giving great advice in times of war advising to keep theon close was a good idea making peace with the lannisters would have been a god idea bending the knee to renly would have been a good idea etc but everyone around her ignores her because she is 1 a woman aka the gentle sex who knows nothing of war and 2 a middleaged by westeros standards mother and kings dont hide behind their mothers skirts despite all that hostility she still chooses to hang in there and speak her damn mind and even though she does miss her younger sons she never expresses the desire to go home to robb though she believes she can help her eldest in a meaningful way and fights to remain at his side in the end all she gets in thanks is a forced vacation to seaguard with lord mallister so robb can keep playing the king the show makes her much more passive in that way because she doesnt even give any politicalmilitary advice anymore and because she is shown to be staying against her will bookcat wanted to stay with robb which is why she sent ser rodrik back to winterfell and named him castellan showcat is forced to stay with robb and it is therefore him who orders ser rodrik back to winterfell maybe you think its only a minor decision but with all the other changes it becomes a trend rather than an isolated element so basically dd have taken out this whole dimension to her story line where she has to fight the gross misogyny around her to make herself heard tldr  showcat isnt so bad on her own but the comparison to bookcat makes her look passive indecisive and unoriginal thus making me question dds ability to portray female characters that do not fall into the tomboy or ice queen tropes"

"boojam",2012-05-15,"actually theres no need for speculation because i just remembered that sansas age is given right in the first episode of the series cersei asks her how old she is and sansa answers that shes 13 which means that she is now 14 and that arya was probably 11 but now 12seems to me  on the show they have stopped giving explicit ages to the child actors or at least i wish they would stop it since if this show goes into a fourth season all the former child actors will be late age teenagers another season or two and they will be young adults"

"StannisandDaeny",2012-05-15,"first things first there was no attack in my post get that idea out of your head thanks now then throwing the word sexism around is virtually the same thing as making the very extreme and wrong statement showcat is just a reminder that a woman should be at home with her babies the final picture is made by all those small changes so me addressing them one by one especially since you brought them up is no more than logicali do not particularly find showcat a sexist stereotypethen how she could possibly be just a reminder that a woman should remain at home with her babies i gave different options for it since i as opposed to you dont think i can see inside the minds of the screenwriters even following your trail of thought the logical conclusion would still be they did not find it necessary to repeat the fact theon is a hostage not they want to make cat seem unimportant and dumb given your faith in the intelligence of the audience im sure youll agree theyll be smart enough to put 2 and 2 together and realize cat saying it is a bad idea entails both not trusting balon and not trusting theon or that she did not trust theon but thought it smarter to question balons loyalty to get her point across than doubt robbs good friend or that they want the audience to think for themselves and maybe say hmm maybe cat wasnt too fond of theon to begin with look back and watch the episodes again for clues you see many possible theories but no out of all possible options it has to be we want to make cat seem dumb an irrelevantas for jaime some of the audience may be shocked but im pretty sure a lot of them will find him badass because of that scene as well sympathy can be gained on different levels and a lot of people have weird tasteyes cersei and shae are way nicer in the series it wasnt very difficult to do however both of them are still pretty iffy and in shaes case it doesnt even make much sense thats what im saying as for unlikeable women now that i think of it melisandre is pretty unlikeable in the show compared to the book and margaery doesnt appear very nice either especially not as innocent as she was in the book whory and vainglorious more likely of course you can hardly speak of this in absolutes because opinions will differ on that again though rather than attribute it to hurr woman cannot be unlikeable they have to fit in a nice little frame you could also think positively and attribute this to the show wanting to stress the fact there are no wholly evil or wholly good characters something grrm really stresses on even in interviews something that is easier to get across in the books through their thoughts and the masses of information you get compared to a little bit of screentimethe characters popularity among fans is obsolete to the screenwriters intentions which were discussing i dont see why you brought that upfrom your huge defence of cat and your assumption i was implying she was dumb i took it you thought i was a cathater it may not have been very relevant but i thought id point it out im not a cathater on the contrary while i was at itrobb tells cat not to go home in the show i interpret that as cat is competent she doesnt have to go home because she is too freakin important that makes her appear much smarter than when she stays of her own will and then fucks up as in being wrong the jaime would have died and had no more purpose anyway argument you can make in the show quickly turns that aroundit could be that i just dont remember it but the scene where catelyn stands up to karstark is showonly as i recall it why make up an extra scene like that when youre only trying to put cat downcatelyn was simplified but then not one show character has been as complete as it was in the books it simply seems to me youre paying more attention to her missing scenes than any others the basis is still there shes clearly a strongwilled woman who does give good advice even if she didnt say everything she said in the books and is counted upon and im sure most people especially those who havent read the books will see her that way if you dont like her in the adaption thats all up to you but dont blame it on sexism because thats just ridiculous asoiaf is like the worst series you could ever use to attempt to get a sexist message across lol a lot of what you say has nothing to do with the screenwriters anyway but are simply things that happen in the story regardless and can be brought down to the fact that westeros just isnt a very nice place for women or people in general i could be here complaining about how jon snow is a complete pussy in the show who gets repeatedly owned by ygritte as well as everyone else and bring that down to sexism as well but since it makes little sense to me id rather look for other less nonsensical reasons edited by stannisanddaeny 15 may 2012  1231 pm"
"Arya The Assassin",2012-05-15,"a dialogueheavy episode but the dialogue was for the most part quite interesting episode 6 was more exciting thoughgoodmaisies best scene so far with charles dance the interesting thing is that arya didnt actually meet tywin like this in the novel iirc but it still works and it makes sense that she feels tempted to kill tywin this scene not only represents an opportunity for the writers to make their own minor changes to the screen adaptation but it also gives maisie some screentime and an opportunity to show her acting skillsthe scene with tyrion and cersei another scene that i dont remember from the novel but still fits in with the rest of the story it was a nice interesting touch to let tyrion show a hint of sympathy for her sobbing sister and see cerseis reaction as if she was saying im crying and need some comfort but not from youbadthe scene with the kingslayer and the other guy in the pen this scene dragged on for too long especially when considering the relative unimportance of the scene they could have cut to the climax of the scene much earlier without all the filler dialogue its the first time in this season that i feel that a scene is way too long"
"Buckwheat",2012-05-15,"there wasnt too much blood far from it if she had been bleeding for an hour it should look like that its superficial really never had an accident like that before assuming youre a girlyup i am a girl and still think there was too much blood for her first time i have always heard girls saying that the first time there was almost nothing you say she might have been bleeding for an hour but they show that much blood that she could have been bleeding the whole week at least in my experiencei think the blood on her legs and some smaller stains on her gown and sheets would have told it quite sufficietly and much more realistic"
"dab0neman",2012-05-15,"the reason this show has to be different this season and beyond is precisely what youve said book one largely stays in a very few locations and the stories are not so deeply intertwined and interdependent on each other eg the starkswinterfell and danykahl drohgo if you really think about it there is more like 25 to 3 books so far if you consider that the events of books 2 3 4 and 5 overlap each other story lines and minor characters will of course have to be chopped off im really liking that the overall story archs are being preserved while the characters are getting a chance to break out of their trite portrayals tywin is a father to three children and hes fighting a war to secure their future i think him smiling a bit and acting the somewhat loving parent to arya is an awesome addition to him and deepens his background anyone can play the sourfaced evil king character but when you throw in scenes like the feeding of arya you make him more whole and complexthe books are the books there are time constraints as well as audienceentertainment sensibilities to consider not everyone has read the books and piling on character after character plot after plot scheme after scheme would leave the average hbo joe scratching his head every sunday night i think theyre doing it right by slowly progressing the main story points hacking away the boring crap and changing it up where it would make some sense in a real world weseteros theyve got a season or two more to really hook us and i hope they get as much time as they need to tell the story who knows maybe we wont have to wait for grrm to finish it well see a book 6 on screen firsteven though i am really happy that got was made into a series i think that benioffweiss have unfortunately bit off more than they could chew heres whyin season 1 there were less characters and although there was still a lot of background that made the story complicated and perhaps a bit difficult to understand for nonreaders it worked background info such as cotf first men andals targaryen history the many gods in the series are what i am referring to what helped make season 1 more cohesive was the fact that ned stark was the center of the storm so to speak he was the loveable patriarch of a noble family and most of the events derived from him  roberts offering him the position of hand which meant that his queen and jaime were in winterfell etc etc neds being there set off a bunch of chain reactions and once he agreed to be roberts hand all the plotting started the only characters who were not really surrounding ned stark in the plot were viserys and dany they were also separated geographically however the writers did a good job of explaining why they were in exile and what they were trying to accomplishonce ned was executed all hell broke loose and i mean that in a couple of ways firstly people who hadnt read the books were shocked and pissed that the main character of the series had been killed secondly it accelerated the war of the 5 kings thirdly and most importantly i observed a splintering effect of the storyline  now instead of a plot that is very texturedincludes subplots but is basically still about ned and his family as well as dany it became a hundred different storylinesone thing that struck me forcefully was how much each episode of season 2 skips around in the first season each episode seemed like it spent much more time on each character and the cut from one scene to another was seamless and wellsegued this season it runs sort of like this two minutes with theon hunting the boys  cut  one minute with branrickonoshahodor going towards a village  cut  dany trying to find her dragons for two minutes  cut  sansa talking with the hound for 1 minute  cut  arya and tywin lannister talking for 3 minutes incredibly uncharacteristically btw  he even smiles a couple of times  cut  sansa gets her period and talks with cersei for two minutes  cut  jaime maunders on with a character  alton  who wasnt in the books for four minutes strangles him and a karstark son escapes  cut  tyrion and cersei have a hearttoheart even though tyrion has already delivered the infamous line of your joy will turn to ashes in your mouthum what  cut  etc etc etci didnt want to generalize before i had seen more than half of series 2 but this fragmented style of filming book 2 is disorienting and annoying i understand that this might seem natural because there are 5 kings in the land so naturally everyone will be all over the place but what happens when even more characters are added as the series progresses will we only see half a minute of each character unable to savor the longer interactions we enjoyed in season 1 it appears that although the adaptation of the books to tv is wellintentioned there might be an inevitable downward spiral of fragmentation because of the growing cast the growing complexity of the plot and the unnecessary scenes they add to the show perfect example why on earth did they steal danys dragons if they hadnt made that decision there would have been extra time to use for longer scenes with the charactersaside from that my opinion of episode 7 is much like it has been for all the other episodes thus far  i am left dissatisfied unfortunately the only high point for me was john  ygrittes interactions i love the actress playing her  shes got her character spoton and even though in the book i always hated it when she said you know nothing jon snow i thought the way she delivered that line was absolutely fantastic grim and not playful as i had always imagined"

"Ser Piggy Of The Baby Back Rib",2012-05-15,"i found this episode to be the most difficult for me to watch im having a hard time separating the books from the show ill admit i realize that some of it doesnt matter in the grand scheme of things but some of it just irks me the whole jon storyline and the quorin halfhand angle in particular for this episode i was assuming that hes meet up with them and hed have the talk about turning cloack to infiltrate the is your sword sharp jon snow line was one of the things i was really looking forward to im hoping that the halfhand has also been caputured and in the next episode jon has to kill him to convince them hes coming over if they make him out to be a turncloak in the show i will be very pissed the continuing daenerys rewrite is puzzling me more and more killing the remainder of the 13 just seems like its gratuitous its like they hadnt filled the blood and gore quota for the episode or something jaimes sudden vulnerable moment with his cousin was pointless to me i would have rather them spend that extra 4 minutes or so on his talk with catelyn so we could get the backstory on how brandon and lord rickard died and how he really became the kingslayer and how the rebellion started speaking to a lot of people who never read the books before watching they all of a sudden get a better appreciation when i provide some of the backstory that is missing from the shows this is one of those moments i believe i have also stopped hoping that meera and jojen would appear at some point im guessing they will meet them on the road north during season 3 they play such a major role in the bran storyline that i dont see how they completely cut it out"

"anaron",2012-05-15,"having seen 7 of 10 episodes i think im quite sure that i like the first season better because it has a more coherent feel dont get me wrong the second season is once more a gem but the segments are barely long enougth to get whats going on i suspect people not having read the books really have to pay attention i actually like the changes because they are very well set and make for surprises even if youve read the books exchanging the westerlings through some singular alluring exotic beauty was a clever move because it keeps the characterzoo a bit smaller and still serves the plot point putting tywin into harrenhal for an extended period also cuts back on nonessential characters and gives tywin and arya more screentime for characterdevelopment i really like the tywinaryascenes those two actors work so well together as for the tywin feeding arya scene i dont think tywin knows who the girl really is he for sure suspects that the girl is more than she seems though feeding her was no act of mercy he suspected the poisondart was meant for him and when he offered arya his meal my first thought was he tests her because he thinks someone very close to him might try to poison him having arya eat his meal checks if this meal might be poisened and has the girl think twice to either poison meals herself or accept a bribe to do so if she has to fear having to eat the occasional meal herself she might even look out for people tempering with my lords food thats how i think tywin would think the highbornquestion is him probing who this not so ordinary girl might really be im looking forward to how far the writers will go with this twist i suspect they will have tywin find out aryas real identity which will force her to flee from the castle in the way portrayed in the books at that point this additional peace of knowledge for tywin would have no serious repercussions for later events jonygritte works very well too ygritte was one of my favorites in the books and i really hated it when and how she died i think the writers blew her part up at this point because it was a given that shell be a favorite and because in all the gloom going on shes a bright spot that counterweigths all the seriousness a little also she transports a lot of exposition about wildlingbackground and motivation that is scattered over many pages in the books the quarthstoryline is much more interesting than in the books i really like what theve done there though id not have had dany go as weak as she does when loosing her dragons the changed quarth this leaves behind makes no differences as far as the books go so far edited by anaron 15 may 2012  0107 pm"

"A Clash of Crows",2012-05-15,"let us make this clear the show is not the books the books are the books if you love the story in the books so much that watching a different story truly upsets you then reread the books think for a moment about how unreasonable it is to be mad when a different medium ends up being different reasons why this was the best episode to date  charles dance tywin is staring to prove that he is the most talented actor on the show his scenes with arya have been absolutely outstanding the growing tension we viewers feel in those scenes around aryas identity is incredible and im really enjoying being tricked into liking tywin also the show has so few oppertunites to get the history of westeros in unless the characters talk about it  the jaime escape scene is a really nice nod to the style of the books even if that scene doesnt actually take place the characters in the books especially the lannisters use their superior command of language and conversation to make their moves for the throne the show has a difficult time doing that because of time think about how abbreviated the conversation between tyrion and janos slynt was when he got him to admit his betrayal of ned stark they really let jaime be jamie in that scene to make his move the way bookjamie would have  people have found the ygrittejon scenes to be slow but not only is she extremely funny but their conversations are doing a nice job of getting the history in that is perfectly set up for what jon has to do next  as they said in the inside the episode piece that scene between tyrion and cersei was incredible she has nobody else to talk to but her brother but she hates him her brother has a desire to comfort her but it feels awkward the lannisters have so much depth to them now instead of a black and white distinction of evil over good one can almost pity her in that moment  i actually thought the qarth chapters in the book were pretty boring im enjoying those scenes way more in the show the fact that one can easily guess that the burned bodies are not bran and rickon is a little disappointing but the reveal is going to be so much quicker in this format than the books there would only be what two episodes where you thought they were dead still this was a weak point in the show especially since they were trying to make such an epic moment out of it and didnt quite get there edited by a clash of crows 15 may 2012  0153 pm"

"Currawong",2012-05-15,"jaimes sudden vulnerable moment with his cousin was pointless to me i would have rather them spend that extra 4 minutes or so on his talk with catelyn so we could get the backstory on how brandon and lord rickard died and how he really became the kingslayer and how the rebellion started 1 the tv audience doesnt need a double dose of how brandon and rickard died  jaime has already told that tale to ned in season 1 so we do not need to waste any time on it in season 2 especially if jaime is also going to tell that story to brienne in season 3 2 the jaime alton conversation was very good especially when you listen to what jaime was saying about youthful dreams and ideals the dialogue was not just a setup for the murder but also a great insight into jaimes own character and how the knight of his boyhood dreams has now become kingslayer i know there are often complaints whenever an episode shows slow scenes with just dialogue but often the key action or character developent is through dialogue scenes a tv show cannot rely on extensive exposition or pov memories as in grrms books so that sometimes lengthy sections of dialogue play a critical role you just have to pause listen and hear what is being said"

"Warden of the North121",2012-05-15,"i think season 1 was a lot easier to adapt in comparison to season 2 because most of the main characters were in kings landing except for dany jon and bran this made last season seem less choppy and easier to film i kind of figured season 2 would suffer from this but i still think theyve done really well excellent tv certainly better than the crap they have on tv these days"

"Lyana",2012-05-15,"well it is safe to say that this episode was almost as great as the last one lets start in order of appearance theon made a good impression in this episode but not as good as in the last one somehow this was supposed to be the shocking scene with brans and rickons corpses but it didnt have a big impact on me of course ive read the books and for some pages i actually thought the boys are really dead so maybe im being a bit subjective on that one alfie is still doing a great job but he was more impressive in the previous episode imo here comes one of the highlights for me  the jonygrittemoments those two are my new favourite couple  they are just hilarious ive read lots of posts how those scenes are too extended i would have to disagree on this one not only the scenes are setting the jonygritte relationship but they also show the huge differences between the wildlings and the nw it makes the viewers also wonder  did ygritte do all those sexual hints intentionally or she was just trying to get jon into her trap plus we get some funny jokes abot jons blue balls there must be something for the ladies too winkpng classbbcemoticon alt  i had some concerns about the jonqhorininteraction but the more i read this thread the sooner those worries got away so im waiting for the important scene in ep10 according to the previews i also hope they have some good excuse besides budget about the missing ghost the tywinarya interactions were another favourite moment have always been since they started i have to say this again  im not a tywinfan but charles dance is really outstanding perhaps this whole dialog with arya could be outofcharacter for the booktywin but it fits the tv showcharacter for the best we get some background story abot aegon and his sisters an awesome wideshot of harrenhall and the wondering what does tywin suspects of arya  what more does one want i have to admit  not much into the whole sansanstory ive just started to read the feast so cant really say much about that sansas scenes are heartbreaking as always shae defending her was a bit odd and kind of a riddle to me  hopefully the show gets somewhere with that cant complain about the cerseisansa scene though the scenes with robb were ok it was necessary to set up him leaving the camp in this episode i expect to see more of him and his mysterious lady in the next episodes i got goosebumps by the look jane and roose shared not sure what to say about the whole qarthstoryline on one side is good to hear daenerys finally talking with some common sence in her conversation with jorah finally thinking and not just threatening to burn everything she finally realizes that the people in westeros are not just waiting for her with the red carpet on the other side this distrust hints to turn into some dangerous paranoia perhaps the show is better with the changes they made to make daenerys storyarc somehow interesting but will we get to the hou any soon please jaime lannister was the nice surpise in this episode i disagree that his scenes were out of character for all the reasons already mentioned in this thread during his dialog with cat i almost thought for a moment that he will reveal the real reason why he killed aerys his honesty is overwhelming and liberating at the same time he is an extremely interesting character in the books and i believe nikolaj is going to carry out the complexity of his character during the next season too sad that we saw too little of tyrion but really happy that we have a break from littlefinger cant wait for the next episode smilepng classbbcemoticon alt  edited spelling edited by lyana 15 may 2012  0905 pm"

"Dio Forel",2012-05-15,"sorry man this episode was so painful i have kind of lost hope for the rest of the series and as a preempt i am not a book purist but i do love the story and character dynamics and to be honest the hbo series has kind of wrecked a lot of the dynamic that was dear to me and can only be something vaguely similar in plot to asoiaf for me at this point and i thought season 1 was great what is great about the book series is after all the characters and their dynamics without this the series is just any other fantasy plot and grrm himself acknowledges this lets go over what was so wrong with episode 71 jaimeanderthal  his murder was extremely out of character for him some of you have been like zomgz but he kicked a babby out of a tower thats worse cuz babbys r cute please killing bran was an inescapable necessity for preserving his love life and the kingslayer part  need we mention aerys was a mad king who burned people alive in his throne room and was highly unfit to rule what jaime would do for love well i can tell you killing his cousin was not nor was it portrayed as such killing for love it was killing because he was greedy or evil  and that is completely out of character for him jaime is awesome and a great character has now been ruined2 tywinoryoudieoryougivearyayourdinner  a man who would have a full barracks of women rape a woman of lower class to prove to his son that all women of lower class are whores in that they want a lord for their money  this type of man would not give a serving girl his meal he would certainly not compare his daughter to a serving wench3 cerseiiously what happened to the selfentitled spoiled princess in her what happened to the one who in the future does very mean things to her brother she seemingly bonds with or is willing to cry in front of there is a reason why cersei actually crying for the first time in the series feel cathartic  and thats because she would never boohoo like she did in episode 74 ygrittemyteethinexasperation well lets let it slide that the actual development of the love story is butchered you know nothing jon snow was for me a metaphor for the clash of civilizations their impossible love tryst is not a metaphor for you aint never felt me warm wet soft innards ye crow to be quite blunt she came off more like a whore from in kings landing than an strong experienced battleworn independent wildling5 dontshaenuthintonobodyorillusethisbutterknifetomakeyoutoast for those of you who recall shaes later actions you know this was not only stupid of her but also out of character for her to try to save sansa how wrong is it to think of the unreal style announcement first blood during the sansa scene not to mention she really doesnt have any incentive to  shes a whoreservant since when did she have loyalty and fine fine fine she is a loyal whoreservant then please explain to me where this loyalty of hers goes in adod she is more loyal to a random princess she serves than a lord who has given her all of what she has and is even loyal to her or are they going to ruin that love story as wellso yeah as another preempt to the insecure anti criticism league i do like what the series overall did with greyjoy arya sansa brienne c aetlyn so please dont try to pull that this guy is just in a sour blue balls mood and is taking it out on the internet haterz gonna hate lines to dismiss any valid articulate criticisms of the hbo series particularly this season its dropped its standards pretty low not many quotes have me laughing before i reply in rebuttal but this one definitely did it1 the jaime aspect just lol are you out of your mind some little kid a helpless little kid sees me kissin my sister damn i gotta preserve my love so i gotta brutally murder him so he doesnt tattle on me dear god lol i am so glad i dont know you where you consider the attempted murder of the equivelant of an elementary school kid a justifiable casualty to avoid people knowing he is hitting it with his sister it is just as selfish not greedy because how the hell is there greed involved in escaping prison to kill your cousin to escape as it is to murder a kid so your acts of indiscretion go unnoticed ummmmmm be a man if you are man enough to get with your married twin sister you can be a man and suck it up when a kid catches you in the act something tells me that if i was cheating on my girlfriend and some little kid sees me and i push him into oncoming traffic a jury wont be like but wait he was acting to preserve his love um no it was being selfish you know the word to describe killing alton that you feel is so uncharacteristic saying hey i dont wanna be caught i wanna end some little kids potential to have his own life to save mine and my sisters asses again selfish btw 2 damn it with the tywin character assessments he isnt letting the girl run around free in the forests living in the lap of luxury he is clearly aware she is an upper class northerner lying about her identity he has alluded to knowing she is lying several times she is more valuable alive than dead and it would come in handy to have her in a more confused and vulnerable position strategically and again he is having random conversation with the girl offering her food not taking her on a vacation showering her with gold and gifts he is ruthless to those that are of no value to him strategically or in any possible way this cupbearer yeah being his slave is some special honor that defies his character has potential value and it would be very untywin like to pass up the opportunity to keep your enemies closer than your friends3 is it really that big of a stretch cersei losing it like this she has clearly in the books been shown to be at odds with joffreys decisions she went insane eventually and her being tormented inside with what her son has become would be a logical precursor to her ranting and insanity to come and how do you know she wouldnt cry logic dictates that a person who acts as she does very often is running from things she is battling inside you dont know her none of us do shes a character out of a book4 she definitely acts like a strong independent wildling she shows no fear or discretion in anything she says basically mocking her captor she speaks not like a whore but like a wildling shes crazy and in a lot of ways an outlaw she was mocking the guy i wont lie i havent really been a fan of this aspect of the show but i understand that a lot of it is for the tv crowd and entertainment value vs being loyal to the book storyline i dont love it but i understand it5 ummm what does it do as far as shaes future role in the books it further shows that there is the book series and the tv series and both have different arcs and demographics to please it is being a purist to expect every single character to be the same as in the book this is an adaptation we cant complain about some changes that dont make sense because they are using the books as a foundation with some aspects nothing morein conclusion please do not say this is hate against critique or any negative feedback i think negative feedback is just as important as positive feedback but lets be honest this wasnt logical or articulate this is another example of trying to seem like people welcome change then just go insane when its a change you didnt envision grrm approved all of the happenings in the show why cant we just accept that this show is not the books i didnt go crazy loving this episode but i promise you there were no bomb threats made anywhere on account of my frustration that the episode deviated from the books"
"ThePrinceOfSunspear",2012-05-15,"the show lost me the moment they tried to make the whore relevantand i mean shae im cool with ros im hope she and theon get together in the books but whatevs back to the imps whoreim so disgusted and just thrown off by what hbo is doing with shae shes nothing more than a minor character and yet the show keeps insisting on pushing her face on my screen and making it seem like shes gonna play some crucial role uhhhh no we all know what shae will do in the end and what happens to her as a result shes just a whore whores should be silent and out of the way unless called up to perform this show had some great 1 on 1 momentsits just so sad that all of them made no fucking sense in terms of the characters and the emotions they displayed as well as their actions save for sansa and the queen i would have given the episode a 1"

"Evamitchelle",2012-05-15,"snipat this point youve created this giant strawman argument around the idea that i find dd evil misogynists who spend their time plotting the best way to demean all women all the time i dont know what dd were thinking when they changed cats narrative but i remember at least one preview for season 2 where they said that the women of the series are the strong ones most likely they believe it too well i dont really give a shit what their intentions were intent doesnt matter only the end result does despite what you think i dont believe i can see inside the writers minds even if i could it wouldnt change my opinion because im basing my argument on the final product and not the original concept they could have started with the best intentions in the world or the worst the result would be the same and id still find their portrayal problematic for a number of reasons in the same way i dont really care what your opinion on cat is either though for what its worth i did think you liked the character but thats besides the point despite what youve said im still getting the idea that you find a lot of book cats actions pretty stupid since youve been repeating several times per post how shes so much smarter in the show not mentioning theon is smarter than doing so not harping robb about jeyne is smarter than saying something releasing jaime out of immediate necessity is smarter than choosing to do so on her own etc so basically you find a woman to be smarter when she shuts up rather than when she speaks up thats sexism with a velvet glove right there see how im not attacking you  â<U+0080><U+009C>that makes her appear much smarter than when she stays of her own will and then fucks upâ<U+0080><U+009D> when you say that she fucks up it seems a pretty clear indication to me that you thought she acted stupidly as for the scene with karstark no she never had a confrontation with karstark with weapons drawn but she had an earlier scene much like it except better that was not included in the show when renly is slain by the shadow a couple of guards and knights of the rainbow guard pour inside the tent and while brienne is busy fighting 2 or 3 men at once catelyn literally puts herself between her and ser robar royce catches his by the arm before he can draw his sword and not only does she convince him not to attack brienne she even manages to have him fight the other guards outside then she saves the unarmoured brienne from the steelclad ser emmon cuy by hitting him on the head with an iron brazier and unlike whats in the show she did it while alone in the middle of an enemy camp and not surrounded by her husband and sons men ie in much greater personal danger so excuse me if for not finding it spectacular when they deign to include toned down versions of her canon â<U+0080><U+009C>badassâ<U+0080><U+009D> scenes every once in a while its not making the female characters more sympathetic that i find problematic its the elements theyve chosen to alter in the story lines that make it so as ive already shown pretty much every reason people have for hating cat has been altered  shes not as mean to jon shes not as opinionated as in the books she wants to go to winterfell to be with bran and rickon she doesnt betray robb etc all of that basically boils down to  she should be a better mother ie not being as abrasive towards her teenage â<U+0080><U+009C>stepsonâ<U+0080><U+009D> not choosing to stay away from her youngest children complying to her eldest sons wishes the changes theyve made in cerseis character also revolve around the idea of motherhood and family making her more sympathetic involves the following  she had unrequited feelings for her husband until a year into their marriage she never aborted a baby but instead had a miscarriagestillbirth she never orders the murder of her husbands bastards etc so apparently dd think the viewers would have more sympathy for a woman whose feelings for her husband are not reciprocated rather than for a woman forced into marrying a man she hates or that a woman who willingly performs an abortion on an unwanted forced pregnancy isnt worthy of sympathy on the whole i find cat and cersei to be the two characters they have tried to make the most sympathetic and it just so happens that these two occupy the mother role in the story albeit on different sides with shae they seem to be going with the â<U+0080><U+009C>whore with a heart of goldâ<U+0080><U+009D> archetype and margaerys portrayal is not really relevant because there is nothing to really compare her to in the books given how little shes present in clash but the whole â<U+0080><U+009C>sympathyâ<U+0080><U+009D> thing isnt my primary gripe with cats portrayal she should be the agent of her own story the one calling the shots on her own life instead she submits to her teenage sons will yes richard madden is 25ish and looks it but robbs still supposed to only be 18 in the books it is her choice to stay at her sons side rather than go home to winterfell and to make that possible she orders rodrik to go back in her place to act as castellan and military advisor catelyn doesnt want to go pay homage to renly but still does it of her own volition because robb offers sending the greatjon as an envoy instead hell during their first reunion robb asks her if shes going to send him back to winterfell like the boy he is but in the show he is ordering her around from the start preventing her from going where she wants sending rodrik to winterfell in her place and making her ride to the stormlands the next day nothing is her choice any more shes become the sidekick to robbs story when it should be the reverse you think that robb ordering her to stay is good because it shows that he values her advice while in my opinion its bad because it strips her of her agency and makes her the passenger of her own life i just find it infinitely more interesting to read about a woman who makes her own decisions even if those decisions arent necessarily the right ones than about a woman who does well in everything because she is constantly told to do by the men in her life book cat is the former show cat is the latter in short i think dd have simply missed the point of the character and her role in the story change in itself doesnt bother me as long as the thematic of a characters arc is kept mostly intact in my opinion thats what they did with catelyn to give an example with another character i find it as bad as if theyd taken out the entire identitycrisis theme out of theons narrative and only played the â<U+0080><U+009C>what a backstabbing douchebagâ<U+0080><U+009D> angle to be clear  i dont think they did that theyve done a perfect job with theon so far imo and finally reverse sexism lol yeah good luck with that argument"
"Currawong",2012-05-15,"the show lost me the moment they tried to make the whore relevantand i mean shaesnipthis show had some great 1 on 1 momentsits just so sad that all of them made no fucking sense in terms of the characters and the emotions they displayed as well as their actionssave for sansa and the queen i would have given the episode a 1you surely cant have watched episode 7 did you actually listen to the dialogue and given more than 5 seconds thought to what you learnt about the various characters seems not i suspect that the reason they are making shae more of a character on the tv show is so that her eventual betrayal of tyrion will have more of an impact dont forget that sansa eventually marries tyrion and having shae as both her handmaid and tryions special whore remember he brought her to kl against tywins orders will mean that viewers understand just why tyrion feels so betrayed to find her in his fathers bed and why he kills her in a rage remember that a lot of what we see of shae in the books is just tyrion pov thoughts as well as just brief glimpses of her grrm provides a great deal of information via pov internalisation and exposition in the books but this does not translate easily to the screen hence we need additional scenes or some characters need to be given slightly greater prominence edited by currawong 15 may 2012  1131 pm"
"wolverine",2012-05-15,"i hated catelyn in the book and though she was a selfish idiot in the show i think she comes off as way more intelligent and capable but whatever with the killing of most of the 13 in qarth it makes me wonder if they are going to try and speed up danys storyline why else would they need xaro to have more power than he does in the books maybe they are just doing it for fun but it makes me wonder about their plans for the future imo there are certainly other threads that could be streamlined from the books particularly from affc"

"Arawni",2012-05-16,"for me i just have to try suspend my cultural bias in order to enjoy it and not get creepedout like you said the way we think of ageappropriateness now is wholly a product of the last century my greatgrandmother was married to my greatgrandfather when she was 12 family lore talks of her waiting for him to go to work to sneak and play with her dolls which is sad by todays standards but marrying young like that was perfectly normal back then you gave daughters to men who could provide for a family not boys actually it wasnt that normal to be married off at 12 during middle ages well it did vary middle ages does cover time period for hundreds of years and average marriage age did not stay the same all the time however there were times when average marriage age was well over 20 years even for women there were many reasons for this for instance at some point church took over marriage deciding it was one of the sacraments and so blessing of a priest was required for a couple to be legally wed this was not free and many poorer people needed years to collect suitable amount of money which meant that they were forced to delay their marriagefor nobles and roayl persons things were of course different they were sometimes married off very young so in that sense grrm is quite correct in his books even though it does creep me out and is one the reasons i dont want to read the books sorry"

"Ghost714",2012-05-16,"well actually one of the reasons for my reluctanse to read these books is the fact that i enjoy the series so much firstly i tend to prefer tvproductions to books it has happened with jane eyre pride  prejudice lord of the rings and with many other books turned to tvseriesmovies which is why i really doubt that i would think asoiaf is better than got and actually stuff that ive read here on this forum has only made me more convinced of this take this catelyns decision to free jaime sure i havent read books but from the debate here i got pretty goot idea about her motivations to do so in book universe however i really prefer her motivations in the show freeing jaime based on a emotional decision while you have no guarantee that lannisters free her children is stupid and whats even more stupid is that she doesnt even have any way to make sure that jaime actually gets to kings landing without being killed on the way which would then result to her daughters deathi much prefer show catelyn at least based on the information here and on other sites ive looked for info about asoiaf and this brings me to my second point i like show characters so much that i dont want to spoil my mental image of them reading the books and being influenced by the same characters there i understand that this might sounds horrendous to people who love these books but thats the way it is this is something people rarely understand in my way and need to consume fiction so i wont dwell on it deeper this is a discussion about the episode 7 after all and not my relationship with the series or booksi havent really taken part to discussion here because im pretty conscious about my english but i do read this forum a lot end enjoy discussions and debates hereyou lost me with  i tend to prefer tvproductions to booksbut what the hell i will bite anywayi either literally cant fathom what your saying or i am calling bs if you actually read the books of asoiaf there is absolutely no way you would say that you like the tv show bettercatelyns character is way better and more competent in the books in the show they took away everything from catelyns character that makes some people love her and others hate her in the books catelyns character is controversial each individual makes their own opinion of her with the show they pretty much tell you how to view catelyn by taking away everything that makes you love her or love to hate her in fact so many characters are like that in the show they have completely changed everything about cersei to make her more sympathetic when in the books most people love to hate her character for what she is jon snows character is way better in book 2 than he is in season two the show has found a way to make him look incompetent in every episode when that was not the case in the a clash of kingsbook two the show actually left out one of the things that made jon snows story so good in book two i am talking about the real reason for why he went ranging with qhorin halfhand in a video with db weiss he is talking about the characters and he says that stannis would make a horrible king in the books that is definitely a debatable subject in fact many readers think stannis would be a great king the show has changed stanniss character into something way more unlikeable instead of leaving his character the way he is in the books and instead of allowing people to make up their own minds about the him the show pretty much tells you how to think and how to feel about him so i guess if your someone who likes being told what to do instead of making your own choices then yes the show is definitely for you if you cant make your own personal assessment about something or someone there are a few examples in the show to wear the show version is better i am not saying the show cant be better at times even grrm has said a few times why didnt i think of doing that however its much easier to improve on something somebody else has made in comparison to having to create something yourself so just because a few of the scenes in the show have been better that does not mean the show is better by any means most of the time the books are way better than the shows changed versionanother reason for why the books are better is because the show cant afford to have all the characters in the books there are so many great characters that wont be able to be in the show strictly because of time and reasons of the budget so by not reading the books you are literally getting the cliff notes of the real story because thats all the time the show has and you are missing out on so many great smaller characters that you will never know if the show cuts a character that does not mean that the character is not needed it just means they do not have the time and money to add them in the showfor the record i did not list all of the characters that the show has screwed up from the books i just named a few examplesjon snow stannis catelyn i dont know if you just dont like to read or what but thats what it seems like that is the only reason that i can think of for why someone would try to say that shows are better than the book versions if you actually read all of the asoiaf books and after tried to say the show was better while giving reasons for why you think that then i might be able to try and understand your opinion but until then you do not have much of an argument at all without having actually read the books of a song of ice and fire"
"StannisandDaeny",2012-05-16,"this conversation is going nowherei agree at least you gave up on saying the screenwriters were sexist well then again maybe not you take offense from aryas line a lot of girls are dumb while earlier asha said anything with a cock is easy to fool these are just the characters not stuff screenwriters want to put in there to be meanhodorand now for something completely different ive managed to make sense of shaes protection of sansa helping her flip over the mattress and stuff isnt that extreme and reasonably someone who isnt cerseis spy would help her mistress with something she could get away in putting a knife to a handmaidens neck then again of course is but selfpreservation may play a role in this the handmaiden could also have told shae was helping sansa hide it and that wouldnt have been good for shae so possibly shes not just acting on sansas behalf that doesnt mean i think it was a good idea all things considered but it might make more sense to me now that the hound was suddenly in the room still doesnt make that much sense to me however edited by stannisanddaeny 16 may 2012  1107 am"

"bardgal",2012-05-16,"actually it wasnt that normal to be married off at 12 during middle ages well it did vary middle ages does cover time period for hundreds of years and average marriage age did not stay the same all the time however there were times when average marriage age was well over 20 years even for women there were many reasons for this for instance at some point church took over marriage deciding it was one of the sacraments and so blessing of a priest was required for a couple to be legally wed this was not free and many poorer people needed years to collect suitable amount of money which meant that they were forced to delay their marriagefor nobles and roayl persons things were of course different they were sometimes married off very young so in that sense grrm is quite correct in his books even though it does creep me out and is one the reasons i dont want to read the books sorryaccording to the text juliet dies just short of her 14th birthday and her mother lady capulet says to herwell think of marriage now younger than youhere in verona ladies of esteemare made already mothers by my counti was your mother much upon these yearsthat you are now a maidso she had juliet likely just after her 13th birthday"
"bardgal",2012-05-16,"well actually one of the reasons for my reluctanse to read these books is the fact that i enjoy the series so much firstly i tend to prefer tvproductions to books it has happened with jane eyre pride  prejudice lord of the rings and with many other books turned to tvseriesmovies which is why i really doubt that i would think asoiaf is better than got and actually stuff that ive read here on this forum has only made me more convinced of this take this catelyns decision to free jaime sure i havent read books but from the debate here i got pretty goot idea about her motivations to do so in book universe however i really prefer her motivations in the show freeing jaime based on a emotional decision while you have no guarantee that lannisters free her children is stupid and whats even more stupid is that she doesnt even have any way to make sure that jaime actually gets to kings landing without being killed on the way which would then result to her daughters deathi much prefer show catelyn at least based on the information here and on other sites ive looked for info about asoiaf and this brings me to my second point i like show characters so much that i dont want to spoil my mental image of them reading the books and being influenced by the same characters there i understand that this might sounds horrendous to people who love these books but thats the way it is this is something people rarely understand in my way and need to consume fiction so i wont dwell on it deeper this is a discussion about the episode 7 after all and not my relationship with the series or booksi havent really taken part to discussion here because im pretty conscious about my english but i do read this forum a lot end enjoy discussions and debates herei have no idea what your first language is but your english is awesome your sentence structure is better than 70 of the population of native speakersi totally know what youre talking about and i too feel that way about many novels vs filmstv anna karenina comes to mind along with lotr just couldnt finish them and love the films i am so excited about the hobbit coming out with pj at the helm i can barely contain myself i hadnt even heard of the books until i finished watching last season and was so in that i couldnt wait an entire year to find out what happens im now on book 4i agree with you i like a lot of the show characters much better than the book probably because i saw the show first im also very familiar with screenwriting and the difficulty in adapting novels to film that i understand and so far have no problems with any of the changes i too like show catelyn better but im glad i also know book catelyni can only speak for myself but i see the books as icing on my giant asoiaf cake and quite enjoy seeing how ddgrrm are working their way through the adaptation the books are fascinating and for me has only made my show experience better edited by bardgal 17 may 2012  1220 am"

"Currawong",2012-05-16,"i dont remember that part of season one at all when did that happen right before they squared off outside littlefingers whorehouse secondly i did listen to what jaime was saying knowing all along that he was going to try to escape im not sure i buy that it was all from the heart and that it gave us some insight into his character he only starts sprouting that stuff once alton tells him that he squired for him and that it was the best day of his life i think he told him what he wanted to hear to serve his own purpose jaime even in chains is all about jaime the jamie we come to know who starts becoming introspective and really thinking about what his legacy will be only starts appearing when he loses his hand and his life goes to crap i think at this point all he is interested in is being great and killing peoplethe scene with jaime and ned is at the start of episode 3 in series 1 where ned arrives in kl and enters the throne room jaime is sitting on the steps near the throne waiting for him yes its a tv special scene but its excellent as for the jaime  alton conversation you say you listened to it but i dont think you heard what was being said one of the things about jaime both in the books and the show is that he is often extremely truthful when being flippant sarcastic or seemingly just casual there was quite a bit of real jaime in that conversation edited by currawong 16 may 2012  0504 pm"

"Ghost714",2012-05-16,"this is unfair booksnobbery ive read all the books and i am finding that i am liking the portrayals of all the characters on the show better even the way the plot is progressing is fine by me someone does not have to read the entire suite of books to likedislike the show and have a valid opinion the show is its own entitiy i think as one who has read and loved all the books that the books have slightly poisoned my viewing of the show now i understand the hatred for the show because it does not follow the books word for word now as season 1 followed book 1 we now have the unfair expectation that season 2  book 2 season 3  book 3 etcfuggetaboutit that is not going to happen and cant happen the books offer muliple parallel stories in the same time line grrm repeatedly warns us in each of the books after got that this is going on theres no way to make the story unfold on tv like that and include everything without getting bogged down in minutia that being said its very possible that since time and the stories are getting stretched out and rearranged there are more chances to put more of the book content on screen since hbo seems to be content with keeping the show on the air for a long time i shudder to think what will happen if hbo gets cold feet and destroys the show like they did deadwood after 3 seasons the horrora great part of me is excited to find out the new story being written in our beloved universe on the tv screen it was the tv show that sucked me into reading the books in the first place which was a stretch for me because i too prefer watching to reading the same happened to me with the lord of the rings movies another great example of an adaptation that had to make some pretty serious comprimises in order to get the story onscreen i wish they had 20 hours to tell the lord of the rings story instead of the 9 to 10 hours of all the movies maybe we would have seen bombadil lets set aside our snobbery and see what unfolds as i would rather have the show than nothing at allnot one person that i have seen is freaking out about the changes that are understandable changes for reasons of time and budget are fine same goes for changes that must be made do to the fact that we cant hear the characters thoughts stuff like that those changes are fine not one person is complaining about that its all the ridiculous changes that dont make any sense those are the ones people dont agree with when they are changing things just for the sake of being different thats what people get mad about its the little things really that doesnt make sense for example in the books qhorin has four men that go with him into the skirling pass counting jon the show also has four men go with qhorin including jon so if they kept the same amount of men why change the names of two of the characters in the books its qhorin jon stonesnake ebben and squire dalbridge yet in the show they changed the names of ebben and squire dalbridge its not a huge change but why do it in the first season they showed jon developing as a character they showed him getting over himself and they showed him growing up yet now in season two its like they forgot about all that great character development with jon by making him say things like i fought and killed a wight how many rangers can say that in an attempt to persuade mormont to let him go with qhorin jon would never say that especially to jeor mormont his lord commander and especially not infront of other officers so when they make jon look like an idiot like that not only are they not staying true to the book but they are also contradicting their own character development that they gave jon in season one in every episode so far that had jon in it they found a way to make jon look extremely incompetent and there really isnt a reason for it other than just for the sake of change by making jon give some dumb ass reason for why he wants to go with qhorin not only are they changing how jon goes with qhorin but they are also destroying great back story for why qhorin chose jon like in the bookanother thing people dont agree with and thats the fact that the show has changed entire personalities and motives of characters they have made some characters more likable and some less likeable for some characters it is a coin toss half the fans like them and the other half hates them yet the show is changing some of these characters and by doing that they are basically saying that the audience should or should not like that character db weiss has said stannis would be a bad king and that is just his personal opinion which is fine people can have there own opinions however weisss opinion of stannis is showing in the character on the show because they made stannis way more unlikeable than the books and i have a big problem with that it should be up to the viewers to deside how they feel about a character the writers personal opinion should not be obvious in the adaptation because there is no evidence in the books saying stannis would be a horrible king there is some evidence that he would be a good king and other evidence that he might not be also when grrm agreed to let them do the show they made it seem like they would stick to the books as best as possible especially because that was grrms wishfor them to stick to the books as best as possible and i believe that for the most part they did that in season one yet in season two they have made a score of pointless changes just for the sake of change the changes i am talking about have nothing to do with the budget and nothing to do with time restriction etc when you make an adaptation you should stick to the source material when ever its possible if you dont want to stick to the source material then why make an adaptation if you cant stick to the source material then you should make your own story you dont half ass copy someone elses story especially when grrm feels that same exact way about adaptations for the record i am not against every change i love the changes with margaery tyrells character i think they were well done and it is synergetic to combine margaerys character with the character of olenna tyrell i really like scenes with arya and tywin i believe they are very well done and the two actors are absolutely great together i am not sure yet how i feel about the changes with jeyne talisa westerling i have to give that more time i really like the dialogue between jon and ygritte last episode rose leslie is doing a great job i just wish they would have gone about those scenes differently for how they got to the dialogue it made no sense for jon to spare ygritte and then chase after her it made no sense for jon to be lost unable to find qhorin after only running at most 45 hundred meters it made no sense that qhorin this badass ranger could not track and find jon also the change with arya and yoren was fineso not all change is bad its just the change that is pointless that makes people mad they should not be changing things just for the sake of change alone and when they do make changes they need to be well done they have taken out alot of really really good scenes from the books only to add in some pointless made up scene for the showif you have read all the books and if you claim to love the books i have a really hard time believing that you could like the show more if you love this story it makes no sense that you would like the show more the books give you just way more they give you more characters more of the world and just more of the story so for anybody to love the story the books are going to be better automatically because they give you way more of what you love how could you love the story in the books and then proffer the cliff notes version not to mention all the changes that arent accurate to the books in the show it just makes no sense to claim to love something and then proffer the shorter version thats like saying you love a person but you would proffer to only be with them for 10 years opposed to 50 how could the shorter more mainstream version be proffered the show has tried to make the story appeal more to the average person when the books are more controversial and stuff and thats why the books are so good you either love them like crazy or they are not for you so i dont get the whole i love the books and i have read all of them but i like the show better stuff like for real have you really read all of them or what because if you have there is no contest very rarely is a showmovie better than the books and with asoiaf being such pure gold its impossible for the show to be better even if the show was as accurate as possible it still would not be better because no matter what they would not be able to include everything from the books they cant include every character things have to be on a smaller scale etc etc it just not possible with these books"

"TeamDanyArya",2012-05-17,"well said i also read jon snow as a very naive boy who doesnt seem to understand how the world around him works i actually didnt like his story much at all during the second book just as i didnt like sansas but in the third book they start to figure out their places in the world and i liked their characters more and more as they became more confident in their surroundings some people say they didnt like ygritte in the books but i thought she was instrumental in helping jon realize his own identity i think the tv adaptation has been very good so far for jon they will still have qhorins sacrifice because otherwise they wouldnt have casted his charactervery true when i read the books i was on the fence about jon until qhorin told him to join the wildings he became a lot more interesting in the books thereafter because he actually started learning about life and shaking some of the romantic notions he had been brought up with he started growing up just like sansa slowly starts to grow up and yes his relationship with ygritte was instrumental in that to a degree it was nice seeing him just kind of happy if that makes sense because jon can come off as rather surly and grumpy and way too serious ygritte is a good foil for that and show ygritte is awesome"
"keelhaul",2012-05-18,"i have to say i really liked the scenes between jon and ygritte first because it gave a good characterisation of what jon is at this point he is an adolescent boy who just simply doesnt know anything about how the world works and he doesnt know that he doesnt know typical adolescent attitude he doesnt come through as someone incompetent that was quite obvious from season 1 he does come through as someone extremely inexperienced that is what he is at this point the tv jon is a likeable character its pretty obvious that he is a very nice guy he is talented and goodnatured he also has a solid foundation to build upon its also pretty obvious that he is very insecure just like an adolescent boy should be and thats it there is a ton of potential in jon event at the end of adwd and it will be a pretty easy job to develop his character id say everything is set up for jon to develop second i loved how ygritte pounded on jons insecurities it was pretty obvious that ygritte really sees something in jon and its also obvious that she keeps her options open by taunting him yes it wasnt highbrow but hell she is a wildling why should she be jons insecurity is so obvious that you dont need to be subtle to confuse him third the tv viewers learnt a lot from their debates although it seems that even most wildlings do not know what the wall is for which is very strange fourth rose leslie is just absolutely amazing she transformed ygritte for me i found ygritte a bit brutish for my liking in the books the tv ygritte is so much more witty i didnt want to want it and fiery in a nongrotesque way"

"Fengari",2012-05-20,"i really like how in the book qhorin and jon dont get caught because of incompetence they did everything they could do to get away from rattleshirt and his party it just was not enoughto be honest in the books that says nothing about jons competence its qhorin and the experienced rangers that get them that far jon is just tagging along the only thing jon has going for him in that sequence in the book is his warging into ghost they obviously chose to cut that which i can understand because in the books so far that was a one time thing and only served to show us something we will be seeing anyway when jon joins mances army it looks like the show has cut all the stark kids warging except for the one where it will actually play a part in the plotlinesi think this is showing jon out of his element jon has been raised as a fighterlordtactician not as a rangerguard i think all of the damage jons character is taking now will quickly be erased when we see him fight qh defend the wall against the raider attack and then ultimately when we see him defend the wall against the wildling army jon was raised to be a leader among men the old bear saw that thats why he didnt make him a ranger and was trying to groom him for commandthats because at this stage in his development he is weak he is not incomptent as some seemed convinced of but is rather ignorant hence the line you know nothing jon snow he knows nothing but winterfell and really is out of his element north of the wall he knows little about life in general other than what ned has taught him and is naiveboth quotes make a good analysis i feel and i want to add this the scenes with ygritte are used to show how honourbound jon is in the books we get the whole ygritte trying to seduce him after he has turned his cloak and we know he doesnt go for it immediately because hes still trying to remain true to his vows through his thoughts even when he finally gives in hes conflicted about it they cant give us his thoughts to tell us why he doesnt sleep with her first chance he gets and he can hardly tell ygritte he doesnt want to betray his vow to the nw after he has turned his cloak so they had to move that part up in order to be able to show us that his vows mean more to him that a piece of kissed by fire tail im guessing his romance with ygritte will take of much sooner after he joins the wildlings in the seriesthe dialogue about free life north of the wall and his face suggesting that it does sound appealing to him add to this what is stopping him from giving in to ygritte and having the free life she suggests he can have is the fact that he has taken a vow edited by fengari 20 may 2012  0545 am"
"Batman",2012-06-07,"yeah i dont want or need them to change her death in the series to it being jons arrow that did it keep that as is and i dont think they are drastically changing their relationship dynamic too much at this point shes kind of bratty in the books which i loved and made no secret that she liked him so her dialogue isnt that much of a stretch for me i can see how a free wilding woman would question the institution of the nights watch and some of their vows its pretty sad that someone as young as jon choose to confine himself is such a way and choose not to love a woman in his life and for what to protect the realm from things north of the wall that may or may not be as evil as everyone has been led to believefor honor it may not be rational or reasoned but its what makes him more like ned than any of his trueborn children"

"Gendels Children",2013-04-14,"i liked ygritte in the books and i really like her in the show they have made her very funny i especially liked when she threatened to tell qhorin that jon had sex with her the words she used were fantastic however i am a little confused by her actions when she kept trying to get with jon i thought she really wanted to do him but later it seemed like she was just doing all that to trick jon into a false sense of security that way she could walk him into a trap so was it all an act or did she really want to bumpuglies with jon or was it a bit of both i think it was a mixture of both wanting him and trying to trick him notice the point she comes on her strongest to try and get jon to sleep with her happens just as they are making their way into the trap i think she was thinking this is my last chance before they capture him or something like that"
"Gendels Children",2013-04-14,"yeah jon this season is so dumb and everyone owns him that its too much even for me and ive never liked him in the books bashing him has been one of my favourite activities on this board really dont see how theyll sell to the viewers him being chosen for lord commander when they spent a whole season making him look completely incompetent and the butt of all jokes in his plotlineive been worrying over thing myself its going to make the whole lc thing seem to come from nowhere i mean i like the show and i think kit is a cutie though for jon i always imagined shorter hair but they write jon like he is an idiot and it hurt the nerd inside me"
"strifed169",2012-05-14,"i honestly didnt like the scene were he murdered his own cousin i thought it was out of character for him because i got the impression he held himself at high standard in terms of loyalty to histhe family and whats this going to do for his character later on in the series word will surely be spread from the north and in affc he is travelling westeros and crosses paths with alot of his relatives how are they going to see him now that hes slain his own blood and isnt it just as bad if not worse than being a kingslayer"

"Eddard Sand",2012-05-14,"so far the kinslaying taboo hasnt been introduced in the show so im guessing it is not going to be a big deal for him he is a member of the family thus the offshoot alton has done him good service"
"Cardinal Sin",2012-05-14,"i also agree this was a bit unnecessary jaime could have just told his cousin to play dead or he could have beaten him up without actually killing him both would have done the trick"
"Laohu",2012-05-14,"he has managed to live down the notoriety of being a kingslayer so i do not think tacking on kinslaying to his list of achievements is going to affect him much"
"Stanmore",2012-05-14,"well there is that part in adwd where selmy talks about how much aerys was in love with tywins wife theres a slim chance jaime was a kinslayer all along"
"Eggplant Wizard",2012-05-14,"yeah i dont think it was necessary either it was still a great scene and i still enjoyed it but i think jaime has been a bit gimped i know it wasnt really avoidable but they should show his fighting prowess more often to make it more impactful when he loses his hand"
"jarl the climber",2012-05-14,"this fellow was a very distant relative i dont think kinslaying applies to 4th cousins or whatever he was supposed to be but what do i know"
"tfoxx22",2012-05-14,"maybe this scene was to help show how ruthless and egoistic he is now so that after he loses his hand it looks like a more dramatic turn around for him just a thought but since we wont get to be inside his head and see how he changes after losing his hand they might contrast this event with him saving someones life or something in the show"
"dtones520",2012-05-14,"i think personally kinslaying refers to your immediate family"

"Independent George",2012-05-15,"i dont like nitpicking every minor deviation from the books but as i mentioned in the other thread this is completely at odds with jaimes character for all the horrible things hes done none of them were truly selfinterested even brans fall was done for cerseis benefit rather than his own and to do it right after he is reminded what it feels like to be admired when the whole world was still open to him this doesnt make his change more surprising it makes it more unbelievable the self loathing and longing for respect has to always be inside him  it cant just come from nowhere killing a boy who idolizes him for his own benefit breaks that"

"imladolen",2012-05-15,"i found jaimes killing of alton to be completely in character yes it was cold blooded and coldly logical and yes it makes him a kinslayer but you have to look at the bigger picturefirst as we all know it is the first duty of any prisoner especially a pow during a war to escape aside from those knights and nobles given their parole and swear to not escape but those people arent going to be penned in squalor but in conditions befitting their rank this supercedes just about everything especially when you consider that the prisoner is one of the armys commanders the brother of the queen mum a member of the kingsgaurd and the uncle well father really of the king jaime lannister is much much more important than little old alton lannister even alton kind of referenced this when he mentions how his father feared alton would embarass the family in front of the family the welfare safety and freedom of the children of lord lannister supercedes all other minor family members at least in this sort of feudal setting not to mention the fact that jaime is one of the greatest warriors on his side of the war his value is worth sacrificing the life of a distant relative and alton was completely sincere when he said he would do anything to help jaime escape sorry but if you are an enlisted man or lower ranked officer and you are imprisoned with one of your armys most important officers and your death will help your commander to escape it really is your duty to die in this situationim not saying jaime enjoyed killing alton i think it did pain him inside just as it pained him to push bran out that window just as it pained him to violate his oath when he killed mad king aerys but as he explained to cat you have to weigh one oath against another weigh one wrong against another allowing aerys ii to live and most likely burn all of kings landing to the ground and killing thousands of the weak and innocent he had sworn to protect was a worse violation than killing the king the wrong of pushing bran out the window paled when you compare it to the death sentence that would be meeted out to him his sister cersei and the three children they had together if bran had told anyone what he had witnessed what is the life of one child you are not even related to and dont even really know when you compare it to the life of the woman you love and your own three children the wrong of killing a distant member of the lannister family paled in comparison to the wrongs that could be done to his family and kingdom as a whole from his pov if he remained a prisoner yes he might have an inflated sense of importance as to his role in winning the war but remember despite being almost universally called the kingslayer he is still regarded throughout westeros as one of the greatest warriors alive his skills in combat and likely in command would be invaluable to maintaining his houses prominance and maintaining joffrey on the throne if his family lost the war what the hell do you think would happen to joffrey myrcella tommen and cersei they would all be killed as would most likely his brother and father im sorry i am a mostly nonviolent person and i dont think i could sleep well for years if i ever took a life even accidentally but if i had three children by a woman and all four of their lives as well as mine could be saved by me killing someone elses 10 year old son id do it in a heartbeat and i think most parents on here would do the same yes it would be an emotionally painful thing something i would hate doing but it boils down to the life of my children and their mother or that boys life unless something is serioulsy wired wrong inside you your childrens wellbeing should override just about everything elsejaime simply had to escape he had no other option and he had already thought through every possible way of escaping and he saw none unless he could somehow lure his guard inside the stockade and there was no reasonable way to lure the guard in without doing something completley shocking and baffling something the guard wouldnt really be able to believe until he saw it up closeand that is exactly what the killing of alton did the karstark boy heard something going on couldnt really see what it was but probably thought it looked like exactly what it was jaime beating his own cousin but that couldnt be the guard must have thought that would just be impossible so the guard came in foolishly yes by himself to investigate what the hell really happened distracting himself from jaime to pay attention to this shuddering body laying on the ground giving jaime the opening to act and to escapeone of the ongoing themes in the books for jaime lannister as i see it is that to do the right thing sometimes you have to do the wrong thing that old the ends justify the means and the good of the many outweighs the good of the few dilemnas in jaimes case it was escaping justifies killing a distant cousin no matter how much you sympathize with and understand his hero worship of you and the good of the kingdom and the lannister family outweighed the good of one minor member of the lannister family to jaimes point of view keeping joffrey on the throne means the lannisters are in charge of the kingdom and to him that is a good thing remember at this point jaime hasnt really seen how nasty joffrey has become yes he knows the boy was foolish and had ned stark executed but he hasnt seen joffreys complete decent into aerys iilike madness yetjaime truly loves his sister at this point still and loves his secret children by her and loves his brother tyrion as well as his father though i would say he is a bit intimidated by tywin as well yes it might be arrogant of him to believe that his escape would ensure their side winning the war hell the books kind of back him up on this as he pretty much brings an end to the war of five kings himself later on which brings the suffering of even the smallfolk to an end at least for now but when you are a man like jaime you have every reason to believe you really will make a difference in the warif you are warrior and thus someone already willing to kill and possible die for your sides cause then yes you will kill whom you have to to ensure your side winswhat jaime did no matter how repulsive it may be to us was done out of loyalty and love a sacrifice that was necessary for his king and familynext thing i know yall are gonna damn jaime for killing aerys ii targaryen the mad king it was the right thing to do as obi wan kenobi said â<U+0080><U+009C>from a certain point of view yet it was the wrong thing to do from a different point of viewits all shades of grey folks and all depends on your point of viewjaime simply did what he had to do whether he liked what he was doing or not he was practical and he was logical and it worked at least for a while"

"Prince of Dragonstone",2012-05-15,"1 it gave jaime something dramatic to do and reintroduces him to the the viewers in a fantastic way the audience hasnt seen him in many episodes 2 the scene was well written and acted both actors were great and i didnt see it coming until alton kept creeping closer to jaime 3 it only serves to enhance jaimes upcoming redemption arc in seasons 3 and 4 4 it adds more sense of immediacy to the karstark subplot now the audience understands who rickard karstark is and why he is so adamant on having jaime dead"
"Eddard Sand",2012-05-15,"i for one really enjoyed the discontent that was portrayed amongst the northmen you really get the feeling that something could go down at any minute the pressure on cat to do something drastic to protect jaime and thus her daughters is palpable making her decision to free jaimie believable once again another example of how visual media can flesh out some of the less believable parts of the book her decision enraged me in the books but is more acceptable this way"
"Castel",2012-05-15,"taking far to many liberties this season and they are not capturing the grey areas of most of the charactershonestly this far too many grey areas are being written out cat letting go of the kingslayer with direct word from tyrion although thats a subtle one ygritte escaping instead of jon just being an idiot and now this i dont even see the point of this what did jaime achieve i mean it seemed to be done purely to make him more eviland honestly im not sure i buy a redemption arc they should be making the lannisters more likeable to make sure they dont take a massive hit aftercertain events instead cersei is neutered and jaime kills someone for the heck of it you can only push the audience so far once they hate these people too much to want to watch them trying to switch it about will seem like a bait and switch especially since of all the evil shit the lannisters have done this was just silly and purely to make the character seem evildangerous i go with evil because a better way of showing him being dangerous would be to show him kicking ass while still chainedthat said the scene was wonderfully acted i love the mention of different branches of the lannister family and how the family was held in such esteem alton was painfully earnest and so was jaime i loved it edited by castel 15 may 2012  0119 am"

"WinterWarrior",2012-05-15,"i didnt like this scene at all because alton who i believe is supposed to be cleos frey is such a likeable young man i always envisioned cleos frey as an old stuffy thing because that is the way roy dotrice reads him in the audiobooks so after than when i read the books that is still how i saw him alton is young and honest i had a hard time watching this scene when i watched the espisode a second time and switched channels until i knew it was over but i get that they have to establish jamie early on as an ahole and then show his transformation the question is who will take his hand"

"way2gimpy",2012-05-15,"so he is alton lannister a distant cousin  but jaime kept talking about altons mother as a lannister so he wouldnt be lannister unless altons father was one too so that would make him a double lannister cousin i dont think there has been any mention of kinslaying being any more egregious than a normal killing as of yet but they could still bring it up i know the conversation between renly and stannis was there but there was no specific mention about kinslaying"

"insertname",2012-05-15,"its already been established that jon will get his orderssee episode 10 description the reeds merely havent been cast for season 2 they will meet up eventually danys story has been an improvement quarth itself hasnt been that important so it doesnt matter if they deviate from the books and the current story is more interesting than what happens in the books imo as for jaimeif killing alton was the only way and there was a sensible chance at escaping then i would be okay with this however it was obvious that he would get caught and he could just have beaten alton bloody instead of killing him jaime doesnt blink an eye at killing but hes neither really cruel nor stupid out of character imo"
"imladolen",2012-05-15,"i stand by what i wrote on another jaime thread from this episodes forumthe scene did not erase any gray areas as people mention above it only reinforces iteta corrected spelling above and also want to point out that the post below is what i posted on the other thread so you can read it here without having to go over there i found jaimes killing of alton to be completely in character yes it was cold blooded and coldly logical and yes it makes him a kinslayer but you have to look at the bigger picturefirst as we all know it is the first duty of any prisoner especially a pow during a war to escape aside from those knights and nobles given their parole and swear to not escape but those people arent going to be penned in squalor but in conditions befitting their rank this supercedes just about everything especially when you consider that the prisoner is one of the armys commanders the brother of the queen mum a member of the kingsgaurd and the uncle well father really of the king jaime lannister is much much more important than little old alton lannister even alton kind of referenced this when he mentions how his father feared alton would embarass the family in front of the family the welfare safety and freedom of the children of lord lannister supercedes all other minor family members at least in this sort of feudal setting not to mention the fact that jaime is one of the greatest warriors on his side of the war his value is worth sacrificing the life of a distant relative and alton was completely sincere when he said he would do anything to help jaime escape sorry but if you are an enlisted man or lower ranked officer and you are imprisoned with one of your armys most important officers and your death will help your commander to escape it really is your duty to die in this situationim not saying jaime enjoyed killing alton i think it did pain him inside just as it pained him to push bran out that window just as it pained him to violate his oath when he killed mad king aerys but as he explained to cat you have to weigh one oath against another weigh one wrong against another allowing aerys ii to live and most likely burn all of kings landing to the ground and killing thousands of the weak and innocent he had sworn to protect was a worse violation than killing the king the wrong of pushing bran out the window paled when you compare it to the death sentence that would be meeted out to him his sister cersei and the three children they had together if bran had told anyone what he had witnessed what is the life of one child you are not even related to and dont even really know when you compare it to the life of the woman you love and your own three children the wrong of killing a distant member of the lannister family paled in comparison to the wrongs that could be done to his family and kingdom as a whole from his pov if he remained a prisoner yes he might have an inflated sense of importance as to his role in winning the war but remember despite being almost universally called the kingslayer he is still regarded throughout westeros as one of the greatest warriors alive his skills in combat and likely in command would be invaluable to maintaining his houses prominance and maintaining joffrey on the throne if his family lost the war what the hell do you think would happen to joffrey myrcella tommen and cersei they would all be killed as would most likely his brother and father im sorry i am a mostly nonviolent person and i dont think i could sleep well for years if i ever took a life even accidentally but if i had three children by a woman and all four of their lives as well as mine could be saved by me killing someone elses 10 year old son id do it in a heartbeat and i think most parents on here would do the same yes it would be an emotionally painful thing something i would hate doing but it boils down to the life of my children and their mother or that boys life unless something is serioulsy wired wrong inside you your childrens wellbeing should override just about everything elsejaime simply had to escape he had no other option and he had already thought through every possible way of escaping and he saw none unless he could somehow lure his guard inside the stockade and there was no reasonable way to lure the guard in without doing something completley shocking and baffling something the guard wouldnt really be able to believe until he saw it up closeand that is exactly what the killing of alton did the karstark boy heard something going on couldnt really see what it was but probably thought it looked like exactly what it was jaime beating his own cousin but that couldnt be the guard must have thought that would just be impossible so the guard came in foolishly yes by himself to investigate what the hell really happened distracting himself from jaime to pay attention to this shuddering body laying on the ground giving jaime the opening to act and to escapeone of the ongoing themes in the books for jaime lannister as i see it is that to do the right thing sometimes you have to do the wrong thing that old the ends justify the means and the good of the many outweighs the good of the few dilemnas in jaimes case it was escaping justifies killing a distant cousin no matter how much you sympathize with and understand his hero worship of you and the good of the kingdom and the lannister family outweighed the good of one minor member of the lannister family to jaimes point of view keeping joffrey on the throne means the lannisters are in charge of the kingdom and to him that is a good thing remember at this point jaime hasnt really seen how nasty joffrey has become yes he knows the boy was foolish and had ned stark executed but he hasnt seen joffreys complete decent into aerys iilike madness yetjaime truly loves his sister at this point still and loves his secret children by her and loves his brother tyrion as well as his father though i would say he is a bit intimidated by tywin as well yes it might be arrogant of him to believe that his escape would ensure their side winning the war hell the books kind of back him up on this as he pretty much brings an end to the war of five kings himself later on which brings the suffering of even the smallfolk to an end at least for now but when you are a man like jaime you have every reason to believe you really will make a difference in the warif you are warrior and thus someone already willing to kill and possible die for your sides cause then yes you will kill whom you have to to ensure your side winswhat jaime did no matter how repulsive it may be to us was done out of loyalty and love a sacrifice that was necessary for his king and familynext thing i know yall are gonna damn jaime for killing aerys ii targaryen the mad king it was the right thing to do as obi wan kenobi said â<U+0080><U+009C>from a certain point of view yet it was the wrong thing to do from a different point of viewits all shades of grey folks and all depends on your point of viewjaime simply did what he had to do whether he liked what he was doing or not he was practical and he was logical and it worked at least for a while edited by imlad 15 may 2012  0154 pm"

"Iotun",2012-05-16,"i generally dont complain and dont mind the changes at all even welcome them i think in many ways the show is surpassing the book but i disliked this move a lot  not just because it moves jaime away from the character of the books and makes his redemption more difficult to accept but also because it moves jaime away from the character of the show as hes been introduced up to now firstly do i think that jaime is above kinslaying in either book or show no tyrion in the books is pretty confident that jaime will kill lancel when he returns and tyrion as we know is a pretty good judge of character he makes the same threat to lancel in the show and it must be a believable one given that its succesful at intimidating him the problem is not that jaime is above killing family members but in the way that he killed him not just the book but the show also has introduced jaime as a man who is ruthless and does not mind killing his enemies but that at the same time he is a man who doesnt play games and has his own personal sense of honour in that when he kills somebody he wants it to be a clean death in a facetoface battle this is a man who by his own admission and as his father successfully judges in the show hates the fact that he is being called a kinglsayer for stabbing the mad king in the back this is a man who knocks out own of his men for stabbing ned stark in the foot and preventing it from being a clean fight this is the man who by his own admission doesnt want to be part of the game whom his sister admits to never taking it seriously this is the man who when catelyn confronts him about what happened to bran comes out and straight tells her that he pushed him off a window because he wanted him to die yes he pushes bran off to his death but that is an act of the moment because he has to protect the other defining feature of his character  ie his love for cercei if we allow ourselves to go to the book jaime when managing to get a sword is more than willing to fight brienne with the intend to kill but refuses to kill her sneakily with his oar while she is swimming in the river i would not mind if he killed his cousin in a scene where say he is escaping and his cousin terrified stands in his way pulls a sword out and tells him cousin this is madness but what jaime does is emotionally manipulate his cousin play a game with him lead him to trust him and then kills him sneakily in an underhanded completely unfair and dishonorable way that is not something that the character the show introduced would do in this regard the show is inconsistent with itself not just the book what makes it even worse is that theres a thousand different ways that an escape attempt could have been thought of and a thousand different ways for jaime to kill his cousin in a more clean way if that was desirable but the show went with the method that was the most dishonorable apparently for shock value and without much concern for internal consistency"
"Iotun",2012-05-16,"doesnt mean he would have killed her they did fight if i recall doesnt sound like him not trying to kill her because he started his redemption arc to methe intent of the scene in the book is pretty clear that jaime has the option to kill her but chooses not to do do so not because of some weird technical reason like he is malnurished it would be very bad writing for martin to make a point of pointing out in that scene that jaime sees the opportunity and chooses not to act unless he wanted to make a point about jaimes character but the way i read it isnt that jaime has started his redemption  but that its a defining aspect of his character that he only enjoys and accepts battle when its face to face and clean he is willing to fight brienne with the intend to kill when he gets a sword and she can defend herself against him but is unwilling to kill her in an underhanded manner this is after all a man who despises being hated for killing the mad king in the backmy own opinion on the whole scene is in the post above"
"SerMixalot",2012-05-16,"doesnt mean he would have killed her they did fight if i recall doesnt sound like him not trying to kill her because he started his redemption arc to mei think that killing brienne in the river would have been infinitely easier that kiling cleo to escape from the enemy camp but there is a reason that jamie didnt kill brienne and it has nothing to do with being malnourished presumably the same would be said for his situatin in the cage"

"Terilien",2012-05-16,"the problem is that this move compromises our freedom of interpretation something that makes jaime such a rich character if you listen to the inside the episode segment david benioff said they had him kill alton because jaimes true personality is that of a monster thats taking something that was very open to interpretation for readers and making it way way too definite they went with one of many many possible interpretations and are running with it while his sociopathy may be crystal clear to them its something i havent quite worked out from his actions the worst part of it is was it too much for him to fake altons death really wasnt that an obvious option id also like to add that yes jaime being a complete sociopath does conflict with the books a sociopath doesnt go away inside because of aerys targaryens atrocities nor does he feel guilt because he cant protect aerys wife from rape edited by terilien 16 may 2012  0909 pm"

"icspotz",2012-05-17,"clearly jaime is irredeemable after tossing bran but imo it was unnecessary to resort to kinslaying to further establish his amorality especially with the emphasis on kinslaying being worse than kingslaying and familial ties being so important in this culture martin is at the height of his craft in presenting conflicted characters motivated by their background and personal experience what separates grrms from that of other writers of the genre is the finely nuanced characters who are not defined as purely good or evil but share both components it is more difficult to show the opposite side of jamie as he begins to transition emotionally post amputation by having him yet again commit a heinous crime taking him further away from the character the author meant to portray this somewhat damages his future dynamic with brienne and cersi as he begins to regret his actions which i hope is not altered by the hbo series in contrast the added scene of joffery and the prostitutes showing him as an utter psychopath is more in tune with his character"

"Somnus",2012-05-19,"actually i loved this scene it seemed like something jaime would do after all hed do anything to go back to his dear cersei and its pretty obvious alton isnt a lannister from casterly rock he spent the minutes before complaining how his father didnt want him to squire jaime because hed ashame their branch of the family or how they had to seat very far from the main family during the feast i think its pretty obvious that hes from lannisport so jaime killing alton to me is kinslaying as much as what robb does to rickard karstark"

"salt",2012-05-19,"also as far as this being too dark for jaime lets remember that its only luck that kept him from going too far before his redemption arc of course there is bran only being paralyzed instead of being killed but remember that on the kingsroad he was out searching for arya and would have cut her hand off if he had found her first he was going to chop off a little girls hand because his sister demanded it of him while he was fucking her if he wasnt a monster he was pretty damn close"
"K.C.",2012-05-19,"do you happen to remember how much jamie cared about cleos in the booksthis is what i kept thinking when i read the posts about it being somehow out of character yes alton was a lannister by blood rather than marriage but they did their best to establish that hes from a different branch so distantly related that jaime doesnt even know who his parents areany talk about it making him somehow less redeemable should stop at the part where he shoves a little boy out a window by the way i thought the briennejaime lines they gave to cat worked just as well having him bring up neds bastard was a nice touch"
"ThePrinceOfSunspear",2012-05-19,"if they share the same last namethey are kin hence jaime in the tv show is a kinslayer as for book jaime yes he was a monster he did terrible things and he would done even more terrible things if he had the chance too such as mauling arya for what she and nymeria had done to joffrey however jaime isnt just a monster by the end of asos he becomes a deeper more complex character because of his storyline with brienne and by the end of it all you feel for jaime even if its just a sliver of pity and understanding its there for most of us the problem with hbo and this ridiculous scene is that its going to make it that much more difficult to feel anything for jaime later on of all the characters on the canvas i believe jaime has the best chance of redemption he robbed bran of his legs and his glorious dreams of being a knight in return jaime lost his hand and essentially his identity and self worth im not saying their even but jaime has suffered and will continue to suffer in my opinion as myrcella and tommen pay for the sins of their father and mother"

"Shoemaker",2012-10-07,"i generally dont complain and dont mind the changes at all even welcome them i think in many ways the show is surpassing the book but i disliked this move a lot  not just because it moves jaime away from the character of the books and makes his redemption more difficult to accept but also because it moves jaime away from the character of the show as hes been introduced up to nowfirstly do i think that jaime is above kinslaying in either book or show no tyrion in the books is pretty confident that jaime will kill lancel when he returns and tyrion as we know is a pretty good judge of character he makes the same threat to lancel in the show and it must be a believable one given that its succesful at intimidating himthe problem is not that jaime is above killing family members but in the way that he killed him not just the book but the show also has introduced jaime as a man who is ruthless and does not mind killing his enemies but that at the same time he is a man who doesnt play games and has his own personal sense of honour in that when he kills somebody he wants it to be a clean death in a facetoface battle this is a man who by his own admission and as his father successfully judges in the show hates the fact that he is being called a kinglsayer for stabbing the mad king in the back this is a man who knocks out own of his men for stabbing ned stark in the foot and preventing it from being a clean fight this is the man who by his own admission doesnt want to be part of the game whom his sister admits to never taking it seriously this is the man who when catelyn confronts him about what happened to bran comes out and straight tells her that he pushed him off a window because he wanted him to die yes he pushes bran off to his death but that is an act of the moment because he has to protect the other defining feature of his character  ie his love for cerceiif we allow ourselves to go to the book jaime when managing to get a sword is more than willing to fight brienne with the intend to kill but refuses to kill her sneakily with his oar while she is swimming in the riveri would not mind if he killed his cousin in a scene where say he is escaping and his cousin terrified stands in his way pulls a sword out and tells him cousin this is madness but what jaime does is emotionally manipulate his cousin play a game with him lead him to trust him and then kills him sneakily in an underhanded completely unfair and dishonorable way that is not something that the character the show introduced would do in this regard the show is inconsistent with itself not just the book what makes it even worse is that theres a thousand different ways that an escape attempt could have been thought of and a thousand different ways for jaime to kill his cousin in a more clean way if that was desirable but the show went with the method that was the most dishonorable apparently for shock value and without much concern for internal consistencyi kind of agree with you especially that altons death was bit out of character for jaime and his very own moral code of clean deaths it is odd that he could dispense a clean death but not his cousin you cant might say this illustrates how truly desperatereduced he was at the time  and i think he must have been on an all time low but it was a really good scene and i really liked it  just not the ramifications for jaimes character"

"Mista C",2012-05-14,"i liked the jamie scene up until the murderescape here is my problem with it the kingslayer is the most valuable prisoner in the stark camp and he is even in his own stockade which is being constantly monitored by several guards jamie starts violently smashing in the head of his cousin just minutes before a guard walked by and told them to shut up because they were talking too loudly but no one comes over or sees jamie bashing in his cousins head then once the guard does open the door to the stockade hes by himself not with several other guards because this is the kingslayer but completely alone jamie then strangles him and again not one other guard walks by while he is doing this there probably are guards whose only job it is is to sit and look at that stockade but none of them are around at this point once he is strangled jamie then needs to find a key to unlock his shackles with him being such a valuable prisoner the key for his individual shackles would probably have been kept on the other side of the camp but of course the guard that came in to investigate has the key on him then once jamie is done taking his shackles off he has to escape the camp let me repeat that he has to escape the camp that is roaming with 15000 north men his stockade was not at the edge of camp near the woods it was probably right smack in the middle of the camp itself youre telling me that he just snuck through the camp around tents and not one single north man noticed him and said holy shit its the kingslayer poor poor storytelling in my opinion i was somewhat ok with it last night while i watched it but today now that ive had a chance to think about it it stinks edited by mista c 14 may 2012  0255 pm"
"Lord Ravenfrost",2012-05-14,"i agree with most of whats being said on the thread here that being said a couple of points i think are being blown out of proportion firstly well start with the mountain i think they found the best replacement possible with whatever resources they have the body type needed to make the mountain close to what he was in the book is virtually impossible to find in the real world unless you get a professional wrestler to play him being a tall person myself i have to say that being tall and built like a brick shit house doesnt happen normally genetically tall people are not predisposed to being very thick with muscles people like the mountain just dont exist in the real world in any kind of abundance secondly i see people wondering where stannis is when the writers eliminated storms end as a setting they cut out any filler for his story it makes perfect sense for him to be gone when hes been written out what would they do as a replacement show him and davos sharing counsel making battle plans idk im glad they havent forced any unnecessary stannis scenes on us and im perfectly fine with just seeing him suddenly appearing at the blackwater with his army jons story is being completely screwed over and its making me sort of angry heres how i think its gonna go down from here jon will be marched off to see mance and at some point the half hand will be caught too while those two are being held the half hand will tell jon he will have to kill him soon and go over to the free folk jon will protest and want to die along side his brothers and the half hand will tell him how important it is to find out what mance is doing and how he will need to learn as much as he can before he returns to his brothers while this still works in the end i think its really stupid i really hated what theyve done to danys story as well she comes off as this stupid girl who is prone to temper tantrums i never got that from her character in the books theyve made her too proud imo and its gonna be hard for folks to respect her later on when she really starts to show who she is as a person idk maybe it will be alright im looking forward to her meeting ser barriston later and next season when she acquires her army in astapor i actually did like xaro and pree taking control of qarth it will make more sense to nonbook people when xaro shows up in meereen to try and convince dany to leave then when she doesnt hell declare war on behalf of qarth ive enjoyed harrenhall a lot but if they dont have tywin leave soon im gonna freak out also would it kill them to maybe mention more info about the brotherhood without banners like maybe whos the leader and idk maybe how many times hes been killed beric shouldnt be glossed over like he is and theyve done so at every opportunity why he was in the first season and now hes not even mentioned and it isnt like it wouldve cost any money to fit him into the dialog i really wonder what the writers are thinking at times i also think they shouldve had jaime escape with alton rather than kill him it looks like now it will be just brienne and him which i guess works but i liked cleosalton as comic relief i think the things the writers have done with jaime otherwise is pretty awesomeim looking forward to him hurling insults at brienne all next season i think brans story may still work out even though nobody thinks they are dead i think they will still emerge from the crypts and find a dying luwin and perhaps the reeds will show up as theyre leaving the castle who knowsi find it difficult to believe that bran will just prophetically dream he has to go beyond the wall but i wouldnt put it past the writers to take even more shortcuts with the story theon has been brilliant in every scene this season nothing to bitch about here tyrion has been awesome too and bronn is just as i had him pictured in the books they are making cersie too damn soft too soon she doesnt start acting this soft until shes broken by the faith and then paraded naked through kings landing i can see why the writers would want to humanize her but they are way jumping the gun here she doesnt even become a pov untill the fourth book cant she just be an evil bitch until then"
"Jayaris",2012-05-14,"in terms of qarths security  pyat was probably around for a long time before dragons came about with considerably less magic a chamber with no guards and personal weaponry allowed is probably a safe setup bar a guy that can split off into a dozen people and slit everyones throat which the thirteen have no reason to believe he is actually capable of for the escape scene  if jamie brings him with him he is now slowing him down if jamie allows him to escape on his own he is more likely to be captured trying to exit the camp than jamie is notifying the camp of jamies escape if jamie leaves him alive and he is awake he will probably be killed if jamie knocks him out he might not be killed presumably the jailor actually saw the beating given his response time  if jamie beats him too little the guard reacts differently or he doesnt come in at all if he beats him within an inch of his life hes liable to die suffering over the course of the next few days thats why i dont have a problem with the decision itself because there are a lot of things to consider and killing alton is the cleanest strategy in terms of escaping so you might say that killing him was unnecessary but it increased his odds of escape overall the only thing i thought was strange was the five second pause after he said he needed to die i was almost expecting him to say just joking oh man i got you but maybe he used that time to decide that killing him was in fact the best option the tywinarya relationship was a bit contrived i can see why he might want arya to eat though if she was planning to or already had poisoned his food her reaction might give it away or she might reconsider the option altogether my biggest problem with this episode was the winterfell storyline as i understood it they set the false trail and came back to winterfell in cover of night i dont see anyway that they can end up back at winterfell and get in the crypts with no one noticing during the daytime the bodies didnt particularly look real they were totally dehumanized and as others had said nobody believed it was bran or rickon now that i think of it the whole idea is questionable at least the freys sewed robbs head onto his wolf why does anyone not question the absence of the two wolves in the murder of the children"

have been more obvoious about what was going on and no one ive spoken to or heard from taht didnt read the books thinks they are deadi also think they have lost all steam with the battle of blackwater it will just appear in episode 9 without the buildup i think it deservedfwiw  my friend who hasnt read the books turned to me at the end of the episode with a look of horror and said are they really dead to which i responded do you really want to know he hadnt even noticed the two kids at the farm so yeah  there are going to be plenty of people who think what theyre supposed to think at this point that theon really would kill the stark boysas for the buildup to blackwater  i think well get a ton of that next week i hope so anyway and some talk about the chaini might be the only person who is fine with all the changes so far remember the books are all written from different povs of certain characters inout of their head so a lot of action happens offstage and is only described in exposition by other people whereas we are getting to see some of those events in the show robb and lying lady talisa there is also the difficulty of playing a characters internal mentalemotional narrative that somehow needs to be put into live action instead of happening inside their head because you just cant shoot that thats why a lot of the things that are being changed are being changed the way they are im not bothered with the changes so far because i think theyre going to work themselves out in the long run ones that come to mind  twyin  arya next week ep 8 roose bolton could show up at harrenhall weve seen a preview of tywin rushing out to kings landing to help with the blackwater i dont have a problem with he and arya conversing because it reinforces just how smart arya is which is paramount shes already killed three people  jaqen helped with two and is about to kill another to escape harrenhall it gives tywin a lot more dimension than hes given in the books which will make what happens later a lot better of course he speaks to her  shes the only other person at harrenhall with a functioning brainstem i did love the my lord vs milord from tywin only to be cleverly schooled by wicked smart arya with the my mother taught me how to talk proper which is the lowborn way to say it followed immediately by properly oh snap im sorry who is smarter than tywin lannister yeah that would be arya stark  jon  ygritte i was worried until she got away from him last night theres no reason that they havent also caught qhorin while we were watching ygritte bait jon establishing their relationship now gives a lot more credence to what happens between them later otherwise it might not be very plausible when she comes to his defense when her life isnt at stake it also helps establish just how inexperienced jon is with women and how different free folk females are from their southofthewall counterparts ghosts absence i dont have a problem with this he goes missing all the time in the books and thats what theyre establishing hes a direwolf not a pet ghost chooses to be with jon as do all the other living stark direwolves nymeria shadows arya i do wish theyd do more of this in the series but theres plenty of time jamie  alton alton says something to the effect of being a distant lannister by taking that into consideration with the rest of his tale he is of low birth and that means not a real lannister i have no problem with jamie killing him were already seeing the beginning of his arch with this scene and everything he says to alton then his speech to cat about all the conflicting oaths and he saved the seven kingdoms when he killed aerys but no one can see that so his bitterness is justified jamie doesnt know the future he doesnt think hell get caught so his plan at the time is sound he also knows hes running out of time  hes in a pen not a secure dungeon like the book that could be breached by some drunken idiot with a burning desire to kill him at any moment there must be bowmen in robbs army why wouldnt he do everything in his power to escape to not do so would be totally out of character having this scene also gives cat more reason to let him go otherwise hes going to get ripped up by the camp before robb returns and poof there goes her best way of getting her daughters back going forward cleos really was just dead weight in the briennejamie story line which is why grrm kills him off in the books jamie confessing in front of cat  brienne he did in the books so im not understanding why people have a problem with this just because hes not drunk in the dungeons of riverrun while doing so matters little in the long run cat letting jamie go really has more to do with getting arya and sansa back so her getting the news of bran  rickon after releasing him gives her even more justification for her actions i dont see cat cutting off jamies hand because that would mean jamie and brienne cant have their mutual asskicking scene later on when theyre taken by the brave companions thats a huge point for jamies character development about how he sees brienne i cant see how they skip that having brienne escort jamie alone reinforces just what a baddass she is  tyrion  cersei in the books tyrion knows and cersei knows he knows to play otherwise in the series would be to dumbdown one of these characters and be a gross disservice and insulting giving them that scene does three things 1 it gives cersei a biggerbetter arch by making her more three dimensional than just being onenote evil i think its important to differentiate between the joffrey degree of evil and her they are two different people 2 it gave tyrion that magic moment of wanting needing and instinctually going to comfort her and discovering where the invisible caution  do not cross yellow tape was in the book he touches her she recoils and we know his hurt because that chapter is through his eyes we dont have that internal luxury on film 3 it gives more buildup to just how insane and evil joffrey is and that everyone with a functioning brainstem knows it dany theyre giving her a lot more to do than they did in cok stealing the dragons gives another note to give me what i need right now that is danys only objective in cok which is too repetitive and onenote for the tv series theyre also setting up the house of the undying and a justifiable reason for dragon woopass  robb  lying lady talisa in the book robbs marriage comes as a shock this way we see why and we get to see more robb that is winwin for the shows ability to tell the narrative vs the books  bran rickon  the reeds ill bet were not going to see bran  rickon again until the last episode so many nonbook peeps will believe theyre dead with everyone getting raven scrolls about theon killing them to reinforce this and this season will end with the four of them exiting the crypts of winterfell minus the reeds just like the book next season they can meet up with the reeds because they need to separate bran and rickon somehow and need someone other than hodor to look out for bran this way they give osha more screen time before she disappears with rickon and the overall narrative stays the samethings i am missing that i think are needed at some point the reeds  can wait for next season ser dontos for all the sansa escape stuff  but there really is plenty of time for this since its very repetitive in the books and could wait until next season the cache of dragonglass at the fist  since jon has already gone north they can wait for this until next season really especially since its more the slayers story than jons weasel  how are they going to do weasel soup ill miss that if it doesnt happen but they could get the same outcome with other eventsthere are three main scenes i thought when i read the book that they had to have this season and would spend  on the riot which was only missing horses  which is fine and impossible to film without hurting someone with horses in that space the house of the undying she has reinforced this with her claim this season of my dreams come true the battle of the blackwater  just hope they dont skip tyrions chaini still have faith"

"congokong",2012-05-14,"nitpicking is getting difficult as you said as this show is becoming unrecognizable the only scene that was strongly reflective of the books although shorter was sansa and sandors chat but even that was awkward with her asking why he was so cruel when theyve barely spoken before onscreen the writers suck to put it bluntly theyve taken golden writing thrown it away and wrote poor replacement material all three jonygrite scenes were about sex yawn none of their dialogue was from the books if i can recall the writers should be fired after getting a pat on the back for a good first season they starting thinking they could do a better job and just changed everything cersei is too sympathetic and shae all she shares with bookshae is her name and that she has sex with tyrion they are completely different characters why would tyrion put up with a whore who threatened to gouge out his eyes and whines all the time"

"Natmus",2012-05-15,"one more general nitpick is the lack of freys in the storyline in the books freys are mentioned in all areas of conflict with robb in the west helping edmure defending the riverlands and they are also part of the stark forces at harrenhal in the books there are no doubt that they are a significant part of robbs forces that is why in the books we are in no doubt that the loss of the frey is so serious in the show they have hardly been mentioned and the short sequence at the twins in the first season is long forgotten by most viewers by now so i am unsure about how the show will convey the repurcussions of robb marrying nursegirl and how to get things moving towards the rw unless they will hurridly introduce a lot of new characters and families in season 3 to me it seems like they are underplaying the longterm storyline for instead focusing solely on the shortterm items which i think will make season 3 too disconnected to the current season"

"Raksha the Demon",2012-05-15,"agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree good job youve nailed every problem there is with the way theyre portraying charactersi fully enjoyed this episode i found the theon scenes awesome peter youve got some competition cause alfie is fantastic quarth didnt really bother me though dany is getting bossier and louder thus more annoying who would have thought that possible but while entertainmentwise this episode was great i cant fail to think that theyre changing the characterswhy are they so intent on making cersei the good guy and with jaime killing his cousin so coldly its going to be hard to move on with his redemption nonreaders linger on first impressions and after this scene i think theyll hate jaime even more and i am annoyed because he ought to be liked because hes awesomeon a more positive tone sansas flowering was nice theons story is moving ahead brilliantly iain glenn is so handsome hes actually made me a danyjorah shipper actress playing ygritte is really good though all that talk about sex and bones and naked girls was too long there are no actual sex scenes and theyre trying to replace them by talking about them for more than 5 minutes when we havent see stannis in 5 episodesactually id rather have five minutes of sexual banter during the jon  ygritte northern comedy hour than five minutes of sexposition or sex or nekkid roz it was rather amusing at least more amusing than watching roz cavort with a friend while littlefinger reveals his innermost motivationsi dont recognize this cersei tvcersei is a numbed subdued mostly declawed lioness who were supposed to pity just a sad struggling mother please i did like the scene between them because the actors made it work well but thats not the real cersei and even tvcersei seems to have forgot that last episode she was making chilly threats against tyrion because he sent myrcella away i even liked danyinqarth or maybe i was distracted by the glorious cheekbones of iain glen but i thought dany was less shrill than usual and believable in her dialogue with jorah especially when she gives him a scary bloodofthedragon look and tells him to find her dragons she should have her dragons snatched more often the episode showed just how totally out of her league dany is at the moment lording it over a ragtag remnant of a khalasar is not the same as impressing anyone in a city as old and sophisticated as is qarth at least while her dragons are so young alfie allens done a great job this seasona doubledirewolf sighting  three seconds of summer and shaggydog trotting after their boys and yet another rozfree episode hooray"

stems from my annoyance that they refuse to introduce the audience to riverrun alreadytyrioncersei  sansashae new bffs this show has grown a habit of presenting completely different ideas right after another in one scene we have cersei wishing utter pain for her little brother and hoping that she is the one who gets to dispense it and then in the very next scene they share they are some how sitting around drinking wine and chitchatting about things like theyve been friends since day 1 now mind you had this scene taken place after jaimes escaperelease like it was supposed to it would make sense because then she believes jaime might be dead and is emotional and distraught in this scene she was just drinking shae and sansa went from being complete strangers with justified levels of mistrust to confidants and partners in crime all without the need of pesky dialogue or visuals to get in the waybranrickon bodies a bit too obvious but im going to cut the show some slack here because winterfell has been the closest this show gets to the book possiblegregor clegane worst casting ever he seems as menacing as robert from everybody loves raymond in fact that actor may have done a better jobim kiddingjonygrette i didnt like it im hoping it gets better but i think itll get worse before it gets bettervarys where the fuck is this guytywin lannister worlds most entertaining lord tywin does not smile he does not laugh and he doesnt offer his food to servants unless he believes it may be poisonedthings im on the fence abouttywinarya at this point im convinced that tywin knows something is up which is why the scenes with these two arent making me that upset because he seems to be subtly probing for more informationoffering her his food can be seen as him wanting to see if she had table manners and he is clearly interested in her past and is not buying her lies where that becomes a problem for me is when he starts giving her advice on how to continue her charade properly but im hoping that whatever the writers have planned here it works out because i would hate for the end of tywin and aryas time together come about but the issue of her identity isnt brought up at allstolen dragons so from what i can get from this story is they wanted to make xxd look like a worse person and they needed to add some sort of excitement to danys story before she gets to the house of the undying or risk people losing interest in her story both are understandable but they better play out to actually be interesting instead of just being what i suspect and that they are just ways to overhype dany going to the hotuthings i liked the karstarks well casted well playedjaimecat scene great both actors nailed this scene perfectly i think it would have been better if cat had known about the boys because the amped up emotions would have worked beautifully in this scene but other than that it was greatygrette 1the actress is doing a good job of portraying the role 2 she finally said you know nothing jon snowcerseisansa scene this to me was one of the few times that the show seemed to understand the feel of the book i thought cersei was great in that scene she was cold yet slightly warm informative yet misleading the way she so calmly told sansa what little she had to look forward to in life made me believe that well see the nutcase cersei soon to come and sansa was great because she looked exactly as uncomfortable and scared as she was described in the booksyes shae and sansa are becoming bffs next thing you know theyll be going to bard concerts together and have picnics with margaery when she comes to kl and gossiping about lions and hounds or whatever i keep thinking that shae is going to be furious when sansa marries tyrion and shell have more motivation for turning on both of them in her testimony at tyrions trial tywin lannister has really got too much time on his hands if he can spend precious moments chitchatting with a cupbearer he doesnt even know her name but has her tasting his food and is investigating her education and speech patterns is he going to open up a tywin lannister harrenhall girls leadership academy with his mysterious cupbearer as head girl i really dont mind the tywinarya scenes too much because its a lot of fun to see them bouncing their considerable talent off each other its not every young actress who can hold her own in a scene with charles dance nugregor shocked the heck out of me because he was actually goodlooking i didnt recognize who he was supposed to be until tywin called him by name whoah an attractive mountain who speaks rather than growls my continuity hackles are bristlingobviously the viewers have forgotten that jaime chucked a kid out the window in season 1 the writers had to make him murder his cousin to remind us that he is evil wonder if this jaime will eventually turn on brienne he seems to be more of a sociopath than bookjaime who is not redeemed yet in my eyes but

"Le Cygne",2012-05-17,"i think it was out of character for them to make up a scene with jaime killing a lannister of all the needless character changes in the show that one bothers me the most jaimes story jons story and aryas story were the ones i most wanted to see now jon is wandering around without a clue and is letting a wildling call the shots arya is not interacting with jaqen i guess mice feet in the bathhouse and weasel soup are out in inside the episode david benioff called jaime a monster and a beast we knew he wasnt a great guy but a monster and a beast the king aerys committed horrific atrocities including cooking neds father in his own armor and raping and beating the queen and jaime found all of this very hard to watch something they showed in season 1 finally he forced jaimes hand by ordering him to kill his own father tywin the incident with neds men was in response to catelyn capturing and about to kill tyrion for something he didnt do and back then he was also still trying to prove himself worthy to tywin something they showed in season 1 he pushed bran out the window because cersei would have been beheaded for treason the children too and it was cersei who had insisted that he have nothing to do with them at any rate they were lannisters so theres a pattern here tyrion tywin cersei lannisters when their lives are in danger jaime lashes out we know what jaime was thinking at the time of this episode because the first jaime chapter in asos took place the next day and it turns out he had been thinking about the above things for a long time jaime does a lot of things that day and the next and this is before he loses his sword hand that are in stark contrast to the way he behaved with alton on the show so lets go over the events of the next day and the next couple of days this gives us a lot of insight into the time hes spent as a prisoner too we find that he often thinks brash thoughts but then does the opposite thats a clear pattern he talks a good game when it comes to being tough but when it comes down to it what does he actually do he reflects that he regrets pushing bran out the window and when cersei said what if he tells and wanted him to finish him off what he actually did was say well just say hes lying then he reflects that he wants to send the girls back to catelyn so theyll see that he kept faith he is briennes captive and thinks he will kill her to escape and yet he doesnt kill her and unlike alton she isnt a lannister in fact jaime helps brienne someone he doesnt even know someone who refuses to let him out of his chains again and again when she is about to be picked off by the archers on the cliff he creates a diversion when she tries to gets back into the boat he could have killed her but instead he helps her get back in when they are attacked again he yells down to protect her and his book cousin cleos speaking of cleos jaime didnt particularly like him but he was a lannister throughout this and the prior books we knew the lannister family name meant a lot to him so then he rides over to join brienne instead of riding away he offers to take the arrows she had been hit with out for her when they are caught wrestling in the mud he thinks up a story covering for both of them when the bloody mummers are threatening to rape her he thinks up the sapphires story so they wont do it he wants brienne to call him jaime not kingslayer repeatedly we see people calling him kingslayer really bothers him and he wants this woman who values honor to call him jaime we see that while hes been in prison hes been reflecting on his past deeds so that takes us to one day after he supposedly was in a state of mind to kill alton a lannister someone who was on his side someone who wanted to help him and this is all before jaimes hand was cut off then his hand is cut off hes in severe pain and hes still going out of his way to be nice to brienne even though he blames her for not letting him out of his handcuffs he keeps trying to help her hes acting the same way as before his hand was cut off so theyre talking about raping her again he tells her to go away inside because thats what he did when he couldnt stand hearing the queen getting raped and beaten by the king aerys and all the other atrocities the king committed to protect brienne he yells sapphires he gets kicked in the stump for it and passes out and again we see he doesnt want to be called kingslayer but jaime he explains his actions to brienne trying to convince her he was justified the same thing he did with ned last season then he is free and headed back home but he comes back to rescue brienne even though he is unarmed and only has one hand he jumps into a bear pit to defend her so here we are at a few days after the scene we saw in this episode he helped her before his hand was cut off and he helped her after shes not a lannister he was her prisoner for the most part then later she was a fellow prisoner and he was in severe pain then later he was free and she wasnt it didnt matter this is not the man we saw in a man without honor also in the book he was unarmed and killed armed guards of the opposing army then grabbed a sword and killed some more the book escape attempt was initiated by tyrion the brother he loves it was a good plan he had several armed men on his side in the war to help him break out this was the the impetus not jaime killing a lannister to save his own skin and for no reason he could have played dead in what has been pointed out was not a good plan also the redemption plot was carefully crafted to address what he did to the starks saving the stark girls which was also briennes mission but now hes a kinslayer edited by le cygne 18 may 2012  0731 am"

"seikai",2012-05-17,"just watched this episodeam i the only one that was disappointed with the way they depicted the scene with sansas period i dont really like the way theyre portraying sansa so far its like theyre taking away all the parts that show that she does have spunk i hate using that word but i cant think of any other word that fits first they take away the scene with the hound where she comes out and tells him that ser gregor is no knight  something that i think was a bit of a turning point in their relationship now theyre changing it so that all she does during her flowering is cry and weep and look to shae to do everything during the beginning of this series sansa rarely has moments where she shows she has some fight in her i personally loved this scene in the book where she discovers shes having her period then promptly goes and tries to burn the entire mattress down which ends up almost burning down a big portion of the castle it really shows how alone she is her desperation and it goes to show the extent of how much she dislikes joffrey which helps show an improvement from her previous attitude of liking the horrible brat i also found the entire scene somewhat hilarious in a dark humor sort of way i think it makes for a far more hilarious awkward moment when the maid barges into the room only to see a bloody and half naked sansa pushing her entire mattress into a huge fire she built in her room then sansa having to be restrained by three maids as she desperately tried to burn the thing down i think it also gives more humor to the moment when cersei joked that she heard that sansa was trying to burn the castle down and that she sees that having joffreys kids is not a very appealing idea to her now  it just sounds like such a funny understatement as an aside im getting funny mental images imagining the hound being there while she burns the mattress down i can imagine him looking absolutely terrified while the entire room smells of period blood smoke maybe im just strange to find this funny edited by seikai 17 may 2012  0100 pm"

"NeilSpoon",2012-05-15,"i very much doubt they will include the chain because if they do they will have to visualise ships being caught by the chain and burn etc this seems a big ask considering the budget issues they will just focus on the wildfire i predict a couple of birds eye cgi views of everything being ablaze to create a sense of scale actual battle scenes will be kept to a minimum as well and i think this will be a good thing as it will be limited to a few actors with a couple of extras and most likely no horses to carry out the scene this will look extremely lame and cheap they simply dont have the cash to create epic battle scenes such as in return of the king etc so its better to just suggest the scale and focus on what happens behind the scenes"
"Tourniquet",2012-05-15,"remember grrm wrote the episode blackwater he will be sure to include what he finds is crucial to the plot of his novels if he doesnt think the chain is a big deal and can be replaced with some other device to prove that tyrion saved the day he will do so the show makes plenty of changes but this is one episode that we know grrm has control of he has written for tv before this is his series i am sure that he will make it work"

"Dagmer Cleftballs",2012-05-15,"also the chain wouldnt do much to stop a massive invasion in fact if they keep the ships at bay and force them to land troops farther from the walls the wildfire plan would be less effective anyway its a lot easier for foes to scatter and evade on the ground than when theyre stuck aboard wooden ships"

"Dagmer Cleftballs",2012-05-15,"it matters enough to me that i finally signed up to post a theory on how to make it work whatever they do im sure theyll keep that motivation for tyrion intact going into season two he was clearly a tv audience favorite and pretty much the only lannister people didnt want to see killed obviously in a couple of seasons everyone will love jaime too since then theyve done a lot to humanize tywin and cersei and postblackwater tyrion will grow to hate them more than ever may as well start laying the groundwork for that now"

"Eddard Sand",2012-05-15,"i agree that a quick little map scene would be beneficial and preferable but isnt exactly necessary they can still get across the point that the ships are trapped with some good cinematography cgi birds eye view of the ships flooding the river mouth cut to a scene of the briefly introduced but already forgotten saladhor sahn holding off his own ships we can see the chain being raised and the catapults flinging wildfire down on them something like that could work"

"DirtyRobes",2012-05-16,"hey all long time first time and so forthhow about this the chain is already there as an existing defense mechanism tyrions having the chain forged is not the truly brilliant part rather it is his idea to use the chain to trap the fleet inside the harbor so the wildfire can do its work as stannis fleet approaches joffrey would rather say cersei but everything on tv is joffreys idea so whatever orders the chain raised to slow their attack but tyrion refuses the order joffrey brands tyrion a traitor for this still upset about the postriot scene and orders ser meryn to kill his uncle by the time he gets to him the wildfirechain combo has decimated the fleet but meryn still tries to kill him pod saves the day tywin and the tyrell host rout stannis remaining troops and receive all of the credit basically everything in the book storyline is set right by this change but the chain sequence is a little less telegraphed thoughtsok my only problem with this is then stannis and his whole fleet would have to know about it as well if it was already a part of kls defense system then there is no way stannis would not know about it having lead a lot of roberts armys its very important that the chain is a new defense while yes tyrion did not invent the idea he did spring it on stannis fleet combined with wildfirewhile id take this over no chain we still have davos leading the stupid headlong attack also if thats the case he doesnt notice those little towers off in the distance a nice shot of their demise there are soo many reasons the chain is important not only to tyrions character but to the whole events of the blackwater i dont except that there just wasnt time to insert a very short scenethats all it needs as obvious as tyrion commissioning a blacksmith to make him metal rings or even another character saying the blacksmiths are all backed up with orders from the hand with the big reveal in ep 9im still hopefull but lessps welcomeedited for welcome edited by dirtyrobes 16 may 2012  1153 am"
"Balefont",2012-05-16,"ok my only problem with this is then stannis and his whole fleet would have to know about it as well if it was already a part of kls defense system then there is no way stannis would not know about it having lead a lot of roberts armysyep"
"Impish",2012-05-16,"what the audience needs to see is tyrions cleverness thats what this season shouldve built upvery true and i will certainly be disappointed if there is no mention of how long tyrion has been working on the chain im just saying they can easily cover this with a handful of lines during the actual battle all itd take is bronn saying something like and i thought you were crazy when you put all the blacksmiths on that weeks ago or whatevermuch more economical to do it that way than devoting screen time showing its actual manufacture of course the downside is we lose the whole what the heck is this chain for mystery element from the books or rather the mystery will be compressed into a few minutes between davos noticing the towers and the chain being raisedi cant imagine them not having the chain at all it makes the battle and isnt grrm himself scripting this episode no way hed cut one of the most if not the most crucial elements of the battle"

"ledlevee",2012-05-24,"so does anyone else think tyrions pigshit comment had something to do with how hes ultimately going to save the day its looking more and more like the chain isnt going to be in the show for one reason or another so what in the world could pig turds have to do with anything or am i trying to read too much into that comment it was definitely a joke but it seemed that tyrion was actually thinking about that comment after he said it like he was scheming up a plan or something at least if i remember the scene correctly"
"MikeNH",2012-05-24,"so does anyone else think tyrions pigshit comment had something to do with how hes ultimately going to save the daythe pig shit comment was a reference to bronns discussion about wildfire w the pyromancerit went something like this bronn old men wheeling around jars of pigshit pryo our order does not deal in pigshit edited by mikenh 24 may 2012  1008 am"

"Jamie Lannister",2012-05-14,"what do you think was butchering alton a step too far even for the amoral jaime i mean the kid had just poured his heart out to him saying it was the best day of his life when jaime took him to squire and then crunch and again and again and againi dont know i wouldnt put it past him but still that was brutal he smashed the poor kids head in and they write it off like it doesnt even happen to get back into pseudobook canon mode for the cat and brienne scene eh i found it pretty jarring and assuming theyre going to be trying to make him more sympathetic in s3 that murder will be one hell of a specter how is that not worse than what he did to bran good scene though i wasnt expecting the sheer brutality but still"
"Catastrophe",2012-05-14,"what do you think was butchering alton a step too far even for the amoral jaimeyes he never did anything close to that bad in the books also the fact that he didnt even seem shaken by it makes him seem like a complete sociopath the book jaime was at least capable of feeling guilt"

"Ser Giant",2012-05-14,"it was awful i he had stopped smashing the kids face after blow 2 or 3 it wouldnt have been so bad apparently he is some crazed maniac all of a sudden the only truly terrible decision made this season imo"
"House Snow",2012-05-14,"if jaimie is a kinslayer then so is robb"
"Envie",2012-05-14,"i dont think the act itself was beyond jaimes capability or moral standing considering all of the other things hes done and will do however the brutality felt a little gratuitous to me considering the same thing could have played out if he just knocked the kid out and made some noise to cause the guard to come running in for the same reason if he just wanted an escape going to such brutal extremes wasnt really necessary and felt contrived overall i love jaimes lines in the scene and the exposition was good my guess is they put that in there for shock effect"
"Kittykatknits",2012-05-14,"i am a bit worried about what that scene means for jaime in the future in the same episode tyrion and cersei have a convesation about joff where she states he looks like jaime and talks about the targ madness i am wondering if they are going to paint jaime as a darker more evil character in the show to help explain joff a bit better cersei has been made a milder character so it seems possible they will do the opposite with jaime if this happens and i really hope i am wrong it will be really disappointing jaime is one of my favorite characters and ive been looking forward to his scenes all season"
"Hear Us Roar",2012-05-14,"he threw bran out a window without a moments thought some random distant relative is of no consequence i think his need to escape was more dire on the show in the books his first escape was from a nice room with all the luxuries in the show he is covered in shit and is dragged from camp for months in this new situation he would have totally done it"
"_Oberyn_",2012-05-14,"eta regarding him not feeling guilt or being shaken by it im pretty sure thats how he is in the books too even in the third book when we finally get into his head i dont recall any sort of guilt or remorse developing in until a little over halfway through after he loses his hand and goes through all that crap with brienne in harrenhall he seems like a complete sociopaith because he is one and i think that scene portrayed him very wellnot realy he had a chance to abandonkill brienne when she was in the water after the boat chase"
"Catastrophe",2012-05-14,"you dont think pushing a 7 year old kid out a window is as bad as that thats not a criticism im legitimately curiouswhat he did to jory and neds guards was pretty awful and senseless too although i agree what he did in that scene is even worse im not sold on it being worse than the defenestration of bran thoughno i dont think either of those things were as bad jaime pushed bran out the window because he and his familys lives were at stake if robert had found out the truth he wouldve had jaime and cersei executed and may even have killed their children as well im not saying that what jaime did was right but he at least had a very good reason for what he didas for killing jory and neds guards his own brother had just been kidnapped he was in an uncontrollable rage and the starks were on the verge of war with the lannisters as horrible as it is killing an enemys bannermen seems to be standard westerosi behavior so what he did wasnt even that out of the ordinaryimo neither of these compare to jaime killing alton in cold blood"
"tfoxx22",2012-05-14,"im thinking this scene was just to remind the audience of what jamie is capable of and to what extent he is willing to go to save himself or his immediate family i mean he has been in a cage the whole season"
"WeirwoodTreeHugger",2012-05-14,"is kinslaying ever clearly defined in the books my impression was that it applied to parents children and siblings but not neccesarily cousins this rule is practicality masked as religion i think things would be pretty chaotic if family members were constantly killing each other for the inheiritance"
"Mad Queen",2012-05-14,"im still trying to decide if killing alton was actually worse than jaimes other crimes or we just think so now because its a new thing and we are used to his other crimes in any case it was unnecessary and the way it played out was obviously for shock effect first bond with then kill relative brutally"
"Catastrophe",2012-05-14,"after thinking about it i think i realized what my problems with this scene areits not the kinslaying part that bothers me since alton is a distant relative anyway its the fact that jaime killed someone who was on his side and someone who idolized him at that even it had just been a random lannister soldier with no blood relation to him it wouldve bothered me just as much in the books jaime is utterly devoted to his family and his house almost everything he does is for them in the tv show he seems to only be out for himselfalso i didnt like that jaime committed premeditated murder luring alton in like a serial killer and then showing no remorse afterwards in the books his crimes were always acts of passion i always got the sense that attempting to kill bran was literally jaimes worst action something he did in a spontaneous act of desperation and fear it was him at his lowest same goes for killing jory it was an unthinking act of rage at a time when he feared for his brothers life i didnt think of him as a horrible person i thought of him as a oncenoble man who did a few horrible but not unforgivable things in the show it seems like hes just a murderer through and through and this is just par for the course for himimo this version of jaime never wouldve killed aerys he wouldve gotten on his horse ridden far away from kings landing and watched the fireworks from a distant hilltop before running back to casterly rock edited by catastrophe 14 may 2012  1042 pm"
"Gemini",2012-05-14,"agreed it doesnt bother me at all that it was a relative its the underhanded scheming way he did it that just isnt jaime on top of that jaimes worst crimes have always been committed for the sake of others whether it was bran his sister jory and company his brother or aerys the realm this was utterly selfish and rather pointless and i just dont buy that jaime would do it"
"Stannis Iron Baratheon",2012-05-15,"i think it was done to enphisize his redemption in later seasons and in his deffence i would do the same thing"
"Onion Smuggler",2012-05-15,"i think it was done to enphisize his redemption in later seasons and in his deffence i would do the same thingi think theyll be even less sympathy for him now there can be no redemption for his tv actions reallyi think it was in interesting decision not least because i thought alton was meant to be cleos frey so its just going to be brienne and jamie who escape now its made him seem even more ruthless and sociopathic than he is in the books id be interested to know what non book readers opinions of him are in later seasons"
"SerMixalot",2012-05-15,"i dont buy his motivations he is an extremely valuable prisoner he has to know he is going to be traded back at some point an escape makes that far less likely especially when killing nobles i know he attempts an escape in the book but that escape seems to have at least have had a chance of working he is covered in shit in the middle of a camp of 15k soldiers yes escaping from a castle is different but in some ways easier if you have the element of surprise and mummers faking voices i suppose that is a relatively meaningless difference in the logic of tv world but still edited by sermixalot 15 may 2012  0606 am"
"Bambi",2012-05-15,"the scene really surprised me jaimes brutality was an unneccesary change from the books i think someone mentioned him as sociopath above hbojaime is really gets to look something like that and i dislike it"
"Giskard Reventlov",2012-05-15,"in the books he start his path to redemption after he loses his hand maybe they wanted to emphasize his narcissism and disregard for all others except cersei before s3"
"reiver",2012-05-15,"jaimes redemption worked for me because even though his actions were immoral and against what the code of the era said he should do they were consistent and relatively justifiable but never wanton or cruel this seems a step into a different kind of evil with the prekilling bonding the whole thing felt very cheap and manipulative and i dont see how this character can fit into a the redemption arc theres nothing to be misunderstood here the other thing im less keen on is that now rickards demands for jaimes head are justified before there was the whole unreasonable nature of the demand for something done during battle now it looks like theyre going to skip the need for robb to make a difficult decision edited by reiver 15 may 2012  0906 am"
"ThePrinceOfSunspear",2012-05-15,"the show singlehandedly destroyed jaime lannister as a character"
"Brienne the Beauty",2012-05-15,"killing a distant relative cant be kinslaying since all the nobles are interrelated but this does not seem to put them off warring against each other i thought this change was brilliant in the books cersei was a bit too unsympathetic and jaime too sympathetic the show is playing up cerseis good side and jaimes bad side which is much more interesting and ambiguous"
"SerMixalot",2012-05-15,"there is definitely a distinct difference between attempting to kill bran and killing cleo sic killing bran was to protect the one thing he cares about cersei bran could have destroyed everything he killed cleo sic to escape from prison i just dont buy the motivation considering the bloody cold heartedness of it"
"David Selig",2012-05-15,"i dont think a distant cousin counts as kin when it comes to the kinslaying tabooi dont think killing a distant relative to escape is out of character for jaime from the books at all hes a ruthless and callous manhe killed cleo sic to escape from prison i just dont buy the motivation considering the bloody cold heartedness of itwhy not remember how jamie killed jory and the other two stark men just to send a message to ned he is ruthless and killing is no big deal for him at all he was also out searching for arya at the trident with the intent to kill or maim her edited by david selig 15 may 2012  1148 am"
"Ser Elfor the Landstander",2012-05-15,"i think a lot of people confuse jaime before losing his sword hand with goldenhand jaimegoldenhand is a great character who grew a lot during his asos and affc arc especially in his dealings with brienne their interaction made him a better person for all intents and purposesbut it was losing his hand that really changed him without his natural talent for sword fighting jaime lost his identity  the one defining characteristic that made him objectively better than anyone else he became more humble and started to view things in a different wayjaime before losing his hand was a douchebag he worried a little about his family loved cersei and tyrion but he only cared about himself shoving bran out the window was a pretty horrible thing people may rationalize it using his the things i do for love quote as a sign he did it for cersei but we dont really know what he was thinking at the timein the end it doesnt matter that jaime would do anything for his or his familys safety ignoring everyone in the way at that moment the person in the way was bran in the show it was alton lannisterso i had no problem with this scene it was amazing and it doesnt destroy jaimes character for the future"
"The Monkey",2012-05-15,"maybe it doesnt matter much but i assumed that alton wasnt jaime first cousin but maybe second or third he didnt know who altons mother was and i would have thought he would have kept track of his own aunts but if she was tywins cousin or second cousin that would be another matter plus i dont think alton would separate that much between his family and the lannister family if their parents were siblings its still kinslaying but perhaps a milder form than most people assume edit also people overlook a fact that was revealed in affc when nymeria had mauled joffrey and arya had run away cersei wanted jaime to find her and kill her and jaime stated that he wouldve done so without a second thought if only he had found her first killing arya would have served no purpose whatsoever as neither jaime or his family was in jeopardy if she survived so tell me how killing arya is incharacter for twohanded jaime but killing alton isnt edited by the monkey 15 may 2012  1008 am"
"HouseLark",2012-05-15,"im unconvinced about the distant relative argument kin are kin no matter what the two share a name and allegiance which marks them as something more than bannermen we should also remember that the scene has the impact that it has had precisely because jaime and alton were known to be relatives if alton was just another captive soldier then the audience would have shrugged with indifference at jaime stoving his head in so in one breath do we acknowledge that the scene was forceful for that reason but then in the next deny that its genuine kinslaying if it isnt a kinslaying then the scene is almost meaningless its a throwaway if it is a kinslaying then jaime has committed one of the most grievous acts in the world of westeros where do we go with that im minded to think that jaime is a kinslayer and this will feed into his character development it will be another act that he cannot forget along with his kingslaying it may be another of those things that he broods upon when he returns to the kings guard"

"Gryz the BlackSmith",2012-05-16,"yes the show tells a slightly different story than the books you didnt notice until nowwhat do you think you didnt understand a word of what ive writtenim not complaining that the tvseries is different from the booksits a different medium other ways of telling the same story will work betterwhat i dont like is when some of the base characteristics of the characters are changed if somebody is complaining that tywin smiles once in the tvseries while he never smiles in the books i dont care but if tywin suddenly becomes this friendly dancing singing cheerful character that tells jokes and gives candy to little kids then yes i got a problem with that right now i find the tywin from the series getting more and more different from the books and the story about jaime in the books is that we knew nothing about him in the first book but after that he actually became a much nicer person if the tvseries lets jamie slaughter a few more kids that whole storyline from the books is going to be much less believable"

"zippypoodle",2012-05-16,"yes he never did anything close to that bad in the books also the fact that he didnt even seem shaken by it makes him seem like a complete sociopath the book jaime was at least capable of feeling guiltyes but he really didnt exercise that capability until after the handchop he killed aerys and got spit on for it by people like the eversonoble ned stark at that point he pretty much decided fuck everyone im doing what i want since you hate me anyway so he threw himself into being the best fighter ever and into cersei because she was essentially the female version of himself only after he lost his hand and therefore his reason for existing postaeryskilling was he forced to reevalute he didnt so much fall out of love with cersei as he did fall out of love with himselfwhich meant he no longer wanted the female version of himself"

"Maggie the Cat",2012-05-16,"ive read the books and i seriously couldnt find any redemption in jaime until his journey with brienne i find his actions in this episode completely in keeping with my impression until said time spent with brienne which i believe is actually in asos keep in mind that having read the books through to adwd we now know much more about jaime and his character and motivations but at this point in acok we didnt sometimes its hard to reconcile that"
"Iotun",2012-05-16,"the below is a copy of what i said in the other thread on the exact same subject i generally dont complain and dont mind the changes at all even welcome them i think in many ways the show is surpassing the book but i disliked this move a lot  not just because it moves jaime away from the character of the books and makes his redemption more difficult to accept but also because it moves jaime away from the character of the show as hes been introduced up to now firstly do i think that jaime is above kinslaying in either book or show no tyrion in the books is pretty confident that jaime will kill lancel when he returns and tyrion as we know is a pretty good judge of character he makes the same threat to lancel in the show and it must be a believable one given that its succesful at intimidating him the problem is not that jaime is above killing family members but in the way that he killed him not just the book but the show also has introduced jaime as a man who is ruthless and does not mind killing his enemies but that at the same time he is a man who doesnt play games and has his own personal sense of honour in that when he kills somebody he wants it to be a clean death in a facetoface battle this is a man who by his own admission and as his father successfully judges in the show hates the fact that he is being called a kinglsayer for stabbing the mad king in the back this is a man who knocks out own of his men for stabbing ned stark in the foot and preventing it from being a clean fight this is the man who by his own admission doesnt want to be part of the game whom his sister admits to never taking it seriously this is the man who when catelyn confronts him about what happened to bran comes out and straight tells her that he pushed him off a window because he wanted him to die yes he pushes bran off to his death but that is an act of the moment because he has to protect the other defining feature of his character  ie his love for cercei if we allow ourselves to go to the book jaime when managing to get a sword is more than willing to fight brienne with the intend to kill but refuses to kill her sneakily with his oar while she is swimming in the river i would not mind if he killed his cousin in a scene where say he is escaping and his cousin terrified stands in his way pulls a sword out and tells him cousin this is madness but what jaime does is emotionally manipulate his cousin play a game with him lead him to trust him and then kills him sneakily in an underhanded completely unfair and dishonorable way that is not something that the character the show introduced would do in this regard the show is inconsistent with itself not just the book what makes it even worse is that theres a thousand different ways that an escape attempt could have been thought of and a thousand different ways for jaime to kill his cousin in a more clean way if that was desirable but the show went with the method that was the most dishonorable apparently for shock value and without much concern for internal consistency"
"SerMixalot",2012-05-16,"weird that they would claim cleosic is a distant relative it was established that he is the son of the fat lady lannister and jl makes it clear that is the only fat lannister and the only fat lannister is tywins sister which makes cleo sic jamies cousin certainly not a distant relative esp since fat lanniser lives in the west seemed weird that part of the conversation"
"Colah02",2012-05-16,"if jaime had killed cleos it would be kinslaying but from what i understand alton was more distantly related in which case he is no more a kinslayer than robert was for killing rhaegar imo regarding whether book jaime would of done the same in that situation i think at that point he would of he seemed to slowly change once he had sworn them vows to cat hence why i dont see the situation where he had a chance to kill brienne as comparable"

"Sixshells",2012-05-16,"i think that the way he is described bookjaime has about the emotional maturity of a teenager while being a 30something in age which explains some of his sociopathic tendencies because lets face it teens often exhibit such tendencies before maturing even his bragging about killing the whole world except him and cercei has a childish ring to it trying to kill bran had little to do with protecting cercei and his children its something he did because thats what he thought she wanted not even because he thought it would protect her before his redemption his children are a nonentity to him he doesnt see himself as a father nor does cercei allow him to think himself as that so he doesnt care what would happen to them nor does he think of protecting them when he pushes bran downimo his redemption arc is less about actual redemption than about for him to grow as a person he has to suffer consequences of his actions and harsh situations in affc he has to learn to command and take responsibilities when he has always be under the orders of other people the people he respected are not there anymore the circumstances of the death of the father he feared make him doubt his character the loss of his hand crippling him made him question what he was the loss of cercei as the anchor of his affection he grows fatherly concerns about tommen and the way he is raised etc i dont think he will necessarily come out of this personal journey a much better person but he will probably be more wellrounded or get increasingly cynical but even before that he was not more bad than the next person i would thinkwhich is why i think its out of character for bookjaime to kill alton in cold blood when he could have done differently to escape he could have beaten him up or told him to fake illness and help him overpower the guard i dont see him killing a member of his family even extended so gratuitously and in cold blood because of the way he was raised in other circumstances for example if he were to be between him and the escape in the heat of action sure but not if they can do otherwisei think the only reason the writers killed alton is because they had settled for the good old faking illness way of escaping and they tried to sex it up and make it look less cheesy by having jaime actually kill alton it certainly adds a shock factor but it doesnt make the tactic less clicha and its out of character both for book jaime but also the tv version who is a bit nicer to begin with"

"Sixshells",2012-05-16,"well yes but even good children and teens need to mature to be wellrounded adults and its really not uncommon for adults to to be psychologically unhealthy because they were unable to do that and i think thats the case for jaime my point wasnt that teens turn into budding sociopaths but rather that some traits not uncommon in the young would be associated with antisocial behaviour in adults like egocentrism lack of empathy or responsibility which is normal because children and teens are still in the process of being socialised the fact that jaime shows such a degree of immaturity shows he is indeed psychologicaly imbalanced but the fact that he can begin to work on that and seems able to experience some remorse points to him not being a fullblown psychopath and his condition being more linked to the fact he didnt get the opportunity to develop before i would also question the notion that he is a monster he is not a good person particularly preredemption and even after that but he is no gregor clegane amory lorch vargo hoat or ramsay bolton"
"icspotz",2012-05-17,"clearly jaime is irredeemable after tossing bran but imo it was unnecessary to resort to kinslaying to further establish his amorality especially with the emphasis on kinslaying being worse than kingslaying and familial ties being so important in this culture martin is at the height of his craft in presenting conflicted characters motivated by their background and personal experience what separates grrms from that of other writers of the genre is the finely nuanced characters who are not defined as purely good or evil but share both components it is more difficult to show the opposite side of jamie as he begins to transition emotionally post amputation by having him yet again commit a heinous crime taking him further away from the character the author meant to portray this somewhat damages his future dynamic with brienne and cersi as he begins to regret his actions which i hope is not altered by the hbo series in contrast the added scene of joffery and the prostitutes showing him as an utter psychopath is more in tune with his character"
"imladolen",2012-05-17,"i dont think a distant cousin counts as kin when it comes to the kinslaying taboo i dont think killing a distant relative to escape is out of character for jaime from the books at all hes a ruthless and callous man why not remember how jamie killed jory and the other two stark men just to send a message to ned he is ruthless and killing is no big deal for him at all he was also out searching for arya at the trident with the intent to kill or maim herif jaime killing alton made him a kinslayer then robert baratheon was one too when he killed rhaegar at the tridentrobert and rhaegar were second cousins and it sure seems like that is about as closely related at best that jaime and alton were edited by imlad 17 may 2012  1124 am"

"dtones520",2012-05-15,"i think that tywin knows who arya is and somehow she will find out that he knows which will then prompt the weasel soup scene but it will lead to her escape the way he talks to her makes me think he has to know who she is she has the stark look she is obviously highborn he has to know arya is missing heck i think the fact he made her his cupbearer is because he knew as soon as he saw her he wanted to keep her close and safe without her knowing he was on to her tywin lannister is too clever to be outsmarted by a 13 year old girl or however old she is in the show"
"Rockroi",2012-05-15,"i think that tywins knowledge of who this highborn girl is is open eneded the writers have done such a good job that everything from tywin looking over the blackwater and being told that arya stark has been missing thus leading tywin to piece together exactly who he was speaking to at harrenhal that whole time to tywin looks across the harrenhal courtyard and says to gregor once i have left make sure you take arya stark back to kings landing is all in play nothing would surprise me at this point thats how good the relationship has been done this season"

"jlk7e",2012-05-15,"how loose is arya running around harrenhal no looser than sansa is running around kings landing i think"
"summer_stark",2012-05-15,"i think you have a point monkey  although boojam is right the mountain is leavingleft already to deal wbwb  so that was my thinking for why it was possible  in the sense that very few people will be left at the castle so if the mountain or someone else comes back wnortherners then it could happen and i agree wthe whole jaqen saying it might take awhile and her saying nevermind  i thought of that as well  but still thought it was a bit silly considering that we know that jaqen can move fast  like 30seconds and done  fast granted this is tywin not amory but still seems contrived to make an attempt to say she thought about it but not hard enough to really want it  which in the context of her being his little buddy might make sense except that she clearly thinks about killing nearly every episode granted in the books she thought about it when it was too late but the too late thing here makes less sense either way if that happens and she keeps her 3rd wish for weasel soup i will be psyched and i agree re her killing the guard is a character defining moment and i hope they leave that intact along with the coin  but since they already killed the ticker for her i am worried they might sanitize her  though this would be absurd in the context of who she becomesand i know they let her kill the kid last year so maybe it will be fine i hope youre right monkey  that was essentially how i saw it going down a few episodes ago but it just seems like a lot to fit in so i am starting to lose hope that and the fact that tywin knows shes at least a noble made me worry that that will be the reason she leaves and she uses her 3rd wish for the guard or something totally lame i think they wont be that lame though"

"Forgiven",2012-05-18,"i dont think this tywin thing has gone beyond redemption and i have enjoyed it a lot too the scene with littlefinger once again made littlefinger seem bit too obvious about his interest but nonetheless if we take this as something tywin does for amusement over a puzzle he hasnt quite yet cracked so we get to ep 18 mountain returns with northener prisoners wish there were a scene with robb sending bolton to take harrenhall before then little premonition and news of stannis movement towards kl should make him see the strategic advantage either assure tywin doesnt go to kl as he has northern army approaching or actually take harrenhall if tywin does leave with his army somewhere towards the end of episode tywin leaves with mountain to kl however my major problem here is that who does he leave in command as i dont think we have a goat cast one can hope this isnt true and why doesnt tywin take arya harrenhall is big place if tywin hears of stannis and decides he needs to rush hes not going to worry about a cupbearer no matter how intriguing if she cant be found when needed and jagen can refuse on sorry too busy cant do that right now basis he was pissed off enough after the last time she rushed him then ep1920 soup goes here im not actually quite sure if we get an escape this season they might want to give her some time with bolton too and less travelling around travel is bad on screen so her leaving hh just before jaime arrives shouldnt be a problem edited by forgiven 18 may 2012  0700 am"

"The Flaying Man",2012-05-16,"i thought that they made it a bit too obvious by the obvious references to the two winterfell orphans as well as actually showing them i think the short scene with bran rickon hodor and osha should have been left out it may have been slightly more believable thenalthough i dont know what would have happened with dagmers walnut revelation then regardless somehow my brother who is extremely intelligent for his age was fooled and believes that the burnt scarecrows i mean boys are actually bran and rickon so i suppose it just depends on the viewer in saying all of that however i like to take the series on its merits and i think its doing a fantastic job i also loved that final scene alfie allen was fantastic as always his expression speaks multitudes and the music really added to what he has become"

"Jem",2012-05-16,"thats what burnt bodies actually look like thoughill have to take your word for it because fortunately ive never seen burnt bodies however they looked like they were made from papier mache to me like a pair of pinatas wouldnt bits of them fall off i know one had lost an arm but wouldnt a burnt body fall to bits when strung up"
"turdle",2012-05-16,"none of the nonreaders that i watch with think it was bran and rickon but i also had my doubts when reading the book correct me if im wrong but didnt we learn second hand that they had been killed in the books before going to winterfell and the kids heads are on spikes for me the doubt came because we were learning from an outside source not seeing it first hand but then when it picks back up in winterfell it seemed more convincing because they had heads on spikes and i was like oh i guess they are really dead perhaps they would have been better off following the same structure on the show but i dont really think its that big of a deal if nonreaders arent fooled but i agree that showing them walking toward the farm house was probably a mistake and are we to assume that they are not back in winterfell then that theyre just going to go ahead an start toward the wall"
"arya horsefaceless",2012-05-16,"i thought tv made it pretty obvious it wasnt but when i read the books i felt it was obvious it wasnt them eitherand i dont pick up on clues as well as most"
"Raja",2012-05-16,"to be frank though  i never really bought the deaths of bran and rickon in the book either  but agree that they could have done a much much better job  something to make it personal or to identify bran with  while putting those bodies up would have helped edited by raja 16 may 2012  0829 pm"
"Dragon greyscale",2012-05-16,"hmmm so ill repeat what i said on another board i cannot believe how many people were unconvinced while reading the books i didnt think they were alive during my first and only read it seemed essential to me it was only after the reveal that i got used to and increasingly annoyed by grrms fauxdeaths they were the first fakeouts of the series right and it is a difficult climax to translate to screen i can see that nevertheless i still think they could have improved it by leaving bran and rickon out of the episode entirely they were also offscreen in the books so we move from its just a game to the hanging bodies wait i stand corrected i would use spiked heads instead the bodies were too fake maybe even better they could have shown theon riding into winterfell with two heads in his hand its like the rhakaro death adding some nice visual recurrance or do i sound like a creepy psychopath now"
"Strider",2012-05-16,"put me down as one who never really believed that theon killed bran and rickon i found that part of the book implausible if you find the hob rendering unconvincing and i dont disagree i think the blame needs to put squarely on martin"
"fede989",2012-05-16,"i have just posted this on the discussion topic but i think it might fit better here i loved this episode but i had a problem with the last scene it isnâ<U+0080><U+0099>t that they choose to make it clearer that those two burned bodies were not bran and rickon rather than they cut the scene way too early the sickened face of theon when he looks at the bodies was great the screams of maester luwin were heartbreaking and the score for that scene was incredible pertinent it really wanted to make you feel the same as theon lost confused and absolutely sickened but i canâ<U+0080><U+0099>t help to think that if that scene lasted a little longer it could have an even bigger impact they could have shown the disgusted faces of the people of winterfell for example or more facial expressions from theon realizing what he has done and his internal struggle in that moment i mean murdering two innocents boys is a truly horrible an unredeemable act even if they arenât who they are supposed to be we got to see too little of his reactions for my taste and worst is that alfie allan has shown to be really good at it when the picture faded to black i couldnt help to feel a little disappointed with that scene because of the emotional potential that it had still this was an incredible episode one of the best if not the best of the season for me anybody else felt the same with this scene edited by fede989 16 may 2012  1142 pm"

"victim",2012-05-17,"the acorn thing is weird but not much weirder than what reek uses in the books  in a pouch or something my memory is failing me basically all dagmer and theon are doing is pretending theyve found something really important and then sending maester lewin away so he believes theyve found and will kill the boys"
"Marjie Eilie Myatt",2012-05-17,"i believed it in the books for me it was my first asoiaf fakeout and as someone else mentioned i wasnt scrutinizing the writing at that time but instead was reading quickly for the what happened later during the rw i reread several times to see how the victims were possibly getting out of this one what i dont understand from the episode and i can only watch it this year in clips on youtube is why theon himself seems so shocked or sickened by the corpses was he not part of that whole staged presentation for the folk of the castle he looks like hes seeing them for the first time i dont get it and that presentation was corny if maester luwin comes off as a little bit fake i think its okay because wasnt he faking in the book didnt he know the bodies werent right even though reek had dressed them in stark cloaks and whatnot hes gotta sell it"
"Alboin",2012-05-17,"if the boys and direwolves would part ways direwolves would trick theons hunt to that river and bran and others would stay in the cryptas it is in the book it all would make perfect sense i dont know maybe direwolves cgi is too expensive but they are on screen either way how this walnut thing is better then what was happening in the book is beyond me"
"Jayaris",2012-05-17,"i have read a heard a lot of non readers who were immediately aware of the fact that the hanging bodies were definitely not bran and rickon i have to agree that it did not have the impact i expectedit was too obvious the corpses looked superfake and they were trying too hard to make us think they found bran and rickon walnuts wtf do all walnuts in westeros end up in rickons hands also some people thought the end music was awesome i thought it fell totally flat very anticlimactic it surprises me that this doesnt annoy more people am i crazy i thought the bodies looked pretty fake but after watching the twitter recap on winteriscoming it seemed like a considerable amount of people were fooled"

"SerMixalot",2012-05-17,"i have been critical of the adaption to date however i buy the interpretation presented the link may be weak but it is internally consistent rickon seen eating walnuts earlier and enough to drive the story along hitting all the major points perhaps it could have been done better but i still think it delivers what is needed it will be weird if br go back to the crypt though cause that would be far more dangerous in the tv series trying to sneak back in once the chase is over"

"Rickon is FIERCE",2012-05-19,"its really a very subjective point for myself i also thought they were dead when i read the books happened to ned when i never believed it would why not his boys plus i hadnt read far enough into the series to know that the basic rule is to ignore any claims of deaths that occur offstage the gut reactions ive had to that and scenes like the reveal of tyshas being exactly who tyrion thought she was and not a whore after all or the rw moments when i felt surprised or shocked or sucker punched are some of the things i like best about the series so of course i think those gut and heartwrenching moments are important to experience i dont see how anyone can appreciate or experience the full measure of this part of the story without feeling the air knocked out of himher by the horror of bran and rickons death at theons hand or even moreso the murder of two innocent completely insignificant politically speaking children just isnt as powerful if your take is purely cerebral just understanding how the people of winterfell would feel rather than feeling it oneself but again thats just my preferencei also think its important to experience bran and rickons deaths in a very visceral way because i believe we are meant to despise theon at this point in the story in the books which is why although i like some of the theon scenes in this season like the confrontation with balon i wish they hadnt been included because i think its far too early for us to sympathize with or feel an understanding for theon and his behavior again purely subjective based on my experience as a reader but i really hated him and thought he was a total dick at this point in the story hopelessly irredeemable and then came reek far more powerful to go through that portion of his story and start to actually root for him in adwd for theon for gods sake having come from despising him more than any other character"

"bikie",2012-05-20,"not claiming to be the most hyperaware book reader but when i read this segment in the book it one of my comatose moments where i just stared off in the distance at what grrm had done to me when i saw the bran chapter later on in the book i was shocked and confused i havent spoken to a single nonbook reader who thins they are dead bran pointing out it is the place he sent the orphans is like a vegas splashy sign telling the audience its not them i think it was a major blown opportunity by the show to give the audience a great charge and further feeling of unpredictability in the show i just dont see why they didnt leave it to the audience to recognize the farmer as the same one bran spoke to in the last episode letting them put together it was this guy that bran sent the orphans too why even bother feigning their death if you didnt give the audience any reason to believe in it it also shows you that if the producers of the show didnt trust the audience to remember the farmer from one episode before its no secret why they didnt give us the arya vs tickler scene in another season"

"Mulled Wino",2012-05-15,"if the dagmerramsey theory does turn out to be true there are going to be some backstory questions that demand answers if we are to assume that dagmer is ramsey then we can only assume that he was sent by roose to the iron islands to intercept theon and persuade him into attacking winterfell if thats true then besides the questions about why the other iron born arent suspicious of theons mysterious lieutenant the lannisterboltonfrey plot starts to make no sense at allbolton might have designs on the warden of the north title but no other northmen would seek to depose the starks so they are utterly isolated they only gain strength by allying with the freys but the freys only defect once it becomes apparent that robb has broken his vow to marry a frey that is the juncture at which opportunity presents itself to roose bolton and that would be the point when he moves people into a position to take winterfell if dagmer is ramsey then it would require us to assume that roose bolton set his plan in motion long before he even knew he would have the slightest possibility of carrying it through maybe roose can see the future in tv gotthe one thing that i am now sure of is that reek will not turn up until theon takes on that persona i dont think this will hurt the story the ramseyreek thing requires a lot of background to fully understand and its now superfluous given that dagmer is the one urging theon to be a cruel and ruthless leaderone issue is still outstanding if dagmer isnt ramsey how will the boltons take winterfell theon could hold it against ramsays putative force of 300 with his own limited number of iron born maybe luwin will open the gates to the northmen thinking that they are liberatorsthat or maybe it will happen after roose comes northi also agree that the reek story wont lose any tv appeal if the reek persona starts with theon"

"madman2711",2012-05-20,"its a stupid ideea if ramsay  dagmer and i dont think this will work anyway all the arguments for this are details that are by far missinterpreted or selfinduced theory plots ok he has a torn sigil on his armorplate  though ironborns are armorfobes only victarion is the exception does this mean he is ramsay no it means that probably the armor was damaged during filming and didnt wasted some budget â<U+0080>â on refilming the scene with the armor repaired probably dagmer is asha spy or lover aka qarl it would be making more sense if dd wants people not to lose their faith in got should quit making stuff up and daviate less from the books as they are well written ok maybe the pov chapters are not always action packed but we arent watching spartacus to demand ta and blood every episode"
"Fengari",2012-05-20,"i dont buy this for one second lets examine the arguments in favor  dagmer is taking on the role of reek they need someone to be the devil on theons shoulder to keep him redeemable later on after all all the atrocities theon commits werent his own ideas and that help us sympathise with him later that i believe is the reason for dagmer taking that role not to set him up as ramsay yes if dagmer does not become ramsay we will loose the irony of theon being punished by ramsay for the very acts he himself told him to commit but i feel that is a minor loss the impact of the torture on theon will still be there  roose knew ser rodrick was killed and the raven was sent before that happened we dont see the ravens are being sent so that is not conclusive anyway the ravens theon tells maester luwin to send are to his father and sister not robbroose it is only logical that luwin would try to send ravens to robb and his bannermen as soon as possible to tell what has really happened its not because we havent seen that that it cant have happened i would say it is more likely than dagmer sending a raven to roose  asha who would have known him as not ironborn never met him from the article dreamcatcher linked so it has not been disproven that this theory is right but that does certainly not mean that it is proven that it is right after all the other crewmembers are also in a good position to question dagmer being there if he isnt someone they know already after all if theyre unwilling to follow a captain they know to be their kings son why would they follow a first mate they dont know at all  there is no other inside guy to betray theon and let ramsays men in there is no need for one yes winterfell can be held with as few as 500 men theon has nowhere near that number that is why he needs his sister to bring them do you think he would ask for yaras help if he didnt really need her ramsays troops can just take the castle the only reason cassel didnt in the books was his daughters head in a noose  theres a lot of screentime for dagmer see above he is needed to be the devil on theons shoulder the only screentime he gets is when he gives his advice and watches it unfold  we dont see dagmer interact with the other ironborn sure that is because he is a minor character needed only for his interactions with the major character and the other ironborn are little more than extras i also assume his kissing the captains ass may not fall well with the crewmembers who would have preferred just ignoring him and doing what they wanted  tv dagmer doesnt know theon from childhood like book dagmer i think that is just a bit of background that was cut no point going into that relationship if it leads nowhere  theres no clear motivation for dagmer to help theon it could be hes just an ambitious man who sees the opportunity of helping the kings son out  they wouldnt cast that actor if he was to die at the end of the season euhm sean bean anyone"
"TKO",2012-05-20,"i dont buy the dagmer  ramsay idea for all the obvious reasons others have stated it would be true clown shoes moment for the series if they somehow tried to contort things to fit such a scheme on the other hand dagmer filling in some of the narrative gap for ramsay being awol  sure thats obviously happening a bit but what did strike me is what some have brought up  from the very start dagmer seems to stand apart from the rest of the ironborn apart from everyone really except for theon who is the only person he communicates with on screen as far as i can remember they really only show him when theon is agonizing over a course of action attack the stony shore as commanded or feint at torrhens square and take winterfell keep ser rodrik prisoner or execute him keep searching for bran and rickon or kill the orphans in their place dont laugh but the comparison that leapt to my mind was tyler durden from fight club  that he is theons alterego as durden was to the narrator ed nortons character the figurative devil sitting on his shoulder telling him to execute ser rodrik kill the orphans and leading him to the idea of taking winterfell in the first place since youre seeing it from the narrators insane point of view it doesnt dawn on you right away that hes really the other half of the same person ok that would be a bit clown shoes as well  its been done before and not just by fight club but its still more sensible to me than dagmer literally being ramsay i thought this aswell but in the last episode you can see dagmer drag luwin to see the charred bodies while theon is addressing the crowd also when luwin says what have you done he is addressing cletjaw"
"HyacinthGirl",2012-05-21,"at the very least hes one of the bastards boys if not ramsay"
"JilaX",2012-05-23,"probably the single worst theory in the history of the internetand this is the same internet slinging stuff around about sopranossome of that stuff was really out there the idea that someone who is as old looking as his father infiltrated pyke to a degreelength of time that no other iron men questioned him being the first mate of the boat when they dont even respect their kings son enough to listen to him in case robb stark decided to send theon back to pyke nvmthis cant be realim almost convinced this is a trolling theory at this pointyou didnt really watch the episode where hes introduced closesly he solely appears when yara and the cre are convieniently far away hes the only one who claims to be first mate and hes not at any point recognized by any of theons men its not far fetched that they simply see him as theons dog followin him around loyallyin fact the entire scene he first appears in seems to suggest that he is just that an outsider rather than someone who fits in on the iron islandslol  i agree with you that there is no way that ramsay and dagmer could be the same person its just too much of a stretch and i agree that it would take way too much time and guessing for ramsay to go to pyke and somehow become a first mate on a possibility that theon would go back therehes the only one who says hes the first mate and makes sure not to mention it in front of any of the crew members characters on this show dont always tell the truththis guy argues dagmarramsey httpwwwtvequalsthonorreview i sort of like the idea because i really enjoyed ramseys switcharoo in the books and there really does seem to be something more to dagmar but i dont like it because 1 the actor seems to old to be rooses son and 2 its not satisfactory that ramsey would have established himself at pyke early enough to pull this off it also would suggest that roose decided to betray robb very early on whereas ive always thought roose was onboard with robb as long as robb was successful and only decided to betray him when it began to appear that robb would not succeed 1 disagree it depends entirely on when he had his son as he was a bastard the age gap doesnt have to be that large2 like ive said earlier nothing indicates hes established himself on pykeive had the feeling roose always decided to betray robb early on this is simply a matter of opinions though2i agree with the first part of your post but as far as alfie allen not returning to play reektheon in the adwd storyline i dont think its a done deal other hbo series most prominiently the wire placed popular characters on hiatus for a season or more at a time and brought them back as the plot called for them if d  d are as smart as i think they are they see the benefit in having a fine actor like allen breath life into one of the most intriguing characters in the asoiaf universe and do whatever it takes to retain his servicesthey have him on a 6 season contract if im not mistaken so theyre gonna spread the torture scenes out over the seasons id guess probably put in an escape attempt or something simmilar to make it extra interesting would fit what theyve done with danys storyline agreed i was looking at the pictures and despite roose being younger he looks about 55 while dagmer looks early 30s to meroose isnt younger actorwise ralph ineson is born in 1969 while roose is born somewhere around 1960 or before cant find an exact date the people thinking hes younger are reading about the irish footballer who shares his name"
"ThePickler",2012-05-24,"one possibility is that when ramsay comes to liberate winterfell dagmer will betray the ironborn by opening the gate disarming theon or something like that this would complete his role as reekramsay who betrayed theon is similar fashion as to how dagmer ended up on the iron islands all i can think of is that they want us to overlook that"
"Archmaester Marwin",2012-05-24,"i dont know about dagmer being ramsay but is it just me or do dagmer and many of the other ironborn wear camo commando looking hoodies then you have the greyjoys wearing the longest vests ever i think its a costume fail"
"Sarnius",2012-05-20,"im a bit confused here i thought the real reason cat let jaime go was because she wanted her daughters back after shed heard shed lost 2 of her children is it possible shed already had the letter im sorry but i cant find a reason other than that for cat to become a traitor and let the man whod nearly killed her child to go"
"Ran",2012-05-20,"it was explained right before jaime lannister is going to be killed by the karstarks before the night is done and before robb arrives catelyns choice is to let him be killed  inviting reprisals against her daughters and certainly losing him as a possible trade for them  or letting him go in the hopes that he survives and that brienne safely delivers him to kl to see her daughters returned it worked okay for me but its true that the way it is in the novels in richer and more emotionally textured"
"Mad Queen",2012-05-20,"ive been thinking about this since i saw the episode and at first i thought releasing jaime in the show would make cat an even worse traitor but ive since decided that in the show her reasons might actually be better because its an emergency and shes forced to act if she doesnt release him her daughters might get killed in reprisal but having better reasons doesnt make the story better i still prefer the way its in the books its why cat gets so much love and hate from us"
"Hear Us Roar",2012-05-14,"it seems that they are really trying to make cersei more likeable in the show at the expense of joffrey they are making him in to a bigger maniac then he actually may be if cersei does something bad joff has to top her in the next scene also he ends up taking the blame for her actions as well iekilling roberts bastard children an example would be the torture of the prostitute scene a few eps back we just saw joff ordering sansa stripped and beaten at court but then we had another scene where he does the same right after what do you guys think what will joff look like by the end of this"
"Envie",2012-05-14,"what will joff look like by the end of this the same as he does now a despised evil little shithead his end is not far off as we all know margaery arrives to become the new queentobe soon and the wedding  end of joffrey will leave viewers with the same sickened satisfaction as we had in the books cerseis changes are more pronounced than joffreys in my opinion shes much more likable and easy to sympathize with in the series"

"Mad Queen",2012-05-14,"i have always tried to sympathize with cersei in the books but it was impossible i actually like that they changed that in the show joffrey has always been a sociopath and i think he would have done in the books everything he did in the show were he as old"
"Faraday",2012-05-14,"eh its a fair departure but the character is still very recognisable do you ever imagining her opening up to him in that way in the book as far as i remember she never admits to the incest right on the whole i cant fault the changes there have been a few changes some subtle  some more pronounced they definitely make her morehuman well more likeable is probably more accurate i personally felt robert came across as less likeable slightly than in the books which helped her in season 1 her attitude to joffrey in the show seems like the type of thing youd expect  she loves him but clearly knows theres something very wrong i mean we still get enough moments like last week where shes fairly dislikeable so its finenot bad changes lena headey is doing a terrific job"
"StarkWard",2012-05-14,"the part where she holds her naveltummyheart while threatening to cry was amazing i dont think i could have imagined book cersei as that clearly show cersei is less delusional and i do appreciate that better to have her really gray now so viewers will be more confused when she goes downhill"
"teemo",2012-05-14,"i agree with you tv cersei is definitely different they are trying to make joffrey into as big of a villain as possible he is the got superstar villain right now people love to hate on him so why give cersei so much accountability when it can easily be handed to joffrey baby killing for instance they find it easier to make her more like an empathetic struggling woman with some cruelty in her but nowhere near what her son possessesuh wrong cersei is bad if not worse than joffrey and yes that is 100 true this is the woman that gave people to qyburn never once in her povs did she show any kind of remorse for killing someonenot only that but she didnt even think twice about it and as far as the price of her sins she does not care she doesnt fret over her past sins or worry that joffrey is an abomination like a targaryen can be because hes a product of her incest give me a break cersei spends her time plotting her next sin not repenting old ones and most of all she doesnt talk to tyrion about this kind of stuff are you kidding discussing her and jaime with him sure he knows but she would never she never talked about it to anyone and she loved joffreys fierce and brutal personality she was always bitching in her head about how tommen wasnt as tough and as much of a lion as joffrey was im guessing that when joffrey dies they will make cersei into more of a villain especially since we get to see into her sick little mind in affc but the writers probably dont want a middleaged woman stealing the villain kids thunder at the momentthere is a chance that the whole price for our sins bit though was just her gameplaying tyrion they have recently been in some terrible fights with the whole the debt will be paid bit from tyrion so maybe its all a scheme shrug but they have definitely toned her evilness down for the time being you never know for awhile i thought tv tywin was an absolute idiot to not realize that something was up with arya and he knew it all along or at least for awhile so this is mostly speculation based on what ive seen so far of cersei but knowing this showit can all change next sunday edited by hk47 14 may 2012  1159 pm"
"Eddard Sand",2012-05-15,"there is a chance that the whole price for our sins bit though was just her gameplaying tyrion they have recently been in some terrible fights with the whole the debt will be paid bit from tyrion so maybe its all a scheme shrugalmost certainly is i cant stress enough how important the blackwater is for tyrions character he has spent the whole season preparing for the defense of the city all the while ticking off cersei i really hope we get to see tyrion sally forth to meet the enemy during the battle he needs to be pseudoassassinated by cerseis henchman"
"dtones520",2012-05-15,"i dont think that early book cersei isnt as crazy as later books cersei i think that joffrey dying and maggy the frog prophecies starting to come true really threw her off the deep end are they making her more sympathetic yes but non book readers mostly know she is a total bitch and is putting on a mask with tv you need to over dramatize some things cersei being a bit more sympathetic makes her losing it after joff dies more believable people know she is capable of pulling off some pretty bad stuff but once shes set off the deep end she is worse than joff thats what i think we will see in the endif we get there"
"Prince of Dragonstone",2012-05-15,"we didnt really get to see the true depths of cerseis depravity until affc anyway yes she always was a conniving shrew but there were a few moments when she did have a human touch it was when we got a closer look in book 4 when we peek into her mindand it wasnt pretty"

"House Snow",2012-05-15,"i think you are missing my point im not saying that your desription of her is wrongits not but it is a description of a character with a pretty narrow range of emotions that book cersei was either too dense to know joff was crazy or just didnt want to admit it doesnt matter since it still leaves as this character that you pretty much describe in one wordcrazy show cersei actually has real motives for what she does where book cersei was based on a silly prophecy and an unseen childhood id rather have the cersei that makes a bit of sense like i said too many of the femal characters in the books had motives that didnt ring true edited by house snow 15 may 2012  0835 pm"

"sarah.jenice",2012-05-16,"i dont think that early book cersei isnt as crazy as later books cersei i think that joffrey dying and maggy the frog prophecies starting to come true really threw her off the deep end are they making her more sympathetic yes but non book readers mostly know she is a total bitch and is putting on a maskwith tv you need to over dramatize some things cersei being a bit more sympathetic makes her losing it after joff dies more believable people know she is capable of pulling off some pretty bad stuff but once shes set off the deep end she is worse than joff thats what i think we will see in the endif we get therethis is exactly how i feel i actually like that theyve given more depth and sympathy to cersei and catelyn too and i think they will use it to really show cersei lose it over joffrey and tywins deathstheyve shown how much she hates tyrion and i cant agree that theyve softened her up too much because her calmly telling tyrion about his trying to be funny because of his big joke in ripping her mother open and causing her to bleed to death was pretty unforgettable i am also thinking that shae the funny whore will actually be taken by cersei because there is no other whore she could think tyrion was in love with please dont throw ros at us hbo and that will cause the huge riff between them before the battle on that note does anyone see show tyrion threatening to do to tommen whatever cersei has done to his captured whore i couldnt miss how tyrion ensured tommen was taken back to the keep before the riot and i would find it hard to believe tyrion would threaten tommens wellbeing even if shae was in danger cersei has been given some better qualities like worrying about screwing joffrey up but she has also been pretty awful book readers know a lot more and can color our opinions of her from knowing what she becomes but i dont think show watchers will forget that this is the woman who conspired to have king robert killed arrested ned stark leading to his death ordered all of the northern men in kings landing killed is holding sansa captive and forcing her to marry joffrey while fully knowing how brutalized sansa will be and has been treating fanfavorite tyrion horribly all season if we wrap it up with her trying to have tyrion killed telling sansa illyn payne is waiting to take their heads if they lose the battle and later show her downward spiral with the deaths of joffrey and tywin i think she wont lose too much of book cerseiall in all i am happy with how she is portrayed"
"Raksha the Demon",2012-05-16,"i dont agree cersei would never have confided in tyrion is based on the facts that she hates and despises the disgraceful dwarf brother she blames for their mothers death her pride her intelligence in being careful not to confide to anyone a terribly dangerous secret shell try to keep till the end which also has to do with her love for her children since it would be the end of them and various other reasons the fact that people can say she wouldnt do that doesnt have to do so much with her having a narrow range but more with the fact that after reading about her for five books we begin to know her i dont see how cersei confiding in tyrion and talking about sins and doubting joffreys sanity makes her more complex it removes or replaces a layer from the character to make her more conventional its not an amelioration imo same goes for that change in first season about her child with robert that she supposedly lost when in the book she abortedwhile i understand why they would change it for the sake of the show i didnt like it because cerseis deep hatred for robert is an important and interesting part of her character which is not groundless  he was unfaithful she never wanted to marry him she wanted rhaegar apparently she was maritally raped by him cersei is an interesting character and the reasons for her quite deranged mind such as the fact that she would obviously rather have been a man are fascinating imo there are some people who like her in the books of course they are not as numerous as those who like ned for example but this is normal and theres no need for every character to be super popular besides most people like hating cersei and personally i dont think i would enjoy the books or the show as much if i liked everybody agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree and as much as i dislike her as a person bookcersei is more interesting and entertaining a character than the muted quiet cersei in the tv series book cersei was capable of selfcontrol mostly when robert was alive but the intensity of her hatred for him was demonstrated by her refusal to bear any of his children make her accommodating and reasonable enough to give robert one child and youve started to defang the lioness cersei is a volatile burningangry and powerhungry woman who is also a mother not just a sad vulnerable mother who happens to have made a few little mistakes along the way and the real cersei would rather die than divulge or imply vulnerability to tyrion"

"sennahoj",2012-05-20,"i think maybe sam finds the dragonglass later on in season 3 when the nw is on the retreat so it would tie in with him slaying a white walker as for the battle at the fist i expect the producers will use some sort of cheap way to gloss over the battle like wights approaching blades drawn fade to black screams end credits"

"Rickon is FIERCE",2012-05-18,"thinking over a few of the changes or diversions fromadditions to the books has me wondering as the producers of the show have been informed of the endgame for the series are they letting us in on plot and character developments that were meant to be revealed in later books and if so how do you feel about it take lf brokering the tyrelllannister alliance some decry his appearance at renlys camp and harrenhal as deviations from the books but are they he disappeared from the books for quite some time and no one knows where the hell he was until he showed up to spirit sansa away from kl perhaps he did make one or both of those trips and interact with renly catelyn margaery andor tywin and grrm just felt the time was not yet right to let us know other tidbits include the leaving aside of all doubt regarding margaery tyrells ambition and the nature of stannis and melisandres relationship both of which we strongly suspect from previous books but neither was ever completely confirmed i realize mel makes reference to stannis being in her bed in one of her povs but i still saw room for interpretation if george wanted to make use of it is all this early revelation a good thing bad thing a necessary thing for my part i hate the idea that things are being ruined for me and some of the things i love about the books are the ambiguities the one and only reveal that i absolutely drooled over was the scene showing rickon violently smashing up a potato as he sat next to bran during his daily lord of winterfell duties as ive mentioned before i cant see the purpose for that act other than to foreshadow the savage vengeanceseeking beast rickons going to become ive thought the clues for this were pretty clear in the books but am thrilled to see what i feel is a little bit of additional support for this expectation of mine any other changes that might be reveals anyone can think of"
"zippypoodle",2012-05-19,"i suspect that margaerys clear calculating ambition in the show is a deviation from the novel rather than a true revelation of something above bookmargaery i like it because it sets up a much better conflict between margaery and cersei than the one we get in the books imo"
"Stanmore",2012-05-19,"ive wondered about this if george has really told dd where the story is going and they decide to stick to the same destination but not take all the same roots then theres a chance theyll drop red herrings that george has us all believing or overemphasise subtle foreshadowing that the book readers havent really picked up on yet to be honest though by this point the show has deviated far enough from things we know for sure happened in the books that we cant really know if any particular change is a refinement of georges overall plot or an extraneous addition of dds own invention i think the bigger worry is that the show overtakes the books if that occurs and they stick even vaguely to the story grrm has laid out for them then spoilers will be inevitable"
"Yuki_no_Jon",2012-05-19,"for me the changes are for the worse especially in this 7th episode they destroyed jons character i could bare arya been skow as a fool i mean by being face to face with tywin and not asking his death lets say it was the circumstances i even could bear the stealing of the dragons although come on a king in quarth even that hatefull and in the series even more danny doesnt deserve to have all her folk killed why her maids i could bear that because it is used to drive her to thu without taking too much time to explain her thinking and internal conflicts but i cant bare jon to follow ygritte and subsequently sleep with her by being a traitor to the watch weve seen clearly that even later when he really loved her chose the watch over her so even from that point the changes ruin and later revelations like jons choice or aryas going to the faceless men as about margery i cant decide if it is to drive us to believe in cerseis claims and margery to be the younger queen but for sure events that we already know are destroyed edit not to mention that even though not in episode 7 they killed stannis he would never have slept with melisandre only for having a son edited by yukinojon 19 may 2012  1206 pm"

"SerMixalot",2012-05-20,"for me alot the characterization has changed with the series for example with jon now i and qh would have to question whether he has already turned or started to turn or seriously started to consider turning his cloak due to lust for y that makes his turning on orders far less noble and pure and reluctant which goes directly torwards his character one will feel that he is far less guilty over sleeping with y now that he has been shown considering it wrt to arya we have lost much of her fouindations for becoming a super ninja her needlework her leadership on the road her being a mouse and a sheep all serve as the foundation for becoming a fm later in the series in the book these things went towards her losing her identity and becoming a shadow with many identities her becoming a ruthless killer which happens when she escapes harrenhall should now come as a completely out of character moment by this time in the book she had killed several men at her own hands"

"protar",2012-05-20,"does anyone else think aryas mention of darksister in this episode curious especially as it has yet to be mentioned in the books so far iirc there are some theories going around that arya will somehow obtain darksister so perhaps its a hint to that or maybe its simply just a wink and a nod to those theories"
"Nuttz",2012-05-14,"now its been a while since ive read cok so my memory may be a little hazy but here goes does the implied imprisonment of jon contradict the bookwildings if i remember correctly the wildings never capture members of the nights watch they either kill them or let them turn their cloaks there could also be some trouble further down the road if as some poeple have suggested qhorin and co are also captured as obviously they arent ones to turn their cloaks this may just be something i made up though regardless im worried about jons later cok stuff i loved qhorins final command to jon it seemed to go against all of his vows but with them at the same time furthermore i absolutely adored the final chapter or two with the rangers trying to flee but knowing that they were doomed there was something strangely poignant about their numbers slowly dropping each man staying behind to face his death all the while qhorin knowing they would never escape this could still happen my guess is that the wildings have already captured qhoring and the others or will soon they will all escape and then the wildings will give chase it will have the same effect somewhat but if what i said earlier is true then it may contradict some of the wildings principles im also anxious we wont get to see jon warging into ghost this season as its kind of important for ghost to discover the wilding army i wouldnt be surprised if its cut though both for budget reasons and because they havent set up jon being a warg yet one more thing show more ghost i understand the budget constraints with cgi but its not like theyre putting in dragons or anything theyre filming wolves and increasing their size they probably wouldnt even need to outsource it any film editor could create that effect given enough time regardless of that you would think they could cut some of the other stuff out in order to flesh out one of the most important relationships in the series the way theyre going its not going to mean anything when jon has to leave ghost before climbing the wall"
"victim",2012-05-14,"in my opinion it will unfold in one of two ways 1 qhorin will save jon from the lord of bones in the nick of time the small band of nights watch men start a march back to the fist of the first men slowly leaving characters to die qhorin gives his command to jon as he already knows if hes captured theyll take his head anyway  so it may as well be jon who kills him and infiltrates the wildlings 2 qhorin and co are already captives of the lord of bones and jon is told to turn his cloak as the only means of survival this wouldnt make all that much sense though given that ygritte already told qhorin he wouldnt be taken captive if he was caught obviously the first option works much better the desperate march would be so good on screen especially if theyre being followed by the eagle which weve already heard a few times in the background was jon being captured a coincidence i think not the only reason i see them taking option two is due to budget andor time restrictions"
"Arkash",2012-05-14,"from next weeks preview we see qhorin and jon in the hand of the wildlings that was such a relief to catch this quick image"
"victim",2012-05-14,"i cant believe i missed that it looks like they take qhorin prisoner as well then im pretty sure well get qhorins command still because in the description of episode 10 it says jon proves himself to qhorin i also watched an interview with kit where he says his favourite part of the season was his fight with qhorin"
"Hear Us Roar",2012-05-14,"qhorin will command him to kill him while they are prisoner to prove himself or they escape and are cornered and the he kills him"
"Envie",2012-05-14,"2 qhorin and co are already captives of the lord of bones and jon is told to turn his cloak as the only means of survival this wouldnt make all that much sense though given that ygritte already told qhorin he wouldnt be taken captive if he was caughtthis is the option i think theyre going to go with as its easier to film and still keeps the stage set for qhorin to order john to kill him as part of the plot like it was in the booksmaybe qhorin will already be injured and theyre about to kill him when jon newly captured arrives on the scene they throw them together in chains while they decide what to do with them or maybe mance rayder arrives on the scene at this point  and thats when qhorin gives jon his final order because he knows hes going to die anyways and sees this as the only way for jon to survive and get info to take back to the nights watch just like in the book"

"Bastard of Boston",2012-05-13,"nikolaj was right about one thing this episode definitely gave him a chance to flex his muscles a little bit after being trapped in a cage for most of the season the real cage too as much as my inner sadist appreciated jamies coldblooded plot to escape i have to admit that this muddies up this minor issue of redemption hes been kinda working towards that for awhilekind of a big dealbut waityes we all know this is a huge departure from the books but lets examine it in other terms as well  what does this mean for his character arc on the show is it possible to bounce back i know some people have mentioned this in the big allencompassing episode discussion topici gave it some thought as outofcharacter as it may initially seem we are talking about a man who attempted to murder bran there isnt much at this point that jamie wouldnt do in the name of selfpreservation is killing alton so that he could possibly escape that much out of character for jamie do we forget about the bran incident because bran didnt dieeven though he probably should have  and jamie intended for that to be the end result at what point is the point where we say this is where jamie endeavored to be better did it happen while in the cage obviously not if were using the show as a guideshould we look at jamie differently here or when you think about it isnt jamie the same old jamie"
"victim",2012-05-15,"i think the move is shocking based primarily off of what we know happens to him as book readers i watched the episode with friends who simply hate the guy because they know him as a villain and while it was shocking to me it seemed right up his alley for them so thats to say the only reason why it seems out of place is because we know what comes in the future ive heard the argument put forth that everything jaime does is by his own little honor code  be it killing bran to protect his sister and pseudochildren or killing aerys to protect the realm  and that he does this purely for himself i truly believe at this point of the story that jaime is a man without honor which is not to say he does not get some later a great example of what im talking about is when jaime turns on brienne the first chance he gets in asos even though he swore oaths and made promises to catelyn in the cell they clearly meant nothing to him even after she frees him he didnt care about her oaths because hes developed into a man that believes they are useless he tried to escape from brienne because he wanted to be free  he fought her for himself very much the same way he fought alton for himself there are two things that change his path briennes influence and the loss of his sword hand the latter of which was perfectly set up for in this episode when he says im useless at everything else neither of these things have happened yet so jaime is still the dipshit that pushed bran out a window and stabbed jory in the eye we arent meant to like him at this stage but most of us do because we know what he becomes"
"Currawong",2012-05-15,"my problem with the change as i said on the main episode discussion thread is that jaime is still a lannister and still has his notion of lannister family honour his idea of that honour is not the same as tywins as we see later on but it is still therre and killing alton is inconsistent with series 1 and the fight with ned a tv extra scene the jaime who refuses to finish off ned once one of the lannister guards wounds ned is not going to murder a cousin in cold blood no matter how desperate i can see how kill your very distant relative in desperation makes sense if we are only looking at a dramatic point for series 2 and that episode but imho it affects his subsequent character arc and especially the relationship with brienne brienne might forgive the killing of aerys once she hears his side of it and she might understand though not approve shoving bran out the window out of love for cersei but the brienne we see in the books would never allow herself to feel any sympathy at all for a man who killed his young cousin in cold blood changing jaime like that means also making a subtle but important change to the highly honourable brienne eta it also doesnt make sense in terms of his general reputation he hates being blamed as kingslayer for killing aerys which he sees was an honourable act but once word gets out that he murdered his cousin in an escape attempt no one will want to have anything to do with him especially his own lannister relatives and their men when we get to affc we see jaime leading his troops very effectively in the riverlands and they obviously respect him and his leadership but once word gets around from the stark army  and it will  that jaime murdered his cousin he will be a pariah even amongst lannisters tywin might approve but that would be all i think the scene would have been much better written by using alton as a decoy to play dead even if jaime had said he had to hit him over the head to produce realistic blood same effect and it would have allowed alton to escape with jaime and brienne same as cleos frey alton could be killed in some incident along the way same as cleos was if they didnt want to have alton go with them he could have remained and been executed by karstark in revenge same result  dead alton and escaped jaime but alton would have been seen to have acted honourably in assisting jaime and jaimes own honour would be intact edited by currawong 15 may 2012  0428 am"

"Jamie Lannister",2012-05-19,"the one thing the bran incident had going for it is the fact that in hindsight bran didnt die and jaime chose not to finish the job furthermore brans gone on to become a prodigious warg capable of taking over animalspeoples bodies its hardly an excuse but it gives the illusion of being a less insurmountable sinon the other hand i dont think alton can bounce back from being unceremoniously bludgeoned to death by a rock thats one fucking huge specter over tvjaimes head now"
"Stanmore",2012-05-19,"the thing that really bothers me about this death is how pointless it was i get the fact that jaime isnt far down the road to redemption at this point and i can see him becoming a kinslayer if the situation were desperate enough but what i cant get over is that theres absolutely no reason alton needs to die his death doesnt add anything to the escape attempt hes not killing him for love or duty or honour hes not killing out of anger or greed or jealousy as far as i can see the only reason jaime killed alton was to provide a shock for the television viewers theres no motive behind it and that really weakens jaime as a character"

"RL Terrill",2012-05-16,"i think that the writers want them to appear powerless they are both so very young and faced with situations that their lives up to that point have left them unprepared for learning how to over come that feeling of powerlessness is an act of maturity i believe that the writers intent is to be enable the view the ability to witness their gaining in maturity and emotional stability jons wandering around lost in the north with a prisoner who is testing him in every way possible is suppose to make him appear lost and confused to us and he is lost and alone for the first time in his life faced with his first full assault of a womans sexuality has to be a source of great confusion fear and desire what would you or i do in the face of such a powerful weapon in those circumstances he cannot hide the truth from ygritte and she is intelligent enough to use the only thing at her disposal in order to keep him off guard and vulnerable jon snow is a boy trying to grow into the choice he has made why should he not make mistakes many of them both big and small he has a long way to go in this story and where would the interest be if he was perfect and acted the part of a mature beyond his years kind of hero i think jon snow is an interesting character and watching him negotiate his path in life is a great story martins characters in the book series are all very flawed and very human that being real strength of the story imo as a writer he has an advantage in storytelling in that the reader adds their own imagination to the words creating a second level of perception denied to a watcher of film if the writers of the hbo series put all those stark flaws and humanness on the screen for the world to see it is in order to show us who the character is but because the viewer only has eyes with which to visualize the story and our imaginations are left out of our understanding of the story the characters may appear less than they truly are one other thing as viewers of episodic tv we have been trained to impatience and heavy handedness making us desire characters with little dimension martins characters are far from that and the writers of the series are doing an admirable job in putting a complicated and detailed story on film"

"gogorath",2012-05-17,"someone mentioned it above but i think one of the nonbook threads ive read said it best some of the people were wondering when certain things were going to happen  like the dragons growing up etc and one poster said though theyd never read the books they knew there were five and probably going to be seven or eight  and so maybe the expectations of pace that are inherent in a show without a roadmap without a real danger of cancellation now those arent accurate it was an astute comment"

"Ruka",2012-05-17,"ygritte doesnt desire jon snow she wants to sleep with him so she can escapedo you mean in the show because it is stated by tormund that jon is just an oblivious diptsht if he cant see that ygritte wants to bed him i think in the show she also desires him for a couple reasons bedding him breaks his oath and brings him closer to joining the freefolk i am not so sure she wants to escape him as much as she wants to turn him"
"ThePrinceOfSunspear",2012-05-17,"its quite shocking how horrible daenerys is being portrayed this season and how low shes fallen from the first season just a whining brat"
"Ser Giant",2012-05-17,"shes a whining brat throughout the books as well she is being portayed perfectly in the show"
"Serr Parker",2012-05-17,"i can see jon being a prisoner with halfhand and thats when the whole youll have to prove yourself conversation will go i can see it being an execution instead of a fight though agreed on most of the other stuff getting his sword took off him at crasters keep and generally getting told how terrible a steward he is makes him look like a child danny im quite happy with shes just a beggar queen whos finally got put in her place hopefully next season is when she starts to mature with conquering and such"

"victim",2012-05-14,"how does everyone else think it will unfold ill start by saying that jon is by far my favourite character  in both book and show  and that the capture surprised me quite a bit thats not to say i disliked it its a great way of getting to know more wildling characters earlier in the story though im curious to see how if it unfolds in a satisfying way or if it shreds my favourite part of acok to pieces i dont think its going to be as simple as the wildling band coming across qhorins group and jon turning his cloak as a means of survival therell be more to it than that im sure of it as there are still 3 hours to go i warn you now the rest of this post will be speculative crap i can feel one of two situations arising the first would be that qhorin attacks the wildling band to free jon they run away and are followed by a pretty curious eagle which if you listen carefully weve already heard a few times i like to think orell was the reason jon was captured by ygritte in the first place this works well as you still get them trudging through the snow leaving member after member to die in an attempt to delay the wildlings  in other words please dont cut out squire dalbridges sacrifice its so sad and brings a whole new meaning to the watch itll give qhorin a chance to give jon his orders and the show can unfold from here exactly as the books do ideally this way is the way i am hoping it is done the other situation is the wildlings capture qhorin and his men as well as jon or they are already captives really where did they go once imprisoned qhorin can give jon his orders on turning his cloak knowing that hell die either way it doesnt have the same effect as the first option but perhaps due to budget or time restrictions it may be for the best they spent too long building up qhorin as a character to have him only appear in 3 scenes so im positive hell play some big part in jons story towards the end if qhorin doesnt give the order at all i may throw a brick through my television i was already terrified jon was going to sleep with ygritte too early because a man without honor had a moment though that all unwrapped nicely even though it doesnt have much to do with jon i love the idea that the fist of the first men battle with the others will begin at the end of this season the three horns blasting would be such a great cliffhanger"

"Thunderfist",2012-05-14,"so hbo has managed to completely change another main character what i always found really interesting about jaime was that his two great horrible acts could be somewhat justified he killed aerys to prevent the mad king from burning kings landing and killing hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians he threw bran stark from that window to save himself cersei joffrey tommen myrcella and possibly even tyrion but now to turn him into a sociopath who kills his own cousin for no apparent reason itâs not like he had an actual chance of escaping considering he was chained hand and foot and had the entire northern army around him oh well there goes jaimes entire redemption arc down the drain and whatever happened to the massive taboos against kinslaying"
"teemo",2012-05-15,"it was dumb not only could have alton just played dead but like you said  where is jaime supposed to go even though we didnt see it it sounds like a better attempt in the books"
"Arrogant Bastard",2012-05-15,"how do you justify jaime having neds men killed in agot you say he threw bran from the window to save himself and his family well he killed alton to save himself and escape in the books jaime didnt give one crap when cleos died so i dont think its that far fetched that he would kill a distant cousin if it meant a chance at saving himself"
"frametown",2012-05-15,"jaime is one of the most evil characters in the books people are easy to forgive and forget when it comes to this story i thought it was a great scene"
"ThePrinceOfSunspear",2012-05-15,"i agree jaime is a monster but that was due more to his thoughts coupled with the few monstrous acts he actually did perform like in a feast for crows he revisits the whole joffrey is attacked by nymeria incident that occurred with arya and sansa and he recalls how furious cersei was and how she wanted blood for blood then jaime reveals that if he had come upon arya first he probably would have hurt her even though she was just a child so to me jaime has always been a dark and twisty character but it was mostly in his mind and his psyche the show has ruined him by doing this and it was totally unwarranted i was actually very disturbed during the entire scene because i knew the moment the boy opened his mouth and started conversing with jaime that he was a dead man"
"Sxxman",2012-05-15,"no they are not abandoning jaimes redemption arc that is just ridiculous my question is does anyone else on the show know he killed alton or did they assume karstarks son did it also i dont think the show has defined kinslaying as a massive taboo so it should have to much of an affect on his redemption arc but we shall wait and see how his arc is handled"
"wolverine",2012-05-15,"dudejaime starts out as an unconscientious bastard in the books i can vividly remember how much i hated him you remember how cersei thought they could have maybe frightened bran or lied to him jaime just shoves him out a window so even evil queen cersei did not agree with that act jaime cares almost nothing for anyone other than himself it doesnt make a whole lot of sense that he just killed his cousin though like someone said above they could have faked that and both attacked the guard or something but as far as showing his morality it is right in line with the books imo in the first few books there are very few people who jaime would not kill maime torture insult etc if it was to his advantage or just pleased him"
"teemo",2012-05-15,"everyone can debate jaimes morality but its not even about that it didnt make any logical sense i think more of the complaint should be that jaime wouldnt have been that stupid he gains nothing from killing alton when he could play dead and jaime has no where to go hes obviously going to be captured almost immediately not even jaime can fight through as many men as there were there and he knows that"

"wood_dat_aye_could",2012-05-16,"did anyone recognize the actual dialog from the altonjamie scene did jamie have that exact same conversation w another lannister somewhere in the books obviously it would have ended differently but that whole story about the squire and the fat lannister mother sounded vaguely familiar could they have borrowed that story from another chapter book cousin and if so i think it was done well i looked at some of his chapters in sos but couldnt find the dialog there does anyone have any insight on what book or character this dialog is from if it is in fact taken somewhere from the books"
"Gemini",2012-05-16,"i really have a hard time seeing where people are so convinced that jaime is a complete sociopath i mean i believed it too until i read book three and four and when i went back to reread book one i figured id go back to hating him again but i didnt because i could see the subtle hints of his redeemable qualities for example tyrion remarks of him being the only one of his relatives to ever be kind to him while cersei and tywin were making tyrions life miserable jaime was an actual brother to him and looked out for him and when jaime pushed bran out of the window the line is the things i do for love he said with loathing it isnt hey cersei check this out he said smirking everything about that line implies that he didnt want to do what he was about to do but he felt like he had to for the sake of those he cares about mostly his sisterlover im not saying that it was an all right deed because he didnt want to do it of course it was still wrong im just saying he doesnt go around killing anyone he feels like and thinks its perfectly all right all of jaimes awful acts have been for the sake of others bran was for his sister aerys was for all of kings landing and jory and company was because he thought ned was responsible for his brothers capture once again im not saying i agree with these decisions except for aerys i consider jaime a hero for that one but he had very distinct motives for each and each demonstrated just how much jaime will do anything for someone he cares about the things i do for love really sums him up more than any other line and thats why i dont buy in to him killing ser alton alton was on his side he wasnt in jaimes way or a threat to someone jaime cares about i cant see him killing someone like that so pointlessly"
"victim",2012-05-16,"this little event could actually play into his redemptive arc further down the track even though this is just me hoping i think it could work nicely if he doesnt forget what he did and ends up regretting it say for example in his bathtub scene with brienne if he is telling her about why he killed bran and why he killed aerys and finally ends with his cousin hes an arrogant dick because of his abilities but when he loses his hand he begins to see himself as irrelevant and this is pretty much how his redemptive arc forms what if he goes out of his way to mention how killing alton was something he did for himself simply because he felt like he was more important than his cousin  perhaps even because he felt like his sister and children needed him to survive their oncoming hardships the large problem with jaimes asos arc is its not exactly a physical journey despite all the travelling it is mostly in his headspace he saves brienne because of a dream for example translating such a change in character is often very difficult to do on screen and usually has to be done through action and dialogue which is why i think a scene of him telling brienne stories regretfully will serve a valuable purpose while i mislike him killing alton i think the entire story or adaptation i should say needs to play out before we jump to any wicked conclusions i also personally dont think it destroys his redemptive arc i think it could make it better"
"Currawong",2012-05-16,"the large problem with jaimes asos arc is its not exactly a physical journey despite all the travelling it is mostly in his headspace he saves brienne because of a dream for example translating such a change in character is often very difficult to do on screen and usually has to be done through action and dialogue which is why i think a scene of him telling brienne stories regretfully will serve a valuable purposeyou make a very good point so much of the change in jaime is internal seen only through his pov in asos and affc it also applies to brienne in affc and it is interesting that we basically see their growing relationship as much through their thoughts when they are apart as anything when they are togetherthe internalisation of so much of asoiaf is a great problem for the series writers simply because there is so much general information and background given only through peoples thoughts and reflections not through any open action or dialogue hence the need for so many invented scenes or changes to book dialogue when writing grrm can spend several pages outlining some point about westeros history or the key families and it is important to us as readers because we get to know the world and also get to know some of the critical background to the current war but actuially showing that on screen without benefit of an overall narrator is extremely difficult"
"Elba the Intoner",2012-05-16,"i totally agree with gemini above he is far from a saint theres no question about that but we do learn that many of his evil acts were to protect others and for those he loved in particular except for in those cases where he was fighting a war he was portrayed that way in the first season too so thats why this seems so out of character oh well almost every character on the show has been acting out of character for them so far except for maybe theon bran and brienne and sansa whos had little screen time to do much of anything and davos who well hopefully see again soon"

"Jayaris",2012-05-17,"this has been discussed to death there are five other threads in this subforum where people raise the exact same concerns he gains nothing from killing alton thats not true if alton is alive hes either slowing him down or escaping on his own and risks notifying the camp of the escape attempt early i dont see how anyone could argue that leaving alton alive is a superior escape plan to killing him and thats if you assume that playing dead is a guaranteed success if the guard doesnt find altons acting credible or can see him breathing or his chest risingfalling he can tell hes alive from a distance his odds of escaping are greater if he kills alton and as you mention his chance of escape in the first place is ridiculously low so he needs all the help he can get"

"imladolen",2012-05-17,"i really have a hard time seeing where people are so convinced that jaime is a complete sociopath i mean i believed it too until i read book three and four and when i went back to reread book one i figured id go back to hating him again but i didnt because i could see the subtle hints of his redeemable qualities for example tyrion remarks of him being the only one of his relatives to ever be kind to him while cersei and tywin were making tyrions life miserable jaime was an actual brother to him and looked out for him and when jaime pushed bran out of the window the line is the things i do for love he said with loathing it isnt hey cersei check this out he said smirking everything about that line implies that he didnt want to do what he was about to do but he felt like he had to for the sake of those he cares about mostly his sisterlover im not saying that it was an all right deed because he didnt want to do it of course it was still wrong im just saying he doesnt go around killing anyone he feels like and thinks its perfectly all right all of jaimes awful acts have been for the sake of others bran was for his sister aerys was for all of kings landing and jory and company was because he thought ned was responsible for his brothers capture once again im not saying i agree with these decisions except for aerys i consider jaime a hero for that one but he had very distinct motives for each and each demonstrated just how much jaime will do anything for someone he cares about the things i do for love really sums him up more than any other line agreegif classbbcemoticon altagree and thats why i dont buy in to him killing ser alton alton was on his side he wasnt in jaimes way or a threat to someone jaime cares about i cant see him killing someone like that so pointlesslyi do not agree with this though alton wanted to be part of something think about the whole conversation the two just had and would do anything to help jaime one of the most important people on his side of the war escape this is war and in war people die sacrifices are made jaime had no familial love for alton he hardly even knew who the kid was and in jaimes opinion as well as the opinion of all the lannisters and other loyalists to joffreys reign the kingslayer is more important than some randomly minor lannister scionalton faking being dead wouldnt have worked it was the sounds of the attack the site of the shuddering alton who definitely did not come across as smart enough to fake that laying there and all the blood on his face that put the karstark idiot boy into surprise and shock long enough for him to not be paying attention to jaime personally i think the complaints about this scene stem simply from the fact that people can complain nerdrage groupthink all the typical bs that riles geeks up i do not think any of the arguments ive read against this scene hold any weight edited by imlad 17 may 2012  1110 am"
"Bride of Winter",2012-05-14,"it seems like people are pretty undecided on when exactly roose decided to switch sides in the seriessomething that really caught my eye was the scene where after all of robbs bannermen left roose stayed for a bit but left as robb chose to talk to jeyne instead based off of that im guessing theyre going to try to show that roose was on robbs side but is gradually being pushed towards betraying him what do you think of this change do you think in the series roose was always planning on betraying him or do you think that he decided to switch sides later after it seemed like robb was losing personally i like having more depth on rooses side but i think the scene where robb ignored roose for jeyne was plain idiotic on a level unrealistic even for robb hes generally supposed to have his head in the right place except for the sudden marriage this dragged out love story is making him look a lot more dumb than he needs to be not to mention if they simply make a comment in passing about the boltons and starks having been enemies for 10000 years they wouldnt have to make it look like robb is begging for the boltons betrayal of course this brings the question of what exactly his role was in the sack of winterfell which happened before the jeyne mess in both the series and show but for the most part im guessing the show is taking the side of robb driving roose to betray which although its quite possible isnt very nice to watch unfold before your eyes so my question is when do you think roose chose to betray robb in the books and do you think theyre going about it right in the show"
"victim",2012-05-14,"as to whether the time when roose actively changed sides it seems pretty difficult to determine in my opinion however roose always had the idea in his head that betrayal was an option and he was pushed in that direction by the disregarding of the freys theres more to his character than i just wanted to be warden of the north and i think its good theyre showing this softer side to start with"
"Sxxman",2012-05-14,"the way roose is portrayed in the books i knew from the moment he was described that he was going to betray robb and the only question to me was when just looks evil the way the show is going about it to me makes the betrayal and the rw even more devastating especially if roose explains to robb before he kills him that he didnt want to betray him but for selfpreservation he had to because the war was lost"
"WetHair",2012-05-14,"im of the opinion that roose wasnt always planning to switch sides but did it when it was likely robb was going to lose a bit like osha saying she had no intention of being drown at winterfell not that long before the rw he was telling robb that ramsay had theon and was flaying him and robb made it clear he didnt want theon flayed he wanted him dead roose went on about how he has value as a hostage yada yada and was getting robb and cat quite upset i dont see the point of this conversation if he was already planning on betraying robb why bring attention to himself so i think it wasnt that long before the rw"

"Areo Speedwagon",2012-05-15,"i think its a gradual thing hes an opportunist but its been a while since i read the books but doesnt robb execute karstark i think theyve set that up with jaime killing karstarks son in his escape attempt but if that didnt happen in the books oh well they still set it up in the show i think its good writing that dd are merging themes in different storylines one reason davos gives stannis for his mens distrust of melissandre is that shes a foreigner i watched the episode at 2am last night but doesnt karstark say that robb has been spending too much time with that foreign bitch for me one theme that emerged while reading the books is this sense that even without the long night by the end of this series westeros will be a totally different place in another storyline i think dany is going to have to deal with being a foreigner someone on another thread mentioning martins historical acumen brought up that by the end of the war of the roses the rennaissance had started i think thats where were headed and westerosi attitudes on foreigners is going to be a part of that back to roose lastly i think it was bran vras who mentioned in one of his extensive and i think very enjoyable threads that martin has established twists on classic monsters qyburn as his version of frankenstein and his monster the concept of wargs as a version of the werewolf myth then bran vras at least i think it was him mentioned roose being his version of the vampire obsessing about blood being far older than he looks evil and villainous etc i dont know if you saw it and it most likely is just something the actor thought would look good but when talisa comes to talk to robb you can see him in the background walking away and after a few steps he flings his cloak across his chest and over his shoulder it just struck me as something very much in line with nosferatu or an old bela lugosi dracula wrapped up in his cloak again 99 its nothing but it just struck me as draculaesque fr some reason edited by areo speedwagon 15 may 2012  0217 am"

"SerMixalot",2012-05-15,"i would love a timeline on the ramsey roose betrayal would clarify things in my head on the betrayal especially when they seem to diverge between the book and the series in the book ramsey betrayed robb by killing ser rodrik the tipping point where conspiring became action so clearly ramsey had planned it earlier i think we can assume that ramsey did it at his fathers behest so where prior to this did roose decide to betray robb this was before b r were killed before karstack was beheaded before cat let jl free before robb got married i may have the timeline off here rereading acok right now so will amend this in my mind in the tv show no active steps have been taken yet where roose has betrayed robb br have been killedrodriks death is at the hands of theon cat is going to do something with js which will likely lead shortly to karstaks beheading and robbs wedding now if ramsey as i would presume is going to take winterfell soon the roose would already have made his decision as none of the assumed triggers have happened yet and he would have had to communicate his wishes to ramsey and as has been established  communication by ravens can only be between castles so roose will have to have made his decision long before ramsey shows up at winterfell unless ramseys actions are not under rooses control which makes for some interesting considerations"

"sarah.jenice",2012-05-15,"i think rooses words in dance about boy lords being the ruin of any house were telling that he was at least alway considering his options of not following a boy king and looking for any opportunities that arrose like others have said i think robb losing the north his two younger brothersheirs marrying jeyne and ruining the frey alliance and stannis loss in the battle of the blackwater totally sealed the deal for him even though we havent learned all of the details at that point roose has already flipped sides by aryas last chapter in clash he goes to hunt wolves and all of the freys that are there with him are completely not on robbs side that one frey boy who was betrothed to arya cries about how he cant marry his princess anymore to arya and she tells him that she hopes his princess dies not knowing that it is her the thing that makes it the least clear for me is the timeline with ramsay sacking winterfell i dont think he did that without his fathers knowledge so maybe roose actually decided to flip sides the moment robb lost the north and happily conspired with his son to rid the north of the as many of the remaining forces loyal to the starks in the show it seems less clear as to when it will happen but i dont think they can not have the betrayal occur"

"Independent George",2012-05-14,"im not a purist by any stretch but jaimes murder scene seems to be a fundamental misreading of his character jaime is impulsive and has done some horrible things in his life but still adheres to his own sort of code even if nobody else around him sees it he would have killed his cousin for cerseis sake but not his own  especially after their reminisce when alton reminds him of what it felt like to be admired it was a brilliant scene right up until that point ncw is phenomenal at conveying jaimes internal conflicts but the murder completely destroys it all jaime constantly compares himself to the likes of arthur dayne and barristan selmy and finds himself wanting why would he murder a comparative innocent right after remembering what it was like to serve barristan and all the hopes and dreams he had for his own life its completely out of character i dont like to nitpick minor plot angles but the character suffers tremendously for it edited by independent george 14 may 2012  0642 am"

"David Selig",2012-05-14,"does the killing of distant cousins even count as kinslaying all cases of people being called kinslayer in the books have been for murderers of close kin siblings halfsiblings parents iirc rickard karstark tried to claim rbb would commit kinslaying if he executed him but nobody bought it"

"SerRodzilla",2012-05-15,"this is the second week in a row where i just had to scratch my head and wonder about character decisions last week was osha quietly getting out of bed to not wake up theon and then killing gaurds why didnt she just kill theonthis week i saw absolutely no purpose in jaime becoming a kinslayer they could have worked together just as easily to escape and then jaime would have had a better chance to escape as there would be two people fighting i found this to be bad writingor arya eyeing up her knife then lord tywins throat then not going to tell jaqen to kill him the whole point of the jaqen thing is she regrets it after they have all left not that she contemplated it while serving him"
"Chalkius Stark",2012-05-15,"i didnt mind him murdering his cousin as they were so distantly related it doesnt matter i mean the guy is meant to be cleos frey really doesnt even have the same name the issue is that he didnt need to be killed to escape it was lazy writing"
"mediterraneo",2012-05-15,"im not a purist by any stretch but jaimes murder scene seems to be a fundamental misreading of his characterwhy would he murder a comparative innocent right after remembering what it was like to serve barristan and all the hopes and dreams he had for his own life its completely out of character i dont like to nitpick minor plot angles but the character suffers tremendously for iti found the whole alton killing to be completely unnecessary the preceding conversation would have been a good character building moment but then they threw it all away for a shock twist not even a very effective one considering how sign posted it was â<U+0080><U+009C>i couldnt have done it till you arrived come closerâ<U+0080><U+009D> gee i wonder whats gonna happen nextim starting to wonder how much of the books the show runners have actually read i wont pretend jaime was ever a saint but adding in a pointless killing like this really messes with his long term character arci completely agree with the surprise above of the person who said this show had made it so well in so many ways up until now that it is so sad that they started botching thingsthe worst thing is that jaime becomes a kingslayer in a move that needs the stupidity of the karstark son to work why didnt he call a voice before entering the tigers cage because the books said that he had to die why did he had the keys on jaimes chain on his body toowhy making jaime a kinslayer no i do not buy the kinsfartherthanitwouldbeconvenientformedontcount theorybecause they are thinking at his arc as a wrestling turn face of a heel they are not thinking at it as the coherent evolution of an all around character on which we knew too little when we judged him for the first time this is very sad as it is gross writing as gross as giving to the supposed most dangerous knight in the world an escape plan based on kinslaying in the hope the guards will enter his cage with the chains instead of giving the alarm why on the earth did alton have jaimes chains key on his bodythe bad writing of the escape attempt can be survived a bad scene in a good series can happen im not against any changes for the tv version some one was brilliant like the roberts added scenes in kings landing the tv show helped me understand a couple of things on cersei i wasnt so sure off beforebut this kinslayer bodysnatcher that substituted jaime lannister in the series makes it jump the shark to me it will have much more very good things but it definitely stripped from me the idea that they were doing an almost perfect job this made me doubt that the series writer are thinking at the characters as all around persons and not as etiquettes physically violent villain childish delusional sadical witty sincere dwarfthat thing having special characters in special situations reparted in all of the sides of the conflicts is what makes game of thrones shine not just another fantasy simple story grown too long but a novel able to stand on his own in this years literaturei hoped that the very different beast the tv show is could stand as high as it and im frustrated in this"
"Fragile Bird",2012-05-15,"i completely agree with the surprise above of the person who said this show had made it so well in so many ways up until now that it is so sad that they started botching thingswhy making jaime a kinslayer no i do not buy the kinsfartherthanitwouldbeconvenientformedontcount theorybecause they are thinking at his arc as a wrestling turn face of a heel they are not thinking at it as the coherent evolution of an all around character on which we knew too little when we judged him for the first time this is very sad as it is gross writing as gross as giving to the supposed most dangerous knight in the world an escape plan based on kinslaying in the hope the guards will enter his cage with the chains instead of giving the alarm why on the earth did alton torrhen have jaimes chains key on his bodyi agree 100"
"ipsuel",2012-05-15,"i completely agree with the surprise above of the person who said this show had made it so well in so many ways up until now that it is so sad that they started botching thingsthe worst thing is that jaime becomes a kingslayer in a move that needs the stupidity of the karstark son to work why didnt he call a voice before entering the tigers cage because the books said that he had to die why did he had the keys on jaimes chain on his body toowhy making jaime a kinslayer no i do not buy the kinsfartherthanitwouldbeconvenientformedontcount theorybecause they are thinking at his arc as a wrestling turn face of a heel they are not thinking at it as the coherent evolution of an all around character on which we knew too little when we judged him for the first time this is very sad as it is gross writing as gross as giving to the supposed most dangerous knight in the world an escape plan based on kinslaying in the hope the guards will enter his cage with the chains instead of giving the alarm why on the earth did alton have jaimes chains key on his bodythe bad writing of the escape attempt can be survived a bad scene in a good series can happen im not against any changes for the tv version some one was brilliant like the roberts added scenes in kings landing the tv show helped me understand a couple of things on cersei i wasnt so sure off beforebut this kinslayer bodysnatcher that substituted jaime lannister in the series makes it jump the shark to me it will have much more very good things but it definitely stripped from me the idea that they were doing an almost perfect job this made me doubt that the series writer are thinking at the characters as all around persons and not as etiquettes physically violent villain childish delusional sadical witty sincere dwarfsnipit is concerning i agree the jaime change was just too much for me"
"The Monkey",2012-05-14,"in this episode robb want away to some place forgot where to negotiate a peace i understand it as a plot device the need to get him away from cat both so that she can release the kingslayer without robb interfering and so that he can sleep with and marry the westerling woman without cat interfering but what will come of this do you reckon"
"victim",2012-05-14,"he went to the crag the seat of house westerling in the books this is when robb gets injured and is nursed back to health by jeyne whether it unfolds like that in the show is hard to say according to the previews this is the episode where robb is betrayed though im assuming that is concerning cat jaime or rickard karstark as opposed to the revelation of talisa being jeyneedit i dont think robb was negotiated peace as much as accepting surrender edited by victim 14 may 2012  0830 pm"
"Laohu",2012-05-14,"i doubt robb is going to be injured as a result of the negotiations so i am definitely curious how he and jeynetalisa will do the deed i assume that this will be shown and not merely mentioned in later exposition for instance when they arrive back at his camp suddenly hand in hand in either case robb is probably coming back to his mother and his men as a hitchedbetrothed man and i cannot wait to see everyones reaction especially cats and rooses"
"Envie",2012-05-14,"since theyre not showing the battles i suspect they will not reveal the nature of how robb gets an arrow wound which jeyne westerling nurses him back to health over as done in the books i have a suspicion theyll show a scene or two of him already wounded and in bed in her familys home at the crag and due to close proximity and him being undressed they may have a short love scene with our without sex shown perhaps theyll even throw in her father catching them in a compromising position and robb doing the right thing by proposing to her this wasnt really described in detail in the books so the producers can take all the liberty they want with it in the show"
"Bride of Winter",2012-05-14,"i didnt actually realize hes probably not going to be injured until now well either way his arrow wound was what got him in her bed and introduced them in the first place and later they slept together once he found out about bran and rickon seeing as they already know eachother im guessing itll just cut straight to the sex"
"Ser Giant",2012-05-14,"theyll probably come to agreement that if robb marries jeyne he will have their fealty thus no fight at the crag"
"The Monkey",2012-05-15,"wait so house westerling has decided to negotiate a separate peace from its liege lords the lannisters wouldnt that be treason of course theyre going down that route eventually anyway but still"
"Pellaeon",2012-05-15,"they negotiate the surrender of the garrison not peace at all"
"sennahoj",2012-05-15,"would it be possible that robb is injured by a bannerman on the show karstark could challenge robb over catelyns releasing jaime i know its not in the books but its not inconceivable"
"SerMixalot",2012-05-15,"last night brienne mentions robb will be back tom so doubtful he got injured cause he was going to accept surrender not storm the castle inthat case it would be illogical he would have time to bed and betrothe talyne i wouldnt want to predict how they will play it out"
"WinterWarrior",2012-05-15,"i dont think robb will be injured i think he will find out that talisa is jeyne when they get to the crag to accept the surrender then in true hbo style they will cut right to the sex he will get hitched and go back to camp a few days later that will give jamie and brienne a few days to get away of course she obviously has some medical knowledge and there is a thing called moon tea but robb stark is as honorable as his father so the story does not go there and as we all know robbs honor will do him as much good as it did his father"
"Laohu",2012-05-15,"winter warrior you post made me think of something in the books do we know that jeyne is definitely not pregnant with robbs baby or was that left up in the air i think the last we hear from her is book 4 with jamies pov but she did not seem to be carrying a child then why do i feel like that is not a sure thing"

"birdsong66",2012-05-15,"its quite possible that jayne will comfort robb after he is betrayed by catelyn the singlemost person he trusts without question she above everyone else her betrayal releasing the kingslayer could be very much like a metaphorical death to him not requiring the knowledge of his two youngest siblings at all which forms the catalyst for sexmarriage both actions would result in the same sticky wicket situations in the book and ultimately suffice for the larger betrayals in the future for hbogoti watched an interview with fairley and she kept talking about the journey she goes on the horses the landscapes etcare we certain that hbo has her remaining with robb postjaime release im wondering because with all the adjustments from the books would they be crazy enough to have brienne jaime and catelyn make a break for kings landing together the interview got me wondering what changes will be made to this part of asos for season 3 thoughts like it hate it speak up yheard"

"AdiTarg",2012-05-15,"in the book i cried like a baby when they i thought they died i thought that they way they portrayed it on the show was clumsy and it wasnt as powerful as it should have been i mean two strak children just died and it had no emotional impact on me i thought it was poor editing with the scene coming at the end and being too short i still think it was a fantastic episode but to people who havent read the books that was probably handled in a very underwhelming matter"

"Aegnor",2012-05-08,"i dont know how well the moonblood scene will work in the tv series if sansa looked as she did in the pilot then sure or even if she looked young but she has grown fairly tall and i dont think its believable to say that she hasnt gone through puberty yet you remember during the cercei dinner scene marcella asks when sansa and joffrey will be maried and cercei says when the war is over in the books the wedding is supposed to occur when she gets her moonblood maybe they will still have the moonblood scene i just think it would be weird with an actress that is nearly 6 foot and clearly past that particular age"
"Aslerys",2012-05-08,"the episode description states that cersei counsels sansaand based on the previewsansa was holding her neckso this would be the scene where sansa gets her first moonbloodim glad the producers decided to keep the scene as this would make the audience who havent read the books realise she is still a child till this eventabout shae holding knife to sansai reckon that would be the dream sansa hasthat explains why she holds her neck as she woke upthe same thing about the hound talking to sansa scenei think that is also a dream sequencei agree with you i think she is just dreaming at least in the shae part besides shae doesnt have any reason to threat sansa at this point unless they decided to made up one"
"HouseLancaster",2012-05-08,"im starting to think weasel soup isnt happening at all no prisoners to speak of although that could change and would also help register bolton in the mind of the nonbook reading viewer as it will be his men and they missed a trick with the whole double meaning of weasel soup we never got to see weasel the kitchen girli think the last man she asks jaqen to kill after deciding that killing joffreytywin wont help her escape will be a soldier guarding a door allowing arya and gendry i predict hot pie will be left here but that would suck to escape having arya slaughter the guardsman might be too much of a jump at this pointhope im wrong though weasel soup was good funi still have faith but such a change doesnt now seem impossible arya not taking charge of her own life and ot killing the guard herself come season end seems like a waste of development though as has been said theyve kept her hands clean so far if hot pie and genrdy dont get a few scenes in the next episodes it wouldnt surprise me if atleast hot pie stayed behindhowever we know some slaughtering is going on next episode we know ayra calls in her final debt with jaqen in a way that displeases him in ep8 and we know she gets the coin in the season finale so for me killing the guard wouldnt displease jaqen and it wouldnt take 2 episodes i just think the circumstances of hr final debt will change slightly ie not northenmen roose etc it could all still fit in there somehow hopefully if kings landing gets an entire episode in blackwater the characters north will have the lions share in the other episodes"
"The Monkey",2012-05-08,"exactly the line ayra calls in her final debt with jaqen in a way that displeases him can only mean one thing he has started his willingness to kill anyone so he wouldnt be displeased if that was anyone but himself she might not be freeing bolton prisoners but surely something similar its just too good a plot point to miss up on as is her murder of the guard at the end of her last chapter"
"boojam",2012-05-08,"i still have faith but such a change doesnt now seem impossible arya not taking charge of her own life and ot killing the guard herself come season end seems like a waste of development though as has been said theyve kept her hands clean so far if hot pie and genrdy dont get a few scenes in the next episodes it wouldnt surprise me if atleast hot pie stayed behindhowever we know some slaughtering is going on next episode we know ayra calls in her final debt with jaqen in a way that displeases him in ep8 and we know she gets the coin in the season finale so for me killing the guard wouldnt displease jaqen and it wouldnt take 2 episodes i just think the circumstances of hr final debt will change slightly ie not northenmen roose etc it could all still fit in there somehow hopefully if kings landing gets an entire episode in blackwater the characters north will have the lions share in the other episodesi find it had to believe that dd are not found of aryas trick on jaqeni has all the makings of cleverly constructed drama and one of georges masterpieceswhat follows can be different that would not bother me i still expect something with more action than we have seen from jaqen"
"Arkash",2012-05-08,"could it have something to do with sansa losing it and trying to burn her bedmost obvious for me sansas bleeding and becoming mad and shae stopping heras for the arya trick i think from the quick summary of episode 8 we sure will have it the ending might differs but she will surely ask jaqen to kill jaqen edited by arkash 08 may 2012  0707 pm"

"Khal-a-bunga",2012-05-08,"im thinking well see tywin depart harrenhal at the end of this episode leaving some approximation of weasel soup for episode eight as far as how i see things playing out with theon and bran  rickon  id imagine the audience will be left to believe theyre dead at the end of the next episode from the preview we can see theon assaulting the man who bran allowed to take two orphan boys in episode five theon will come upon his home and ask where the two boys from winterfell are im not sure how it will be play out but im thinking that dagmer and theon enter a barn or some such where the man says the boys are and the scene may end with saod barn being set on fire killing the two boys and charring their bodies to avoid identification im basing that off of the picture of theon at the gates of winterfell with two burned bodies hanging on either side of the gate we shall see though"
"House Snow",2012-05-08,"ok i want them dead the scene just is just after  what looks like a number of soldiers  bandits dead in the courtyard not clear whats thats about  arya seems to still be tywins servant so thats oddi think they are going to skip the whole roose gamit at harrenhal not a lot of plot advancement therestarting to think weasel soup happens this episode seems earlylooks like weasel soup is going to be structured differently i think ending with jaqen departing and arya escapingbut its hard to puzzle out what its going to be the last events at harrenhal e6 clouds things yeah thats not happening either the episode summaries are pretty obvious about this"

"Caro99",2012-05-09,"i think the man without honor means jaime though theon can also be named that but jaime is called a man without honor by cat in her last chapter of acok and in the critics trailer we see taht they will be keeping most of what was said in that chapter with jaime saying that its too hard to keep all the vows they make you swear im sure i am pretty wrong about this but i cant get my mind around talisa not being a lannister sppy maybe she will be the family relative jaime will meet and not alton cant wait to see the sansa scenes in this episode i think we will have her in 3 scenes the moonblood breakfast with cersei and the hound and her talking on the serpentine steps which is what i am looking forward above all i am sure this is not a dream sequence since they do have a conversation in the books where she calls him horrid and so the tv sandor could say some day you will be glad of the horrible things that i do i wonder though why would shae threatened sansa with a knife maybe cause she discovers her freaking out about the moonblood or maybe since shae practically almost told sansa not to trust her sansa will have a nightmare about it and how shae threatens her with the knife so she wakes up holding her throat but the almost rape scene was quote horrid so it would be better to have sansa having a nightmare about that sophie does look older than 15 the age she was when she shot that scene probably but it has already been stated in the show that sansa has not had he rmoonblood in last seasons final apisode so if they make a reference to that and joff saying taht as soon as she has her moon blood hell put a son in her it would be better edited by caro99 09 may 2012  0129 pm"

"Versiroth",2012-05-10,"gotta admit im surprised that the preview suggests theon is going to have a fairly large role this episode id have thought that since next episode is called the prince of winterfell thats where theyd fit most of the rest of his storyline in its a shame i mean the scenes are incredibly wellacted directed written etc but i just fucking hate theontheons story arc is one of tragedy and one of the most interesting imo hes never felt like he was part of anything and the first time he tries to prove himself it all goes horribly wrong he ends up betraying people that he obviously didnt want to betray performing horrible acts that you could tell he didnt want to do and then imprisoned tortured and broken i hated him when he was theon too though i did have some sympathy for him but after becoming reek wow i felt horrible for the guy i think theyre handling his story even better in the tv show because you can see the inner struggle in his faceone character ive always hated that ive never quite got why people liked him is jaime lannister it actually kind of pissed me off when it was obvious that grrm was trying to make him into some sort of greyredeeming hero with his story arc i wanted to see the guy suffer and still do now edited by versiroth 10 may 2012  1119 am"

"DragonAge93",2012-05-13,"when i read the hotu part in the book i kinda got lost throughout it and didnt know what the hell was happening i went online afterwards to see what the visions meant and i have to agree with sennahoj even if they dont show the visions it doesnt really matter they didnt show the toj flashbacks and we got along fine without it at first i wanted them to be in but now reading sennas post i agree that it really wont phase me all that much if they dont put them in now because it does get lost on the reader eventually readers just want it to be in the show since its the only significant thing that happened to dany in acok"

"Morrigan",2012-05-13,"i think the last man she asks jaqen to kill after deciding that killing joffreytywin wont help her escape will be a soldier guarding a door allowing arya and gendry i predict hot pie will be left here but that would suck to escape having arya slaughter the guardsman might be too much of a jump at this pointhope im wrong though weasel soup was good funthat cannot happen first of all theres an episode synopsis where apparently arya calls in the third debt in a way that displeases jaqen so it has to be something special eg him unless he helps with whatever scheme she has and not just killing a guard and second arya has to kill the guard herself preferably with dropping the coin and she has to say valar morghulis this is just too important i think this will happen in the very last episode though since its titled valar morghulisexactly the line ayra calls in her final debt with jaqen in a way that displeases him can only mean one thing he has started his willingness to kill anyone so he wouldnt be displeased if that was anyone but himself she might not be freeing bolton prisoners but surely something similar its just too good a plot point to miss up on as is her murder of the guard at the end of her last chapteryes thank youhey folks sorry if someone has already said this but it looks to me like the part with shaeknifesansa is a dream you can see sansa waking up clutching her throat as if shes had a nightmare and then two seconds later you see shae with a knife to her throat i think for the purposes of this preview they are showing those two moments out of order playing off of what shae said to sansa an episode or two ago about not trusting anyone it makes sensethey do often show scenes out of orders or cleverly edit scenes to be very misleading in the previews i remember the preview for the pointy end back in s1 you hear meryn trant saying sounding a bit weird kill the girl while showing arya running down the steps the reason it sounds weird was because they edited the quote in truth he says kill the braavosi get the girl or something like that i thought it was suspect watching the preview too since there was no way theyd want to kill an important hostage like arya and it all made sense in the episode and of course they say that when confronting syrio not when arya runs away to the dragon skull area that was just a montage for the previewso yeah take previews with a grain of salt basically smilepng classbbcemoticon alt "
