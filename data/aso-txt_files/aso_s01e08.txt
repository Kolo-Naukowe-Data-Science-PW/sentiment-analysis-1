"Xxtayce",2011-06-07,"episode was awesome not one moment of useless dialogue or random sex just for the sake of ratings pure grrm the way its supposed to be fencinggif classbbcemoticon altfencing  aryasyrio  very well done it made my heart break just as much as when i read it rob the battle lord  growing into a man i was very happy to see the change the fight with the greatjohn seemed a little off or maybe it was his reaction to it but thats a minor complaint rickon  im sure most of the folks at home were like who the heck is that i wouldve liked to see much more of him earlier on so he wasnt just a random throwin oshabran  i can see the relationship growing very wellplayed cerseijoffrey  seems like shes taking a more obvious hand in the series than she did in the books wasnt it joff who kicked out selmy instead of her still he gave me a squee of pride to see him throw off his cloak and sword cerseisansa  evilevil evil sansa seemed more aware of what she was doing here than in the books though less of a mindless idiot and cersei more of an evil witch i like the change its like now that her sons in powerwe get to see the real cersei that was hiding behind robert all these years sansasandor  just enough of a hint to be perfect varysned  oh poor ned so doomed im glad they included this scene although i was expecting them to drop it out in favor of some random nudity tyrion  ah my giant of lannister is it just meor does he seem more afraid here than he did in writing he seemed to me to be constantly mocking everyone around him in the books no less cowardly but certainly more interesting to watch id think danaerysdrogo  i love watching her character transformation here still a little naieve but still a queen and mirri maaz dur sp gave just enough creepy foreboding to keep me happy anyway only two more to go and so much left to do"
"Xxtayce",2011-06-07,"ps yay wolves i totally forgot this was in this episode loved seeing grey wind under the table and then to jump out at robs command ghost was a little loud and wasnt really in the fight as much as id hoped but theres only so much you can do with trained wild animals and actors i suppose i approve of the way it was done though the white walker didnt seem nearly as white eyes nearly as blue or nearly as creepy as it was in the beginning"

"arantius",2011-06-07,"absolutely loved this episode best one yet so many awesome scenes with dialogue straight out of the bookreally loved the bit where bran tells rickon that robbs gone to free father and then theyll come home with mother and rickon says no they wont so much eery foreshadowing in those few wordsedit for accuracy edited by morningsword 07 june 2011  0813 am"

"NW Deserter",2011-06-07,"forgot to mention something in my earlier postreview i know we dont talk about the music in this series much but i feel this is worth mentioning  when robb first gets sansas letter and luwin is explaining what it means theres really slow piece of music in the back that almost screams this dude is about to go kick some ass and it starts to swell as the birds fly out and then hits a peak as the scene shifts to catelyn running up the stairs to lysa gave me chills even on my second viewing i think what makes it even better is the crafty editing most of the first half of the episode is dealing with immediate aftermath of neds imprisonment so we see each of his family members in turn  and we end on the one who loves him most dearly cat one of those little pieces of brilliance imo especially with the music there"
"Ser Warpechowski",2011-06-07,"what kind of a shit scout are you if you actually count the enemys forces with your fingers in the air one that gets caughtalso the guards said he looked to be counting maybe he was writing numbers down and the guards didnt knew how to read edited by ser warpechowski 07 june 2011  0812 am"
"legba11",2011-06-07,"stannis is a much more significant character than craster who will be in two or three episodes or quorin halfhand who will be the secondary character in the episodes he gets stannis would be perfect for a big namer again i dont expect an a lister its not hbos method he is very significant he is the rightful king now no one else could argue that point i dont think the targaryns pass the throne to women he is a heroic yet tragicly flawed character the type of role great actors win awards for and he is not going to be on screen the most for season 2 clearly this will be tyrion a larger role in season 3 im not sure who will have the most screen time there his role will be larger in the series than the books as the povs are gone not being the main character makes the time demands much less which helps a busy actor the actors who play the leads of the various books are fully committed time wise they cannot work for those 3 months of filming movies and tv series frequently work around the schedule of bigger name actors"
"LugaJetboyGirl-irra",2011-06-07,"i just want to point how much i think the actor who plays alliser thorne is nailing his part its like what everyone says about joffery how he has a douchey face and you just hate even seeing him every time thorne comes on screen he has that look on his face such as when he called jon a traitors bastard and then did that ever so simple little smirk the thorne smirk of superciliousness i just want to punch him in the fucking face alll thorne has to do is look and i want to claw his fucking eyes out arrrggghhhhhhits brilliant edited by jetboygirl 07 june 2011  0838 am"

"kungtotte",2011-06-07,"i really liked the casting of the greatjon and how the character was played he feels a bit like hamish and campbell from braveheart and of course james cosmocampbell plays the old bear which is pretty much exactly the mental image i had of the greatjon when i was reading the bookswell we didnt get all dressed up for nothing"
"Andhaira",2011-06-07,"great episode not the best but close syrios fight wasnt choreographed all that well i cant suspend disbelief enough to belive that he knocked out those armoered helmed men with a swift knock to the head otherwise everything else rocked we got some new lore from the hands of grrm himself apparently the others sleep under the ice for thousands of years before reawakening i sure hope they show selmy killing lannister guardsmen next episode instead of us just hearing about it like in the books drogo was awesome i will definately watch the new conan movie now oh and ghost should be mute too late for that now i guess"

"schrecklich",2011-06-07,"as others have stated it really was clear that grrm wrote this episode or at least this episode deviated the least from the plot in the books i wonder though if faithfulness to the books was why this episode to me seemed to have some many moments where the audience was asked to overlook things for instance when tyrion goes into tywins camp with the clansmen were there no scoutsguards posted outside the camp or do we just assume that they skipped over any challenge he received for bringing in a huge host of armed fighters or with robb winning over the northern lords  they show umber and grey wind but its still a stretch to me that just from that one scene that all of the northern lords would fall in line to go to war with a green boy there were other smaller moments too i wasnt really convinced by tyrions winning over of shagga i think these are just the kinds of leaps that are required to squeeze the series into such a small amount of screen time if the jumps get too big though the show will become difficult to watch edit oh regarding the scout counting i just assumed what was meant was that the scout was probably sittingstanding still for a while staring at the army maybe he made some pointing gestures with his hand as he did so perhaps his lips were moving slightly as he mouthed the numbers i doubt he was ticking off the troop numbers on his fingers edited by schrecklich 07 june 2011  1227 pm"
"Bronn Stone",2011-06-07,"robbs ploy with the scout is made that much more effective by his not having shared his plans with the greatjon or his mother or his other lords they are as fooled by him as the scout is that way the scout will report to the lannisters that not only was the soft child merciful but that he disregarded the advice of older and wiser men extremely well done booksrobb would not have come up with this trick this early on but tvrobb is older and doesnt have the blackfish yet"

"Arya The Assassin",2011-06-07,"this was also the lowpoint for me as the guards were all in heavy armor  whats the point of your helmet it a wooden swords can send you flying while wearing ita helmet can protect you against fatal cuts or blows but youll still feel the kinetic impact imagine that youre wearing a helmet and that someone is hitting you on the head with a solid wooden stick or bat i believe syrio had some kind of lead core in his training sword the hit wont kill you but youll still feel the force of the blow and itll probably disorient you for a while due to concussion or even cause unconsciousnessbesides syrio attacked the unprotected areas of those guards the neck lower arms and legs the guards didnt wear neck protection hitting those smaller areas with such speed and precision requires a lot of skill not to mention the coordination of syrios attacks against multiple foes but thats one of the ideas behind this fight as written in the book and shown onscreen technique and skill wins over brute forceheres a summary of the fightguard a swings his blade against syrio but misses and syrio whacks his head with a right swing the guard loses balance and falls to the groundguard b thrusts his blade but syrio sidesteps the attack and grabs the guards cape the guard is struggling to keep balance as hes being pulled backwardsguard c hacks with his sword but syrio strikes the blade sideways and lets his own blade hit the backside of the guards lower leg on his downward thrust the guard loses his balance and fallsguard d prepares to take a swing at syrio whos still holding the cape of guard  but syrio is faster and hits the guard on the unprotected area of his lower arm the guard almost freezes due to shock or pain but manages to hold on to his swordguard b still being held by syrio swings around with his sword but syrio ducks and the guard hits guard d in the head instead guard d goes downsyrio turns around and hits guard b on the throat with his sword this can be lethal and would definitely keep this guard pacified for the rest of the fight guard b goes downguard c is on his feet again and prepares to attack syrio but syrio is faster he turns around to face him and strikes his head with full force guard c goes downguard a is also back in the fight but syrio parries his blow and hits the guards lower leg the guard loses his balance and syrio tackles him before hitting his head guard a stays downsyrio turns around to face the kingsguard commander the commander thrusts his sword but syrio deflects it they slash and parry until the commander grabs syrios sword and splits it with his swordnotesmost of the guards were only temporarily taken out concussion minor injuries etc so syrio wouldnt have much time before the other men rejoined the fightsyrio does not try to grab another sword immediately after his own sword is broken instead he blocks the commander so that he cant reach arya protecting arya and letting her escape has much higher prioritywe dont get to see what happens after arya leaves the scene but syrio would probably try to buy arya some additional time so his first priority would be to get another sword fight defensively and keep the entrance blockedsooner or later he would have to flee because fighting the commander in addition to the other guards would most likely be too challenging even for a master swordsman like syrio it would serve little purpose anyway since his primary objective is delay the commander and his guards not to kill themsyrio should have no problems running away from the guards hes not wearing bulky armor as long as he doesnt get surroundededit removed a lot of empty space edited by arya the assassin 07 june 2011  1252 pm"

"Arya The Assassin",2011-06-07,"i dont really claim that the scene is highly realistic but rather that it doesnt stand out too much since almost no show fighting is very realisticyes onscreendramatized fighting is often more or less stylized but for a good reason a highly realistic fight scene might actually not look that cool or it might not fit within the alloted screentime for the scene there are also security concerns of course my response towards valacirca has more to do with his statements about the fight scene being totally implausible theres a big difference between totallyhighly realistic and totally implausible"

"JohnnyOffice",2011-06-08,"more than likely the lannister scouts spotted tyrion and the hill clans days before they reached the encampment tywin was informed and he gave instructions that tyrion wasnt to be given an honor guard or escort into the camp and that the scouts should just keep tabs on them thats very inline with tywins personality and dislike of his son i also see that aryas stabbing of the stable boy was not accidental shes been training for weeks just removed needle from its scabbard when she spins around and runs him through and thats an accident sure she was afraid and the training took over but its not like she was holding needle in front of her and he got pushed onto the pointy end from behind or she got pushed from behind stabbing him it seemed pretty purposeful to me the expression on her face was very what just happened and what do i do now after but that was more the fear of the whole situation and her world falling apart than the fear of the act talking ned was most definitely not formal with other friendly nobles even those sworn to him he treats king robert extraordinarily informally even going so far as to insult him and say that he was fat in front of a lannister its no surprise to me that his bannermen would call him ned none whatsoever his servants calls him lord stark including maester and septa and thats probably more to do with their own training and upbringing than the rules of his house"

"Athelstane",2011-06-08,"overall an excellent episode the lack of scouts for the lannister camp was odd and i am upset they didnt show moat cailen as the great ruinous swamp tower setup it is also why wasnt the blackfish with catelyn and rodrick when they left the the vale i dont recall if he was there to greet them when they first brought tyrion also the whole timeline of the events in the tv show seems skewed compared to the books i guess going from one medium to the other would do that though the slight change of the nature of danydrogos scenes was very well done instead of wasting time explaining how one khal fell upon another khal etc they streamlined the whole process and drogo willfully letting the dude nick him worked brilliantly though danys overzealous reaction to what appears to be a shallow skin cut was sorta dumb they still got alllloooot to cover in these last two episodes"
"Morrigan",2011-06-08,"the blackfish has been cut and moved to s2 unfortunatelyand yeah drogos cut should have been nastier this really was just a scratch making the whole big deal about requiring a healer pretty silly but that and the hasty stableboy kill are my only complains and theyre all directing decisions not writing so kudos to grrm in what is an otherwise fantastic episode with the best writing yet smilegif classbbcemoticon alt  i hope theyll still show the hound getting accepted into the kingsguard though i was sad to see that go its a pretty important scene so im assuming hoping they just moved it to e09 edited by morrigan 08 june 2011  0408 pm"

"Maithanet",2011-06-08,"i enjoyed episode 8 a lot the one thing i really wish they hadnt cut was tywin maneuvering the mountain clans to fight for him in the books he says they should fight for him and offers decent weapons in return the mountain men refuse because tyrion already offered him weapons in exchange for his life so tywin starts praising both the hill tribes and the northmen for their martial prowess he says that even his bravest knights fear to fight the northerners and if the mountain men are too afraid then he understands the hillmen immediately scoff at the northmen and agree to fight to prove their ferocity it was a quick about face but it made more sense than what they showed on screen which is that the hillmen seem to have no problem being conscripted into tywins army  plus it showed what a snake charmer tywin can be which is important to establish early on not a big deal but i thought it was something of an important scene"
"AshaÂ<U+0097>Not Yara!",2011-06-08,"i agree its puzzling why that was changed im sure martin had a good reason though i hope for the dvds will get a whole bunch of commentary from him and the producers about everything smilegif classbbcemoticon alt  perhaps they felt the need to shorten scene and the mountain men arent stupid they can see tywin and how rich and powerful tywin is so a chance to fight for him in exchange for all tyrion promised them and more doesnt seem too much of a stretch edited by mellisandra 08 june 2011  0433 pm"

pointcounterpoint id like to take a more um metaphorical approach for those of you on either side please let me know if this has also already been done to death and accept my apology in advance even so it should at least have the advantage of not being as dull as these debates tend to be and mayhaps it will have some entertainment value of its ownversion 1picture if you will a woodland scene with magic surrounding it it is twilight and the shadows of the trees are stretching and deepening in the middle distance we see a small family of deer carefully padding between the trees cropping leaves and nibbling berries the family includes a small young fawn eagerly munching his way further and further from his parents both adults are facing away and fail to notice the ditance growing between them and their offspringour view zooms out and in the foreground an adult wolf has spied the family of deer as this is no ordinary forest the wolf begins to speak to himselfwolf look at those foolish deer wandering around and chewing on twigs someone ought tobut waitno it couldnt beyes it is andrew clovenfoot the most obnoxious deer north of the river and without his band of cronies from the time i was a pup how many of his jokes was i the butt of how many of his veiled insults have i ignored today ser clovenfoot you will learn something of respect your son will suffer the consequences of your foolishnesssilently the wolf pads forward head low eyes locked on the wandering fawn steadily closing the distance each step is measured deliberate quiet every rustle of leaves seems impossibly loud as the wolf edges inexorably forward the fawn pulls a leaf from a branch and chews eagerly the concentration of the wolf on the small fawn is absolute as the smell of deer flesh grows intoxicatingly strong the wolf brushes past a dead sapling little more than a stick with a few dry twigs branching from its top a twig snaps with an audible crack like a gunshot deer heads jerk up ears twitching leg muscles tensing the wolf leaps forward closing the distance to the fawn in two bounding strides deer spring forward launching themselves into full flight but the fawn is slammed to the ground by the crashing weight of an adult wolf jaws close on the front of its neck clench and with one pull rip away a large chunk of flesh and cartilage in a spray of blood the wolf watches the fawns eyes glaze over in the shock that is natures final mercy for prey animals and arterial blood gushes into the leavesthe sound of ripping flesh stops the flight of the adult deer ser andrew clovenfoot proud buck turns and sees the fate of his fawn he stares at the carnage with cold black eyes tail twitchingbuck you even i would not have thought you could stoop so lowwolf you still dare fling insults at me your throat is unprotected serbuck and you ser are nothing more than a coldblooded murderer i will see that you hang for this outragewolf you may try but even the twolegged slaughterers will not convict me for defending my own life your loathsome offspring was trying to starve me to death and so forth and so on hopefully you get the ideaversion 2same story but replace the dialogue above with the followingwolf spies deer familywolf ah hah i knew something smelled delicious uh oh little fawn it looks like you have wandered away from the protection of your parents have you a name i think ill call you lunchwolf kills fawn and begins to feedwolf hello lunchdoe oh my gods that wolf just killed herbert and you just stood there and watched what kind of buck are youbuck have you been licking frogs thats a an adult grey wolf a coldblooded killer if i step anywhere near it ill be as dead as herbert you think i should also die for your bad parenting how many times have i told you not to let the child wander away from usand they all lived happily ever afterso in the context of the arya discussion it seems the question is whether the wolf is a coldblooded murderer or if he is merely acting in selfdefense having read some arguments on either side my question is this what the fuck are you talking about this debate seems as surreal to me as the ridiculous deerwolf dialogue above as a matter of fact when i read the discussion something like the scene above actually popped into my head except it was more elaborate and included a herd of goats watching the scene and having a debate over whether the wolf was a coldblooded murderer yes my mind actually works that way sigmund hisownself would have been hesitant to play free association with mefor clarity my opinion is that arya is on her way to becoming a coldblooded killer and that this is in no way a criticism of her character she is not an orphan trying to make her way on the streets of a big city she is a child of a noble family trying to survive in a world where the rules are far different from ours and war is breaking out all around her she is no closer to being a murderer at least in the connotative sense that the term is being used here than she is to being a computer programmer she has a sense of honor and of fairness she demonstrates loyalty when she deems it necessary she kills without compunction or remorse she is a wolf she isfrantically flipping pages in the mental thesaurussimply magnificentand no you are not entitled to cross this bridge because i did say mayhapsvm"

"Morrigan",2011-06-09,"great post unnamedits easy to justify each kill as selfdefense if your definition encompasses anyone who could potentially harm her if she had killed one of lord berics men it would still have been self defense because she was a captiveof course lord beric and his men are outlaws who are holding her against her will to ransom her if she feels threatened by that and wanted to escape why shouldnt she kill one of them if it helped her do that granted in her ignorance she does not realize that she probably serves her own interest better by staying with them but that would not make her motives for killing sociopathici love arya to death but lets call a spade a spade shes a sociopath but an endearing sociopath shes the daughter you want to have except that she kills people without a second thoughtdo people even read the arya chapters at all its like they focus on the fact that she kills and completely ignore all the rest including her inner thoughts and her motivations which definitely are not remotely sociopathic sociopaths do not feel empathy people sociopathy is defined as a personality disorder characterized by the inability to form human attachment and an abnormal lack of empathy masked by an ability to appear outwardly normal this does not describe arya in any way she does feel empathy she does feel human attachment in fact most of the names on her kill list are people who hurt not only her but others that she cares about gendry mycah and sometimes even people she doesnt even care much but she still feels were treated unfairly lommy  killed by raff the sweetling someone who feels no empathy wouldnt give two shits about lommy being murdered by raff or that gendry got beat up by dunsen and had his helm stolencersei is probably sociopathic to a degree she feels attachment to her children but thats about it in affc spoiler she plots margaerys downfall and jon snows murder by asking the kettleblack to seduce her and sleep with her thus being sent to the wall to murder jon snow and then getting a royal pardon from tommen and returning to kings landing and what is her thought process about this is it i find this plotting distasteful but i have to to eliminate my enemies and keep my children safer in my mind no she congratulates herself at how elegant it is and how she was born for doing this and later on jaime sees her being so beautiful and going through the motions of showing kindness to others and he notices how she could really get people to love her whenever she bothered trying edited by morrigan 09 june 2011  0152 pm"
"Unnamed",2011-06-09,"it is worth noting that at the point that the last book left off arya is basically being trained to be an assassin which means that barring another unexpected plot twist at some point she is going to be called upon to kill someone for no reason other than this is your assignment it think it will be interesting to see how she responds to that and how she feels about it somehow i suspect that they will never be able to rip the arya stark out of her and one way or another such a contract kill will add a whole new angle to this question of aryas moral characterit does seem that her church friends see her as a sociopathor worse a noblewomanand they are trying to teach her that its not okay to kill people that havent been assigned arya stark might have opinions about who deserves to live or die but the faceless assassin would not deserves got nothin to do with it vm"

"Unnamed",2011-06-09,"i dont see it as analogous to your description of the wolf scene at all honestly so since i dont accept the premise not much discussion can be had of the finer points throughout most of the series ayra is solely acting in self defense until she goes to essos then her story changes a bit i still find it a stretch to call her simply a coldblooded killer or to say most of her kills are done in cold bloodthe kill with the guard in particular i 100 completely understand and endorse as self defense he was one of her captors well i was trying to make a point through the use of some uh poetic license the stark sigil is after all a giant prehistoric wolf nonetheless it certainly isnt worth arguing aboutfor the most part i agree with the various points that youre making the only real bone of contention between us is an apparent assumption that the only justification for killing someone is selfdefence and you seem to be continually expanding the definition of selfdefence in order to apply it to every situation i think particularly in this imaginary world that you can kill people for reasons other than selfdefense without necessarily being a sociopathcoldblooded murderer still we are more in agreement than in disagreementi also want to comment on the last killing personally i have always thought that arya was undecided about our minstrel sociopath sorry couldnt resist at the beginning of the conversation i think he sealed his fate when he mentioned lord snow the brother that arya was closest tothe brother who gave her needle without grrm having to include us in her thoughts i felt i knew what they were first of all just hearing his name mentioned probably cut deeper than swords even worse though hearing him being dissed by this selfimportant fop this deserterit seemed to me that she probably killed him without thinking much about it the narrative jumpcut seemed to me to emphasize the fact that she reacted to this outrage without a whole lot of thought the bmovie version would have been the screen fading to redone final point as rare as we like to think that it is the cold reality is that even in our civilized society people kill other people every day and the majority of them the killers i mean are not sociopaths certainly a great many are not nice people what annoys me is the general sense that arya is a fierce killer  arya is a sociopath and listing diagnostic criteria from any version of the dsm doesnt help the diagnostic criteria in the dsm are by definition in comparison to the norms of our world i am quite sure that the dsm at the citadel includes a different set of criteria based on the norms of westeros society more generally the criteria are an attempt to create a checklist for identifying examples of a general type the essense of this general type which we call a sociopath is the general lack of feeling for other humans empathetic or otherwise the prototypical sociopath sees other living creatures human or animal as no more significant than a colony of ants and they are notorious for experimenting with living creatures because they are fascinatedamused by their pain a true sociopath will kill a person for nothing more than the entertainment value of watching their suffering arya most certainly carries a lot of anger resentment and even hate everywhere she goes but her behavior is not that of someone who sees other people as insignficant meaningless ants to be killed or not at her whimsyill be the first to admit that arya stark would struggle in our public school system but this notion of her as a sociopath is just surreal neatly taking us back to where i started in this threadplease go back to my first post and just keep reading them in order as an endless circlevm"

"GoTreviews",2011-06-10,"if she was already on the path of vengeance why did she ostensibly give him good medical care or do you believe that she only pretended to give him good treatment while secretly poisoning the wound confident that she would seem innocent when he disobeyed her instructions that last sentence really needed one more dependent clause to maximize confusioni dont get your point shes a single woman in the middle of a freakin khalaasar how could she have gotten to the khal in any other way than hiding her true motivation that all seems strange to mewell it might seem strange but if you assume she was scheming from the start it makes sense and i do believe that when one way of looking at things makes sense in grrms writing its the good way to look at it instead of going ho but we could also think this and then it makes no sense i dont think we can say she speaks to dany for no apparent reason even if the plan wasnt there yet and then again being a victim of the assault she might had a chance to see the khal get wounded dany seemed powerful enough to make the dothraki stop im not gonna say save her life obviously that might be good enough a reason in itself for mirri to try to befriend her"

"YoDaddy",2011-06-05,"okay so maybe im the oddball of the movie ratings then i have been very stingy with the s so far with a 7 being the best ive given i have admitted more than once that my being a series fanboy has skewed my opinions with all the deviations and such from the books so surprise i give my first rating above a 7 i gave it a ten i liked it so much i think because it felt like they finally followed the storyline to a t for the first time it watched like it read for me unfortunately that is my fucked up criteria for the series so far i dont mind slight omissions or word twists but i cant stand shit in the series that never happened so im happy for once edited by yodaddy 05 june 2011  1109 pm"

"Lord Mord",2011-06-05,"there are some really weird cuts  including a random and useless shot of eddard being kicked and i seem to remember some involuntary hissing as from a sudden small wound but i dont remember why so it cant have been too bad i did think some bits were rushedotoh i think its handsdown the most competent faithful and sincere episode to date and i was flabbergasted and dismayed to see it over so quickly"
"TheEvilKing",2011-06-05,"i gave it an 8 very good for the most part but the two coolest scenes arya and the stableboy and grey wind and the greatjon were disappointing for me"
"Carldog",2011-06-05,"that ep worked for me i gave it an 8 which is high for my standards its the first time this seires truly felt epic which was an element i thought was lacking from the show of course im judging the sieres to the book and that not fair to the sieres it would need to be twenty hours long which would be great to capture the ture nature of a game of thrones"
"GSP",2011-06-06,"great episode gave it a 9 cant remember in the book if roose bolton was in the tent where big john umber lost his fingers but he should be leading infantry within the next episode or so to my recollection"

"BarrileteCosmico",2011-06-06,"i have no major complaints but the episode left me somewhat unsatisfied i gave it an 8 for this reason but the episode was great loved drogo pulling the tongue out of the dothraki very happy they make him go out as a badass"
"Corvinus",2011-06-06,"i gave it a 10 because its my favorite episode so far and i am not just being biased cause marting wrote it one thing i was pleasantly surprised was that unlike every single other episode this one did not have a piece of dialog that was too lengthy and boring and out of character still no flashbacks maybe ned will have one next week just before the end and my biggest disappointment was that there is no blackfish"
"David Stark",2011-06-06,"i forgive the jumpiness of the show considering how much information there is to cover i use the show though to give me the visual for the book however right now i am behind the show in the book so the show is still exciting then the book explains everything for me dont think i will wait a year for book two though but it will still be fun for the show but man only two episodes to go i guess"
"SFA-OK",2011-06-06,"great episode great moments maybe to many moments i think so i give it an 8my big complaint is how much jumping around the world we did we never had a chance to digest a scene before being presented with another so many big story scenes that it was almost sensory overload id hate to be a nonreader trying to pick out everything of value in this episodei was about to post exactly the same thing this has been one of my biggest complaints about the show so far and this was probably the worst episode in that regard i counted literally about 20 different scenes in the course of 57 minutes its just not working for me i think a different approach closer to how the book was written wouldve been much better i was also thinking if i hadnt read the book im not sure id even know what the hell is going on here the scene with jon and the wight ended so abruptly imo also is it just me or has cersei made the same exact face throughout the entire show so far i hope to see these improvements in season 2  more episodes longer scenes better editing in some places better characterization and better writing in some places on the plus side i think the actors portraying robb barristan dany and tryion are all doing a great job 610"
"Daenerys",2011-06-06,"its a 7 for me actually matching my lowest rating of the season despite some really badass moments barristan drogo syrio ravens flying from winterfell just felt a little flat and uneven to me and a pretty lame ending again nothing so horrible i can call it bad overall its quite good but it left me wanting in way that episodes 57 did not nice to see rickon and he even speaks but i am getting worried that robb and sansa are not going to be able to carry it when they have to frankly im already missing roberts presence"
"AshaÂ<U+0097>Not Yara!",2011-06-06,"i guess im one of the few people who really liked the ending i thought it was ominous the way the camera went behind the iron throne and we saw sansa between its spikes which i thought was a neat way visually to foreshadow just how trapped shes going to be for some time to come edited by mellisandra 06 june 2011  0120 am"
"Shepherd6",2011-06-06,"this episode gets my first ten i wonder if as i think someone mentioned earlier i am biased because martin wrote it i dont think soi agree it jumped around a lot and i do wonder if a nonreader would be confused my better half a nonreader wasnt here to give me insight into the nonreader mind tonight loved drogo loved robb and especially loved the great johnfinger biting scene your meat is bloody tough came out just as ive always imagined it sansai dont know still undecided about her i guess catelyn was good too and tyrion as always although i missed the tysha story and hope they take the time to do it right minor quibble was ghost wearing a collar and i guess the dog they have playing him cannot be silent so i will learn to live with that loved it anyway but ive been pretty delighted all along"

"sammycakes",2011-06-06,"solid 9 probably not the best episode of the season but definitely the most entertaining all the robb stuff was extremely well done and i can see myself getting a lot more invested in tv robb than in book robb tyrion stuff was gold as always momoa really showed off his physical acting chops you can see why he works perfectly for conan i didnt have a problem with the locationhopping at all we know all these characters and their situations by now the rampant scene shifts added to the urgency of the episode to the feeling that the shit is really coming down now for every character very minor quibbles  the opening slaughter of the winterfell men seemed a bit stagey as did the syrio forel fight especially so compared to the physicality of the drogo fight lines were well delivered though  the fight vs the wight didnt have the urgency or danger it had in the book also seemed foreshadowed much too heavily  drogos gash doesnt seem deep enough"
"Arrogant Bastard",2011-06-06,"ill give it a 9 very strong episode but a few parts felt rushed i liked the opening dancing lesson and the cuts to the carnage outside however i felt arya killing the stableboy seemed a little rushed maybe because i knew it was coming i wish they had added a shot of her escaping through the dungeons but thats a minor quibble loved the scenes with robb and i liked the greatjon also tyrion meeting the storm crows and shagga was fun i expected him to tell his story to bronn about his background but im sure that will get added in a later episode i remember in one of the making of videos peter dinklage mentioning tyrions horrible childhood so it has to be in the show charles dance is very good as tywin the wall parts were pretty good good this episode but felt a little rushed especially the wight attack i was really impressed with sansa this episode she did a great job in two big scenes and so did joffrey ser barristans dismissal was excellent and im glad they kept in littlefingers nasty quip about dying a naked knight overall very good episode cant wait until next week"
"Asharak",2011-06-06,"i gave it a 10 best episode so far its just baffling how much happened in this episode felt like i had watched 2 episodes in a row i was extremely pleased by the robb scenes from being a secondary character he suddenly felt like the main character at least in this episode both confrontations with the greatjon were great and robb tricking the spy was a wonderful addition before this episode i was afraid the character would get shortchanged but they really fired on all cylinders for him in this episode i hate lysa nuff said syrio vs the lannisters was great the slaughter of the stark household had me in tears for 5 minutes i was especially happy with the jon vs wight scene probably my favorite moment in the book jon trying to kill thorne was a great character moment"
"sammycakes",2011-06-06,"oh forgot my most important critique arya killing the stableboy was a waste of a huge moment this is so important in aryas development yet the killing seems almost accidental like a matter of course is she panicked is she reluctant resolutely determined to survive angry i have no idea based on how the scene was filmed pity"
"Ran",2011-06-06,"a 9 which may represent a 95 not sure see the writing lovely the characters in some cases they just seemed more real to me more like what grrm intended as if he just sort of shaded things a little differently  not in a way that was inconsistent with the show mind you but just  by omission maybe doing things so they came a little nearer the book but while i absolutely adored daniel minahans work in the last two episodes there was some clumsiness in this one that detracted from it just weird little cuts that i didnt understand worst of all was the arya scene with the stableboy which just felt  well amateurish i know i know there was very little time they had to go on to the next thing but i would sooner have trimmed 10 seconds from the lannisters slaughtering the starks to just give that moment more weight so a 995 after a bit taken off for the direction"
"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2011-06-06,"i liked this episode a lot except for the wight fight that scene was so cinematic in the books and so creepy i felt none of that in this scene"
"Ghost Cat",2011-06-06,"i loved loved loved it i had a horrible time watching it  kept loosing my connection so it came across very disjointed but i know it will be even better when i can see it on the big tv on wednesdayi was mildly disappointed in the aryastableboy scene also the rushed nature was alright with me after all she is in a hurry it was the choreography and acting of the stableboy that bothered me that child actor is no maisie thats what made the scene run false for me perhaps it was the direction as mentioned in some previous posts but i also think the choreography and ability of the boy had an affect on the scene toothat small nitpick aside i thought it had wonderful tension and flow i got the feeling of events galloping ahead at a speed no one involved can control or stop thats why i gave it a 10"

"JagfyrBlackfyre",2011-06-06,"this was definitely the most dense episode yet i do feel that it may have covered too many events and as such a few things felt a bit rushed still given the breadth of it and the awesomeness of the new material not in the books drogos especially i still have to give it an eight and an eight for me is not lightly given this episode seems to set up the ninth to be the marquee one of the season obviously ten will have its wild moments as well but after episode eight the tension is set so high that the plot can do anything but explode"

"Abaddon",2011-06-06,"im going to go with 810 as per my comment in the other thread it was just too much crammed into too little time the only scene i actively disliked was aryas accidental killing of the stable boy was glad we got a lot of robb time and also that they are clearly building up theon as very much in robbs trust they needed to start doing that in preparation for season 2 and did it welli thought grrm did a nice job of being very economical with his dialogue still managing to hit most of the high points from the book in very little timealso big props to the actor playing joffrey and in general to the writingdirection in general in the sansajoff scene it was so obviously staged where joff accepts sansas plea graciously despite the protests of his advisors and it was just done beautifully it was weird to see pycelle be so forceful was it like that in the book i cant remember"

"Pink Walder Frey",2011-06-09,"i also thought kevan was kind of off  off for his personality and for the scene iirc he was welcoming tyrion very kindly in a lannister way more than you ever could expect from tywin or cersei leaving out jaimie at this point he just was kind a off in all ways another problem i had with kevan was that he looks imo very much older than tywin as tywin is the older one about kevans character developement i have to disagree a bit with the offered opionions he certainly was kind of a lesser tywin but he also had his own personality greating tyrion kindly in the first way was the best sign for it in the books  tywin did react much different so as many of you pointed out he is very much seconding tywin but he is not absolutley the same  not while tywin is alive and especially not after his death but he just does not have so much screen time he is a loyal follower to his elder brother and he would always back up him but as a character he is not absolutely similar to him while his first appearence did not seem so good to me im confident that itll be getting nearer to the real kevan while story is proceeding what really more bothered me was to see lord tywin smiling in this scene  it was briefly but it was there and i disliked it more than all about kevan and well about other characters mentioned timett was really off as some others pointed out i always imagined him as young but thin and gaunt but on the show he looked like oneeyed sam dressed as a clansman chella loked better but she was looking much too shy for me and while were talking about people looking alike did anyone notice that robb and jon seem more and more to look alike  im not sure if this is just imagination but it seemed to me so also about robb while richard madden was acting very well especially in ep09 i think his hugs are kind of way off  when he hugs someone he seems to gaze into nowhere"

"tyrionsparamour",2013-02-22,"hello fellow fans this is my first post so please dont jump down my throat and if its been discussed before sorry for bringing it up i just got finish watching season 1 episode 8 and right after robb sets a lannister scout free there is a quick scene of ned stark in the black cells and turnkey comes and wakes him up and points to something the scene cuts now i could be wrong but to me it looks like furs plus they dont show the turnkeys face i could just be a stark fan not wanting to deal with his death but i believe this is a clue to something even if you read arya chapter where ned is brought out to the sept she describes a man who looks nothing like ned  i dont have the book infront of me but i do remember her saying she does not recognize him now i think the writers for the show have some knowledge of the future books to portray the story on tv if you pay attention to some scenes the characters talk about things that are not brought up to later in the series and what would be the point of showing that scene if it was just some asshole messing with ned now here is where the crack pot theory ned is alive maybe even the hooded man who knows but i really have a feeling it means something i dont wanna go on because i already feel like im rambling but please give me your thoughts chow and kisses"

"NW Deserter",2011-06-05,"holy crapthis episode was nearly flawless you could really tell george wrote it it felt straight from the books i dont think there were any added scenes at all syrio fucking forel so badass choreography was great for that scene and of course theres still room for him to escape grrm sure knows his fanbase robb got some legit screen time hes up there in the badass category for this week his lines with the greatjon were money tyrions lines were freaking awesome this week and we actually got all three of the hill tribe chiefs didnt expect that arya was awesome as usual but i really need to give sophie turner props for her sansa i really think shes giving that character justice and did well with meaningful screen time drogo just barely edges out robb in the badass category with that throatrip although i thought his wound came from fighting another khalasar not one of his own not a big deal though the wight fight was pretty cool although the wight itself was moving really strangely why did it pretend to be dead for a second rickon speaks that was heartbreaking hodor swings xd only two morebut ill try not to think about that i am really excited to see how nonreaders take these last two episodes a bit of an anticlimactic ending but it definitely put the tension in there it kind reminded me of the ending to lotr the two towers where you have a small glimmer of hope that stuff will turn out well but it fades out with gollum joffrey seeming even less trusthworthy and with eerie music accompanying his scheming only difference is that there wont be a happy ending this time george really should write every episode there were so many recognizable lines from the books"
"Lany Cassandra",2011-06-05,"i actually have a complaint my first one i know i hate myself for thiseven the husband said but george wrote thisthere must be a reason why did robb let the lannister scout go that was just stupid so he added 2000 men to the count 20000 still does not equal 60000 other than that i loved the episode it was amazing 1010"

"MountainThatRides",2011-06-05,"fucking amazing episode easily my favorite so far perhaps because all of the plotlines are picking up speed as we barrel towards the seasons climax and the war the writing was superb this is exactly how i wanted it adapted  a lot of the best bits made it from the book to the screen especially juicy chunks of dialogue we expected no less of course this being georges season one episode but i was very impressed with the pacing the scene transitions everything im sure he had assistance  hes been out of the screenwriting biz for decades  but despite who polished it you can see george in there very clearly moreso than the other episodes despite the fact that every episode has a lot of george in it considering its adapted from his workthe tyrionbronn scenes were great and the introduction of the mountain clans shagga was wonderful and i like how they introduced timmett and chella that scene in tywins tent was very satisfying pretty much exactly what i was hoping for the scene where barristan is decloaked hit me in all the right spots too  littlefingers naked knight quip endeared me perhaps for the first time to the actors portrayal of petyr the syrio fight the greatjons introduction jon dispatching othor the mention of the late lord frey some bits were left out or changed around but as with most of the other abridgments its done with good reason and with good results we got a lot of robb and i thought his acting was great the call the banners line was an adrenaline surge peter dinklage and maisie williams continue to steal the show drogo was a complete bad ass and the chest woundmirri maz duur plotline all lined up perhaps not exactly as it was in the books but it hit all the requisite points my personal favorite line of the episode and one of my favorite exchanges from the first book who do you truly serve varys the realm someone mustmasterful episode"
"Trebla",2011-06-05,"it took 8 episodes but the hound finally came out thanks george this episode was owned by robb stark young wolf baby his scene calling the banners smacking down the greatjon with cat and then letting the scout go great hes baiting lord tywin making himself seem the green boy this whole episode felt like it begins the setup of season 2 osha talks about the dangers beyond the wall we finally have rickon so the audience remembers the youngest brother and his relative impotance in season 2 shaggas goats and the best setup for laters seasonstywin shitting gold good to see kevan and the greatjon"

"Asarlai",2011-06-05,"i actually have a complaint my first one i know i hate myself for thiseven the husband said but george wrote thisthere must be a reason why did robb let the lannister scout go that was just stupid so he added 2000 men to the count 20000 still does not equal 60000maybe it was a westerling eh ehthe syrio fighting scene was a bit weird mostly because i dont think it looked believable at all that he knocked out all those armored men with a wooden swordhe dealt several heavy blows and a few were through visors that was a pretty thick sword"

"smegma",2011-06-05,"while i loved the episode i have to admit i sorta wished for at least one more scene that wasnt from the books because those are some of my favorite parts of the show so far  but i do realize that with all that is going on in the book at this point there really isnt time for anything else i knew they were gonna leave that syrio thing open  damn it i did think the stabbing of the boy a bit rushed but otherwise overall a great episode i actually really like sophie turner i think shes doing a great job with the material shes given whats up with barristan and jorah being so damn hot jesus i think the actor playing jofferey was awesome on the throne perfect i actually got a little emotional knowing what is in store for these characters sadgif classbbcemoticon alt  but mommy im hungry"

"FlipFantastic",2011-06-05,"i wish that rob would have explained to everyone why he made the move and the scout will go and report to tywin that the north is coming while they will instead go and attack jaime it would have made the tactic look like the genius that it is to the normal audience they will forget the finer details by next week when rob crushes jaime"

"Kaitscralt",2011-06-05,"i liked this episode a ton but there still needs to be some senseless nitpicking 1 barristan not mentioning stannis yeah i wanted to hear it oh well 2 the first 15 minutes of the episode seemed very weirdly paced with potentially confusing fight scenes between random people for nonreader scenes lasting just a second and aryas stabbing scene was very quickly done the wight scene was also rushed and they never clearly explained it was the corpse come to life luckily the pacing fixed itself once robb got going 3 varys outfit when he visits the dungeons  bring on the beheading sadgif classbbcemoticon alt  edited by kaitscralt 05 june 2011  0943 pm"
"LugaJetboyGirl-irra",2011-06-05,"damn robb really came into his own this episode he was one of the standouts for me ive felt the actors protrayal of robb has been underappreciated but today he finally got to become a total badass i liked every scene with him and especially the little details of his interactions with maester luwin and rodrick i actually didnt like that every word was straight from the book im a fan of the parts where i dont know whos about to say what this wasnt my favorite episode and i thought the ending was weak but i think that was the directors doing rather than grrm my only major gripe is that the wights eyes werent blue enough so he didnt seem as spooky as the little girl in the prologue scene also thank god there wasnt another awkward uncomfortable sex scene and i am loving me some varys"
"House Snow",2011-06-05,"id also add this episode shows why maybe it isnt such a bad idea to not always have the direwolves present as much as happened in the book it would be pretty damn repetitive if we had gotten to the end of this episode and had dog saves the day scene number 5 and 6"

"Zoren",2011-06-05,"well sansa is never supposed to be liked not even in the books i think her betrayal is a crucial part in showing how stupid and naive she was to run to cersei and i am disappointed they took that out i think this episode portrayed sansa as very sympathetic and that is not who sansa is supposed to be at least not yet it is not until joffreys betrayal that sansa is portrayed in a different more sympathetic lighti think that the reason as to why sansa catelyn and cersei come off as more sympathetic than their book counterparts is because the producers felt that it would be a very bad idea from a marketing point of view to only have one female character whos not entirely unlikeable aryahecka feminist friend of mine who hasnt read the books yet even told me that she felt identified with cersei"

"Rockroi",2011-06-05,"so big night with lots of moments we had been waiting for but none bigger thansyrio forel  all around bad ass i was never high on the roll nor the actor who played him but sf had one huge scene where you either bought him or not and he nailed it i never doubted for a second that six fully armed guys would get their asses kicked by an old dude with a wooden sword but he sold it my only issue was trant who i thought would be more stoic not angry i never doubted for a moment everything they sold in that scene arya was perfect syrio was perfect the fight was greatand yeah while syrioâ<U+0092>s end is still left kinda sorta undefined i am even more convinced heâ<U+0092>s dead that scene spelled out just how doomed he was did trant look like he was laying around or that he would let him live i just hope welcome back kotterâ<U+0092>s juan epstein can get work again khal drogo finally i liked the seemingly superfluous khal drago fight scene yes i wish his wound would have been more true to the book as well as the whole reason for the battle i did not enjoy the indication that the battle was fought for the race for the iron throne but watching drogo make his claim for bad ass was great and nice use of a prosthetic tongue ultimately i loved most every aspect of that scene because with the exception of the items mentioned above it was true to the book and i thought it all worked outthe weight of the game of thrones the best aspect of this episode was watching the immeasurable weight that fell on the shoulders of sansa stark i thought the episode nailed describing how helpless she was in the jaws of these lions placed there by the way by her loving father and note i loved that the show did away with the foolishness that sansa had anything to do with her fatherâ<U+0092>s demise ned had those bases covered already the actress playing sansa exuded the peril of her situation the show detailed the force all subtle â<U+0096>pressed onto her by cersei varys etc the last scene was truly special from barristan walking out to sansa kneeling there was no question that these people had this all spelled out and were contorting poor sansa and the love she had for her father against her and the fact that sansa logically saw her roll as that of savior for her father was understandable and honest a great set of scenes culminating in a really good shot of sansa sinking under the weight of the throne itself robb stark development of a warrior i loved how robb developed in this episode and how he grew into his roll he is not sure certain or positive but he acts like a man who is confident that he is giving his family the best chance of survival against the forces of evil lannister i thought the scenes with greatjon and cat all went very well i also liked how he is afraid but determined in other words i thought he was robb stark before he went stupid the mehtywin lannister my favorite bad guy seemed a bit too enthused at robbâ<U+0092>s moves did he forget where he was he just seems too excited for a man who is supposed to be stoic and stern also i am pissed that they did not keep the original dialog with shagga tywin uses deft subtlety to have the tribes fight with him tyrion says as much instead a very heavyhanded interaction one we would expect from an average scifi fantasy story not martinâ<U+0092>s agot the disappearance of arya stark i know why they did what they did but i thought the scene was rushed i thought it was sloppy confusing and unremarkable the scene i am talking about is when the stable boy dressed like the genie from aladdin discovers arya that scene is terrifying in the books and then grotesque as arya kills a boy itâ<U+0092>s a very important scene in aryâ<U+0092>s development in the show its so fast the voiceover so bad the camera cutting so confused that it has no emotional impact at all now i know why they did this they do not want to dwell on the killing of a 12 yearold boy i got that but i thought the scene was a letdown the minimization of bran stark the one scene i missed was the one in the books where robb unburdens himself to bran in the book its touching and very telling about the pressure robb was under and how he needed bran in the book its as close to a brothertobrother relationship as we get instead we get a rushed scene with all the cliches about how the younger brother wants to go with the older brother and then a rushed explanation with the lamest excuse ever that robb has to move his army out at night robb youâ<U+0092>re moving 18000 men how subtle do you think you can be buddy the salvage operation is that apparently the starks let rickon out of his cell to be kind a creepy and downtrodden and seeming as old as bran i thought this was the least they could do otherwise a really disappointing scene that could have been wonderful and it leads me to this complaint you donâ<U+0092>t have time for a really solid emotional scene between the brothersâ<U+0085> but you do have time for us to see hodorâ<U+0092>s cock really jon snow and the emo that never ends heâ<U+0092>s just not improving sam is jon is not overall a solid but unspectacular episode that i liked but know will sort of morph into the background when i get the dvds"

"Bronn Stone",2011-06-06,"the version in the book made sense because we knew that stannis was investigating it with jon arryn that hasnt been introduced in the show so it would feel entirely random if he just somehow knew all along and hid somewhere while the lannisters committed treason and killed his brother they can have a scene with him talking about neds letter rather then have unnecessary exposition about how he was really working with jon arryn the whole time and we just never knew about itthen why is he hiding"

"Eponine",2011-06-06,"i so hope when we see roose bolton hes wearing pink i have liked sansa from the very beginning and found her sympathetic  you guys know in the books that shes eleven right i thought that she was portrayed in a way thats consistent with the book in this episode  when she comes before the court she is not outwardly emotional she is very very careful of how she presents herself this does seem a bit at odds with how she acts in earlier episodes though i think that the implied chronology of the show makes her betrayal unnecessary because the show appears to stretch things out so that cersei has all the time in the world to prepare after ned is the stupid one who tells her everything he knows theres no need for her to have had any other information this episode and ep 6 have been my favorites so far show robb was better than book robb in these scenes  maybe for me a result of getting away from cats hes my precious baby all grown up pov varys has also become a more real character to me  i find him fascinating in the book too but found it hard to believe that someone could really act and talk like him but he makes it work i wish that the relevant episode had given time to developing the sansan relationship because his appearance and her reaction seemed disjointed relative to the show although makes sense to readers i do not like the casting of osha lysa is still an awesome villainess i dont think the tysha story is necessary at this point  there has already been a lot of exposition in the show and i think it will fit better next season when tywin is reluctantly sending tyrion to court but warning him not to take shae"

"The hairy bear",2011-06-06,"ill admit i am disappointed with the episode mainly because i had very high expectations with george being the writer i would rate this opposite better than the first four but below episodes 5 to 7one of the things i was dearly hoping to see were new scenes told from outside the povs perspective i was hoping that george would take the chance that the tv allows him and show us scenes that he couldnt have been included the books he did this a little by showing robb with a little more depth but i wished he had done much more of thisim also in a minority when i say that i didnt like syrios last stand yes it was very cool but i want it realistic not cool the way syrio basically rendered 4 armed and armored men at arms ko with a few fints was laughable also arya killing the stableboy was a weak scene truth be told those faults lay in the direction more than the writing but ive also have some complain for george this is very personal but i hated that syrios fate as in death was not left clear there was a reason in the books since its told by aryas pov but here george had the perfect oportunity to put all this syriojacen nonsense to restit would have made more sense if the spy had seen less forces than there were that way the spys report would support robbs plan of making tywin believe all his army was engaging him in the green fork with the actual info i really dont see the point of the scene and hodors appearance was completely needlesswell sansa is never supposed to be liked not even in the books i think her betrayal is a crucial part in showing how stupid and naive she was to run to cersei and i am disappointed they took that out couldnt disagree more george himself has expressed his surprise with the hate some fans seem to aim towards sansa and catelynthere are strong reasons to leave sansas betrayal out for one she is already one of the characters that have been worse treated in the adaptation all the scenes that left her in good light and showed her as a passionate and good hearted girl have been left out how she cleverly deduced the identitites of the small councils members how she shone in the tourney of the hand in the books she always tried to please everyone and in the series comes across as a spoiled brat but most of all the aging up of the characters would have painted sansa in a much worse light it makes sense that an eleven year old sansa would explain to cersei that she was sad to leave without understanding whats at stake here but the older sansa of the tv adaptation would know this to be treasonthen why is he hidingi agree that its a very good option to have stannis learn of his rights through neds letter it simplifies things which is needed in the adaptation and in the tv series it is never said that stannis is hiding for all we know stannis is not part of the small council and sulking in dragonstone edited by the hairy bear 06 june 2011  0252 am"

"Ser Warpechowski",2011-06-06,"10 pages and no one mentions how rlj has just been disproven by this episodewhen jon throws the fire at the wight he clearly gasps in pain from the heat this would be a very odd detail to include  by the author himself no less  if they want to make it canon that targaryens are down with fireactually i dont think this means anything and viserys was shown to feel heat as well but he was no dragon this was just such an odd detail to put in if they want us to believe that jon is targaryen and a dragons head or whatnotin the books unlike the tv series dany doesnt seen to be imune to fire actually the only scene where she endures fire unharmed is when the dragons are born there arent other scenes showing she is imune to firealso in the books jon gets harmed by the fire its not something from the tv series"
"zippypoodle",2011-06-06,"i was very annoyed when they retconned sansas treachery out in episode 7 most of you said well hear about it later from cersei well maybe but the clock is ticking well seei thought the sansa betrayal was a bit redundant anyway ned had already told cersei he knewthe only thing the extra information did was let her know he was about to make his move which she had to already know anyway it wouldnt bother me really if that were changed for the show since the writers seem to be taking a slightly different direction with show sansa than we see with book sansa"
"Ser Warpechowski",2011-06-06,"ill take it a step further and say that the prevalence of hate toward some characters at times makes me absolutely ashamed to be a member of this fanbase and sometimes makes it difficult to justify from an adult perspective its just such an ugly word such an ugly concept such a disheartening thing to know that reason has left the building and that these supposedly sophisticated fans of an intricate series of books are basing their opinions without any neurons firing north of their spinal column granted these are only fictional characters but i cant help but wonder if these same people use the same stunted thought patterns in their everyday lives that the hate seems disproportionately skewed toward female characters raises a whole nother can of ugly conclusions to be drawn i guess some people are just wired differently its a depressing thoughtits easy to understand it we barely have fantasy books with female perspectives most of us are used to read books from male perspectives when you imagine cat releasing jaime for the sake of her children its easy to understand if youâre a woman but not if youâre used to the idealistic honor that you usually see in most booksgrrm is so good because it has so many new conflicts and interesting characters that most other books dont have its also easy to hate cersei for using poison and sex apeal when youâve never been a woman and has never been afraid to walk in the streets at night because any man no matter how weak he is is probabily stronger than you cersei has to use whatever powers she have and considering her limited wits and actual political and military power she has i think she does a good job in most of the books after all she is trying to protect her children and i think that is a valid reason to do what she does even if most people dont understand it"
"kungtotte",2011-06-06,"i dont think that anyone who criticizes something that happens as in the books should not talk so much but in any case its all in the execution we can read in the books how syrio beats four menatarms but still imagine it that he has done it with great effort and with a certain dose of luck you can also imagine that those men were lightly armored illtreined and caught of guard that was my interpretation at least the tv version had syrio doing it almost effortlessly and without any trace of fear and i wasnt satisfied with it in fact it shouldnt have been much difficult for tv syrio to pick one of the real swords from the fallen guardsmen to face trant instead he decided to be cool throw the badass line of not running away and face death as if he wasnt worried at all spoiler three of them started forward chainmail clinking softly with each step arya was suddenly afraid fear cuts deeper than swords she told herself to slow the racing of her heartsyrio forel stepped between them tapping his wooden sword lightly against his boot you will be stopping there are you men or dogs that you would threaten a childout of the way old man one of the read cloaks saidsyrios stick came whistling up and rang against his helm i am syrio forel and you will now be speaking to me with more respectbald bastard the man yanked free his longsword the stick moved again blindingly fast arya heard a loud crack as the sword went clattering to the stone floor my hand the guardsman yelped cradling his broken fingersyou are quick for a dancing master said ser merynyou are slow for a knigt syrio repliedkill the braavosi and bring me the girl the knight in the white armor commandedfour lannister guardsmen unsheathed their swords the fifth with the broken fingers spat and pulled free a dagger with his left handsyrio forel clicked his teeth together sliding into his water dancers stance presenting only his side to the foe arya child he called out never looking never taking his eyes off the lannisters we are done with dancing for the day best you are going now run to your fatherarya did not want to leave him but he had taught her to do as he said swift as a deer she whisperedjust so said syrio forel as the lannisters closedarya retreated her own sword stick clutched tightly in her hand watching him now she realized that syrio had only been toying with her when they duelled the red cloaks came at him from three sides with steel in their hands they had chainmail over their chest and arms and steel codpieces sewn into their pants but only leather on their legs their hands were bare and the caps they wore had noseguards but no visor over the eyessyrio did not wait for them to reach him but spun to his left arya had never seen a man move as fast he checked one sword with his stick and whirled away from a second off balance the second man lurched into the first syrio put a boot to his back and the red cloaks went down together the third guard came leaping over them slashing at the water dancers head syrio ducked under his blade and thrust upward the guardsman fell screaming as blood welled from the wet red hole where his left eye had beenthe fallen men were getting up syrio kicked one in the face and snatched the steel cap off the others head the dagger man stabbed at him syrio caught the thrust in the helmet and shattered the mans kneecap with his stick the last red cloak shouted a curse and charged hacking down with both hands on his sword syrio rolled right and the butchers cut caught the helmetless man between neck and shoulder as he struggled to his knees the longsword crunched through mail and leather and flesh the man on his knees shrieked before his killer could wrench free his blade syrio jabbed him in the apple of his throat the guardsman gave a choked cry and staggered back clutching at his neck his face blackeningfive men were down dead or dying by the time arya reached the back door that opened on the kitchen she heard ser meryn trant curse bloody oafs he swore drawing his longsword from its scabbardsyrio forel resumed his stance and clicked is teeth together arya child he called out never looking at her be gone nowlook with your eyes he had said she saw the knight in his pale armor head to foot legs throat and hands sheathed in metal eyes hidden behind his high white helm and in his hand cruel steel against that syrio in a leather vest with a wooden sword in his hand syrio run she screamedthe first sword of braavos does not run he sang as ser meryn slashed at him syrio danced away from his cut his stick a blur in a heartbeat he had bounced blows off the knights temple elbow and throat the wood ringing against the metal of helm gauntlet and gorget arya stood frozen ser meryn advanced syrio backed away he checked the next blow spun away from the second deflected the thirdthe fourth sliced his stick in two splintering the wood and shearing through the lead coresobbing arya spun and ran in the tv show he is striking at their unprotected faces throats and legs grabbing their cloaks so i reiterate my point that maybe people shouldnt complain when things are lifted almost exactly from the book and put on the screen unless you are also complaining about the way it is depicted in the book in which case its really a whole separate topic noalso going for one of the guardsmens swords would mean taking his eyes off of ser meryn a dangerous proposition edited by kungtotte 06 june 2011  0804 am"

"Ser Greguh",2011-06-06,"and here you see i think the show has all but confirmed rlj and that the primary reason for no toj flashback is that it would make it too obvious this comes mostly with the scene between jon and ned where they say goodbye jon asks ned about his mother and in neds reply he is on the verge of tears by far and away the most emotion that bean has been allowed to show contrast this with when robert asks him about the common girl he bedded and his reaction is just cold annoyancein the books catelyn supposes that whoever jons mother was ned must have loved her very much rlj detractors usually need to dismiss that as incorrect or explain away how this girl that ned was so passionately in love with that he forsook his sacred marriage vow doesnt get a single mention in fifteen ned pov chapters contrasted with lyanna whom ned thinks of all the time the scene between jon and ned all but screams from the rooftops that ned indeed loved jons mother very much which aligns very much with rlj and makes the arguments against it all the much more tortured and difficultnobody that i am aware of has ever reasonably supposed that being a targaryen automatically makes you immune to fire if this were the case rlj would have been dead in the first book as jon burns his hand almost exactly as it is depicted in the show this is such a ridiculous strawman that i almost have to think the people making it are consciously trolling"

"Aeron Greyjoy",2011-06-06,"after sleeping on it i think my main complaint with the episode is like my complaints from eps 24 too much too quickly i feel like the show had really settled into a good groove with episodes 57 where the focus narrowed down and more time was spent with each locationwhich to me at least is just an indication that these are the places where the adaptation suffers most from being 10 episodes instead of 12 i dont think theres anything to be done about it unless they decided to start cutting whole key plot points and i am glad they didnt do that theres just too much story to cram into a single hour and its required to set up episodes 9 and 10 i just hope that those two episodes dont feel quite as rushed because that would be an unfortunate way to end a very good first seasonalso the ending was terribly anticlimactic for me the worst ending yet not the worst scene i actually quite liked it just the worst last scene in an episode that left me on a more sour note than i otherwise would have had i thinkwaiting this week is going to be toughi liked grrms subtlety of showing the pointy end of the throne at the end and its lead to sansas demise she does appear to lose her whole family while at court in kl and joff sitting amongst the swords on the throne it was a more subtle ending but shows cool foreshadowing for nonreaders and a nod to us book lovers edited by aeron greyjoy 06 june 2011  1047 am"

"StrongBelwas",2011-06-06,"by far the best episode of season 1 you can tell that grrm was directly involved by the little things you saw such as the fact that syrio didnt die onscreen one of the great things preserved from the 1st book was that we never knew syrios fate because as his opponent closed in for the kill arya ran as the scene was playing out syrios lines were cut almost wordforword from the book and just like in the text arya runs at that last moment bravo i have no issues this episode not even the little small things i usually dislike the fact that drogo took his wound from an insolant follower rather than in the sacking of the village of lamb men seemed better to me than the same sequence in the book if i had one complaint to vocalize it would be to say that the opening sequence missed its chance at a little detail that i previously mentioned the baratheon stag observed on kings landing in the clockwork opening should have been changed to the stag and lion reared on hind legs as is presented in the back of clash of kings jofferys sygil is not roberts i was sorry to see that they missed that"

"Xenophon",2011-06-06,"hey the boards working againgreat episode not much to say that hasnt been said before grrm did a fantastic job especially with the dialogue which was infinitely better than the past couple weeks also i thought it was very clever to give the greatjon a few more lines shooing everyone out when cat arrives if all we had was the scene with him losing his fingers it might have seemed a bit dare i say it cheesy as if he had a miraculous character change having him still bossing the other lords around made it much more believablere arya and the stableboy i agree it was too quick if you were looking for it to be the same as the scene in the book but i felt like this was a substantially different take on scene in the book a key part of the scene is that arya forgets all her lessons except the first stick them with the pointy end in the show i grrm decided they didnt have time to spell this out so they just went with arya stabbing him almost instinctively which worked well but didnt give me quite the same sense of how terrified she was personally i would have showed the stableboy clutching the blade and cutting his hands but that might have started an is arya a monster argument in the twop unsullied thread so perhaps it was best as isin light of the complaints about sexual exposition i cant help to be amused at the lack of complaints about violent exposition like drogo literally ripping someones throat outfor me the difference is that they then didnt have drogo tear open magos chest and rip out his spleen and heart after the tongue showing a scene of sex is fine showing a scene of violence is fine  it is when they extend a scene like that without reasonagreed also the sexposition that everyone objects to so much isnt just the showing of sex its the technique of putting a sex scene in the background when you want to do some plot exposition if they had scenes where characters explained something about the backstory at lenght in the middle of a violent fight im sure people would mock that too"

"Tywin's bastard",2011-06-06,"agreed also the sexposition that everyone objects to so much isnt just the showing of sex its the technique of putting a sex scene in the background when you want to do some plot exposition if they had scenes where characters explained something about the backstory at lenght in the middle of a violent fight im sure people would mock that toothats incorrect i know what ive read and it goes way beyond the littlefinger scene and theres been enough of it to make john bradley say some well chosen words on it in the wic interview i must have been stepping on some toes though since this is the second person that hasnt said the things i laughed at but still felt the need to defend himself that always makes you wonder if youve hit on something thought but not yet said since otherwise theres no reason to get defensive edited by tywins bastard 06 june 2011  0630 pm"

"Ser Warpechowski",2011-06-06,"oh good looks like the site is backup in regards to this and the previous question asking why robb let the scout go seems like a lot of people missed the potential bit of genius behind it this is still speculation on my part but remember we dont actually know how many men robb is leading when told the scout was counting their men he simply asked how high did you get to which the scout replied 18 20000 considering that the lannisters were able to muster up 60000 men id imagine the northern army should probably number something more like at least 30000 men and the scout either didnt get the chance or didnt properly count them all but now hes going to run back to tywin reporting a 20000 man army so roughly that amount needs to show up to meet him to deflect suspicion that the rest of the army is sneaking around the back to attack jamiehe tells cat he has 18000 some people here said he let the scout go because his figures was 20000 or more now even if the guy thought they have 24000 it wouldnt really change tywins plans because a host 18k or 24k is not that diferent unless its all knights on horses now he let the scout go and said that he was going to kick tywin ass because that way tywin will not realize he has split his forces and so wont warn jaime that part was left out but i guess they will go back to it next episode"

"Xenophon",2011-06-06,"thats incorrect i know what ive read and it goes way beyond the littlefinger scene and theres been enough of it to make john bradley say some well chosen words on it in the wic interview i must have been stepping on some toes though since this is the second person that hasnt said the things i laughed at but still felt the need to defend himself that always makes you wonder if youve hit on something thought but not yet said since otherwise theres no reason to get defensivemaybe i wasnt clear or theres some sort of translation problem here you saidin light of the complaints about sexual exposition i cant help to be amused at the lack of complaints about violent exposition like drogo literally ripping someones throat outmy point was that sexposition  simply showing sex on screen it means showing sex in the background while also giving us some exposition about the backstory ie tyrionros theonros viserysdoreah lfros thus drogo ripping that guys throat out isnt really analogous if drogo had fought the guy while relating the history of the dothraki it would have been violent exposition this was just a violent scene more analogous to the straight up sex scenes between danydrogoif all you meant was that people seem more offended by the graphic sex than the graphic violence then i see your point i still think there is more sexnudityforthesakeofhavingsexnudity than there is violenceforthesakeofviolence but it is notable that there wasnt much debate over whether gregor killing his horse was really necessary compared to the discussion of ros although that probably has a lot to do with the fact that shes not in the booksbut whats even weirder and whats been bothering me was why use the wooden sword at all ok maybe for the first guy but the way the scene was staged syrio had plenty of time and plenty of opportunities to switch out the practice sword for a real one with his dispatched enemies lying all over but he didnt i just thought that was really weird my only thoughts are that1 he expected to die anyway even if he beat the kg there would be more guards coming and he had no hope of escaping himself so all that mattered was that he gave arya time to escape and once she was gone it didnt matter much if he bought her 1 min or 10 2 he isnt used to the balance of those swords he did emphasize that his style of fighting requires great precision and is very different from the knights dance so maybe he figured he was better off with his own practice sword than an unfamilar blade and after the kg breaks his blade its perfectly reasonable to assume that he didnt dare drop his guard"

"The Scabbard Of the Morning",2011-06-04,"im not really sure how much the arya is a sociopath debate makes sense we wouldnt have thought twice about if it had been any other male character in the series except maybe rickon doing the murders exactly bronn is much more of a sociopath than arya yet all i hear is the fanboys talking about how much a bad ass bronn isarya is great love her and hope she gets to personally kill everyone on her list"
"taal",2011-06-05,"i think and hope that this episode will include aryas first kill too judging by the title shes my favourite character and i have been impressed with just about every scene i have seen maisie do so far especially considering her age i think shes done a brilliant job it really gives me faith in her ability to portray aryas full character arc and all that she goes through with real depth and empathy i am also looking forward to the sansan scene because im not really sure how theyll pursue that particular relationship in the series i doubt well see any toj flashbacks but perhaps ned will have a little monologue with varys when he gives the letter to him also looking forward to seeing more of robb its about time i wonder if the line about family from cat is directed at him or at his aunt its going to be a good episode but then theyve all been shaping up excellent cant believe weve only a few left i very much hope they extend season 2 though i dont suppose they will"
"Morrigan",2011-06-05,"im guessing its ser meryn trant but it sounds like some nifty preview editing changed the line from dont kill the girl to kill the girl the intonation of kill doesnt sound like its from the beginning of a sentence thats my theory anywayyeah it sounds weird and they certainly would not want to kill such a precious hostage so either its a weird edit or theyre referring to another girl but im not sure who it could beshe is the only character in the entire book that keeps a list of people she wants to killfor vengeance thats pretty much antisociopath since its based entirely on feelingsshe is a mass murder sicrolleyes2gif classbbcemoticon altrolleyes  not even close robb stark is more a massmurderer than she is who feels very little remorse why should she feel remorse towards the tickler polliver weese chiswyck etc if anything she should probably be happier at their deaths than she really is when she learns that joffrey is dead she thinks that she should be happy about this but for some reason she just feels empty she thinks what does it matter if joffrey is dead if robb is dead too a sociopath wouldnt remotely have this train of thought edited by morrigan 05 june 2011  0335 am"
